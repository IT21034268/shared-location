3,RINGMASTER (1993),"Honestly, this is the worst release yet to come from INSANE CLOWN POSSE. It is quite dull, and lacks the unique flavor that came from CARNIVAL OF CARNAGE (1991) and BEVERLY KILLZ 50187 (1992). After this, they rebounded with true classics, such as THE TERROR WHEEL (1994) and RIDDLEBOX (1995). Here, there are a couple good songs, especially ""Murder go round"". This album is better than TUNNEL OF LOVE (1996), but not as good as THE GREAT MILENKO (1997) or FORGOTTEN FRESHNESS 1-2 (1998). It is not even comparable to AMAZING JECKEL BROS. (1999) or BIZZAR and BIZAAR (2000). It has a similar stlye to PSYCHOPATHICS FROM OUTER SPACE (2001)or PSYCHOPATHIC RYDAS DUMPIN' (2001). However, if you like gangsta style music, you might want to check this out, along with RYDEN DIRTAY (2002), TALES FROM THE LOTUS POD (2002), or the new release FORGOTTEN FRESHNESS 3 (2002)."
5,Very classic ICP,Starts off like a m*th*rf*ck*r. Trails off al little bit but still is down wit tha clown b*tchboy
2,"Same stuff , new cover !","nothing new, if you have already bought a couple of books of feng shui, this is same information with different cover,"
2,Child's book,It was a child's book that I ordered by mistake. I thought it was another book by the same title.
4,Better than his previous albums.,"This young goodlooking Greek singer has a fresh voice and a great presence on stage. Greek Music has had it's ups and downs in the past few years, still a lot of trashy music comes out all the time.The album ""O 21 os Akatallios"" shows a variety of songs all nicely recorded. Highlights, ""Se Thelo San Trelos"" & ""Kanoume Oniera""Yes, this is commercial (Greek) Pop but it's fun!Recommended."
5,Elvis14 genuine reproductions,"I just received this as a Mothers Day gift from one of my daughters. I found it to be a very good collection of items. If you are a true Elvis fan, you will love it. I especially loved the 3rd grade report card. Seeing the 9 collectors cards brought back memories! I had every one of them and when I had my first baby, my Mom and husband (now my X) threw them out. I didn't need my Elvis stuff anymore! I was a new mother! What did they know? I have never forgiven them for it. If you buy this item, I am sure you will enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks to my daughter! She is great!"
4,In Broad Daylight,"The book was of great interest to me as I travel to the area regularly. Although it is a true story, the conversations between the people seemed very plausible and were good reading. The book read quickly. This needs to be made into a movie."
1,Self Published,"Self Published for a reason. Enough Said. In an interview, Fodemon said every publisher rejected it, I wonder why?"
5,Honest Insight That Needs to be Taken Seriously,"This book should be read by any person who votes, or will be voting within the next 5 years. Jason Fodeman has taken published facts from both print and visual media and organized them according to topic and content. He then has expertly asked some very pointed questions that all of us should be asking ourselves. Is there a double standard for public figures in regards to values, morals, and ethics. Why do ""adults"" dismiss or look the other way for public figures? How can adults expect youth to not do the same? Just how unbiased is the media? Finally, Fodeman outlines why those 25 years and younger hold the views they do when it comes to politics, morals, values, and ethics. Anyone who would disagree needs to step foot is a high school or college classroom and really listen to this generation. Fodeman has the courage to tell it like it is, to tell what the american youth is trying to say, but very few ""adults"" are willing to listen to or accept."
2,How are the Clinton's different from other Politicians?,"Yes, I agree that the Clinton's were not the model of practice what you preach, but they're different from most politicians and people in power trying to save face how? It's impressive that a 17 year old is informed well enough to have a political opinion about the subject, while most kids around his age seem more concerned with dating and school parties. What's a shame is that his tone seems more partisan than truly informed. I'm sure the diehard Clinton basher's will adore the book, but I'd be surprised if most people took it seriously."
5,Garage Clean-Up,"I purchased this item for my Dad on his birthday. He wanted some hand cleaner towels for the garage after working on his bike or cars. He had another brand listed on his wish list he saw at a ""big box"" store but I found these to be far superior and he does as well. He really likes the two sided feature with one side having more deep cleaning power/texture to remove the grease. I have used the Fast Orange hand soap and really liked it so these were a sure bet and hope to get some for myself in the near future."
2,Sensationalist biased biography,"After reading the Monty's great biography by Patricia Bosworth, I was curious about this book by Robert La Guardia. Unfortunately, I have found this piece of work full of stereotypes and hugely disappointing. Information is incomplete and biased: the author has forgotten about many of Montgomery Clift's closest friends and even about Monty's siblings (who are scarcely mentioned). When it comes to Monty's male lovers, La Guardia uses pseudonyms while subtly conveying the idea of these lovers being responsible for most of Clift's tragedy.I would only recommend this book to people interested in completing collectible material about this great actor."
2,"Loved these, but mine dried up after 2 days!","I was a TA in college and my prof gave us these pens for grading papers, and that's when the love affair with these pens started.I ordered these hoping to rekindle this romance and was very happy...at least at first. Yes they changed the design a bit, but they were pretty much the same, awesome pens. After 2 days, however, the ink started to fail on some of the pens. The black is now more like a grey after only 2 days. Only 2 days! And without much use. I'd send them back if I hadn't torn the packaging open like a starving grizzly bear after some meat.I still love these pens, but I think I got a bad batch."
1,Wish it would arrive,I would like to review this product - if only it would arrive - it has now been well over a month - the suggested arrival date was by the 25th January - but its now the 2 febuary and still nothing - and the biggest pain is there is no way of tracking it. Considering I paid for this way back in December 2010 I am totally outraged by the lack of any communication and will never use this service again.
3,Problem out of the box.,"Received my ""Lazy Pet Poop Patrol Jaw"" today and I think the ""Lazy"" refers to quality control. Both ""pins"" were missing from the part attached to the jaws. Found one in the box, the other one was nowhere to be found. Put the one pin in and could tell right away that it was not going to stay in. Got a couple of bolts and put them in place and it works fine. Will have to see how it holds up after use. Obviously they have quality and design problems."
4,good product,"This is a good pooper scooper. We've gone through several different pooper scoopers over the years, and this one has been the best. The bad news is that it is plastic so it can break - and has for us. But it's inexpensive, easy to spray off and clean, and is easy to use so we've just replaced it a couple times as needed. Considering we have three dogs, we do a lot of scooping."
4,Cool Tool,"Hey, overall it's a cool inexpensive gadget that works. Once you figure out that in some conditions you must apply downward pressure on the actuator spring-loaded handle to properly close the jaws to clutch & remove the object [i.e., pooh-poohs in the grass or on other challenging surfaces] you will learn that it is an efficient and ""clean"" tool. Also, when you get good at it, you will find that it is easy to coordinate the jaws to wing [toss] the foul debris into the woods and go unnoticed. The thing works."
4,Very Good Scooper,"I purchased this scooper just over a month ago. So far, so good. Unlike other scoopers I've used in the past, this one has teeth which does an excellent job getting poops up out of the grass. Very easy to clean with a quick spray from the hose."
3,Poop Scooper,"Concept of product is great, only problem with the item occurs when you're using the lever to grab the waste, it is super stiff and after a few uses your hands are sore from the tension."
4,"Durable, nice Scooper","This is great so far. Only con: Wish it were a few inches longer-I am 5'4, with a back problem. I am not an older person either-in my 40's. Not too much longer, because you do need to be able to maneuver it into wherever you are disposing to. Better yet-make it adjustable-like canes."
5,poop scoop,"works so good to pick up after my dog and not have to bend down to scoop it up. I just transfer it to the pastic bag and the into the garbage can. No mess, no fuss, and it is over in a few minutes. I am so glad I bought it and it is all plastic so nothing to rust.The price was right and it is so handy to have out in the yard to scoop the doo doo up!"
2,Not the greatest movie by any means.,"I thought it notable that Josh Brolin was embarrassed by this movie, and he is the star. It is more of an eye candy flick, with enough violence and shots of prostitute playing Megan Fox, but other than that, the movie was lackluster at best. This was not the best effort from Malcovich, who is really a fine actor in most movies i've seen him in, IMO. The action seemed a bit too contrived, the humor forced, the story gutted. Not at all the way to pay homage to the comic book series."
2,Poor Quality Production,"The production is of poor quality considering that it is in blu-ray. The sound system is just like any other ordinary dvd movie. It is definitely a cheap production movie. Amazon should make good if such cases is made know to Amazon. However, to be fair to Amazon, I have no complaints on all the other dvd and blu-ray movies that I have bought from Amazon.I would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Not bad. Should have been MUCH better.,"There was room for so much more movie here. The look, the feel, of the movie was right and the actors did a good job with what they had. But one hour and twenty minutes? I don't know how much ended up on the cutting room floor, but this movie needed more STORY, more detail, to make it whole. One of the best scenes in the movie was the resurrection of Zeb and his history with Jonah. There was room for more detail about Jonah. Room for more detail about Zeb. And it was not there. Was the plan to get it to commercial television(40 minutes of built in room for ads)? I understand the reasoning behind the two hour movie but I watch movies at home, not in the theater. Give me a good story, don't work with the thought process of a time constraint, even if it means the movie is three hours or more(if I have to hit pause, I can). All that being said, I enjoyed this movie. I just wish it had more content."
2,Not what I expected,This was not at all what I expected. I missed the part that informed that it is a marvel product. I bought it for my husband who is an avid western fan.
1,No movie for old (or young) people,"1) Scriptwriting out of Hollywood Hack 101.2) Megan Fox cannot act.3) At its WORST, the TV series ""Wild, Wild West"" was/is better than ""J. Hex."" The Hollywood wizards took the best aspects of the comic book and discarded them to make a cheesy action movie.4) If you 'subtracted' the CGI f/x from ""Hex"" it would be 17 minutes long.5) Megan Fox REALLY cannot act.6) The producers spent a million or so dollars on the special effects and $1.95 on the script.7) If Ed Wood crawled from his grave, even he could make a better movie than ""JH."""
1,Save your money,"Save your money. If you must see it because you love the trailer, rent it, at least you will not be disappointed by the money you spent going to the theater. I am a big fan of these types of movies and I am telling you, the critics are being way too nice. If I could give it a zero I would. This movie was absolutely horrible."
1,"Gurgle, Gurgle, Gurgle. . .","I really tried to like this one, the casting was great (with one exception, read below) and I have always love the comics. I watched it three times in a row just to make sure I wasn't being to hard on it but to no avail. So anyway to beat a dead horse one more time I will try to keep it short, first I loved Jonah Hex the first time they made the movie in 1976 when it was called The Outlaw Josey Wales, second I have three words for Megan Fox, BOX OFFICE POISON!, and lastly, super powers?, Really!? this one is going right on the the same pyre my Daredevil, Electra, X-men 3, Ang Lee's Hulk, Spiderman 3, Catwoman and Transformers 2 dvd's ended up on. . ."
1,Not safe for chewers!,"My cat chewed half of this toy off and ate it plus the catnip inside. He had bad diarrhea for 2 days. Ended up taking him to the vet to make sure nothing was blocked. He was okay.Please be careful, not a durable toy."
2,Fell apart in 5 minutes!,"My cat loves toys with real fur on them and they are hard to find. I was excited when I found this one on line, but it took her all of 5 minutes to totally pull it apart! The feathers fell out in the first 30 seconds, and then she got the catnip out and all over the floor in about 5 minutes. I'm very disappointed! Glad I didn't spend a lot of money on something that ended up in the trash so quickly."
1,Waste of money,I have used different fragrances before and decided to try this one as I didnt want a very strong smell in my closet. I hardly smelt anything unless you get very close to. Overall very disappointed.
1,Weak,"I bought the citrus version at the local grocery store and one container was strong enough for almost the whole house. The cedar took three days to notice even in a tiny closet. I don't know if they sent me an old product, but what I got was a waste of money. Go with the citrus."
1,Trivial,"I found this book rather trivial. After spending lot of space describing the whole genealogy of different growth rate law, the author tries to show how to transform a set of ordinary differential eqs into a generalized voltera description. The book is written in a very confusing way trying to seem smart."
5,"Wonderful, humorous and sensitive. A winner!","I had to add my 5 stars to the previous 5 star reviews. This is a wonderful story of a native American who rose to success as a DJ in the white man's world but found himself spiritually lost and without meaningful direction. After hitting bottom from alcoholism, he makes an incredible journey to relive the Wounded Knee tragedy and reconnect to his long lost native American roots. Read this book! It will reach deep into your soul and you'll never forget it. Wow!"
4,Solid in-depth coverage - not for the feint of heart,"I've managed to get about halfway through this book so far. It's NOT an easy read. Coverage and detail are excellent, however, and if you're interested in plumbing the depths of how MySql works, I would recommend this book as a solid reference for improving your overall knowledge."
3,Remastered???,"Love most of the songs on this ""grab bag"" CD...some interesting bonus tracks from the vaults...but don't tell me the tracks were ""remastered""! Sounds like the music was recorded in a shoe box; dull, one dimensional, muffled.I'd give this another star if not for the horrible sound quality.IMO, many of the songs on this LP deserved more attention and praise at the time. I was just starting to hit the clubs in 1971 and I remember ""Surrender"" being a crowd favorite. Many consider it a seminal disco record (""pre-disco"" disco)... it should have been stretched to 4:30 minimum play time!""Reach Out"" was a decent follow-on to ""Ain't No Mountain.."" -- same lush arrangements, very dramatic build up...but just not as tight as its predecessor. Sort of builds to a ""so what?"" point...still, it's a classic IMO."
3,OK,"These matches are ok, I have had better luck with the Diamond version of these. These broke more and the a lot of the matches did not stay lit all the way."
3,Its all Greek to everyone,"Everbody should understand that this album is 100% in Greek, not english.If Greek is ok with you its a very nice album."
4,Good Greek music,"Despina Vandi is no. 1 artist in Greece and I think she did a good job with this CD. It is very interesting to see how traditional and modern Greek music go together in her songs.If you are a fan of Vandi, there is no doubt you have to buy it, even if the price is a bit too high from my point of view - normally it should not be more than 16-17 USD. But if you only want to make an idea about contemporary Greek music, try something else, for instance her newest ""Geia!"", which is much better. I am sure you will like her songs as she is not so 'commercial' like other singers are."
4,Great Southern Women,"The characters in her fiction are rich, complex, redeemed and willful. Nora is brave as she faces her pregnancy alone and gives birth to twins virtually on her own, Miss Crystal is a loveable and willful alcoholic who is much more than her behavior illustrates, Freddy is a hopeless and loyal romantic, and Traceleen is my personal favorite with narrations that are vivid and heart-warming. These southern ladies are innovative, eccentric, in pursuit of love and on the rebound from past loves. They are survivors and embody all that makes the South such an interesting place to live. In the vein of Eudora Welty, Gilchrist is a fresh and inspiring voice."
1,"A Prime Example of ""You Get What You Pay For""...","I hope The Ventures are embarrassed that this product has their name on it. They should be. I got ""Giants"" the same time I got the 3 CD import ""Walk Don't Run"". Of all the music I own by The Ventures, the 3 CD import is the best. ""Giants of the Guitar"" is the runt of the litter...."
1,Dreadfully Boring,"It is like having to set through afternoon tea with your elderly English relatives who are arrogant and make assumptions on other peoples lives in which they truely know nothing about. The author's snobbery comes full force into view in this .. """"Novel"""". Just the reference to Jasmin being ""poor"" as if that is enough to constitute a horrible life.I would not recomend any of this writer's books."
3,will martin morning,this popped up with another artist with the same name and again it was the wrong one-this is more jazzy type of music but will try to enjoyed it because i have and ear for the individual(music)n total sounds.
2,You don't have to be Jewish to be bored by this,"Basically this has a brilliant Neil Gaiman short-short story (they've printed it really big with bad illustrations to try and spread it out, but it can't be longer than a page) and a so-so (for him -- okay for anyone else) Harlan Ellison story, and a bunch of unreadably bad/not ready for prime time stories on 'jewish themes' by a bunch of authors you've never heard of, and for good reason"
5,"Warm sound (thanks to D. Lanois), bright compositions","I came across this CD because it had the magic words ""produced by Daniel Lanois"" on it. Plus, I knew Brian's work with Emmylou Harris. It was only when I put the CD into my player that I noticed the label - Blue Note. I was VERY surprised when I heard the first few bars of this wonderful music - given the number of heads in the ensemble the sound is dense but nobody gets in the way of the other players. The compositions are strong - I found myself humming and whistling along to the tunes during the first listening. The guitar playing reminds me of Pat Metheney, which is meant to be a compliment. Brian's CD is in the top 5 recordings of 1998!"
4,"Not bad, a good 50's bop session.","This music swings and has a bop feel to most of the arrangements, so don't look for much cool toned inflection in the album. Would I buy this CD again? Yes. jb"
1,Don't Wast Your Money,"I purchase this CD and I am sorry I did, I feel like I was rip off by buying this so call music CD it is very bad music, The band sounds like they are playing out of key, This group sounds like beginner and not professional at all, I don&#65533;t know how they can put such junk CD on the market, So pass this one up and don&#65533;t waste your time or your hard earn money."
1,Not much Information,"Small pamphlet with limited information on the topic. I had expected a complete 'desk reference' with a lengthy history and background, description of adrenal function, well researched options of what works in terms of treatment, etc. But the pamphlet was missing a lot."
1,A very SMURFED (f-word) up film!!!,"Okay the description on the back is an outright lie. My mom got me the DVD for my birthday, not realizing that the dub was totally different then both American versions I remember from when I was a child. Both of us were very disappointed. She ended up getting the original VHS version for me. Because of this disappointment, I will likely do some research on DVD releases of old cartoons. Likely I will stick to buying old VHS tapes for my more favorite movies and shows (especially cartoons) in addition to DVDs."
1,Had to return,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. TV plays well for a small screen and a black and white. Radio plays. CD would not operate. Motor operates, but I think the laser was a dud. I am returning the unit now to Amazon for a replacement unit."
2,one of the worst yet,"These have to be some of the worst electrodes I've used to date. The adhesive is only good for 1 use, maybe 2, even with cleaning. The edges come up off the skin, the gel on one actually peeled right off the edge when I was removing it per manufacturer instructions after 3 uses, and after just 1 use I don't get the same level of relief, most likely because the gel just wears right off or thins to a negligible amount after a single use. This was a waste of $20."
1,Save your $$$ and time,"The pads are 2x2s... but as for reusable.... barely got past the second days 45 minute use, as they would by the third day slide off the palms of my hand. Next order, I'll purchase a bigger and 'professional' styled pad."
1,How dare these monsters use Christianity as an excuse to strip children naked and beat them!,"People who use these methods are flat out lazy and I'd have to say more dim than a burnt out light bulb.Why would a child not mind if he knows that you don't have time out of your precious day to explain why their behavior is unacceptable but you have all the time in the world to knock the crap out them? I think I'd mind too. The ONLY thing you're teaching a child by using these tactics is that being an abusive, horrendous bully will get you what you want from people.Keep this one little tidbit in mind folks. Your children are going to be the ones who take care of you when you're old and feeble. When your mind starts wandering from old age, your children will remember every brutal, vicious attack you made upon them and when that time comes, you'll get your just desserts."
1,Didn't like it at all,"I just didn't like this product at all. I used it maybe twice, wasted my money"
5,A Great New Edition,"True to his word, IM Silman rewrites his classic with completely new material and examples. Vastly different from the 3rd edition but the core material is of course still there. I write from the amateur perspective of being rated elo 1771. I look forward to working with the material of this book to help me improve my game. If you are completely new to this book, latch on to it. It is the modern day ""My System."""
5,First New Bag EVER!,"yeah, I've had plenty of handmedown bags from other places and my family but it's time that I got a new bag for school. This bag is fantastic! it's strong, efficient, roomy, and has exceeded every expectation that I could have had. Great purchase!"
4,"17"" laptop does not fit","I bought this backtop in hopes that my new 17"" HP laptop would fit. My laptop is too wide and does not fit in the laptop compartment. The quality is great, and I kept it in hopes of finding a soft cover and still placing it in the loose laptop section that is the zipper section closest to your back."
5,Awesome !!!,"I found the quality of the bag to be great, it had what I wanted, more space, more pockets and the fabric and zips and the pads are amazingly comfortable. Great buy and the deliver was amazingly quick."
1,All scripture verses are taken from the king james version!,"Are you serious? Did anybody notice that kempis was a catholic? You know, they printed a king james version because they didnt like the catholc version."
3,religious,purchased as a text book in a class i was takeing at the time. Good insight but i probably would not purchase for myself
5,WAY AWESOME,"I think is the best ever! I got to see them live and it shows part of the performance in the dvd. It also shows the posters we gave them. I learned a lot more about them, and it was just great to see!"
5,Saramago scintillates!!!,What a terrific read. I was captivated by the realism of the characters and the attention to details of their surroundings. Everyone should read this powerful work of fiction.
4,super stopper,"Good product. It is a little to easy to open the door right over it. However, it does stop my 3 year old from opening the sliding glass door too far. I think placing 2 of them will work a little better"
2,Box contains a single stopper,"The box contains a single stopper, but on the back of the package it is very clearly stated that they recommend two stoppers per window. This is sort of like selling a single sock in a package and noting on the back that you need two for a pair. I think it's misleading and should be very clear in the product description or better yet, should only be packaged in pairs. Be aware!Yes, the (single) stopper will prevent the window from being raised, but it's ugly and I think it can be removed too easily by determined child."
1,If you like distorted 78 rpm records this is for you,"I am shocked at all the 5 star ratings. True these are fine voices but a disaster recording outdoors. Poor lighting, no staging, poor recording, blurry cinematography, wind noise, orchestra about a mile away. Opera is a visual and auditory experience. This recording was a failure and I have to agree with the reviewer who called this a Neolithic recording....what a waste. Why did they not bring this fine cast in the studio and record them?...and now they are lost forever...this was as much a failure if not worse then the first Met telecast of La Boheme with Pavarotti and Scotto. Now I have to search for a better Norma even if I don't get Caballe. I will never buy another outdoor recording. Fortunately I found 3 better recordings of la Bahome then the First Met performance."
2,Don't Judge a Book By It's Cover,"I waited a long time to get a new copy of one of my favorite garbage reading books. Sad to say, it looked great coming out of the package but upon reading it, I was very disappointed! It truly was garbage! Being very familiar with the text, the proof reader should be given an eye exam at the least. If proof reading was done by computer, the owner should stop depending on spell check and auto correct! There were too many glaring mistakes in the text to mention, and made for a very hard re-read! I don't recall who the distributer is, but this is extremely shameful! I'm back to keeping my old tattered Pocket Book copy until I can replace this beautiful looking mess!"
4,Completely covered by s02e01,"FYI: All of the content in this episode (near as I can tell) is part of the 90+ minute first episode of season 2. If you've watched all of that episode, you can skip this one."
4,Good for backpacking,"I just finished using this pad on a two-week backpacking trip. It worked fine for me the entire time. It packs small and it is reasonably light. It's pretty thin, so if you are looking for a pad for normal tent camping you may want to opt for a thicker pad. If you get this pad, I would recommend the Trekker chair to go with it. This lets you turn your pad into a camp chair and it works great."
2,Still reading.....,"I don't know what it is, but I can not read this book in one day like I do most books. It's been this way with all of her books. I think the characters are too prim and proper in their desire for one another, if that makes any sense. I mean most books get downright dirty or just makes you swoon at the things that the way they show their interests in one another, whether sexually or physically. Mrs. Forster's books just don't make me hot for more. I'm sorry. And I'm not saying that you have to be a dirty book to grab my attention, but please help me to understand what you are talking about when they talk dirty to one another. Half the time, I'm confused. I won't be quick to buy too many more of her books. I'm sorry."
1,Too Slow,"The book was too slow. I got tired of reading about Naomi, in fact I was tired of reading about her. Her being scared was the focal point of the entire book. The dialogue between Rufus and Naomi was not enticing nor exciting. The non-dialogue sections were boring. I like Ms. Forster's book, but this one, is not high on my list. Too Slow."
2,Not a fan :-(,"I don't know why I keep torturing myself reading books by this author. This is the 3rd book (1st Scarlet Women 2nd Reckless Seduction) that I've tried, and as the saying goes,'three strikes and you're out'. As in the previous books the characters are awful! Caught up in several issues from past hurts and unable to move foward. I can't take the wanting to be together one page and pushing you away the next page...it's just too much. This story, as with the others is just way to slow. And the heroine is depressing. I am a great fan of contemporary romance novels, just not a fan of Ms. Forster's stlye of writting."
1,Are we all reading the same book,"I decided to purchase this book due to the fact that it had all 5 star reviews and that I've read her books before and enjoyed them but to me this one hit an all time low 1 star is stretching it. The leading characters are horrible and I'm using present tense because halfway thru this book I have stopped to review it hoping that I can save someone else from wasting their money. In this book it repeatedly states that Naomi's grandfather is 94 and born of a different time did I miss the part where her and Rufus were also 94 and born of a different time? The conversations hint to this. Wow I can't even bring myself to finish this book. So if your looking for a period piece this is the book for you. Me I enjoy more up to date romance books, the reviews and summary are so misleading I want my $ back..."
2,boring boring boring,the story sounded much better then the movie i actually was looking forward to seeing it but i turned it off after 20 minutes and had to fight to keep it on that long i thought i would see some erotic adventures of 2 guys going into the desert to find this house . but i had to fight to keep awake dont let the picture fool you . this movie would not turn on a 16 old.
2,No subtitles available,"It's a great documentary, but there is no subtitles available. This is the first DVD I bought where this feature is not available."
2,"Gorgeous footage, irritating narration","To its credit, this documentary deserves a lot of credit for tackling a subject that is rarely treated so extensively in nature docs. Moreover, the makers of this film should be creditted for making episodes that cover, ostensibly, unusual habitats that would scarcely get mentioned in most docs, like water tanks.But the biggest problem with this documentary series is the script. How would I describe it?-Largely fact-free (maybe one out of ten statements have a nugget of fact in them; the rest is fluff)-Distractingly hyperbolic-Heavy use of hackneyed phrases and cliches-Very non-specific about the subjects (locations and species are rarely identified)-Excessive anthropomorphism of animals, and even inanimate objects.So, if you are disposed to enjoy docs, you might like watching it despite the problems above. But odds are, you'll just be disappointed."
1,Terrible. Makes Slumber Party Massacre Look Like an Academy Award Winner,"Uh........................it was really that bad. Lion'sgate is known for their horrible direct to video flicks, cause it seems like if it's a horror title, they'll put it out..but this one's the worst. Bad acting from some otherwise decent actresses (unless bad acting was called for; then BRAVO!!!!). It's shot on video, which I personally think is a horrible way to shoot a movie; I wanna see a movie, not someone's home movie / afternoon spur of the moment idea to play with their video camera. The plot is insipid; and what gets me is why, if the killer is on the roof, why don't these girls run out of the house and away?? THEY'RE LIVING IN LOS ANGELES AND IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON.. Ugh, I'm not wasting anymore time reviewing this turd except to say that you've been warned..it's HORRIBLE.. Flush it!"
2,Lawn care & Gardening,"I found that the book gives a good deal of important information, BUT.. is a little out dated."
3,Out of Date and Old Style,"After Khalid, ALabina, and contemporary Saudi singers, Fairuz is boring and winey. I did not like it at all."
5,expect to become involved,"This book literally changed my perspective on the abortion issue. While there is never an easy choice for an unwanted or dangerous pregnancy, Harrison gives us a clear picture of what it would be like if there were no choice left to women who found themselves in one. This is no easy read, however, I believe every person in America, given our current political climate, should read this book. It is sometimes ugly, sometimes poingant, sometimes sad, sometimes beautiful, but always provacative. I can not recommend it highly enough."
3,"Great bibs, but 1/3 the price at TRU","These bibs are great to help catch the dribbles while my infant is feeding. However, they are available for only $6 from Toys R Us, so I am hesitant to pay three times the price on Amazon."
4,My Kids love it - I don't,"I don't know why they say it is self inflating because we really did need to add air to get the mat firm. It does hold the air very well. I weigh 300lbs and it works ok, but I am more inclined to sleep on a cot than a mat. My kids sleep on it and think it is great. I have no complaints - except they provide no way to tie the mat or give you a bag to hold it, you have to purchase it separately. Not sure of the logic on that - but you can easily find a low cost bag to hold it. it is very light and if you take the time you can really get it down to a very small size. we have tried other matts at half the cost and this was worth the extra money - so suck it up and buy it, but if your a big guy, get a cot instead."
5,wonderfull,"I bought the large one, I prefered instead the regular one in order to get few more inches of space for a few ounces weight, instead having problems when I go to sleep inside a Sleeping bag.I'ts very comfortable and it doesn't use a lot of space in your backpackThis helps you in cold night to keep you warm because your body is not in contact with the surface (Floor, concrete, tent) remember that when you go camping you don't have your bed and if you dont have a good insulation betwen your sleeping bag and the surface, you will freeze.Just one tip: Buy also the stuff sack or make some one with a piece of Nylon Fabric, it will help you to protect it when you travel."
4,Worth the Money if you love their music,So I got this cd because I couldn't find Wir schliessen uns ein anywhere and I really like this song. I also liked Der letzte Tag so of course I was going to get this cd plus Bill sang this again when his voice was more mature which is what I was looking for.Songs:1. Der letzte Tag2. Der letzte Tag (Grizzly Remix)3. Frei im freien Fall4. Wir schliessen uns ein song +the video
2,Cocaine addiction,This book is very treatment oriented. However there is some good information as to the addiction itself. Skimmed over alot of parts of it.
1,If you like drinking sand..,"I didn't experience any of the ""amazing results"" that this product bragged about. Not to mention that it's so gritty that swallowing it is like tyring to choke down dry toast.It tastes awful. The only benefit I see is the fiber content, but this method of delivery is nowhere near enjoyable. This stuff is awful, and not worth the 35 dollars that it cost. If you want fiber, eat some veggies or take a supplement. This stuff is NASTY!If I could give it zero stars, I would."
1,"Great in concept, Poor in execution","I bought this book because my wife spoke so highly of The Excellent Wife. I was sorely disappointed, though.It's not that I disagree with anything in the book, it's just way too generally and difficult to apply to life. It's like the author is trying to give an intro to theology, while giving a biblical model of masculinity.In the process, you get a very scattered, very shallow overview many things. None of them are deep enough to be useful though. There are better books."
2,Best left as a childhood memory,"I remember laughing at this show as a pre-teen. I always enjoyed Cosby's comedy album more than the Cosby Show and thought the ""Bill Cosby"" Show would be closer to his stand-up acts.Reviewing the shows now, I think I was laughing as a pre-teen because my older siblings were laughing.Jokes are slow in coming. Context is usually standard 60's fare (e.g., trying to get rid of an uninvited houseguest before his date arrives).There is nostalgic value in seeing familiar guest stars (e.g., Henry Fonda) closer to their prime. I also give it points for not having a laugh track. It makes the series merely slow, rather than annoying."
3,Stolen Angles?,"If you love Sean Hutson, you'll love this. If you've read plenty of Sean Hutson, you'll be used to his writting style and this one my make you grow tired of it. As usual Sean takes us on several journeys that, chapter by chapter, slowly get told, all to meet up at the end. Just as one gets suspencefull he leaves you dying to get past the next chapter to pick it back up. The only trouble is once you've got back to it you find, sometimes, it was not worth the wait. If you do this to many times when storytelling the reader doesn't believe you next time. All in all I enjoyed the book because of it's plot lines and the way Sean tells a story, but the end really does seem like it was written quickly so Sean could make it to a 2:30 kick-off at Anfield."
4,Pentax PCF II,"I bought these binoculars after studying reviews for a few weeks and for the price, I really can't complain! I'm using them primarily for astronomical purposes.PROS: Great price (I found prices ranging from about $250 down, and this was the best price I could find); solid construction; great optics.CONS: The focusing knob isn't the smoothest...requires a bit of pressure; the lens caps/case/strap that comes with the binos are a bit cheesy, especially the ocular lens ""shield"" (I'll probably search at some point for a better - tethered - set of aperture/ocular lens covers).They work gorgeously both during the day and for looking at the stars. I'd recommend a tripod adapter and a tripod for these if you're looking to study double stars/star clusters/etc, since you get about 1/2 magnitude brighter stars when the binos are stabilized. They do wiggle a bit."
4,I've got a question.,"I actually read traslated book and I liked it. First of all, the progress they made from material to thoughts, and second they invented the way to measure the specific level of thoughts!! Though I am getting some hard time experimenting, but it's kinda interesting and will be shocking if it's true.By the way, in the book, the author says we can measure the level of music and picture. so i wonder what are over 600 and what are below 200. I think measuring the level is another way of evaluating works. Body's evalution?I dont have any way to contact the author, so my apology to write here and would be happy if i got the way"
3,John;s good but crowd is annoying,i give this dvd a 3. why do girls have to high pitch Scream for no reason. i gave john a 5. joh nmayer sounded awsome for being so new.if john has another dvd or live cd they should tone down the crowd.
2,Great Product.... BUT!,"I almost never write reviews, but in this case I'm angry.The product itself is just fine, but the label on the top surface of the shovel (which you can see in the picture) is made of light colored plastic-coated paper, and when you try to remove it, it comes off only in tiny pieces. It's a nightmare to remove and leaves the glue from the label still stuck to the top of the shovel. So the shiny plastic surface which should normally clean easily will now be unsightly and unclean because of the remainder of the label with it's sticky glue that doesn't come off.If you buy this, be prepared for a few hours of effort just to get the label off!"
3,Why did they do this?,"Ok, how can it not work? It's a ""dustpan"" on a stick and a spade on a stick. The thing that just makes you wonder what were they thinking is the the product description, on the pan part, highlights the fact that the spade and the pan have IONPURE which is ""antimicrobial and helps prevent the spread of germs"". Sounds great doesn't it, until you realize this is printed on an adhesive-backed paper label firmly affixed, and covering 80% of, the base of the pan. This label is not one that peels off whole, it rips, tears, shreds all the time firly bonded (and covering up) the plastic pan base .... containg the IONPURE. In the words of Bill Engvall, here's your sign."
5,"Poop Out of the Dog, Poop into the Scoop","The quicker picker upper. I saw a friend bending over to scoop poop with a little shovel. LOL , use this."
1,Flimsy,"The dust pan part of this was cracked when I opened the package. It was not well-wrapped for shipping--just in a single layer of brown paper--so that may have been the problem, but the whole thing feels rather flimsy. I returned it for a refund and will look for a sturdier product."
2,Junk,"Though this player's stats look good on paper, and the concept is a great one, do not buy it. I recieved one for Christmas last year, and the headphone jack fell INTO the player after a few months. Lexar sent me a replacement, which did not even work to begin with. They sent me another one, the headphone jack broke on that one too. After this they refused to give me a refund, but replaced it with their newest model mp3 player, the LDP-600. I am waiting to see if their are any defects, but this is a much nicer player. In closing, stay away from the Jumpgear, I loved it while it worked, but it is far to poorly manufactured to warrant any price."
2,Does not remember where you left off like other MP3 players,"I am using this unit, but have to manually record which track I was last at when I shut it off. If I had known this before I bought this I would not have considered this unit. Lexar needs to fix this issue before this is a viable MP3 player."
2,A disappointing transfer makes for a dismal film experience!,"Columbia Pictures has regressed in their shoddy film transfers of catalogue titles with this DVD. The film, a great screwball adventure that pits a prison escapee (Cary Grant) against a stuffy law professor (Ronald Colman) is about as witty, charming and utterly engaging as one could hope for. Resident studio do-gooder, Jean Arthur is a treat as the woman whose love for the two men is brought to hilarious fruition. As a film, it's five stars all the way! But the DVD is a thoroughly miserable experience with excessive film grain, fine detail shimmering, aliasing problems and varying degrees of stock footage used in the transfer. The hi-def packaging is also deceptive. * Note: the phrasing ""remastered in hi-def"" means nothing unless the source elements have first been cleaned up. Let the buyer beware! Over all, a mediocre experience. Wait for Criterion to get their hands on it or Columbia to come to its senses and do a restoration."
3,"Didn't read for building architecture, but was still useful","I found this remaindered for only five bucks. I read it not as a building architect, but as someone interested in what other creative/engineering disciplines had to say about creative projects that I could apply to web projects.The authors needed a better editor, that's for sure. There's lots of awkward writing here, and the interviews with architects are virtually unreadable, rambling, and vague.Those involved in web or software consulting will find not a lot new here--have the issues of client relations and creative services marketing really not had this kind of treatment before?"
3,Good value for the money,"I acquired this stereo for my New York flat, at Amazon's price of $45 with free shipping. For that price, this stereo is an excellent value. Sound quality, though not high by comparison with more expensive models, is adequate, and basic features are sufficient for radio, cassette, and CD listening. It does not include an equalizer, high quality stereo sound, or other features to which many would be accustomed, and the value price undoubtedly is because it is obsolete by current technological standards.This would be an excellent choice for moderate usage."
3,the INCOMPLETE poetical works etc.,"The one song I had specifically wanted was not included - this edition is missing a few pages, such as 13-14, 17-18, 23-26, and so forth. There is a disclaimer in the front of the book, but if - as the written excuse states - the reprint is ""culturally important"", how come the complete version (available for viewing online) has everything listed in the table of contents (also printed in the book), but the book does not? Foul, I say! Foul! If the rest of the poems weren't so charming, I'd be giving it one star. And to be fair, there IS a disclaimer in this edition..."
2,I was disappointed,I was surprised to find the smaller size rolls in the package with half the number of sheets per roll than I usually buy. These can be found in any store for $8 a package.
1,Horrible Seller Product not as Described!,"I purchased this product. >:( Firstly it did not come with any attaching tools like implied. Second it was only 1 protector not 6X as listed. Thirdly when I contacted customer service they were like ""sorry its a listing error"" and pretty much ""screw you!"". I highly recommend finding another source for this product."
5,Scratch guard for my Motorola Q,This screen guard fit perfectly on my Motorola Q's screen and does not come off.
1,Unrealistic and full of useless truisms,"I had to buy this book for a class of mine and even though I bought a used copy for only about $5 I can never get back the time I wasted on actually reading it. This book is only for people who are easily impressed with meaningless managerial doublespeak. If you want a useful and practical book on task and project management get a copy of ""Getting Things Done"" by David Allen. He provides a much more concrete solution that acknowledges the realities of everyday working life."
5,Adobe CS3 purchase,The process was simple and the product came in a short period of time.Have had no problem with the product a good buy at a reasonable priceAdobe Photoshop CS3
3,"simply, it works",The Battery is a tight fit but it works well and holds strong. Being the cheapest I could find i've had no real problems
1,Exceedingly bad acting,"The story is passable, but the *acting* in this movie is exceedingly and painfully bad. I've seen better acting at a school play."
1,not very useful,"We took this book to Panama and it was mostly useless. It got to be the running joke that if the book recomended it, it was probably: not there anymore, or not very good."
2,Good guide...weak history,"I have traveled frequently within Latin America and am quite familiar with Panama. The guide is nicely put together and well organized, but I found it a bit superficial and opinionated, as the Florida reviewer said. In my experience, I enjoy much more a trip abroad when I know a little about the country's history. To understand Panama it is necessary to understand its role as a crossroads, the canal, and more recently the dictatorship years, which means Manuel Noriega, currently in jail in Miami afer the 1989 invasion ordered by Bush Sr."
4,Another great Penny Whistle book,"I have many of the Penny Whistle books, and this one is as charming as the others. There are plentiful ideas for fun Christmas-themed parties here, accompanied by--as ever--charming and whimsical illustrations and margin notes. This series never takes itself too seriously, which is part of what I'm drawn to. As usual, the book lists parties from younger ages all the way up to adult Christmas festivities, and the ideas (and recipes) are clearly explained. Lots of scope for imagination, and really fun."
1,The game sucked!,"I was very disappointed with the game. It was difficult to install, and not easy to use. I will probably just donate it, or throw it out!"
5,Frieland and Folt a Success,"Friedland and Folt are the Strunk and White of proposal writing. They have written a clear, concise guide to scientific proposal writing that captures the essence of the scientific enterprise."
4,Looks Cheap... Works Great!,Product looks like the china cheap metal that you see at flee markets. At any rate we have used them several times and they work great. Not to mention it was at a real good cost.
1,Don't do it!,"I bought a Deni sealer many years ago and once I actually started using it I've never ever been happy with it. As stated by others, it does not vacuum all the air out of the bag (no matter how long you give it to do so) and it's a pain to use it.I'm replacing it with a Foodsaver 2240. Enough said."
2,Vacum sealer Machine,In using the Deni fresh-lock unit with their bags I have found air had made its way into the bags. I tried it over and over same results. so much for vacuum sealing .
1,Deni 1331 Freshlock Vacuum Sealer - bad choice.,"The product didn't work as intended; the motor was running, but the pump did not suck the air. I had to return it. The seller was very accommodating with the refund and return though, so I am writing this off on a bad item entirely."
1,the machine is not power full to pull enough vacuum .,the freshlock vacuum sealer is nice machine but is not pulling good vacuum on food bag it leave oxigen inside those\food bag is not heavy duty machine this is my experience with freshlock machine.
5,Awesome book - highest possible recommendation,"You don't have to be a Delta to love this book. (I'm not even Black.) It is a gorgeous book, very warmly written, and filled with treasured recipes, most of which are prefaced by the contributor's description of why it is so special. Unlike community cookbooks, each recipe is both clear and complete. It seems expensive only until you've seen it. It is a sensational cookbook, and will quickly become one of the loveliest (if not THE most wonderful) in your collection. You can't help but love it."
5,"truly wassail, wassail!","ahh, yes, if you relish the old victorian christmas carols, here's the book for you! the accompanying artwork is gorgeous and carries one back to a simpler time. plus it makes a neat gift for those who just plain love to go caroling! enjoy"
4,Timeless: A National Parks Odyssey,"The music on this disc appears to be 'electronic' which isn't my favored type but, with the imaginative cinematography the music somehow just fits. Very enjoyable!"
4,"Stimulating theory of personality type, popularly written.","Based on her work as a hypnotherapist, Markova has extended the idea of three channels of communication -- auditory, visual, and kinesthetic -- by matching them to the conscious, subconscious, and unconscious mind, producing six personality types: A in the conscious, V in the sub, and K in the un, with permutations of those. Well-written, with many examples and anecdotes. Stimulating theory. This book is a rewrite of ""The Art of the Possible.&quot"
2,Not Unless You Really Have Too!,Dont Buy It !!!Video quality is good but the backdrop and lighting effects are way overrated!Concert is just ok thru out!
3,Hawking toll free support is pooh-pooh.,"This wireless extender never has never worked with my D-link router when the signal is WEP encrypted. It DOES work with an unencrypted signal just fine. In fact, it works just great. I called the toll free to see if I could get an answer for this and was put in a queue of 9. Waited about 20 minutes to have the answering machine tell me that if I'd leave a number they'd call back. I did. They didn't. My review is 5 for the extender if you don't require encryption, 0 for support for an average of 2.5, rounded up to three. Disappointing support from a high-tech company."
5,The Karminsky Experience continue to delight,"Like the steaming hot java the cover displays ""espresso"" espresso is a refreshing delight. There are so many fantastic gems on this CD, at the very least the dreamily gorgeous theme from ""The Girl From U.N.C.L.E."" by Teddy Randazzo, the epic ""Beginnings"" by Astrud Gilberto and ""Paramaribo (My Heart Skips a Beat)"" by Berry Lippman is like The Swingle Singers on waaaay too much coffee. ""Something Big"" by Burt Bacharach is wonderful, James Last even gets tribal with ""Happy Brasilia"" (all drums and voodoo, you get with your bad self Mr Last!). The Gimmicks are fabulous with both of their tracks - ""The Joker"" and ""Roda"" and, well there's just too much more, get this before it gets deleted!"
4,A 50 Cent fairytale-come-true: The American dream,"This is supposedly the life of rapper 50 Cent before he got famous. If you're a fan of his music you probably already know the story as it's been published a time or two. 50 Cent sounds a bit corny when he tells the story in the background and at times he even glorifies himself; ""I was always the first up. No matter how we partied I made sure my crew worked twice as hard.""It is a well-produced movie and delivers all the way with action, love, hate and the american dream. It also makes you smile at times when the ""crazy Colombians"" enter. All in all it's a good movie to watch. Only pro is; it might be his life, but we've seen it before."
5,stars,good condidtion very satisfied clean disk and shipped well good all around product mobie was a good life story and well played
5,The Bomb,"This Movie Is Off The Chain50 Did HIs Thang...I Recommend U Too SeeThis Movie, Honestly, If U Love 50 Cent, See This Movie... Get Rich Or Die Tryin' Seriously...."
5,Get Rich or Die Tryin',I thought this movie was a great hit and well worth the money. 50 Cent was great at acting out his life on camera. This movie was sad but always keeping you excited!!!!!
1,im getting nightmares!!!!!,"does this mean every rapper will put his/her life story on the big screen ?!?!?!?!?!? they will share with us how being a crimminal is very important when youre poor.dont bother getting an education.forget about laws,society and your fellow neighbor.FUNK DAT,GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN' son.go fer self,hurd?!?!?!?!?blast a cap on whoever gets in the,i mean tha,i mean DUH way,nah mean........git that/dat fat stack so you can A)help the neighborhood you ruined while growing up.....B)go to school,learn a trade for when times get tough again,or C)buy some spinners,ne'ah!!!!!!!!!!!.............sigh.the end is definitely near"
4,Alright,I ordered on a whim and the book was okay but nothing AMAZING my kids liked it okay I would say definately toddler range! HOWEVER FANNY'S DREAM by the same AUTHOR AWESOME MUST HAVE!!
5,My jet-skiing dog!,"This life jacket is great! It even has a handle on the back for pulling them out of the water!She loves it, & so do we! No worries when the dog falls off of the jet ski, just go back & get her."
3,Not as effective as expected,"I bought this toning system belt based on the review. After 3 weeks of using about 5 times per week at 85- 90 intensity for 60 - 80 minutes each time, I have seen little impact on my stomach size. I will continue to try it for another month."
1,very simple compering to what i had before,i had one like that in europe and i was fabulous and thats why i decided to buy this one. unfortunately i am very disapointed . my old one had 6 different tipes of exercises plus timing and volume and this one had only volume and timing but only one program and its not the one i used to do most with my old one. it also bothers me on higher volume in the middle . dont recomend it...for little more you can find a better one on european websites
1,Terrible!,"This book sucked! I expected to read about her adventures in phone sex, there was nothing pertaining to phone sex at all. Just her adventures with her husband and some other guy. One of the worst books I've ever read. A VERY VERY VERY misleading title for sure!"
1,Historically inaccurate and very disappointing,"The writing was absolutely terrible for this series. I found it to have very little respect for written history of WWII. The portrayal of the US Army was grossly disturbing. It's really a shame because I found the Women's Land Army movement incredibly fascinating and inspiring, but I feel like this show pays absolutely no tribute to them. I wish I never watched this, I am very disappointed by the BBC. It could have been really something.."
4,Another excellent series,"This was another excellent series portraying life during WWII in the English countryside. I totally enjoyed the episodes and rushed through them with total abandon. Thankfully, there is a follow up series, which I have ordered and expect to see soon (Land Girls 2). The acting was excellent, the scenery superb, and the historical setting seemed to be quite authentic. I was very glad that I had the opportunity to enjoy this series."
3,Enjoyable program,"I knew many children were shipped off to the countryside during the way but was unaware of the fact that British woman worked on the land. I found the program interesting and informative. Not as developed as Larkrise to Candleford or Downtown Abbey, but good, none the less."
2,Lame,"I have twin boys and they didn't find this interesting at all--and they love building toys. Maybe we'll revisit them again in the future but initial impression is this kit is lame. Plus, the manual image/print size is way too small."
5,Super Fun,These are so easy to build and so fun to play with. Follow the directions or build you own. Best part is they are guaranteed. If they break you can send them back. We love these things!
5,My grandson loves it!! Great Educational TOY!!,My grandson loves cars!! So I thought this would be a great educational as well as fun gift and it is!! He's already made several different designs with this toy set! Thanks you so much! It's wonderful!!
4,"Lots of fun, but no educational value","I bought this toy as a gift for my nephew and he was excited up until the point he started to assemble it. He needed his dad's help to assemble it because it was tricky and a little hard to snap together, but once he had it all done, he had fun racing it :-)). I would not recommend this toy if you are looking for something that has some educational value, but it is good value if you want a toy that will teach a kid the importance of patience and personal responsibility. In this age of instant gratification and games that are high on sensory overload, this is a nice, simple toy that will deliver hours of fun."
2,gourmet gift,"It was not at all what I thought it would be. It's only a cardboard box that has to be fold and held in position with more cardboard and plastic. If you want durability and quality, this is not it. But if you are using it for light paper and nothing heavy, it should work for you."
2,Read Carefully Before You Buy,"I thought I was getting a Mail Sorter with a Leather Like Cover, but the whole thing is made of Cardboard. I wasn't paying attention I guess to the discription: ""Stylish leather-like Print"". Which means the leather is photo printed on the Card Board Mail Sorter."
3,It's Meredith Kline - what can you say,"Necessary preconditions to enjoying this book:1) Be convinced of covenant theology.2) Have no problem reading an author who considers his thoughts so original that he constantly has to make up his own vocabulary in order to communicate them. I'm not joking. There are some authors that think putting in large words makes them sound more intelligent. Kline is in another category. Those who find the English language totally insufficient to communicate his thoughts, and thus leaving preachers and teachers the job of translating him into understandable English. Correction. . . translating him into English.Seriously, though, Meredith Kline's work will, as usual, make you think. He is a gifted and unique scholar. I just wish he would spend a little more time making himself clear."
5,Very satisfied,"I got the book very fast and it was in perfect condition. I bought it for my wife, she had read it years ago and wanted to read it again. We were afraid that no one would have it so we were exited that we could find it here and that the original book was too."
5,Wonderful!,"At first I didn't like the FG trilogy, but just recently I read it again and was spellbound! How could I miss this wonderful series?! I think it was her most original plot yet. Julian's a god! If Jenny don't want him, then I want him! LOL I liked THE CHASE better than THE HUNTER. THE KILL was the best one though!"
4,The Human Touch,"""The End of the Pier"" is my favorite of Martha Grimes' mysteries. Not as ""mysterious"" as the works named after pubs, this one has a relationship between a divorced mother and son, and a romance of the heroine with a married man, none of which is salacious or spectacular and both of which are touching. It's more like a novel without the self-pitying tone I've seen in some of Grimes' novels and though there is enough weirdness of character, there is more of a celebration of the heroine's own eccentricity, which I like. One can always use the laughs between Melrose Plant and his cohorts, and Richard Jury our emotionally damaged detective, which are the hallmark of most of Grimes' mysteries. But this small mystery, a moving little novel, successfully stands on its own."
2,Not really worth the moneyf,"I bought this at Michael's Craft Store, with a 40% off coupon, bringing it down to about $6.00.. and although it may look convenient, if you have ANY sewing skills whatsoever, I would HIGHLY recommend just sewing something by hand instead of spending the money on this handheld sewing machine. It's not worth the money or the hassle in trying to get it to work. It's really loud too, and takes 4 AA batteries, which makes it pretty klunky to hold."
1,All Assembly Required,"This item fell apart as soon as I started sewing with it, and it required glue to put it back together again. Once assembled, the motor went into some sort of overdrive and got really hot before it stopped working completely. Waste of money."
1,Useless Sewing Machine,"When this sewing machine arrived it was damaged beyond repair. Its previous owner had broken it and then made a mess of attempts to repair it. One plastic part had broken off completely and the previous owner's attempt to melt the part back into place just made a mess of that part. The two halves of the sewing machine body were not snug because the previous owner had overtightened the screws and stripped out the plastic. One screw was missing. The interior of the battery well was missing the bottom battery contact, which meant that no electricity could reach the electric motor of the machine. The outside of the machine was filthy when it arrived.I tossed the useless thing into the wastebasket. I bought a new Singer version at Kmart."
2,ASKED FOR HANDY STITCH RECIEVED SMART STICH,"I am unsure if their is even a difference in the two products;Smart stitch (what i received) & Handy stitch (what I ordered) but, I will tell you that the Smart Stitch does not stitch very well at all. There is not enough room between the needle & the ""bottom"" of the smart stitch to fit an article of clothing in to stitch. Once you find something to fit in between the needle, it will begin to sew (very loudly, as opposed to the Handy stitch that seemed very quiet on TV) & create a preferated line in the article of clothing. All in all, you get what you pay for, well actually not, you get the generic. Welcome to online shopping & Amazon."

2,Missing information,There was no note about the water damage to this book. Disappointed. Not up to the usual quality of used books through Amazon
4,A great way to save energy,"I recommend the Tulsi oven for anyone who is serious about saving energy. I've used it a number of times since I bought it 3 weeks ago and have not been disappointed. Probably the highlight has been fresh cherry pie. The oven cooked the crust perfectly (I used the side booster panels but not the hybrid electricity). I'm going to try a pizza and meatloaf soon. The hybrid feature is a great back-up to have, although I wish I knew at which temperature it supposedly kicks on. The clips that hold the oven shut when not in use are extremely cheap-looking and flimsy. I know it is a matter of time before they break. Tulsi could have dropped a few extra cents and installed clips that will last. Finally, the oven instructions were obviously written by a non-native English speaker and are a bit hard to understand at times.That aside, I'm thrilled to have the Tulsi solar oven. I think I'll use it more and more, especially as energy costs continue to spiral out of control."
5,Happy Cooking,"I'm very satisfied with my Tulsi-Hybrid solar oven. I have used mine just as a solar oven, on hybrid mode and just as an electric oven. Each and every time the food cooked was awesome tasting. Worth its price to me."
3,How I Liked This Book,"This book is about a girl named Toni Chessmore. She thought that she always had a perfect life. She had a best friend, who she loved and cared for dearly. Her parents had always gotten along very well or so she thought. Until one day, her dad had a heartattack. He had to go see a specialist. Toni had to go stay with her sister, Martine,in New York for a while. One day Martine told Toni a secret about their parents. She told Toni that her parents had not always been perfect...You will have to read the rest of the book to find out what happens. It is a very interesting book, so go read it today."
3,Interesting But There Are Better Documentaries,"There has been a increase recently in documentaries covering beauty pageants, particularly child beauty pageants. While this one is informative and gives a detailed history of how beauty pageants started it is not the best documenatary covering this subject. There isn't very much coverage about children's pageants but the film does give some interesting pieces of information about the adult pageants. One example is of a Universal pageants in which one of the Scandinavian contestants wore a risque gown which looked like leftover costume from the movie Showgirls. Unles you are a diehard pageant fan with a burning desire to become informed about the history of pageants, my advice would be to purchase one of the videos from the A&E channel or the recent HBO documentary entitled Living Dolls."
1,A Bad Deal,"Replacement Battery Cartridge for Back-ups Rs/xs 500-1000VA (RBC32)The replacement battery may have been fine, I don't know because I could not remove the old battery from the UPS case. As a result, I was stuck with a replacement battery I could not use (because I could not return it) and the defective battery made my UPS inoperable.If you need to replace the UPS battery, make certain you can remove the defective battery before you order a new one!"
2,BEWARE-NON-RETURNABLE,We ordered this battery for our backup. The battery is the same size as the one we are replacing but is horizonal instead of vertical so will not fit our unit. THIS ITEM IS NON-RETURNABLE.... which we did not notice in making our purchase.
3,Didn't last 2 months!!,"My original battery lasted for better than 4 years before my UPS started beeping every 6 hours or so and the red replace-battery light came on. I ordered this on July 26 and it's now September 14 and the UPS is telling me to replace the battery again. I'm not sure where to go from here.UPDATE: After thinking the battery was junk, I researched the issue on line and found that there is a calibration procedure to get everything sync'd back up. You basically fully charge the battery and then connect a 30% load and let the UPS completely run down until it shuts itself off. You then immediately plug it back up and allow it to charge fully. Once I did that, the UPS has been running of the battery pack for more than a month now. APC should be more forthcoming with this information since it seems to be a necessity."
1,Poor quality and performance,"I purchased this battery from amazon on June 9, 2010 and on Jan 9, 2012 it failed the self-test. It is made in Vietnam. The original APC battery lasted slightly over 6 years. Whereas this one has lasted 1.5 years."
3,Fine battery but you can't return it,"After I ordered this replacement battery, I decided that my prior battery backup wasn't sized properly and I needed a different model. When thi sreplacement battery arrived I was surprised to find that Amazin does not accept returns on batteries because they are considered hazardous materials when returned. I suppose I can understand; I just dont like being out the money with nothing to do but now dispose of a perfectly good battery in some landfill.Please publish a warning about returning batteries."
5,Athena Micra 6 Speaker System is perfect for our 52,"After reading a number of reviews, we decided to buy this home theatre speaker system for our large family room. I bought 14 gauge speaker wire from [...]. The sound is wonderful for our Direct TV HD shows and you can't beat the price. They are also very good looking speakers as the pictures on the web site doesn't do them justice.For listening to music, I perfer using my B & W speakers, as these speakers don't deliver the rich sound for listening to music in a large room. Again, if sitting on our reclining couch 12' away from the 52"" HDTV these Athena Micra speakers are wonderful."
2,"Original Artists, but Not Original Recordings","The product description didn't indicate that these were new recordings by the original artists rather than the original recordings. Some of these tracks sound better than others, but it was disappointing not have a compilation of the original recordings."
1,Wrong song(s),"Although this CD has several songs I like, it does not have the song that caused me to initiate the order."
1,"Just $49,99!!!","Gosh! $50 bucks for a former edition of a novice, 120 pages book! Isn't it too much?!I haven't read the gem, so that the one-star rating goes for the price..."
5,works great!!!,It worked perfectly. It can be used for an adult as well as a child and was very reasonably priced.
4,"Terrific, practical info., yet a little outdated","The book is a terrific guide for teachers traveling to Korea. I was employed through a recruiting agency so a small portion of the book was irrelevant. The only other complaint is the recommended books are hard to get a hold of. I have yet to find one that is still in-print. For a recent graduate with no teaching experience, and no teaching certificate, this book gave me some confidence and prepared me."
2,Book Overestimates the value of a foreign teacher,"I only read the first few pages of this book here in the ""search inside the book feature"" and was immediately turned off by their backwards currency conversions! The first error is at the bottom of page 5 where 5,000,000 won is said to equal 6,200$ (in reality 5 mill won is about 4,950$)...the errors continue all the way through page 6....some knowledgeable book...it does seem to be inspiring foreigners to be reaching higher in terms of salary though, which is great, but incorrect information is a huge turnoff! In reality, most people do NOT even get this much. Most people make about 2.2 million per month. Of course you can find MUCH better pay, but you've gotta DIG...perhaps this book tells you how to dig."
3,His new version is better.,"I got this because I was curious about Tim Burton's ""original"" Frankenweenie. It's cute, and I'm sure I would have liked it much more had I seen it when it originally came out. From a historical perspective, it's interesting. And I always enjoy seeing Shelley Duvall act. But the new animated version is much better."
5,A dog with nine lives,"This ""Frankenstein monster"" film by Tim Burton is a perfect model of compact and compelling storytelling; it brilliantly distills into thirty minutes what normally takes two hours. Frankenweenie is about love, acceptance, and redemption, and it's got a good moral. It's in black and white (which looks great!), it's funny, and, for younger children, even a little scary. Frankenweenie is my hero! (P.S. See if you can spot the clue that Frankenweenie has nine lives)"
1,My most upsetting and disappointing childhood video!,"Between my brother and I we are able to agree on one thing, Frankenweenie being the most disappointing film we have ever endured as children. Two boys looking forward to our once a week Fry's grocery store movie rental decided on this film to entertain us that evening. Can you imagine how we felt after 27 minutes of a black and white movie at the ages of 7 and 9, or there about. Here is two young boys mostly interested in aliens and other random violent movies and we get stuck with this. So after this raving and built frustration over the last, almost, 2 decades I have decided to purchase this movie and send it to my 23 year old younger brother. Hope he enjoys the randomness and love his older brother will always feel for him. Love you Devren."
3,A decent summer read,"This is a good book for a lazy summer day. I found the frienships between the main character, her friends and especially her dog to be the high point of the book. The friends prove to be comical, silly and show the true spirit of understanding and compassion. The author does an excellent job of showing how real a relationship between humans and their pets can be, if you are an animal lover you will identify with the main characters. The downside to this book was that it could drag on a bit and I felt about 50 pages could have been eliminated. There really is no great surprise or mystery, if you are looking for a suspense thriller ""who done it"", this is not the book for you. I would recommend for anyone looking for a light summer read!"
3,Good but could be better,"The DVD satisfies the very basic requirements of a DVD. There are 4 episodes per disc. You can select a show and scroll through chapters in each show.I had two problems with the DVD that I hope will be changed for upcoming versions. There is no way to select a specific chapter and there are no subtitles. I love and always use the subtitle feature on all of my DVDs! I live with my grandmother and if I turn up the volume to hear all of the dialogue, the action scenes are too loud.All in all, good but could be better."
5,Bring it on.... the rest of the seasons!,It's a shame that a really good series gets a short life but to tease with only one season available is even more so... awaiting the rest of the series on DVD.
2,Not for the faint of heart!,"The picture quality is mediocre at best.The camera setup for your LAN is ok, if you know how to operate your router and WEP settings.It still took me several tries and I know what I'm doing.Now to get it so you can monitor outside your LAN over the internet! Good Luck!First, most ISP use a dynamic IP system which means every so often your DSL/Cable modem IP address will change and you won't be able to get to your camera.OK, even afer I solved all of those problems, the connection to the camera goes up and down for no reason. At times I can't access the camera over the internet for no reason.Overall, this seems to be a rather unstable internet camera. Even over the LAN it drops the connection a lot, picture quality is sub-average and getting it to monitor over the internet is a graduate course in Internet networking.I don't know if all internet cameras suffer from these symptoms....but this one is a stinker."
2,camera bag,"The camera bag fits my camera perfectly. It is very well made. I was greatly disappointed in the fact that I could not get the zipper to budge a half inch to open the compartment for the battery and battery charger storage. Did not want to go through the hassle of sending it back, so I guess I will use it as is. Camera protection was my main concern. Will carry the batteries and charger seperately."
2,"Too small, comfort doesn't deliver",This bag is sold as a fit for the Kodak Z812-IS however the fit is extremely tight and beyond that I'm not a fan of the single clip connection (back of bag) to the strap. Had I been aware of this I wouldn't have purchased this bag. This single connection causes the bag to flop around more and not remain steady as you walk or move about.
2,"buy a bargain, get a bargin","My three sons and I are hard on watches that range from Casio to Seiko, Tag and Rolex. With construction projects, sports events, etc, we replace pins regularly. This product looked like a great opportunity to have pins on hand rather than buying them per watch crash.We tried them once, the first two came apart before we could get them into the watch, the next wouldn't fit, and when we did get two to fit, one broke the next day.Probably worth what we paid for them, just a poor decision. I would recommend buying fewer, higher quality pins."
5,Quickly recieved,"Considering that I ordered the battery only 4 days ago, I'm very pleased to have my UPS back in good shape so fast. Everything appears as it was advertised and I'm happy."
3,door stopper,This device keeps a porch door from slapping in the wind by clipping over the edge opposite the hinge. Suggest door be no thicker than about 1 inch or it may interfere with the operation. Works but not so great as another style I'd used before.
1,Violent and Awful,"I showed this to my preschooler thinking it would be like the specials we've come to love, but I watched in shock as Snoopy has a knock-down drag-out fight with Linus over his blanket, kicking and hitting each other, then a boxing match between Lucy and Snoopy for no apparent reason whereby they knock each other into oblivion. Then Snoopy is picked up as a stray by a girl who ties him to a rope and drags him around by the neck choking him. On top of all that is a very weak story, lots of crying by the Peanuts gang, and just really - nothing good to come from watching this at all. Thankfully, it was just a rental and we won't be bothering with it again."
2,Snoopy Snoopy yeah yeah yeah!,"Okay i was amazed about this movie i was sitting their with stuff to do for 80 minutes."" And i think they showed Snoopy too much it wasn't funny, oh and did i mention the songs i was singing ""Snoopy"" for the next 4 months then my brother started singing them and i didn't like because they only focused on the main characters what about ""Violet"" and ""Molly Volly"" (sorry not big peanuts fans) I'm sorry but it wasn't my taste of a movie."
4,a memorable flick,"I first saw this film when I was about 5. I thought it was so sad. I snuggled up to my mom while watching it. For years afterward, she would sometimes sing the theme song just to get a rise out of me. I would always tell her to stop singing it. I don't think she even realized how much it upset me. This film is well written and very charming, but I think kids should be atleast 7 before watching this film."
2,Mostly less impressive remixes,"Some of the songs have overlapping mixes - the end of one track may actually have the beginning of the next track. The best song on this CD is ""God Is a Girl"" by Groove Coverage, but it's like a shortened version of the extended mix, which is not as good as the radio mix found on Ultra Trance 2 (which even has the video). Actually, even the slowest paced version from the single is much better. The version on this CD just frustrates me. The next best song on this CD is a remix of Steve B's ""Dream About You."" It's essentially the original, with insertions of trance rhythms whenever Steve B stops singing. Overall, it just seems like songs in this collection of remixes is not as good as the original songs. I bought this CD because it was competitively priced, but these remixes just make me want to hear the originals, which defeats the point of having these remixes."
5,Maxine Sullivan in the 1950s,"The Baldwin Street Music label and Ted Takashi Ono have done it again. This is a collection of Maxine Sullivan's commercial recordings and air checks from the 1950s. Her work from this decade has never been collected in one place before and you have some superior jazz singing here from the ""Swinging Miss Loch Lomond"". This includes the finest version of ""Accentuate The Postive"" that this Sullivan fan has ever heard. You have a number of tunes that were not commercially recorded and it is a thrill to hear Maxine sing songs that you were not aware that she had ever sung. In other words; you get the contents of the album ""Maxine Sullvian 1956"" as well as air checks and rare singles. This is a must have for fans of Miss Maxine Sullivan and for fans of great jazz vocalists. By the way, Maxine's other 1950s album is already on CD. This one is called ""Maxine Sullivan and her Jazz-All Stars-A Tribute to Andy Razaf""."
2,sony cell tel failure,"I ORDERED THRU AMAZON, CELL TEL CAME FROM ?????IT STOPPED WORKING AFTER ABOUT 8 WEEKS,I CALLED ?????THEY SAID MORE THAN 30 DAYS THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING ANDI SHOULD CALL SONY, I CALLED SONY AFTER A COUPLE CALLSOF BULL THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT DO ANYTHING SO MAILIT TO THEM IN A FEW WEEKS THEY WILL TRY TO FIX IT, IF THEY CAN THEY WILL MAIL IT BACK. WHAT A JOKE OF ANEXPERIENCE !!!!!!!!!!!!! I WENT TO AT&T; AND BOUGHT A NEW DIFFERENT CELL PHONE."
5,A good advanced study guide,"Definitely not for the beginner! Each chapter has two parts: the first part is a discussion of some aspect of French culture, say the fashion industry. The second part of each chapter is an actual dialog related to the first subject, say a discussion in a department store. The dialogues are on the tape, and the speakers talk really fast. The book also has language notes and discussions of the usages, verb tenses, etc. which are very helpful. The only caveat is that the text is not translated and not all words are in the glossary in the back of the book. But overall, I would recommend this to someone who is ready for challenging French study."
4,99.3 V3,"This is another great cd in the line coming out from 99.3 in australia. Most of the song are up beat, house music. I had to give it a four star rate because V2 was better. Dont let that stop you from getting this though...its great."
3,dead bolt lock,"I received the two dead bolt locks and one was defective in the threads internal to the lock. I re-threaded it and it is ok. However both locks were keyed the same and that is not desirable. You must challenge the re-sellers each and every time you get one of these problems, or your name goes down with them."
4,Biltmore Since George Died,"This book is intriguing for those who enjoy nonfiction. It describes how Biltmore formed a business to keep from being sold and subdivided, what happened to the family members since George's death, and the relationship between Biltmore and the city of Asheville, among other things. It is extremely interesting if you would like to know more about the history of the estate and its families."
3,"Funny, but....","This was pretty good, but closer towards the end of the video. I have listened to better videos of him than this one; however, still good to have in your library for laughs."
4,Popularity Contest,"If one more person writing a review says, ""should have sang"" I will scream! ""Should have SUNG,"" folks. Awful grammar is alive and well.We all know AI is a popularity contest and the best never wins, but this was a good compilation of songs. I enjoyed everyone on this CD, except for Mikalah's awful rendition of ""God Bless The Child."""
5,The Best of the Best,"I have been working with computers professionally for 25 years, and this is quite simply the best how-to book I have ever read on a piece of software. iMovie 2 may be simple, but it has great depth, and this book shows you how to exploit every inch of it."
4,Getting to Know More about iMovie2,"The idea of this book and its title made me curious. I didn'tget it because I didn't know about filmmaking used in digital work.I wondered if it would bring information into my folder thatwould further benefit what I already know. It has; it has clarifiedfor me how Apple has made good use of its knowledge of its customersby allowing this outside contractor to create a book called ""...The MissingManual."" Thank you."
5,An easy to follow manual.,"Since I have started reading this book, I have been amazed by the changes in my body. I have only started the program and my chronic hip pain is already subsiding. The book doesn't waste time with long explanations and stories. Rather, it illustrates how an imbalanced posture can lead to stressed joints and back pain. I thought I understood what ""good posture"" was until I compared my own posture to her illustrations of bad posture. I am amazed that one slight adjustment can make such a difference. This book is by no means a replacement for medical care, but I highly recommend it as a manual for those who wish to discover more about the relationship between posture and chronic pain, and what they can do to correct it. Bonner provides a series of exercises that are easy to do and that don't require any special equipment. I think it is a ""must read"" for anyone who suffers from chronic back pain."
1,Amazon dimensions are WRONG!,"I bought two of these pans to use in my LARGE toaster oven. I do not have a full-size oven. I was delighted to think I could have a pretty twelve cup muffin pan that would fit in my toaster oven--NOT! The dimensions are TWELVE inches by TWELVE inches, NOT eleven inches by eleven inches as stated in the item description! Even the inside dimensions from the inside of one baking cup, accross the pan to the other side of the opposite baking cup is in excess of eleven inches. Pretty pan, but what a disappointment."
4,Great pan for a very good price,"I bought this pan to make mini rose-shaped pound cakes for a baby shower. It's a great buy! The cakes came out beautifully and this pan costs a fraction of what it sells for in the gourmet kitchen stores. Make sure you use ""Baker's Joy"" spray so that the cakes/muffins will not stick."
3,A tribute to Rita and Glenn,"Not exactly a film noir classic. It is mainly worth it for Rita and Glenn although their reteaming isn't as passionate as it was in Gilda. Glenn is good at playing a tough, yet vulnerable policeman as he is supported by his young wife incarnated by sexy Elke Sommer - the real 'femme fatale' is Rita who shines even in a less advantegeous role as this one -. Ricardo Montalban is good as a weak cop who falls into the Money Trap together with Glenn Ford. All in all, except for the actors and the soundtrack, not an unforgettable experience."
1,Not good,"I thought I was buying an adjustable lamp...it is not. I think it dangerous because it has the tendency to ""fall on its face"" placing the hot bulb in contact with desk surface....maybe paper. So I've had to screw it tight & remember never to leave it on unattended."
2,did not send me the right one,"the one I got is different from the one is shown here, which is not nice. But it was still D&G and the right size, so I did not return it."
2,"Brainlessly entertaining, but thin on all elements","Enjoy this movie for what it is, not what it attempts to be. Its a completely mindless movie about a quasi-military action in the Congo. On the positive, the production values are quite high. You will not be annoyed by the image quality, sound or other production issues. Where it lacks painfully is in any coherent plot; completely non-existent. Also, the film attempts a few dramatic scenes of emotions that just fails pathetically. However, if you can overlook those things, just sit back and enjoy a few kinda cool low-intensity battle scenes and Billy Zane. Don't expect oscar-worthy, but brain auto-pilot fun."
4,Bought for my husband,I do not watch this type of movie with him but he seems to enjoy them.It was shipped as scheduled and in good condition.I can not tell you anything about the movie.We would purchase from this seller again.
2,"Military Channel's ""Modern Sniper"" series outshines this Hollywood distortion","The only decent Hollywood production involving sniping that had a shred of credibility was ""Shooter"" with Mark Wahlberg, simply because the cast, crew and producer attended a REAL FIREARMS training institute, Front Sight. Even with that training, I still saw some daylight between Wahlberg's trigger finger and the trigger when he was doing semi-auto fire on one scene. Sniper: Reloaded paled by comparison. More on this later..."
1,Too farr feched,The book started out great but ended with the lack of literary skills of a good author.
5,The Sensation of Being Somebody,Excellent book! Would highly recommend it. Only wish I could find out more and more about this subject from the author.
3,"It seems to work, but had side effects with me","I have mixed feelings about this device. I used it for a month, and it did seem to be firming up my abdominal muscles. I was up to level 70 out of the 100 possible. Not to be indelicate about this subject, but I had to stop using the Slendertone because strangely it was affecting my intestinal activity. I stopped using it for a few days and the problems went away, but came back when I started using it again. I've never had a problem with constipation before, and I can only think that using the Slendertone was causing it. I imagine that other body parts near the waist are also receiving the electric charges along with the abs, and that was the effect on me. I returned it under their 30 day money back guarantee and they refunded my money. The instruction manual says that nobody knows the long term effects of using this device, and I decided I would have to just work my abs the old-fashioned way."
1,Did not work,"I bought this item based on the reviews here, but it did not deliver the promised results, I have now used it for about a month and haven't seen any results at all. I am not overweight or anything, just wanted to reduce the tummy, but disappointed with the product. It was a waste of money."
1,Stopped Working,"The item seemed to be working well the first few weeks, didn't use enough to see results but I was hopeful that in time I would. The item stopped working within the second month of owning the product, I had used it at most 14 times, and that's stretching it. Initially, it would turn on then turn off within 2 minutes,until it completely stopped turning on. I've changed the battery 3 times, when I insert a new battery in, the item will work for about 20 minutes then just turn off, and it will not turn on ever again until I replace the batteries again. I would recommend investing your money else where."
3,Not the original Christie story-Chimneys,"The original Christie story about the Secrets of Chimneys is so different from this version. Who makes the decision to make all these changes? Still, it was quite confusing & interesting, so worth the purchase."
4,Very detailed basic facts,"A very detailed documentary/show on the Korean War (1950-53). So detailed at times it got boring but I truly enjoyed the dates, locations and month by month play of the battles and actions. It's a basic briefing of the war and doesn't get very technical. Names, places, dates and actions are talked about but other than that, not much is discussed. Again, it is highly recommended if you know little or nothing about the Korean war."
4,I was 8 years old when the war end but I remembered it,"This was a good basic documentary that had a good narration. It includes maps to show you where the action was taking place. This all helps you keep track of which side of the 38th parallel line the battles take place. But, I find it lacked punch and generally did not excite me. Also, it should have expanded a little more on the fact the returning veterans were not treated as returning heroes but forgotten heroes."
3,Roma By Laura Biagotti For Men. Eau De Toi...,"1.0 This is my 3rd bottle of the same size.2.0 The 1st and 2nd bottle,I bought it from Frankfurt and UAE respectively. Among the 3 bottles, the best came from Frankfurt. It looks like the oil content is high.3.0 This 3rd bottle is just below ok. My wife and I like the scent that is why I reached this 3rd bottle.4.0 As to the lasting of the scent, it didn't last until the afternoon. The quality has deteriorated already.5.0 I will not buy this anymore unless I get it from France and Germany perfumery store either by myself or by a reliable person."
2,PASKESZ APPLE CHIPS,"I WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED WITH THESE APPLE CHIPS. I HAVE PURCHASED SENECA APPLE CHIPS IN THE PAST--I REALLY LOVED THEM. I THOUGHT THESE WOULD BE SIMILAR, BUT THEY ARE RATHER TASTELESS, THE CHIPS ARE TOO BIG, & THEY HAVE A MUSHY CONSISTENCY. I WOULD NOT BUY THEM AGAIN."
3,Watch out for the ugly design!,"The graphic that is on the outer label of the CD tower is also, very unfortunately, printed edge to edge on every single disc. So if you want to be able to write on a clean (ish) slate after you burn a disc-DON'T make this buy! If you want to have a creepy graphic of a men wearing a what appears to be a women's shirt with a weird smile and a woman wearing a mans shirt (seriously, the couple look like they were recently intimate) on all your CDs, then go for it! The quality is there, just not the aesthetics."
3,HARD TO FIND ITEM,"It took me forever to find this product. I even called Rolodex and they said the item is discontinued. So I found it on amazon.com, where else, huh? I ordered one through one of amazon.com vendors and it took a while to get it, but finally I received it and I'm happy to have it. It's a great product and I use it a lot!"
3,"Very good, though mijangos kills it with ""Macarena 2000"".","The cd has very solid remixes of spanish pop hits, but the Gerardo and Macarena tracks don't seem to fit here."
5,best dog shampoo!,"my dog has allergies to many thing and breaks out with rashes. This shampoo not only will calm his irritated skin, if used regularly (I bathe him once a week) will help to prevent outbreaks. Shampoo works great for my dog. Delivery was a little slow in getting this product, but I also did not place a rush on it."
5,The Best!,"My best soundtrack of all time. I have more than 8 soundtracks and this is the only one I play. I would say my favorites are #3 #5 #7 #11 #12 #1 and #18. Even though I listen to all of them, those songs are my favorites. It is also one of my newest cds that I have. I would recommend this CD to every kids that LIKED Spy Kids 3-D."
3,Colibri Clip Time Piece,"I'm the type who doesn't like to wear a wrist watch and who dresses casually almost always, so this works best for me. This piece is accurate and doesn't get in the way. Don't expect accuracy from the compass. For the price the piece is more than adequate."
4,evenflow chases deluxe booster seat,good booster seat.cup/snack holder and the arm rests fall off very easily.
4,Much Useful Information,"This is a good resource for model railroaders who like to personalize their rolling stock by super detailing. I like the book, but it could have been even better with more closeups of details and lettering. Nevertheless, it was a good value for the money from a trusted online seller."
2,Not the worst book out there.,"This is a decent book for anyone who knows very little about interdev. I liked the step-by-step tutorials, but they can get frustrating quickly. It's a good intro book, but halfway through it, you'll be looking for something better.The Author mentions that she owns the Enterprise Edition of Interdev. This is important because she has installed ALL the options and assumes the reader has done the same. If you are not using the Enterprise edition, have your own web server running on NT, and a ton of other packages, then this book will be fairly maddening."
3,Kids Yoga,"While this is a good video I was hoping that it would be more stretching than breathing exercises. It does have both but I would encourage people to find something that allowed the kids to do more moving. I do understand that the breathing is important but my kids (3,5,5,10) had a hard time staying focused when it came to the 'relaxation' section."
2,Too Fast,This video is too fast-paced to be an instructional video. My students and I found it very difficult to keep up with all the poses and transitions. The video quality is pretty poor and the audio is soooo dreadful. I now know to stay away from the Yoga Kids series.
5,A serious author,"The book brings a realistic view about shotokan's history, in special its evolution in USA. I would say: An excelent book written by a serious author."
4,SALMAN RUSHDIE REVISITED,Isn't it intriguing just how many rebels Indo-Anglian fiction is producing. I just hope the Hindu fundamentalist militia doesn't put a price on Vinay Iyer's head. This novel is breathtaking for the sheer force and brutality of its message presented in the most sensuous of writing. Awesome work!
3,Feels Great...BUT,Pen feels awesome but the one I received the ink was out...so first step was to find replacement cartridges...not too exciting to get a pen that doesn't have ink!UPDATE --- I contacted Seller and they are sending me a replacement cartridge!
4,impressive!,"Story of a beautiful journey through Africa, told in a plain and courageous way... What pushed Ffyona Campbell to walk more than 2 years ans the personal demons she faced... A story about being human."
3,Good Book Except She Lied about completing trips,"Ffyona is an confident, self absorbed, bordering on arrogant, adventurer and explorer. While it is much about her ordeals, its is at its best in giving an outsider a good idea of how to approach different cultures as in africa.Where the Ffyona fails is that she has a history of lying about her travels. She admitted lieing about accepting rided in her trip across America and many people believe that she accepted rides or failed to complete parts of her trip in the congo and central africa area.Still a worthy read excepting that caviot and her arrogance..."
3,Flimsy mountings,"Lost the main computer head on a ride tonight because of a few minor bumps. I like the functions other than an altimeter requiring constant recalibration. But the mountings are just really low quality. Lost the main computer tonight and now what do I do now with this after paying $120 plus?Update:I contacted Amazon about this problem and they immediately sent me a new replacement unit. Their customer service is OUTSTANDING. I will continue to use Amazon for many purchase in the future. Thanks Amazon.com!!!!However, I still think the mounting method for the transmitter and computer head piece should be enhanced because these thin wire ties that hold them seem very vulnerable to breakage. At least use a thicker wire tire VDO. These thin wire ties are risky for securing the relative costly components."
3,When problems heat up!,"When Zachary beaver came to town is a suspenseful story with a lot of conflict. Problems heat up when the world's fattest boy, Zachary, comes to town. It all starts with the rising action when a trailer in parked in a parking lot with a sign saying 2 dollars to see the world's fattest boy. Main characters Toby and Cal are excited because nothing cool happens in boring Antler, Texas.The climax is when Toby, Cal and Scarletts little sister go inside the trailer and Tara peas her pants. The falling action is when everybody finds out the truth about Zachary's weight. The Resolution is that Toby, Cal, and Zachary become friends.I enjoyed reading this book because I can relate to Zachary because people make fun of us about our weight. If you like high suspense stories, Then this book is for you."
4,When Zachary Beaver Came to Town,"I liked the novel ""When Zachary Beaver Came to Town"" for many reasons. One of witch is that its a story about two boys that live in a small town like the one I live in. Another reason I enjoyed it was that the author Kimberly Walis Holt did a very good job of discribing the characters. I disliked the way that she discribed the delivery of the worms.The best part of the book in my opinion was when Cal and Toby defended Zachary from the other kids. Ms. Holt had vivid imagry of the boys. In this part Cal had left food for Zachary on his front step and they waited to see if he would pick it up. While they were waiting some other boys came up and started picking on him. Toby and Cal did the reasonable thing and helped defend Zachary.The author had a good discription of the setting and talking about the characters. When she said, ""The cotton feilds look like waves"" I could imagine it. Toby and Cal remind me of two brothers that were always playing and rough-housing."
4,A decent fiction story that grabs your interest,"This story tells of many different people. A 642 pound boy arrives in the small town of Antler, Texas. Not many exciting things happen until Zackary Beaver (the 642 pound boy) comes to town. The story is told through Toby's eyes. I rate this book four stars because it is a good book for children. It also shows many different peoples."
4,Theres more to Zackary Beaver,"This took place at Antler, Texas. There was a boy named Toby Wilson, with his friend Cal. Toby's mother was in Nashville trying out for a contest for country music. Nothing much ever happened in Antler, Texas until today. There was a trailer that came from nowhere. People started to wonder why they were there for. So people started to crowded the trailer. In the trailer was an 15-year old boy named Zackary Beaver, which is also the fattest kid in the world. So they wanted to see want he looks like. They paid 2 dollars to see him. When they met him he was rude. Days past the trailer was still there. Later Toby and Cal were talking to Zackary. Then later they turned out being friends. They took him to the movies as friends. When Zackary had to leave Toby wanted to give him a gift. The gift was to get him baptize, since he never went to church, nor did get baptize. At the end Zackary left, with the best friends he ever had."
5,WONDERFUL!,"I loved this book! One of her most emotional and powerful single book to date! I cried at the end.(I don't cry easily either!) A must, must, must read! This is one story that I would LOVE to see a sequel to."
5,A step above,"I am not a professional, but it seems this is a truly excellent printer for graphics, photos. It is a bit slow on doing regular text, unless I haven't discovered the secret yet. I had a small glitch installing the driver on Windows ME, but it was easy to overcome. It is a long printer and I had to make a little more room on my desk after I took my HP Deskjet off to the dump. I've printed a bunch of photos off my Kodak Photo-CD's and the results is remarkable. I can easily see how my photography needs to improve. (...) The documentation is good, if not extensive. I would definitely recommend it."
1,Never got the product!,"I gave Amazon an address change but the product was sent to my old address and for some reason was not forwarded to me. They have sent me the product again and again was sent to my old address. I am unhappy as I needed this product for my work.Sincerely,Toni LaPorte"
4,"Educational Research: Quantitative, Qualitative, and Mixed Approaches, Research Edition, Second Edition",It is a usefull book for graduate students to use when writing their research proposal.
1,A Glittery Mess!,"My daughter got a few different princesses for Christmas. This is a nice doll itself, and my daughter likes it. BUT, there is SO much glitter on this she can't even play with it!! It falls off all over the rug, her clothes, her skin, and she had some get in her eyes! I suspect some of the tiny glitter could even be breathed in. What a mess! I really think that toys with glitter like this should be banned or recalled as it is unsafe."
3,Cult Disco Movie,"Well, this is and always will be the best cult disco movie, or perhaps the best documentary about disco, the atmosphere, style, culture and music from the days of dancing. It's more honest to disco than Saturday Night Fever but just as dull and campy as Can't Stop The Music later. It's a 'Love Boat' style movie with small and now outdated humoristic roles and stories for every player. Cult it is! See the clothing, music, disco interior! See the Queen of Disco herself (Donna Summer ofcourse!) just by singing her anthem 'Last Dance', lifting the movie to levels it will normally never reach. See the naivity of those days: fun for everybody.. and it will give good memories. It's a feelgood, sometimes funny film and is worth only to see those 5 minutes electrifying Donna Summer. For Donna fans (like me) a must have, for cult and disco lovers too. Futher not very special or overwhelming, or you want to dip in disco history again or see the Queen of Disco in action."
4,A cute little movie,"A very cute little movie. Purchased because I am a big Donna Summer fan. She really only has a co-star role here, but it is good."
4,A fun 'shake your groove thang' kind of flick!,"Definitely made to ride the extremely successful tailcoats of ""Saturday Night Fever"", this film captures the somewhat lighter side of the disco culture of the late '70s in its settings and story lines. This movie will show most Gen X-ers what mom and dad were doing on Friday and Saturday nights back in the day! Donna Summer is a must-see, too!"
5,Disco movies,"This is good disco, dance, and comedy movie. While I lke dance movies, but I don't really lke comedy, but this one isn't silly. The people have real problems and they find real solutions to them."
4,An easy read for those not in the public health field,"Ok..So, I HAD to read this for a graduate level elective course. For a political science student, I can say that this is a relatively easy read. Although, explanations of some of the international structures are almost farcical. The book progresses from ancient public health to contemporary which is quite interesting. With a caution, near the middle of the book some terms are not explained as easily, they are merely stated. This is a rather good book but if you are looking to understand American public health-you need an additional book. This book is very expensive, but at least it is filled with content."
4,Love this remote,I got the 10 device before the 8 device and must say I am impressed with both of them. It was programmed with ease. Learning of the remote is such a nice feature. I would recommend this to anyone that needs a good universal remote. Great thing is that it works with Dishnet as well as Directv . Having had Directv it was hard to find a universal remote that would work but this one did the job. The 8 device is much more comfortable in the hand then the 10 device which seemed a little big for comfort.
3,"it has been good..., but now no support?","I have been using this remote for over a year, and have been happy with it. Good flexibility, great price! Now I have just gotten a few new components in my home entertainment system, and so I need to get the new codes for those items. Those codes are nowhere to be found, and the support websites of the company are either badly out-dated or not working at all. They do not provide any support phone number at all, and their e-mail support seems to be down as well. Unless this is a temporary problem that they are fixing, this looks like a company that is going out of business. I advise: check for current support availability before buying from ""One For All""."
1,Doesn't work with anything I own,"I bought this remote based on all the rave reviews. I wish I knew how everyone else did it, because I couldn't get it to work with my tv, dvd player or cd changer. The manual refers you to the oneforall website if searching for codes is fruitless, but I could never get anything past the splash page to load. I'm pretty frustrated."
5,Takes a licking and still clicking,"The dog got it. Well, the title tells it all. Excellent product. A bit awkward to program, but it does work flawlessly."
4,Works well; functional,"positives: adequately controls all my devices (TV, DVD player, stereo, cable box, audio amp)instructions are clear; programming is not that hardability to assign new functions to different keys is greatnegatives: certain functions are not programmable, even with ""learn"" functionglow-in-the-dark or lights on the buttons when pressed (other than the power key) would be niceOverall, a good product at a good price. I do essentially use this remote alone, so it largely has done its job in replacing 5 remotes."
3,"Filters great, but very loud.","I bought this because I have had great success with the C-360 version of the filter. However I was not very pleased with this unit. The smaller version is very quiet, this thing is just loud. No amount of baffling in my cabinet could silence this beast. And yes, it is a beast. It is very large, and hard to move for cleaning or maintenance. Filters like a marine land though, very clean water. I ended up sending this one back and getting the smaller quieter c-360."
1,PharmacyChecker.com is a fake outfit!!!,"I went to PharmacyChecker.com and looked up a specific drug. I was given 4 on-line pharmacies to choose from. When I clicked on the Profile link below each company name I saw ALL of the companies have the same Pharmacy Manager or CEO name Amarjit Mann. Different store fronts, same company. So much for PharmacyChecker.com Its a fake!!! It doesn't compare apples to oranges. It compares apples to apples and there is only ONE apple and PharmacyChecker.com is it."
4,my struggle,This book is exceptionally well written. I find the book to be an anthem for a lot of young people going through their struggles to become adults. The author offers hope even when he feels he is in his darkest moments.
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen!!!,"HORRIBLE!! Run away! Don't waste 92min. of your life on this turd of a supposed horror movie! The acting is so bad, it makes porn movie acting look Academy Award quality! I am very forgiving when it comes to movies as well, but this is waay beyond forgiveness!! It just reeks of cheesiness, without being good at it, or relishing in it for entertainment's sake! What really sucks, is that the cinematography is very top notch -too bad it's wasted on such a terrible movie ...1/2 star for that. Also, another 1/2 star for the sound -it has a good mix that will make you jump out of your seat a few times. It's really too bad the nudity wasn't more gratuitous to give this movie more of a chance... just look what it did for Showgirls!"
1,Worst Movie Ever,"I was unfortunate enough to actually go to the theater to see this movie. Even more unfortunate, I picked the flick and saw it with a group of subordinates, with the idea of getting them out of the office for a while to have a little fun. This is by far the worst movie I have ever paid to see, and to be honest, I would pay someone not to watch it. The makers of this movie didn't seem to really know what it was supposed to be - horror, comedy, action. The horror was non-existent, the comedy was rotten. They even decided to throw in some ""matrix"" like moves. I can't even come up with the proper words to say to describe this thing. All I can really say is...don't waste your time."
2,Cabin fever,"Well,there were some parts that scared me and there were some parts that didnt. What was up with denis, the biting kid??? why was he screaming pancakes then doing karate?? Plus I really liked winston the police officer. he kicked ass, I like to party winston, and what was up with the that deer, kicking that guy in the face, that was totaly a dummy, I liked it alittle, but i really thought it was dumb, especially the sex senes!!!"
2,"Funny, Dumb, and Twisted","This movie was not scary at all, the first 20 min.of the movie was interesting but what came after was just pure laughter and flat out Dumb. It's a movie to see on a Monday night cause you have nothing else to do!"
5,Eli Roth Before HOSTEL,"Rider Strong (BOY MEETS WORLD), Jordan Ladd (BROKEN LIZARD'S CLUB DREAD), James DeBello (AMERICAN PIE), Joey Kern (SUPER TROOPERS) and Cerina Vincent (NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE) star as 5 college students visiting the woods. Eli Roth, who would later produce the remake of 2001 MANIACS starring Robert ""Freddy Krueger"" Englund and direct HOSTEL starring Jay Hernandez (FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS) made this cult horror classic. This movie contains great gore, comedy and actors. I give this movie a 5 out of 5 star rating."
1,this film sucked,"this film was so dumb, it was painful. Do yourself a favor, geta real horror film and stay away from this one. Try The Shininginstead. 1000 thumbs down."
1,BEWARE!!!!,"if i save one person from purchasing this turd,i will have done my part.this is a horrible excuse for a film.nothing wrong with wearing ones' influences on their sleeve,but some originality would be nice.i kept waiting for things to start picking up,and that never happened.really lame excuses for humor didn't help matters either.please,put your hard-earned money on a proven classic(such as evil dead,texas chainsaw...etc)or take a chance on some eurotrash if ya need something new(jess franco,rollin,fulci,etc..)"
3,Cabin Fever almost made it,"What's wrong with Cabin Fever? The biting kid, for starters. No point to that. Aside from that, Cabin Fever had genuine scares and was quite fresh in its approach to the horror genre. It was let down further though by the appalling acting, and the fact that we could care less about any of the dumbwits who got the flesh eating virus. Why should we sympathize with them after the appalling way they treat the man who came knocking on their door?Overall, Cabin Fever doesn't quite deliver."
1,dont bother at all,"this moive wasted hours of my life, it was not scary at all and the plot was terrible. don't waste your money on this moive it does not desirve it"
2,Not the Best,"This movie takes almost half of its entire time to get going. 45 minutes, approximately. It is good after that, but it shouldn't take that long. The concept of a flesh eating virus is new and original, but I was left to wonder how it originated. We see it in a dog in the very beginning, but how'd the dog get it? And what was the story with the 'Pancakes' kid? Don't watch the special feature of him doing martial arts to music in the background. It's time you won't get back. This movie left me with a lot of questions that were left unanswered."
3,3.4 out of 5,"This movie was alright, wasnt that good and wasnt that bad, but not one of these movies u want to buy but a rental is good, and I like the gross scenes but its still a pretty decent movie."
5,Desent one and two!!!,I bought this just bc it was cheaper this way than buying individually. The descent is one of the best horror movies ever!!! The tight spaces these girls crawl through are so creepy and the creatures....I have not met one person who did not like this movie!! The sequel is nice bc ull see a familiar face!! Cant say anymore!! Watch this movie!!!!! Its great!!
1,What the hell?,"This is honestly one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my entire life. Pretty much it goes like this--some kids who just got out of college go up to a cabin to have some fun. Upon getting there they meet a stranger (who one of them actually shoots) who has a disease, that makes you start coughing up blood and makes your skin just fall off. They all get it and start dying. Theres no real content or story line here...its just a big, hour and a half bloody mess. I think the scene where the little blonde kid with the mullet goes ""PANCAKES"" does a whole matrix sequence and eventually just bites the guy shows what kind of movie this is. I dont even know if this is supposed to be a horror movie--if it is, its not scary. Im not sure if this is supposed to me a comedy/parody--if it is, its not funny. Its just a dumbed down hollywood bloodbath, and there is not one redeeming quality about this entire movie. Dont even bother..."
2,What's the big deal?,"I don't know how this movie received so many raves since it's not such a big deal. A group of narcistic youths get exposed to a funky parasite/disease which makes them, like, melt. There's really no horror or suspense here. The only thing of entertainment value is how these shallow charactors deal with each other's demise. This is a 15 minute premise dragged out into a full fledged movie"
1,I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!! THAT'S WHY I GAVE IT 1 STAR!!!,"THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!! IT ROCKS SO MUCH THAT IT MAKES ME WANT TO GO OUT AND GET CABIN FEVER AND DIE!!! THIS MOVIE IS SOOOOOOOOOO AWESOME!!! THE ACTING IS AWESOME!!! THE BLOOD IS AWESOME!!! EVEN THE FACT THAT EVERYONE DIED WAS AWESOME!!! AW MAN, THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!!! YOU'RE AWESOME!!! WE'RE AWESOME!!! GOSH, MAY HAMSTER IS AWESOME!!! MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN I'M HIIIIIIIIIIIIGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Give me a break,"It's been a while since I don't come across with a such a stupid sequel of a decent film.Stupid plot, stupid characters, could be a mix of planet terror + the hills have eyes 2 + the worst parody you ever seen.Save your time, save your money."
1,Eli Roth is a hack,"Clever spoof? Scary Movie was a clever spoof. This piece of garbage is poorly scripted, poorly acted, etc....etc..... After seeing it I wanted to open my skull and scoop out any memory of it. Do yourself a favor, if you are thinking about buying this mess please DON'T reproduce. The world has enough stupid people. And by the way Amazon, how about adding a negative stars option to the rating system. It felt dirty having to give this crap even one star."
2,What can I say...Yuck!!!,"I say yuck because the people begin to melt. Overall can't say as I really lliked it. Too much gore for no good reason other than to have it. A good splasher film is fine if there's a reason for it, say as in Hostel. But here, I think they do it just for effect and that's the wrong reason.Now let's talk about the kid sitting on the bench at the corner store. Was he really neccesary. The only reason I can see having him in there was to create a situation where the kids in the cabin have locals with guns after them on top of being melted by the virus.Could skip this one and not have missed anything."
4,"Quirky, juicy, gory!","This quirky little independent thriller knocked'em dead at the Toronto Film Festival where it was grabbed by Lions Gate Films for distribution. Although not as innovative or brilliant as ""The Evil Dead""--which this movie pays homage to, along with ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""Night of the Dead""--it's still worth seeing. I watched this one after the horrifically bad ""Freddy vs. Jason"" and ""Wrong Turn""--both so badly conceived and executed that I fast forwarded them both. ""Cabin Fever"" starts with the obligatory group of young kids who go for a trip into the country for the weekend. The movie shows its first weird offbeat moment when one of the men is bitten on the hand by a strange, blonde-haired girl at a roadstop. This movie will never be famous for the groundbreaking brilliance of ""Evil Dead"" or ""Dawn of the living Dead"" or the other movies it reveres. But for a cool two hours, it's fun. Oh, by the way, the extras--for once--are worth seeing. Especially ""Pancakes""!"
3,"Not great Not Horrible, somewhere inbetween","This movie isnt great, it isnt bad either. Lots of blood, gore, bad government men, dismemberment and everything else you expect from this kind of movie. If you can watch it on Netflix please do. It is a good movie to watch at night when there isnt anything on 200 channels of cable, which happens quite often."
4,Don't look to deep into the movie,"Folks, plain and simple; this is a cheesy throwback style horror flick. And it is a very effective one. I have read to many negative reviews on this movie and I disagree. A horror movie is supposed to have people making stupid decisions and then die. And this one has plenty of that with some great gore. So if you are looking for some plot driven psychological masterpiece, then this is not for you. But, if you are looking for a story with a little plot, hot bodies, drugs, blood, and running around woods then this is it. Don't try to look deep into the movie, just enjoy it for what it is and nothing more. THIS IS A HORROR MOVIE DONE THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE!!!!"
5,How can you not like this movie?!,"This movie is the funniest, and most creativly gory movies, I've seen in a long, long, time! This movie has it all: boobs, funny jokes, a screwdriver to the ear, a swallowed harmonica, a guy fallig on a rotten infected corpse in a lake.....it goes on and on.But if you don't like this movie, buy the dvd any way simply for ""THE ROTTEN FRUIT"" episodes! It is the Best claymation I have ever seen, and it kicks South Park in the face!!!"
1,First movie ever destroyed by pancakes.,"Most of the movie was good but Cabin Fever destroyed its chance of being a good movie with an utterly horrible and ridiculous last half hour or so. It's unbelievable. I've never seen a movie go so quickly and unexpectedly downhill. It's just completely insane. I would advise everyone to turn it off before the last half hour and make up your own end, it would be infinitely preferably to the rubbish they actually made.I mean seriously. What was the director thinking. Stupid Pancakes kid and his karate moves. It makes me disgusted just writing about it."
5,Great Book & Great Author!,"This was a really great book. I loved how it had to do with this rock that fell to earth. Halley found it. Her one biggest wish in life was to be as beautiful as her sister who was model and she, Halley, was just a dull girl. When she found the ""loverock"" as she calls it, something told her to put it under her pillow and her wishes would come true, and that's just what happened. She became a knock-out. Well, I don't want to spoil this story for you. So buy this book. It's great, and you'll love it. It's a very good story and I've never read anything like this before. Also, if you want to get in touch with the Author, their e-mail address is in the back and they actually write to you personally. No form letters. If you want your book autographed, they will do that too. I had that done. Well, all I can say about this book is buy it today and don't delay!"
4,Be careful what you wish for......,Callie Bailey is used to living in her older sister Laurel's shadow. But it's not what she wants. She wants to be beautiful and popular. But most of all she wants Laurel's boyfriend Jake. Then one night Callie gets the LoveRock. That night she puts the LoveRock under her pillow and makes a wish. And then her wish comes true. Only problem is that in the course of this she almost loses two of the most important people in her life.This was a great book. Make sure to read the rest of the Mirror Image books!
3,The way north...,"The item came used of course and it really was used. But it looks just fine if I get to treat it with wood cleaner and treatment. Will do that when I get it to Thailand at the end of month. Functions just fine. Came without the center tray and azimuth handle but ordered handle and haven't decided whether or not I need a tray.There are none online that I can find. I paid about half of what it would have cost new, so I have to be appreciative. Should work fine but don't have the time yet to set up. Will do and have fun with it soon. Like everything that's TeleVue it really seems to take on a new meaning. Excellent all the way around. Would recommend."
1,Spooky.....,"When you think of Pantera, you most likely think of the Pantera we know and love (with Phil Anselmo, Vinnie Paul Abbott, etc). But somehow, somewhere, this strange yet eerie album crept into the search results for Pantera. Very creepy music indeed, especially track 4.Listen... If you dare...."
3,Not one I would recommend as a first book on Wicca.,"Some of the material sounds too much like just the authors personal preference and not was is generally excepted Wiccan practice. While there is certainly nothing wrong with this, I don't think it's a good starting off point for someone new to the Path who may not realize that what is in this book is not the ""way"" it is for everyone.However I did like the last section on setting up your house although I don't see how it relates to Wicca. Sounded more like Feng Shui."
1,Only for academics,"This book is very densely written and not terribly readable. It's really only for the most academic of readers, and not for the general reader looking to learn about this period of Korean history. It was difficult to keep my interest, and even harder to finish."
3,Red was dried up!,Opened it the day we were to use the coloring only to find that the red was all dried up inside the new and unopened package. No time to contact the seller since we needed it immediately (Christmas time) so I added a little warm water and managed to reconstitute enough to get our project done.
4,3DConnexion Space Pilot worth the $$$$,"The Space Pilot has been great so far. I've used it for about a month and it works really well with Rhino 3D. I was also pleasantly surprised when it worked automatically in our dimension 3D printer's software. Using it in Illustrator /Photoshop has been sluggish, but admittedly pointless as it's easier to move around the 2D space with keyboard shortcuts in my opinion. I had the basic 3Dconnexion Space Navigator prior to buying the space pilot. I would say the Navigator is not worth the $$ considering it only has 2 programmable keys and that's just not enough if you're using a professional CAD tool."
3,"Some highs, some lows","This compilation is a mish-mash, with highs and lows of Judy's singing. The liner notes are minimal, with no indication of when or where the songs were recorded. Many of the songs were recorded live, probably later in her career; several of the songs were recorded when she was young. Her versions of 'Moon River' and 'Fly Me to the Moon' are very touching and enjoyable.But some of the songs were recorded when she was not in good voice: in 'That's Entertainment' she is slurring words and not in step with the music; in 'Give My Regards to Broadway', her voice is breaking and squeeking on some words. There are two versions of her signature song, 'Over the Rainbow' -- both recorded live, both of them mediocre recordings.Still, the beauty and power of her singing comes through on 'Zing! Went the Strings of my Heart' (probably recorded in 1939), 'Get Happy', and 'You Made me Love You'."
2,bad wheels,"We bought only the stroller since our son was too old for the carrier. The stroller has so many wonderful features like the ease in folding the stroller, the net covering to shade and keep bugs away. I can go on and on. We thought the stroller was well worth the money. But it is essentially useless since the wheels fall off everytime I use the stroller. It makes it unsafe to have them detach, especially when it happens while in use! If they fix this problem, the stroller would be wonderful."
3,Match and match,"I very much agree with the previous review as I was going to note that here but found it already said. The paper quality is BAD. The design is printed on one side of thin paper so the ""white"" side isn't really white and forget about writing with a fountain pen or anything else other than ball-point for that matter, it'll probably bleed through.The design however, is kitschy and pretty. 70's and cool... I like that there's a corresponding envelope to each of the 4 designs of paper (unlike some other mix and match sets which never match at all). The colors and designs are what save this stationery set for me. I have to say, I liked it and I recommend it to give some variety to your usual stationery once in a while."
4,very easy and sharp,I needed a better pair of pruners. I had a pair that the handles had to open further than my hands could open just to get the blades to open up enough for pruning. These are way better and easier to manage. They are also light weight and have a more comfortable grip. I have to agree with another reviewer in that they don't work the same for left handed people. I thin it has something to do with the bottom handle that twists slightly when you squeeze the handles together.These are super sharp and one thing I like about them is that when your cutting a branch they don't jam up and you get the branch wedged sideways in-between the blades. Fiskars make great scissors and now i can say great pruners too.
3,Kinda Boring,"I bought three Jackie videos, some amazon special. Anyway they are a bit ""over produced"" for my liking. I swear the abs are painted on some of her personal trainers in the background. Sorry, I don't want abs that look like turtle shells myself. This specific dvd I found boring and a bit too easy for myself. I like a good challenge and to feel that I have really worked myself. Even when I do the exercises with 15 lb weights I still don't feel like I did much. I much prefer Jari Love!"
3,Wasnt Great....,"I have been impressed before with Jackie's dvds, however this one is ONE workout, not two like it seems. It was very awkward and tired my body out but not in a good way. I had weird back pains i had never experienced before. I do Jillian's dvds four or five times a week and will stick with those. This one was just blah."
4,@ss kicking workout!!,"This simply is a real butt kicker...(in a good way). If you're doing it properly within a few minutes you'll be moaning, groaning and really having to psyche yourself through it, no matter your fitness level. I use 5, 8, and 10# weights (she does have someone modifying w/no weights) combine with the ab section of herWorkout: One-On-One Training with Jackiedvd and am absolutely loving it. Would have given it five stars had it included a true, full-on abs workout.I do this dvd twice a week and break it up withJari Love: Get Extremely Ripped! 1000weights only option once a week. Really like both and find they compliment one another wonderfully. Along w healthy diet, lots of water and some intense cardio three times week...keeps me nicely lean and sculpted, but not bulky. Looove it!!:)"
4,Definitely feeling it!,"While Jillian Michaels' workout is just as effective, Jackie's personality is more seamless through the video. Jillian's voice and comments were distracting, but not Jackie's. I LOVE this workout. What I love most is getting a great workout in 30 minutes when I have no time to hit the gym. I highly recommend this video."
5,Intense!,"This is the first Jackie DVD I ever tried - and I could NOT keep up! I had to keep pausing, catching my breath and re-starting the DVD. She combines movements like squats with shoulders which works both body parts at once, and you get a resistance and cardio workout in one. For a short workout, it packs a lot of punch. Triceps are kind of ignored in this one though."
4,Worth the 30 Minutes!,I was pleasantly surprised with this workout. With only one 30 minute session I was hesitant thinking it would be too easy or short but Jackie kicks your butt and uses every minute of this workout to do so. I have her two previous DVDs and this one has much more intensity and would work well to compliment her power circuit training adding a little cardio to the mix.
5,Gaining an understanding,"Patti Henry's approach of addressing the female and male sides of this issue was ingenious. Her suggestions of how to deal with behaviour on both sides of the issue are reasonable and do-able. That each of us is responsible for our own behaviour and for the outcome of our lives is an important part of her book, but her telling us when to call it quits is even more important."
4,The Emotionally Unavailable Man,"Is very insightful and helpful in dealing with conflict in relationships between extremely emotional women and quiet, passive/aggressive men."
2,Not such a great book....,"Expected a lot more strategic information out of this book.The book does not have the 'exectuive level strategy' information that is expected from it.Also, it is highly focused on Supply instead of an enterprise wide distribution to all functions.I have read better Sales & Operations Planning books."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","I enjoyed reading this book and was dying from laughter most of the time. This book would have made a good blog-type commentary but falls a little short of being a ""must-have"" book for men who have been victims of radical feminism.While his anecdotes are very entertaining to read, his conclusions about politics, religion, and females in general are trite and unremarkable.As an avid reader of anti-feminism books, I give this one three out of five stars."
2,My husband was so dissapointed,"My husband spent a pretty penny on this watch, and he was so dissapointed when he recieved it. It was not what he expected and he didn't have it but one week, when one of the little hands in the watch fell off.The manufacturer gave him a hard time about it, and blamed my huband for breaking it. After a long debate, they said he could send it back and they would fix it. It took 6 weeks for them to repair it and send it back. The watch is over-priced."
5,"Worked perfect, easy to install","So easy to install. Two good screws into the wood stud and the rest was so easy. I put up a 32"" Sony and it slipped on easy. I found the instructions to be easy to follow. Very secure. Did not have any problems that were mentioned. No complaints."
3,I really want to like it,"The subject said it all. The spec looks good, exactly what I want. but after using it for a while, I'm not very enthusastic about it anymore. There is a bad pixel that not only shows up in the LCD screen but also in the pictures taken. decide to return it.Pro:1. 7x zoom2. compact and light weight3. capture movie in mpeg4, 7x optical zoom available in movie moodCon:1. image quality is awful with maximum zoom, image stabilization not working at all2. shutter speed and time between pictures is sort of slow (noticably comparing to casio Exilim model)3. audio muted while zooming during video modeI would recommend checking other vendor models. With this price there are better options."
5,Fabulous!,"Anothing winning entry in the Cass Shipton series! Ms. Riccio shows us a more in depth view of the Wiccan way of life in this novel, but the characters aren't whitewashed -- they struggle with dark thoughts the same as most people do, while always striving to embrace the light. I eagerly await the appearance of book 3 in 2005."
2,Okay.,"I absolutely LOVE the idea of this book, but it left me a bit disappointed. Out of 101 ideas, I only found four or five that I might want to try, which also may just be my personal taste. A couple things bothered me about the book. Some of the stuff just looked cheap and icky. Also, some of the ideas were repeated over and OVER throughout the book but on different items, like a tray a lamp a box, etc. It's all really the same idea, so why does it count for more than one? Just something that disappointed me."
4,"Repetitive, but good","Many of the projects in the book involve hot-gluing stuff to frames, but at least half of the projects are fun and innovative. Even if a particular project doesn't sound fun, there are many techniques and ideas that can be applied to your own projects! I used this book when making holiday gifts, and it was a very successful and wallet-friendly season. I heartily recommend!"
3,Good for personal spiritual growh,"I have all of Weem's newer books; so wanted to get this one. Was a little disappointed that it wasn't really poetry. However, it is a good book."
2,Disappointing,"Much, much time devoted to the political ins and out surrounding the US PT boat program inception. Disappointing lack of attention to the pluses and minuses of the two PT types and of their effectivenss in both the SW Pacific and the Philipines. Not a 'Buy' Recommendation in terms of general reading, but perhaps a fair reference for one wanting a place to start in writing a PT Boat Book."
3,good book on hooilgans,"as a reader of many hooligan books, this has been done well enough by cass pennant, it keeps u interested and concetrates on the violence and what these guys got up to. there is still a bit of the old, there was 700 of them and just 2 of us and we still gave em a slap, but not too much (woulda have got 4 stars if he left some of that out). the ICF are a very proud bunch, from reading other books they were a well respected firm in their time, he gives a good account."
2,"If you like LONG, DETAILED and BLOODY descriptions of war...","I picked this book up at our local library ... Man, oh man, what a disappointment! I read the whole book...it just about killed me to do it, but I kept thinking, it's got to get better. It didn't. It was filled with long tedious descriptions of fighting and weapons and war like mind set. Maybe someone who is a war buff or combat junkie would like this, but for your run of the mill Christian...it is just plain gore. And speaking of it being classified as ""Christian Fiction""...I really, really think that was a reach. There wasn't anything offensive in the book besides the violence, but it certainly didn't touch on any christianity. A couple of the characters mentioned their ""belief"" in God...that was about it.If you aren't into war themes, I would avoid this book. ... For those of you that like this type of fiction...enjoy the book!"
2,Water filtration unit,These shower filtration cartridges are great for about 3 or 4 days when they give out and a new one has to be inserted. At this rate they would be very expensive. They do however work while they are active and give the advertised results. I would not recommnd this product.
1,Waste of Paper,"This book has no redeeming qualities at all. Even looking at it as some sort of ""youth discovery"" book does nothing.The characters in this book lack any depth, and it feels like your walking throw a shallow puddle when looking for any plot.I honestly can't think of anything kind to say about this book at all other than at least I'm finished with it."
4,OK COLLECTION....JUST NOT PERFECT....,"After having waited a long time to get ""Law of Desire"" and ""Matador"" on DVD, I was delighted to find them included here. They're two of Almodovar's best films. And they look great. However, the others, with the exception of ""Live Flesh"" and ""Bad Education"", don't look as good. Particularly ""Women on the Verge"". As one reviewer said, it's botched pretty badly. The packaging is beautiful with nice xtras, but you have to be careful as the discs are stacked and could scratch easily. I wish they had been packaged separately. Also, ""Kika"" should have been included in this set (as it's out of release) to really round out the Almodovar experience. Well, just having ""Matador"" and ""Law of Desire"" makes it worth it for me. But Almodovar fans may be disappointed at the imperfections here. I was."
5,Absolutely fantastic.,"This book allows the reader to formulate his/her own opinion on each type of organization structure. Morgan brings in depth insights into the various forms of organizations through discussions of theories and examples. The book is concise and easy to understand, at the same it challenges readers by asking them to thoroughly exame each concept included in the book. Absolutely fantastic - a great leisure time book for the intelligent."
4,What an Image of Organisations,"The book covers, in depth, every topic needed to understand the complex nature of organisations and how they work.Each chapter is very well constructed and makes for easy reading, and the finding of information is made easy too.Excellent comparisons between different theorists and well referenced.Well worth a copy if studying for any Business discipline."
1,No printing capability - defective & cheap,I ordered this machine so I could 10-key several figures to get a printout with total. The trouble is the printer function does not work.I am returning it for refund because this is a cheapo item without common 10-key functions.
4,Calculator,this calculator was sent to me by mistake according to the company. I actually ordered a small calculator. They told me to keep the more expensive one for the same amount I paid for the small one. It is a nice calculator but was larger than I really wanted. The only problem I had was figuring out how to fit the roll of paper on it.
1,CASIO HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THIS!,PRO..... NICE PRICECON.....VERY BAD BAD BAD USER'S MANUAL/INSTRUCTIONS!CASIO HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THIS!THE USER'S MANUAL/INSTRUCTIONS THAT COMES WITH THIS MODEL UNIT WILL NOT HELP YOU AT ALL. IT DOES NOT GIVE YOU ANY HELP OR INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE OR PROGRAM ALL THE BUTTON ON THIS CALCULATOR. YOU MUST BE A PROFESSIONAL TO USE THIS UNIT. BEGINNERS LIKE MYSELF WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED UNLESS YOU CAN FIND A PROFESSIONAL TO TEACH HOW TO USE THIS UNIT TO IT FULLNESS. CASIO TECH SUPPORT COULD NOT EVEN HELP ME WHEN I CALLED THEM. THAT'S SAD.....LOL!SO NOW I MUST LOOK FOR A MORE SIMPLE BASIC PRINTING CALCULATOR WITH COMPLETE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS.CASIO REALLY BLEW IT HERE WITH THIS.
2,Just as expected,"This was not a very good value because I found out later that this was cheaper at Wal-Mart.........too bad I dint check before I bought it. Also, the box it wasn't packed very well, and the box it comes in was broken."
5,George Is More Flawless Than Ever!,This dvd brought back a plethora of memories. The sound and stage are awesome. Be prepared to get your party on and burn some calories!
3,"Great start, okay finish","I loved the first two books in the blue eyed son series, but the last book waasn't even half as good as the first two. The ending to this trilogy wasn't satisfying at all. I was very annoyed with the whole dog fighting thing. The fact that Mick would participate in such a moronic thing showed that he really had not grown and changed very much at all. I was disappointed in him after that. But I really do reccomend the trilogy because it's an inspiring story about a boy who manages to escape his upbringing."
2,Not Living Up To Its Brand,"I'll start out saying that when it works, it works very well. I run it to my Harman Kardon Receiver with sound and video quality that meet my expectations.Unfortunately I've been frustrated with weird pauses every other DVD or so. Usually just once during a movie. Of course it's not enough to make me go out to buy a different player, but enough that I won't buy a HK brand Blu-Ray player if one comes out. I'll say that these pauses don't require to me do anything, as the movie will resume after a couple of seconds; but, it's enough to be a little embarrassed when friends come over for a movie night.In conclusion, if you've found a killer deal on one or already own one, it's not the worst thing to happen. But, I'd look elsewhere if you have other choices."
1,NOT PING PONG BALLS,"These are the worst kind of ping pong balls (???) you'll ever use. I wonder why they call these ping pong balls when they are not. These are great for crafts but NOT for playing ping pong!!! DO NOT WASTE your money on these. I bought these to use with the ipong. So disappointed when the balls will not even go over the net. I thought the problem was with the ipong, fortunately, it was not. these does not bounce well too, like a ping pong ball should. Definitely get what you pay for. I'm seeing the price going down...I guess a lot of people are returning. don't be fooled by the picture, just because it looks like ping pong balls, does not mean it's ping pong balls."
2,"Okay balls, but not for serious players.","These balls are good for just practicing serves or hitting against a wall, but they were really bad for playing with. They bounce off at weird angles because of an outside seam and therefore does not really work for a game. You get what you pay for, and I would suggest getting better ones for a little bit more money if you are serious."
1,Plastic crap,"Does not bounce. Made a mistake paying 10 bucks, but that's what you get for the price, I guess... So, put it to trash and bought stigma, brand. No comparison at all!"
1,too soft,"These balls are too soft to be used. The shells are not of even thickness. Some places are very thin like paper. They can not be used in Ping Pong training, but they are good targets of BB guns."
1,Dissapointing Table Tennis Balls,My initial intent was to purchase them for practice.... they are good for nothing. We gave them to the cats to play with them.
2,Wrong Size,"My recent order of ping pong balls from you was wrong size. Standard size for ping pong balls is 1 1/2"" diameter. The order I received was 1 5/8"" diameter. This caused me to re-size my many ping pong ball guns that I had made prior to receiving this recent order causing a back-up in production. Time involved was about four hours. Time wasted when i could be producing more guns."
3,Practice balls means plastic balls,"Just thought you should know that the ball material is not the same as standard ping pong balls. They work, but are a slick plastic that is nothing like the material that traditional ping pong balls are made out of."
1,Not what you would expect,When you order ping pong balls this is not what you would expect. The balls are soft and not usable to play ping pong and are very cheaply made and some have holes in them
1,dont buy these,These are not ping pong balls or even so called practive PP balls . They are cheap plastic balls with a seam that casuese them to go all over the place.
2,For craft projects only,"These balls are only suited for craft projects. Mine arrived in a battered box just big enough to hold the balls. There was no packaging (not even a plastic bag) so not surprisingly many balls were dented or cracked. They are flimsy, lifeless, and smaller than regular ping pong balls (38mm instead of 40mm) so I wouldn't recommend them for sport. Fortunately I wasn't expecting anything better, so they will still work for my project."
1,Have not received,They said the product would be received by 11/13-15. Never got it. Asked to cancel and expect a refund.
3,works ok,"I got these for my 2003 mustang. the metal contacts in one of the connectors wont fit correctly, so i had to bend them a little (very little like 1mm displaced at the tip). once done it did fit in properly. better than cutting the wires and taping them."
2,Disappointed in the latest effort,"I am a big JR fan, his prior two CD's are in my car and in my home CD player at all times. I was really disappointed with this album, the songs lack strength and the ""hook"" that's such a part of his prior two recordings. I kept waiting for the songs to ""break out"" and get going, but they never did."
4,Buttler Creek Comfort Stretch Rifle Sling,I have carried my rifle for years with one of these slings. It seems buttler creek has tried to lower their cost with this new version. Very comfortable still. I wish it had metal buckles instead of plastic. I'm worried about the durability of it and years of abuse in the woods. I would buy it again.
2,Not too happy!!!,This would have been a great find had it been in english or atleast had engligh subtitles. Although you could follow what was going on pretty much with no direct communication to the film it really took away from it!
1,The Horrible USA Network season...,"This season was made by the USA Network. They were unable to procure the Airwolf helicopter after the show was canceled by Universal, so all of the Airwolf footage is recycled from seasons 1-3. While the acting is alright, this season is very poor quality. Also, despite the product details, Earnest Borgnine does not actually appear in this season. A stunt double was used for the scene where his character is killed. Because they couldn't hire the actors from the origional show, they had to re-cast the show with new characters."
1,Airwolf: Season 4 DVD,I was so disappointed when they cancelled Airwolf back in 1987 although it deserved it because the last season was not so good with a lack of the helicopter and more on the actors. When I heard USA was picking it up I was happy until I saw the first episode. I gave it a shot watching the rest of the episode and was thoroughly disappointed. Reasons have already been said by other reviews. I HIGHLY recommend you do not waste the money in buying this.
3,Embarrassment To Humanity!,"The case makes it look scary and gruesome, but they're cute little fairy tales. They're not ANYTHING like the case. They're for children. They're cute stories, but the case makes it look scary. Failure."
1,"VW Bug, the Skipper too...","Bad. That's the only way to say it. This movie is ""no-budget"" film making trying to make an effects extravaganza. And failing. The movie includes the infamous VW Bug as the giant bug, the ""hi-tech"" science lab which seems to be in high school biology classroom, untold shots of basically meaningless shadows and darkness, and the Skipper from Gilligan's Island as the ""comic relief"" -- read: spouting corny jokes. The film can be enjoyed two ways: (1) Enjoy the hokiness in the way B-movie can. (2) Watch the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version. The MST3K version is hilarious! This version features hilarious running commentary pointing such details as ""Lab provided by Mrs. Johnson's class,"" or ""'But, You can't see anything in this shot!' Be quiet film school grad! I'm the director, you just keep rolling!'"" Also there is a running gag about the mobs screaming ""Packers!"""
2,Only worked for a week,The seal is underwater. After a week it leaked and ruined the electronics. It was snugly closed and should not have leaked. I don't think the sealing surfaces are smooth enough.
1,Dont buy these globes,"I bought 2 of these globes....One of them never worked at all from day 1,,,,and the 2nd one worked decently and looked good in the pool at night until after a couple days it got water in it and it never worked again. And it must not have had much of a water proof seal because I had that sucker on there snug and secure and it still leaked!Save your money and avoid this product."
1,Already broke,I added this to my pond and within two weeks the solar panel had broken off the battery charger and was broken
2,Yuck,"I was so excited for this product and unfortunately, it's terrible. I tastes nothing like Italian dressing or even any kind of dressing."
1,NO!,"The flavor is straight up vinegar and chemicals. Honey dijon is my favorite salad dressing, but the Walden Farms Honey dijon is inedible, I almost threw up. I wanted so bad to accept this product, I did not have very high expectations before tasting, and it was gross."
5,Jones-ing for Kibble,"Ratherbee's catnip cigars are paws down the finest catnip toy on the market. Extremely potent, and very sturdy, they will last for months. I have two ancient ten month old editions under the coffee table now, and the cats still attack them with bunny kicks and sheer delight.The only drawback...and it's a little indelicate...after the cigar band is kicked off (which happens fairly quickly as it's paper) the cigar resembles a large, ahem, turd, and I've had guests do a double take upon seeing them lying about. If this potential alarms you, just purchase the Ratherbee nipsticks instead, which have the same potent catnip, and are fashioned with a lively printed fabric."
2,redundant much??,"This book says all it needs to say in the 1st 2 chapters, after that it's repeat, repeat, repeat! How many different ways can you say the SAME thing!!!?"
4,Inspiring lecture,I enjoyed a lot reading this book. it is a traditional but essential book to have for any architecture lover.
2,"Red is not blue, I was shipped the wrong color","The wires in the item photo are red. The item description says ""red"". Yet somehow I was shipped a set of BLUE wires. I was in a time crunch to finish my battery and starter motor wiring before shoving a new engine and trans into the car, so I didn't have time to mess around with waiting for the item to ship back and forth to make an exchange. Now I have blue wires instead of red, and I think it looks kinda weird for power wires to be blue. Not happy.The wires themselves are decent quality aluminum wire. They look nice even though they are the wrong color."
5,Great if you a foo fan,Good video if you are a fan of the Foo Fighters and want to learn the background story of the band.
5,Does it get any better than the Foo Fighters?,It really doesn't get any better than the Foo Fighters and this DVD will make any Foo fan super pleased. It's a GREAT DVD and it shows you even more how talented this band really is. I would definitely recommend this to any rock fan and obviously to any Foo fan!
5,ONe of the best!,This has got to be one of the best latin flamenco Cds i've heard!It's mellow and technically good. It has rhythm heart and soul.Check this one out if you're into any kind of latin flamenco music. you won't regret it.
4,Inspiration and education,"This book offers some wonderful inspiration. The author is very generous in sharing photographs, and does a nice job of sharing some techniques. Her work is fanciful, professional, and fun. This is a great source for clever design ideas - the author is a truly talented artist. The serious furniture painter will want an additional reference with more information on prep and finishing. This makes a nice addition to the craft painter's library."
2,More Girl than Spy,"This is the book for you if....you have often thought to yourself, ""Gosh, I wish that they had a young female private investigator as one of the characters on Sex in the City!"" If you've never said that to yourself you will find the book is a harmless but only mildly amusing memoir which offers significantly more about the romantic tribulations of a single girl in New York City than it does about working as an investigator."
3,Meg Mackintosh,This book is for my granddaughter for her birthday. she will be 10 yrs old in Aug. Looks like a book she will enjoy.
1,Don't be fooled,"I can't imagine how anyone could give these a positive review (well, maybe - check out one of the 5* reviewer's other reviews). The two 1* reviews are spot on, the noise cancelling feature is useless. I lost my Bose and purchased these at the last minute for a 4-week trip to Asia. After spending 40+ hours in the air it's very clear that these are almost completely ineffective. There is some small effect when turning the NC on and off, but I'd place it at substantially less less than .5db (i.e. not enough to make any difference)."
1,Don't waste your money,"This product was very disappointing. The noise cancellation is barely noticable, if at all. In a side-by-side comparison with my full-size Bose headset, this was a non-performer. I wanted a smaller set for travel but I absolutely would not use this again."
2,Mediocre sound cancellation,"The sound reduction seems to reduce about 20%. The earbuds have small rubber cups that fit into your ear canal. Unfortunately, the cups are only attached to the actual earbuds with a friction fit. You will lose them very easily ad the earbuds cannot be used without them. A few pairs come with the unit, but plan on trying to find replacements. I have lost four in the last year just by pulling the unit out of my pocket. They definitely are not good for running or other active tasks."
4,Powerful bass,"I liked the quality of the earphones and audio.I have not had the opportunity to test the noise canceling on flights.Unfortunately, the headphones are fixed on the drive and when I use just for music, I have totake everything."
3,These are just OK,"I like that these are small and that they have a nice carrying case. I expected more noise cancelling from these though. If you want a ton of noise cancelling, spend the money and get the Bose unit."
3,elementary level mostly,"These lessons are aimed more for the elementary level. Some seem a little old time-y, but overall can give you some ideas when lesson planning for ESL classes."
3,I learned some things but...,It's a good book for someone hand sewing with vegetable tanned hides. Since I machine sew scraps. I'm still looking for my leather book. After reading this book I may add small hand stitching details where becore I used chicago screws. Ofcourse seeing how others do something that you figured out on your own improves your work and gets your creative ideas going.I'm now more careful and thural in reading the reviews available on books Amazon lists.
5,Is it real charm or is it Memorex?,"A Dr. Phil program tipped me off to this amazingly well written and thoroughly researched book. We ladies are not the only one's with beguiling natures! Watch out! Learn. Become educated so you can protect yourself from these men who(God bless 'em)can lead you down a blind path using your heart strings for reins. Check out her other books. Everything I've received related to this author has been invaluable! Learn the difference between real and ""Memorex"" (pathological) charm that even he might not understand but has likely used all of his life!"
3,OK but...,"After all of the descriptions of dangerous men I was waiting for a chapter about the non-dangerous man and how to spot him. That chapter never came. It seems as if the author has described every guy out there as ""dangerous."" If you can't see anything wrong with him, THAT should set off the red flags because if you can't see it then you are dangerous to yourself!The thing that really made sense was the list of places to get a background check. Modern romance: ""Good news, darling, you've passed the background check so yes, I'll go to the theater with you!"""
4,Great Scent.......Wonder about the seller..,"I purchased this item, which states that it is Eau De Parfum, When I got the item, It stated it was Eau De Toilette. Seller did not respond.The scent is good, but, the EDP is much better."
5,"My cats love these ""licky pods""","We call them ""licky pods"" because the cats will lick these until they are sopping wet! But then all you have to do is let them dry and crunch them around and they are good to go for round 2, 3, 4....etc. They love these toys!! I've gotten them the larger version but they prefer these smaller pillows.My brother's cats love them, too! I give them as gifts to my cat friends year 'round."
3,Ok but not what I was looking for.,"I prefer very mild fragrance to none at all. This was very close, but still not to my very particular liking. Otherwise, it's a good soap!"
1,Dissapointing,"I bought the guide for Squaresoft's Kindom Hearts. I found it very useful, so I thought this guide would help me with Tony Hawk's 3. But now I think it was a waste of money, in each page there is very little information, the photographies are so small it's impossible to see anything, the maps of the levels are very low detailed.I have a 7 pages guide that appeared in an Spanish magazine which was better than this whole one.I recommend you better to use the money in Tony Hawk's 4."
5,Juno,My daughter LOVED this video. the thunder clouds caught her interest right away. I would recommend this to parents with infants.
5,A COMPLETE Unedited Collection of Episodes,"For interested parties, this DVD does not contain subtitles of any kind. On the other hand, it is in fact a fully unedited collection of the first 46 chapters in their entirety."
4,A book that breaks conventional green beliefs.,A highly informative book that grips your attention once you mange to overlook or get used to the distracting in-text citations.
4,One of the sturdiest large wheeled duffels you'll find,"I read the other reviews and would agree this bag is a bit big and cumbersome for air travel. But I use it to carry sports equipment around on a daily basis. This bag survived weather and heavy loading (40-80lbs) for almost 3 years. Most bags have zippers or wheels that break down on me within 2-4 months. Not this one. As far as I'm concerned, for every day local travel with heavier items, you are not going to find a better duffel. Tried more expensive bags from High Sierra and Ful, and there was no comparison as both bags resulted in broken zippers and wheels very quickly."
4,Watching mustangs,This is a great book for anyone wishing to adopt a mustang or view them in their natural habit as it has state by state guides on where to find them.My only negative is that all the photos of these beautiful animals are in black & white when the author specifically mentions colour variations in relation to the photos of the horses.
2,Big let down,"The rest of the serie was so great that, I think I expected a lot from this book. The other book, especially the four first were literally gluying me down, I never wanted to stop reading until I came up with the ""printed by...."" page at the end. Well, this one didn't have the same mesmeric effect.I found myself just dropping off the story, because it didn't seem to fit, somehow. The caracters seemed changed, and everything felt a bit rushed and done quickly. It still concluded the serie, but very quikly, locking everyone inside and all. All in all, I was very dissapointed in it."
2,Disappointed,"The previous 6 books in the series were pretty good, but it seems that the authors of the ""Death Gate Cycle"" got carried away and didn't know how to end the story. So, with ""The Seventh Gate"", the series went out with a whimper. Disappointing, given the fact that the series is seven books long. Seems similar to what is happening with Jordan's ""Wheel of Time"" series."
3,"Good book in a good series, but they don't fit together...","This is a great book. The Death Gate Cycle is a great series. However, there are too many gaps in the book so that they only way it fits is that it has the same characters. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it and recommend it, but Weis and Hickman should have put a little more work into it.The Series begins after years of Patryns trying to escape the Labrynith, taking over 20 years of Haplo's life and he was born in the middle of it, yet Haplo and the gang can go from the beginning to the end on in a day or 2?That was a huge let-down for me so I can't give this book more than 3 stars...Other than that it's great, and I loved the entire series and wish there were more, maybe a spin-off of Hugh the Hand's life prior to meeting Haplo.(My favorite character) It'd be great to learn more about the assassins"
3,Pictures can be decieving,"This is an excellent packable water resistant bag, but as another reviewer points out, the size is deceptive - given the photographs. Also, it may look like you are buying a set of 3 - given the photo - but you are not. This is a small sack that is perfect for packing the Therm-a-Rest mattress, or other odds and ends.So buy it with both eyes open"
1,Terrible prouduct - Not,This Eau De Toilette Spray is certainly not the product I wanted. It is old or a fake as it smells nothing like the original Calandre. I cannot use it or return it and I am stuck with junk. Very poor indeed. Not something I expected from Amazon.com.
2,Dissapointed,"I ordered 2 sets. 1 set I returned. The blades were loosethe hand guards were loose and the rack was broken, My brother kept theother set even tho the large blade was not straight."
5,My favorite book in the world!,"The book was great. Once I read the first chapter I couldn't put the book down. If you have not read this book , READ IT!!!!"
3,works,"nothing fancy, they work. they are a bit of a pain to install.if i were to buy again, i would pay a few more bucks."
2,Some nice photographs but little technical information.,"I was disappointed that this book never delved into the guts of photography- the film. Some of the pictures are beautiful and the editors offer type of camera and lens used but that's all the information there is. Nothing about lighting, posing, processing, etc. I was hoping for something more informative."
5,Glad I bought it!,"The Q-stor external USB floppy drive is a winner. There were several brands to choose from, and I'm glad I picked this one. It seems to be well-built, it has a rugged feel to it, and it looks good. It was very easy to set up on Windows XP. I used it quite a bit shortly after it arrived, and it works very well. I needed it mainly to install some old software on my new PC (which has no floppy drive), and will keep it in reserve for similar use in the future."
5,Selena at her best,This CD is definitely a collector's item for Selena fan's out there. It is great because it contains 5 number one singles on it. It is also very enjoyable and probably the most popular Selena CD on the market.
3,Amazing fast delivery,I ordered this book (by normal delivery) and received it after 4 working days in very good condition.Thank you for your service.Keep up the good work!
4,"Great photos, muscular prose.",OK. I'm biased--I'm Howard's assistant at Ostrander Hut. It's a great review of the history of skiing in Yosemite (ca 1930s +). Excellent color photos by the author.
2,bioethics by scientists?,"Most of the chapters in this book seem to be written by scientists, not academic philosophers or ethicists. So, unfortunately, they tend to not be very subtle, sophisticiated or carefully argued. I'd recommend something written by specialists in ethics, not scientists, to learn more about how to reasonably address some of the ethical issues that confront scientists. Almost any bioethics anthology edited by philosophers would do that.I borrowed this book from the libary mostly because I was interested in looking at the chapters on animal experimentation. With the exception of the very fine chapter by philosophy Ray Frey, the remaining chapters on this issue were not up to snuff."
5,All in one,This is best of the best of the best group in mexican music with a touch of different rhytms & styles this sure is a golden classic of classics. ;)
1,Not worth the money!,I purchased two of these gift sets for my 2 daughters as gifts and was upset to see the quality of the items when they arrived. I assumed that because they were Breyer brand (and $20 each) that the quality would be great. We have other Breyer horses and have been satisfied with them and thought these sets would be just as nice. The quality of the accessories is just not what I'd expect from Breyer. The doll and horse don't seem quite up to the standards we've seen in other Breyer products. [...]
1,No Ground,"The one in the picture has a ground (which is why I was willing to pay a little more for it [it isn't super cheap after shipping]), but the one I received does not have a ground - so I can't use this for what I needed it for. If you don't need a ground, I'm sure it works fine. Probably won't return it, kind of a hassle."
3,Riding Gloves,"Like the feel and fit of these gloves. They are all-weather gloves, sweat absorbing, light and comfortable. They fit snug on the hand."
4,Love the fountain!,Love this fountain! Got it from Amazon last summer and it works great and looks great and got it at a excellent price. If you're looking for an attractive fountain for your yard this is it.
2,Perhaps good for some; but I was disappointed,"I found ""Epic"" to be disappointing from the aspect of developing relationship with God; although the orator does give a nice background to God's plan and our setting in the span of things. There is a significant amount of story-telling about many other stories which I find it kept bringing me back to human events to explain Godly events. I would rather have had the reverse; God's events and purpose to enlarge human eventsand purpose. More of God; less of human."
4,Suspense plus spoof of the opera world!,"Robert Barnard once again mixes an intriguing mystery with gently satirical portrait of a budding Manchester opera company with its ""prime donne"", dictatorial director, even a ex-military stage-door keeper! Highly recommended for those who love (or hate) opera. Even the detective is knowledgeable on the subject. And Barnard works his plot in nicely with production of ""Rigoletto"" that the company is rehearsing."
2,Only so-so,"In this spoof of opera temperments, Barnard looks at the death of an obnoxious Aussie diva. _Death on the High C's_ may be more interesting to real opera buffs, but to me any mystery was watered down by the overdrawn characters and the rather obvious red herrings the author employs."
3,"It's ok, but the technical specifications? They say WHAT?",I've had one of these for years and it's ok for home use. But I glanced at the technical specs here and... What?Technical DetailsOptions: 21 Compartment literature sortThick polished aluminum for even heatingOven safe to 350 FNonstick coated - easy cleanup!Dishwasher safeLifetime Limited Warranty
4,Apple Tv,This one is going to take a little getting used to and not sure if we'll get rid of our movie package with our cable company. The movies take a bit to download so there isn't the instant gratification of putting a dvd in and playing it right away or putting the tv channel on Showtime or HBO. The movies that we bought and have downloaded seem to be in HD even though it doesn't tell you if they are in HD. We have downloaded all of our music cd's to the Apple TV and that is amazing! If you leave your TV on and press shuffle music it will show you who is playing and all of your music album covers circulate on the TV screen. Album cover art is so much more appreciated this way instead of cd's being stored in a box or on the shelf. Very impressed.
3,Not Quite There Yet,"Linking up to iTunes worked flawlessly. Syncing up to my computer(s) did not. I've had several technicians look at it but we keep getting partial solutions. I have a standard LinkSys WiFi and we've checked it out. Sometimes my computer will ""see"" the Apple TV network - other times not. I've tried it with 3 different laptops (one a MAC) all to no avail. So I'm disappointed that this product does not work as well other Apple products. I'm still an Apple fan - but ......"
1,Disappointed,"I'm a recent apple converted person (iPhone and MacBook) I decided to give the apple tv a try at a friends suggestion. I am a service member stationed in Japan so I can't access things like netflix. Further, there is compatability issue with my JVC TV in that the screen cycles on/off. It is a nuisance but I basically have to start the apple TV in the right port setting each time I want to watch it. If I switch the signal port and back I have to start all over (reset). Apple support says it's my TV. My TV support says it's apple... The saga continues. BTW all of my devices (bluray, xbox etc...) work just fine."
2,"hot, noisy and limited","my roku player is better in every respect except one: the apple tv fully downloads before playing, so you get a better picture if the roku can't get enough bandwidth. there are a lot of obvious features missing and the player can't be left plugged in as it's too hot and too loud to leave running. i'd recommend the roku over the apple tv by far. i rarely use my apple tv."
4,Nice little media player - better when modified,The AppleTV is nice little media player. Its functionality is further enhanced by installing a Broadcom Crystal HD card and software such as XBMC.
1,Two Apple TVs blew up on me and all content lost / not replaced by apple,"Two apple TVs have blown up on me and APLLE will not replace the content. They will replace the Apple TV but that's really no help as I've lost hundreds of dollars worth of content. Movies, TV shows, etc. all gone. Better just to buy the DVDs in the first place. You can back up onto discs, but this is a pain and time consuming."
5,A sure hit,"I thoroughly enjoyed this CD. Kevin has a wonderful vocal range, and a delightful sense of humor. The song choices were phenominal. This is must buy for any lover of Broadway and classic movie music. I can't wait for his next recording."
5,RIVETING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Excellent read!,"I JUST FINISHED THIS NOVEL. IT WAS EXHILARATING. The collection of short stories were all written interestingly and filled with deep compassion. I enjoyed this book and commend the author with a JOB WELL DONE. I am honored to know that some one speaks out on proud Black families that have accomplished goals in life basically because of parents that care, love and support. I just wish my family could have been included. For three generations, each of my maternal family members received their BA or BS degrees with most acquiring masters, PhD's, MD's, DDs's and JD's. I recommend this book to all present day parents who have children because a lot of parenting tips are offered."
4,I like Pictures,"The main reason I bought this book (other than I need to slow down on my meat consumption) is for the pictures. It shows me how my dish should look and inspires me to actually cook (which I like to do, but HATE cleaning up). The recipes are ok, not too many hard-to-find ingredients, but I would have liked to see more quick dishes."
3,Attractively presented but limited recipes,"This is a book with a good section explaining the various types of soy, how to select them and some beautiful pictures. However, I found some ingredients difficult to find and I was disappointed in the lack of recipes. If I had previewed this cookbook, I would not have chosen it as I have seen several which are superior in content."
3,Not For Practical Use,"If you are keen on entertaining your vegetarian friends, go for this book, but if you are looking for a handy helper for every day use, forget it. (Instead, reach for Deborah Madison.)THE NEW SOY COOKBOOK should be billed as gourmet fare; nothing wrong with same, but again, this one will not help the everyday family cook who is trying to add the benefits of soy to the family diet."
5,Wonderful¡,"It is an extremely practical book.You can take it anywhere,your job,your university.Having only two cassettes, the explanations given inside the book,together with with a little bit of effort, gives you a wide idea of the spoken language and the culture. The speech of the speaker is really clear.I recommend strongly this book,for its great usefulness and its price.Victor Bermudez"
5,"The book was excellent, you won't regret buying it.","This book was excellent,it makes you think hard about your friends,family, and the ones who love you. This book is deep, trust me you'll love it. Ann, baby you da bomb, keep up the good work,I looking forward to more books."
5,Spiritual Nourishment,"From FEEDING THE BODY, NOURISHING THE SOUL emerges a description of nutrition as a spiritual art. I found it to be a thought-provoking challenge of our current notions about health and nutrition. This is because it explores the crossroads of spirituality and food...a path to true nourishment. Drawing on sources as seemingly diverse as yogic nutrition, food and mood, Christian communion, and ancient Jewish and Native American dietary practices, as well as on her own extensive observation and research, the author restores our rightful relationship to food. This book has forever changed the way I eat and think about food."
4,Nice to hear something a little different.,"Let's face it- rock is pretty stagnant right now. I recently heard Spymob's Walking Under Green Leaves on the Dish Network NuJazz channel and liked the unique sound (which I would definitely not characterize as ""NuJazz""). Overall the sound comes across as fresh--so old it's new again. Its an eclectic blend of newer rock with elements ranging from 50s doo-wop to late 70s/early 80s pop rock (e.g., Steely Dan). The vocalist reminds me of Sting during his Police days, and adds interest to the album. The album is upbeat, major in key, and the lyrics whimsical. Overall, the album is enjoyable, and a welcome respite from the mainstream rock that's being produced today."
5,Worth every penny>,"Great advice on extending the harvest season, by using inexpensive, easily constructed cold frames and tunnels. I, for one, am planning on eating vegetables fresh from my zone 5b garden, all winter this year."
4,"Great Carafe, just hard to get the lid on straight","Good buy; it would get 5 stars except that it's tricky to get the lid on just right. But it's sturdy, keeps coffee HOT, easy to clean, and overall a great little carafe. I'd buy another."
3,"Ok, it's not her best","I agree with the other reviewers that the book ended too quickly. It is as if the book completely ran out of steam when Emma got booted out of Miami.However, as to believability, much, if not most, of this novel is highly autobiographical. Godwin herself started right out of college as a reporter at the Miami Herald and was subsequently exiled to the hinterlands where she must have been pretty unhappy because she got fired!As my topic title says, I don't think this was necessarily Godwin's best novel, but it was intriguing to read about the political climate of the day. And of course, her writing style comes through in the wonderful characterizations and descriptions. Even if I hadn't known about the similarity to Godwin's own life, I would have guessed that it is autobiographical in nature simply because she was so knowledgeable about the people and the politics of the time.I definitely would recommend it, but readers might want to wait for the paperback version."
5,A riveting story.,"I picked up this book not knowing exactly what to expect, and discovered a richly told story about a late-19th-century fire in Minnesota - and it is riveting. One of the things that make this such a rewarding book to read is the pop science seamlessly woven throughout - how fire works, how the sky over a forest fire can literally explode, how people burn to death, and much more. I loved it."
1,MFKR,"Okay, for the people who haven't been able to hear this CD, DONT BOTHER! This is the worst CD i have ever heard! I have all the other SK CD's, and the rule, but Paul and I think Mick (I could be wrong) are the only ones in this CD that stayed on for the later albums. The lead singer sucks, most of the band sucks, THIS is why they only made 666 copies! The fact that they decited to re-release it sickens me, THIS CD IS FOR COLLECTORS AND FREAKS ONLY!"
3,No repair facility,"After having this ladder for 3 1/2 years and using it very little I had a locking mechanism break. As I'm finding out now, apparently there isn't a repair facility. I was informed by Telesteps that I could send the ladder to them at my cost and they would sell me a new one at a reduced cost. They do not say what that price is. If I disagree with their price I would assume I would have to pay to get the ladder shipped back to me. With that in mind I'm not going to take a chance on shipping it to them. I'm dumbfounded they can't or won't repair this ladder. It's in like new condition. Tooltaker apparently doesn't sell them any longer.Unless this is resolved, I certainly would think twice about buying another Telesteps product."
2,A weird read,"I absolutely hate to give bad reviews, but from my viewpoint this story was awful. Maybe I was just repulsed by the whole storyline, or maybe I couldn't STAND the irritating drivel coming from these poor children's mouths, all I know is that the whole thing drove me nuts! Perhaps, that was the point! I think the author wanted to write something very different and engaging. As I can see, some reviewers loved the book. I found it draining and exasperating. For some great surrealism, read The Waves by Virginia Woolf or 100 Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez - fine writers."
1,Not THE Michael Kimball,I was very disappointed to learn that this authour is not the same Michael Kimball who wrote Undone and Mouth to Mouth though Amazon implies that it is. I wonder how many other authours who share the same name are presented as one in the same.
3,A great book!,"As a middle school bookclub, we highly recommend The Baboon King. while it is not action-packed, this book has much to offer. It teaches about different cultures, animal behavior, and is a wonderful story about a man who must wonder to ultimately fit in. Through our discussion the book gave us insight into ourselves and the society in which we live. Finally, its a beautifully written translation."
3,Not bad for a short read.,"Parts of this book were better than others. I think I liked the personal aspect of Ann Carl's life more than the adventures in flight. I just felt her book contained too many details and aeronautical jargon that would not hold a great deal of interest to those of us that have little or no knowledge of aviation. Having said that, though, I believe I will read some other books on these amazing and brave women known as theWASP'S."
2,Not again....,"There is no doubt that Altec Lansing makes very good ""sound quality"" for both speakers and headphones and I can clearly hear the difference when comparing to other headsets. However; this is my third headset and I am disappointed again with the low quality craftsmanship and assembly. By now I've learned to be extra careful in putting on and removing the headset and take care to not to jar or slam it around, even lightly, not to pull on the connector wires either, because everyday wear and tear takes its toll and they break essily if not careful. By break I mean stereo sound or mic ceases working. After just 4 months the mic stopped working, same as my other two sets. The volume wheel becomes ""staticy"" and cuts out after about 6 months and the plastic over the copper wires near the volume wheel slides out and away exposing raw wire and causing left or right side cutting out. For the price, I guess these are ""disposable"" with a product life cycle of less than a year."
4,A Good Effort,"""Lost In Space"" is a classic Aimee Mann album, but I feel that she's slightly beginning to lose her touch. As I read (in Rollingstone.com, I believe) before, ""Lost In Space"" just doesn't carry the clever lyrics as purported on her previous albums, ""Bachelor No. 2"" and ""Magnolia,"" etc. She is very talented and her music will take you on a journey of self-beration, depression, and introspection. Those who enjoy upbeat pop music may have trouble with this CD. ""Humpty Dumpty"" and ""Pavlov's Bell"" put some popular rock music to shame. ""Invisible Ink"" is reminiscent of a 60's ballad. ""It's Not"" ends ""Lost In Space"" with a theme that is found throughout the entire album: ""Life just isn't what I thought."" Graduating from Sarah McLachlan's poignant, provokative lyrics, Aimee Mann is certainly a pin to tease the balloon of the brain."
4,"Aimee Mann, Lost In Space","The song that closes Lost In Space, ""It's Not"", is like a punch to the gut. Stacked with beautiful imagery as we've come to expect from Aimee Mann, her observational songwriting becomes positively cinematic in this track. In fact, it's as good a reason as any to buy this remarkable release - and ""It's Not"" should end up on every cliche'd mixed tape of break-up songs. It's that good.None of the songs on Lost In Space are ""what if?"" or ""woulda/coulda/shoulda"" songs of lost love or regret so much as they're about the clarity that time can provide - even if you find yourself still in that doomed relationship you've been trying to escape for years (personal or professional).Compared to previous releases by Aimee Mann, Lost In Space is as finely crafted, if perhaps more mellow, and will likely age brilliantly.These are nightdriving songs."
1,Big Disappointment,"I can hardly express how disappointing this CD is to me. It is as if she was trying to revisit some of her finest songs, but fails miserably. The music is dreary, the rhythym seems to remain the same on all the cuts, and the words, while somewhat better than the music, are not up to her usual lofty standards. I have such admiration for her ability that it is really hard to write this about her. The songs all seemed to run together for me, and at first I thought I needed to give it another listen, but then I did, again and again, with the same result. I think there are 11 songs on this CD, but it is hard to count, because each one is indistinguishable from the last. I heartily recommend ""Whatever"" or ""I'm With Stupid"", these show what vast songwriting talent she possesses. ""Lost in Space"" is appropriately named."
2,overrated chicle chick,"A warm and delicate record, however these are very predictable and quite mediocre songs.Teenagers will like Aimee Mann singing about the ""big nothing"".They interpreted these songs like they were actually meaningful.Everything that Aimee Mann does is very easy to digest,and she sounds like a 500 singers/songwrites who did everything she is doing now and much more over the last 40 years."
5,yet another beautiful work by aimee mann,"I think aimee mann is one of the few gifted musicians out there. From the soundtrack of Magnolia onward she has been a steady pick in my playlists. simple, huh ?!"
5,More Genius from Aimee,"I've been an Aimee Mann listener since 'Whatever' was released, because this treasure of a singer/songwriter just keeps getting better. The overall sound/feel of the band on 'Lost in Space' is most like 'Bachelor No. 2', but with more complex layered instrumental stuff, as in some songs on 'Whatever'. (Think: string section, nice guitar arpeggios and embellishments, great vocal harmonies, and cool vintage keyboard usage). The lyrics, as we've come to expect from Aimee, are comfortingly melancholy. Her melodies are beautiful and infectious. It is my sincere wish that Aimee Mann continues to do exactly what she is doing for years to come."
1,Waste of money!,"I use an Epson Artisan 810 and the ink just smeared all over these. If it didn't cost so much to return this item, I would."
2,when political statements overtake a story,"Once more an interesting and potentially rewarding story is overwhelmed by the political agenda of the author. Sad, very sad. I had such high hopes for this group of characters and once more Tepper has disappointed me."
5,Exquisite Tweeter~Sweet Highs,"This tweeter produces excellent highs & detail! Planar's and Ribbon Tweeters on average produce much nicer/cleaner detail then many domes tweeters! They do have a very wide Horizontal dispersion and narrow Vertical dispersion, which elimenates interaction with ceiling and floor! Their sound field is very noticable and quite pleasing! Planars are very good for Home Theater applications as well as music! You really have to hear them to appreciate them! Their biggest drawback is their high crossover point! You want to keep them at 3000Hz or higher for best performance. You can go as low as 2500Hz if you use a 3rd order x-over, otherwise they can get rather ugly sounding This is why they can be unsuitable for many 2-way or mtm designs..."
5,"The tightwad ""Bible""",I have all three books and refer to them incessantly. Dacyczyn is creative and intellegent in her saving and writing styles and has a firm grip on how to live frugally and enjoy it. There is information on how a second income can actually break the bank and discussion on how her husband decided to stay home with their children while she published her newsletter. The Dacyczyns seem like hardworking people who really have their priorities straight.
4,these are so unusual,"I really enjoyed reading this 3 vol. set of books.I don't agree with ALL of the information and advice given in these books. I have tried many of the money and time saving devices listed. I use the home-made pizza dough and the home-made cream of soup all the time. This is like algebra, you just have to think in a different way. Good for the new wife or the big family."
5,Blondie ROCKS!!!,"To all of those gripers out there, I have a big screen 61"" TV and the quality and sound are EXCELLENT. If you are waiting for master prints, good luck. I am very pleased with both sets. For 5 bucks, these are masterpieces. Definitely a must have for any Blondie fan. Go out and get it!"
5,COOOOOOOOL!!!!!!,"This is one of the most AMAZING games ever!!!!!If you have a PC, GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!"
3,Stories from the godfather,"I am a John Mayall junkie and have listened to him since the early 70s. As far as I am concerned, he cannot do anything wrong. Mayall has so many great albums over the years that a good album like Stories, just doesn't meet the Mayall standard of excellence.In my opinion, the songs and music on Stories do not offer as much as several previous albums that I would rate higher. It's just an ""OK"" albumIt may be a good album for those who aren't that familiar with Mayall and just want a taste of his music or for those who like me, buy pretty much everything he does."
2,Died in 4 months,"Bought this at the end of February, and by June it would no longer hold a charge. The phone says ""low battery"" as soon as it's off the charger, and dies after a few minutes of talk time.2 stars because the battery did work fine for a few months..."
2,should have,this title should have been named the best cage matches of the wwe. most all of the matches were wwe matches. no memphis. no so-cal. and I think only 1 nwa match
1,Junk from China,Powerflow 6417 Pro-Fit Truck SplashguardThis item is nothing but junk and a waste of good money. It went on ok but on the first time I drove my truck the right one riped in half and the left one got caught on the tire and burned up...This is a no good product...Do not buy. I had to give a one because there was nothing lower really it should be a -5 stars.
2,Extended battery with shortfalls,"First the battery does not come with the charger. The battery charger cradle does not have a power supply. You must use the power supply for the Ipaq. This was a big disappointment as I was expecting a second power supply. Next the battery is big and with the new cover it greatly increases the thickness of teh Ipaq and makes the back a strange shape so it no longer sits flat on a table or keyboard.You can get similar of even larger capacity batteries for less cost. I bought this because I thought I was getting a second charger.On the positive, it has increased the operating time of my Ipaq significantly as the original battery did not have sufficient operating time to be of significant use when travelling."
5,Extended Battery,"Keeps my HP 3715 running for days. I generally use it in place of books. Even without turning the PDA off, kust letting the backlight dim out, I still get several days of usage. If I used the PDA for much more, I would probably loose some up time though. The only issue (and it's not really an issue for me) is that it changes the size of the PDA. It still fits the cradle just fine (good going HP) but hard case and such no longer fit. The seperate charger that comes with it is a bonus. No extra power supply to plug in (it taps into your existing cords) and it charges either the regular battery or the extended battery."
1,International Collector's Library book,I did not get the book advertised or pictured. I am collecting books published by International Collectors Library but that is not what I got. I was very disappointed and will not buy another book at Amazon.com because of this bait and switch tactic.
1,just get the zj drag link,worthless...billed as being better than the stock tj drag link end.... but it's actually just the same as the stock tj drag link end... which would have been 71.99 at pep boys with no cost for 3-5 day shipping to your local store. what a rip off.
3,"Attractive and dangly, but not as pretty as the picture.","My wife likes these earrings very much. That said, the picture depicts a much more vibrant shade of red than you will observe in person unless you're in direct sunlight."
4,Easy read and visual experience,This author demonstrates would appears to be real vignettes and discusses real events that is clearly understandable and gives meaning to the author's title of their book. This book is easy to read and can be read within a few hours. Having the person's personal statements and then the authors comments makes the connection of the individual's dysfunctionality and the dysfunction dynamics that makes their dilemma persist.
5,Great headset,"Pros:sound quality is greatmicrophone is good, with 3 settings, High, Low, and Mutevolume control.Cons:None really. Maybe a 9/10 for comfort.For the price you can't beat it."
2,Lasted 2 weeks,"They were awesome for 2 weeks... then they started streaking and after 5 weeks, I have to replace them. Should have lasted way longer for the price."
1,Horrible!,These have got to the absolute worst blades I have ever bought! The have streaked and chattered since day 1. I really expected more out of Bosch. Do not buy these...I bought some Valeo 900 for my other car and they are just so much better. I recently saw an article that Consumer reports actually like the Valeo 600 the best. These act like the rubber is just too hard with no flex and just plan don't work.
4,good fit,easy to install and fits well. installed on 2005 BMW X5 SUV. Seems better than OEM wiper blade on car.
4,PC,These wipers are easy to install and work very well. The even pressure across the blade is great and leaves no streaks.
1,Wrong Product,I ordered these based on the online application chart that comes up in the Automotive section and they were not even close to being able to fit a Saab 9-3. I was trying to save the dealer price tag but looks like to get the right product I am going to have to! Plus I have to pay shipping back. Where is the guarantee of product Amazon? Disappointed!!
1,Leaves Smear Marks,I purchased this item based upon excellent reviews. Unfortunately the wiper leaves a smear mark right in front of the driver's side windshield.
5,Wipes,"I wasn't sure about these wipers, but my car is of German heritage and many of the parts are Bosch. I took a chance and so far they work fine. They are quiet. The old one had an attachment to use the air current to hold the wiper against the windshield, so I didn't know if this would stay in contact with the windshield. No problem. It works."
3,"Good, but incomplete coverage","I have a VW Jetta III in Colorado, where there's lots of snow and magnesium chloride de-icer. The passenger side is clear, but the driver side doesn't make contact near the bottom of the stroke. Where the windshield is flatter, there's too much tension and the middle of the blade gets lifted off the glass. There about a 6""x6"" square of untouched water near the bottom of my windshield. That area is usually out of my field of vision, but the wind eventually blows the pooled water up."
4,Bosch Evolution Wipers,"Bosch Evolution All-Season Bracketless Wiper Blades do a great job of clearing the windshield of just about every drop of rain/water. After a couple months of use they continue to work very well and perform as advertised.They have pretty good tension against the windshield even though they are bracketless. I do find that around some ends that the wiper does not make full contact and some water escapes. Also, when driving at higher speeds or in high winds sometimes the blade can lift.Overall, I'm pretty pleased with the Evolution wipers. There are some minor issues, but they provide excellent coverage and clearing ability."
1,Doesn't work well for 2003 Honda Accord,"This wiper leaves a large unwiped patch on my windshield. (My car is a 2003 Honda Accord V6 sedan.) I've had this wiper for several months now, and it has always performed like this. It doesn't seem to matter what the temperature is, or how much it's raining, it always performs poorly. Cleaning it doesn't help, either."
3,Amazon tsk tsk,"Amazon said this would fit in my mazda protege, but it doesnt exactly snap on. I had to tape it using electrical tape as it wasn't a snug fit. But the wiper is pretty decent, its a good wiper but amazon it does not work with mazda proteges."
5,Great wipers,I've been using these on my truck for nearly a year now. No issues and I like them much better than most wipers I have ever used. They are particularly great with regards to getting ice off of them so they function properly. That is the problem with most wipers is that they build up ice in winter and it's difficult to get it off. The Evolutions are easy to get the ice off because they are one piece with no areas for the ice to get in and cause problems.
1,Not enough pressure,"From the very beginning, the wipers didn't clean a large area in the middle of the windshield of my 06 Honda Accord. I tried adjusting, wiping the blades clean, nothing helped. Now after 3 weeks of a moderate use (with car being in the garage every night) the left blade started squeaking. Perhaps I have gotten a lemon but I am surely not going to give these another look since I have to replace them after less then a month of use."
2,"Easy install, but streaks...","Had no problem installing the wipers on my 08 Lexus GS350AWD. They look and feel as if they were well made; however, upon first use there are several noticeable streaks of water left on the windshield every time. They do the job, but for about the same price I would recommend the Valeo's instead."
5,Bosch All Season Bracketless Wipers are worth the money,Installion of these wipers was much easier than traditional (bracket) wipers. These wipers leave no streaks and conform to the windshield as advertised. I recommend these wipers.
5,Fantastic and easy,Replaced my wiper blades with this bracketless blade and it works great and has lasted well. I highly recommend this product as a replacement to your car windshield wipers if your factory blades wear out.
5,Loving them so far! Love the Bosch Wipers!,"After having the Bosch ICONS for about 3 years. They finally started losing its function. I wanted to get another set of ICONS, but they were a bit pricey. So i went with the more cost effective EVOLUTION line up. And so far after about a week. (couple days of moderate rain) They work very well, and i am satisfied. I drive an Acura RSX so i bought a full set of 3 for under $40. Just cant beat the price and performance. I will be buying these again and recommending them to friends and family."
5,Best I've owned,"I've got to say, every year I buy a different set of blades hoping that THIS TIME they'll actually work. I live in Boston and clearing the snow and ice off my windshield is no easy task, but these actually work. The started to streak a couple months ago, but I did buy them about a year ago and you're supposed to replace them after 6 months so that's fair' I usually wait until fall because that's when I really need new ones. For the first time in my life I'm back to buy the same ones again. They're quiet, they don't streak and there's no buildup on the blades because they're frameless. I'm sold."
2,Disappointed with streakiness so soon,"Installed in winter, I bought due to the great reviews and am disappointed. The wipers were great for about one week during heavy snowfalls and conditions with a lot of salt spray in Wisconsin. But now it is raining about a week or two later and these things are streak central. One wee and these things should not be streaking yet. They clear the water very well but the streaks are distracting during night driving. I am going to write amazon for an exchange or refund. Be cautious to the great reviews."
1,"Warning: Does NOT fit 1/2"" Wiper Arms!",This blade is missing an adapter to accept the lager 1/2inch wiper arms of 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited. (It is the type of wiper arm in which the end is bent like a hook.) I later confirmed the problem at the local autoparts store. The Bosch data sheet is incorrect.I haven't experienced any problems with these blades on my car. Seems like a good blade... if only it fit.
2,Already Failing,"I put these blades on a 2001 BMW 325i Wagon. I live in Southern California where it rains only rarely and when it does, it is not very heavy. The blades started out great. Smooth and silky and quiet. But less than 1 year later, the driver's side blade has already torn and about a 6 inch part of the blade is flopping around. The passenger blade is fine, however definitely not as smooth. I park indoors in the evenings and my car is parked outdoors from 9AM until 5PM, in the shade usually. Even with harsh conditions though, I would expect these expensive blades to NOT TEAR. I am surprised at BOSCH for this low quality and will replace with another brand. Will also replace the wife's BMW blades with a different brand. Unfortunate."
3,Rubber is good. Plastic connection is cheap and breaks easily.,"The wiper blade itself performs as advertised, and does a nice job of wiping the windshield and maintaining contact across the entire length of the blade. However, I went to lift the blade off my windshield to scrape some snow from underneath it. I grasped it by the plastic that connects the blade to the windshield wiper arm, and it broke like a brittle toothpick. The blade wasn't frozen to the windshield, and I didn't force it by any means. It just broke with hardly any force applied to it, plain and simple. I will probably not order these blades again. For $15 a blade, they need to be of higher quality than that."
1,Poor Fit !!!,"They sent a little Two prong bracket with one of these but not with the 16 in one I ordered . Anyway, the prongs would not fit so the wipers are a little loose. Ill just go to Walmart next time and get the Rain x ones. Wish I had my money back"
2,These skipped just like the old ones.,I replaced my old wiper blades after about a year when they started skipping over the windshield. These evolution blades started skipping right out of the box. They make an awful racket. I waited too long to return them so they are bound for the trash. I won't get wiper blades from amazon.com again.
3,Was hoping for more.,As these are not cheap wiper blades I was hoping for more. Wile they where easy to install they streaked from the very beginning. I contacted Bosch and was advised that they had probably stayed on the shelve to long and to try contacting Amazon for a replacement. Amazon shipped out the replacement but I didn't have any better luck. I have since returned these and have purchased a pair of Rain-X wiper blades which I'll review on the appropriate page.
1,Not what I expect from Bosch Evolution Series,"I ordered several of these and have owned several Bosch Evolutions but both of these have huge lines in the middle. I have tried cleaning them and made sure the windshield is spotless, but in the rain I have lines in the wipe pattern. I have purchased Bosch Evolutions before, and have never had this issue in the time this happened. I bought them in October and put them on in late November... We have not even had ice yet, so why would this happen?"
4,Easy to install,Easy to install. so far so good. Holding back one star. Will see how they hold up with the time.
1,Seems high quality,"I bought these wiper blades for my 2003 Tahoe. They came nicely packaged, looked like good quality and were easy to install. After a few rainy weeks in Oregon they are leaving streaks on the windshield. I've cleaned them and they are still leaving streaks. I don't recommended this product."
4,Whisper QUIET,Little bit pricey...but the quietness of the blades and how well they remove water from the window was worth it.
1,Not good on my X5,"I have a 2001 X5 and these blades are listed as correct for that model. However the wiping is terrible. They leave streaks and often skip the area directly in the drivers vision. There is also a noticable sound as the wipers ""flop"" from right to left. they just seem totally wrong for my car. Like i said they do fit and are designed for my car they just seem poorly designed...."
2,They wear out too quickly,"These blades worked well for a couple of months and now they streak badly. Do not waste your money on these, they dont last."
1,good for only 2 months,"Installed them in November and was pleased: good wiping, little ice build-up. By January both blades were streaking. By February they were poor, very poor. This was a bad purchase and would stay away from Bosch blades."
3,Three Season,"I purchased these in the spring and they are great. Quiet and worked well. Living in the Buffalo, NY area, it was only a matter of time that they would get tested in winter conditions. The storm yesterday was a perfect test. They immediately froze up and created an uncleared area in the center of my vision. At each traffic light that was red, I would wait until the wiper was up, turn the car off and reach out and bang the blade to clear the ice. It was back to not seeing within 3 minutes. Once I actually had to use an ice scraper to scrape the ice off the blade. I'm going back to traditional winter blades and will use these again in the spring."
1,"Leaves streaks, quickly accumulates snow & ice","I just got back from a ski trip and drove through a snow storm. These wipers made the drive very dangerous as they would accumulate snow and ice and become totally ineffective. It was so bad that I had to pull over every 10 mins to shake the accumulation off. After I got down from the mountain and the snow turned into rain, the wipers left a nice blurry streak with each wipe, which took about a second to clear out. These wipers were the largest contributing factor to making my drive unsafe."
5,Love these wiper blades!,I like the way these wiper blades look and I love they way they work! Great product!
1,Parts missing !,"Wiper part was missing , wiper was wiggly and moves with high wind. I would not recommend these to anyone !!"
1,DO NOT BUY THESE WIPERS!!!,"I have them for few months only, and each of them leaves like 10 thin water lines behind. I cleaned my windshield thoroughly, thinking there might be some hard residues on the glass, but nothing changed. I will never EVER buy these wipers again!"
1,Terrible Wiper Blades,"I previously reviewed these as serviceable wipers, but they are bad. They lasted half as long as my old Bosch Icons. They hop, streak, squeak...horrible. and that all started about 3 months after I installed them. Less than a year out of these pieces of junk, with no bad winter either."
4,cool flight patterns,"This little plane does some real cool tricks all on its own. by throwing it down toward the ground, it then takes straight up and does a hammerhead stall before it glides back to earth. The one problem I have run into is the durability. I have gone through two palnes and haven't really played with it much. The propeller broke on the first one and on the second, the gears seemed to have stripped."
5,"Works as advertised, and good service","I purchased this product because drying is my least favorite part of washing my car. I've used it a lot, and it works as advertised - my car dries spotlessly. It's definitely a time-saver. My unit (which I bought soon afer it was released) developed a leak at the on/off switch. I spoke with P&G customer service, and just received a coupon for a free starter kit in the mail. The CS representative seemed a bit surprised about the leak too, so hopefully it's not a common occurance. Overall, a great product, and the company stands behind the product 100%."
1,Left resin/wax smears all over car and windows,"I first used this product with my own soap and it worked fine. The water where I live is a little hard, so I ended up drying up excess water spots with a towel, but overall it dried spotless.!!However, when I tried the product with mr clean soap streaks of wax or resin (possibly from the soap?) was left all over my car and windows. Re-waxing my car with a cleaner wax removed the resin from the body of the car; but the resin on the windows was much more difficult to remove.Just a warning that the soap is bad (I think). The product works fine without the mr clean soap."
2,"Good on windows, not so great for the rest of the car","I had a pretty dirty car and I used the Mr. Clean Starter Kit. I followed all the directions.I also washed my car in the shade, and I rinsed and soaped the car in portions as one reviewer mentioned. I waited about 30mins or more for the car to dry and the only parts that were really clean and shiny were the windows. It still left a lot of dirt on my car, despite all the scrubbing I did during the soaping step. It even took more water than what I would have used washing it the old fashion way. I looked that the FAQ sheet that came with the kit and it said that if you see streaks it may be dirt, and all you have to do is go through the steps again to get rid of it. It's just a hassle. At least I can wash my house windows with it until the filter get's used up. Otherwise it's a waste of money."
2,Still Hand Drying,"Tried the system for the first time today. Rinsed and rinsed and rinsed with the special filter. Still had to hand dry. Have not noiced any leftover film on the finish yet, I will check for that tomorrow. I plan on returning the washer and extra supplies to Target this weekend.You know what they say - if it sounds to good to be true - etc."
1,No thanks,"Not very well made, unconferatable, and do not contain any noise the person next to you will hear the music just as much as you do."
2,Do not purchase Sony DVD RW DRu-350A!,"It has a mechanical problem. After a few months, I have not been able to eject the disk. Also, it has a software problem as well. When you want to burn a CD or DVD, the driver does not recognize the blank CD or DVD that has been inserted (my OS is Windows XP). I did not expect these kinds of problems with Sony."
4,Pretty Good for the Money,"i bought this watch atPac-Sun using a gift cert. i recieved. I liked this watch because the flashing seconds behind the hands looked much more modern than some of Fossils other styles. I did not want something my dad would wear, but i also wanted something profesional looking too. The only thing i didnt like about the watch was that it doesnt illuminate in the dark, which can be somewhat annoying."
1,broke after a few months,I bought this Insten cradle for my Treo 755p. It stopped working after a few months so I give it one star. Now I have to buy another cradle.
4,Very Good,"I've never owned an L.A. Guns CD but have loved the singles that were released back then. I have grown to like all of the songs on the CD, some of which I never even knew they sang. I will have to look into other CD's by them and maybe purchase."
1,Painful,"This album [stinks]. I bought it expecting some cool riffs and maybe a catchy melody or two. No. Instead I got an album that is best listened to in five second segments if at all. If you like people with instruments cracking each other over the skull with them and screaming at the top of their lungs, then this album is for YOU! Amazingly, even whilst SCREAMING, you will not understand more than 3.7% of the lyrics. YOU WILL BE LIKE, 'HOLY ....!""Fans of music be warned."
1,not happy,"Cute idea, but didn't work for my twins. the animal lays too flat on their tummys, so it's not effective for bottle feedings. Maybe it will work better when they are older."
4,good product,"hey I know people read these review and that may decide if they buy the product or no. so here's my review on this product. I'm an electrician and I think its a good product it works just like it said a led flashlight and voltage detecter in a very compact device. but unless u just have to have it small to fit in your pocket or something. Id spent my money on the LVD2. Its the same size as a reguler detector and also has a led light, but detects the sorch voltage a little better than the LVD1. and only cost a few dollers more. but both are excellent detectors and worth buying."
5,Very fun,"This is a great toy, but it needs batteries; it would be great if the car included a rechargeable battery."
2,We've Heard It All Before,"Yawnnnnn.....Nothing new here.... Selected stuff... We've heard it all before and if you are a fan, you probably have most of this. Forget the Live disc (#4) too. Get Hell Freezes Over and/or Hotel California and the first Greatest Hits....Henley and Frey must want some easy Christmas money with a few pennies going to Leadon, Felder, Schmidt, Walsh and Meisner. Variations of the notes in the booklet have shown up in print before - ARGH. These guys had a hard time working together because each was a 'genious' and a 'perfectionist'. I guess that's why there are no alternative takes. Come on guys.... Too bad..."
3,Eagles fan since 1972,"I tend to agree with Will Martin, as far as contentis concerned. It always seems as if the most primecuts of an album end up on the cutting room floor,so to speak. I know that ""Visions"" will always beone of the special cuts for me because it capturedthe original sound of the band as I remember itcoming out of the old KMET FM 98.7 airwaves, as Idrove my 1965 Baja Bug all over SoCal in thoseearly 1970's, when the Eagles really representedwhat the great southwest was all about. Yes, Iremember when the Eagles were more than just DonHenley and Glenn Frye, not to be dissing thosetwo mega talents, but Don Felder did lend anequally important sound that made them""The Eagles"". I was really surprised that""Visions"" was left off an important box setsuch as this. Too bad."

1,What an awful ending.,"This series started out very good. The first book, especially, pulls you in and hooks you. But in each subsequent book, logic drifts further and further into the background, while plot convolutions and ""surprises"" (which usually counter ""facts"" laid out in previous books) take the fore. And do they all have to end with a deus ex machina? Please!This was by far the worst, and fitting that being the worst and final book in the series, it has the worst and final ending of its own. The one star I am forced to give it, it does not deserve."
4,Don't read this book first,"Warning, this is the fifth and concluding book of a series, don't read it first, lest you become enraged and confused!The story of Kelvin of Rud plays out to its ending. The battles come faster, the magic grows stronger and the ultimate decision of who will win the day comes down to luck, magic, and perhaps a bit of something else.Everything that has a beginning has an end. This one just isn't the best I've read. I was a bit disappointed by the way the ending explained things.I get it, the clues were there throughout the series, but the payoff was, well... lacking something. I suppose this ending could be classified as ""happy"" but I'm not really sure that's how I'd classify it."
5,"Red, white, blue",Lets them know your for the USA. I wrapped them around my top split rail fence and up my flag pole.
3,OK but not her best,"Ms Wood wrote this book together with another author. Parts of the book are quite descriptive regarding the cruelties of the Third Reich with regard to the Jewish and Polish population - which can be disturbing to very sensitive readers. (There were parts that I wish I had never read, as they still linger in my memory and are most upsetting.)The plot was interesting in concept, albeit a little far-fetched, and I do wonder if it could have been based on fact. The story opens and closes well and ties in all the loose ends."
1,Seller Lists Item When Out of Stock,"All Pets Considered (Seller) unresponsive to emails, does not have item but keeps it listed, won't pull it."
4,A New Kind Of Spice In The Mix This Time!,"This is a fun, bouncy, and overall fabulous album with such great songs as ""Holler"", ""Tell Me Why"", Let Love Lead The Way, Waisting My Time, etc. Though one could, as I do, still miss the old Spice Girls sound, it's fun and interesting to see how they fare with experimenting with a new R&B sound. It's not my favorite that they've ever done, but still great album, as I have said before, though it can't help but detract from it to be constantly reminded that Darkchild produced most of it; ""Darkchild, Spice Girls, come on/let's dance! (etc.) I think that by song five we're pretty sure we've got that fact down. But that's nearly it. My message: Buy this album. I think you'll find it quite enjoyable!Hej do!"
2,Spice Girls Forever?,"Since most have said only good things about this album, I think it's important to let readers hear a different take. I am a Spice Girls fan most definitely, but I was very disappointed by their latest effort. Apart from Holler and If You Wanna Have Some Fun, the Spice Girls of yesterday have certainly grown-up... and got boring. Right Back At Ya is AWFUL! Since Geri Halliwell's departure (and she's not much good on her own), this group's music has gone flat. Part of their charm was pure fun and hamming it up. Now they've tried to sound more mature, but in that vain they've destroyed what made them different. Most of the songs on ""Forever"" sound the same as each other. Hopefully, they'll stay together long enough to record a fourth album that recaptures a sense of what put them on top."
3,"didn't make me ""holla"" like the first 2 albums","I was big on r&b and hip hop in the late 90's and barely listened to pop. Spice girls were the exception, I ADMIRED them. So when I heard they were doing an r&b album I was really excited. Holla was a good song but not great. The verses sounded a little bit like a rip off from the Lucy Pearl song Dance Tonight that had come out earlier that year. Weekend Love and several others were alright but didn't exactly move me much. Rodney Jerkins and the Flyte Time team work great with other artists, but the chemistry just wasn't there with the spice girls. Easily forgettable."
4,OK,"I was a little disappointed with the Spice Girls when I heard the single 'Holler' because it didn't sound like them. It sounded more into Melanie B's direction of rap and r&b. But I listened to the album anyways and found out that it's a highly underrated album. 'Let Love Lead The Way', the other single is such a beautiful ballad. Their FIRST single 'Goodbye' to Geri is also a tear jerker. Don't let the Spice Girls fool you, this is different from their other albums but it's still good."
1,This is awful!,"Scary, sporty, posh, and baby are collectively known as Stupid Spice: and their latest album proves it. When they did pure pop music it was pretty bad, but at least they knew they were talentless puppets and didn't take themselves TOO seriously. Now because of their inflated egos, they seem to believe that they are <cough> serious musicians! THIS HAS TO END NOW! Don't buy their albums and they will go away."
1,Ugh.,"Awful, awful, AWFUL! This album is as bad as the other two. If you have any sense at all, you'll spent your money elsewhere."
5,The best album of the year-this album defines excellence,"This is definitley the best album of the year.It has 11 tracks - ballads , r'n'b tracks ,and dance and disco tracks and each one of them brilliant.There isn't bad song on this album and every one of them could be a single.The album sees the girls growing up which will cater for their fans better as they have also grown up.This album has broader appeall than their last two and will appeal to even more people.EVERYONE HAS GOT TO GET THEMSELVES A COPY OF THIS ALBUM!It's so good you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.SPICE GIRLS FOREVER!"
4,great product,"great tool for what it is, no way could you go buy the materials and make one for cheaper. I've carried my bike on it (crf250)probably a thousand miles now. No problems. (vehicle is a new tahoe, clearance from back window is better than six inches)"
2,Less Than Stellar,"This book is a good resource for those who are curious about just what lesbians do in bed and how it is done, but overall it is really just stating the obvious. The book has cheesy drawings throughout, and though helpful if you're entirely clueless or can't figure some things out on your own, are little more than an amusing sidebar to the book's insulting elementary subject matter. That said, it's apparently been helpful to many others... reprinted several times now, it's still fairly high in the sales list. The book is organized like an encyclopedia of terms relating to lesbian sex, and is very informative, but just seems a little simple in some cases. Overall, a helpful aid but it won't enlighten you with any new ideas."
5,Excellent story!,I truly enjoyed this story. My first Nan Ryan book but not my last. Widowed Princess Marlena goes to America to raise money for her country. She takes ill and is replaced by a woman who could be her twin that works in a saloon as an actress/singer. The actress is wanted for theft and that's where Virgil Black comes in. He's assigned to bring her to jail. He spots the redhead and takes her with him even though she tells him time and again that she is a Princess. Sparks fly as they travel by horse to the final destination. This book has to have one of the best endings I have ever read.
1,"In Brief, Use Caution","Having installed the product according to instructions, I found it disabled all sound files and gave me a black screen. The only means of recovery was to reboot, and the only remedy for the product's interference was to remove the card and all its drivers. Highly unacceptable behavior for a product, and I returned it."
4,Comfortable shoe for people with back problems,"My husband is very glad that I purchased this shoe for him. Although the look isn't the greatest, the fit and comfort is well worth the purchase price."
3,for beginners on a budget,I actually owned one for about a year. it is a very basic beginners bass. nothing too special about it. not a terribly bad option if your just trying to get intoroduced to the instrument and dont have too much money to spend. although i will say it is a bit heavier then your average instrument. all in all i give it a resounding: meh...
4,Good intoductory book on chess,"Very well laid out and clear, but my eight year old and five year old need it explained to them as we go along and only get some of it."
4,excelent starter,"I found this book great and easy for learning the moves, and also the idea behind the game. Strategy is a little beyond this book but, good learning tool, ""you gotta crawl before you walk!"""
5,Beautifully illustrated,Really beautiful illustrations by Ezra Jack Keats in this version of Over In the Meadow. The sing-song verses in this book combined with the lovely pictures makes this the perfect read- aloud story. I would be happy giving this book as a gift.
5,Just love it.,"Combines color, number and vocabulary introduction into one. This can be sung as well. This illustrator is one of my favorites."
2,TechEdge Sharpening System,"The Edge Restorer, using two tungsten carbide cutters to restore new angles to a rounded edge, works well, but has trouble with thicker knife blades. The Diamond Fingers Sharpener and the Tech Hone Fingers don't seem to work well at all. I've followed the directions closely and even gone to the Furi website to watch a sharpening video, but without much luck. The Tech Hone Fingers does not touch up the edge as a Chef's Steel does and the Diamond Fingers Sharpener seems to make the blades duller. I get a good initial edge with the Edge Restorer, but it seems to get ruined when I use the other two parts of the system. I've gone back to using a steel to maintain the edge."
5,Furi Ease,"I found the Furi Pro Knife system to be a little intimidating when I first removed it from the box. However, I took the time to watch the included 'Rachel demo video' which showed how extremely easy it was to use. Not only was it easy, but it really does work. Knives I've had for ages were given new life, as well as my Furi knives which was my initial reason for purchase. I wish it came with a better case to store it in though, I don't foresee it lasting too long."
3,Tech Edge Pro Knife Sharpening System,"Not as good as I thought it would be for the price, but it was OK."
4,Furi,Do yourselves a favor and do a google search. This knife sharpener is for sale every place else starting at $25.99. Amazon is the most expensive by far. Sorry Amazon I use you for lots of shopping but this is way out of line!!
5,Luscious music,"Starting with one of Cristian Castro's most beautiful songs, it goes on to gorgeous bolero after gorgeous bolero. Lush, romantic sounds like this are hard to find. The human voices are definitely among the best I've ever heard. Not one of them in this anthology sounds less than beautiful. That is rare in an anthology."
2,Some helpful activities but not creative or comprehensive,"This workbook has some helpful activities for use with children of divorce. However, there is no theoretical overview for practitioners, and the activities are ""paper and pencil"" exercises so not very engaging for children. The vignettes about other children are a helpful addition. Readers may be interested in the following books:Creative Interventions for Children of DivorceComplete Group Counseling Program for Children of Divorce: Ready-To-Use Plans & Materials for Small & Large Groups, Grades 1-6Dinosaurs DivorceWas It the Chocolate Pudding?: A Story For Little Kids About Divorce"
3,The tumultuous life of a kamikazi pilot,"I read Osamu Ozawa's story while camping with Boy Scouts. The boys wondered why I read so much-- it was because I couldn't put this book down.Osamu Ozawa's life was tumultuous--he survived a plane crash on the runway during the Battle of Okinawa. He went from poverty to riches in Japan, then moved to America, where he became so poor that he didn't have enough to eat. The first thing he did after being paid to teach classes for Chuck Norris was to buy a bowl of fried rice. He said it was one of the best meals he had ever eaten. He was a samurai, and asking for a hand-out would have been dishonorable to Osamu.The book taught me that failure is a natural part of success. Osamu experienced both so many times in his life that I'm beginning to understand that failure is a learning experience. Failure often leads to success.Osamu died in April, 1998. After reading this book, I'm sorry I didn't get to meet him."
4,Not quite what I was expecting . . .,". . . .But, interesting. The seller delivered quickly and the book was in the condition described. The fact that the book was not what I expected was my fault for not researching it enough."
3,Detail of Failed Experiments,"What I got after I finished this book was a list of things that didn't work. It would have been a perfect ending save for the final page expounding on how upset the author got at the difficulties and skepticism of his research.Ultimately, it is an interesting book but nothing learned from this book will ever be useful aside from what-not-to-do."
3,"Good introduction to Amplifiers, but lacks technical depth.","The book provides a very good introduction to the world of Audio Amplifiers. Quite wordy.It fails to give a good technical/mathematical explanation of why and how. Nor does it give the grounds/basis from which to design a circuit. For example, what are the right values for a Zobel Network stabilisation circuit on the output of an amp? Rule of thumbs seem to be the go here, often they are not good enough.If you want to understand, what bias current is best in the input stage's differential long-tail pair, or how to caluclate and make the best choice emitter resistor value for the output stage devices, then this book ain't for you."
1,I sold my copy....,I have bought many books on amplifiers..and agree with many other reviews here...this book is not worth the paper it is printed on! The cordell or self (power amp) books are much better.
4,hacker = good guy,"this collection of eric's papers is a wonderful start for anyone intersted in the open source ""revolution."" i suggest visiting his website also. eric's view on software development/management will change the way anyone thinks about the process and appreciate the power of the internet. also the word ""hacker"" won't strike one as a criminal anymore. great book."
1,Open source is a joke...,"I don't see how or why this author is so big in the Open Source community. This collection of his opinions is uneducated and insufferable. Why should we take for gospel what he writes? The book's essays have no sense of cohesion (what's with the essay on how to be a hacker? If I were a programmer, I'd care, but I'm not so why is it in here?). His first few essays summarize the book: Hacker: Heroes of the Computer Revolution by Steven Levy. Was hugely disappointed that O'Reilly saw fit to publish this."
4,Provocative,"This bible of the Open Source movement is well written and provocative. It lays out the thinking behind Open Source clearly and takes one into new territory about how work should be valued in the information society. Not every point is convincing and recent history may make some points obsolete, but it is well worth looking at. And good read also."
4,Great,"I needed to buy this book for my English class, I thought the book will be in bad conditions because it was used but not it was completely in useful. I would like to buy any other book if I needed at Amazon."
5,Top notch big white Canon lens.,"So much has been written about this lens (and note 98% rate it 5 stars) that there isn't much left to say. I own the 70-200 f2.8 and because of that this lens does not seem especially heavy to me. The 100-400 is the only zoom lens I use on a regular basis, and it always goes on outings with me. The lens focuses quickly and accurately and produces immensely satisfying colors. I use a monopod when I will be using it close to the 400 range to avoid sway; at that point I do feel the weight. This works very well for me. I use primes 90% of the time and this lens the vast majority of the rest of the time. Great lens for motorsports, horse races, zoo shots, etc. The push-pull takes a little time to adjust to, then is easy and automatic. Love this lens."
4,Fast and clear,"Very fast lens with amazing clarity and results.Using with a 60D and liking every picture taken with this.Great zoom and ease of use.IS (img stabalization) could have been a bit better, but may be its not easy with such focal length."
3,Lack of information,"The shipment and the quality of the delivered pack have been perfect.But I really want to complain about a lack of information in the website. When I ordered this Canon Lense the website suggested to buy also a Canon ET-83C Lens Hood for EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L IS USM Lens and a Canon LZ1324 Lens Case because they were not included! And I bought them.What a surprise when I opend the shipment of the Canon Lens and I discovered that they are included...now I have two of them.This is not fair, now I'll try to return those items!"
5,Another Superb Canon Product,"Outstanding performance. Much, much much better than low end lens of the same strength. Still new to me but the only drawback I have found is the weight. That is a small price for such good performance."
5,More than I expected,"The online description did not include several items I was prepared to purchase separately. Carrying case, and lens hood. Was pleasantly surprised when they were received with the lens. Prompt, good, honest service. Fair price. Wade"
3,Going to Canon after only four days,"I doing this review after 6 days, well to be honest I cant review it yet. I have only taken a hand full of shots with the lens as it keeps telling its not connected to my canon 7d. I have called ans canon and they have told me to ship it back to them. I will being sending it in the next day or so. I will keep this going to show what happens in this process. I will say that the few times I did get to shoot it I did like what I was able to get. So now we wait."
1,"Awful,do not buy","My husband and I just tried this product and I have to say it was one of the most awful experiences I have ever had sexually. It does absolutely nothing to ""stimulate"" the female. About 6 minutes after applying it, I had a headache and difficuly breathing, then the numbness set in. It was probably the equivalent of rubbing Oragel on your genitals. My husband said it was the worst thing he had ever tasted, made his throat hurt and go numb and gave him a headache also. I would not recommend this to anyone. At almost 9 dollars a box for 3 tiny packets, it is probably one of the biggest ripoffs on the market and definetly the most misrepresented female sexual aids out there."
1,Yuck! Used french fry oil,"This is the worst product I have ever tried. Not only does it smell real bad, which is a turn off. It also burned alot. I would have enjoyed a lit stick of dynamite more. This product is a let down and falsely advertised. I am definitely sending this product back! I will stick with KY warming lubricant."
1,"Unethical billing. They will keep billing you, even though you did not sign up for it!","The product works, but they steal your money!I purchased a sample and it did appear to work like icy hot, but not as extreme. Then a few months later a package arrived and I was billed $60!!!! It also stated that I will be billed again next month. I called to cancel, but was given the run around. If anyone is interested in a class action, count me in!!!"
3,Pretty good.,"This is the first book I've read by this author. I fell in love with Thomas and really liked Lyssa. I think it must be extremely accurate as far as the 14th century is concerned, but I got a little bored with all the excess detail of the time. All in all, it was a good story and I would never tell anyone not to read the book. Some here loved the detail Ms. Samuels uses, others thought it too much and there seemed to be a few who didn't like the book because of the lack of modesty in some of the conversation, but it all seemed accurate to me based on my knowledge of history. I think the author did some serious research about the time period and I appreciate that. You should give it a try if you love a wonderful hero in your story because Thomas is 4-star for sure."
1,oh so boring,i read the first chapter for free. it started out really good. so i bought it with a high expectation but then i just could not finish it. there was no chemistry between the h/h. i enjoyed her other books such as lucien's fall and night of fire.i specially did'nt like the fact that they talk so much during their love scenes . the hero sounds like he is reading from some kind of a romantic script. it is just very fake and too dramatic.
5,Historical Magic,"Barbara Samuel has captured the magic of 14th century love and life with wonderful accuracy. When the widowed Lady Elizabeth returns from exile she discovers a mysterious but captivating knight guarding her lands and her people.The mystery deepens as she comes to know this gentle knight, Dark Thomas, as he is called by the common folk. Although sometimes awkward in his actions, his heart is as great as his size. But Elizabeth soon questions her feelings and discovers that she does not like the answers.Set in the dynamics of rural England, this story takes on a life that thrusts the reader into the simplistic yet terribly complicated medieval age...when the word of a king has the power over life and death, and the tenements of caste govern all. Journey with two people as they discover their love and struggle for happiness under the harsh rule of their ""social"" age."
2,Basic knowledge booklet on Game birds,Very basic book. I don't recommend it. You can get the same information on line & free from the local extension offices or the back of feed sacks!
4,Wild and not-so-wild women,"Not all the women in this book are wild, some aren't wild at all, but all the brief essays about them are interesting and amusing. Many of the women are already well-known, many more are not well-known at all. It is fascinating to read about all the president's wives with their very different personalities and attitudes to being in the White House. My absolute favourite is Mamie Eisenhower, who refused to bestir herself about anything and said ""all women over fifty should stay in bed till noon."" I only have three years to go, hooray! Truly a woman after my own heart. I was a bit taken aback though when Cher's romance at forty with a twenty-two-year old boy is referred to as a December-May romance. Come, come, Ms. Stephens, forty is scarcely December. September at the latest."
4,"Good book, but it doesn't have anything really new.","The strategies and facts in the book are well-presented and well-written, and there are several good tidbits of information inside... But as far as being what its title suggests, well, I reckon it's good marketing. It does provide much of the information from Caro's original ""Book of Tells"" and expands on some of it, but as I wrote a moment ago, it doesn't have anything that someone who's been playing live (not online) poker for a year or so wouldn't know already -- other than a few bits here and there.I'd recommend this book to beginners and studious amateurs."
5,Perfect for little ears!,Bought these for my 5 year old. PERFECT size for his little ears. Easy for him to put in...better than the regular ear buds that come with MP3 players.
4,Marshmallow earphones,"Pretty comfy and great sounds. I had gone through ipod earphones and skullcandy headphones before purchasing this one. My previous Skullcandy headphones lasted about a year before it went bad, so I hope these JVC ones last about the same time."
4,Great!,"These JVC earphones are 4/5 because of the following reasons.1) They tend to SOMETIMES fall off your ear easily when you are doing stuff which conflicts with the wire, so put them inside of your shirt and you're good to go.2) The ear piece is very very very comfortable, it sometimes doesn't even feel like Im wearing earphones.3) The sound quality is PRETTY GOOD but not as loud as others."
3,book about Monk,Bought this for a friend who loved the charecter. She also loved the book!! Said it was a great substitute for her when she was at the beach.Looking for another one now.
3,Stapler OK,"The Staple-Less Stapler. Pack of Three (Blue,Red,Green) - Sold by InkCityStoreThe staplers are OK for stapling two sheets of plain paper.It is not as strong as a regular stapler. It defineltly is a lightweight bond.They need to make a heavy duty one for multiple sheets."
3,Still a basic book on sensing hands,"This book is very well written especially in the introductive chapters. The author considerations about the exercise are really great. Unfortunately, as a Tai Chi instructor, I was looking for something much more advanced in sensing (or most commonly ""pushing"") hands. Even though the work has been very well done, the pushing exercises are still introductive one. The use of the waists and the application of the ""chan su shin"" movement to the exercise are neither explained nor mentioned. As any Tai Chi person knows this is the key and the most important tip on sensing hand and generally speaking on all the tai chi movements. Anyway this book is the first one completely dedicated to the item and I really appreciate the author effort on approaching the sensing hand explanation in this work."
3,Can you keep a secret?,"Already some years ago, the FBI made the ""Elvis-file"" available for the public. It's the best-sold FBI-file in history. Elvis-The Secret Files is based on the FBI files and contains remarkable interpretations from John Parker.The files contain letters (e.g. from people in 1956 concerned about Elvis' supposed bad influence on the American youth), pictures and other ""facts"" only interesting for the die-hard Elvisfan. Parker comes up with a theory that it is likely that Elvis has been murdered, perhaps even by the mafia. Elvis was swindled for about $1 million with the redecoration of one of his planes and the planned lease of it. The plan went wrong and Elvis was supposed to testify in a lawsuit against those swindlers at the end of August 1977. Elvis died at August 16, 1977...Read this book yourself and make up your own mind. One thing is for sure: you won't be bored."
4,A Favorite Artist...,"Linda Ravenscroft is one of my favorite Fantasy Artists. On the strength of this I bought this book and I was not disappointed.I do have a degree in Fine Arts and have been an artist all my life, also, so the sections concerning color, etc., are just repetition to me, and not necessary.However, the illustrations done by Linda, and the last section, where she shows others' work, are delightful.I do, like the previous reviewer, wish she had gone into more detail as to how she arrives at her own finished products, but I don't believe that this lack makes them any less enjoyable to view.Yes, this book has its lacks, but it is still an honorable member of my personal library, and one to which I will refer many times over...I don't need her to tell me how to draw Faeries, as I have my own techniques and sources, but I still enjoy this book!"
2,What a brat!,This book is particularly silly. She is such a brat. I don't know that I really like these books as they are so far from how we live and the values I want my children to have. The parents are never around and she gets in so much trouble without regard to anyone else. I don't think we will be reading any more of these books. Recommended for 4-8 years.
5,Outstanding book,"This book is a classic, it takes psychiatric medicine and helps not only the professional but the patient as well to understand the field in great detail, while at the same time keeping it all simplistic. I most strongly recommend this book."
4,Psychiatric Drugs Book,"THis book was just what the Doctor ordered. THere was one problem for me, though. THe information was somewhat ""dated""...... older. I could not find what I was looking for. However, all in all, the presentation was nice, neat and professional....nice textbook.Timothy A."
2,Great movie-- NO REPEAT PLAY,"My son loves these movies. I repeat, he LOVES these movies. The major problem here is that there is no repeat play option. Some of these movies come with it, some without. At out house we have these movies playing all day long, even if we are in another room or he is napping. He barely watches them, but he likes the music while he plays or naps or whatever. The repeat play option is crucial to these movies, and it seems like the newer ones do not have this option. Please baby einstein, please make this a feature on all your movies!!"
5,Loves it!,"I really think that this is one of the greatest shows EVER! I love Paris and Nicole! They are very outgoing, funny people who don't care what other people think. My only problem with this show is that I watch it so much that I now walk around saying ""That's hot"" and ""Loves it""!"
1,Why watch this?,"Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie are spoiled, arrogant, ignorant, and self-centered. I can't believe The Simple Life has a second season, let alone a hit one, that is soon on its way to DVD. I really hope America watches the show to laugh at these women, because if they actually think there is any redeeming quality in them as human beings, that is sad. Both these girls, like Angelyne, are famous just because, with no purpose. They make millions off their stupidity, by doing nothing but making fun of others and laughing at anyone who is different. I live in L.A. and see girls like this all the time, but its horrible that we not only make these girls famous because of their stupidity, but get them richer than their parents already are because of it. If anyone is smart, they would stay away from this show before Paris Hilton becomes President of the USA and Nicole Richie becomes her First Lady."
4,Obviously staged; surprisingly hilarious,"I have no doubt at all that these episodes were staged (since when does a ""spontaneous"" show need a story editor?). Their contrivance annoys you at first and then the entertainment is so good that you forgive and forget. This is much funnier than the first season, which now seems almost solemn with its ""fish out of water"" premise. The party girls have to get across the country without any money. They beg and borrow, work as maids in a nudist colony, trap for crawfish in New Orleans, work/screw up in a sausage factory, etc. Both Paris and Nicole are more relaxed before the cameras. Great for more than a few laughs."
4,"Wide tolerances, but what do you expect for the $$?","3.5 stars. It came with a cracked handle (not from Amazon) which I repaired rather than fool with a return/exchange (-1 star). It took a lot of time to flatten the sole until I got access to a belt sander (-0.5 star). The chip breaker needed to be flattened to fit the iron, but frog fit was good, and the mouth was square. The frog adjustment knob has moderate backlash, but is a minor annoyance. After all the tuning, the plane produces thin fluffy shavings without chatter. If I had to do it all over again, I'd find a vintage Stanley/Bailey, but I'm satisfied with the end product. The 3.5 stars rating is a function of tool quality and economy."
4,AMAISING,"So, I boaght this book for my dads b-day. I still haven't given it to him yet but I know its great. It had just come in the mail and I was crious about my perchus. I read the table of contence.It looked interesting and spiritule. Then I turned to a random page and saw something that might be be interesting.- Well it was, it was fastinating! I know he'll love it for two resons 1) I know my father 2) it was on his wish list."
5,Great book!,"I bought this for my daughter, who was in Kindergarten at the time. She loved it!! She was able to read the book and the story really captured her attention and imagination. I recommend this book for little ones that are able to read. They will love it."
1,dont like this ink at all,I dont like this ink at all no smooth flow at all and have to stop and try to bring the ink down in a great pen that I have used for years . Puhless this ink is crap Im sorry i ever bought it now i know . I would not reccomend this to anyone at all . end of story . thanks .
2,Cheap Monster Signal Cable,It works well but the wires are unshielded so I had tons of EFI interference that was highly audible through my speakers. These cheaper cables are just not worth it because if you really want clean audio you will be buying another cable in the future. I recommend the higher end monster cables that are shielded. those are a dream
4,Oldies but Goodies,Listening to this CD brought back a lot of great memories. Their harmonies are wonderful.
1,CANUS Goat Milk Soap,"I am not pleased with Canus Goat Milk Soap because only 2/3 of the bar has the pleasantly fresh goat milk scent. The remaining 1/3 is sulfur. After bathing, later in the day, I began to spell sulfur around me. I didn't realize it was the soap until I smelled the bar and it had a very strong sulfur oder. Unfortunately, I have three bars left and I will only be able to use approximately 2/3 of the bar. Sorry, but I will never purchase this brand again. I rate it 1/8 of a star."
3,A quirky little tale about a girl interested in trolls.,"This is an odd story about a girl who is fascinated by trolls. She finds that her mother has had an experience with outsmarting a troll, and eventually the girl must also outsmart a troll she encounters while walking through the dark woods. James Marshall, the illustrator, is the author & illustrator of the beloved ""George and Martha"" books - I suppose the author of this book, Edward Marshall, is his brother(?). This book is easy for children to read on their own."
5,an uplifting glimpse on the realities of dying,"This book is a beautiful gift from a dying man to the living. It is a reminder that life is fragile and that what we think is of utmost importance often isn't. It is rare to get this close to the feelings of the CEO of a major company. Without being sappy, the author thoughtfully shares the daily chronicle of his life from the first inkling that something is awry through choices he faced and decisions he made in treament options and their side effects. For people in the business rat race, Gene lays out the business and process of saying his goodbyes, along with realistic insights on being sick and dying and how he chose to spend the diminishing hours of light in his otherwise charmed life. Like writing his own epitaph, Gene shares glimmers of what in the end were his proudest moments. In so doing, he shows us how to create more perfect moments while we are still living."
3,Unfortunate arrogance,"This was supposed to be a quick inspirational plane read. However, I had to put it down a few times before I could finish. Not because of overwhelming emotion, but because I had to calm my frustration over the arrogance of the text. All in all an interesting story. Unfortunately, most of the story line is provided within these reviews already. He led a life that most people could not relate to. A speech that Steve Jobs gave at Stanford's graduation last year, in which he discussed his brush with cancer/mortality, was much more inspiring and meaningful; and it was only a few paragraphs."
3,More enthusiasm than discipline,"Mrs. Yang's love and admiration for the beauty of Korean costume are evident throughout the book, which abounds with gorgeous, full-color photographs of hanbok, or native Korean garb. Unfortunately, information on the evolution of hanbok is sparse and difficult to tease out of the text. This appears to be, in large part, due to an actual shortage of data, but this too is difficult to confirm from the text. A more systematic discussion of the sources of available information on Korean costume, and greater attention to chronology in the text, will be desired by costume scholars, though most casual readers will find ample enjoyment in the wonderful photographs of beautiful silk garments."
5,Excellant value!,"This is an excellant and important study tool. Concerning the esthetics of this copy, I would not be giving it 5 stars if I was paying $295 dollars like you would be paying for a good Replica, (or how about upwards of $1000 to $1500 dollars or more for a poor to good copy of an original 1841 Bagsters?) This New Testament Hexapla is yet a sturdy oversized copy. The print is crisp and readable and primarily used as a reference anyway. But even if it was used for daily reading, everything is there and all is very readable. Take this publication away, and you'd be digging deep in your pockets for a Replica or one of the beaten up Originals; or worse yet, not having access to any copy at all."
4,Reasonably Priced Surround Sound package,"I purchased this speaker system to replace a Bose Lifestyle system that I moved to another room. I have to say that the sound quality is surprisingly better than Bose's much more expensive cube speakers and Acoustimass module. The included setup directions were easy to follow, but I did double check information on the Polk Audio website and found a great deal more detail on the best configuration for home theater speakers. The included wall mounting brackets were quite easy to use. I didn't need the front speaker stands and I am not sure who would actually use them (they have a large footprint but are less than a foot tall). Overall, I think for $800 this is a pretty good speaker solution for a 5.1 home theater speaker package."
5,Super Duper System!,Excellent product. We have been very pleased with our purchase. The quality and features are excellent and the price just right. I would definitely purchase from Amazon again.
5,Logical Christianity for the modern age.,"Emil Brunner doesn't poke Christianity down the reader's throat. This book does away with the sugar coating other writers have put on Christian writings, but for me, Brunner is much easier to swallow than most contemporary Christian authors."
2,I've read more than 30 Niven books and this was the only one I didn't like,"Simply stated, it's a thin story. I forced myself to finish it even though I didn't like any part of the book, because I've read so many good Niven books in the past. These guys are definitely capable of doing better. I recommend The Mote in God's Eye or Lucifer's Hammer as far better examples of their work."
2,no picture,"The product itself I have no problem with. I knew I wouldn't receive directions, however, I didn't receive a picture like everyone else so it made putting the piece together a little more difficult!"
5,received quickly and in great shape,received this lens within the same week of purchasing. in great condition and was also affordable. i almost returned it due to it being a mix up on the order (mistake on my part) but decided against it.thanks for the reliable service. would def buy from this person again!
2,bad lens,"I used it to shoot from an elevated angle. The result were disappointing.....I paid $[...] but I don't think it is even worth more than $[...] to tell you the truth.The colors are lifeless, ""burnt-out"". There are no details on the images. You can see the samples on my site: [...] Look for the huge house with the red roof. You will see what I am talking about. Normally, I use the 17-40 L on my elevated system. I thoguht the 20mm would be a good replacement even if it not as good as the 17 40. I think even the 18-55 Canon kit lens produces better images. Add a few hundred bucks and buy a decent lens."
5,Such a refreshing treat,I bought this strictly to pamper my tired feet. It feels so refreshing when you put it on and it smells great. Such a treat...
3,Nice foot spray,"This product feels great at first, but I thought it felt very sticky on my bare feet once applied."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!,THOUGHT IT WOULD BE PICTURES BUT IT WAS JUST A SOURCE OF WHERE TO FIND THE FILMS AND PICTURES AND SO ON.
1,"Weak, poor quality","This is a very, very mild ginger tea. I take at least 2 bags in 6oz of water to even taste it.I also found the quality rather cheap compared to similar priced teas. Here are just some of the problems I found:1. Cannot open sachet without scissors. Many are missing tear marks.2. The tag falls off on half the tea bags. So you end up fishing the bag out of your tea.3. The tag is glued to the sachet on several (maybe 20%) of the bags.4. The tea bag rips apart when opening the sachet or when squeezing out your tea."
2,Should Have Been a Bonus Disc,"It should be noted that ""ThirdShiftGrottoSlack"" contains only five songs and a mere thirteen minutes of music. The songs were all recorded during the sessions for Farrar's ""Sebastopol"" album (including a remix of ""Damn Shame""). If you like ""Sebastopol,"" there's no reason to think you won't like what little is included here.I have one question though: why is Jay Farrar making fans shell out extra coin for such a slight package? Caitlin Cary, Ryan Adams and The Jayhawks, just to name a few, have all released recent albums including bonus CDs that are as long or longer than this EP without tacking on additional costs to their fans. Seems to me that Jay Farrar could have done the same or maybe opened his vaults and thrown in some old demos or something to beef this package up a little bit.Overall, a way too brief EP, even at the reduced price it lists for."
1,Why not just pray harder?,This book on tape does a lot of blessing and praying but not much convincing analysis and construction.
2,The authors certainly cracked the code by writing this book,This book benefits the authors more than the reader. It is just a rehash of tired old ideas. The codes are stupid. WHo has time to crack codes while reading?? Low on substance reeks of a holier than thou attitude.
1,Two people who provably cracked the code are...,"...the authors of this book themselves, who do quite well at peddling this stuff to others. As for YOUR odds of using their so-called formula to achieve wealth? That's another matter entirely. If you want to know all you need to know about Hansen/Allen and this whole ""instant millionaire"" business, visit my blog, www.shambook.blogspot.com, and search the blog under ""Hansen"" or ""chicken soup."" I've put a fair amount of time into looking at these fellows, and the self-help industry as a whole. Prepare to have your eyes opened.Steve Salerno, author, SHAM: How the Self-Help Movement Made America Helpless"
3,An OK Light,"Battery life is somewhat short, the different colored LEDs are nice, the Xenon isn't as bright as I would like. Decent light but I expected more from a Streamlight."
4,Love this show,"I love this show I got it for my sister and the two of us became coach potatos and watched the entire first disc in one night. Will make you laugh. The only thing that kinda dissapointed me, which i knew before i bought it was the way the disc are packaged. i wouldnt have minded spending alittle extra money for them to add alittle more plastic for the disc to connect too. The outer caseing is fine like you would get with regular dvd you buy but the disc are in these little paper shleves.They could of done better!! But all in all i love the product and would recomend it if you like the show or just want a few laughs.!"
4,"Best season, but CENSORED!","The first season will remind you of why you liked the show (forget the currend seasons now airing). Everything is clicking from the start.The only problem here is that the DVD is CENSORED! In the Wrestling episode, when Donna has Eric in a head lock she asks why he is not fighting back. Hyde's comment about ""Why, look where his head is!"", which is right next to Donna's breasts, has been cut. It was cut way back after the first airing. Too bad it was not restored."
3,A terrific story needs better telling,"The rise of Danny Greene and his battle with the Cleveland mafia makes for an interesting tale. As a relative newcomer to northeastern Ohio, I found the book to be a useful history lesson. However, the writing lacks polish. Porrello could use a good editor, and was ill-served by his publisher who allowed so many spelling and punctuation errors to go to print. It's also hard to keep track of the large number of players mentioned in the book, and sometimes their relation to events at hand is unclear, at best. Still, if you like to read about wise guys, it's a book worth picking up."
3,Interesting for history of Cleveland,If you want to know how the streets run in Cleveland then read this book. You get the history of the mob and how criminals work together to get ill gain.
3,Cheap shoe,"Cheap shoe, but for a heavier guy like myself (180lbs) I find it doesnt offer much support.For soccer shoes buy a little smaller than your normal size (1 to .5 sizes smaller than running shoes), you want it tight, mine were a little loose in the boots, maybe its just this particular shoe.Other than that, I can't complain, they were a good price."
2,Flashback!,"Whoa! I haven't seen this movie since I was nine years old and my best friend and I were keeling over from exhaustion in the living room. The only thing that sticks out in my memory of this video is my friend collapsing on the couch in defeat and both of us despising the perfect, perky brunette on the far right (Jennifer Love Hewitt, going by the name ""Love"" and envoking retches of disgust and jealousy by us ""average"" girls). I could keep up, although barely, and only because I was a naturally hyperactive child. And I even remember muttering ""Well, you can't sweat, Barbie,"" when her bubbly voice announced another round of grueling dance moves. I don't recommend buying this video unless you're an adult with no body fat whatsoever and wired on expresso. Rent it instead--you'll get a workout AND you can return it when you tire of listening to Barbie's grating voice."
4,Simple projects that keep kids captivated,I expected the projects to be a little more extravagant. But I forgot that it doesn't take much to fascinate children.
4,A great lens that takes some time to master,"I use this lens with a 30D.Pros: Sharp, great bokeh, great DOF, small, nice reach, did I mention sharp?Also, focuses very fast.Cons: The wide aperture is a 2-edged sword. Many times I wished I had used a smaller aperture to increase the amount of the subject in focus.But that's my fault because I haven't mastered the lens. Once you master the lens, it's truly great, worth every penny."
5,Can't find a single flaw...,Awesome Lens...Bought it 4 months ago and I've only used it occasionally. In the past few days I shot a tricky people-heavy job with a 35mm L on one 5d mk ii and this 85 on another. In post I frequently assumed an especially sharp shot was from a 35mm L file only to find it was from the 85...This is saying a LOT as the 35mm L is likely one of Canon's sharpest lenses. Bang-for-the-buck talk aside...this is simply a very very good lens.
3,Instructions are confusing,"It may be clear to one who is already a crochet expert, but as more of a beginning crochet-er, my daughter and I had difficulty understanding how to make the crochet flowers. Also, although the kit comes with extra beads and flower parts, there's no examples of how to use them to create the flower. It would be helpful if the company could make a better instruction book or put up a video"
2,Can hold 1 card & does not cover front of phone,"I got this product for very cheap. I do not think it was worth the little I paid for the following reasons:1. It can really only hold 1 credit card (max). I wanted it to hold at least 2 (my ID and credit card) - it cannot.2. The card that it holds is difficult to get in and out without taking the entire case off. This means very limited functionality. There is nothing like looking ridiculous in front of your friends and coworkers as you peel off your phone cover every time you need to get your card out.3. The case covers the back of the phone well, but leaves the front very vulnerable to damage. Since the front is more likely to get damaged, this makes it's protective functionality very limited.This is a really cool idea, but it is poorly executed. If you can get this item for cheap, are aware of these 3 major problems, and you still really want it anyways - go for it. Otherwise, save your money and get a better phone cover."
5,History Saved,"I liked this book very, very much. My favorite music is Southern R&B, so I particularly enjoyed the author's interviews with Cosimo Matassa and other old-time Southern recording engineers. Their work still sounds good. They have great stories, too, like the time Cosimo tried to cool off his studio with ice and a fan. I hope the Katrina disaster did not destroy some of our wonderful musical historic sites throughout Louisiana and Mississippi. I recommend Too Hot to Handle to anyone who loves music and recording."
5,works perfect on RHEL 4,I got this for connecting LTO4 tape drive to Red Hat Enterprise Linux server. Dell PE840 had only one PCI Express connector and it was already taken. Dell doesn't offer PCI-X SAS controller that was the available port on this machine. It works without hickups.
1,Blue&White?,"The description for this says that it is blue&white. It also appears blue&white in the image. However, when I received this, it was not. It was a mint green and blue. Would not recommend unless those are the colors you're going for."
5,Exactly what I expected,"It is exactly as I expected. Decent quality for the money. There is a small field of view because it is such a close view, but what I can see, I can see clearly. I purchased this to get a good view of saturn, and to see a bit closer on the moon. Definately a better view than in my 10mm, and was worth the money. (am using with an 8"" reflector)"
3,Does what it is supposed to do.,"I use it for Saturn. Most astronomy objects will be too dim to see much with this eyepiece. Jupiter is also bright enough. The hole on a 4mm eyepiece is very small. Focal length/ eyepiece mm=mag. Gives about 185x 5""750mm f/6"
2,Tedious and tiresome book...,"I got this book hoping it would be full of juicy information about the NYPD, etc. but it was hard to get past the first chapter. The writing is more like a work of fiction (too many flashy adjectives, not enough facts.) The author makes a good attempt to write about this detective but fails to convince the reader of the reality. Not the best 'cop book' on the market."
1,"terrible, terrible, terrible",terrible - that's all I can say - looks like they printed a powerpoint presentation. the examples assume you have the classmaterials already installed on your machines - with no instructions on where to get them or how to install them.save your money.
3,I hope This isnt who TBM are.....,"I've been a great fan of TBM ever since I bought Light A Match, and to tell the truth i was very dissapointed. Though many of the songs are catchy, well written and some are even great songs, the album as a whole is overdone, yet toned down from Light A Match. The lyrics are pop-like and preachy. Now I do admit there are some good songs, Wide-Eyed and Wasted is one of my favorites as it is somewhat like the stuff from LaM. A Safe Place, The Great Divorce, and Cold Hands are also decent songs however I really cant stand most of the other songs. I was pretty dissapointed that TBM decided to ditch the screamo stuff as that really added to their music. I cannot say who much I love Light a Match and how much Im hoping their next release is more of that style."
2,Half-truths and lies from glory-seeking alsoran,"Tom ""Dynamite Kid"" Billington may just be wrestling's biggest black mark. Never more than a mediocre worker, his notoriety stems from his drug addicition, wife-beating, and backstage confrontations. Having burned all his bridges, he now cashes in on the turn-f-the-century wrestling boom the only way he still can...by writing a book of his adventures. Sadly, it doesn't take a wrestling historian to work out that most of the content of this book has been, shall we say, ""tweaked""? This doesn't necessarily work to make Dynamite look like a saint, far from it, as his self-depreciation is quite vivid, but he certainly doesn't let the thruth get in the way of his teraing into the people he hates. If you're interested in the 80s wrestling boom there are far better books."
5,A wonderful adventure I didn't want to put down!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel! It offers so much to the reader...adventure, danger, romance, hope and so much more. Mr. Williams is a wonderful story teller. He makes his characters and their world come alive in such a way you feel as though you have been transported to another land and time. I became quickly and completely absorbed, not wanting to put the book down."
5,Completly and Utterly Amazing,"I got this book yesterday and I just got finished reading it! It is one of the greatest books I have ever read. Not only does it tell of virtues and morals, right and wrong, good and evil; but it also has a compellign story line that intrigues you from the first paragraph until the last word. How the author uses words to captivate the senses and paint visual pictures are astounding! It amazes me how I just couldn't seem to stop reading. This book rivals J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, and definately one that I'll read again. Bravo Thomas Williams! And thank you for writing one of the greatest literary masterpieces ever. I truly love this book."
4,eye piece,I love this lens. Moon never looked more bright! I recommend it. Great price to boot. You will be happy.
1,Jack of All,This book covers unrelated material to ADO.NET and database programming. I say look for something else if you want to write database applications. Most of it is copy and paste of MSDN documentation.
4,You'll love it!!!,"I loved this CD! I can never get the songs out of my head. They are so catchy, and have the funniest words - like ""And when I cha-cha right out of that door!"" There's only one thing - when I first listened to this CD, I was unimpressed. I found Tracy's, Edna's and Motormouth Maybelle's voices irritating, but after giving this CD a chance, I realized that their voices give a little something special to the CD. In short, this CD DOES take some getting used to, but you'll love it in the end, I can promise you!!!!!!!"
3,"Fun, but definitely overrated!","No substance, no story, no quality singing -- to think that this is a musical! Enjoyable to watch, but not the ""great"" show the swayed-by-the-hype Tony judges want us to believe."
1,Overrated!,"Sure, it's funny. And entertaining. But this is one show that does NOT deserve all the lavish praises (even nominations) it's getting. While the music is okay, the show just simply isn't awards-material. The singing and the quality of recording are hardly what one would even consider decent: nasal and squeeky voices made worse by inconsistent sound engineering don't make for good listening.This is one show that's definitely worth watching; but not worth watching it win the major awards. There are MANY, MANY more musicals out there (wiuth REAL quality) that should rightfully be recognized instead of this overhyped show!"
2,Hairspray- Not What I Expected,"I recently saw the show in previews and was surpised by how bad it was. Nothing about this show makes it the next Producers. My opinion is that next to Mama Mia, it is the worst show on Broadway right now. The show is filled with corny, bubble gum songs that are a cross between Grease and Little Shop of Horrors. The only song in the score that is any good is the opening ""Good Morning Baltimore."" But if I heard the girl who played Tracy sing ""oh...oh...oh"" in that annoying high pitched squeal one more time I think I would have ripped my ears out. It's not worth the money to get this CD and definetely don't waste your time trying to get tickets."
4,Good for being used,"I always like getting used CD's on amazon because it's fast and cheap.This CD did have a skip on it during one of the songs that was not mentioned in the description, but I'm able to fast forward through it.But quick service and great price."
2,Hairspray-some great songs and such strange casting,"I know that ""Broadway voices"" are not always the classically trained voices but some of these voices are not just ""character voices"" but just are bad.The score deserves better!"
1,What's the big deal? Beats me.,"This is absolutely terrible. Has musical theatre sunk this low that this becomes a tony winning musical? This is bubble gum lifeless dumbed-down pop. If you like that, then fine. I'm just warning the people who expected quality musical theatre music. If you do, check out anything by Sondheim or William Finn."
5,A great Flashback,"Noone can argue that the mid 1990's were the greatest for professional wrestling. WCW was my favorite company (I was just a kid) But the lighting was better, stage was better, pyro was better, clearly WCW used their money to make the appearcne of the show much better than WWE. Great flashback to the greates time of my life (wrestling wise)The DVD however does miss a few things. Such as the biggest moment in wrestling history...Hulk Hogans heel turn., more of the cruseirwights and such. But it is still a fantastic collection, could easily be a 5 Disc set or even 10. Alot of stuff was left out."
4,Good but couldve been better,"I could think of more matches but hope WWE do best of NWO or best of PPVs from WCW like hog wild, spring stampede, bash at the the beach I think it will be a volume 2"
5,"A Lovely ""Legend""","""The Legend of Lady Ilena"" is an excellent story about Celtic life and one young woman's search to find her identity. ""Legend"" is rich in detail, and the characters are well-developed, from the headstrong Ilena to the noble Sir Durant. The plot has lots of action and takes many twists and turns as Ilena journeys across Scotland to find out why she is so different from the people with whom she grew up. The ending was perfectly set up for a sequel, and I hope to see one soon."
3,Good but look for something better,"Many of my classmates stopped reading the text half way through the semester. Perry & Potter are masters of creating step by step lists of fundamental procedures, but often leave out important details (especially during procedures requiring aseptic technique). We used this text in conjunction with the evolve course. The evolve course has great videos, and the lessons and explanations are better written than the accompanying text. I am actually looking for another fundamentals book because I just don't see myself referring back to this tome of ""written ambien"" anytime in the future."
1,Read the bad reviews!!!,"If I had only read the reviews that said the game has no installer, I would have saved myself a bundle of money on this garbage.This is my story: A friend gave me Baldur's Gate II as a gift and I'm the type of person that has to do #1 before #2 so I bought this... without reading the reviews.This ""game"" has no installer. They call this a ""game"" and Tales of the Sword Coast the expansion pack. But that is a lie. This is an expansion pack - you can NOT play it unless you buy the other! I wrote the company requesting either an installer or my money back and they didn't even give me the simple courtesy of a response. On principle, I refuse to buy the so-called expansion pack now. Their false advertising tricking me into buying this will not be rewarded by me buying the other now.BTW, I went ahead and played Baldur's Gate II: Shadow of Amn, and it is awesome."
3,Computer role-playing grows up again.,"In the late 1980s and the early 1990s, when most AD&D games were still published by SSI in varying Gold Box series, you were pretty much limited to a specific set of interpretations to the AD&D rules. While Baldur's Gate still follows AD&D basic rules (though the second edition, I believe), it has done so in a much more free-flowing, indepedent way. Combat has solidified and become less innately hack-and-slash. If you're a role-playing fan, or you have a soft spot in your heart for the classic Gold Box series that fueled computer role-playing for so long, don't miss this modern descendent."
2,Not as good as I thought,I was using the original black case and was annoyed with it. The PDA turned on and off when it was inside the case because the joystick was pressed and the power button was exposed. Then I decided to try the Palm hard case but it didn't fulfill my expectations-I am returning it.Pros:- Keeps the PDA well protected.- Avoids constant turnings on and off while in the case.- Looks very cool.Cons:- When opened it is very bulky.- The attaching system is awful. Very uncomfortable when detaching the PDA every time I need to Hotsync. This is the strongest con.- It is difficult to access the stylus.- Cannot plug the headphones when the PDA is in the case.
3,"Servers it's purpose, although plastic and flaky","As other reviewers have said, the paint does flake off pretty much completely. It is also plastic, not metal. However, it is strong and has saved my palm many a times when I have dropped it. It's fine for the price, just know that you'll have to spend time scrubbing off the paint so that it doesn't get everywhere."
2,**,"When Snyder hung himself, other homeless activists cynically said, ""Maybe others advocating the homeless will get some credit now."" Snyder was an ego-ridden man who used the homeless cause to get the spot light on himself. If he was so charitable, how come he abandoned his own wife and children? To quote Robert Ringer, ""Martyrs are selfish people with insatiable egos. And adulation is the food that feeds their egos."""
3,Not Universal,Peerless Articulating LCD Wall Arm for 22 inch to 40 inch LCD Screens - Black (SA740P)Needed to purchase another bracket for the back of the TV - those included did not work. More than doubled the cost.
4,works great,"Love how it allows my 32"" TV to move sitting on the stand it hung off the cabinet a bit when it got turned to the best angle to a recliner. now it is safe on the wall moves with a finger works great.the cable management adds to the cable length requirment but looks good. The included adapter to mount my Sharp screwed together with provided screws and washers. The tips of these screws protuded a tiny bit and i filed them off flush.Nice looking, great working piece."
3,"Works, but feels very unsecure!","I mounted this to a cinder block wall in my bedroom and was surprised buy how easy it was to accomplish. I have mounted other lcd's before and this mount gives freedom for mistakes as you can adjust the brackets until everything is lever. By the far the easiest mount ever!The reason for the 3 stars is because once the mount is on the wall and you attach the bracket with the lcd, it feels very loose. The two hooks that are supposed to fit on the mount don't sit all the way and and tv is very wobbly. As far as it being sturdy from the wall, it is, but if you have this thing articulating anything less than 6"" you would wish for something that feels stronger.I ended up buy the Sanus vm400s for only $50 dollars more and it is a 100 times more sturdy and secure!"
1,Terrible game. Waste of time and money.,"I purchased this game because i loved the Emperor's New Groove game by the same company. The Emperor's New Groove game has great graphics, great planning, and hard levels. 102 dalmations was a disappointment in every way. The graphics could not have been much worse and the game was absolutely pointless. You are told exactly what to do everywhere you go. You do not have to think for yourself whatsoever. 3 year olds would be bored. I do not recommend for any age."
3,Deanna Durbin gives her all in her final screen appearance,"""For the Love of Mary"" is significant (especially to Deanna Durbin fans), not for being a great film, but since it would be the last time that Universal's singing sweetheart would ever step in front of the movie cameras. Watching this movie, one wonders why Deanna had to work with such lackluster material. She tries her best in this film (as is evidenced with her spirited rendition of ""Il Barbiere da Saviglia"") although the finished product is anything but extraordinary. Overall, ""For the Love of Mary"" is a cute little film about a White House switchboard operator who must decide between three men (Jeffrey Lynn, Don Taylor and Edmond O'Brien, who all give competent performances)! It is sad to see a performer as talented as Deanna struggling with such thin material, but, all in all, this film is worthwhile viewing."
4,I love Mary!,"Fans of Deanna's who say that her movies got her worse as she got older have opinions I can't agree with-because her last three films are my favorite. Something in the Wind has the best songs, Up In Central Park was her best musical, and For the Love of Mary is my favorite romcom. From the moment it began I was intrigued not only because it was her last film but because it had gotten such bad reviews. Glad I ignored them this film is an absolute delight! It kept me on my toes until the very end! The only thing that disappointed me was the fact that the ending cried for a song, a song that was cut but included as an extended ending. This movie is highly recommended so watch it for the love of Mary already!"
1,"Inconvenient, dangerous, and now broken","My wife and I love our old plastic Hamilton Beach hot water kettle. However, when we re-did our kitchen in stainless steel, we ""upgraded"" to this Bodum since we liked the look and had good experiences with the brand. Boy was this a mistake!Adding water to this kettle is inconvenient. Once the water is hot, because of the kettle's design, there is virtually no way to pour water into your cup without being scalded by steam you keet the little cap on the spout. We always worried about this since it created an obvious danger of the cap popping off and injuring the pourer by spilling hot water. Given the multiple pots of tea we drink daily, this was a major hassle. We were both almost relieved (but outraged) when the kettle broke after ~2 months of use. We have ordered a Chef's Choice and hope for better luck."
1,CHEAP PLASTIC RETAINER BROKE!!!,"I bought this at AutoZone 3/23/11 and it was a hastle from the start. First, I was REQUIRED to spend an extra $30 on Spectre part # 2428 because I needed ONE piece out of it to mount the throttle cable to my valve cover, replacing the stock throttle cable dock. Next, once I installed the throttle cable (which was fairly simple), the plastic end that goes over the chrome sleeve would NOT fit on the aforementioned part (which was THE ONLY logical & reasonable place to mount it), so I had to mickey mouse it with a couple hours of angle grinding. Lastly, on 6/26/11, the P.O.S. plastic connector holding the cable to the pedal failed and left me stranded in 100 degree heat on I-10 heading home. I will NEVER buy another Spectre part again, and I would advise anyone seeking this part to GO WITH ANOTHER COMPANY! Sure, you'll spend more, but having METAL parts COUNTS."
3,Not sure I agree with the across the board 5 stars,I have several meditation CDs including some other ones that use harp music. I found this CD to be uninspired. The music is soothing in a boring way. It certainly is not my favorite. I personally like the 4 CD Global Meditation series put out by the Rainforest Alliance the best.
3,Snappy Dialogue but Story Fails halfway through,"I recently read a Husband in Time, by Maggie Shayne, and while I found the plot unique, and the dialogue well-written, this story failed for me about halfway through when the romance was hijacked by the heroine's small son 'Cody.' I am not opposed to children being in romance novels, but, I hate it when the romantic plot is subsumed by other characters. In this case, the ""Cody attempts to rescue Benjamin"" subplot got a little old.Still, I liked Zach, and enjoyed his dialogue and the attraction between the heroine and himself seemed genuine. I'm giving this 3 stars. I would've liked to see more of the hero and heroine and less of the children's antics."
4,Hinkson keeps it simple!,"If you're a beginner to the game of box lacrosse, this book will get you off on the right foot. Hinkson lays things out in simple format and uses photographs to emphasize his points, plus he tells you how to practice what you learn. Not everyone would agree will Hinkson's approach to the game, but his ideas aren't what one would call controversial either.Fans of the game will enjoy this one too, as they'll find their ability to follow the game improves."
2,Doesn't work,"This is the memory recommended for my Dell Inspiron 3800, but it is not recognised. I suspect the module may be faulty, as I know both sockets on my computer are functional. An interesting side note: I received the shipment today, even though Amazon lists it as ""shipping soon""!"
4,title,"was a great price, tried to order another and price all most doubled, so didnt need it that bad. But is a good product...."
4,"Best backlit keyboard, for the price","Comfortable to use, very quiet to type on. Letter brightness is adjustable, but could stand to be brighter. I didn't want to take a chance on the lettering wearing off like some people talked about, so I followed the advice of another reviewer of putting clear coat nail polish over the keys and it worked like a charm. No signs of letter wear after over a month of heavy use. Very basic, very comfortable keyboard. For the price, it really can't be beat (as back-lit keyboards go). The downside? It didn't come in green, so I had to get a different board for myself to match my current pc motif, but my wife enjoys it along with her matching red Razer mouse.Never had a single problem with this device."
3,Saitek Backlit Keyboard,This keyboard has a red backlight in two intensities. The keys are painted silver. In certain light it is difficult to see with the backlight on. Otherwise it workd as advertised.
4,"As a poet, I used this book for research-useful & inspiring","I wanted to write about Drums, not in the fashion as other poets do, but from a more culturally diverse angle and this book gave me the variations needed to succeed with my attempt. The poem that I wrote (for performance) is entitled ""God is a Drummer"". As a performance poet and author, I wanted to move from my comfort zone of writing, challenging myself on a new level to combine culture and spirituality to educate and inspire others with this subject matter. ""PLANET DRUM"" really helped a great deal. Thanks for a well written and easy to digest work.Kyle Morris of PHYREnEYCE (PHILADELPHIA,PA)"
4,Brilliant for the UNIX Geeks,"Takedown was one of the first books that I read about Cyber criminals. Shimomura's prose is brilliant, specially for a technical person specializing in Computer security. For all those Die-Hard Unix geeks, this should be a revealition about the bugs in the Unix OS and how the hacker exploits the same to invade. The good thing about the book is the way Shimomura explains some of the Unix concepts to people who are not familier with the Technical jargon.There is also a romantic angle added to the book in the form of Julia, Shimomura's girlfriend.All said and done, this is a good read and a must for all computer geeks. Pick it up NOW."
1,For simple minds only,"I've read just about every book on hacking & related topics, and this one really ranks at the very bottom end. Looking for information, perspective, or even technical clues? Forget it. The right choice for the elderly who know nothing about the net and are hooked on those 70ies good-hunts-bad tv serials."
2,Should have been about 400 pages shorter,If he would have left out all the repeated babble about his girlfriend this book might have worth reading. The constant refrences to health food and his attitude problems got on my nerves very quickly. He also refered to distances in meters and kilometers so I was constantly trying to convert that to miles. If you want a good cyber thriller try @Large.
3,Need to be read,"I strongly disagree with many people here.Every one feels that Mr.Shimomura is very egocentric.Even Sherlock Holme's loyal friend and chronicler Dr.Watson felt.What ever the opinion, we like him or not but we cannot ignore him or his services after all he is one of the Internet's greatest detectives.His services are needed very much to fight the Internet Underworld.We all know that every user of the internet is trapped.Anyone,anything and any organization can be hacked.The idea of Internet is good. But unfortunately it is going to be the most dangerous weapon - ONE DISTRIBUTED SUPER COMPUTER -in the hands of the BEAST."
1,"Tepid, Misleading Trash","Tsutomo Shimomura, with help from John Markoff, creates a horribly written and inaccurate bomb with ""Takedown."" Not only is it painfully obvious that Shimomura cannot write, but it is even more painfully obvious that he has one of the biggest egos around. However, the mworst part of ""Takedown"" is its inaccuracies (read: lies). Shimomura lies about ""cybercriminal"" KevinMintnick's exploits. The most crucial one is Shimomura's own interest in the tracking of Mitnick; he reports that he was motivated when Mitnick broke into his computers in San Diego. This is a complete falsehood. Not only is it unsubstatiated, there is no evidence whatsoever that Mitnick ever did. Skip this one; save the brain cells for Jonathan Littman's ""The Fugitive Game."""
1,Don't waste your time on the book--surf out to the website!,"Regardless of the amount of java I ingested, I could not keep myself awake through the boring and impertinent details of an egomaniac's life. Although the techie detective work is itself well-explained and fascinating, the author's ubiquitous tangential ramblings and constant self-aggrandizement grossly detract from the story line. I am appalled at the fact that a New York Times writer allow his name to be printed on one of THE most poorly written books of the 20th century. Much could be fixed by a good editor--or the simple use of a grammar checker that most word processing programs have. Bottom line: surf over to www.takedown.com and get a concise version of the fascinating facts and audio clips with 98% of the author's ego tidily confined to a single link (:-0 gasp!) which one can choose NOT to read!"
2,"Cliff Stoll, he ain't","Stoll (author of _The Cuckoo's Egg_) may have been an egotistical jerk, too, but at least he had enough sense not to write his book that way. Markoff's _Cyberpunk_ isn't bad, so I can only conclude that Shimomura can't perceive how other will see his behavior (truth to tell, I found no evidence that other people exist for him, except to be denigrated or used) and refused to let Markoff take the boring stuff out.I have no sympathy for Mitnick, but by the end of this book, I was just about rooting for him to get away with it, just to take Shimomura down a peg or two."
1,After seeing FREEDOM DOWNTIME and the Mitnick Interview I can't bring myself to buy this book,"I've not read this book simply because I do not want to support the guys who did this to Kevin Mitnick. Also, all the negative reviews pretty say it all.To anyone considering this book... if you really want to read it find a free copy somewhere. Do not pay money for this book.Also, please see the movie ""FREEDOM DOWNTIME"" which can be found on-line and also at www.2600.orgIf you really want to know the Mitnick story get it from the source, from Mitnick himself.Thanks to all the reviewers on here who took the time to warn all of us about this book."
2,Careless Packaging.,My criticism is about the packaging. The bulbs (in their boxes) were carelessly dropped into a carton with a couple of plastic balloons tossed in. It was amazing that ONLY ONE was broken. I wrote to Amazon but havent heard back. HOW DO I GET A REPLACEMENT?
1,Awful....,"I was very disappointed. While I am a fan of Ryan Dunn there wasn't enough of him in the dvd to really make it worthwhile and Don Vito's drunken antics were repulsive.It seemed as though they were trying for a return to the ""good"" old days of the Steve-O DTTAH tours, but without Steve-O. Despite the description of the dvd, he isn't in this film whatsoever, although his old cohorts of Nick Dunlap and Carolla are.Bad. Just.....bad."
5,Replacement Mixet Stem/Valve,"This was a great deal, came quick even though it was a hard to find part. It also was a great deal. Returned faucet to like new condition."
5,AWESOME,THIS CD IS UNREAL I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. iT IS THE BEST OF THE BEST SONGS THAT TEMERARIOS HAS MADE. I AM AN AMERICAN AND I LOVE THE MUSIC THAT TEMERARIOS PLAYS EXPICALLY YA MI VOY PARA SIEMPRE
4,"Good garage radio, price was right",Good price for a radio while working in the garage on weekends. As a non-audiophile I just play my burned CDs and listen to AM radio & am happy with performance. Remote and iPod support come in handy. It does not bother me that the unit looks like a 1977 Samsung.
1,Stopped working!,"Sounded fine, but after about 2 mos. or so (after point when it could be returned to Amazon!), stopped powering up. Called support, and after half hour on line got return number. Had to spend $25 to ship it to Texas and now waiting for word. I think Sony should pay shipping when their product konks out so early. Beware of this item. Forsyte."
1,A real piece of crap.,This thing lasted 7 weeks before it could no longer play cd's. A complete piece of junk.
2,MP3 Playback is disappointing,"I've had it for a month now and I like the sound quality when it plays CD's and radio. However MP3 devices I connected do not produce enough volume or quality of sound. That feature was a main reason why I selected CMTBX1 as I am sick and tired of cleaning CD's and their going bad over time. It is not bad enough to return, but not good enough to recommend."
5,Totally Awesome Once Again,"I'm a total Fiery Furnaces fan. This cd is just as awesome as all of their cds. Thanks, Fiery Furnaces, for bringing your insights & talents into our world."
2,Betty Boop - The Vintage Collection,"This is a nice DVD, and contains some classic cartoons - Betty Boop's Bamboo Isle and Old Man of the Mountain are particularly of merit. [...]"
2,the thing about prime is this,"the thing about prime streaming is this; as usual the selection is comprised either of impossibly bad fliks or of those the entire english speaking world has already seen, and most of the rest."
1,Scheisser of the Dead,"This review was written by my fiance and I was to stunned in horror to type.I volunteer to be the sole bastion of reason here.This movie is god-awful. Plain and simple. The characters are blatantly idiotic, and this is by horror movie standards which makes them dumber than downs syndrome children. Let me ask you this? What do you do when people start eating each other? The obvious answer is to grab a weapon and start the melee, but not if you're in europe. If your in europe (where self-defence is outlawed) then your best option is to spend the first ten minutes of a zombie movie worrying about where you will pee. Oh, and his girlfriend is a furry and he sleeps in her bear suit.The movie was idiotic at best, war crime (and I mean fourth reich bad) at worst."
2,Very dissapointing,"First it is in subtitles, I did not know it before I ordered it. Not alot of action and quite boring in parts. Definetely pass on this one"
5,Excellent and Child Friendly,"As a parent I have struggled with young children's television programming. Too often, shows that cater to children are not child appropriate (mild sexual innuendo, crude joking, and parents are always idiotic and usually wrong). I am happy to say that I have found a show that I approve of.The Busy World of Richard Scarry: Everyday There's Something New is a pleasant relief for parents. Not only is this series free of all that is bad about modern children's television (think Rugrats and Spongebob), but it even has better animation.This July 2010 DVD release consists of 3 DVDs with approximately 13.5 hours of video.It's a great buy!"
4,Good!,"I thought it would be just a little bit better though... The graphics are funny but very well done. Its an entertaining game for anyone of any age. Its good a cool cartoon feature too. If you like scooby, you'll want this. But, don't be suprised if your a little dissapointed. For example, you don't really ""solve"" the mystery on your own. You find items that show you the answer. ENJOY!"
5,Terrific,"A very scholarly but readable and witty tome about the British Empire, concentrating on economic and technological factors in the course of its development. Full of surprising insights and interesting facts."
1,short life,This item has a very short life-span. With normal wear and tear it lasted about 3 weeks... really not impressed.
1,"How it works? Hell, How do you load the batteries? No instructions!",This is piss poor marketing! No instructions and no clue as to where the battery compartment is located or how to insert batteries!
1,If you like stories riddled with spelling and grammatical errors...,"[...]If that sounded sexy, amazing, or riveting to you, then you'll love this book. [...]This would be better if it were a story written for junior high. Alas, it is not. I gave it a 1-star rating because he deserves that much at least - he has the guts to publish it and let other people read it.I just had to warn people about this book."
2,Some good ideas...,"I think this show is a case of some comedians with good ideas, but not enough to make an entire show. To me at least, most of the best stuff is crammed into the first episode, and from there its pretty lame. It seems that the team of Scheer, Huebel, Aziz, and Wollner lack restraint, allowing some genuinely funny bits to drag on far too long (the Mother and Son Moving Company skit). Others had funny premises, but were just poorly executed (the To Catch A Predator skit), and ended up not being funny. I found myself tired after the first three episodes. There are a few good ones, the blood oath one and the one where they are all trying not to fall asleep first for example, but most of it is simply not funny. I was expecting more and was truly disappointed."
3,These are just ok,"I wanted a pair of trendy cute slip-ons. However, when I received them, they weren't nearly as cute as the pictures make them out to be. They have a really bulbous round toe, my boyfriend (lovingly) called them ""clown shoes"" the first time he saw me wear them!I got these in the black and red floral print and the red looks understated in the pics but is actually fire engine red in real life. Sadly, I don't wear these to work like I wanted to but they are fine for running to the mail box or the grocery store.As far as quality of the shoe, it's a nice shoe. Well made, pretty comfy, no complaints about that. Just wish it were cuter and not clowny."
3,"Works ok, But","I was never able to fully restore. The only thing that really worked was to re-install XP and then do the recovery from there.The results then work ok as long as I never use any of the driver options, including the ""recommended"".All in all, better than Ghost, but not by very much."
2,"Lame game play, very outdated compared to today's games","This game was a major disappointment because I made the mistake of thinking it would be comparable to today's games.. This was made in the 90's and it's a very simplistic game comparable to most of today's free online gaming websites. The character's voice over clips are funny but they are limited so you start to hear repeats very quickly, which gets annoying.. Save your money on this one."
1,Too far out for me!,"while I found the suggestion that we ""diet"" from negative thoughts about ourselves to be valid and very helpful, Sondra (unfortunately) goes off the New Age deep-end with her suggested ""prayers"" and chants to the Great Haji Ally Sheedy whoever..........??????!!!! who is this entity supposed to be? anyway, I found many things to be useful but the bottom line? DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
3,Yawn! Get The Longest Journey instead. . .,"After reading all the reviews for this game, and seeing all of the awards it has won, I had really high expectations that weren't met. While I agree with other reviewers on the amazing quality of graphics and sound, the puzzles were just boring and way too easy. I don't like impossible puzzles, but come on! A little challenge would have been nice. Also, the pace was too slow. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen, but it never did. The ideas were wonderful, and gorgeously executed--i love the concept of automatons--but I wish they had done more with them.I played this game shortly after playing The Longest Journey, which was an awesome game on all levels. Syberia just didn't hold a candle to it."
4,Syberia,This game is all fun. The graphics are state of the art. The locations are stunning with rich details. Be careful not to spend days trying to move to the next location because you will get stumped. This is one of my complaints. The other is that the game crashes often which is why it only get 4 stars overall. But don't let those minor details stop you from buying this game. For the price I say it's a very good buy and should be part of your collection.
3,Crashes ruin it,"This game is gorgeous! If you can overlook the fact that you have to run across the entire world, back and forth, back and forth, asking the same people the same darn question over and over (because they are lieing to you only you don't know it)its a lot of fun. Just remember to save after EVERY move you make because the game crashes on newer systems CONSTANTLY. Even after downloading the patches, I'm STILL having problems. Oh, and then theres the fact that your ""saved"" game doesn't actually save unless you reload it. I had to redo the first level 3x before I figured that little gem out.Of course, the fact that I actually redid the first level 3x proves that its addictive & a great game overall. Or maybe I'm just really determined..."
4,"A bit linear, but awesome storyline","As the title suggests, the game was very linear, and often environments were not interactive unless they had to be to progress. In this way the game kind of steers you to where you need to go, with many beautiful but useless landscapes in between. In this way it was reminiscent of Myst where you solve the puzzle and move on, rather than giving you freedom of movement to explore a rich and free world. But the Syberia story and characters are so original and engrossing that I really enjoyed it anyway, as if watching a movie, and I am looking forward to playing Syberia II. I just wish they made games like the Tex Murphy series from the days of Amiga and DOS, but this game is definitely recommended for its originality and beauty; you won't be bored."
3,One of the best half-games you'll ever play,"The title of my review says it all. The game is beautiful, the concept is interesting, there's decent character development, and the puzzles aren't insanely difficult (I've had a harder time with some of the Nancy Drew games). But, just as you're really getting into the story and starting to get excited about what happens next, BANG! Done. Just done. The last couple of chapters really get one hooked on the idea of figuring it all out, too bad it's over so abruptly. My husband and I actually said ""What?!?!? No way!!!"" when the credits came on the screen. And then we sat dumbfounded and watched the credits, just in case, but to no avail.I still give it 3 overall stars because it was good while it lasted, and worth playing.I have not yet played Syberia 2, so I don't know how well they fit together. But you may want to keep the second one close so when the first game ends, it's not such a frustrating shock."
4,Almost MYST-like,"For MYST fans Syberia may be a good prelude to Parable/Mudpie, for others its an excellent problem solving game with tremendous graphics. The puzzles are not difficult and the ending sets up for SYBERIA 2 which hopefully will allow a first person viewpoint and a 360 degree environment."
2,Disappointed,"This game should not be in the Adventure category. It is a puzzle solving game with good to excellent graphics. There is no player involvement other than ""point and click"". There is no suspense. The game is more suited to children in the 10 to 13 age group than to the 13 to adult group. ""Shooters"" are not my thing but this game is simply boring. I gave it 2 stars only on the merits of the graphics."
1,Holster doesn't hold,This holster does not lock the phone into place. The slighest bump releases the phone and sends it flying off. I would not recommend it at all.
2,Average Fare,"Just an Average entertainer. I would say the strongest points of Avatar are:1) Good acting by Sam, Weaver and that Bully General.2) Despite being from Down Under, I could not discern Sam's Aussie Accent. This idiotic accent is what makes me hate Garbage from Down-Under like Botox Aunty Nicole, Crackpot Crowe and Pinched-face Nanny Cate!Bad Points:1) It might not have been 3-D for all I care. It is really a déjà-vu time!2) Not Entertaining enough, I was squirming in the first half, though 2nd half was much better or was it the chocolate éclair ?Don't feel bad if you CAN'T watch the movie for some reason. No great shakes and you may wait for the DVD release. You don't HAVE to watch the movie now, really you don't."

1,Why did they force me to buy a DVD with Blu-Ray?,"I bought the movie for a birthday gift. The birthday girl really wanted it on Blu-Ray. Cool. A win-win for everyone... except that I had to buy a DVD that I will never, ever watch because the family now has the Blu-Ray! And this is the ONLY way I could get the Blu-Ray version! I haven't even removed the cellophane wrapper -- in fact, I haven't even seen the movie -- and I am still going to give this product a one-star rating.I don't care about the reviewers that slam this review because I'm not reviewing the movie itself. I don't care about the reviewers that slam this review because I'm not reviewing the quality of the video itself, or the audio, or the price, or the cool cardboard sleeve. Slam me or don't slam me. I'm giving this item one star because of the marketing ploy behind the sale of the movie. And every time I am forced to buy one item to get another, I will also rate it in a similar manner."
1,Mixed Message,"Am I the only one who is deeply disturbed by the use of constant violence in this film by everyone from the animals to all of the people, human and non-human, as part of the storytelling to illustrate that violence is not the answer?"
5,AVATAR,"Im my personal opinion....This is the most beautifull film i've ever seen,....Rich in decor, story, everything is GREAT about that film....I've seen it in 3D in theater, and about 6 times at home so far"
5,Avatar Extended Collector's Edition Review,"This is one of those must have dvd's for all Avatar lovers and Fans! There are many extra, deleted, and extended scenes that were not shown in the original release. This dvd pack is just excellent! The graphics are Great. One might have felt they were missing something in the original theatrical release and that's because they actually were, but after watching this extended collectors edition you'll feel filled in on what was missing and thourghly fall back in love with Avatar. Sit back and watch as you are resubmerged into the world of Pandora!"
4,Avatar Blu ray,"Watched the movie in 3D and just had to have it ASAP. It seems this movie is a love or hate phenomenon! Some forget it's JUST a movie, perhaps it's because people in America can't distinguish the difference anymore between reality and fiction? I digress, played the new release Blu ray last night and was satisfied, but not ecstatic. There is no way any format other than 3D can really do this movie full justice. I was a bit taken back thinking this might possibly be the director's cut (What was I thinking) only to find there will be another release for $34.00 for that.The movie held up, as it did with the first 3D viewing on theme and interest, of course, but it did not have the same impact as 3D. Some might wonder what 3D verse Blu Ray or DVD means? It means that 3D actually appeared far less CGI and more real than the release on Blu ray that demoted it to more of a cartoon appearance; in my humble opinion, hence a star lose."
5,Blu-ray and DVD... good deal...,"If you liked the movie and are considering getting it, you can't go wrong with the Blu-ray and DVD combo for $19.99 on Amazon.I do however recommend an HDTV and a blu-ray player for this movie to get the full experience."
5,I'll keep this short...,"There are so many reviews out for this movie it would be a waste for me to attempt to write a review of it. All I can say is that it is the best movie I've seen this year and quite possibly the best movie I've ever seen. To clarify that statement and avoid being flamed by someone who did not enjoy it as much as me, I offer this statement. When I say 'best', I mean more that it could be my personal favorite, not necessarily 'best' in a quantifiable and measurable manner. Anyways, I will surely be buying this movie on blu-ray when it releases. And I almost never buy movies, so that's saying something."
4,Not as good as the big screen,Looking to expand the 3D collection and had seen this at the movie theatre. Not as good as the big screen but still a good addition to the collection.
1,Typical Hollywood flash and little substance ...,"Regardless of the milking of the bad blue-ray version or whatever, this movie was meh. Not sure whereall the hype came from, other than this seems to be the new thing with hollywoodish flicks these days.The script(dialogue)itself is quite predictable and just bad in places, especially the military banter andI really could not feel much for the anime' eyed blue skinned earthy klan. The whole movie felt like watchinga video game with all it's computerized special effects and flash. Overall just too predictable as to where itwas going. Plenty of cliche's throughout. After seeing it, made me wonder how hype takes off anymore when abig budgeted and promo'd to death--movie comes out. Great though for the dumbing down of viewers everywhere."
2,"Excellent Movie, Poor Packaging","This of course is a great movie, which I've seen dozens of times. However, the packaging though eye-catching is poor. All three discs managed to get scratched being that it's placed on cardboard pullout on their poorly designed package. Be wary buying this version because I also know quite a few people who also experienced scratched discs due to the poor packaging."
3,Feeling ripped off.,"I will start with the good. Picture quality is great on Blu-ray...The bad. Box states DTS-HD but when I play it it plays in old DTS sounds good but not great like many other films on Blu-ray-NO SPECIAL FEATURES AT ALL, nothing, ZIP, NADA.-Great filming good story but totaly slanted for liberal anti military/corporate message.-Be real here, who knows people in the military that act like these guys?That is why I gave it a low rating. It is amazing to watch and I have never seen CGI that looks so real but I feel like I am in some anti American political rally.I say watch it, but dont take it so serious, and you losers that want to go to Pandora someone should sell you one way tickets their!"
2,"cool effects, zero creativity.","Ok i know that everyone says that Avatar was ""the greatest move ever."" not even close. and more importantly, it's being brought back into theaters with new footage! talk about a dick move james cameron. seriously, just put it on the dvd if it means that much to you.Avatar was visually very nice, all the pretty and shiny colors are quite distracting, then you realize the plot. which is prety much fern gully. with no music.....it's little big man meets fern gully. sorry avatar fans, its the same crap on a shinier backdrop."
1,A Rip-Off,"This release of AVATAR is a complete rip-off and waste of time. James Cameron has already said that this version will be a barebones (movie only) release. He has already said that no earlier than Thanksgiving he will release an ultra version:*3-D*All deleted scenes reinserted into the movie, including, supposedly, the sex scene*Tons of bonus features and extrasHe also went on to say that just before this bluray release, he will rerelease this version into the theaters for a limited engagement.Save you money. Buy the better version when it comes out."
5,Really Great Movie,My wife and I watch the Avatar movie and thought it was a really Great movie. Alot of action and fast pace parts.
4,AWESOME GIFT,Friend bought this for me for christmas and i was super happy. but if you're wanting a live action of Pocahontas this is pretty much the movie for you.. it's not really worth the money to get the like what half hour of extra stuff. although a great collectors thing. so
3,I suggest waiting,"A wonderful movie, but I guess I was little sad to learn that there are absolutely no special features. With such an innovated process to creating them film, I feel that some behind the scenes stuff would be a given. If you can, I would wait till November and get the special edition. But if you can't wait the movie is definitely worth the price."
3,"Fair, that's all.","A Pokahontas-like story with superior digital technology. We've seen the opposite gender version in ""Dances with Walf"" also. Though visiualy very entertaining, it still reminded me of a high end computer game. The whole movie is more of a state-of-art tech than a piece of art. I certainly enjoyed watching it, but not surprised for its loss of the academic claim."
2,"Great visuals, very boring story.","The 3-D visuals and other special effects were spectacular. The story line and character development were extremely weak in my opinion. I found the Na'vi to be childlike at best and irritating at worst and found myself cheering for the corporation. The only character worth watching in the entire film was Colonel Quatrich (sp). Overall this film was a huge dissapointment for me as I had looked forward to it for a long time. I will not be purchasing this or any other edition of Avatar. Alice in Wonderland was a far better film, I'll save my funds for that one."
4,"The Movie Was Great, Worth Extra For Blu Ray, But The Rest Is Not Worth Paying For.","The Movie Was Great, Worth Extra For Blu Ray, But The Rest Is Not Worth Paying For.Avatar (Three-Disc Extended Collector's Edition + BD-Live) [Blu-ray]"
5,3D at home,I recently purchased a Samsung 3D TV. The 3D is better at home than it was in the Theater. Avatar was great in 3D.
1,"Thanks Mr Cameron, but no thanks!","Oh no! Here we go again. A movie studio shamelessly milking a good movie! Come on, Fox! Didn't Avatar make you guys like a Bizillion dollars in the theaters? And Mr Cameron, why would you sit by and let these guys release this so called 2 disc Blu - ray DvD combo with no special features? I mean nothing, nada, ziltch. Don't the fans deserve better? Instead, Fox will release an ultimate edition in November. What the hell is that about? I just bought the combo pack ; believe me, I will be taking it back to Target early tomorrow morning. If you care about getting more bang for your buck and care about the extra stuff,stay away from this edition and wait a few months. If you really want to see this movie at home, Rent It! Get your dollar bill and make a red box happy. That's what I plan to do."
3,Could have been so much more.,"Ok right up front the CGI was awesome, the best I have ever seen and the whole avatar concept was brilliant, but that's about all the praise I have for the film.The detractors were the preachy plot that was so filled with banal clichés, 3D effects that were less than stellar, over-the top acting that seemed to be there to re-enforce the tired clichés and an overall condescending preachy message that truly made me feel I was being spoken down too.In the end I came away disappointed I wanted to be entertained instead I sat through a sermon, I wanted to me mentally challenged instead I had a highly formulaic movie that held no surprises. This movie could have been so much more.3 Stars for the CGI and overall concept, probably should rate it only 2 but don't want to be attacked too much."
1,Avatar movie,"I didnt know before i bought this that the avatar blu-ray had problems. It dosen't play on all blu-rays, so i contacted amazon, so that i could get a refund, and never heard anything back. so i am stuck with this movie and cant even watch it."
3,Great movie but a disappointing dvd/blu-ray release,(Edited: The price has already gone down slightly so it's slightly more worth it.)The movie is great but this featureless release for the price of a fully featured blu-ray isn't worth it. Wait until the fully featured version goes on sale in a few months and get your money's worth. Rent this if you can't wait or can afford to buy this movie twice.
2,One of the dopiest movies every made,"This is one of the dopiest movies ever made. Sure, the special effects are cool, so that gives it a 2+ star. Otherwise this movie is full of stereo-typical groups of people, military, evil corporations, the entire enchilada. Some of the stuff is so stupid you only wonder, but people seem to enjoy that these days. The only thing missing is Tarzan swinging through the jungle to save the Avatars. Oh, the chicks will like it because it does have a love theme chicky flicky, oh joy."
5,Double/Triple Dip Criticism Unfounded.,"I really don't understand why there so much backlash regarding this new version. The various versions that would be available in the future was never a secret and if you preferred to purchase the movie before all the special features were completed how is the anyone's fault but your own? All the studio did was to make a plain Jane version available for those who did not want to wait. I will say I am a little surprised that the 3D version was not released along with this version, but maybe there's more work to do on the 3D version, such as 2D to 3D conversion of extra material (the making of type stuff). Anyway, most people (myself included) do not have 3D TVs yet, so for us it's a moot point. If the various versions that would be available were kept a secret then people would have justification in being annoyed, but this was not the case."
5,Like the original? Then you will LOVE This,"Over 6 hours of entertainment. Optional beginning and extra scenes throughout movie. Glad I bought this and gave the original single disk to my adult son and his family. Might be my imagination, but this seems to be at a higher definition than before. Great packaging too."
5,World View,"I purchased this movie as a gift for my cousin after she and I viewed my own DVD of this film. It has such powerful messages and such fantastic graphics that it is definitely a collector's item. While she and I don't always agree on the movies we see, this is one that gets ""hands down"" approval and praise from us both. I heartily recommend this film for everyone. There are some important messages that we all could benefit from in it."
3,Avatar,"Have not been able to enjoy this movie in Blu-ray yet. It will not play in my Sony Blu-Ray player. I did all the updates and it still does not play, so I can't rate the movie yet."
3,Bare,"[some time ago] This is just a couple of discs in a box. No extras of any kind, just the movie. If you're one of those people who really likes special editions of things, skip this.Why purchase the DVD version when it's included for free with the Blu disc? [hand on chin][revision] So now they have a new release with all the ridiculous extras. Personally, I don't care to partake of such intense fanaticism. I can't be the only one still satisfied with the original Blu/DVD combo release..."
2,Avatar unhype,"I did not see the film in the theaters. Maybe 3D and IMAX could have saved it for me. The DVD was a joke, a very poor imitation of star wars aliens. I did not finish the DVD, put it back on the shelf."
5,"Beautiful, relevant but not the whole package","This is quite possibly the most visually beautiful movie I've seen - the message of the movie is relevant as we all strive to be more 'green' but the DVD as a whole was a big disappointment. It's only the film, no extras, no 3-D option either. Had I know that the movie was being released again later this year, I would have waited..."
5,Absolutely amazing in 3D,I must admit I was a little skeptical about the quality of the 3D version. I was pleasantly surprised I felt as if I was in the movie myself I loved it!
3,"Movie is fine, its getting to it","The movie is as good as it was in theaters and better with the added footage. However, if your blue-ray player is more than a few months old there is good chance you will have to update its software in order to play this. Depending on your equipment this might be easy but for me it was nearly impossible. Roll the dice on this one."
4,great movie,"so i finally watch the movie after all the good things i hear about it, and iam not disappointed. great movie, blu ray makes this movie look really good in your hdtv."
4,Ignore the politics enjoy the flick,"Speaking as a disabled Jarhead with mobility issues, the main character struck a chord. Speaking as someone who grew up in the pristine wilderness of Montana, I'm a conservationist who doesn't much care for the radical eco-nazi Green movement, but I can relate to the ecological theme far more than you urbanites out there.I don't have to buy into the propaganda to enjoy a movie with a message, even when it resorts to gross steriotypes. After all, the steriotypes do apply to certain corporations. Not all of them, but some of the multi-national corps are real stinkers. They operate above the laws of any given nation .. and, interstingly enough, that was the main theme of this movie.As to the technical merits of the film ... well, I've got sense enough to enjoy a movie without picking the thing apart on technical merits. If a better version comes out later, I'll buy it. Until then .. pass the popcorn."
4,Great Movie not so great 3D,"I just bought a new 3D tv and wanted to try AVATAR in 3D but it's good overall, but not many 3D scenes that you can really tell the difference."
1,Eye Candy,"After all the hype about how good this movie was, I was greatly disappointed. This movie is the biggest box-office champion of all time now ? Really ?? Why is that ? It's certainly not because of the story (which is a retread of 'Dances with Wolves', only with blue aliens instead of red indians). So I guess the reason is because of ""how"" it looked, which really doesn't paint too good a picture on Americans' intellect, does it ? I've always believed that good story writing/telling is more important than ""how"" you present the story. You can present it in life-like, hologramed, 3-D all you want, but if the story is second rate no fancy presentation is going to cover that up. While I can appreciate Cameron's ability to push the technical barriers of film-making, I wish he would have had just as much fervor in writing the story. I have no desire to sit down and watch this movie again."
3,great graphics but I don't know how it broke all records.,"i can't believe that this movie broke all records. yes, everything was finely made, graphics etc., but explain to me how it broke all records. it was probably 90% computer generated. i can do stuff like that too."
5,Avatar,It was purchased as a gift. My friend said it was good quality and loved it. She watches it over and over.
4,"I Would've Preferred Special Features As Well, But....","I'm not sure how you can rate the movie as one star w/o the special features, but would've given it 5 stars if it had the features. Do you buy the movie for the movie, or the special features? If it was just special features, but no movie, would you have given it 4 stars?As for complaining about the studio ""double-dipping"" by releasing a basic set now and a feature-rich set in a few months: DUH! Studios are a BUSINESS. If you just want the movie w/o the special features, buy it now. If you want the special features, wait. If you want to watch the movie now, rent it! I'm happy that the movie is available now. I'm not interested in the extra features. I watched it on Blu-Ray last night and thoroughly enjoyed it.How many different ways have Beatles songs been re-packaged? Next subject :)"
5,Good,It is almost new and had no issues with it. Packing is also original. No complaints. Received it in less than two week of purchase.
5,Everything you would want from Avatar,"This DVD set is great and is made even better with Blu-Ray disc technology. The set comes witht he original theatrical edition, the re-release extended edition, and another separate extended edition. Also, the set comes with all the extra features, behind the scenes, and the making of information you would ever want! You can only get the behind the scenes features with this extended collectors edition, the standard Blu-ray DVD comes with no behind the scenes information. Save your money from buying the normal edition and spend a little more and get this extended edition, you will not be sorry!"
3,great blu ray,great quality blu ray but I have some issues with the brighness and colors. I think the colors and the picture qulaity are not great at times. I played this in both my samsung tv and also on 150' projector screen. not as good as when I compare this to other blu rays like spider man etc. may be it is due to 1:1.78 (16:9) format.
1,DRM issues,Out of the box refused to play in my blue ray player. Did research online and appears to be an issue with the DRM copy protection.Still unable to get the disc to work with my blue ray player.I paied money for this and can't watch it. Next time i will jsut download it.
1,"hook, line and stinker","The problem with this movie is the fact that Cameron took what could have been an epic story in an imaginative environment and defiled that promise for his jackbooted, hamhanded attempt at ramming a load of liberal America hating propaganda down our throats. Quite simply this movie is a thinly disguised, steaming pile of ""IT"". The plot is predictably bad and the special effects did nothing to alleviate the painful lack of anything even remotely intellectually stimulating. The icing on this fecal masterpiece is how many folks joyfully swallowed this in whole... hook, line and stinker. Now THAT is truly distressing."
2,NOT WHAT YOU WANT,AVATAR is a movie for blu-ray; but this poor edition is not worth the cost. The image is good; but the DVD (included) in not so bad. The only reason to buy this is the 3 extra bucks you are paying for the blu-ray but this edition is worthless
2,"Full price, half features","The studios are thriving on people's willingness to buy the same darned thing over and over.This time we are getting the price of a full summer blockbuster release, but we are missing all of the special features. Often studios release two versions up front, including a less expensive version with just the movie. Now we get to pay full price and not get the features, but have the honor of paying even more for it all later.I'm getting tired of this. I do want to see making-of features for a film like this so there's no way they're getting the money from me on this one.The film is beautiful. The studio marketing is very, very ugly."
3,Not my thing,"This is a movie for kids but it does have some adult themes. Its special effects are good, and its probably aimed tword enviromentalists."
5,buy it,it was great i seen it in the movies to i did not think the effects would be good but they turned out great
1,missing disc!!!,"We were halfway through the movie, went to put in the 2nd disc, AND IT'S NOT THERE!!! We are past the return date, so we are left with HALF of a movie. Just wonderful (sarcastic)"
3,Avatar 3 disc extended collector's edition,"I was disappointed in that it did not show the entire extended version, just outtakes of what the extended version that was shown in the theaters showed. I could have bought a regular version with the special outtakes for a lot less money."
5,Awesome,Great movie! Looking forward to a second one. A long running series wouldn't be a bad idea. I really enjoy this type of movies and can watch them over and over again.
5,Outstanding!... It really surprised me!,"The character's almost appear as if they could really be in an existing culture of they're own... I wasn't expecting it to be that good, boy was I wrong... now... if I could get the darn download. But,you must have an imagination and an open mind just like any other PC generated movie. And like another person mentioned... it does have a plot. It worked for me."
3,Get the 3D and/or Special Edition,"I'm not knocking this movie. I loved the movie and would have given the DVD a better rating, but....If you just want to see the movie, sure get this to satisfy your curiosity. Keep in mind this ISN'T the 3D version. There are NO extras.I saw this in the theater in 3D and must tell you, I can't imagine seeing it any other way. This movie was meant to be experienced in 3D and thank goodness home technology is making that possible. It's a completely different experience and one well worth waiting for. A great movie best seen in all it's glory (hence the three stars for the stripped down version)."
1,Avatar 3D,"$175 Realy -Best of luck, see you at $25. My message was easily delivered in under 25 words, however le me be clear - late release, too expensive, too little value, what in the world are you thinking!"
5,Avatar on Blu-Ray,"I have no idea why so many people are hating on this movie. It's just a movie people! It's meant for entertainment, it's not supposed to change your life or anything! And for entertainment purposes, it does a great job. This movie hits the trifecta of everything I look for in a Blu-Ray....great story, great picture, great sound. No extras?? Who cares? Do you seriously buy a movie for the extras? If so, then you are a joke of a movie fan. If you are like me and buy the movie for, I don't know, THE MOVIE...then pick this copy up. I don't care about any ""Special Editions"" or ""Director's Cuts"" or whatever because I'm not going to buy them anyway. I wanted the movie and that's exactly what I got.For those who have compatibility issues with this flick, GET A BETTER BLU-RAY PLAYER YOU CHEAP M'FERS!!!:p"
5,Love this movie!,"I saw the non 3D version of this movie when it came out and absolutely loved it. Waited to purchase the collector's edition on Blu-ray and got a really good deal on amazon. I must say this movie looks better to me on my HD tv and Blu-ray player then it did in the movies! The colors are crisp and vibrant. I love the behind the scenes and making of this movie. If you are a fan of this movie, then this is a must have. In my opinion, Blu-ray is the only way to watch this movie! Enjoy!"
4,Awesome Movie,This is such a great movie! And the two disc pack allows us to keep one at home and use the other in the car. I was just disappointed that there were no special features.
5,EXCELLANT,AS LONG AS YOU KNOW HOW TO UPGRADE YOUR BLUE RAY SYSTEM YOU WILL LOVE THIS PRODUCT. WONDERFUL MOVIE ON BLUE RAY. WE HAD TO UPGRADE OUR SYSTEM 2 TIMES TO BE ABLE TO WATHCH THOUGH. I LOVE AVATAR. IT IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER WATCHED.
1,Only a special effects flick,"Avatar is the example of a film that got by on only its special effects.The characters were so flat they weren't even two dimensional. They were completely predictable and stereotypical. The bad guys were so formulaic they were mere parodies. Come on, couldn't Cameron make real bad bad-guys? Heck, I've had elementary school teachers more evil and heinous than Avatars antagonists! The ""good guys"" were just lame. None of the characters had any depth whatsoever.The plot was about as simplistic and predictable as its possible to get. Godzilla movies show more creativity and intricacy in their plot structure."
5,Avatar DVD,"This was a great movie in the theaters, but the home version is just as good minus the 3D effects. Great sound quality and good imaging. I watch it over and over and see something different every time. Good morals for the children showing them how we must have a respect for nature and people who are different than us. Some violence with the destruction of the planet's forest hunting for precious material. Not for small children. Adults will love it."
2,"wow-ee, special effects!","Claptrap. Preach non-violence for two hours and then resolve the main conflict through an orgy of violence. Do as we say, not as we do.The special effects were pretty good. The ""Star Wars"" special effects were pretty good in 1977. We'll look back on ""Avatar"" in a few years and cringe. A film that has nothing but special effects to recommend it is condemned to a very short life."
3,Good,"The Movie it's self was ok...however James Cameron is Foul for stealing and purchasing the title away from the Actual AVATAR last airbender Series and Movies...I felt it was visually stunning however it better be coming from James Cameron..This DVD purchased from this user..was not accuarate..It was only a Single Blu Ray DVD and with No features..only the movie.The User However, did contact me and explain the details provided for the dvd were all that was available to best explain which item he had..The product was inaccurate and delivery date was as well....i give this user and its dependability 4/5 thoughI would purchase from this user again as well as recommend them to others, due to INTEGRITY"
1,"No Extras, won't work without firmware update!","I just bought this movie today, popped it in the Blu-ray player for the family and found out I need a @#$%ing firmware update from Sony to play it. I went to their website to download the update only to find there is only a windows version. So now I have to wait a week for Sony to send me a CD. Thanks James a heads up on your new security software would have been nice.As most of you know this movie has no extras, but it does come with a fantastic DVD version. Why anyone would want an extra copy of this movie on DVD when they bought the Blu-ray version is beyond me. Maybe James could have included the security update in lieu of his less superior version of the movie."
1,x.x,"I guess I should have read the articles first, but generally when I make a purchase of a movie I don't. Apparently Sony blocks Avatar from being watched without a special upgrade thingy that my player doesn't support. So now I can't watch the movie and I can't return it because Amazon doesn't accept open items returned. X.X"
1,Blu Ray Disappointment,"I pre-ordered this Blu-Ray and was disappointed with the complete lack of any features. The movie might be decent, but I feel quite abused by the studio.I was also annoyed by the on-screen display during pausing or forwarding or rewinding and the difficulty in figuring out Which of the three options was actually highlighted due to poor color choice.I was quite surprised to see a strange error come-up while navigating to the main menu the first time I attempted to view the movie in my PS3.I don't know who did the final Quality Assurance on this presentation, but it is not very well though-out. I don't understand why all the other reviewers rated this BluRay so high unless they just liked the sound and the picture quality (which are both quite good).I guess I could most closely describe this as if I had bought a book that had a terrific story but all the pages fell out after I read it once."
2,Are you kidding me?,"People are you serious over 2.7 billion worldwide? My hope for good cinema taste is dead. Awesome special effects, terrible acting, terrible plot terrible story. DId anyone else feel like they were watching Ferngully? Cause I did I was waiting for Batty to start rapping. The most overhyped movie I have probably ever seen. I cant believe so many fell for it. Wasnt the worst movie ever but far from the best."
5,codiny's reveiw,"I'm 12 years old, and I have seen a ton of animated movies. Avatar just blew me away. Not just the animations, but the meaning of the story.The Na'vi live on Pandora which when we find out about it we go in for guess what .....yes money. To do that we have to destroy their planet , but the Na'vi fight back. When some humans join them , and convense them to fight back.Even without three d its great , and I still felt like I was there in Pandora fighting.My grandpa was angry about the whole worshiping tree thing , but I heard on the radio that the director had been interviewed , and said "" I didn't mean to be non- Christian , and any way its just a movie.I think the meaning of it is fight for what's yours. I feel this movie really set standards for other movies, so I give it five stars."
3,What I think of Avatar,The movie can be sumed up in one little blip. A science fiction based Dances with wolves dripping with political overtones. Looks great I will give Weta that.
3,Avatar Blue Ray,"Avatar on blue-ray is very good visually, But I do feel a little cheated. I tried to cancel this order but was too late as they had already readied it for shipping.It turns out that Cameron is re-releasing Avatar this Summer and is releasing a ""director's cut"" with out-takes and a digital copy this November.If you want to see this NOW then by all means, get this disk. It is a very good DVD with a crisp transfer and great sound.But I do feel that I should have waited, I will buy the next release to get the extra's. It's kinda like when they release Jackson's King Kong and the 3 months later, released a directors cut with many more extra's.How much mining of my wallet can they expect to get away with?Quite a bit it would seem."
5,dont care about extras THIS IS FOR THE MOVIE!,"YO THE MOVIE IS VERY GOOD! i enjoyed the performances and action sequences and thought james cameron did a very good job from his 13 year hiatus as a director. the visuals are stunning, this might be why the movie is so great. the story is good and detailed but not as much as terminator and titanic. still this movie does remind you of terminator with all the robots and futuristic air crafts. go get this if you dont really care about extra features most of the time i never watch all the extra stuff just give me the movie so i can watch it and thats it."
3,"visually impressive, great action scenes....","not much can be said about this film that hasn't already been said. It does have an environmental ethic moral and does highlight the dangers and spiritual emptiness of greed.but the main reason to enjoy and appreciate the movie is for the ""eye candy"", the visuals, which are truly state-of-the-art. Kudos to Cameron for delivering another top notch action film."
5,Avatar is still the best!!!!,Avatar was the first 3D movie that we saw in a theater and I think it is the best 3D movie that I've seen in the theater and on 3D Blu-ray. The action is great and the seed (spirit) pods from the tree of life seem like they are falling around you. It is the greatest 3D movie I have seen.
5,Loved,"My oldest granddaughter wanted this movie for a long time I was able to get it for her this last christmas at a very good price here at Amazon compared to other stores. It arrived in perfect conditon and fast service thank you Amazon. I am happy, she was happy and all ends well."
5,Great as it can only be!,"I have seen the Imax/3D version of the movie in the theaters and am still in awe of the spectacular visual effects of the movie. Watching this bluray disc in my Sony Bravia 46"" HDTV did not diminish my being in awe of the movie.A very good buy."
1,A film without any artistic merit and most importantly without any soul,"Here we have James Cameron's new film; chock full of CGI, boring action and....well, that's it, really, nothing else at all.So, a group of human soldiers invade a foreign planet, and the residents are peeved; so, it's Starship Troopers, but without any intelligent satire or....anything really.Don't give me this ""movies are supposed to entertain"" argument either; that's only one part of the role of a film, but Cameron isn't aware of this; from his days under Roger Corman (where he should have stayed) to his newest 11 year old boy's wet dream he's proved this.I end the review with a quote, on Cameron, by a man who understands cinema in its totality:""Cameron isn't evil, he's not an a-hole like Spielberg. He wants to be the new De Mille. Unfortunately, he can't direct his way out of a paper bag."""
5,Wow! This is one of the best movies I have seen.,I was not sure what to expect after all the previews and hype that have been flooding the airwaves for the past few months. Wow! I would recommend if you can go see it in 3D as I did. The mix of animation and real footage is seamless. No spoilers here... The plot for the movie is probably one you are use to seeing. But the fact that they pull it off and you relate to the characters and their plight is rare in some movies. I recommend it as a must-see on the biggest screen you can find.
5,Great Movie!,"I've watched this movie three times already and I just cannot keep my eye's off it! I think its a Wonderful, Great Adventure Movie I've seen in years! When the extended version comes out Buy it, as will have extras and hopefully a digital copy."
3,Space Cats < Thundercats,"If you are a fan of space cats you will love this movie. It's basically Cat people in space. They run around and do stuff on their own planet. There are other monsters and things on the planet too, but the cat people are like humans and totally dominate the planet with their superior intelect. There is a message about saving the environment and causing wars over resources... but tell me somthing I don't know you silly space cats. I'd prefer to see a 3D movie of Thundercats. That show was amazing and would top this one even though James Cameron spent half his adult life making this. I actually think James cameron needed to clone himself a few times over the centuries to finish this project. He's that dedicated to 3D space cats. Lion-o would totally respect that type of dedication. Thundercats have a code of honor like that. Thats why Mumm-ra will never win. In your face Mumm-ra!"
3,"Show is fantastic, but disc not working!","The movie is fantastic, no doubt about it. But the disc one in my set is not functioning probably and it keeps skipping on my players (tested on 2 DVD players, and disc one is still ""unviewable"")..Luckily Amazon allows me to exchange for a new set. Thanks so much!"
5,Great Movie - Bad Quality,"Besides ""Red Cliff International Version - Part I & Part II [Blu-ray]"" this is one of the best movies I have seen lately. Great story line... Beautiful exotic scenery. I watched the 3-D version in theater.As a result, I jumped in and bought the DVD when it first came out in April. To my surprise, the color quality was greatly disappointed. The rich vibrant colors of the forest, of those exotic creatures were replaced with a dull, boring color.If you plan to buy the DVD, maybe you should wait until the next version released in November. I don't know if the blue-ray version is any better.******Updated review...After written the above review, I went searching for a solution for the issue mentioned above. Well, it was not because of the DVD but rather it was the issue with the video cable connecting to the TV. Sorry."
1,"Avatar 3D is a ripoff, Panasonic should be ashamed","Buy this instead: http://www.amazon.com/Avatar-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-Pack/dp/B008XBCJ34/ref=tmm_blu_title_0I bought a $2,500 Panasonic plasma VT50 3DTV in 2012. Being in the panasonic family should get you a path to owning Avatar 3D?Wrong. Panasonic has no rhyme or reason of how to get this movie in 3D. Last month you only need to buy a less than $200 bluray player to get it! I already had the bluray 3D player!A $2,500 PANASONIC TV doesn't qualify though?Panasonic; are actual intellegent people making the decisions on how to get this Blu-Rya in 3D?Very disappointed and thinking of returning the $2,500 TV. Maybe if they suffer enough return on high ticket items, they would screw over high ticket purchasers."
5,Awesome movie at an awesome price!,"This was so cool to watch in 3D, and there were so many extra scenes that weren't shown on the regular dvd. :)"
1,Avatar,"I got this product to run on my VCR but it stoped in the midel of the program and I couldn't get it to restart. I threw it away, ti's junk."
1,Double Dipping is No Good.,"The movie is good, but this Bluray release is not. Fox should have just came out with an edition that comes with the special features, instead of this rush job that only has the film, and nothing more. DO NOT BUY!"
4,Great for the price!!,"It may look like a cheap flimsy player, but I have been enjoying it on my runs. The clamp hold well and I love the rechargable battery which makes it much lighter. I use a different earpiece - a clip-on style stereo headphone since it stays in my ear even after running for an hour. You just can't beat the price of this mp3 player!!!"
5,smart,"Dr. Walford is dying of ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) better known as Lou Gehrig's Disease. ALS is a progressive, fatalneurological disease. The pathogenic mechanism of ALS is UNKNOWN. In about 5 percent of cases, the disease is inherited,but in most cases the cause is still unknownGive the man a break. I have the book and found the accumulated research interesting and compelling. I trust his facts over 99%of other diet book authors. He's got the creds."
1,Just another diet book...,Yeah I keep buying them. One day I will learn. Just another diet book promising something it can not deliver.
2,Warning Vegetarians! Don't buy this book!,"This book contains a sample diet which includes some selection of meat everyday. As the whole premise of the book is to reduce caloric intake while maximizing nutrition, the reader is left to wonder what vegetarian option could be substituted. It's hard to believe that this subject was not even addressed.So if you are a carnivore, I think you will find this book contains tons of helpful information. If you are not, then buy a different book.Look for my copy @ half.com"
1,crap...crap...egg...crap...sausage...crap...,"This book is beyond questioning the worst piece of writing I've ever come across. Its total lack of consistency and focus makes what should have been an educating tour through the concepts of HTML, a confusing bumpcar-ride with Mr. and Mrs. Ray at the wheel. These guys are not only writing about hyper text, they're also writing hyper text themselves!"
1,In This Sign,"One star because this famousboo is not available in aKindle print version. I amdeaf, so the audio book willdo me no good."
1,What Does Al-Qaeda Want?,"The idea of a collection of Al-Qaeda communiques with commentary in the English language is a good one. Unfortunately, this is a botch job. Marlin comes to the subject with no background and edited the communications quite poorly while providing no helpful commentary. He should have left this task to someone even remotely qualified and if his aim was really to make primary sources available to other scholars, then he should have published the messages in their entirety and not edited them. Don't waste your time or money on this volume."
5,Made the best ice cubes ever!,I know that freezing water into ice cubes may be dificult at times but this machine accomplished it with ease!
4,Works great,ice machine works great. Only issue is the steel arm is not long enough to feel the cubes. I bent it so now it works great. For the price this was a good deal
3,Not Easy to Replace,"Replacing my defective ice maker with this one was not quick and easy as I expected. The replacement wire harness connector did not seat completely with the one in the back of the freezer (I had to re-use the old harness). A piece of plastic had to be cut very carefully with a razor knife (the old one had been cut at the factory). Aligning the ice maker with the mounting holes proved to be extremely difficult (its not easy to work with your head in the freezer). Trying to make sure the new ice maker is level was virtually impossible due to the location of the existing mounting holes. If I had to do this over again I would have ordered a replacement motor/timer for the existing ice maker and saved myself a lot of aggravation. Also, this ice maker is not made in the USA, its made in China."
5,cheaper than a new fridge,"I was ready to buy a new refrigerator since my old ice maker was leaking water and making icicles instead of cubes. Looked around at different options and found a great deal on this complete unit. Other places wanted $46 just for the control unit and this complete ice maker cost around $50. It was a good thing because the old unit's coating was peeling so it was completely shot. Easy installation, took about 10 minutes and makes lots of ice now."
5,Easy Replacement,I used this to replace the ice maker in my Kitchen Aid refrigerator and it was an easy replacement. The old one removed simply and this product fit right in place as a perfect replacement. It was simple to do and everything I needed was in the package.
2,Simple Factual Errors,"I haven't read this book, but just looking through the preview, I can see some basic factual errors that make me wonder about how accurate the entire book is. Simple things like the spelling of Sammy's son's name, and the authors claims about the auction of his estate (it wasn't held at his home, as the author claims, it was held at Butterfield & Butterfield. I know this for a fact, because I was there at the auction!), etc.I was going to buy this book, because I adored Sammy Davis Jr, but seems that it was either poorly reported or poorly edited."
5,Love my Kohler medicine cabinet!,"Who knew you could buy such items on Amazon?! I was amazed and so happy when I found.As with most Kohler items, this one doesn't disappoint. It's quality made through and through. The mirrors are clear and every surface is mirrored so you're never looking at dead space.Arrived unharmed with no scratches or broken parts.I didn't install the item myself, so I can't attest to how easy or hard that process might have been, however, my general contractor did not complain, so I'm assuming that's a good thing."
4,Rust free except for hinges,"Overall a very good medicine cabinet. Had no trouble installing it and it looked very nice recessed in the wall. The aluminum body of the cabinet was actually marked Robern, which costs way more than Kohler. The only problem was that after a few years of regular use the hinges started showing rust through the plating. It would be nice if Kohler could address this problem."
5,Good size and weight,We like the solid weight and feel. Will see how the work next spring. Looks well made and should be great..
5,"Daughter used it in public junior high, Loved it!","My daughter used Mavis Beacon version 15 in her junior high tech class, and she asked me to buy it for her little brother, so he could learn to type. I'm buying a copy for my boyfriend, too. He can type, but he wants to type faster -- he's in graduate school. His first language is Spanish, and he has the option of having Mavis speak Spanish.My daughter wants to play the typing games again, just for fun. Doing school work at home? for fun? What better recommendation can I give you?!"
5,Mavis for older op system,"I needed a typing tutor for an older operating system. I use Dragon speech recognition for productivity but still want to improve my typing.There were several apps to choose from, and the service was great. I chose Mavis 15 and it works great. Thanx."
1,Tacky,"This CD is pure tackiness, from the cover pics (jeans and white heels) to the sickeningly mushy lyrics. As for the melodies, they're the same recycled mingle, the same mismatched patchwork of rhythms that seems to typify most Latin pop these days. Thalia mewls like a cat in heat; her crooning, though, is hardly believable.I guess this is the best that can be done with zero talent and great producers. If you're interested in Latin music, please check out other Latin artists; otherwise you might get the wrong impression."
3,D-UNIT!,"this cd is good but has a few flaws,the tempo of the whole album is the same, all the beats sound more or less the same, same pace,no changes, i think the best tracks are ""pass the axe"" (except for shaggs part!!),""consume your soul""(except shaggs part!!) ""my first time"", my first time is good but the chorus is hilarious, its really cheesy,i mean those guys cant sing except for jamie madrox and i still think he aint really good,""black rain"" is cool, um.. ""she was"" is allright except for the chorus,this album is dark, its pretty dark, haunted houses,ghosts,killing,hacking police up with axes what more do you want, if it wasn't for such bad production this cd would be awesome but the production isnt really good, the beats are dull and boring, like i said before same tempo, they dont change, well, i hope this review was helpful, MCL"
4,The truth about Lotus,"Ok, first of all Dark Lotus isn't a battle of who can rap better, it is a group effort of music making. So don't critize Shaggs or anyone else for their lyrics, in whole all the Dark Lotus lyrics are good. The difference between TFTLP and BR is that TFTLP was c.d. out to make a statement. Make people think about the screwed up things that this world offers or just doesn't notice. I personally feel it is the best Psychopathic record ever made, if not the best record ever made, but that's not for me to discuss. BR is more of an entertainment type of album that also let's you know that the Lotus is still strong and about.(the walls is an awesome song though) Maybe they wanted to get one more Lotus album out of the way, cuz we don't know what to expect after the sixth, who knows? The point is you want entertainment then get BR if you want some stuff to think about then get TFTLP they are both incredible albums... hell get both of them.MMCL!!!!!Been down since Ringmaster"
5,Very Pleased Great Value,This item is a beautiful piece. Great value and a true pleasure doing business with the company. I Highly recommend them and will definately do business with them again
5,Great ring!,Excellent ring. It was exactly what I wanted. The bands are a little larger than most rings one encounters of this style...but it makes it more of a statement. The ring feels very good and is true to size. Great quality!
3,Save Your Money,"Let me began by saying I do not like time travel stories and that is what this story ends up being. I like the work of the writing team L.A. Graf and this is the start of a solid story. First the only lower decks characters really developed were the ones introduced by the authors and not the ones we have seen in the TV series like D'Amato,Tomlinson,Martine,Palamas,and others. Why was this allowed? I did like seeing Uhura, Chekov and Sulu. This book sets up the remainder of the story so stick with it as it gets better as it goes along"
2,A whimper maybe but certainly not a bang,"Proberbly rates a 3 star on the basis of a good read (assuming that you had read the two pervious books). The ideas were interesting but somewhat convoluted (perhaps a requirement for the story to hang together). The demise of the the major antagonist, Sappho, was a bit tepid. It seemed as though Hinz in attempting to pull all the strands together to end the trilogy did just that - but didn't in my opinion quite succeed. Is this a prelude to another book where Gillian returns ?"
4,Robben's methods are inspiring,"This is a worthwhile approach to some excellent blues. However, I thought I was purchasing a DVD instead of just a CD. My fault. Since I owned a video copy and no longer have VHS player I wanted to replace the tape with a DVD and did not look at it close enough."
1,Very unhappy,"I have long considered ""Chimes..."" to be one of the greatest films ever. I bought two copies of the Bongo pressing, one for myself, one for my son. Neither will play on DVD players. AMZ should be ashamed at this kind of misrepresentation."
3,Disappointed in the format.,Could not play this dvd on my dvd player (TV). It plays in my computer but difficult to see in small screen. Too bad because it is a great movie and deserves a better medium.
1,"OUCH ! One of the WORST books I've ever NOT finished,","Turgid prose, simplistic plot, hackneyed characterizations. I, who read cereal boxes in their entirety, couldn't get past the first third of this affront to writing.I read and enjoy (and recognize as NOT great literature) most of the political thrillers. This doesn't make the cut.Had Dan not been VP, this never would have been printed."
4,"The Book is Great, but ""Ouch!"", my leg!","I remember dearly when Timmy won the gold for our great country. And his book on achievement delivers more of that olympic gold straight to you! Boy did I learn to achieve. However, what is not clear in the book (and I only learned when my lawsuit was dismissed), is that you can achieve in more than just gymnastics! I really messed up my leg something bad. They need to come out with a second edition that explains the message better, like in the front cover or something. Then, this book will be a ""perfect 10""."
2,Does not seems to be what I've expected!!!,"Nice looking, its heavy, but at a glance coatings look like not well distributed on lens surface. Images of venus and saturn very blur and hazy.I tried this eyepiece in a well collimated reflector telescope (orion spaceprobe 130) in which other eyepieces work very well.Not Good."
3,Gold is not sufficient,"I was impressed with this watch, and when it arrived, I was disappointed. It should come in platinum mined on Pluto for the price."
5,Klipsch Groove HG,"The Klipsch IGroove arrived within 2 days. Setup very easy, worked great. Very satisfied. It has my recommendation."
5,The End?,"I admit it, I'm buying into the hype. But whether or not the Beanie Babies will be around in Y2K or not, who could resist this face? My kids have dozens of Beanie Babies...and through chewing, rain storms, art projects and more, they seem to last and last."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I know this is cheap and all I wanted it for was to move some hanging close from one apartment to another on the same floor. On the third trip down the hall, the top hinge snapped and the clothes hit the floor. It was only 20 bucks so I wasn't expecting much and I only wanted it to make this one move, but it really wasn't even worth twenty bucks. I also did not load it down with 40 pounds of clothes either.If you decide to buy it, re-enforce all of the joints with duck tape before using. That should make it hold up a bit longer."
2,Crappy as Crappy Can Be,"I bought this rack, assembled it, placed clothes on it, and promptly returned it when the cheap plastic attachment broke. I guess it might not be THE worst thing there, but it lists no weight requirements. Obviously, there are some.If you're looking for a very cheap product that doesn't hold many clothes on a regular basis this might be fine. Otherwise, go for a commercial grade one."
1,pretty disappointed...,"i recently ordered a garment rack from them... heard nothing for a few days and then heard, from amazon, that the order was canceled because the product was out of stock. i'm pretty disappointed that stacks and stacks listed the item as available when it wasn't and that they did not contact me themselves. needless to say... i will go somewhere else with my business..."
5,sturdy lcd wall mount,I just installed this item the other week and am very happy with it. It seems pretty sturdy and offers the flexibility of viewing your TV from different angles. The installation can be done by one person(I did this myself). You just need a stud finder and a phillips screw driver. You don't have to worry about installing this semi-crooked because you can rotate the tv to compenstate for any misalignments you do on the install.
4,works on some types of spots?,"I have had a lot of sun damage on my face over the years (I'm very fair and do the burn-tan thing). At 41 I really started noticing that my skin tone is really uneven and every blemish scars. After reading about the ingredients of skin bleaches I decided to try Derma-e. I've been pretty happy so far. The sun spots are fading well and my skin tone is overall improved. The large light brown spots (hormones?) on the other side seems a little more stubborn but I'm not even a quarter of the way through the jar so there's still plenty of opportunity. As for the smell, it's not strong and doesn't linger - to me it smells sort of like a coffee latte. I put this on after washing my face at light and before makeup (mineral powder) in the morning and it all blends together nicely."
5,Great for the Az. trail riders!,This is a great way to discover and ride new trails. The author has complete maps and levels of difficulty for all the rides. It's a good book to stick in your saddle bag and carry with you. We have ridden many of the trails and find the discriptions in the book to be accurate.
3,It's Just Not RAMA,"This work is loosely based upon the RAMA series of novels Gentry Lee co-authored with Arthur C. Clarke. Lee has boldly attempted to achieve something new within the RAMA universe, but the reader familiar with the earlier books will not forgive. The time of the Great Chaos is a superb backdrop but it is not enough of a parellel for the books to be considered part of the RAMA Universe. We never see RAMA or any of its inhabitants, just something similar. There is, however, an extraordinary scene aboard the spacecraft where the main characters are forced to endure a simulation of the Hiroshima bomb blast. Yes, it is a wonderful book with some wonderful elements, but in the end it is simply a poor attempt to copy the breathtaking feel of the original RAMA story."
2,First half Excellent - Second half Sucks.,"I loved the first half of the book, the characters are interesting and you want to care about them. The adventures on Mars or should I say the short term adventures on Mars, was along the lines of RAMA. Then sadly to say, as the story progress it falls apart. I had the feeling I was reading the bible in a sci-fi content. Lee puts too much of his religious beliefs in the characters, thus destroying any connection you had with them. Lets hope book two is more adventure and less religion"
1,"OK, but only half of a book","What did I think of the book??? I say WHY BOTHER?!?! Like many others who have commented here over the last 18 months, I feel I was ""hoodwinked"" by Mr. Lee. It appears he wrote half of a book and managed to peddle it to the unsuspecting public. I've learned to never buy one of Lee's books without checking the last page to see whether or not it is ""to be continued"". In this case Mr. Lee is already 2 years late on his promise. Yawn...I'm tired of waiting."
4,"ok, so it ain't as good as rama, it is still worth reading.","ok, rama was a damn good book set, I have read it so many times the books fell apart (don't ask.) I think Gentry Lee could have got some other directions but hey I am no write (no yet anyway.) But I ask you start with earth and end with a raped and beeten death? beatris is a good charactor on the level of St. Micheal or even falstaff or puck from rama, but come on. what would nicole have done if richard and micheal where killed? she would have had some proplems wouldn't she? And what ever happened to max pucket? or simon? if you read this gentry lee please I beg of you drop me an e-mail, I am not mad as I have not let read any but this one (and the ramas) of your books."
3,Maybe I'm too new to appreciate it.,"I found this book to be somewhat a waste of my money for now. The book does the usual overview or Tai Chi origins and ""benefits of"", but the pictures and desriptions are lacking for a beginner. There are two nice aspects of this book, though. One is the Q and A section at the end, which really has some good info. Second is the pictures at the begining of poor posture/form and good posture/form. The good/bad section doesn;t offer much explaination, so some of the pictures are still cryptic. Well organized and compact, but I think I need something a little more basic."
5,Loved this!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. There were many ""old wives tales"" in it I had heard growing up from the older people in my family. It was nice to know my relatives aren't the only ones who tell these tales. There were even more goodies I had never heard before - some of them are hilarious! I am so grateful Mr. Randolph wrote this down before this folklore was lost. If you have an interest in the old ways... this book is for you."
1,It looks great but the size and quality isn't there.,"I thought i can store alot of toys , but actually it's smaller than I expected. It would of been nice if it was bigger with some more quality into the bins."
5,"Touching, uplifting and incredibly human","In Midwives, Chris Bohjalian does something incredibly rare by capturing both person and place in this story of loss and redemption in a small Vermont town. The plot centers around a woman looking back at her fourteenth year when her mother, a midwife, was put on trial for causing the death of one of her patients. While the story is creative and well-told, it is the relationships between the characters which truly drive the book.I often judge a book by how connected I feel to the characters, if they are people like those I know; if they are fully-developed and human. Midwives is filled with characters who resonate with the reader and with issues that get to the heart of the ambiguities and complications that life can be filled with. There are no easy answers in Midwives, nor in life, which is probably why I enjoyed the book so much. For those who enjoyed A Map of the World and One True Thing, this is a perfect addition to your library."
2,Interesting topic but slow,"The biggest issue that I had with this book was that I never really cared about any of the characters. There was no emotional attachment that had me sad for them or pulling for them - on either side. I stopped caring about how the trial ended up. The story had a good start, but it began meandering and never recovered . It wasn't awful, but it was slow and quite a chore to get through."
5,"Stunning, intriguing, and gripping....","From the drama of the courtroom to the mediocrity of family life, Bohjalian captures it all. This book was touching - and haunting - and left unanswered (in a good way) the question ""When is wrong not really wrong?"""
2,"Good premise, but left me flat","I was disappointed with this book. The first hundred pages, which covered the tragedy of Charlotte Bedford, WERE gripping. But the tension and drama ended there, and it seemed there was nothing to look forward to except finishing the book so I could start another! I agree with some of the other reviewers who said that the characters were under-developed - I didn't get a sense of who any of them really were. And Tom (the boyfriend) was indeed unrealistic. In the beginning he was portrayed as somewhat of a ""tough"", then inexplicably he displays a sensitivity that few boys his age possess! I didn't buy his character, and I didn't care about the other ones. The end was a bit of a surprise, but by then it had lost it's impact...All in all a disappointment."
2,Not great,"Interesting subject matter, but the writing was uninspired, the pace seemed too slow, and the characters were flat. Did not finish."
4,An interesting read,"Connie, the main character is intelligent, sensible and compelling. She tells the story of her mothers account as a midwife during an ice storm in Vermont when the birth of a child goes terribly wrong. As the reader you were easily wrapped up in the love of the family and the love between the child and mother. This is not a story for a weak stomach as some of the details are very graphic. It's an easy read and moves quickly. There aren't too many slow spots. It makes you wanting to keep turning the pages. The end of the book ends differently tha one might think."
4,"Difficult to put down, great Northeast Kingdom background.","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Having had two high-risk pregnancies, home birth could not have been for me, but I found it fascinating. I think Sibyl had no choice but to try to save the baby as she did. As a legal secretary, I always enjoy courtroom drama. My favorite thing, though, is the background. My husband is from St. Johnsbury, Vermont -- the Northeast Kingdom. I've been to many of the places mentioned and felt like I was right there. Home from work and watching the Opray Winfrey book review made me wish I had read it before it was on and then went up there to review it."
2,Boring,"I thought this book was boring. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. I bought it because I liked other books from Oprah's book club, but not this one."
5,Midwives is one of those books that you're sorry to see end.,I loved this book!! Midwives continues to surprise the reader until the very end. A real page turner!!!
3,Cane River,Cane River was very informative and should be required reading for highschool age children. The reason for this it opens your eyes to racism issue between white and blacks. Also class and racism against blacks. Cane River was very easy to read and yoou felt as if you were apart of the family and could feel there pain. That people in love couldnt be together due to soictey not being accepting of race crossing. Which in the end hurt a lot of people
1,"See Chris Write. Write, Chris, Write!","I had never ventured into the realm of Oprah's Book Club, but found this well-worn volume on the public library shelves. The topic intrigued me, so I opened the pages. Alas, this book is written at maybe a 4th grade level -- it grieves me to think of the women who found this to be a powerful read, or a worthy literary effort. I would suggest that these readers begin with Hooked on Phonics. Or Dick and Jane."
2,saddening,"Not what I expected. Dark, graphic, depressing, drawn out. But there is something that remains with you---I definitely did not leave with a good feeling about midwifery. Deaths, breakdowns, cancer. This is not the book to raise your spirits. I think that most of Oprah's books are pretty dark. What's wrong with some sunshine?"
4,"Found this book to be an eye-opener, of what could go wrong","This has been one of the best ""real"" books I've read, it becomes an eye-opener to those of us caring for women. It should be required reading in all midwifery programs, open for discussion and how the situation was handled. A great book"
4,Likes to read,"This book was written so well, that I actually thought Chris, the author, was the woman narrating the book. It wasn't until I looked at the author bio that I realized Chris was a father and husband, not a woman telling what happened when she was a young girl. Well done. I also loved ""Where the Heart Is"" by Billie Letts."
2,"To be discouraged from getting pregnant, read this...","The novel Midwives, written by Chris Bohjalian, seems at certain points to be the diary of the teenage daughter of the Vermont midwife on trial for involuntary manslaughter and illegally practicing medicine. Although it is in fact a work of fiction, the entire book is written from the point of view of the daughter, who is like a wallflower in various situations. She overhears important conversations between her mother and their lawyer, for example, which are key when it comes to fully understanding the plot and storyline of the novel. Although I enjoyed this book only minimally, I will say that the numerous details of the seasonal Vermont landscapes, THE SOMETIMES PAINFUL AND DANGEROUS PROCESS OF CHILDBIRTH, and the complicated emotions that accompany death made me appreciate the tireless efforts of the author. Mr. Bohjalian did an excellent job describing every moment in its entirety and enabling the reader to visualize each schene."
1,Predictable at best!,"Save your $$! Read the back cover and you'll know exactly what happens. I assume there was some sort of political message in this book, but I'm not sure--I don't think the author knows either. Flat writing and forgettable characters. A real yawn!"
3,Good book; not too compelling,"I really enjoyed this book but I can't believe how long it took me to get through it. I have lately been whipping through books but this one I realized took me a long time. Not because it was boring but because it didn't grab me...therefore I found myself not devoting a lot of time to reading it. It was a great story line and I did bring it up in conversations with friends so I must have liked it, but just wasn't too compelling.There is better, there is worse."
4,gripping,"Once you get past the first 65 pages with i found boring as hell, too descriptive, and seems to get of track by describing every miniscule thing, i didnt know if i could go on any longer, but at page 66 it all changes and gets good from then on i couldnt put it down."
1,Manipulative in the extreme,"I wonder what motivated the author to choose his subject? I think he sensationalized a highly unlikey scenario in order to make a buck and in the process slandered the midwifery profession. As a former client of a home-birth midwife, I knew better than to read this book during my pregnancies. Whew! Am I glad I waited! The author did not give a fair shake to the realities of miwifery practice - that their ""outcomes"" consistently are superior to those of doctor supervised hospital based births. Yes, patient selection has a great deal to do with this - however, the care and attention midwives give their clients are also responsible. This book simply offended me."
3,"A pretty good book, easy to read and a fun page turner.","I really enjoyed reading this novel. It had my attention from the very beginning and was a real page turner. I found myself easily identifying with the characters. I am a strong supporter of homebirth and found the description of midwives and homebirth realistic. I do however feel the circumstances of the women's death were highly unlikely. But, this is just a fictional book and taken as such is a fun one at that. I reccommend this book, buy it, open it and enjoy!"
4,Pretty Kitty,"I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She refused to wear anything but yellow gold until this was in her hand. A very nice design that catches the eye without being gaudy. Good quality for the money, but the diamonds are not the highest clarity, of course. They add a bit of bling to the piece, but don't expect them to sparkle like a larger more expensive diamond would."
3,Nice but not rose-gold hue as expected,"As everyone said, the pendant is nice, and cute. Was a great hit with the wife but the chain (even with all the comments) was even thinner than expected. I kept looking at the hue of the rose gold and don't think it has the right ""rose gold"" hue. Looked more like normal gold not as yellow but still just gold and not as rosy as the picture. That is why I took out 1 star for the chain and the second star for the color. But it is a nice piece. It is buyers be wary as opposed to beware."
1,I have had two products fried during power surges with this,"I purchased this product (maybe a slightly older model) a number of years ago for my computer. During a lightning storm my computer stopped working and when I opened it up the power supply cable had been burned and was melted to the motherboard. Since the surge protector was insured I submitted my claim with pictures and waited, Newpoint sent me back a letter saying they tested my surge protector and it passed their tests, thus they believed it was a prolonged overvoltage that caused my issue. Despite that they were sending me a new surge protector. Fast forward 5 years, the replacement surge protector is now being used on an older TV in my bedroom and during another lightning hits (different home, different state) and pop, the TV plugged into the Newpoint is dead. Things plugged into $2 surge protectors did just fine, but once again the Newpoint ""protected"" stuff is dead. I will never buy another Newpoint product again."
4,Pleasant surprise.,"Read the reviews still wasn't expecting much. Purchased for my 2012 Xterra to give it more truck like feel and I couldn't be happier. The pads really do make my driving experience more enjoyable. Installs easily, appears to be of good quality. Go ahead and pick one up."
4,Makes the steering wheel more conformable to grip.,"This steering wheel cover is very comfortable to grip (it has ""bumps"" on the sides where you put your hands). Before I installed the cover, I heated it up with a hair dryer for about 5 minutes to make the material more flexible. My only disappointment with it, after installation, is that I've had the ""bumps"" slide out of alignment (the ""10"" and ""2"" positions on the steering wheel) twice so far."
1,disappointment,"had bought cd for daughter with the hope it would have titles that were in movie, but that's not the case. sounds just like a typical walt disney teenie mix..."
1,Are we eating the same thing?,"I got a box of these at my local Wegmans store and to be honest, the initial taste is the same as the smell of fresh woodchips that you would use to line a hamsters cage. The aftertaste is like burnt popcorn. I'm sure they're healthy for you but blech, they are hard to get down. I'll definitely be looking for a different granola bar next time I go to the store."
4,Yummy bars,These granola bars are good. A quick source for some fiber and protein in a yummy package. But always check the nutritional facts for yourself.
4,For writing to my children,"I was looking for journals that I could use to write to and about each of my children. I specifically wanted one with a ""window"" in the cover, that I could insert a photo into. The message in the beginning is very fitting for my intent - sharing my thoughts of love and inspiration with my children. All in all, this is a great journal, nice design (spiral-bound for easy access to front and back of each page), and sturdy cover. The commercial aspect is a little heavy, with the words to the song and intermittent printed messages throughout. If you are looking for a blank, generic journal, this is probably not the one for you, but it was nearly perfect for my intended use."
5,The perfect cheesy accesorie,"When i told the groom those where going to be our wedding bubbles, he turned red, and he said that they were to cheesy, but when they arrived we were so happy, the weddig cake shape is so beautiful and they make huge bubbles.It's the perfect accesorie for the ceremonie."
2,Cute looking but the bubbles don't live up to the standard of what bubbles should be,"I purchased these bubbles for my Wedding, and though they are really cute (the package arrived today), upon opening the box and trying to blow the bubbles: First try I blew a bubble --- then it popped --- as it was still attached to the wand. Second try yielded only one bubble. I am a Master bubble blower so I know it's definitely *not* the user - but rather the product that is deficient. Because the product is so cute, what I have decided to do is empty out all of the *bad* bubbles and replace them with Gymboree bubbles! Brilliant! Thankfully I will be having a small Wedding so I am able to do this in my spare time. Further, this way I know that my guests will have a pleasant and I would bet rather fun experience with the bubbles.Problem solved."
4,good value but flimsy elastic,"These sheets are a good price. As another reviewer noted, they did have a ""funny smell"" when the package was first opened. A quick wash and it was resolved. They also softened up very nicely with the wash. My only complaint is that the elastic is rather flimsy, and doesn't have great staying power. I do have a thick mattress, with a pillow top also, so, if you have a regular size (thickness) mattress it might not be an issue. Overall a good deal for the money."
4,Pretty nice fabric at a great price,"I think these sheets are a great deal. If your not picky about the manufacturer using non-matching thread with some not so straight stitching, as shown in pics I'm about to upload, these will be fine for you. How often do you look closely at the inside/very edges of your sheets? No issues with bleeding or softness."
5,A Must-Have for Jazz Fans,"I bought this book on a friend's recommendation. It's pages are filled with great album art that spans the range of great Latin Jazz and Rock, from Desi Arnaz and Mongo Santamaria to Carlos Santana and Los Lobos. It is like a pictoral history of great Latin music in America, including a section on Brasilian music. Tito Puente, Poncho Sanchez....even Dizzy Gillespie (who helped introduce Latin Rhythms to America) is represented....all in glorious vintage styles that you forgot you loved!So if you love Jazz, buy this one.Now I need to add these albums to my record collection."
1,Doesn't fit 2011 Jetta,"This wiper does not fit the 2011 Jetta even though amazon says it does!!!!! So, don't buy it if you have a 2011 Jetta and don't trust amazon if you want to make sure a part fits!!"
5,Great wiper,"Quiet and streak free, not sure what else you can ask for. This is my second set for my 2008 BMW and the first set lasted me a year. No complaints here."
3,"Very interesting and useful training tool, but...",This is a great idea - you can immediately understand the concept and what this club is trying to do on the very first swing. I've been swinging it for 10-15 minutes every few days in the back yard. Do I think this will make a large impact on my game? Hard to say. Two thing hamper this from being a superb training tool.1. It's EXTREMELY heavy. It is not like swining a real club at all. Might be equivalent in weight to 3 clubs in your hands at once.2. It's very short! As a 7 iron this is noticeably shorter than a standard. You really have to dig do to make contact with a ball (if you want to actually hit with it).Overall I give it a 3/5
5,Easy!,"The instructions were very easy to follow. Plug and play device. Started working within a couple hours, although I did have to decrease my freezer temperature. Would definitely recommend!"
4,Ice maker,Great product. Cheap and easy to put in and works like a charm. Do not get excited if it waits a while before making ice. (just warming up)
1,Inaccurate Product Description,Product doesn't fit my model of Maytag. The wiring is too short to reach the plug in the back. The suggestion that this is a replacement for a Maytag D7824706Q is completely wrong. I wasted $50. Should have purchased directly from Maytag. What a waste.
1,This is a REPLACEMENT ice maker is not what what is shown,Whay you get is not the maytag part in the photo. I had my installer come back. He had charged me $150 for his real Maytag part (I thought that was high and found this one here). He can back to switch them and we discovered the truth -- he had to use the old wiring as the wiring provided didn't fit the jennaire freezer. Just put it in so I'm not sure if it works -- reviews here seem generally positive so we'll see. This UNIVERSAL REPLACEMENT PART is all plastic and isn't metal like the original. I did find a Maytag part on line for $75. Amazon should make it clear that this is not a maytag item but a UNIVERSAL REPLACEMENT PART.
3,ice maker part,I think this was advertised as a maytag part but I'm pretty sure it wasn't. With slight modification it works fine.& was priced fairly.
1,Choose another brand,"The dishwasher is not the easiest to install. The electrical and the water supply has to placed in the special tracks. You will more than likely have to cut the back bottom shelf and the side back of your cabinet under the sink to get the return hose in the recommended location.If you rinse and scrape your dishes clean before you load them, this dish washer is good for you. If you don't, choose another brand like Maytag.The dishes dry after the 2 hr cycle is done. However, all the walls inside the washer are all wet. So you have to leave the door open with the lights on to dry the interior.Oh yeah, if you don't do your dishes daily, you will get a nice stench due to the collection of water and debri from the dishes at the bottom."
2,Misrepresentation,Not quite what I expected. I ordered the actual The Payroll Source hardcover text book and received the Answer key soft cover book. Provides prompt delivery.
5,Great book,"This book provides unique insight into a mindset few can ever know.The reader is treated to a visual chronology of intifada graffiti thatuntil now has remained an undocumented form of communication. Thestory of seemingly ""random"" markings on walls evolved into the uneditedstory of the intifada, beyond any censorship. The book also shows howreligious zeal and political activism eventually became so interwoventhat they produced a culture in which one's value is directlyproportioned to the death and destruction one facilitates. The priceof martyrdom is not only one's death, but also the maximizing of thebody count. This book is a must-read for anyone with an interest inthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
2,I guess everyone's entitled...,"... to not bring his/her ""A game"" all the time. As a regular reader of Lisa Scottoline's books, this was the weakest I've seen. The lead character was way too unreal, even for fiction. At least a few times I found myself saying, ""Oh, come on..."" But, I've tried writing. It's tougher than I thought, and Scottoline's usually a winner. So, a fast read, and I'll look forward to the next one."
5,Scottoline's in top form,"I've read all of Lisa's (easier to type than ""Scottoline's"") novels; as a matter of fact, I have them all in First Editions. She never disappoints. In Vicki Allegretti, Lisa's added a new character to her pantheon, one with great promise, and who opens the door for Lisa to explore even more dramatic directions as Allegretti's a prosecutor (Lisa's other continuing protagonists are defense attorneys).This book zings along. Her characters are interesting, engaging and witty (Lisa's use of humor is very deft, and you get to laugh in all the right places at just the right time. She's got great comedic timing). The plot is tight and believable (I won't rehash it, as it's in so many other reviews). The conclusion resolves the story very satisfactorily (a trait some authors seem to lack). I strongly recommend this book, as well as her previous work.On another note, also consider visiting Lisa's web site. She's a very gracious person, and there's a lot on her site you might enjoy."
5,"""FOR TODAY, REMEMBER THE ALAMO!""","Carter Burwell's score for the epic Disney film ""The Alamo"" is a true example of great film music. It features a very interesting Mexican-Celtic blend of music, encompassing all the characters in the film (From the Mexican soldados to the Celtic-descendant Texans). Never is this mix more evident than in the track ""Deguello de Crockett,"" where the Mexican brass music and David Crockett's soulful fiddle playing blend to make what can only be described as a ""Mexican lamentation"" that is part of what truly is the best scene in the movie. The rest of the score is solid, and belongs in the soundtrack collections of history and film buffs alike, and is the perfect background music to a superb historical epic! Grade: A"
5,No more gag breath,"I just purchased my second bottle of PetzLife Oral Spray. The first bottle lasted about 5 months because I rarely could remember to use it more than 1-2 a week. The effect on doggy breath is instant, and I've noticed about a 10% reduction in my dog's tarter buildup. I'm sure it would work much better if I used it as directed."
1,PetzLife oral care spray,"We have been using the product regularly now for a few weeks. To date, when we spray their teeth they make a strange face and lick their lips. Beyond that, no change. Granted the product doesn't say how long it will take to work, nor the degree of improvement to expect. So far, it hasn't done any harm."
5,definite improvement,"I have a 5 year old greyhound with REALLY BAD teeth. His breath is atrocious.I'm sure I used a few more sprays than the bottle recommended, but it didn't hurt the dog. I saw definite improvement in his teeth after a few weeks. His teeth became whiter and his breath probably because a smidge less stinky.Because he wasn't a fan of the spray bottle, I bought gel as the replacement."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE NOR USE THIS PRODUCT !!!!,"Petzlife contains ingredients of questionable benefit to a pet. Particularly to a cat. Yes, Petzlife may well clean your cat's teeth. HOWEVER, many of its ingredients are not suitable for the kitty's overall health. Continuous ingestion of essential oils can cause irreversible damage to the liver. Sometimes leading to death. Chances are that the cat will not take too kindly to having this snake oil sprayed in his mouth anyway.Should any pet owner suspect that this product has caused adverse reactions (vomiting, lethargy), get bloodwork done. High liver enyzmes is a red flag. Bear in mind the sometimes insidious nature of slow poisoning."
2,Thought I found the answer to my dog's plaque build up,"I bought this after my vet told me that my dog, Max, had to get another cleaning. We had him under anesthesia for the cleaning. It was about $300 and it made my Max act unusual for days after the procedure. So I did some research to see if there was a way to prevent another cleaning. So I bought this spray.Pros:- Relieves bad breath on contact- Easy to use (spray)- Smells good and all natural ingrediantsCons:- Does not prevent or get rid of plaque (at least for my dog)- Questionable taste (Max literally eats everything, I can give my prescription pills out of my hand and he hates this stuff)This may work for your pet but it does not work for mine. I find that good ol' brushing does the trick. I use this spray on top of the brushing so it gets rid of his bad breath instantly."
3,Causes Bed dives,"I can't really rate this product because whenever I used it with my 4 year old cock-a-poo she would run and dive under the bed immediately afterward. It got so that if she even saw me reach for the bottle she would bed dive. Obviously she doesn't like it, and doesn't want me to use it, so I haven't."
2,didn't work for my dog,Don't waste your money! It didn't work for my sheltie. I used it according to the instructions on the bottle.
2,damaged,"I like the songs, but the last song does not play properly (plays for a couple seconds and stops and again again). I think the CD is damaged, but did not bother to return for one song."
3,Annoying!,"The music and singing on this CD are incredibly annoying! One song in particular just repeats the same phrase a ridiculous number of times. The only good thing about this CD is that some of the songs are familiar English songs sung in Spanish.I got this CD as a non-Spanish speaking mom to help expose my daughter to Spanish as much as possible. I feel the music is a bit fast for non-Spanish speakers and not spoken as clearly as needed to really use it as a learning tool. It will be more background noise than anything until we both know more Spanish.Of the 5 Spanish CDs we have to learn from, I would rate this one the least effective for learning from."
4,Focus on the Positive!,"As a recent graduate, I found Donna's book to be an excellent resource before starting my new career as a nurse. The main theme that stood out to me, is to focus on the positive things that happen each day at work. As a new nurse, if you get hung up on the negatives, you will give up too quickly. This book helps me to remind myself of that every day. The checklists of things to do as you get started are extremely helpful with all you have to remember. And last but absolutely not least, the many quotes from other new grads are inspiring! Definitely worth the time to read!!"
3,Okay if you are looking for generic career advice,"I expected this book to be more tailored to the experiences of a first-year nurse. Instead it seems like a book of Career Advice 101 slightly skewed to the nursing profession. Gems like: don't show up late, find a mentor, don't wear dirty clothes, and be nice to your coworkers are common sense and old news if you're constantly reading up on career strategy like me. If you have sought out career advice before then you are probably too advanced for this book."
5,Inspiring and Much Needed in the Jewish community!,"This book was wonderful, full of tales and folklore about powerful and holy Jewish women who often did not have the chance to tell their own stories. The author, Yitzhak Buxbaum, has a great respect for holy women and this becomes evident in his interpretations and comments about each tale. The stories are inspiring and fascinating - what makes a Jewish woman a holy person or ""tzaddika"" is not always what modern society thinks of when they describe powerful women, but these women are strong and courageous in their own right and deserve to be recognized. A book such as this one is long overdue. Recommended to anyone needing some added inspiration and heart warming stories added to their lives."
3,good but...,"lots of it is common sense. questions i have is why doesnt he name the millionaire who taught him these lessons, and why the websites he listed in the book isn't even up yet."
3,simple read,its easy to read and understand but doesnt tell you anything new but is a good book for teens to learn about how to build wealth
1,not worth the money,There was nothing in this book that was worth spending money for. Save the purchase price and put it towards your own million.
3,The Five Lessons a Millionaire Taught Me About Life and Wealth,I bought this as a gift for my husband. I have not been able to read it myself yet. The Five Lessons a Millionaire Taught Me About Life and Wealth by Richard Paul Evans. I have enjoyed all of his other books.
4,Dimension of fractal objects,A suitable book to remove any doubt about calculation of dimension of fractal objects. I enjoyed the chapter about ergodic theorem.
3,It's ok but kind of cheesy,The kids do like it but it's kind of flimsy we have to glue the legs on because they wouldn't stay into position.
5,patches fan,"Such a cute book. Any Patches fan will love it. It brought back some old, warm and fuzzy memories. It was also a great gift for other Patches Pals I know."
1,Vacuous story telling,This was a terribly disappointing book because the subject was so well chosen. But Boot's narrative is mostly story telling drawn from contemporary accounts with a much too credulous approach taken to the swashbuckling tales of derring-do that nineteenth century historians were given to. It's pretty much free of any analysis - were America's small wars well chosen? Did the U.S. benefit or bring benefits to the other countries affected? What about the conflicts that America chose to sit out? One learns nothing about any of these questions. Neither is there any non-US viewpoint (it would have been helpful to hear at least a fragment of the Nicaraguan / Haitian / Filipino / Chinese perspectives).
1,The savage wars of peace. by max boot,this bookstore should be receiving 5 stars. I received this book in time in the shape it was promised at a great price. I am surprised original review was for a different book I ordered around 6 months or longer ago.************ 5 STARS ********************************Dennis W.
3,Decent wire,"For the price this is a great speaker wire and had absolutely no problems with sound or rolling it onto the walls. The problem arose after the speaker wire was up, however. To say that the product's stickiness is limited would be an understatement. I have had to put this product back up on more than one occasion and one instance found the wire tangled in my roomba when I was away from work. But when all is said and done. It does hide relatively easy and it has fantastic sound. If the tape side worked as well as the rest of the product this would definently be a five star product."
3,"does its job, a little hard to install","good quality speaker wire. super thin. There are a couple of design flaws though. one is the way the terminating blocks are designed. Instead of having flat inserts on one side, its a chore to get the solid copper wire, let alone tighten it down. also the block could have been smaller and less of an eyesore. of course and handy person could just solder it. also peeling back the layers to get to the copper wire is a chore as well. I ran this under my carpet and its fantastic for that. i did not run it along the wall or paint it so i cant comment on that. i got it for $13 at 30ft. Would not pay much more for it though."
3,"Not, by any means, Rucker's best.","Rucker rarely breaks out of the adolescent mode in this average collection of short stories - where he does, however, the results are intriguing though still fairly derivative.If, as I did, you first encountered him through the excellent - and truly innovative - 'White Light', you'll be disappointed by this collection. What is good here? I enjoyed 'The Fifty-Seventh Franz Kafka' and 'Bringing in the Sheaves' - stories where the Scientific American physics are turned down and Rucker dabbles with the grotesque...This collection will stay on my shelf - but I'll be back to my Virgin Paperback copy of White Light and seeking readmission to the Library of Forms!"
4,Clean and stylish,"I just got the Fossil smart watch and I like it a great deal.I got mine from the shop@homenetwork and it was $59.00, it's the cheapest place I could it and they were in stock as of 12/10/05.I love having the internet on my wrist and the time displayed in such fun ways,even when your at work and the time seems to drag so slow,it's nice to kill a few minutes playing with your watch and reading the latest headlines and stock quotes."
5,Wonderful for Toddlers,"I found this book because we love the illustrator, but the best part of the book is a design feature. The Table of Contents has a picture next to each story title, so my toddler can choose the story he wants based on the picture. Ingenious! Sure to be a bestseller if reprinted. (On a side note, the illustrations were a disappointment for Mr. Rojankovsky but the book is still a winner.)"
1,Street Gangs of Hong Kong,When I went online to purchase this movie. The title was right as well the description and who was starring in this movie. But when I received the martial art movie it had the right title but the wrong actors.
1,Retro Kung Fu Fans listen up!,"I purchased this dvd only to be disappointed to find outthat it is not the original Street Gangs of Hong Kong movie.What is inside is a movie called, ""Street Gangs of Hong Kong: The Delinquent.Some of the original cast members are in it, but it is not the moviethat you want to see. Although the movie poster is authentic, you will bedisappointed."
2,Problems,"I had bought the Eileen 8-cup press in January, it was shipped in February to delivery address. When I opened it (the address is a vacation home in the US, since I live overseas), the pyrex glass was cracked. Amazon was kind enough to replace it, although it out of the 30-day warranty return policy. We received the new one in two days, but it was also cracked when I checked it, without use. We were not able to return it because we had to leave that afternoon. We will only be back on June 15.It looks nice, in fact beautiful, but it or the packaging does not resist delivery handling procedures.I wonder if we can get a replacement.A. Wong"
2,Teapot leaks when pouring,"I found that this teapot leaks down the side of the spout when pouring tea. It seems impossible to avoid as I've tried pouring several different ways (fast, slow, with infuser, without infuser, etc). I believe that the curvature of the spout is the Achilles heel of this teapot. A good portion of your tea will wind up in a puddle on the table when you use this product."
5,Great product,"I had this item before. Lost it in a move, but glad to have it back. Steeps multiple cups (which I love). Easy, convenient, great look."
4,"Not bad, does the job","Pretty Decent Tea maker.The size is a bit big if you're just one person drinking tea, but would be idea for 2-3 people. Love the feature where you can seal in the leaves from over brewing of the tea leaves. The only gripe I have is that the cool down factor is pretty quick being that it is glass."
2,Holes too big in press,"I was looking to get away from teabags when I looked at this product. Since this is advertised as a tea press and because the photos don't give you a good shot of the infuser, I choose this model. In addition to traditional teas, I blend my own chai and hibiscus teas. I call BS on any of these reviews that say it works for regular teas because it doesn't. Unless you make traditional tea and you make sure to remove any small pieces of tea, you will find small pieces floating in your tea after you have brewed it. You should buy this only if you don't mind the tea being loose in your cup, you aren't making teas blended with spices, you are using teabags or you are willing to make the effort to edit your loose tea before you brew. If you don't meet those narrow requirements, don't buy this product."
3,"OK, but drips","I like the tea press concept, it is perfect for my lifestyle. But the actual unit that I bought dribbles way too much. I hate to complain, but the spout is way too small for pouring, in my opinion. If you pour fast, it will get caught up on the strainer, and run down the side. If you pour slowly, it will dribble. I admit I may be clumsy, and sometimes overfill the press, and it does say in the instructions to fill it 2cm (about an inch) from the top to prevent this (which makes it hold less than 4 8-oz cups), but I've found that only helps somewhat, as it still dribbles. Not to mention the tea gets cold. As a result, I'll stick with my ceramic teapot and a tea ball most of the time. In summary: -1 star for dribbling, and -1 star for cold tea and tea leaf fragments."
2,Dzindzi recommending the Pirc??,"I don't have this DVD, but I do have ""Roman's Encyclopedia of 40 Essential Chess Openings"", a serie of 4 DVD's (let's call it ""RECO""). That's why I was more than just a little surprised when I read ""Alexander""'s review:'Against 1. e4 he suggests 1. ... d6 intending 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 e5.'This looks like a transposition to the Pirc Defence (I might be wrong, since I don't know if Black fianchetto's his f-Bishop to g6 after 3.Nc3 e5). 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 defines the Pirc though, and on DVD 4 of ""RECO"" Dzindzichashvili rejects this defence against 1.e4 for Black (he only shows how to refute 1.e4 d6 2.Nf6 d4 - the Pirc - if you play White...).If I'm correct about this supposed inconsistency then people thinking of buying this DVD be aware... However, if this DVD suggests a system for Black against 1.e4 other than the Pirc, I would like to change the two stars into atleast 4, because watching a GM talking (sense) about chess for over two hours is always a cool experience."
4,An excellent choice,"I produce news programs and documentaries, and I use my GL1 to suppliment video from the professional grade cameras used by my videographers. Only a professional can tell the difference in video quality. The unit is easy to use and has performed flawlessly in the field...and I can be pretty hard on equipment. The only thing that keeps it from getting five stars is the small flip out screen...there are larger views on the market, but on DigiCams that I believe are more awkward to operate."
3,great introductory,"I got this kit because it contained the basics that I wanted, how ever I wish it had more space to add some of my own things to it. Everything was packed in tight. You could only fit one condom sized item in there, so no adding quick clot or any thing else that I would like."
3,No bad for a 70s movie,It was ok for a 1970s movie. the people could be more realistic in their acting. but all in all good.
1,Mislabeled size,"The 4-cup coffee press is in actuality just 2 cups. The number of ounces is not listed in the sales blurb... What we wanted was 4 cups at 8 ounces each. The 4-cup coffee press is just a bit over 16 ounces. While it says so on the lid of the box it came in, the ounce-capacity is not in the Amazon listing. ...So we returned it..."
1,fell apart,I purchased this backpack and it started falling apart instantly. I have been trying to return it but am having but can't seem to get any answers about that.
1,Redundant with horrible music,I agree wholeheartedly with the previous review and will add that I was only able to get through it by fast forwarding at 32x with the SOUND MUTED. Pitiful that someone could actually ruin panoramas of this beautiful country.
5,Absolutely Love This Teapot!,"I seem to drink more and more loose tea, and I find cleaning single serving teaballs a serious inhibitor toward the idea of making another cup. This pot allows me to make two cups of tea, which I find to be the perfect serving. It's very easy to use - fill the resevoir with tea, place in pot, add water, brew to desired strength, then press the plunger. It works just like a French press coffee pot. Then clean up is a dream - just rinse out the holder. And, best of all it makes a delicious cup of tea."
2,I guess I don't get it.,"I bought this thinking it was a cute and simplistic design. I did a double take on the instructions. You put the loose tea in the filter (mine is whole leaf), then pour in the water-check. Put the plunger top on and let it steep for a while-check. I don't have any issue with the plunger falling like I've read in other reviews. Press the plunger down...I get bits of tea leaf in the pot. My ball infuser does a better job straining the leaves.The instructions ended there. There's a good ounce of liquid in the bottom of the plastic filter that you cannot access because the holes are not low.Someone please explain to me why that is. There has to be a good reason.Forget pouring the contents neatly out of this contraption. Even holding the top doesn't help the tea to go to its intended destination.After a few attempts with this, its now taking up space in the back of the cabinet. Maybe I'll try to hack it or something."
4,Functional tea gadget,"I bought this teapot recently and I think it works rather well. I used it to brew Yerba Mate and the plunger stays up just fine for me all 10minutes that I let the mate brew. Very functional and pretty stylish teapot, I will admit the only downfall to the mesh is that the holes seem to be a bit large with some teas, some of my loose leaf chai tends find it's way out of the filter and onto the bottom of the pot. Other than that this pot is awesome for morning tea's I make one cup for me and one for my wife with it every morning."
4,could've been a 5 star rating but..........,"I really like this little teapot. As others have said, it's best with whole leaf tea, although using a cup strainer solves that little problem. My biggest complaint is the ""stainless steel lid"". Mine came with plastic and it broke when it rolled off the kitchen counter. I glued it back together, but...."
2,Can't even play the game,"From what I can play to it's fun and cool. The problem is that at some parts of the game it kicks me out and restarts windows. It does that when I fire my guns, or just walk up to the bugs. My pc has all the the parts it needs to play. I try everything to get it to work and still can't even beat the second level.Fun game but a pain to play with to get it to work."
2,SO Out of Date!,"My partner and I are considering becoming parents in the next couple of years, and I was psyched to find a book particularly for lesbians. Unfortunately, this book is BADLY in need of an update. While the exercises and questions are still relevant and useful, almost all the information about conception for lesbians is unusable - most of the laws referenced have been changed or updated, the legal history and precedents regarding parenting rights have become considerably more robust and clear, and the cost has skyrocketed.Additionally, I think this book reflects a 1970's lesbian feminist ethos - it's full of lots of questions to help a couple ""process"" every detail about the decision to have kids. While I don't think it's something to be entered into lightly, I do think that cultural shifts have made lesbian parenting far more normalized and far less daunting than when this book was written, and the intensive processing just doesn't seem appropriate or necessary."
1,ice maker,"Ice maker worked for a few hours and then stopped making ice, don't know why but it is no longer working.I guess that's what you get when you buy cheep!"
4,Makes Ice. Easy install,"It showed up well packaged, installation was pretty easy, and it started making ice in about an hour. What else could I ask for? It's nice to have ice once again"
3,Not quite what it used to be...,"Having known Mijares' songs for more than 10 years now, I was quite disappointed with this CD. I expected to find on it all those beautiful songs which reminded me of the happy year I had lived in Mexico, of the wonderful concert I had seen. And the songs, indeed, were all the ""classic"" ones I had been looking for, but in new arrangements -and they may be very good indeed and so is the appearance of his fellow singers, but they just don't have the original ""vibe"" anymore... So, if you know Mijares from the late 1980, you risk to be disappointed, too!"
5,Diabetic 4 yr old loves them!,"My 4 yr old was recently diagnosed as a Type 1 diabetic. As with most 4 yr olds, she likes very few foods and wasn't getting an adequate supply of protein. With the diabetes diagnosis, it was evident to us that we had to find something fairly nutritious, low in sugar, and high in protein that she would eat or she would become hypoglycemic. SHE LOVES THESE! This is one of her daily snacks and she's now beginning to thrive!"
3,"Very interesting, but too short.","Published in England. Nicely done. Lots of illustrations. Text is very interesting. The only problem is: it is too short. You can read it completely in under 10 minutes. They should have included more kings and queens and more detail on the ones they did include. Its billed as being a children's book, but the names of some of the kings and queens were difficult for me and I have a master's degree."
1,PLEASE CONTACT ME IF THERE IS A CLASS ACTION SUIT,Same story as everyone else...we purchased this television for my mom as a gift last Christmas and it stopped working a few days ago. I called Phillips and got the same run around as everyone else. I will personally be emailing the CEO and expressing my opinion about their poor customer service as well as their unethical business practices. I will also be contacting the Better Business Bureau as well as our state's Attorney General. PLEASE CONTACT ME IF THERE IS A CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST PHILLIPS REGARDING THIS PRODUCT. I WILL NOT BE PURCHASING ANY MORE PRODUCTS MADE BY PHILLIPS.
1,Dead Television,"I purchased this television on September 4, 2004. In the middle of December, about two weeks after the 90 labor warranty expired the television died in the same manner describe in other reviews. I spoke with customer support, and they said I had to pay for the labor, and drive the tv an hour to the closest authorized repair center. When I asked them if there was a defect in the tv because of all the bad reviews, the told me I was an isolated incident. After contacting consumer reports, and the Better Business Bureau, Philips finally agreed to cover all of the repairs. This was in February, about 6 weeks after it died. Took it to the repair shop, and still don't have it back yet. My suggestion is by foreign tv with an extended store warranty."
1,The worst purchase one could make,Just like the others I had a problem with the set deciding to stop working. Maybe I was lucky it lasted two years before the problem arose. I replaced the fuse a year ago and worked fine until this week. Replacing the fuse did not work this time. Four years for a television's life is terrible. I will not ever buy a Philips product again and suggest others to steer clear of their products as well.
3,Same Sad Story...,"As you will read below, this is an unreliable unit. I had the same blown fuse problem as hundreds of other owners had. By reading enough of their acounts, I was able to fix the fuse myself. Even though I will not buy another Philips TV due to the lousy customer suport and design flaw, while it still works the picture quality is actually pretty good. I like a lot of the features built in. This is one of the most affordable 27'' TVs with so many inputs including an S Video port which is great for hooking up my computer to it.Given how easy it is to fix the design flaw, if you can get a good price on the TV it might be worth it."
1,Will NOT buy another philips again!,"HAHAHH, i find it sooo funny that these TV's are such pieces of crap! same old story with all the rest, bought the TV in nov 2004, stopped powering on april 2005. will buy the $1.00 fuse to replace, i might as well buy a couple just for future problems. Its just too bad that i had to find out about this problem after the problem occured. PLEASE STAY AWAY FOR THIS TV!!"
1,Beware this television!,"You may notice that electronics retailers (Best Buy, K-Mart, etc.) are selling this model and other problem-laden Philips TV's at a substantial discount. It's pretty clear that Philips is trying to unload these awful fiasco sets any way they can.It's really a repugnant business practice and I join everyone here with a pledge not to ever give Philips (a company I once valued) another dime."
1,Same problem,"I do not know why Philips is still selling the model without fixing the problem. I bought the TV last May and it went down in August. No picture, no sound, nothing at all. When I search in Amazon I get all these reviews describing the same problem, I should have seen them earlier. Please do not buy the item if you value your money."
4,A VINTAGE COMEDY/DRAMA.,"Although this isn't quite on a par with the superlative RED DUST, it's still a treat for lovers of classic Hollywood films. Gable plays a heel - with a heart - who falls for Harlow: for Gable, she gives up her sappy boyfriend, but worries about his wondering eye. To make Gable jealous, melodrama ensues, and Harlow is sentenced in prison for 3 years. Harlow is pregnant with Gable's child, and there is a wedding ceremony just in the nick of time: soon it's Gable who does time...The sloppy, sentimental conclusion shouldn't have been, but the first half of the film is pre-code dynamite (granted, the storyline is more than a tad improbable) with crackling dialogue and leads' snappy personalities which gave 1933 audiences just what they wanted."
5,I'm the author ... and a reader in Dallas.,"I reviewed this book before Christmas as a reader in Dallas, but didn't know there was a special place for authors to review their own books. Oops! I didn't want to be misleading, so see ""A reader in Dallas"" for what this author thinks. I can't be more honest when I say this is truly a book for all ages. I hope it's as much fun to read as it was to write."
4,Great value,This is a well designed and built product. I have been using it almost every day for the last 6 months and am very happy with it. It makes consistently good coffee. I highly recommend it.
4,This French press is a beast,"This is as big as it gets for Bodum French press pots, and that's a good thing.Pros:- enormous. You can make three to four real MUGS of coffee in this thing- looks prettyCons:- the glass feels extremely fragile. I'm worried that it's going to smash to bits any day now- really pricyIf you want a monstrous French press, this is the one."
2,Disgruntled,"I love the coffee that comes out of this press, it is beyond that of any drip machine. However, the glass that Bodum uses for their presses is by far to fragile. In the past year I have gone through two beakers. I find this to be a bit crazy. A replacement beaker costs about the same as the entire press. There are plastic beakers out there, but I'd rather stick to glass. There has to be a better way. If my drinking glasses can last for years, then why can't this?"
2,"great coffee, miserable glass","My Bodum presses have always made great coffee, but unfortunately, they don't ever last very long. I think Bodum must have something wrong with the process they are using to blow glass these days. The last three of these presses (yes, three) that I've had have all cracked from what must be expansion/contraction problems since the only thing that happened before I had coffee on my feet was adding hot water to the carafe. I've been very careful with all of them, so abuse is not the culprit. If it were not for this less than minor problem, I'd give it five stars - however, since the average cost of a cup of coffee increases with the number of presses that I have to buy, I'm giving it 2 stars."
3,Gymnastics ribbon,"I purchased this ribbon last December for Christmas. It has been a lot of fun to play with for all ages from 2 years old to adult. However, within the last few weels I have noticed it has started to fray around some of the edges. This is dissapointing, but I am going to try to stop this from continuing by taping or placing glue along the edges!"
1,False alarm,"I am not a VB developer but it seems like this book is for VB developers. Authors have no idea of C++/C# programming. It has less ADO.NET but more ADO programming issues. Authors talk a lot but there is no code which makes the book worthless.Can you live without ""finally""? I can't. Author have no idea and never used ""finally""."
5,Glorious and good for the soul,"I am a big fan of movie soundtracks. I have a few favorite composers that I collect. Jocelyn Pook was not one of them, but now has been added to my list. I ordered the movie originally because I love Shakespeare adaptations, and Al Pacino and this one, The Merchant of Venice had received good reviews. I loved it. Especially because of the music, which seems to wind seamlessly through the film. There are 26 tracks on the disc, ranging from 1 minute to 4 1/2 minutes. It includes background mood music and complete songs. Without a doubt, my favorite it a long piece which plays during the movie and all through the ending credits, called Bridal Ballad. For that alone, I would have bought the whole CD. But happily the rest of it is sublime."
3,Not a new edition!,"I was disappointed to find that this book is not really a new edition of the guidebook. We used the previous edition (by Harry S. Pariser, now author of Explore Costa Rica), and we thought it much better in terms of travel information and background content. This book is clunky and hard to carry around, the maps aren't too great (compared to other guidebooks), and the color photos are decidedly mediocre! We also think that this should be labeled ""first edition"" for accuracy."
1,Disorganized,"I'm in his camp politically, but this book didn't meet my expectations. It would make a nice diary, but that's about it, useless for research or for quotation in other works. Further, I found it utterly disorganized."
1,Doesn't Jesus figure in here somewhere?,"That Reed and his followers still claim that the ""Christian"" Coalition is a non-partisian organization, remains on of the biggest jokes in American politics in the second half of the 20th century.Reed's agenda bears little if any resemblance towards the message of Jesus Christ whose commitment to the poor and outcasts was a threat to the Pharasee's (the Reed's of Jesus' time). How anyone can read the Gospel's and subscribe to this mean spirited agenda is one of the great mysteries of the 1990's."
3,Recipes - UGH! Tablescape ideas - Thumbs UP!,"Sorry, had to split the difference on the ratings for this book...my idea of a great recipe is simply NOT frozen macaroni and cheese with some red peppers and extra cheese mixed in ( the preservatives can still be tasted, added ingredients or not). Find a great cookbook instead, master some basic recipes and then turn to Christopher Lowell for ideas on table design and decoration (what he calls ""tablescapes""..that is where he really shines."
2,Boring,"Another revisionist tract that seeks to glorify the British Tommy though spinning defeats into victories, bumblers into geniuses, and incompetence into acumen. Overly long, redundant and without a single unifying theme, this book is more demanding on your patience than critical faculty."
2,It's the optics,"I won't go into too much details. I have two of these, which I purchased after my son started getting interested in birds. The optics are simply bad. The alignment of the lenses is bad. Looking through the lenses I can clearly see that the components in the two units are in different positions. The lenses themselves are bad and impurities are easily visible. And the mechanisms are bad; when trying to focus on an object, most of the image remains out of focus. I even had one of the two units replaced by Amazon shortly after I received it and the replacement wasn't any better. Six months later I decided we had to replace them. They now sit in a drawer most of the time. I would be too embarrassed to even give them away to someone, knowing how bad they are."
1,Two repairs in 7 months!,"A few days after buying, the camera started creating horizontal lines instead of pictures. Fuji replaced with a new camera at my insistence. Seven months later, the white balance broke and camera overexposed all pictures taken outside to the point where they were unusable. Fuji kept camera 5 weeks and sent me a different one without any explanation. I assume this is another used camera, not a new one. I don't expect this third camera to last any longer than the first two. Buy some other brand."
4,Consistently Good coffee,Excellant for making/enjoying consistent good cups of coffee. Use course ground coffee for best results. Cleaning out residue a little cumbersome or it would be a five star rating in my opinion.
5,Love it,"This thing makes great coffee. Clean up is not hard at all. Take the time to always rinse thoroughly. I barely use my drip cofee maker anymore, except to heat the water for my press."
2,Beware,"As much as I like the overall design of the Bodum french press, and despite the fact that it worked well the first few times I used it, I have to warn potential buyers that the press with the plastic beaker (SAN material, so-called ""shatterproof"") is not worth a dime. The beaker started showing small cracks on the third use, simply through the addition of hot water. By about 20 uses, large cracks had migrated up the sides of the beaker, causing it to crack and rendering it unusable. Nothing ever touched this beaker except coffee grounds a hot water. No stirring, handwashed. Everything was done by the book.Regrettably, Bodum customer service has made it very clear that they will not stand behind their product and replace this poorly designed component. With Bodum, you are buying looks and not quality. I suggest people go elsewhere."
3,Great if you like coffee grounds at the bottom of your cup,Makes a good cup of coffee. Convenient because it's dishwasher safe. Doesn't filter out all the grounds (even coarse-ground coffee).
4,Bodum makes great pressed coffee,"Our new Bodum coffee press makes wonderful coffee which is so easy to prepare anytime. Just boil up some water, place your freshly ground coffee directly in the coffee press (we grind our own from fresh whole coffee beans), pour on the hot water, steep for four minutes, then press! We love the fact that you no longer need a paper filter, (which take out some of the essential coffee oils). So you get a full rich brew! The only problem was we thought that this coffee press would actually make 8 cups, as it was advertised as an 8 cup press....but since we use mugs which hold 6-8 oz. each, we barely get three mugs from a full brewed pot. So this was a bit of a disappointment. Other than that, we just love the coffee we make in this coffee press! Delicious!"
5,Makes for great coffee!,Great option for a great cup of coffee. I highly recommend making coffee this way. You get the maximum benefit from the bean!
3,Glass keeps breaking for no apparent reason,"Good French press but the glass keeps breaking. Now on my third glass ($25 replacement) after about 7 years of ownership. No rough handling, no over-filling, no fast hot-to-cold.Made a batch of coffee. Poured a cup. 15 minutes later, heard a small ""pop"", huge crack down the side of the glass. No idea.If this was good Pyrex glass, I'd understand the $25 replacement, but it's apparently just a cheap formula."
1,Bodum Chambord 8-Cup Coffee Press,Item was received broken and returned for refund. Refund has not been received to date.
5,A great way to experience your coffee!!!,"I'm very particular about my coffee, and I knew that while I would be traveling to some very remote parts of Greece, I would not have the luxury of going into town for a cup of my own blend. Although on occasion I would frequent the locals and sample their fine ""Greek Cafe"" I always had a craving for the brew I know so well. I was amazed at the results I got from the coffee press. The instructions were very easy to follow and I took the time to experiment with just the right measure of grounds and water to arrive at a taste that came very close to what I would get back at my locale. The filter system on this press is one of the best I've come across and the unit itself is made of durable material. The best part is, it cleans up so easily, that I was making coffee throughout the day. A great way to have your coffee and a taste that you'll surely enjoy!!!!"
4,Nice Gift!,I recently purchased this item for a roommate. I was very happy to find that it arrived in perfect condition. It was next day aired and was wonderful. My only concern is that when used constantly it can tend to have build up of particles on the screens. I am happy with this and as she had been wanting a proper french press for years this serves us everyday for both tea and coffee. Love it!
5,Saved my dad from drinking instant!,"I purchased this French press as a birthday gift for my dad, who had been drinking instant coffee since our drip coffee maker stopped working (gag!). Needless to say, the press has greatly improved his quality of life (well, in terms of coffee drinking), and on a recent trip home I was also pleased with this press. It's just like any other French press, as in, you pour hot water over the grounds, let 'em brew for a bit, press said grounds, and enjoy. Nothing to complain about there! It's a good size for 2-(maybe)3 people, depending on how much coffee you like to drink and how strong you made it."
3,"It's OK, but not as it's hyped","After seeing a french press on TV and reading the reviews I wanted one of these things to get the ""greatest cup of coffee ever"". After following the directions and recommendations on using it for about a month I can say that I have not noticed any big difference from the drip coffee I used to make. The press does take an insignificant amount more of effort than a drip maker but it's not hard to make or clean. I just haven't noticed any more flavor, richness, or aroma in the coffee to justify the cost of the press. I'm going to go back to the drip coffeemaker for everyday coffee making and use the press only when I want to ""impress"" somebody. LOL"
3,Good for table presentation,"Ok, I bought this because this is supposedly the best way to make coffee. Does it make a good cup of coffee? Sure does, but trying to figure out how much grounds to use and having to try to get all those little gounds out of the mesh filter at the bottom is a real drag. I found I actually prefer the nice neat package the grounds are removed in via the cone filter from my other machine. I do use this when company comes over... but not if I know I will be needing more than 4 cups."
4,Bodum Chambord 8-Cup Coffee Press,makes a great cup of cofee only small drawback is it dose not keep your coffee warm.
5,Best of Both,"The Bodum Chambord Coffee Press is sleek and elegant, and, more importantly, makes great coffee. It is simple to use, easy to clean, and, more importantly, makes great coffee. The 16 oz size is appropriate for two people. After using the product for multiple weeks, I would suggest heating the water as close to boiling as possible and letting the grounds steep in the water for 5-6 minutes, rather than the 4 minutes the instructions call for. I have not had any problems with the glass, but I do wash the product by hand after each use. I am an avid coffee drinker and highly recommend this product."
2,I got a bad one,i happen to have one of the bad one. The metal was bent so it stands on only 3 legs. Also the glass is very loose and tend to fall out of the metal cage when you pour. The product definitely works and its beautiful. There are just those little defects that left me unsatisfied.
1,Breakable Bodum,"While the carafe on the Bodum is unbreakable, it did not take long for the filter assembly to fall apart! Despite careful use, the plastic pieces cracked within 6 weeks of purchase."
4,Coffee STRONG,It is very good and fast at what it does. it works faster than a normal coffee pot and personally stronger in flavor. love it recommend to all coffee drinkers especially those at work who want a cup at work.
4,So far so good,"I use the coffee maker about twice a week and it does what it is suppose to do, make coffee. It looks decent, but it is made of glass so I worry that it is going to break by myself or one of my lab mates. In general it is a good deal.P.S. If you plan on making coffee for 2-3 people this is the size of press you want. Dont go any smaller than the 30ish oz. It has a footpirnt about the size of coffee grinder (a little taller) if space is an issue."
2,Far too fragile,"This makes great coffee, as does any French press. The problem is that these are far too fragile. I am extremely neurotic about taking care of my kitchen tools, but despite that I have already cracked two Bodum French presses.I hand wash and ensure they never get banged around but despite this they always develop hairline fractures after a year of use. I have dozens Reidel glasses, but this is the most delicate thing in my kitchen.After cracking two I gave up and switched to a BPA-free plastic french press. Same quality coffee, no stress."
4,Compelling and meaningful,"I have read Sheri Reynold's books backwards, chronologically speaking. I still enjoyed all three immensely. Reynolds distinct style of storytelling carries through her work. All her characters are unique, yet somehow familiar. The main character in Bitterroot Landing, Jael, struggled and fought as a true heroine in a most untraditional role. Though her story was graphic, I didn't find it gratuitous or purposely shocking. It was an amazing tale about strength of spirit, and an interesting study of coping mechanisms. I believe there are survivors like Jael all around us, and Sheri Reynolds characterizations in her novels are right on target."
5,Daily Spiritual Readings for a Season,"Indermark offers daily scripture readings and reflections based on the text of Genesis. His approach is unusual for he deals strictly with the Genesis text and yet, his is a Christocentric approach in that the reflections are appropriate for the season of Lent as readers move toward the passion and resurrection of Christ. Indermark's reflections feel very contemporary and breathe a new sense of relevance to this old biblical book."
2,Review,"I bought this manga with high hopes, because I've decided to collect all the CLAMP manga I can get my hands on. I found the story nonsensical, hard to follow, and borderline hentai.Maybe I had the wrong impression of this manga, but I was expecting a storyline-- not a few pages of crazy stripping, then a new ""chapter"" where it all happens again. I'm still keeping it, cause it's CLAMP, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. -.-"
2,Installation Issues,"For the most part I am really happy with this product. The installation was really easy, until I got to the point of installing the ""leveling bracket"". When I attempted to install the leveling bracket I found that there was no screw hole on the on the bottom of the icemaker to accommodate the bracket. (This is where I become disgruntled with the seller of this product.) I contacted the seller for technical support and was told by their customer service that they only sell the product, they don't offer any technical support and I needed to contact Frigidaire or hire a professional to complete the installation. Not good customer service in my opinion.I went on to complete the installation and put a piece of Styrofoam between the icemaker housing and the freezer wall to ""level"" out the icemaker. The icemaker is in and works really well. The price is good compared to other sellers and as an after-market install its really easy to do ."
2,Celestron Power Tank - Poor quality item - 7ah unit,"I purchased the Celestron Power Tank 7ah from Amazon to replace a similar unit from another manufacturer that quit charging. I opened the box, read the instructions, tried to charge the battery per instructions. As soon as I plugged the charger in the 110v outlet, the charger sparked and died. Can't find another 15v charger so am charging with a 12v charger which seems to charge the unit.This seems cheaply made for the cost ($68 with tax). I don't use it for a telescope but as a 12v power supply for other small items. I am disappointed in the unit but will keep it until it dies, which probably won't be long."
1,Not the quality I expected,"I heard a great deal about what a superb product this was. Unfortunately, I've had the opposite experience. I received mine yesterday through OPT by way of UPS. The flashlight was broken internally and didn't work. The floodlight had one of the swivel ears broken. Celestron said send it back and they would repair or replace it at their option - with a wait of 4 to 6 weeks! Their repair facilities have been remodeled and that is part of the delay. I am not impressed with Celestron and will not consider them for any future astronomical purchases! I hope I can find a similar product from another source. I suppose this might be a decent product if you can pick it up in person and inspect it but I wouldn't count on Celestron standing behind it."
2,Might have liked it if it had worked.,"Actually it was damaged. It would not seat in my printer. I had to put old one back in (with a little life left) and order this from someone else. May be just my order. Good news, Amazon let me return it with not problems."
5,Best Headache Book I've Seen,"I have read through most of the headache books that I've been able to find. This book is a cut above the rest of them. I just got the new edition of Headache Help, and it does go into great detail about all the medications I'm interested in. What separates this book from the rest is the incredible length and depth which the book delves into all these various headache medications. It is a great book to use to help you with your doctor, and as a reference for the different headache medicines and approaches."
2,Teeny tiny,"Nowhere in the description of this product did it state that it was only six inches tall, and made three (4 oz) cups. What a disappointment!"
4,"Good coffee press, but..........","Good coffee press, but it doesn't begin to approach 3 cups of actual capacity. In fact, it doesn't quite make one full mug, but it works great and the quality is good. Only complaint is over rated capacity."
2,"Warning: Not 3-Cups, Only 12-oz capacity","While well-made and with that old-world style I wanted, this is NOT a 3-cup coffee press. The capacity on this brewer is only 12-oz. To be fair, this fact was listed in the fine print of the description, however I still think it is dishonest to label this as a 3-cup coffee press.I don't have 4-oz cups of coffee, and even if I was generous and allowed that my mug held a ""cup"" of 6-oz, that'd still only make this a 2-cup brewer. Cups have 8 fluid ounces, not 4.Bodum won't get any more of my business, and I will be much more careful in my future purchases."
3,Three cups in Lilliput,"This press is advertised as three cups. It does not fill one regular sized coffee mug. I use it on occasion to brew one cup of evening decaffeinated coffee. It does that well, but to call it three cups is deceptive."
3,Beautiful French Press but...........,"This is a beautiful and elegant french press but since it only brews 12 ounces is more appropriate as a single cup (Americans like their coffee mugs) unit. The unit is described as three cups, but that is 4 ounces each such as an espresso shot or a demitasse portion.Frankly I picked up a 30 ounces french press from the same company at my local Starbucks and it's great for those two mugs of fresh brewed coffee in the morning for my hubby and I. And it costs less than the Chambord but has a plastic holder and lid. The ""guts"" are still the same. So for everyday use or when we go camping, that will be the unit.The Chambord will be used to single servings such as in my home office or a mid day coffee break.As usual, Amazon processed the order and it was delivered quickly. No complaints on their customer service! Merry Christmas, everyone!"
4,perfect for one person,"I love this press because it's the perfect size for one person; a quick cup of java in the morning.If you're making for more than one, I'd recommend a bigger size though."
3,Beaker Breaks Easily,The thin glass beaker broke after just a few uses with very little provocation. I've noticed that many others had the same problem and I don't understand why they can't make a more substantial beaker for this coffee press.I ended up finding a coffee cup that the metal press will fit into and this is working fine. I would have ordered another beaker but I'm sure it would have suffered the same fate as the first one.Go ahead and buy one but as soon as you get it make sure that you have a back up coffee cup with the same inside diameter as the beaker ready to go because it's going to break.
5,Makes terrific coffee!,"Excellent coffee press! I wish I would have bought the larger one though, for 12 oz. doesn't fill my mug."
3,False Advertising on Cup Size but Good Product,"It really brews only one cup of coffee by most standards.By Starbucks standard, 3/4 of a cup (tall).But, it is a good product."
2,Extremely fragile,"No question that this makes a good cup (not cups, one cup) of coffee. But when I tried to dislodge the grounds from the bottom with a light tap, the carafe shattered. I wouldn't consider buying another, because if I have to soak it for a long time, dump the grounds into my sink, and then empty the sink strainer into the garbage (after every single cup of coffee!), there's no way it's worth the effort."
5,An Honest Portrayal,"This is an excellent example of what manga can be. It is honest, thoughtful and merciful. It is about a group of very young adults who are into a culture that can seem childish to the outsider, but can also be laced with brutal reality, and moral sensitivity. The artist strikes a wonderful balance between panels that need text to convey the story, and panels that need no text because the artist is confident that we will understand the emotions of his characters. The only cardboard characters are those in the background. I suspect that those who are under sixteen years of age will have difficulty getting the full impact of this story. The best manga that I have come across."
5,New Favorite,"This is the funniest thing I think I've ever read!There's no cheesy sci-fi/fantasy stuff or day dreaming girls trying to get married. The situations are realistic, which makes them even funnier. If you've every dated a super dorky guy or find that you're spending your free time watching anime (almost exclusively), you'll really enjoy this manga."
3,Worthy telling of West-Islamic relations history,"Fair minded account of relations between Europe and Islam through history. Somewhat more coverage of Russia and Central Asia than typically found. Puts 'religious' factor in perspective when describing social, economic, political, and diplomatic inter relationships. There is little coverage of important 'colonial era' relations; cultural misunderstandings; economic globalization; Western interference against Democratic efforts in the Middle East. Most of all the author continues unfortunate habit of describing 'Islam' while ignoring that most Muslims live in Asia (like Lewis, Huntington, and the rest almost to a man). Still,this is much better than many books attempting to cover the story."
3,Just OK,Buy these if you want to give them to children. The quality is reflected in the price so don't be let down if you just use them once a year and don't need a clear view.
4,adorable,"I recommend this film if you are in the mood for a charming romantic comedy with some sports action and some beautiful scenery. What fun! And Bill Nighy is, as always, the perfect ""bored rich man with dry sense of humour."" Very sweet."
3,ED WESTWICK IS CUTE......BUT SO IS BILL NIGHY!,"This is a cute Rom-Com. Predictable plot line and simple storyline but it is set in the Swiss Alps so the scenery is beautiful!Ed Westwick (aka Chuck from Gossip Girl) is adorable and very chic speaking in his true British accent. Bill Nighy is sexy as ""Dicky"" his father!!! Brooke Shields as the overbearing snobbish mum is just okay- a bit of an odd casting choice there.But overall humorous and light.I would rent it not buy it."
5,Works Well,"I bought a pair of these to use when working on my car. (A Toyota Corolla) These are bright, and built pretty sturdy. I kicked these under my tires and the car didn't even budge an inch. I would also like to add that I was working on asphalt and not dirt or grass. I would definitely recommend these to use with small cars."
5,An Accurate Period Drama,"This film beautifully captures the ""feel"" and history of the McCarthy era in America.The performances were all top-notch, and the script remained true to actual events of the time.Even viewers who know very little about what happened during America's obsession with Communists in the early 1950's are sure to enjoy this very accurate period drama.Recommended."
2,"CBS, Operation Mockingbird, and Joe McCarthy","Clooney's film does not delve into Joe McCarthy's preliminary investigation of CIA covert activities and how CBS chairman William Paley, Fred Friendly, and Edward R. Murrow were part of the Agency's Operation Mockingbird to provide deflection and cover of the Agency's ""family jewels"" of the day.CBS News president Sig Mickelson (1954-61) was liason to the CIA."""
5,Good Night and Good Luck,Excellent history and documentary type movie. Represents the events of the 50's in the US. I highly recommend this DVD to any history buff.
