4,Mish Mash Of Songs,"This is a mish-mash of different songs. I bought this CD to get the hard to find 'Laurie' by Dickey Lee (rare true stereo). You remember this song don't you? It's a spooky song about a guy who meets a girl at a dance, but there's just one annoying problem - - this girl has already assumed room temperature. I once had a date with a girl like that. But anyway. . .Most songs on this CD are in true stereo. Only tracks 1, 9 and 15 are mono."
4,Works,"Well, it works well with my Olympus c5050.I haven't had a problem yet.Copy/cut/paste/format .. over and over again, andno problems."
4,"Nice shoes, but ugly.","They hurt the first two days I ran in them (arch support). But after that I loved them. Light, and plenty of cushion. Other than the fact that they are butt ugly because of that gold toe, I love them."
2,Hard to clean,"I was given this rice cooker as a gift. Had it a few years now and it still works fine other that the lock for the lid broke after a couple years. The rice turns out fine but it takes a little long. Don't use the ""warm"" feature because it will just burn your rice on the bottom. Its biggest flaw is it's a pain to clean. Cooking makes a mess of the whole appliance. You have to break out a screw driver to remove the lid and clean it properly. If i had to do it again I'd return it for a product with a removable dishwasher safe lid."
3,not great,"This rice cooker has worked reliably for 3 years, but it has never excelled. I have friends with rice cookers that keep the rice warm and perfectly cooked for many hours----this does not do that. It cooks the rice, but often scalds the layer of rice touching the pan, and if I leave it in the cooker on the warm setting, the rice becomes inedible. It performs best with standard long grain white rice, and less well with brown or wild rices.If I just want to throw a bunch of white rice in and take it out immediately after the cooking cycle is over, it's just fine. But if rice is a major part of your diet, you might want to invest in something else."
4,"Love it, but the instructions are too vague",I love this cooker. Wish I'd had one years ago. My only complaint is the instruction manual. It does not offer enough information. The main problem I've had is that I can't figure out how to properly reinsert the steam vent after cleaning. The directions are no help at all. I would be delighted if someone on here could advise.
5,Best $35 I've ever spent!,"This is the world's best rice cooker! And it has a steaming tray on top so you can cook your rice and veggies at the same time. I have celiac and can't eat lots of grains so a rice cooker is a necessity but this one is both inexpensive and incredibly useful. Also has a 12-hour timer and an auto-warm feature. Try it, you'll like it! 8)"
1,Suk Yo Ching Ching Chong,Me likey the rice. Me cooky the rice. Me cooky the rice long time. Me cooky white rice rice. Me treat white rice real good American cowboy. Twenty five dollars. OK you have good time now. NEEHAW!!
3,Does it's job,"It's a good rice cooker for the price. I didn't want to drop $100+ on a zojirushi rice cooker even though I would have loved to if I had the money. I've only used it to cook rice so I don't know about the food steaming feature. The rice comes out fine, but the ""warm"" feature that's supposed to keep the rice warm tends to dry out the rice and burn/harden it if you keep it in for over a couple hours. But other than that it does it's job, and it's less than $40, so I guess I can't complain."
3,"Rice cooks fine, takes forever.","The rice cooks up just fine in this rice cooker - and it's a pretty good price. However, it takes such a long time to cook a few cups of rice. Previously I had a really old Sanyo rice cooker that cooked rice in 15 minutes or so. I find this one taking upwards of 30 minutes."
1,Didn't last very long!!,"Our old rice cooker quit working so, we bought the Aroma 8 cup at Target. It worked great for about 2 months and then it just stopped working. As it was from Target and we didn't have the original box or receipt, we are unable to return it. My husband tried to fix it and checked all the electrical pieces of the machine and couldn't find out why it just stopped working. When it did work it was a really nice rice cooker. The pan was really easy to clean and the digital buttons were nice. It even had a delayed cook time on it...I just wish it had last longer the it did."
4,Rice steamer,I always wanted a rice steamer and was skeptible about buying one...i already have so many kitchen gadgets I absolutely love this !!
4,Great combo rice and other food cooker at the same time.,Great combo rice and other food cooker at the same time. The wife is just learning to list but isn't dificult.
2,Mixed bag,"PROS:CheapCooks rice, including brown riceOne-button operationAttractive designInner pan is removableQuality of cooked rice is good as long as you remove it immediatelyCONS:Cord too shortEnd of cooking alert signal sounds like a smoke detectorBlows steam out the top and warps cabinetsKeeps rice warm, but actually cooks it onto the side of the inner pan after an hour or soDoesn't shut off the automatic ""keep warm"" heater, even after you remove the inner bowlInner bowl is not dishwasher safe and is difficult to clean, especially if you leave rice in there ""keeping warm"" longer than 1 hourIf I had to make this decision again, I would buy a better rice cooker. This one is cheap, and I love the convenience, but I am disappointed with its performance."
1,Good cooker but takes way too long,I purchased this cooker based on the great reviews. It does a good job cooking but takes too long. It usually takes around 45 min to cook 2 cups of rice. The slow cook time is why I've given it a poor rating. I'm looking for a new cooker that cooks in 10-15 min like my old one. I wouldn't recommend this if you're used to a fast cooker.
5,this was a great soundtrack that just put me in a Starwars,I thought this was a great cd that almost made me want to go try to play the score on the piano
2,Would be better without the background music and racial overtones,"I purchased this CD to listen during a long car trip with my 4 & 6 year old. It started out fine, and the author has a wonderful voice...until the background music began. At first it did not bother us, but at other times, the music was to the point where it distracted us from the story. Would have been better with NO background. We persisted with the CD - Hank is indeed a fun character for old and young alike - and then the coyotes were introduced. I do not think my kids picked up on on it, but it brought back recollections of denigrating portrayals of Native Americans. The word choice and intonation came across as condescending. It made me so uncomfortable to listen to that I can not recommend this to any of my friends. I will give it to the local library because perhaps others have a different point of view. After all, 50 other reviews on this site gave it 5 stars."
5,"Hank, my hero!",These books are well-written and fun to read aloud with lots of expression. I love the perspective. Very good choice.
1,Waste of money,This book is with lots of mistakes and not useful on eitherejb concepts or using the JBuilder for building your components.Its a waste of money.I bought this book from Borders store and I am going to return it.
5,Recommended book,This book was very easy to read. It was written in plain english and it walked me step by step from basic Java Beans right on to Enterprise Java Beans...I wholeheartedly recommend this book
4,Pretty Good book,"I liked this book. It started out with four chapters of standard Java Beans. Some EJB writters forget that there are readers out there who simply don't know anything about Java Beans at all. If you do know basic Java Beans then you can skip that section.The book was well written with clear code examples. I would have preferred more complex examples, but the book is geared towards teaching someone EJB, not taking an EJB programmer to the next level, so the examples where probably appropriate.I also wish it had been longer. I thought the book was a bit too short, and probably could have gone into more depth with an additional 100 pages or so."
2,"Ambitious, but inadequate.","Overall, it's disappointing. The book merely scratches the surface on a wide range of topics and therefore is only slightly useful for someone who already knows what processes are or can build a kernel. Still haven't found a replacement for O'reilly's Understanding the Linux Kernel, which has detailed coverage of such topics as processes, scheduling, and memory management."
2,Sample Chapter Disappointing,"I didn't purchased the book yet. I downloaded the sample chapter ""Scheduling and Kernel Syncronization"" and found it quite disappointing.1. Key to scheduling is its behaviour in multiprocessor system. You don't need a book to understand it's behaviour on a uniprocessor; kernel code itself is straight forward2. Talks about spin locks without mentioning that they are mostly used (and needed) in multiprocessor system3. Glaring erros like calling spin_lock_irqsave() and unlock by spin_unlock_irq()The sample chapter should be the best chapter of the book. If this is the best chapter then the book is a disappointment."
4,"Solid product, but won't charge an iPod touch","Product works great and offers a simple ad-hoc solution for using the ipod in any given car.However, beware that even though it says it 'supports' the iPod Touch and other later generation devices, it won't actually CHARGE them unless you have a charging adapter (Scosche Charging Adapter), which is another 25 bucks."
4,M. Lazhar,Interesting movie about an immigrant and the past he carries which gives him the compassion and perspective he needs to help his young class grapple with the loss of their teacher who committed suicide.
5,Great moisturizer with wonderful scents,"Hempz moisturizer lotion (Age Defying and Cumcumber & Jasmine) really moisturizes and makes my skin feel silky, and it smells very nice. I have been using for a while, getting it from my nail salon. The only problem was the $22 it cost there. I was very pleasantly surprised at the Amazon price of $11.95, and no shippping costs since I am Prime member. I just wish other Hempz scents were also Prime eligible."
4,Works Great,"My skin was so dry due to medical reasons when I first started using this that I had to use TONS! It absorbed very quickly into my skin (almost too quickly as I could hardly work this in) and I had to keep reapplying it. Thankfully, this really is not greasy. I was afraid I would go through the whole bottle in less then a week. After a few applications, I found that I used much less and my skin looks and feels great.My stomach after 2 children was all saggy and had many folds, much like the face of a bulldog. After the first use, my skin was smoother and appeared more toned, like I only had the one child. I am finding that the quality of my skin continues to improve.Based on results alone, I would normally give this 5 stars, however there is one little problem. It smells like, dare I say it, an old lady. Thankfully the smell is mild enough that I can cover it up fairly easily."
2,Time Out,"AGAINST TIME is a dreary little film meant to be uplifting. It's the story of ""Z.T."", a popular, handsome high school ballplayer and down-cellar inventor who is suddenly visited by himself as an old man, ""Zack."" Zack's a sloppy, weeping drunk who has come back through time to warn himself not to foul up his life.It's a good premise, a kind of serious version of BACK TO THE FUTURE, but Z.T. is too slow to recognize himself in Zack, and Zack is too slow to get to the point. Instead, Z.T. and Zack do a kind of mopey nostalgia dance around each other while not-so-pleasant things happen to the people in Z.T.'s life.This is a cautionary ""carpe diem"" tale about how life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans (to quote John Lennon), but it would have been better had Z.T./Zack been just a little less self-absorbed and just a little more interested in the people he/they value."
5,An excellent devotional for men.,"As I struggle to renew my faith and walk with the Lord Jesus, I find this devotional Bible an excellent way to start and end the day. It's comforting how each daily devotion seems to address deeply personal issues regarding my feelings and concerns regarding being a better husband, father, and, most importantly, a better Christian. Highly recommended."
3,Devotional Bible,"My husband was happy with the bible and realized it was used but it has the previous owners name inscribed on the cover, would have like to have known that."
3,A little gross,"I got this book at the local library for my son and couldn't help but get sick to my stomach reading it. Even my son thought the snot part was gross. It might capture some kids attention, but it wasn't for us."
4,Tori Amos for Easy Piano,"I love tori amos, but this book makes her songs sound.. just not quite right. They make it easy piano, the layout is nice with chord symbols and full lyrics.. but compared to the actual song, i feel like they leave out some very important tones which bring the song together and make it a TORI song. But its great if you want to figure out the skeletons of her songs and then add in more as you go a long."
3,Detailed look at Microsoft,"This book provides a very detailed look at the inner workings of Microsoft. It describes the battles within the company to determine how to change in the face of the internet revolution. The author provides tremendous detail, much of which is taken from email correspondence made public by the antri-trust case. Some of the detail may be a little dull for some. My major problem with the book is with the author's premise that Gates has ""broken"" the company by not adapting to the internet quickly enough and instead focused on protecting and extending the windows dynasty. Nobody has really figured out how to make money off the internet, so why blame Microsoft? Gates did protect the Microsoft cash cow (windows). The internet has not made windows extinct, at least not yet. I think a little time is required to see if Gates' strategy was the right one or not. However, still a very worthwhile read for any interested in Microsoft and the PC industry."
2,Not up to Picano's usual level of brilliance,"The author James V. Smith has said in his advice to novelists: ""Save nothing for your next novel."" Picano took that advice to heart...in his last novel. This one certainly does not live up to his past writing and comes no where near ""Like People in History"" which I thought was well-developed and very moving. Despite the protagonist/narrator saying how much he loved his wife, I wasn't convinced. In fact, I didn't feel any passion between the 3 main characters. A ghost was mentioned early in the novel...must have been referring to the ghostwriter."
1,Thincam,"I bought this product wanting a inexpensive digital cam for my wife. right out of the box it didnt work. it wouldnt keep a charge for more than 20 minutes and even worse, wouldnt take a single picture.my wife spent several hours on the phone with Oregon scientific tech support. the sum total response she got is ""Dunno, it doesnt work""not very helpful"
3,good movie but a little depressing,good movie - excellent delivery. We enjoyed the movie but the ending was very depressing. And the beginning seemed ridiculous. I kind of wish we hadn't purchased it. I did so on the recommendation of a friend.
2,Dont say you dont like it!!,"For the film critic from Canada, I find it interesting that you posted a review saying you loved this movie yet you discouraged someone with a different opinion from posting his review. What, is everyone's opinion supposed to be the same as yours? How boring! I agree that Roberto was begging for laughs, and begging to be loved. The whole first half of this movie was bizarre slapstick. Then it segued into a serious drama that to me was incredibly unconvincing. One can argue that this is a fantasy, but I believe the Holocaust deserves a more accurate portrait. The concentration camp reminded me of something built on a Hollywood backlot. I did find the ending to be surprising and effective, but what came before was merely average. For real humor (though dark), and an intense depiction of the horrors of the Holocaust, I would recommend Schindler's List. Life is Beautiful was just too cloying and scattered."
5,A comedy about the holocaust?,"I was sure that such a thing was impossible---a comedy set during the Holocaust and it would be good. Well, it wasn't good...it was GREAT! This lovely little movie is so charming and so sweet, I don't know how anyone could dislike it. I do realize that the star, Roberto Benigni, sometimes is over the top and tends to annoy some people but that is so far from the truth involving this film. We see his character meet a beautiful woman and his attempts to woo her. When they fall in love, marry and have a child, all seems perfect---until World War II and the beginning of the Holocaust. When he is taken, along with his son, to the concentration camps, it is so touching to see the lengths he goes to, as a father, to hide the truth of their actual situation. Roberto Benigni won an Oscar for his role and the film won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. Both were well deserved. I highly recommend this film."
4,8th Best Film of 1998,"Life Is Beautiful is a surprisingly effective film about fathers and sons and the love that connects them. It is very flawed, and occasionally manipulative, but all in all, it works very well. I do take issue with Roberto Benigni's winning of the Best Actor Oscar, which should have gone to either Nick Nolte or Ian McKellen. Still, a good film."
3,Two topics difficult to mix in a movie,"Grief and happiness, pain and joy, laughing and crying... choose the words. Two such contrastable feelings being mixed in one single movie. The intent is good, but the result was not that good for me: You are just enjoying the last joke you heard in the movie when you have to watch a scene of sorrow, and vice versa.Try eating hot Mexican or Indian food and your favorite sweet cake, at the same time, not one after finishing another. You'll understand what I mean.The movie becomes superficial: you can't enjoy the jokes at their best because you are expecting some sad parts to come and, again, vice versa."
5,It's so very good,"I like this movie because it's so funny and yet it's also so very, very serious. It deals with the holocaust but yet you can laugh all you want because it's a comedy, you know? Plus that Roberto Begnini is so cute. I could go for him. I also like this movie because it's a foreign film, so liking it makes me feel sophisticated."
2,Life is Beautiful MOVIE,"The movie itself was great, the quality as the seller described was bad. It has scratches and skips on the best part of the whole movie."
3,LETS BE HONEST,"This movie was more over rated than KISS. Okay so the boy gets to ride in a tank at the end. I've rode in a tank... but do i have an oscar. No. If you will excuse me i have to go was the pizza out of my mouth that went rancid will i was watching this movie. Okay it wasn't that ad, i recomened it to forein film lovers and frat boys."
2,Boy Is This A Stupid Movie,"Forty years ago Hogan's Heroes worked because it was pure farce and its German POW camp was acceptable as a setting for a comedy, while Life Is Beautiful failed in large part because a German concentration camp is not a place to set humor. I was told this was a charming movie with a lot of joy within it. ""Joy despite the misery,"" is what someone said. I found it ridiculous, boring, and an insult to the memory of those who were murdered by the Third Reich. Roberto Benigni wasn't funny, just manically irritating. The actor needs either animal tranquilizers or a punch in the mouth, I'm not sure which. Maybe both. Life Is Beautiful was a horrible film that shocked me with its idiocy, far-fetched plot turns, and overall annoying awfulness start to finish. How filmgoers ever fell for this incredibly unfunny waste of time baffles me."
2,Life Is Not So Beautiful,"I am not doubting Roberto Benigni's talent for he certainly has talent. What I do doubt is how good this film really is. This is one of those films where at the end I was so depressed and it pretty much ruined what was left of my day. The film is set up as a romantic comedy that is just so lavish and well done. By the time the first half was up I felt like it was the happiest film I had ever seen. Then came the dreadful second half which takes place in a Nazi death camp. Sure there is some extremely dark humor in this last half but it reaked of ""Shindler's List"" and the conclusion is not exactly uplifting either. I believe the film would have been much better if it stuck to either the first half or the last throughout the entire film and not setting up something wonderful and than ending it with tragedy. That's the worst joke anyone could pull and I for one did not appreciate the film at all."
5,My favorite movie!,"Although a movie set in the time of the holocast could be very depressing, this movie is a love story about the love of a man for his wife and his son. It is such a beautifully written story, I could watch it over and over. The father uses humor and game playing to get his family through time in a concentration camp when everything else seemed hopeless. I would recommend the voiceover edition rather than the subtitles."
4,"Great Movie, so-so DVD","What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said before? Of course it's one of the best movies of the last twenty or so years. It's one of my favorite movies, and definitely should have been in the running for best picture.Why the 4 stars, then? Because, as much as I love the movie, the DVD really isn't anything special. There's a dubbed and a captioned version, a few commercials, and a trailer. That's about it. Unless you only own a DVD player, just purchase the VHS version and save yourself some money!"
3,Portuguese subtitles??? Where???,"This DVD doesn't have portuguese subtitles. The back cover inform that are the portuguese subtitles, but it's not true!"
1,Creepy,"To make a such a movie about the Holocaust would require an extraordinary actor, who could convey the contradictory desire to spare his son and simultaneously feel the horror of being shipped to a camp. Instead, all I saw was him literally trying to make a big joke out the experience, I think because Benigni isn't capable of portraying fear while being a clown. Especially awful was the ""funny interpretator"" shtick for the Nazis. It was just so icky to me. I was shocked that he won Best Actor, though of course that is consistent with the travesty of the Oscars. It wasn't a true story, but at the end the boy claims ""This is the story of my life"" as if this were true life story. It was a cheap trick. Very dishonest."
5,Standing ovation...even from the best actors in the world,"During the Acadamy Awards this year Hollywood was greeted by a truly amazing surprise... money and glamor is not needed to make a masterpiece. Life is Beautiful is a simple film...no special effects, dramatic action or heart-straining adventure...the movie is simply a portrayal of the poweverful meaning of love. It truly touches the heart and brings both laughter and tears to anyone. How often do you see a gang of highschool teens, an elderly couple, and young moms and dads all laughing and crying together? The film is, of course, all in Italian, the lovely language complements the film and is a perfect background melody. I truly recommend this film, not only because of its genuine, deep meaning but also because it helps the human soul escape from the daily troubles of life and to notice that Life truly is Beautiful."
5,ETMR - Life is Beautiful,"1. Humanity: How does Guido express the human quality of endurance?2. Implications: Life is Beautiful expresses the need for family strength. What does this mean for today?3. Evolution: Life is Beautiful employs a style that is at first jarring to watch, and then succeeds on its own as a force of comedy. How has this affected cinema since its release in 1998?4. Realism: Is the game Guido plays with his son feasible realistically?5. Stageplay: The basic story is one of a man trying to remain optimistic during a time of intense suffering. How does the light-heartedness of the plot change the realistic consequences of the Holocaust?"
4,"Worthy of ""Best Foreign Film""","I loved this film. It made me laugh and cry. Films that deal with the Holocaust usually can't make you laugh. The thing I didn't like about this film is that it was not realistic at all. It was beautifully made and sends a great message. If you want a true Holocaust story, watch ""Schindler's List"". In my opinion, that is the best Holocaust movie to date."
2,Sting at his most self-indulgent,"Sucks on so many levels, I don't know where to start. I swear there isn't a memorable song on the disc, and it's not a very good recording, besides! Sting's great voice is too far down in the mix and always seems to be right on the edge of distortion. Almost unlistenable on so many levels that it's no wonder the SACD is selling used for as little as $1.55!"
5,McWhorter is an Intellectual Force for Positive Change,"I have long been an admirer of John McWhorter and his scholarship. My background in rhetoric and his in linguistics makes us fellow travelers of a sort. But my admiration for Professor McWhorter is more a function of his courage, intellectual independence, and his fresh, crisp writing style. Moreover, his positions are always deftly argued and rooted in serious study and reflection. That he has to endure the kind of slanderous ad hominem attacks he sometimes encounters is sad. Yet, ironically enough, these actions only serve to bolster his thesis: bereft of any new ideas, the left must use race as an electoral bludgeon, a mechanism designed to ensure obeisance. And so, his critics' barbs morph into boomerangs; they backfire.Still, it's regrettable that discourse has devolved and brought us to this point. With Professor McWhorter and scholars like him courageously leading the way, perhaps we may yet still ""Win the Race."" Let us hope so."
5,Comfortable,I must say this one of the most comfortable bras I have ever worn. I actually have there on back order.
4,please plug me into something,"I am amazed at all the trash thats available , yet a diamond like this stays buried ... forever ? I found some of the songs online , but not the whole album . If anyone has any info or can make a copy off their album , please contact me . I'm talking about plug me in , not this album I've never heard ."
4,Possibly awesome?,"Some of its great, however, I can only say that because the tracks I've heard are from the ""Plug me into something"" soundtrack. I've completed this review in attempt to find ""Plug me into something"" on CD. I've looked at great length but with no success. If anyone can help, please do."
2,"Covered in coffee, loose binding, FULL of notes",Pros: This book had all it's pagesCons:Coffee stainsCovered in highlighting on almost every pageCovered in illegible notes on almost every pageLoose Binding
5,"One of Wakeman's best, yet most unrecognized gems","My Rick Wakeman collection exceeds 60 (sixty!) CDs. Only a handful of them are as beautiful, touching and inspiring as Sea Airs (IMO the best of the ""Airs"" trilogy). Each piano song on Sea Airs is exceptional and played on accoustic piano (a major plus). Title songs are spot on, giving you an idea of what is to come (ie. Sailor's Lament, The Mermaid, The Harbour, Clouds, Lost at Sea, et al). The songs are very evocative and melancholic, yet overflowing with melody and beauty.It makes no differenece if you are into heavy, power, black, doom, speed, thrash metal, pop, hip-hop or rap, Sea Airs will keep you satisfied and in complete musical equilibrium. Do yourself a favor and get this CD asap!"
4,Airs are worth the cost.,"Sea Airs, Night Airs and Country Airs are some of the best of Wakeman's new age music. Embracing a relaxed, earthy style they remind me of Pink Floyd's development of a style of music that evokes color, emotion and a sense of wonder. The dramatics are not there, but Wakeman seems to embrace his muse with affection and great respect.Definitely not elevator music but it can be played for background color in a number of different venues. All three are worth owning whether you are a Wakeman fan or not."
4,The original is usually the best,"It is well worth the money. The songs from this CD reaches out to the primal senses. Glede Ma Glede is riveting when heard in its entirety. Lucy's composition of Burial shows another dynamic aspect of Lucy's talent for singing. Gabby's Dance"" is a feel good diddy that just makes you want to get up and dance no matter where or what you are doing. Unless you read the titles, it is difficult to determine which episodes these songs first aired. The final song, the extended version of the XWP's theme song is inspiring and speaks to the Xena in all of us. It's a must have CD for any Xena fan or any music fan."
2,Poor Shelf Life - Buy Rayovac Hybrid AA's Instead,"Donating my charger & batteries to a charity thrift store. Batteries charge in 15 minutes as advertised. Batteries are so hot after charging that you cannot hold them in your hand - or put them in a camera for quite a while. Major reason I do not like them is that they rapidly auto-discharge - i.e. they go dead on the shelf within a matter of a week or usually less. Capacity is OK if you use them immediately after charging. I have Rayovac hybrid AA's & like them much better. Although they charge overnight, the batteries hold a charge for months on the shelf. This way I can charge them at my leisure & don't have to worry about remembering to charge batteries immediately before using the camera."
1,Complete Waste of Money,"I bought this product following a recommendation from a friend. He didn't recommend this specific brand or version, just cutting gel in general. Maybe there is one out there that actually does as advertised, but I highly doubt it. All I know is that this one specifically does absolutely nothing. It's a complete waste of money and time. If I could give it 0 stars I would. DO NOT BUY!!!"
2,I wanted to like it...,"When I saw that she had a new album out, I was so excited. I bought Tuesday's Child blindly on the strength of her first album...and never regretted buying before listening. Amanda Marshall is one of those artists who's so good I'd buy anything by her. I'm still amazed she hasn't become more famous here in the states.So when I saw her album at Best Buy, I bought it in a second. Sadly after listening to it a few times, hoping it would grow on me, it hasn't yet. I praise Amanda for being able to re-invent herself, but I'm not sure I like the new Amanda Marshall. She's falling into a genre I've never been a big fan of. Though, from the mixed reviews on this site, I guess some people can appareciate it. But from this Amanda fan: it's not for me."
4,Good and different,I thought this album was very good and different from other stuff I have heard lately. I think it is a must try.
4,Give it a few spins--it will win you over,"There is some fierce debate on these pages about Amanda's third album. I've been puzzled for a long time why Americans haven't embraced her, but that is another story. Speaking of stories, this album is really terrific. Not as strong top to bottom as her first two releases, this album grows on you. I was a bit surprised at first...only Marry Me and Love is My Witness sound like vintage Marshall. Nevertheless, Red Magic Marker, Double Agent, Colleen (I saw him first) and other tunes will win your heart. Amanda is expanding and taking chances. Good for her. It isn't always perfect, but after a few spins on the ol' record player, this album will be part of your regular listening schedule. Amanda is vastly talented. I love her and I've come to love Everyone Has a Story."
2,unpleasant lyrics and explicit language,"What a disappointment!!! I bought it yesterday, listened to it today and it won't make it into my house before I trade it in at the used CD store. The pleasure of a new release by a favorite artist was quickly doused. There are just enough unpleasant lyrics and explicit language to spoil songs like Double Agent, Red Magic Marker and Sunday Morning After. Brilliant strategy. ..."
5,"Everybody's got a story, but not everyone can tell it like Amanda","I love this CD and I can't wait for her next one. I have all three and I happen to like the fact that they are all different. Amanda shares a unique perspective with each new CD and I find that exciting. So many artist are predictable to the point of boredom, but not Amanda. She keeps reinventing herself. Frankly I can't wait to hear her next story."
2,"no plot, no real personalities, no point","Ugg. The promise in Rhapsody was totally lost in this book. I can't even take the time to write a decent review of it. Basically, this book has no real plot. Things happen, and then more things happen, but there seems to be no real goal for this series. The heroine Rhapsody is the most annoying mary sue ever written about, and there really is no point in reading this book. Look at the Truth series by Dawn Cook instead."
5,Great Story,"This book is well written, well thought out continuation of the Rhapsody saga written by a great writer. The story has just the right amount of lore, magic, and action while still allowing the reader to get a much better understanding of the characters especially Ashe. I enjoyed the story thoroughly and you will also. Keep 'em coming Elizabeth !!!!"
5,One of the Best Fantasy Books I've Ever Read!!!,"Rhapsody was a good book. Prophesy is an absolutely fantastic book. The first book needed a lot of time to set up the basic story, and there was a lot of stuff that was confusing. Elizabeth Hayden took all of those loose ends in Prophesy and spun the most magnificent story from it.I just simply couldn't put the book down.Everything about the story was excellent. All of the charachters, especially Achmed are terrific, and the book has all the qualities needed to make a great book: Good action sequences, intense emotional situations, comic relief, a bit of eroticism, and charachters and plots that you can truly believe in. I especially liked the scene when Ashe and Rhapsody realized who they truly were (i.e. Sam & Emily) - it really was one of the best chapters in a book I've ever read!!!I'm now reading Destiny and then Requium of the Sun, and am confident that I'll enjoy them as much as I've enjoyed the first two books."
2,Miles was right: should not have been released,"This should not have been released. The best thing about it is Summer Night. The rest sounds like outtakes. I like pre-electric Miles, but I read that Miles was furious with Columbia for releasing this and he was right. This is the weakest of the Gil Evans collaborations."
3,"Worked great, for a while","This charger worked great for me for about two years. Now the batteries will only charge in 3 of the four slots, so I cannot charge 4 batteries at a time."
2,I wouldn't highly recommend this one.,"The video was o.k., but I expected it to be more dramatic, as showing what a person has to go through while being arrested and the process of being fingerprinted, locked in a cell with other criminals, etc. this was a play and a short one."
1,Is not so secret as it seems.,"As far as the stealth part of it goes it is practicly a flash light on a pare of useless binoculars. If you have a flashlight and a pare of binoculars at home save yourself some money and disappointment. The commercial describes the toy as being able to see without the use of a flashlight (infrared). The toy has two modes to it. You can pop out a flashlight from the top for long range viewing or you can turn on the ""green light"" for quote and quote ""short range secret viewing"" I highly do not recommend this toy."
2,The power is discharged soon,The power will be discahrged completely in 4 days even you do not use it.
3,Stats,The product is fine it's stats I hate this is just because of my lack of understanding I'm sure those who use this book will find it helpful
2,Not A Good Indy Thriller,"This British indy film had received a lot of attentions and favorable reviews, mainly from British film media.The film has a simple story about 2 semi-professional(?) contractors received orders with a ""kill list"".The first 3 acts are alright with a good cast but the last act is too slight to make it a good and satisfyingthriller and doesn't justify the foregoing grisly violence."
2,Not That Good,"Of course the book is gorgeous and the author's writing is delicious, but as far as the recipes go - no way is it worth more than 2 stars. I have her other books and they're great. She should have given this one a bit more time."
2,Another Pretty Book,"There's no doubt that this is a gorgeous book. Unfortunately, I think it's better for your coffee table than your kitchen. While there are beautiful pictures (lots of Nigella) and several great recipes, the book didn't seem very useful to me. I bought and loved ""How to be a Domestic Goddess"", so, I got this book from the library to check it out, thinking it would be somewhat the same. I have to say I was dissapointed. I only found 4 usable recipes in the whole book. (Granted, I am not a gourmet chef by any means, but I do consider myself to be a lover of great food and a Good cook.) While there are some nice recipes and lots of great photos this book is a more of a ""pretty to look at"" picture book than a hard core recipe resource."
1,Paperback version of Forever Summer!!!!,"This is Forever Summer (from 2003) in paperback form. Nowhere does it seem to say this in the description. If you already own FS, you already own it...move along, nothing new to see here :(!"
3,Information is somewhat dated,"I should have paid more attention to when this book was written. The last printing was 1996. While some of the principles are basic, many improvements in techniques, disciplines, and medications have been instituted since then. As a heart patient I didn't learn anything new. This book should not be offered for sale because much of the info needs to be updated - in my humble opinion."
2,Interested Vegetarian,I have been a lacto-ovo vegetarian for approximately 30 years. I was interested in exploring a more vegan approach to eating but I thought the book was a bit preachy for my taste.
3,Reversing atherosclerosis,"This paperback edition is smaller than most paperbacks; the type is very small and crowded making it more difficult to read. The content is excellent, but I would not recommend this paperback edition."
1,I do not recommend,"I'm a veteran so I have a dietician to consult. I showed her this book and her comment was ""extreme and not healthy.""Read and follow at your own risk. Or save your money."
3,AAK25427,"This book was NOT ""like new"" as advertised. Though mildly disappointed, I bought the book for its information not for its looks."
5,Heart Diease,"My doctor recommended this book because I refused to be loaded down with a bunch of medications. Half the time I didn't take the medication until I stopped and asked for another alternative. There are no regret in my decision making. The contents in this book is saving my life. I can see some changes in cholesterol level, trigliceride level, blood pressure, and weight. Dr. Dean and I are going to reverse my heart diease."
5,Get your own guide,"I was looking to make major changes in my life and my friend let me borrow his book. It helped me enormously. It goes into great detail as to the philosophy, the mind-set, the action, and the potential results you'll experience when you decide to make life-changing decisions. The book is kind of long, but that's good, because you get to pick those portions that apply directly to your current situation. I would definitely recommend this book if you are undertaking any type of career or personal change and want some guidance, some good ideas, and a ready reference source. But make sure you can keep yours after you read it!"
2,shreds well..but won't stop,"After just a few weeks of use, this unit just won't stop, I've used compressed air to clean, remove every bits of paper I can see inside, still it just won't shut down. Funny thing is that although a different model, we had the same problem at work with this brand, I wonder if they have a bad design on the sensor.Update: I called the customer support line, and I was very impressed, I got a person on the line. They offered to replace the shredder and they offered a label for free shipping of the defective one. Once I get it I'll update. Very surprisingly, I was told that I can't leave the unit on ""I"" all the time (where it start if it detects paper). I was told to leave it on off at all time, and only turn it on when I was feeding it paper. The tech support even told me that they recommend leaving the unit unplugged as much as possible. I found that a bit strange, why have a sensor if you have to turn it on manually anyway."
3,Pretty good but can only put in a few sheets of paper per shred,"This works pretty good but I can in no way put in up to 12 sheets of paper per shred. More than 5 and it jams up. Also, I just looked at the shreds and they are quite large. This is ok for my purposes but I'm not sure I would recommend it..."
2,Great shredder + flimsy bucket = total disappointment,"The top portion, the shredder itself, is very well designed, but the bucket is made of a flimsy plastic that is hardly able to hold the heavy top. If I could rate the parts separately, I would give 5 stars for the top and -3 points for the bucket. If it was not for the desperate desire to cut manufacturing costs [Fellowes, why not to try using a paper bucket next?], it could have been a great shredder. Unfortunately, the product overall is not worth its shipping price, not to mention the $100+ price tag."
4,shredded,"We purchased this shredder after our other shredder died from exhaustion. This one works well and is quite a bit quieter and appears to have more ""muscle"". The construction seems a bit questionable as far as durability but then again it is manufactured in China. I have yet to purchase anything made in China that has the overall appearance of being constructed well! It sure would be nice to get ""Made in America"" back on most of the available products. Overall we are happy with our purchase."
5,a great shredder for a greater price,"I had many shredders that were less expensive and I know why, they burn out quickly. This shredder is quiet and will handle upto 12 sheets plus shred credit cards and cds. Check with Amazon for the fairest prices.DaveA HAPPY CAMPER"
2,"Lasted only 20 months, Very Dissappointed","Ran like a charm until 20 months later from purchase when the motor ceased on us. This unit carries a one year warranty on the parts of the unit. Since the unit does not engage at all, Fellowes indicated that there is something wrong with the PC board of the unit. The PC board for this unit would cost with shipping/handling: $66.35I thought the quality of their product was better than this."
3,Great for 6 months then minor problem,"Was great for about 6 months, then the auto function didnt work. No big deal, just have to turn on & off now."
3,So far good,"So far happy with the product. Missing handle on shredder unit, which is very heavy.Also opening of basket is not that easy."
4,works great,"I really needed this like it only wish it had wheels, it works fine , and i would buy it again price was great too."
2,"Switching to ""big"" shredder was worth it...for a while","I had been toying with the idea to switch from my 2-sheet-at-a-time, over-the-wastebasket shredder for a while but wasn't sure that a power shredder would really be any different. But this one is. Really much more powerful than my old one making shredding go quickly. Rarely jams, has never overheated. Shreds CDs and credit cards no problem.Update: A year or so into owning it the plastic bin tipped over and a small piece broke off which is necessary to push a metal lever in to make it operate. I can only make it work now if I stealthfully insert something like a nail or a safety pin between the plastic bin and the lever each time I move the bin."
3,Just doesn't quite cut it!,"The shredder is strong and tears through paper fine...cuts into little pieces as advertised but when I put it to the real test of destroying my CDs. It chocked on just 1 CD and the CD got stuck in the cutting gears. I was disappointed, I had to un-clog the CD from the motors. It working again but not sure if I will CD shred it anymore."
3,Good but I don't agree with everything in it.,"there are definitely some strong points against Paul and his teachings but I don't agree with the depiction of the Pharisees. Maccoby portrays Pharisees are a benevolent dedicated group who upheld religious ideals in the face of tyranny. This view is repeated ad nauseam through out the book. One can read historical accounts on the Pharisees and be able to see their hypocrisy, meanness, chauvinism, self-righteousness and exclusiveness in their writings and their attitude towards fellow jews and Jesus Himself.Was Paul a liar? maybe but there are a lots of holes in Maccoby's theory.I do recommend the book."
4,"Nice boots, wish the sole was more rigid","These would be perfect if the sole was more rigid/thick. Note for sizing, they say to go up if you are a half size but I had to go down (and they are still roomy)."
3,WARNING - CAN'T PLAY IT ON XBOX360,"I wish I could really rate this game.This game is listed as a ""Backwards Compatible Xbox Game"", but it is not compatible. It was later removed from that list due to bugs. Unfortunately a lot of lists have not made any corrections to this effect.If anyone does have a chance to try this on their xbox360, all I can say is: Do not download the update. I think my xbox360 downloaded 2 game updates for this game, but the game would not run. I have no idea why I would be required to download an update for a game that doesn't even work on this platform, and I wonder what would have happened if I had not downloaded the update.That's all. Don't buy it if you're expecting it to work on your xbox360."
2,Ordering Textbooks from Amazon,"I won't order books through Amazon again. It took over four weeks to get a book from someone in the states. I had to purchase the online version because I was a week behind in coursework.So now I have two versions of the books. The same thing has happened to many students I know, and I have recommended other websites to them that are much more reliable."
1,Great for 3 Seconds,"There's no doubt that Ana has major talent and is a master of the guitar. But, you'd probably enjoy this performance more if you only listened to the CD.The major problem with the DVD is that the director cuts to a different camera every 2-3 seconds! For example, when Ana goes into a ripping solo, you see the drummer's face, then the keyboard, then the bass player, then the... well, you get the idea. A good director knows to stay where the action is.It was bad directing and frustrating to watch."
4,"Cheap, light weighted, peace of mind",I bought this case when I bought my Z22. I didn't want to scratch up my PDA and so far so good. The case has done its job well. I've dropped it and placed it in my bag with loose keys and the case has minor scuffing. I'd much rather it on the case than on my PDA.The case doesn't allow you to use the screen or the buttons while closed which means the keylock is unnecessary.The case is simple to open and I've found that with a bit of practice I can open it with one hand and support it while I enter information.I bought a much more expensive case for my ipod and at the moment I'm not noticing much difference in the quality between the two.At the price it is very cheap peace of mind which can be replaced when needed.
1,"Can;t browse, won't buy................","Once again the 'search inside' feature is meaningless, because all the pictures are blanked out! They don't do this in bookstores - they can't. So buyers get to see what they are buying - and with any art or craft book, that is ALL that matters, isn't it? I woulnd't consider buying such a book without being able to see the work inside first.And I learned that from experience."
5,Wonderful Folk Style Music Choice,This poetic musician has thought provoking sound and words that will interest many. His poignant style and minstral sound is folk and more.Check it out.
3,Pretty good for the money,"I installed it to a cement patio with masonary screws, and haven't had any trouble with wind damage.The canopy material only lased for 2 years, and it's hard to find a replacement, but Target shows one on their web site (but out of stock).For the money, I think it's a good deal. Have to make sure to secure it though, otherwise it (and all others) are like kites in the wind."
1,Not for Outdoors,"I have to agree with the first review that this product should be for indoor use only or those in a climate without wind.We did not return the product after we read that the canvas needed to be removed before rain or wind, thinking it was just CYA. However after putting it up on Monday and spring storm came through on Friday. When I arrived home from work I noticed that the Gazebo was about to blow away. I held onto the gazebo to keep it from tearing my roof off and my neighbor's roof off, however over half of the metal pieces broke."
4,Common sense must prevail,It seems that most of the people who have had trouble with this gazebo erected them in the yard. This gazebo has to be constrcted on a wooden deck with perhaps some additional metal support harware added. It's very attractive (I have two) and works out just fine on my deck where it is surrounded by the deck's hand rails. The main supports are attached to the rails of my deck and bolted to the wooden floor. This makes it a lot more sturdy. These things will blow around the yard all day long. They can't be set up on grass as a stand-alone structure.
1,looks nice - not functional,"The gazebo looked beautiful and we loved it the first week we had it up, of course the weather was beautiful.<br />The first windy day we had the entire gazebo flipped over and rolled into our neighbors yard-the polls broke and canvas tore. We even had it anchored with bricks that didn't hold up. It was a waste of money."
4,Reliability is the Key,"I love the service...I recieved my product without any equivocation and in timely manner as promised - very Reliable. The only thing is that the product had somebody name written in it when I thought I had not been used before. Nevertheless, I love it."
5,Porn Fest,This is the best book I have ever read in my whole entire life. This must be the best selling book on the market.
5,I want a G string!!!,"I want to be on that tour!!! Symphony X offers a good time for all, especially the narrator. Makes me wonder how much of this is based on a true story! I happen to know that the author is a member of the band for Neil Diamond. I won't say more but if their ""off"" hours are anything like Katie's are in Symphony X, let me be a fly on the wall or a groupee!!"
1,general and texas,"The information in this book is not correct. In fact, the author provides references that do not in any way, shape, or form reflect what he writes. Because some of Andrews Raiders were from our area of Ohio, I was very interested. When I checked out the references I was amazed and disappointed that this author was making statements that were not even born out by his ""references"". Not a book I could recommend as historically factual."
4,YANG STYLE TAI CHI CHUAN 2,"I bought this CD as an aid in learning Yang 40-form Tai Chi. After three months of weekly lessons from a local teacher, I found myself getting further behind each week and unable to practice on my own without a reference of some kind. This CD works well for my purposes, and it is the only 40-form CD I have found that uses English instructions. The entire 40-movement form is demonstrated straight through from a front view while the Master names each movement and injects a few tips. Then, the entire form is repeated from a rear view camera angle. The image quality is good, but foot positions would be easier to see if there was more contrast betwee the Master's shoes and the dark floor.The last half of the CD is devloted to a demonstration of ""Push Hands,"" which is one of the self defense applications of Tai Chi techniques.I believe this title is also available as a VHS tape."
4,Very Good Pentangle,"I've picked up most of Pentangle's stuff on CD since first being introduced them in 1991. To me, Pentangle's music is what I'll be hearing in heaven, if there proves to be one. I find the combination of Jacqui McShee's beautiful voice and Bert Jansch's nimble guitar playing to be intoxicating. This album from 1994 might be the finest they recorded since reforming in the mid 1980's. The traditional numbers, including ""Oxford City"", ""The Lily of the West"", and the gorgeous ""Willy O' Winsbury"", are riveting. The band also comes up with some fine originals, especially ""Hey Soldier"". The musicanship and production are just outstanding."
1,Very disappointed,"Their age is obviously showing. The vocals were clipped, rusty, not clear at all. The rhythms were so slowed down it was nothing like the original songs. They dragged on and on. Not worth it."
5,Hittin the Note,Some things are worth waiting for and hopefully we won't have to wait another 9 years for an Allman Brothers album that is this good. There is not a bad song on this album. Haynes and Trucks sound like the reincarnation of Allman and Betts. Greg Allmans's vocals are moving. This album could have been contempory to the first two Allman Brothers albums. I highly recommend it!
5,BEST ALBUM EVER,"This album has a great blend of Southern Rock, Jazz, Great Guitars added by the great voice of Gregg Allman. This album need to be heard at least 5 times before any judgements after that it is going to take some effort removing it from the CD player. None of the previous work of the Allman brothers come close. highly highly recommended."
3,Oh dear I made a mistake,Bought this after reading the great reviews on Amazon. But I regret it now; it's definitely not my style of rock music. Though these boys certainly know how to play their music and the CD is very well produced. Very tight and altogether. This reminds me of an early 70's style of rock music and you get that feeling about the age of musicians. Anyway its interesting and these boys seem to put in an honest effort. For music I give it 50% and recording 88%.
2,DISAPPOINTING,"If you have read any of my other reviews, you probably noticed a lot of 3 to 5 stars. That is because I usually do a lot of research to finD only the best books, DVDs or CDs. If you already know your passion, than this might be good for you. However, I was under the impression this would help me find my passion. It doesn't. If you want to find your passion, you might consider ""The Passion Test, by the Attwood's or I think you will enjoy Barbara Scher to help you find your passion."
5,Terrific Book That Really Hits Home! Get It Today.,"This book is one of the best self-help books that I have read, and I read a lot of them. What makes it so good is the honest and realistic advice, tools, and stories that really hit home for me. I now understand how to benefit from my passions in life and that it is possible to have my passions be a part of my home, work, personal, and school life."
5,Healthy goodies for dogs,"My dog loves the taste of these treats. She doesn't know the difference, but I think their animal shapes are really cute. I feel as though she's getting something low fat, natural and healthy."
1,Not in same ballpark as Cane River,"While I loved ""Cane River"" and looked forward to reading ""Red River"" I was terribly disappointed. I thought the writing lacked depth and fluidity and the character development was weak. I had such a hard time getting into the novel and admit I had to put it down, something I rarely do. I unforuntately can't recommend this book, although I highly recommend ""Cane River."""
3,This movie was very interesting to watch .,You have to really watch all of it to understand it all . It looked pretty intense . It should be rated R because it has a lot of adult situations and nudity . Audults only .
2,Returning Items,This company makes it hard to return items and charges you a 20% restocking fee. Will not use this company again for future purchases
2,Not what I had expected,"Right off the bat, I'm going to admit to being only semi-literate, computer-wise. That said, I have had some experience with USB speakers. I was looking for something like I had used before, ie, one where both power and audio signal were transmitted through the USB port. This was not that. And it doesn't say that anywhere in the ""specs"" (which I put in ""quotes"" because the specification list offered here is almost non-existent). Plus, the volume is not as loud as my old, conventionally powered speakers.Spend a few extra bucks, and get a set of speakers from sellers whom are courteous enough to list ALL the specs."
1,USB speakers,You get what you pay for. I bought these just to increase the volume and they sound similar to a cheap boombox.
3,Nice but not powerful.,"If You want to cut wire or small nails they work great. Nails 3/32 inch or bigger are mostly in the difficult range, and I couldn't cut any nails nearing i/8 inch ""Like double headed framing nails"", dent them yes, but if Plumbers use them to ""cut nails"" I kind of doubt it, I'm 6' over 300 # with 10"" spread from thumb tip to the tip of My little finger, and Hairy Legged, so I guess if the nail was where I could keep turning It I could get It cut sooner or later.I have no doubt they would pull medium nails if they were sticking out far enough. I didn't nick the cutting edge or try concrete. They look great in the tool box."
1,Fell off the first day!,"I've used enough command hooks in my life, I actually follow the directions. I apply it, I let it sit, I do the whole thing. I followed those same instructions. I was hanging this on our bathroom door as a temporary hook until we could decide on a more permanent rack to put on the door. It fell down within 48 hours of me hanging the first item on it. It was a towel, a rather thin Kohls towel. Obviously I'm not satisfied. Clearly it wasn't water-resistant enough to muscle through my steamy bathroom holding a thin towel."
4,You know what these do,"These are the best of this type of hook, if you are looking, you know what these are.I use these in my shower on the tile walls, hold everything I need, no falling down. You can pull the hook off the wall base to clean, or clean under."
4,Works for me!,Bowtrol works for me. It worked even better when I was heavier. I have problems going to the restroom and it is a natural way to keep me regular.
3,"some give away 5 stars like candy, ..not me.","This is a great game for your kids. However, if your of the legal driving age or older you'll most likely wanna play something more on a Mario Sunshine level for instance. Mario Sunshine which is over a year old by now is great for kids or adults. It has something to offer all ages. This game on the other hand isn't going to appeal to all ages. As a matter of fact, while I was playing it for the first time today, I thought.. gee I could be playing something else. So I rate it 3 stars. Good for the younger gamers."
3,Spirits and spells video game,I bought this game for my daughter. It 's a cutesy game. Its alittle limited in the characters actions ie walking to running capabalitly like in other games. This game you walk down a path hitting things with your witchs hat or your pitchfork or hop onto objects at times with help from creatures in the game. Its slightly on the scary side for 5-6 year olds. My daughter likes to be kinda scared so she enjoyed the game. Its cute and fun and makes you ponder of how to get out of certain situations.
3,Some gems,"These are some good movies and at a great price... however i wish that more details had been availible in the description... the aspect ratio of these films is odd and tiny so on my tv the movie only appears in a box about the size of a sheet paper... luckily i have a better TV in my living room, but forget watching it on any other TV in the house. Minor issue... but you want to have a LARGE TV inorder to enjoy these movies."
2,"by a landslide, this is the worst Sandman","up until a few weeks ago, i never imagined in my wildest dreams that a volume of the sandman could by bad. then i read the train wreck that is VOLUME 10: THE WAKE. i'm not saying that this is bad by neil gaiman's standards, i'm saying this is bad by all standards. i didn't know gaiman could be this boring. all this book is is a bunch of characters from past books reminiscing (in the vaguest sense) about who the sandman as an idea really is...or was...or something. no loose-ends are tied up (were there even loose-ends to begin with?), and there's no sense of closure because you don't care about what anyone's saying. a whole book exploring the new sandman and his relationship with the family would have been way better.the art is AMAZING, but it doesn't save the story (not even a visual appearance by batman saves it).only get this if you're an obsessive-compulsive completest who must have every volume in the series."
5,The Sandman ends,"This collection concludes the original run of the Sandman. It is a fitting finish to the series, with enjoyable stories and some remarkable artwork.John Muth's ""Exiles"" is next to last in the book, and is a real treat. Part of its topic, an extreme of loyalty, is quielty touching. The look of this piece, however, is what makes it, ink-drawing in a style inspired by Asian classics. The style is quite unlike the watercolors that Muth has used so well (e.g. in Moonshadow), except in its wonderful expressiveness.The final piece in this book, ""The Tempest"" returns to an earlier story and Shakespeare and concludes it. Charles Vess illustrated this in the manner of which he is master: elegant pen work and muted color.""Wake"" is a satisfying end to the original series. Even after the series' long run, it maintains the highest standards of artwork and storytelling. If you enjoy comics at all, you're sure to enjoy at least parts of this.//wiredweird"
4,Great atmosphere,"I first saw a few clips of this DVD on YouTube, then I decided to purchase it. I have not regretted my purchase. The atmosphere of the church hall in which Starobin delivers the music of Sor and Giuliani is completely apt for this innocent and beautiful music played on an equally beautiful period instrument. My only regrets are (a) that we did not really see any attractive footage of ""historic London"", beyond the pretty country lane outside the church, and (b)that the DVD was not actually a bit longer. David Starobin could have spoken about the pieces and their history a little more, too, but a serious student will find this information through other resources. For the playing and the atmosphere, this professional DVD certainly deserves its 4 stars!"
2,Too detailed about small things,"This wasn't about personal injury, it was about trapping crooked judges. So it's not a trial book. Should have read more reviews before ordering. I only got through it so I could see how it ended, but it was really a waste of my time. Turow has too many stories told by too many characters that do nothing toward the plot of the book but just burn up pages and time. Turow has written some really good books but this isn't one of them."
1,UNREADABLE,"I have read Scott Turrows books before and bought this new one with great anticipation. I was so bored to death with it, I cant describe how bad it was. Truly awful. I gave up half way through.Dont bother to buy this."
5,another winner from the best legal writer out there,beyond fabulous -great characters - Turow at his best - p. 375 should be reread once a year
1,It took a tremendous effort to finish the book........,Having not read any of Turow's other books I had heard he was compared to other attorney-turned-authors. He is not anywhere close to any of them - he has way too many characters - way too much meaningless dialog and just boring. Will not buy any other book written by him - unless I really am having trouble going to sleep.
2,Tough to get into and even tougher to finish,"I have read all of Turow's books but found this one real tough to get into. It was extremely tedious, in my opinion, and there were no characters that were particularly likeable. Bottom line is the book drug on. Action picked up in the last 100 pages or so but it was not enough to carry the book."
4,Personal Injuries,This was not written in his usual style. I liked reading it because it was not the usual court room tale.
3,Good for Grisham. Weak for Turow.,"For the first three hundred pages PERSONAL INJURIES is a typically exciting Turow novel. His books are all well written, intriguing, and have ethical and legal dimensions. However, the last hundred pages of this book read as if someone put a gun to the author's end and demanded that he allow an amateur to complete the story. Robbie is an interesting character, but who else in this story turns out to be anything more than a stick figure.Also, in previous books Turow uses characters from his other novels as central or peripheral figures. In these past cases one need not remember the nuances of the character's personality to understand the person in the novel presently being read. In PERSONAL INJURIES, however, one is better off having remembered the Sennet from BURDEN OF PROOF to understand the motivation of this character.This is still a relatively good read. His other books are so outstanding that almost anything else may be disappointing in comparison."
1,Turow's worst effort. Not worth reading.,Turow tells a very boring story of a very unexciting and uninteresting topic. Very poor effort.
1,DEAD ON ARRIVAL,"I don't know what book the other reviewers read but to say that the book was fast paced and had an exciting plot surely wasn't the book I read. It was booooring! I got the book from the library for two weeks and had to turn it in when the book was due and hadn't read half of it. There was no suspense, boring characters, no surprises. I read a lot of books but thriller is certainly not a label I would put on this one."
1,Gift Purchase,"I had to get this particular toy as a gift, so I had to pay what I thought was a very unreasonably high price. The gift was as represented."
3,War...again,"I would have preferred to see more of Rani Mukherji and less of Sanjay Dutt in this one. If I were Indian perhaps I would have liked the film more as a result of patriotic attachment, but even though the film had a few exciting ""action"" scenes, most were predictable(if not inevitable). The strength of the film was in the interpersonal relationships, both between the soldiers themselves, and between the soldiers and their families. Like many Indian films, the tendency was toward representation rather than reality. I was disappointed."
5,"Ridgemont High is in San Diego, NOT Redondo","Crowe's book captures the essence of public high school life in the early 80's; Crowe's point of view is unlike any other you will see, for he graduated from a Catholic High School (University High School, San Diego) two years early at age 16 in order to tour with Led Zeppelin and friends. He then came home, missing his life in San Diego, where he had lived almost his entire life, and decided to pick Ridgemont (Clairemont High School, San Diego--NOT REDONDO in Los Angeles) because that was the school he and his Catholic friends had always dreamed about attending. That is his story in a nutshell, and he still remains very supportive to our beautiful city, as his mother still lives in San Diego to this day."
3,"I liked it, but...","The book is hot, steamy, and erotic without question. The descriptions in this book are intense enough to make an Eskimo sweat. The book takes place in Miami, Fl. which I appreciate, being a native. My one major concern with this book is how modern the vernacular is. Although, coupled to the descriptive nature of the settings and characters the vernacular manages to further depict each character vividly and build the readers mental image of them. My testimony being that I read through the first three chapters of this book in twenty minutes and didn't miss an ioda. Very discriptive and intense. I look forward to my experience to come in this class. I may have forgotten to mention that Mr. Allen is my English Proffesor."
1,Flimsy,"On my first use I realized how low the power is. It bogs down slicing cheese. Many parts that should be metal are made of plastic, including a screw holding the blade and a drive gear delivering power to the blade. No wonder people have complained about these parts breaking. Additionally, cleanup is unnecessarily complex because of the design, making it hardly worth ever using. And because of that design, removing the blade exposes lubricant on the flip side of the cutting blade that surely must be replaced constantly because of that.I've made a very poor choice and should have read the negative reviews and not gone just on the cumulative rating.I'm tossing it out."
2,Not Good,"I've had this slicer for 2 years (I did not get it via Amazon) - today was its last day. It really doesn't work very well - it bogs down, it slices unevenly and it's a bear to clean. I gave it 2 stars because at least it did ""work"" sort of. Really not worth the time or money. Invest in a good electric knife, or a good slicing knife and learn to use it. My only joy with this thing was putting in the trash after using it - so I didn't have to clean it this time!"
4,Slices are consistent.,"This meat slicer is certainly the go to machine in my kitchen. With such a busy household and a limited income, it offers me the option of making my own cold cuts. Did five pounds of roast beef last week and had lunches for the entire week. The only problem I had with it is that the meat doesn't always press against the blade and sometimes the slice isn't even. A minor thing at worst. Otherwise, I don't think I could have a productive kitchen without it."
4,Great home use,Bought this slicer to suffice until I found a better replacement for my German model. I am in no hurry now. This thing gets the job done. It's relatively easy to clean (they are all a pain) definitely more so than my last one. Dollar to value I humbly submit tis the best buy. I liked the design even better than the higher priced models which I was prepared to pay. The only reason it got 4 out of 5 stars is that the center lock is flimsy plastic and although mine hasn't broke I can see the future. My last model did have a better center blade lock about the size of a 50 cent piece with thumb grooves and made of hard plastic. Probably easy to improvise a replacement but I am being extra cautious with it.
5,Amazing!!! Best Beef Jerky Making Equipement Ever,"I am completely satisfied, way way way beyond my best expectations.I've been making Beef Jerky now for almost a year, and the most time consuming task and the most difficult was cutting London Broils into thin uniform strips. Well no more, I just finished slicing about 4 lbs of frozen solid meat in about 10 minutes. I was playing with the cutting thickness and some I had sliced are almost paper thin. I can about see thru those slices of meat. The blade turns slowly and powerfully. Never did the motor sound strained or varied in speed as it sliced all to perfection.And best is that clean up is a breeze. A few turns with a quarter and the blade comes off simply and then exposing all else for wiping.This is an entry level slicer that is going to be a workhorse for a long long time as the quality is very high.Stop your searching -- this is the one!"
2,Not very good,Nice look; poor function. We did not get very good results while cutting fairly difficult meat.
4,Chef's choice slicer,Have small sandwich shop and this slicer for the money is hard to beat. I've had no trouble with it at all. I would recomend it for home use or light commercial use.
5,"Fantastic, but make sure you use the right blade!!","I absolutely love this slicer. I make my own bread, and originally used it to slice that...the serrated blade it comes with works wonders on bread. It will also cut meats, but not nearly as nicely as the optional non-serrated blade. I find it easy to clean and maintain. For the money it is a great slicer. Of course, as with anything, it takes some practice to learn how to 'guide' the bread/meat from the slicer so it doesn't get stuck, but this is common with any slicer, inexpensive or not."
1,Not Premium Slicer,"i purchase That product thinking that it's made with stainless steel, but this item have many parts of plastic, not durability and quality for named ""Premium"". I'm very dissapoint about that food slicer. in not plated, is gray!"
5,We are happy with this purchase!,Very easy to use and very easy to clean. Exactly what we were looking for in a home slicer.
4,very happy,"Great value. The glide is smooth and effortless, the slight lean toward the blade is usefull but too bad they didn't do it all the way. Disassembles easily for cleaning. Very happy overall."
4,Food slicer for home use,"It's a good little food slicer for home use. It's powerful enough to slice beef brisket and slightly frozen raw meats. The slices come off pretty easily. I have not tried it on cheese yet. For around $100, I think I got my money's worth"
2,Waste of Money,"My first Tungsten froze up and would not reset after soft, hard, and cradle resets. After a $25 fee for phone support, waived because of warranty, I sent it back. Two weeks later a refurbished unit arrives. The screen is obviously damaged as it is dim and changes color and brightness when the case, which is loose, is pressed. There was no shipping damage, so I presume it left the plant this way. Technical support says it might be interference with third party software although it has not been hotsynched and no software loaded. Tech support does not answer the phone even for the $25 fee. My experience supports those who have had trouble with the poor quality control and tech support at Palm since the merger with Handspring.Obviously, I would not buy another Palm PDA."
2,Good until it broke two weeks after warranty was up,"I am in medical school and used my palm tx multiple times a day. It was great during boring lectures when WiFi was available to go on the net and to have epocrates to look up drug info and dosing. However, the USB cable for updating it was broken out of the box because the fit was loose when connecting to the palm. And then the charger wouldn't make a connection anymore so it's dead. This is a cheap product that is really expensive. You are better off with an iphone or blackberry."
1,Tech support,I called to on 9-15-08 9:45 est Tech support and i was routed to India. The rep gave me hard time to assist me with the palm tx. I purchased the Palm less than 30 days ago. The Palm was not turning on and the tech requested to fax her a copy of my receipt. I will not recommend to anyone to buy any Palm products as long as the tech support is routed outside the USA.
1,Huge Disappointment,"The Palm TX is not compatible with Windows XP Media and when I upgrade to Vista? Forget it. Seems like all I can do is use the calendar function, essentially. The 'flip cover' is ridiculous. What was I thinking? I miss my IPAQ! That came with a sturdy case, a charger/sync cradle and lots of extra applications. It also came w/an SD card. I'll keep messing with the TX to try to get some wireless connectivity but it doesn't look promising. Anyone have any ideas? Looks like this gift will be headed for resale and I'll go back to an IPAQ!"
4,Nice product,"Got the Palm TX for my birthday and love it. Very helpful doing all the standard stuff Palm Pilots do - organize contacts, etc. The online ability is awesome."
2,ok but questionable expansion w/SD,"The TX works well in all respects except SD cards. After using a Dane 1 gig card for a few days the Palm would no longer recognize the card. Nor would my PC. Apparently the TX fried the card.Doing a Google, this is a common problem. The way I look at it, add $75 bucks to the price of the TX for the fried SD card.Bottom line, don't assume you have additional memory using the SD card slot."
1,Not Worth the Price,"I bought the Palm TX for my wife for christmas, in November of 2006, she has had the unit for a little over year. The unit at first worked terrific but after a few months she started having trouble with the ON switch sticking when she tried to turn it on, the unit was not mistreated or damaged in any way. Recently when trying to HotSync the TX the unit quit working all together. We tried charging the unit over night to see if the battery was drained which could have caused the unit to stop working, to no avail the unit is still dead. Although this product has the great name of PALM, the unit itself is not worth the price you pay for the it when the shelf life is less than a year. Palm's customer service for repairs is $129.95+ which is almost half of the original price of the Palm TX. I would not recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a Handheld. Should you unfortunately happen to purchase this product, PLEASE get the extended warranty."
5,Best PDA for the price.,"I have owned a few Palm products in the past. The Palm IIIxe, Tungsten and the Tungsten T2. With the TX I feel like I own a machine that does it all. It has all the speed and memory I need and will even link with my Motorola cell phone for phone calls. The best part is being able to sit in the living room, airport or Starbucks and receive and send email with the on board wifi. It also has a battery lifespan that is far superior to the other Palms I own. It's a great product, easy to use, at a great price (only at Amazon.com) and I recommend it to everyone. The only recommendations I have is that you buy a cradle for synchronization/charging and a cover that is fancier than the drab cover provided."
4,just bought one and looks pretty good,"My unit arrived in a brown shipping box with a software installation CD and a 60 day refund or exchange warranty. Since it doesn't have the silver/gray box that usually contains the new palm unit and it also has shorter warranty than other stores would provide, I was a little worried that it is not a brand new unit or it is not from a legitimate source. But, it doesn't look like a used one, and it works fine."
5,Palm TX Works,"After having lost my faithful Sony pda to water damage (lesson: stay away from pools unless you're there to swim), I did a lot of research to find a replacement on a budget. I chose the Palm TX based on my desire for a handheld computer, on various professional and private reviews, and finally, on price. The used TX that I purchased has worked out fine -- living up to its reviews. Yes, as they say, the battery life is fair to poor. I find that it's consumed most rapidly by being on the internet; other typical uses do not deplete it too badly at all. Overall I'm very pleased with it and would recommend it to others."
1,Not a reliable product,I bought the Palm TX because my Tungston wouldn't hold a charge any longer. I have been a long time user of Palm ad thought that the TX might have some good features. My first Palm TX wouldn't turn on even after recharging it several times and soft and hard re-setting it. A two hour wait for Palm tech support (when the voice said only a five minute wait) didn't help my mood much. Tech support told me what I already knew--the product was defective. I returned it to Amazon and asked for a replacement hoping to have a different experience. This time the Palm charged but after it charged the screen went blank. Again tech support gave the same advice--which I already knew and finally told me to just charge it for 24 more hours (of course I knew that wouldn't make much difference) so now after another 24 hour charge I am returning the TX to Amazon and asking for a refund. I think I am finally finished with Palm after reading all of the negative reviews for their products.
4,PDA FOR NURSING,"This is a great asset in nursing, you have needed information right at the bedside. Considering my patients I prefer to use this for work only instead of a blackberry phone. I have loaded my TX with Nursing software but for some reason my TX keeps shutting down especially when I click on Office documents. I had to restart it several times from the reset button. Other than that it's a great working tool for me and works great with my MAC."
3,It was great for a while,"My Palm TX died tonight, for the last time. I've struggled with it for almost 2 years, through several expensive repairs and parts replacements, but it looks finished. I was a faithful Palm customer for 10 years, and really believed in their product, but evidently Palm did not. The much reported problems with screen calibration and the power button beset my Palm as well. It was a great design, with great software, but Palm appears to be have managed quality control very very poorly. It will make me very very reluctant to try their new product."
1,Palm TX Digitizer Problems after several months use.,"This was my fourth Palm. I love them and use them daily. However my last palm, a TX only lasted about 13 months when the digitizer failed on it. I called Palm and after telling them the digitizer failure is a known issue and to check out the internet forums that I had found hundreds of failed TX owners and requested they replace my digitizer under warranty. The best they would do was to knock off 50% of the repair cost. I told them they had lost a customer for good! I would not recommend the TX as it (the digitizer) will fail after about a year of use."
4,Great PDA but manuals but hardcopy manuals are missing,The Palm TX has all the features as advertised. Great unit.Cons: USB cable and power connection are a bit obtuse. It would be better to have a cradle. Manuals are only on PDF (download). Maybe I missed a turn somewhere on the manuals but my conclusion is that no manual is formatted for the Palm itself!
1,Horrible! Make sure to check your phone compatibility!!!!,"I am stuck with this Palm TX. I bought it to link with my phone so that I would have internet on my PDA...didn't want to have a big phone that was a PDA. I have tried to hook up with the internet via my LG CU500 but Palm doesn't have any drivers for my phone. I had no idea that I needed to check with their website before purchasing to find out if I had a compatible phone.The PDA part works fine but if I wanted ""just"" a PDA I would have bought something less expensive! I am totally unhappy with this. I spoke with Palm and asked if that meant that I was ""stuck"" with this. The reply was yes. I will never buy their products again!"
5,PDA's almost obsolete - Palm TX handheld,PDA's are almost non-existent. Even though I have an iphone I still wanted a PDA to use. It helps me keep up with business info. I was happy to be able to get this refurbished Palm PDA. Soon they won't be around any longer. The delivery was fast.KY
1,FRUSTRATED!!!!,"I bought my Palm T|X less than a year ago to replace my Sony Clie that I had left on the airplane. At first I was very pleased with my Palm, now it is all I can do to keep from chucking it in the trash. The Stylus will not calibrate. No matter how precise I try to calibrate the pen, I still have a problem activtivating the control I point to. I had my Clie for several years and never had this problem. Unfortunately, Sony discontinued the Clie. If you can't use the pointer on the Palm, the whole palm is pretty much useless! I have tryed calibration several times, soft reset, hard reset, software restore, nothing works. My stylus will not calibrate. Now I cannot not reach the menu items at the bottom of the screen because the calibration for the sylus is way below the screen. I called tech support (located in India) twice and they hung up on me twice before I could even state the problem. I now am the proud owner of a Palm paper weight!!!"
3,"Almost, but not quite.","First, when will Palm learn that Mac users would like a compatible PDA? Instead of chasing us, Palm decides to all but shun the Mac crowd in the hopes that they can compete with Windows mobile devices. Sigh...That said, the TX is a pretty cool machine, although the first one I got developed touch screen issues within three days. The replacement has developed similar problems but not as severe as the first (Amazon was great about replacement). The Wifi is a cool feature but I haven't been able to find a decent web browser (tried Opera Mini but the separately required Java app seemed to make the whole machine wiggy). For video, the playback is surprising. For photos, however, the color seems dark and bland.If you do buy one and you are a Mac owner, I strongly suggest the Missing Sync by Mark/Space."
3,TX leaves something to be desired,"Palm's TX product should be a great product but it has some problems that will prevent it from being so. Most nagging are: 1) accessing some applications cause the unit to unexpectedly reset, 2) some applications can not be downloaded to the device (via WIFI or USB), and 3) the unit mysteriously turns itself on while plugged into the charger and USB (I have not noticed this when on batteries alone; and I don't know if it turns itself off).On the plus side, the ability to create and/or edit Excel and Word documents is fantastic and very useful and will impress anyone to whom you demonstrate it. The rotating display is very helpful and useful as well. The disappearing keyboard is great and makes for a greater viewing area. The WIFI has worked as advertized at my home location. However, on the raod, I have experienced acess problems but I expect these problems were setup/operator issues."
4,Review of Palm TX replacing a Tungsten E,"I ordered the TX as my Palm Tungsten E (TE) began its final death spiral after about 4 or 5 years. I thought the extras (bigger screen, WiFi, additional memory, speed) might be useful, and the TX cost me not much more than the TE when I got it. Fortunately, all the registered software and data was easily transfered in the initial hotsynch and re-installation where necessary, and the transition was smooth (HINT: save all registration keys). WiFi works, but not as smoothly as I might like. Otherwise, I like the TX. Battery life seems better than the TE, and the bigger screen is a real plus.It's too soon to assess durability or reliability; time will tell.Depending on how I am carrying the TX,I use either the Palm-supplied screen flap or a Krusell case; I really like the Krusell case (also available through Amazon)."
2,Palm fails software 101--again,"Based on a long history with Palm (back to 1996 and the original Palm) and good reviews for the TX both here and on CNET, I purchased the TX. Four times I tried to install the software, four times it failed. The culprit is a little subroutine called VMDialogWrapper.exe. I looked on Google, and found 3 references to this problem, and tried the solution mentioned there, a neat little program put out by Microsoft called Windows Installer Cleanup. Even that did not help. I know from previoius experience with Palm that they will not service what they sell, except with gobs of money, so I am reluctantly returning this unit. It looks like a great design, has the WiFi and Bluetooth I wanted, etc. Were it not for the lousy little subroutine, I would happily rate this either 4 or 5 stars, but if it's DOA, then the rating has to be lower. I hope others have more success, but for me, I'm moving to Windows Mobile."
1,An open boxed item(or USED) sale as new item,"I bought it because it said it is a new item. But when I got it, it is not in original package and the fliping screen guard already installed!!If they said it in anywhere on their product page about open boxed item (or used) then I will not pay the new item price!!!Circuit City is on sale this week $299-$70MIR-$40($40 off $199coupon)Which surely is NEW."
4,Palm TX a step forward - Docking Cradle a step backward,"I recently upgraded from my Palm V to the TX. I love the new TX... bright large display, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. However, my docking cradle kit arrived today and it is a disappointment. Why go forward with a product and backward with the peripherals. The lightweight dock wobbles and slides back when trying to enter information when it is in the cradle and instead of one cable running to the unit, there are two (three if you include the audio jack). More mess on the desk! The travel kit is larger and bulkier than the Palm V model. I love the TX but wish it would fit my old Palm V docking station and travel kit. Hey Palm people, here is an idea for your next releaase... make the docking station larger and heavier and the travel kit smaller and lighter."
4,decent replacement for palm tungsen e,capable replacement. battery life has greatly improved. no real complaints. wifi works fine.
3,Software and learning curve,"I think the TX it's self is an excellent piece of hardware.I have had no problems with it in the one month that i have owned it.My computer skills are about average i think; meaning push the mouse button to get the software then push the mouse button to install it then it does it's thing for you.I bought this device to listen to talk radio pod casts,bible studies and Rss feeds.I have spent most of the time finding software for each operation,down loading pieces of it also compiling some ,etc. I did get the bible software installed and will tackle the rest one bite at a time.I am still happy with my new toy though and would buy it again."
5,Best palm,Much better than being scared by Win Mobile frozen screens. Good variety of apps. Nice buy.
3,Good Upgrade,Much better than zire. Screen is nice and big. I was able to upload data from old 550 directly through IR beam. Have not used most of the new features yet. Charger set up and connectors are better than before.
2,Display Problems,"About three weeks after activating, the device exhibited display problems: the screen would go gray and be unviewable. Tried various resets,including a hard reset but problem persisted. Now returning it to seller for a new one. I've got my fingers crossed!"
2,"It is not NEW as advertised , but refurbished","I found out after providing the serial number to customer support that this IS NOT a new Palm as advertised, and therefore it is not covered by the warranty. Palm will charge me $25 for technical support per call because it is a refurbished model. I could have saved over $70 if I had wanted to get a refurbished one! I am VERY disappointed that Amazon misrepresented this product."
3,"great product, terrible installation","This is my third Palm product. I was upgrading from a Palm Tungsten E to the Palm T/X. I followed the instructions from the Palm database to make sure that I would not loose any of my data. The installation disc that came with the product would not install the required information on either my office Windows 2000 nor my home Windows XP service pack 2. I contacted customer support via email and they were useless. Following all their prompts did nothing. After removing and re-installing the product numerous times, with the suggested patches from Palm, I was finally able to install the required software. The Palm T/X itself is great. I love the way it handles the applications. One exception would be Bluetooth. While the Palm literature brags about the Bluetooth capability, it is not until the very fine print footnotes that you find that it is not compatible with Verizon cell phones. They should be more upfront with that."
1,"I like it but for one fatal flaw, buyer beware!","There is a lot to like about the Palm TX: light, small, reasonably fast, lots of available accessories, and simple interface. There is a lot to dislike too, but my main problem is that Palm DOES NOT support Media Center Edition of Windows XP. If you use Media Center Edition, you will NOT be able to sync your TX with Outlook and your syncs to Palm Desktop WILL be unreliable. What's personally infuriating is the amount of time it took for me to find this out. It took me a long time and many hours of troubleshooting - via suggestions from the Palm Website - to realize the incompatibility. I only found out when I called Palm Tech support (toll call too!). Palm should be upfront that this will not work with MCE. Be sure that the operating system you use is compatible before you buy!* I tried to e-mail Palm several times since the phone call that figured out this problem. No response. Get used to that if you have problems with your hardware or software!"
4,"Great features for price, not sure about stability","I was pleased overall with the T|X - WiFi and Bluetooth both worked wonderfully, speed was good, form-factor was thin and unit is light, display is beautiful, all the traditional Palm OS apps work as they always have - the only area of concern for me is stability.I put an MMC card in the slot and since it had some PC data on it, I tried to format it in the Palm. The format failed part-way through and the unit hung. Rebooting the Palm, it would return to the main app screen, the hang again. I had to remove the MMC card which was now fried - meaning it was unusable in the Palm, the PC, and my camera - and I had to send the card back to the manufacturer for replacement. I then used a 1gb SD card I had and it worked just fine (though I didn't format it in the Palm). It rebooted one other time when I didn't ""tell"" it to If it wasn't for this question of stability, I could give it 5 stars, so 4 will have to do."
2,A word of advise.,"This is my 4th palm device and this is the first time that I have ever had trouble with a Palm. The desktop software is buggy. On two computers, the software crashes. It appears that Palm did not do their homework for a user that is upgrading.At times the device will do a reboot when I go to check my e-mail.A software glich causes the device to not see it's expanson card, and only a hard reset will cure it; for a while.Palm tech support was worthless. First attempt, they told me to return my first TX because the expansion card slot was defective. Second Palm did the same thing, but I discovered the Hard Reset fix. E-mail tech support & you will receive a form response to reload all software & no e-address to respond to. They will send you a survey. :-)This unit may have been rushed to quickly into production. My advise would be to wait till they get all the bugs out.My gmail address is enihill if you want to compare notes."
3,Palm TX Handheld,"Reliable and easy to use as always, but returned it for an HP iPaq 2495 for one reason - compatibility with MS Outlook. Palm claims compatibility, but nothing works as well synchonizing, etc., as the HP. When synchronizing with the Palm and 2 PC's, all data duplicates itself, so you end up with multiples copies of the same file.Palm's nice w/great features, and I don't think the HP's are built to be as reliable, but it's the true Outlook compatibility that made the decision for me."
5,"Yes, yes, yes","My friend liked Heather Nova; I even had the artist sign a copy of one of her album's and sent off to them. But I never owned a Heather Nova of my own until South. I bought out of nostalgie for days gone by, but I listen to it for its own merits. Truly remarkable, truly listenable, truly enjoyable. Some songs just tickle your mind. And some albums managed to do as well. This is one of them. It grows on you with out boring you. Not bad.My daugther's favorite song is Virus of the Mind. She is three and so I bet it is the 'tutu do tu' at the beginning that tickles her mind."
2,Not quite the otherwordly one here...,"Four years in the making and a few release date push backs later and HEATHER NOVA's 'South' has finally arrived. Sadly though, it doesn't come close to living up to any of her past releases. She sounds too produced here, and she doesn't need to be. Her unique and otherworldly voice is either restrained in places or placed in settings far too unfamiliar. 'South' isn't without its moments, though. 'Welcome', which was co-written by Dido, is a terrific way to lead off the album. It's a chugging rocker with a memorable chorus. There are other songs on the album that sound like typical Heather songs, but, there's too much genre shifting and no real direction, and that's just a total waste of Heather Nova's immense talents."
4,"This was not as impressive as her first two albums, but good...","I really enjoyed Heather Nova's first two albums, but was disappointed with this release. It's definately still true Heather and has good lyrics and songs, but it did not feel as fresh or as memorable to me. I would recommend buying the first two before this one."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This 'Valet' is so flimsy and weak that it is a total waste of money. It fell apart the very first week. However, it did burn well in the fireplace."
3,Penn-Elcom Butterfly Latch,"Unfortunately these latches don't hold up as well as I was hoping. They make a nice latch, but you can't put much pressure on them."
5,Brilliant -direct information with the perfect amount of humor,"Dr. Laughlin has successfully organized what I **really** wanted to learn in Sunday School but didn't. Many moons ago, I was a student of Dr. Laughlin. At that time, his insightful and humorous manner helped guide me to tear down and rebuild my personal faith. This book consolidates what I learned during those years. I have since shared this with friends and recently passed it on to my 18 year old son when he came to me with questions regarding discrepancies in the creation story. A great read for both the layperson and scholar."
1,Food Poisoning,This item actually gave our dogs food poisoning. We took them both to the vet after feeding them these treats for only three days and the DR said they had contracted food poisoning. This was the ONLY item that they had eaten that was new to their diet and the vet agreed that it would be these treats that caused it.
2,Dog Didn't Eat Them,"I bought these on a lightnining deal and from an objective standpoint, each box is well packaged with a good amount of treats. I have a 9 year old Havanese and she won't eat this. She ate them the first two times I gave them to her and then she just started to play with them without eating them. Oh well."
4,One stale box,"My dog loves these treats and I love that they don't have the carcinogenic sodium nitrate that all the other dog treats have. Just one complaint. In the last batch of six boxes we received, one box came with completely hard and stale treats even though the bag was still sealed. Hope that does not happen again."
4,cell phone accessories,"Chargers and phone holster very functional and at a very reasonable price. Would have prefered a rubberized version of the belt clip holster for the LG CU400, for added durability."
5,Great shoes if you stand all day,"I work in a school where I am on my feet all day, and these shoes are wonderful! When I first got them, the leather was a little stiff and rubbed the top of my feet, but after they got more worn in, they are perfect. They are also very resistant to a variety of liquids and look great even after many, many miles on them."
5,"TALENT, TALENT, TALENT","Whether it is Oprah Winfrey, Alligator Commentator or Lorena Bobbitt, Penile Amputator, Noel Miller gives the reader much more value than the minimal cost of this amusing book. This publication will amuse your friends, family, and dinner party guests for years to come. It is a classic! I am sure that the author's work will far surpass the fame of the Blue Dog. Louisiana should be proud of this great combination of art and poetry"
1,SUMO HARDENS IN ITS BOTTLE,I HAVE HAD TWO BOTTLES OF SUMO AND HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO USE AROUND A QUARTER OF EACH AS IT DRIES /HARDENS IN ITS CONTAINER IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. CALLED THE mANUFACTURER AND THEY SAID THEY INFORM RETAILERS TO REMOVE OLD STOCK BY DATE CODE OR CUSTOMERS MY GET A BOTTLE THAT IS NEAR ITS EXPIREATION DATE. BEWARE AS THIS COMPANY DOES NOT CARE.
3,THIS EDITION IS OBSOLETE,"The third edition, which is many pages longer and costs $ 24.00, is a betterbuy. Many new photos, excellent diagrams and a full collection, in color, ofAnti-Aircraft insignia gets you more for your money."
2,Not worth it,"I love GOLDWEL but, at this price this product is a total miss. The hair product did not do anything it promised so ladies and gentlemen save your cash."
2,Poor workmanship,"This puller accomplished the task (pulling a crankshaft pulley). It is a poor quality tool though. It is certainly not designed to last a lifetime. The treads do not run smooth, and the metal feels weak. I would not have been surprised if it would have stripped the threads on the first run."
2,Doesn't last,Works great while the controller lasted. I bought two and the first one died after a couple of months then the second controller died a few months later.
1,Horrible switch! Save your money and go with another brand.,"We purchased 15 of these switches. What they don't tell you is 3Com charges for updated firmware by requiring a pricey service contract. These switches also loose their config's very easily when adding/removing a switch from the stack and not everything is saved in their config when a power reset happens!! The stacking feature is a joke, it takes about 5-10 mins for the switch to begin normal operation after powering it up in a stack. They also have about 7 fans in the switch, which nearly all of the switches we originally bought had to be returned because of a fan eventually dying and the switch faulting.I was a huge fan of 3Com with their SuperStack II switches and those stacking features back in the day but these new ones are a complete joke and they must have skipped quality inspections since they downsized their company."
3,"Slightly above average from other Demille novels, 3 and a half stars","An interesting premise and enjoyable book. My main complaint, and although I like the sarcasm and one liners, the deluge of wisecracks by Corey, in my opinion became tiresome and diminished the read."
5,John Corey is as good and cynical as ever!,"Nelson DeMille has done it again. With the return of John Corey, and his wife Kate, they are investigating the Custer Hill Club.An extremely funny, and also thought-provoking novel, it explores the questions of what could, or would happen if a nuclear attack ever occured on U.S. soil. I won't ruin the plot for anyone, but needless to say, it could be scary.I don't think that this novel is as good as Nightfall, or the Lion's Game, it's still is good enough to recieve a 5-star rating from me."
3,Not Demille-Worthy,"Much like his previous novel, Night Fall, Demille's latest effort is both completely readable and completely unremarkable. The first 100 pages or so are quite interesting as the bad guys detail their devious plan to change the world. The problem is that the rest of the book (the next 400 pages) are spent showing us how the main characters, Corey and Mayfield, put the pieces together to ultimately foil the plan. This is problematic because the reader already knows what is going to happen and therefore the suspense is almost non-existent. Once you factor in that the ending is going to be a happy one, there isn't much for the reader to look forward to. Fortunately, Demille is still a great writer and his hero, John Corey, is as humurous as ever. I just wish he had chosen to tell his story in a way that allowed the reader to be more involved."
1,"Jingoism, pure and simple","I read this novel until the end of Chapter 4 and then quit.I realized that the author actually promotes (in the foreword)that the MAD(mutually assured destruction) doctrine be used in the following way:If any American city is nuked by unknown terrorists, then the US should nuke all Muslim cities.Jingoism pure and simple.Psychotic politics under the guise of fiction,andthe plot is sleepily slow."
2,I won't give away the ending (but Mr. DeMille does),"Very early on in the story, DeMille deflates all mystery and suspense from the novel by having the Head Bad Guy tell us what's going to happen. He does this by departing from the 1st person narrative of John Corey to a 3rd person omniscient perspective. I simply cannot understand why he took this approach.I'm not sure how much it would have helped the book had DeMille done otherwise. As other reviewers have pointed out, Detective Corey's nonstop rejoinders go from tiresome to irksome. At countless points in the book Corey will make a wisecrack and the next line reads something like 'Kate ignored that and said...' Well, after a while the READER starts to ignore these useless remarks from the main character. And that's not a good thing!"
2,"stupid premise, obnoxious corey","I was really disappointed with this one -- I had enjoyed a couple Corey novels in the past, but I had to put this one down after about 30 pages. The premise seemed so stupid, and none of the protagonists pointed out some of the obvious problems with the evil plot. And Corey was just a crass, crude buffoon in this one -- I don't remember him being so tiresome in Demille's other novels. It was unreadable. Won't read another Corey novel."
4,Wild Fire,"Another great Corey story. It takes a long time to develop - seems like it could have been 50 pages shorter, but always has the edgy, wise-cracking, anti hero at his best. I love the ending, what a way to finish. When does the Corey movie series start?"
1,Wild Fire,"It's been a disappointing read. For someone who wrote Gold Coast and The General's Daughter, this book is a cheap knock-off of really good suspense formula novels. I have not written one of these reviews before, but wanted to take the time because I felt that Nelson DeMille is so much better than this third class effort, and, actually, if I could, I would ask for my money back. Although the basic story line is believable, the behavior of the characters is childish, contrived and highly unlikely. Usually buy DeMille's work immediately when it comes out. Will think twice before I waste my money and time again."
2,A Little Better,"Wild Fire is an improvement over Night Fall, but DeMille has a long way to go before he matches The Charm School. Wild Fire is fast-paced. The plot is intriguing, but far-fetched. However, John Corey's incessant flip and insulting remarks are a huge detriment and bring the entire book down to 2 stars. He deserves immediate retirement."
2,Wildfire - a little smoke and fire.,"Wildfire is my first Nelson DeMille and it would probably be my last, but I'm on an island and I only have one other book in English - by Nelson DeMille. I read a lot and generally of this genera. DeMille took 706 pages to tell a story what should have been 300-400 pages. The book is weighted down and burdened with excessively cutesy dialogue by the main character. The only suspense is the waiting for something to actually happen and nothing happens of exciting consequence until about 680 or so pages. If you like wise-ass dialogue, intricate, unbelievable plots, and the unbearable suspense of waiting for something to actually happen - this book might be for you. I'll stick to Randy Wayne White, Douglas Preston, Lee Child - writers who write at least as well as DeMille, but who can actually tell a well paced story where things actually happen."
3,Wild Fier,Fun read interesting plot. It's a page tuner. If you are a fan of DeMille's other John Cory novels you will like this one. I read it in about a day and a half while on vacation.
3,A travelog not a novel,"Characters were overshawdowed by the geography and political background. Most of what is in here you can read in the news. If you are looking for entertainment, this only delivers in the last 75 pages."
4,DeMille's latest,"Somewhat typical DeMille with a terrorist plot that puts the world in danger. As always, John Cory is the adept detective while his usual amusing self."
5,Great book !!!,Im glad I bought it . It a great book to read with all family . Our black to read this book to know their history
4,A return to the days of activist music!,"I'm glad to see musicians making political music again (not that they ever stopped, but it's making a resurgence now). First the artists start protesting and then the population at large does. To the reviewer who says ""the people voted for [Bush]"": Uh, no, they didn't. The man didn't win the popular election. Unless by ""people"" you mean the Supreme Court. This is one of the reasons why people are mad enough to finally do something about it, like put out CDs and donate the proceeds! You get a lot of music for $8, too. Some of the bands I'd never heard of but most of them I have. It's not like some compilations with nothing but garage bands. Give it a try."
1,Some of the worst music I have ever heard,"These are some of the crapiest collaboration of artists (if you want to call them that) that I have ever seen. These bands have no talent what so ever. These are the ""punk"" bands of America. This kind of music isn't even punk its crappy pop to make American teens hate the current presidency. I can't believe that this is the best you people could come up with to ""rock against Bush."""
2,"Music is mediocre at best; politics, on the other hand.","The music is ok... some real big bands on here, but the song selection was done by a 5 year old. These must be their worst songs. I didn't find any that I liked.As for the politics, stuff it. I don't pay musicians to hear their opinions; I pay to hear their music (well, if I pay, I pay to hear their music). Otherwise, keep the politics to yourself.I still don't understand the title, and I think this liberal brain-washing of our youth is the lowest blow they could pull out of their tragic bag of tricks. The music sucks, the message sucks, but it gets an extra star because the bands are good, even though their tracks on this cd do them no justice."
1,i dont support bush and i like a few of these bands but....,"im glad that bush won the election to make this ""trend"" of hating conservatives go the heck away.....if you want a good new punk cd...get ""divided we stand"" by tsol."
1,DOMOCRATS SUCK!!!!!!,i hate it when people bash our awesome president Bush is the man!!! john kerry was a pansy so are all democrats and they are liers and theifs and tradors to our own country i can't believe people like you wanna bash our country and our awesome president it just plain sucks
2,Average music/Capitalizes on America's youth,"There are a lot of great bands on here. The problem is, the songs are average at best. The Alkaline Trio song stands out but I think it's the shortest song they have ever made. Everything else on the cd seems to be filler tracks. This release has generated a lot of opinions on the current state of political affairs. No matter how messed up they may be, I disagree with the fact that artists such as these (ie. Fat Mike) feel the need to assert so much of their own ideas on to the very easily influenced youth of this country. I buy cds for the band's music. I don't give a crap who they voted for. Entertain me. That's all. It's good to educate kids who know little or nothing about our government but don't use your status as a rock star to do it. There are other ways."
4,"Great CD, at an even greater price.","Bought this CD for about $10(Canadian) which is a steal, and most of this songs on this CD rock. Good mizture of new and old bands. The Offspring's ""new"" track, 'Baghdad' on this CD is actually a re-recorded and slightly re-worded track from the early 90's called 'Tehran' written during the 1st Gulf war. Scary that it is still relevant today, but still a great song none the less.Funny how all the right-wing Bush nuts are saying people who listen to this CD are ignorant. Being a Canadian, I'm glad this compilation was put together, here's hoping that you guys can vote out Bush in November, and help make the world a better place."
4,chairmen odf the board trying to free their minds go head,"good funky effort back in the 70's everybody was trying to free their minds and since invictus was trying to push envelopes why not have cotb do something edgier but not only that they get the original funkadelic on here to give it that raw rockier edge that everybody from the isley's and sly stone was doing anyhow you like old 70's soul from motown, anmd invictus buy this you hear bernie worrell, and eddie hazel, billy basds nelson and tiki fulwood from the original funkadelic."
1,A Perfect Waste of Time,"What a dumb, empty novel. Neither of the principle characters, Connor McCloud and Erin Riggs, has a single personality trait that's attractive. McCloud is tortured to the point of psychosis, filled with self-pity and uncontrolled lusts. Erin, the object of his obsession, is a compulsive snot who plays on his emotions like a mandolin, is at one moment a totally dedicated business-woman and at the next a sexual wanton. What she sees as attractive in him is merely physical, and creepy physical at that. Otherwise, he's rude, coarse, ill-mannered, and slightly crazy. He wants to dominate her and she wants to manipulate him. You wouldn't want to go to lunch with either of them, even if they were buying."
4,Standing in the Shadows,"This is the second installment to Shannon McKenna's The McCloud Brothers Series and this story is about Ex-FBI agent Connor McCloud and Erin Riggs. I definitely liked this story better than Behind Closed Doors & Out of Control. I have yet to finish the series, but am looking forward to it. This story has all the suspense, romance, thrills, & erotica thrown into one. I loved Connor's character: tough & strong, yet vulnerable. Erin was also a likeable & strong heroine. Their relationship was well developed and believable & together, they burn the sheets with hot, scorching flames! The story moved at a good pace with lots of suspense and twist & turns. I really enjoyed this book & highly recommend it for those who like their romantic suspense with a sprinkle of erotica!"
3,"Warning! Runs Small, Color is Off, and they sit *high*!","I've owned these pants for nearly a year now. All in all, they are a good product, and will last you a while. Note that the material is pretty sturdy - these are *not* 'loose' or 'light' pants. These are the jeans of khakis, if that makes any sense.BUT, be warned that they run rather small. I had to return the first pair I ordered and order another pair with an extra inch in the legs and two extra inches in the waist. I bought Dockers at the same time, and my original order size was spot-on with those.The color is also a bit off. If you are dead set on getting the color shown in the picture, you might want to re-consider.Finally, and this might sound like a weird complaint, but the zipper, doesn't... *ahem*... go down far enough. This can make visiting the restroom somewhat uncomfortable. Just a heads-up."
1,This could be the worst movie I've ever seen.,"I purchased this DVD for my 7-year old daughter. It's Little Red Riding Hood, so how could I miss, right? WRONG!!1. It's a musical - with bad music.2. It's not for little kids (has a level of creepiness & rudeness).3. It's just not tolerable on any level - it's that bad.4. You've been warned.Bill HLeague City, TX"
3,Get it for disk 1,I agree w/ the majority of reviewers that the 2nd cd is horrible. It is definately worth (for a good price) it for the 1st cd alone. The 2nd one is all vocals and should be burnt in the fireplace on your yultide log sipping a cognac.
1,poor,broke after one year from purchasing it and of course the gurantee was over and couldn't fix it.
1,"Impossible,,,,,","The first game was absolutely impossible to beat, the second one will be twice as hard to beat....."
4,5 stars for x-box live multiplayer. 1 star for single player,"The x-box live multiplayer is really what this game is about. Contrary to what a lot of reviewers wrote. There is ALOT of skills in wielding a light sabre. The variety of things you can do in multplayer is incredible, from doing beautiful acrobatic moves, the various light sabre weapons, the different stances, piloting different vehicles, different jedi powers (becoming invisible, shoot lightning, healing, pushing people off cliffs).The single player on the other hand is is very boring. I get stuck a lot, because I don't use this one force power to pull this one lever for example. It's really frustrating, and not that rewarding.4 stars, cause the multiplayer is what I play mostly, and has tons of replay value."
2,"Bad copy, good content","This video paused in the later chapters, I tried different devices to view this DVD (blueray disk player, desktop laptop and it was hard viewing.I coaching a Battlebot team for the first time and what I was able to watch, give the kids a good insight their upcoming matches."
5,great product,"The wheels are a godsend! Very sturdy and easy to assemble. I got 2 of these, one for my 10-yr-old and one for my new puppy, so they can get used to each other. If they get upset, I can just wheel one of them away until they settle down."
1,Please restore and re-release!,"If ever there was a classic movie that begs to be restored to its original grandeur, this is it! Please make a state-of-the-art anamorphic transfer with fresh Dolby Digital sound! This movie deserves it! Look at the beautiful new print of The Sting. That is what is needed."
5,Star Wars Rebel Strike game,"This is a fun game it just starts out slow because you have to go through some tutorials, but from what I notice besides that once you get past that its a lot of fun. Haven't got into it too much but hopefully when I do I will post more on this review."
4,OK for Lucasarts,"Star Wars Rebel Strike is ok. It's graphics are fine, but not great, and it is very short game. There is only 1 out of 9 which i like, and i barely play that. i beat it in a week and 2 days, and I never played it again. The first day I got it I was excited, but now I'm bored. If u like Lucasarts games don't buy this. y?"
1,Weak Force,"I don't often review games, but I had to write in on this one. This game was pretty bad. Soem major plot flaws. Some horrible control (can't control the camera on foot missions) and just plain stupid elelments like ""sonic weapons"" in space. When I came across that, I just turned the game off. Fortunately I rented this because I wasn't sure I like it. I loved Rogue 2 and it's one of my favorite games. I liked the idea of flying some missions with a friend, but the single player version is dumb dumb DUMB.People who like this game probably also like Jar-Jar."
1,Item is not Smarties,"The product arrived and it is not as pictured or described. The Smarties logos visible on the box and the individual necklace packages that are seen in the product picture ARE NOT on the box or packages that I received. It looks identical except for the absence of the Smarties logo. The product itself, needless to say, is not made out of Smarties. A case of bait and switch? Thank you Amazon for refunding my money!"
2,You can't run before you can walk,"Firstly, from my own experiences I am convinced that learning solos before experiencing authentic flamenco first-hand in its land of origin is rather like building a house from the roof down. I started with a Mel Bay book and as my fascination grew I bit the bullet and went to Jerez in Spain and studied with David El Poeta, an actual human teacher, and a good one. In a few weeks I learned a whole gamut of essential techniques and nuances without which playing these solos would have been meaningless.Mr Martin presents some good examples of flamenco playing but they are all based on his deep knowledge of flamenco rhythms and harmonic structures which he acquired by acompanying singers and dancers.So although it's all great stuff, a trip to Southern Spain where you can see flamenco guitar played in its natural context would be a sensible step before buying this book and attempting the solos."
1,was this supposed to be funny?,"This book has an interesting premise but all of the characters are one dimensional. The dialogue is bad but is nothing compared to the inner monologues. At one point the heroine says that there is no way she should find the hero attractive, She says ""You have to be joking"" Of course you know they are bound to be together from page 1 if not earlier. This isn't a good book even for it's genre."
5,"Great CD, can't wait for a follow up","This cd is great and you should buy it, its rock and electronic music fused properly with just a hint of emoness. The best song on the CD is number 6, Clark Gable, people tend to over look this song because the beginning of it is kind of annoying but if you get past that you will really enjoy it, i promise. Maybe the only better song is 4 i'm not sure depends on what you like more. but you gotta buy it. I never heard music like this before"
1,What is this?,My girlfriend listens to it so i downloaded a dozen songs to check it out. I tried over and over to enjoy it but its very monotonous and downright horrifying to listen to.The vocals are sometimes half-sung or just spoken. If it weren't for the cheesy keyboard beats and the half-ass effort vocals I may have more interest.
1,Postal Service goes out of service,"My indie loving friend recommended this album to me. When I complained that there were only two good songs on the CD, she said, ""I know, but I just listen to the whole thing anyway."" Strangely, every other person I know who has the album listens to the whole thing for just two good songs. What is this odd phenomenon? It is the plight of a lousy album that has somehow become popular. Listen to The New Pornographers instead, or Stars. Don't be surprised when indie kids actually listen to the songs and The Postal Service goes out of service."
1,Such Abyssmal Lows,"To be honest I've never heard this record but the radio plays that song ""Such Great HEights"" about once an hour at work and it's the most remarkably annoying song I've ever heard in my life! Good sweet Lord! It sounds like a cross between the pet shop boys and Jimmy Eat World. I've had people tell me that I gotta check out Death CAb For Cutie, but not after having this guy wail nosily in my ear every hour! It sounds like it should be playing in the background of some U.P.N teen drama or something. Pick up a Fall record instead."
3,Not so great,"I got this album about 2 summers ago when it first came out after hearing ""Such Great Heights"" and after having it for a solid 2 years, I can say that this is at best just average. It's not horrible, nor is it excellent, just so-so.It is however very creative and mellow. The overall tone of the album is somewhat ambient with fuzzy little electronics and soft vocals. It's just that some songs just aren't very grabbing, and another thing, the lyrics are a little cheesy in some songs, and the singing is dreadful.Key tracks: ""The District Sleeps Alone Tonight""/""Such Great Heights""/""Sleeping In""/""We Will Become Silhouettes/""This Place is a Prison""/""Brand New Colony""/""Natural Anthem"""
3,"Houston, we have a problem","If you are buying this CD with your mind tacked to'this is the dream of evan and chan' - you might bedissapointed...The synergy witnessed on Dntel's possibilities justdoesn't hit the mark for me on Give up. Gibbard comesacross as more whiney emoesque than I can handle. Ifound the lyrics to be a little too pop-floaty andmeloncholy, and Tamborello's production to take an(even without the vocals) uninspired back seat toGibbard.Not horrible, but nothing fresh, and for anyone whohas followed Gibbard or Tamborello - a possible dissapointment."
5,Amazing. Just amazing.,"I first heard ""Brand New Colony"" on my friend's iPod in English class. We both started crying.I bought the CD after previewing just a few of the other songs, and as kind of an impulse buy it was an excellent decision. The vocals are wonderful, the music is catchy and the lyrics are awesome. All the songs are good, although ""This Place is a Prison"" is the weakest lyrically. ""The District Sleeps Alone Tonight"" stands out, as does ""Nothing Better,"" which is kind of a duet, ""Brand New Colony"" and ""Clark Gable,"" especially the chorus. ""I want so badly to believe, that 'there is truth, that love is real'..."" I'm not sure what to compare The Postal Service to, as they are so different from everything else I've heard. They're amazing. Just amazing."
5,Child of the 80's? Enjoy music with layers?? Get this album!,"WOW WOW WOW!! It is rare that I find a gem like this. Postal Service has obvious allegiances to the 80's... Some Human League feel (especially track 4 ""nothing better"")...heavy electronica... the music has many layers and is quite complicated when you analyze it...but provides a seemless listening experience.My favorite song on this album keeps changing... Currently it is track 9 ""Brand New Colony"" with AMAZING lyrics like: ""I'll be the platform shoes and undo what heredity's done to you; you won't have to strain to look into my eyes... I'll be your winter coat buttoned and zipped straight to the throat with the collar up so you won't catch cold...""Buy this one!!! Enjoy!!! Tell your friends!! They will thank you... mine all did!!"
5,You've Got Mail!,"Ben Gibbard, the lead singer and songwriter for Deathcab for Cutie, teams up with several other indie rock stars here to produce a wonderful album. Give Up sounds like Deathcab only in the sense that Gibbards voice is still the same soulful light that it is with his other band. The lyrical content is definitely a lot more upbeat than transatlantism. The Electronic sound of the album can sometimes be distracting, but at the same time it lends the album a steady beat that helps a person escape to Gibbards peaceful world if just for a little while.The lead singer from Rilo Kiley can also be heard singing backing vocals and was a pleasant surprise when I heard her. While the Postal Service may sound kinda like Deathcab they are definitely their own band and I would recommend Give Up to anyone who liked Deathcab or who likes softer indie rock."
3,Songs Go From Best to Worst,"I really have enjoyed listening to this album, especially in the car, stopped next to people at a traffic light, at 3AM. It's a pretty solid effort from a band I saw on MTV2 at 4 in the morning. The songs pretty much go in order of best to worst. The first two songs are great, #3 Sleep In is pretty damn good, especially the JFK references, 4-7 are average and tolerable, while I often get lost trying to listen through songs 8-10 and go right back to ""The district sleeps alone tonight"", and start all over. Overall, the songs hook you a bit and its a nice effort."
4,Honest Review,"This is album is new and different. You really have to like what they are doing to be down with it. I suggest sampelling the files. Also, Even though I really like it, it gets old very quickly (4 stars)"
3,Postal Service delivers relief from your cynicism,"Looking for a safe place for your idealistic yearnings and optimistic attitude about intimate relationships? You've found it. Get this album any way you can, and you'll find a safe haven from cynicism in Ben Gibbard's campaign 10-part (or are there 11 tracks?) speech for Emo Poster Child of 2003.""The Distict Sleeps Tonight"" and ""Such Great Heights"" get the party off to a promising start, with dancing electronic beats providing a smooth yet infectiously catchy canvas for classic Gibbard poetry like, ""I have to speculate, that God himself did make us into corresponding shapes like puzzle pieces of the mind.""As further proved by positive pop-romance-fantasy gems like ""Clark Gable,"" and ""Brand New Colony,"" the mission of Postal Service is a rousing success. Whether you can put your cynical tendencies on hold long enough to believe in it is up to you."
5,Great album,"This is a great collaboration album, driving Ben Gibbard into a more techno-pop electronic sound. Adding to the charm of this album is his erronious reference to sports in Nothing Better, discussing the goalie tending the net in the fourth quarter. In what sport is there a goalie and a fourth quarter? A must buy for Death Cab fans, and then go get the Iron and Wine cover of Such Great Heights."
1,Worst Band In The World,"I can't believe that I'm NOT ALLOWED to give this zero stars.This band is garbage. The record is worse than garbage. It's septic sludge. The music is unoriginal, cloying and boring. The vocals are the most annoying sound I've ever heard. I wish the courts would gag and restrain this band.This band couldn't stop a war if they had a nuclear bomb.Boycott!"
1,Crap,"If u like terrible music with terrible vacalists, u'll enjoy The Postal Service. This is untalented stuff, sounds like lame 80's nintendo sounds were used to make this album. Don't waste ur time or money."
3,80s synthpop through an emo lens,"Such Great Heights is what hooked me into Postal Service since i am a big fan of the music that seems reflected here at times.. New Order, Erasure, Electronic, Pet Shop Boys.. its a beautiful electro pop single.The problem is, its not a bad album, except for me, Mr Gibbards vocals get on my nerves after a song or two.. they are just too, hmm, sensitive suburban white boy from madison wisconsin or something.Is it daring for an indie band to pick up electronic music, yes it is.. i give them props. Is it particularly daring music in itself.. not really in the electronic music world. certainly not as revolutionary as Joy Divisions change to New Order, or as interesting as Everything But The Girls transformation from lounge pop to house and drum n bass. It goes down a slightly Bjorkish road of DSP/Glitch Pop, but nothing horribly daring as say a Matmos, Plaid or Pole."
3,its all bloops and beeps,"at times this cd has promise and the songs sound they are building but they generally don't go anywhere. the vocals are irritating and overall the sound gets dull fast.there is one song that i do really like, #2 such great heights, but i think its because its reminiscient of several eighties songs; and i get a kick out of the lyrics to #5 recycled air, but that's because it's about the ice storm and i like that movie (it is about the ice storm right?)"
2,Not quite there,"""Give Up"" had a lot of potential from the start, but fell flat after a few tracks. A couple of songs stand out (""Such Great Heights"" and ""We Will Become Silhouettes"") and are really great tracks, but the rest of the album could easily be mistaken for some guy sitting around a studio messing with the Super Mario Brothers soundtrack.Ben Gibbard, the lead singer, has a very weak, faint voice that sometimes makes you want to cringe, especially when it's in a somber setting, but all that changes when he gets a solid beat and catchy rhythm moving. Unfortunately most of the tracks didn't provide the jolt he needed, so it's tough to get through the whole album without losing focus."
3,Fun music and nothing more.,"As an avid electronic fan, many of my friends suggested I pick up this album because it 'is simply amazing!'I wasn't exactly dissapointed, but I would certaintly not call this album amazing. While the music is fun and the beats are 'jumpin', this album is just that. Fun. Nothing more, and there's room for discussion if it's nothing less. The songs all sound pre-programmed and I would guess this album took a month tops to make.Any comparison to Radiohead belittles the name of Radiohead and all serious electronic acts such as the Notwist, Ars Phoenix and Fake Problems.This album isn't a must have, but if you have spare time, download it. It's fun pop music, and I hope they don't make another CD."
1,"Pointless game, too simple and you will ask yourself why?","A pointless game with the most basic gameplay, two tops going at it until one stops spinning or is knocked out of the stadium. You do this throughout the whole game and gets really repetitive. Most of the special beast that your beyblade can have are carbon copies of the other ones and have almost the same animation every time you do the attack. This game is just a cash in to the toy line and you'll have more fun with the actual beyblade and friends to play with them then this game. Don't Buy!If you do buy it then have fun wasting your money."
5,CarCharger great deal,"Purchased this car charger and it was original in package! Great vendor, great service, highly recommend!!!"
1,"Ridiculous, just as expected","As soon as I saw the first and last name of the author, I was suspicious of a radical, African dragon-fire response to Ruby Payne. And that's what it was. A few logical points now and then, but the wrong spin put on those few points. Payne's book was well-thought out and had evidence that was obvious and believable. Jawanza Kunjufu does not want to accept an educational standard set by the successful in America. His plan would not be good in Africa, but will lead to third world standards for everybody in America."
2,Black students. Middle class teachers. Unsupported claims.,"As a high school teacher and university instructor in the education field, I have had a variety of experiences to help inform my teaching and my work in helping others become more effective educators. Possessing a desire to instill multicultural and multiracial appreciation within the teachers I work with, I thought Kunjufu's book would bring forth ideas to better prepare teachers to work with non-white students. I was apprehensive at first after reading the back cover and skimming the first chapter. After two chapters I had learned nothing and was very disappointed by the lack of evidence provided for the mountain of claims the author makes. The best part of the book is the references page and having been published in 2002, the little data Kunjufu does provide is out-dated and has been done better by other authors."
3,"Great Premise, but not enough for a whole book","This book deals with a great topic that has been an unfortunate part of virtually every organization since the dawn of time. With such a rich history of abuse and how wide spread this kind of behavior is in society, this book had drew upon a little more than the basic premise in the title and a handful of almost incidental stories from the author.This book documents a very real problem and proposes some very actionable methods for dealing with the issue. Please be patient with the author. For some reason he seems long winded while at the same time gloses over some very important points.All in all, a good book, but one you will read once and probably never pick up again."
2,Don't Hire Jerks,"Obvious and not terribly useful advice: don't be a jerk, don't hire jerks, don't accept a job working for a jerk, and if you have to work with a jerk, try to avoid him or her as much as possible. The one interesting claim in the book is that research shows that negative interactions affect one's mood about five times as strongly as positive ones."
5,No A-hole Rule,"Awesome read. The world is full of A-holes, he affirms this and gives examples of how to deal with them."
2,another self-help biz book for the recycle pile,"The book is fun to read, but contains few gems of useful information. There are a few attempts to extend specific examples into general situations, but there was little that I got out of it. The premise and content of the book is based on an article that he wrote. Unfortunately, the book seems simply an extension of that article."
2,Wider Ramifications,"Although Professor Sutton's book contains some useful information, its universal application is at best impractical and at worst dangerous. I work with politicians during the day and perform in community theater at night. If Sutton's 'no ***hole rule' were applied to both spheres, our streets would be full of anarchists and our stages completely empty. We need to strike a happy medium. Let's start with Amorah Quan Yin, the Kentucky-born psychic who wrote those two seminal works 'The Pleiadian Workbook: Awakening Your Divine Ka' and 'The Pleiadian Tantric Workbook: Awakening Your Divine Ba'. I read recently that she plans to awaken Ma and Pa in time for their podiatry appointment."
1,Fun for awhile until the novelty wears off,I thought the book was funny for awhile but quickly grew tired of the author's statistics and nebulous solutions. I didn't find the solutions offered to be very constructive or clear. The novelty soon wore off.
1,Not for me,Could barely get past the first few pages. Thought it would be more helpful in helping me deal with work place bullies but alas was not the case.
1,Not very helpful would not suggest you buy this,Not a very helpful book...cute title..cute stories...but doesn't tell you how to DEAL with them at all. His suggestions are 1) get rid of them 2) don't let them in your business. Doesn't address how to really deal with them. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
2,A-Salt and Battery,"I stopped reading this low-content book approximately halfway through, at the point where the author narrates an account of a waitress who doused a drunk customer's head with salt ... not because he was being nasty toward her, or hitting on her, but simply because he hadn't been tipping her with the rounds of drinks he ordered. In the eyes of Robert Sutton, Ph.D., it was the non-tipping customer who was the a-hole, not the obviously abusive waitress (who should have been fired on the spot, and charged with assault and battery for good measure).Aside from that world-class academic insight, life is too short to waste on books like this--a 1,000-word article would have said all that Sutton has to say on the subject."
2,Not very good,"When purchasing this album, I was expecting a more dream theater/fates warning feel, but instead I got very odd music, with no driving metal force that I love from bands like DT and Symphony X. Don't let the band members and their histories fool you, because this project is different from their early works. It has a lot of strange sound effects from keyboards and background voices discussing anti-government issues. Frankly, I was quite dissapointed in the outcome of this album due to the potential it had and the talent it consisted of."
2,not album of the year...,"I did enjoy 'When You're Ready', but it's not quite enough save this project. If you're just getting into any of these guys, I would say head straight for the classics: Images & Words, Awake, and Focus by Cynic. This album is more proof that when prog groups try out song-craft they usually fall on their asses."
5,It is the Bonus Disc!,"OSI is an interesting side project involving Dream Theater and Porcupine Tree members. Quite honesly, the first dics in this set is the American release of the original OSI album (2003). It is reminiscent of Too- Eistein, but on the BONUS disc you hear this band in heavy prog action! Even there cover of Set The Controls For The Heart of the Sun is EXCELLENT! The book-like case sits very well on your shelf. Awesome spin!"
1,Only 1 envelope,"At this price I expected at least a pack of 10 or 25. But NO, it was just 1. A massive rip off!"
5,Outstanding AI Book,"Amazing effort in compiling historical roots, facts, concepts, applications from a relatively recent formal discipline (about 50 years old) and always in evolution, very inspiring piece of work I must add. This book goes from the very AI concepts towards the depth AI modeling methods analysis with clear and easy explanations beyond any other book I have ever read. A must for every AI enthusiast, reader, teacher and student, highly recommended if you want to contribute to this science even by yourself."
5,Best Broadview AI Book,"I have had this book for the past seven years and everytime some new problem comes up, there is something you can find related in this book! The book is very comprehensive and has a lot of breadth and reasonable depth. Although, if you want to go deep into a particular topic like Language processing or Bayesian Networks, or anything, the book will give you a good broad understanding, some basics and useful pointers to literature. That's the most useful way I found to use this book. Of course, the recent online course from the authors relied heavily on this book (although they used the latest edition) and helped to further strengthen the concepts. Best book to get started on most AI topics. Highly recommended."
4,Needs to provide coded examples,"Lack of coded examples. Language is muddy in spots. Annoyingly redundant at various points. Obviously two authors. Terms/nomenclature are not always defined and SHOULD always be defined before being used. The pseudocode is a mish mash - takes some getting used to. GUYS! for heavens sake supplement with REAL programming language examples - PREFERABLY C++. Not a single WORKING rational agent in the text. So, you know what you are doing? PROVE IT! In general good information - definitely a two semester text."
2,A third or second book the subject,"Generally I would agree with the reviewer who titled his review ""Mindstorms meets NN; same strengths and weaknesses"".This is a decent book that provides some interesting insights into the subject matter. There are some very nice intuitive ideas that gives meaning to some of the math. Unfortunately, other parts of the text lack this intuition and seem like a presentation of network structure and algorithms more than a presentation of the ideas behind them.I started my research in this area with a software engineering and management background with some intermediate signal processing experience on top. I also read Duda and Hart's Pattern Recognition book along with months of literature review on the subject before tackling this one. I must say that I am still confused on many points.This is not an introductory text and will most certainly require the reader to seek out other references to fill in its gaps."
4,GREAT GALACTICA'S GHOST !,"WHEN I FIRST SAW PREVEIWS OF THIS SHOW, I THOUGHT, OH NO THEY'RE REDOING THIS PEICE OF 70'S TRIPE ! BOY, WAS I WRONG ! THEY TOOK THAT OLD SHOW AND MADE IT INTO A WELL WRITTEN BEAUTIFULY ACTED KNOCK OUT. THE STORY LINE IS SO DEEP AND LAYERED I'M MESSMERIZED BY EACH EPPISODE. I COULD'NT WAIT FOR THE 90 MIN. FINAL EPPISODE THIS YEAR, AND YET I WAS SO SAD TO SEE IT END.I'VE WATCHED THIS SEASON 2 DVD SET OVER B4 WATCHING NEW EPISODES, VERY HELPFUL FOR GETTING THE MANY NUANCES OF THE TERRIFIC CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. I CAN'T RECOMEND ENOUGH !"
5,Not your typical Sci-Fi,"Battlestar Galactica season 2 continues the high quality that the mini-series and season one displayed. More than a sci-fi story, this series includes great drama, dialogue, and cinematography."
3,Universal should be slapped for this atrocity.,"The show is amazing. I can't possibly say enough about how the quality of this show surpasses every drama on television today. Forget that it's sci-fi. That's barely a factor here. It's about human life and how we value the complex strands that connect us to one another and other life.What's really insulting is that Universal has the gall to release the first half of this season for the price of a full season worth of shows. Sure, it's on sale now. HOWEVER, the fact that they feel they are justified in charging you $49.99 for less than 10 hours worth of scripted programming is ghastly. I'd give this set a solid ""5"". The show deserves it. Universal's greedy blunder knocks two points off of what should have been a perfect score."
1,LOVE BSG - hate the technology,"I'd love to post a review of whatever it is that Ron feels like telling us. I'm sure it will be clever and insightful, and a hopeful fan can only wish that along with revealing details of behind the scenes at BSG, he might drop a word or two about the status of ""Caprica"" as well.I'd love to see all of this. Unfortunately, I've been downloading this 22 minute video for HOURS. I've got DSL, and even though I've been waiting to see this all day, my download stands at less than 40%. I love the show and support the efforts to expand new formats - especially considering the broadcast delay until January '08. However, until technology catches up to the concept, I don't consider episode downloads viable.Back to stone knives and bear skins for you, Ron!"
4,Solid sophomore season,"While not as entralling as the first season, it's worth wathcing if for no other reason than just to get through it because season 3 rocks."
2,"""Enough""?? Not hardly! That's the problem!","I've read all the reviews here and it's fine that ""Captain Justice"" has the cash to spend on costly half season sets that don't have what Ron Moore said they would. It's also fine that some of us aren't happy with that. Some of us would prefer something more affordable, complete, and closer to what Moore said it would be.The ""Captain"" would have you believe that there's no problem with Universal trying to milk the fans of their hard earned cash. I don't agree. I'd prefer to be able to purchase complete seasons with what Moore said would be on them. I also don't agree with the claims that by not buying this we are killing the series so we should just buy it and shut up. It's sad that some fans think that approach is the best way to deal with other fans. It's even sadder that we've been deprived of what Moore said would be on these DVDs and that some people are perfectly happy about that."
1,"1/2 A Season, C'Mon!",This is only the 1st half of Season 2... wait for the full season to come out and send a message to the studios that we will not tolerate this kind of stuff.
1,warning,this product is not season two it is in fact it is only half. if you are looking to build your collection wait untill the full season comes out on dvd. another money grab item!!
1,Series great!!! Read review for the rating.,"The show is great. It has a lot of character development. My only hesitancy is that, unlike Babylon 5 (my benchmark comparison), the character development seems forced; like, who knows when we'll be cancelled...let's let everybody know almost everything about everybody quickly.But, this review is about the release format. One big black mark for the Amazon reviewer, who refused to take the studio to task for this rip-off. I can't call it anything else. We all wait for the series to be released one year at a time. What's next...one episode at a time?I do not intend buying this until the year is together, and I encourage all readers to do likewise. Delay your gratification until the entire year is released. Or else, we will begin to see similar marketing for other favorite shows. Let's stop this now!!!"
1,Love BSG but D/L NOT Mac Compatible!,"Love BSG but the Windows only download software has GOT to go. Amazon do you have ANY idea how many people got tired of waiting 6+ years for Vista only to see what a POS it is? I ordered a MacBook and a Mac Mini from you IMMEDIATELY and haven't looked back......i guess I could always fire up my VMWare Fusion to use the Unbox software.....Amazon can you say ""Mac Compatible?"
4,Too short,"This is a fantastic sequel to Season 1. Unfortunately, it is waaaay too short, and seems to hold only part one of season 2. But who can wait? This series is fun and loves to keep you hanging...and guessing."
4,Edge of your seat TV,"The saga of the survivors of humanity and their cylon pursuers continues with more action, drama, love, lust, adventure, mystery, political intrigue, and every other adjective that made the miniseries and season one so compelling. You will grow to love unlikely characters, see beloved characters change before your very eyes, and watch as secrets that will blow your mind unfold. I am so glad I did not have to wait a week between watching these episodes!The reason this gets 4 instead of 5 stars is the fact that they split the season into two packages. An obvious money making ploy. Other than that this is fracking awesome!"
1,"Great Show, Rip Off DVD Set!",Don't buy this. It's half of Season 2. Wait for the whole season to come out and save your money.Great Show though!
1,Characters-no.,"Characters lacked complication of any sort, simply awful. Couldn't finish this one, and I normally make a point to see through things to the bitter end."
5,"Rhapsody, Child of Blood",This is the best fantasy work since Raymond Feist's Riftwars. I couldn't put it down - and this from a woman who has been reading fantasy and sci-fi for 35 years. It has all the makings of a classic. The characters are wonderfully wrought and the humor she injects is a delightful counterpoint to the serious business of a quest against a pervasive evil. I can't wait for the next two books in the trilogy.
5,Highly recommended,"This is a tremendous book. I am a fifteen year old high school student and read fantay all the time. It is much better than omost of the stuff out there. I am outragged that anyone would say it is slow. how can anyone read the scene in the field with Michel's men and say there is no action? I could not put this book down for more than the time to eat dinner or sleep, and even them I dreamed about it. I will keep dreaming til the sequel comes out, and then I will have something else wonderful to dream about."
4,Pretty good over all,"I bought this book on sale about six months ago, and just started reading... Got addicted to it and couldn't stop till the end. Over all it is a really good book for beginning fantasy readers, but for more experienced ones it isn't that good.Just like many other people said, history lessons take for ever, and the most terrible thing is the ""Miss Perfect"".I didn't skip a word till that happened and after - I skipped pages because all they had was how perfect Rhapsody is.Characters are well developed, but again they get degradated toward the end. One more thing... she could definately use a bit less nightmare descriptions - i got sick of reading how she woke up skreaming and all that rubish!Wish I could give it a five, but there is simply too many flaws. It could have been better."
1,"Boring, Romantic Drivel","I found this book tedious and annoying. It was like reading a romance novel put into the Sci-fi fantasy format. A-la Mills & Boone.Some of the adventures were fun, but overall the book just went on, and on, and on..."
4,"A ""for-sure"" Hit Series","I recommend this book to any reader, even if your not a science-fiction fantasy fan. It hooks you in and keeps you there. When I first bought the book I didn't really care for it much because I only read the first couple of chapters, and I gave up on it. Eventually I picked it back up and I was really surprised at how good it was. The character's personalities are developed really well, and it's not the same-old magic and toadstools kind of book. Haydon does such a good job that when you read the last page you're mad that it ended. I can't wait till I can afford to buy her other books."
4,"Wonderful drama, little past","I really enjoyed reading this book. I'm not sure why thought. It must be Haydon's style of writing that really draws one in, as well as her ability to develop mystery. There was, however, at times too much mystery which caused a lack of evelopment in some areas, such as world building and character background. Some people have said she lacks character development but this is untrue. The characters are complex and 3 dimensional but there is very little known about their pasts, hopefully Haydon will reveal their histories in furute books."
5,i loved this book!,"i have been reading fantasy books for years and this is the best first novel that i have ever read. i loved the characters and the plot especially Rhapsody's and Gwydion's love story. i cant wait for the next book in the series. i would really recommend this book to anyone looking for an interesting,evocative read, it really gets under your skin."
5,Amazing fantasy debut,"Elizabeth Haydon has scored a real winner with ""Rhapsody"". This is a fantastic tale that keeps the reader guessing as to what is coming next. ""Rhapsody"" is a very memorable saga full of adventure and wonderfully fresh ideas about fantasy. Too many books in this genre today are cut from the same mold-not this one. Haydon has created a vivid yard with the talent of a master. This is a book that will cause you to find reasons to avoid other tasks in order to read it."
5,Great new author!,"I was so impressed with this book, then of course I went to the store to find it and had so much trouble, it became my first online purchase ever. Anybody who likes fantasy, or romance, or good, well written books in general, will like this.It will keep you interested, but it is definitely not candy. I thought the characters were the best I have seen in any type of book in a long time."
5,Time Is Slipping Away,"I have read and purchase this book ""Time Is Slipping Away"" by author Jake Roussel. This young man, shows us that we all have obsticles to overcome, yet I couldn't imagine not being able to use my eyes. The poem ""Through These Eyes"" is must for everyone to read. Looking at life through Jake's eyes, makes me more thankful. It please me to see such positive and talented writing from someone, so young. I hope Jake will continue to publish more books. Jake you have my support."
1,Product blows up while charging!!!,"Please be very careful with this product!!! My son and daughter both received this as a holiday gift from hteir grandparents - one of them blew up right out of the electric socket in the wall - there was a crackling sound and then a gunshot sound as the power cord was blown off of the wall! There was black soot and smoke all over the place and the power cord was blown apart into many, many pieces! I am [...] both products as I think that it is a real safety hazard - This product is geared for CHILDREN!!!! and it is not SAFE!!!!"
3,Nice DVD Player,"The DVD Player is nice, but the battery is extremely heavy for such a small item. The manufacturer should consider replacing the battery with a lighter weight battery. Also, you can only recharge the battery 120 times so I'm not sure what use the player will be after the 120 times. I can't find any information on how to order a replacement battery. Overall, the player is nice and my son enjoys it."
2,WARNING!!! AC ADAPTER BLEW UP,"I purchased two of these DVD players for my kids christmas present. On Christmas morning my daughter watched a movie with hers, she then disconnected the AC adapter from the player but did not remove the adapter from the wall plug in. The adapter blew up. I have a big black mark up my wall and my carpet burned from a piece that blew out of the adapter. Thankfully I was in the next room."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!,I have three of these. They were given to my kids at Christmas. None of them work. You can watch one movie and then you have to charge the battery again which would be fine if the battery actually took a charge. I left it plugged in for over 20 hourse and it still wasn't charged. Each one had the same problems. My girlfriend also had one for her son and she experienced the same problem. I would totally recommend saving your money and purchasing a portable dvd player from circuit city or some other electronic store for a few bucks more. I am very disappointed in Toys R Us for putting this garbage unit on their shelves. It clearly needs some more work.
4,Keep a journal and use what you record,"As a former colleague of Chris Leland, I know from whence I speak. Leland refers often to anecdotes that friends told him, articles from obscure newspapers, etc. and it all goes into his journal. Time passes, and that nugget re-appears in his novels. He gives many examples from his own work and precisely what he did to bring that item to life.The lesson to be learned is: Writers, you must always be on the alert to gather incidents, stories, characters, mannerisms, language and moments in time. Record them for subsequent use. And then, transform them and use them."
3,Lots of examples,"I did not mind this book because it gave me a good idea about different and important financial events, but there did not seem to be that much depth to this book. There was just a bunch of examples that proved a point, not too much more than that."
4,First power washer,"The unit is very light and easy to trasport. I used it to power wash wood decking supports before painting. It worked very well, although I did have to turn it off so the pump could cool down after working it very hard on a very hot day.Suggestions:1) buy the 25 ft extention hose, which prevented having to constantly move the unit around.2) attach a short garden hose to the water inlet. The water inlet connection fitting on the bottom of the unit is difficult to reach and the inside connection of the water inlet fitting came loose each time I tried to disconnect the garden hose. The short garden hose left on the machine fixed that issue permanently."
1,Junk,"Took this product out of the box, plugged it in, motor dies after less than 2 seconds. Apparently this is a common problem with this product. Spend the few extra $$$ and get a name brand."
1,Broke in first 5 minutes,"I used this to wash my back deck. In the first four minutes I could see I was going to love this washer. But then the nozzle cracked along a seam and it stopped working. I'm waiting to hear back from the manufacturer. If I don't get a response, back to Amazon it goes.One question I have is why does a high-pressure nozzle have a seam it in? Seems like an elementary engineering mistake to me.Update: The manufacturer did send me a replacement for the entire wand, not just the tip. It took about a week. I've not had time to use it yet but I'll update again soon with results."
1,Nozzle snapped under pressure,"Within a half hour of taking the power washer out of the box, the plastic?!? spray nozzle snapped... one would think that under 1600 PSI something other than plastic would be used for at least lining the inside of the nozzle... but I guess not...Called the manufacturer for a replacement part and the rep I spoke with knew virtually nothing about the product (""I only work in the call center"") and told me it would be 12-14 business days for a new part. So this one is on its way back to Amazon.This is the exact same problem as the reviewer below, so it seems like a systemic problem with the nozzle design."
4,The perfect mouse,"My daughter, who is now five, is a big Dora fan so when she needed a small mouse to fit her hand I bought this one. She has been using this mouse for a year now with her imac and they are like one."
5,Im so confused...,"As to why i loved this movie so much! Their is only 1 setting in the entire movie but the acting/action/scripting were just too awesome, i dont understand it at all!"
4,Deliciously unique!,"I first tried a Mallo Cup when I was in Chicago recently for a convention. The combination of marshmallow, chocolate, and just a hint of coconut is divine. The only thing that would make it better would be if it was made of dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate."
3,Didn't Last Long,"I really enjoyed this all-in-one machine. The print quality was exellent. The scanning function was average speed. This is 'light duty' machine for home or small office. A noticeable drawback was the small ink cartridges. They run really fast.But then---the printer broke. I had gone through 15 or so black cartridges and then it flat broke.(The scanner worked fine.)The cartridge carriage stuck and made a loud grinding noise. I called Canon and they gave me a brief tech support session, and the tech said it couldn't be fixed. He offered to let me buy another one with a discount (20%).I really liked it, but it didn't last long."
1,Avoid this Printer,"This is my first (and last) Cannon printer. The Canon MP960 is the most temperamental, unreliable printer I have ever owned. The ink cartridge system is messy and awkward. After only owning it for about 3 months, I have had nothing but trouble with it. I am going back to HP printers."
2,A flawed CD,"It has a big flaw in the middle of the CD where it is all broken up. It came from Overstock and I would never order anotherCD again if it comes from them. Their merchandise is not of first rate standard. Unfortunately, I am unable to return it since I discharged the envelope and bill, because I thought it was all in order. Sorry for that."
2,A disappointing season of a great series,"I held off watching BSG until the series had run to a close, and was greatly impressed by Season 1. Season 2, although it had its low points, was also excellent. By contrast, Season 3 is an assortment of low points punctuated by the occasional great scene or episode.I have to agree with other reviewers who have noted that the drama throughout Season 3 felt contrived and overwrought. The biggest issue in my opinion is that I couldn't confidently say of the writers, ""And they have a plan."" Conflicts between characters are drawn out seemingly to fill time; the Cylons transform from frightening to nonsensical; compelling questions from earlier seasons are answered badly while uninteresting - or downright annoying - twists are introduced.There are some very entertaining high points in BSG Season 3... but they don't begin to make up for all the lows."
3,was it me?,I was so excited to see that BSG Season 3 was on sale (t'was my favorite season) and so I bought it.When it arrived I was slightly disappointed that the item was used. It never stated anywhere in the transaction that it was used. I normally notice such things and I would not have purchased it.So I suppose It's my fault for not really looking hard enough...?BUT all that said... Every disk does work. Just some wear around the outside of the box and on a couple of the dvd's. Overall I'm just satisfied to have the content... right?Just look closely to make sure what your getting is what you want. New or Used. that is all.
2,Shipped wrong DVD's,"The item is great once i got the correct DVD's in it. I purchased them new, but when they arrived they were all banged up and I had disks from season one in the case.... Not a new product.But a great season to watch!!!"
4,Good but not great,"Video quality was vert good, some good extras. I could live without the 'extra' comments and noise during the webcasts"
5,"Incredible product, but consider not using Super Saver Shipping","This is a must-have for BSG fans. Season 3 outdoes the first two seasons by far. This edition has great never-before-released deleted scenes and director's commentary.My only problem with this order was that I chose Super Saver Shipping (the standard free Amazon shipping using USPS). I pre-ordered the item about a month before it was released, and it never arrived once it was shipped. Amazon did fix the solution immediately, though, by sending a new copy within hours of my informing customer service of the item's non-arrival.My problem could have been a one-time occurrence or a problem with the local post office, but several of my friends using Super Saver Shipping have noticed delays and non-arrivals, too. If you absolutely want this item (and others) sooner, you may want to go with shipping that is NOT Super Saver Shipping."
2,Depressing,"I'm a big science fiction fan, and I love the concept and the special effects of this show. But by the time I got to season 3 it got so depressing watching these people have one horrible thing after another happen to them with no apparrent hope that things would ever get better, that I just had to stop watching."
5,Battlestar galactica season three/DVD,"BSG season three is wonderful. All the extras and director and producer video blogs really get you inside the set. That is very interesting to me.If you are hooked on BSG, buy season three. You already know that you can watch it again and again and get something new out of it each time. Best thing on TV. Thanks Scifi network."
2,Frackin Mess,"What a frackin awful mess. I really liked Seasons 1 & 2. Season 3 however was a waste of time as it barely moves the story along but instead wallows in pointless subplots and flashbacks. What were the writers and producers smoking? Maybe two episodes are even worth watching, at most. At this point I am not sure I'll even bother with Season 4. Don't waste your time, pass Season 3 up."
2,Great series but...a warning for your kids,"I was turned off by the number of actors smoking in this series, a bit of a warning to parents who care about their children's health. This is a science fiction series and smoking would and should be totally unnecessary. The very public lack of scruples on this subject by the producer of this show unfortunately makes it impossible for me to recommend this otherwise excellent series.' Letter to studio heads from 31 Attorneys General, May 1, 2007'Each time a member of the [film] industry releases another movie that depicts smoking, it does so with the full knowledge of the harm it will bring to children who watch it.'I think this says it all.DJ"
5,Best Frakkin Show On TV,"I love a good ""Space Opera"". This season took my breath away when they jumpped a Battlestar into atmosphere. My nerd meter went way off the charts. Not only is it major eye candy, but when I hear the theme song begin, it's like I am transported to the dark, hungry, cold, yet hopeful world of trying to get home. There's nothing like impossible odds to define a preson's character. Rapture."
3,Great photos and helpful text,"The book is helpful and directive with good explanations on how to set up on-location lighting, mostly using natural light. It is beneficial to me, however, it deals primarily with medium format, non-automatic, cameras and equipment; only one chapter deals with 35mm and autofocus cameras. Even though the book was written in 2003 the author never mentions digital photography, never even touches on it. That is a drawback. If you are using digital, this book may not be good for you. The information about use of lighting, diffusers, and reflectors is still a great help. I do recommend the book."
3,Slow,"This was my first time reading one of Beverly Lewis' books. I was somewhat disappointed. I think I kept on reading hoping to come up on something unpredictable...something to add flavor to the story. Maybe I needed to read the books that came before. I did read it to the end however, but it dragged. I'm hard-pressed in deciding to try her other books."
1,The Crossroad,I like Beverly Lewis books because she mainly writes about the Amish and I like reading aout them. She writes romance books and they are always good clean reading.
5,Excellent Book,It is a marvelous and outstanding book if you would like to know about the history of India and Pakistan. This book give you first hand accounts on why India was divided. It is an exceptional source of information on the political leaders of that time in India.
5,Excellent.,Excellent book. Great for learning how to retain words by using an association process. By using the method taught in this book I have gone on to memorize and retain countless new words in Spanish and other languages as well. Highly recommended.
5,I'm positive it was the iodine that helped me get over rosacea,"For years I had rosacea and it seemed to be getting worse as time went on. Then I hit perimenopause with its hot flashes and palpatations and mood swings. I decided to try iodine, putting a circle about the size of a quarter on my skin somewhere where I could watch it. If it absorbed within 12 hours, then I knew that I was deficient and kept putting it on until it was no longer absorbing. After six months, my rosacea is completely gone, my hot flashes are not nearly so bad and my palpitations are much less. Before I started using the iodine, my doctor had me on thyroid medication and blood pressure medicine and I felt even worse than I had before. The iodine worked for me."
5,"You can give a teen a good book, but you can't make them read/follow the advice.","Saw the book in a bookstore. It was very well organized and had lots of good information. Sent it to a teen whose family has minimal money management skills. Teen lives over 500 miles away. I don't think it was read. Real shame, because it has so much helpful information. Moral - be sure the recipient is ready to learn."
4,Lovely board,Product is nicely made and is very pretty. The squares are rather large so make sure you are looking for this size board.
3,"Good, hearty metal","I never listened to Armored Saint or gave them a chance, then a friend gave me the Revelation cd. I must say I was surprised how good the cd was, I especially like the riffing and vocals of John Bush, this is a much better fit for him than Anthrax. Anyhow any one new to Armored Saint, this would be a good place to start. Laters....."
2,Dissapointing,"The picture for this item shows 4 boxes, I only received three. The boxes are pretty but hardly got any candy or other goodies inside. Honestly, if this wasnt a valentines day gift I would have sent it back. Next time I will go with another company. Not worth the money at all when I could have just bought decorative boxes at the dollar store and filled them myself."
5,Variety of items - Packaged nicely,I sent this as a gift to my mom....She said that she liked the variety of items....She also told me that she was going to keep the boxes to use in the future when she needed to package gifts....
3,SMall boxes,"Three small boxes... seems a little small for the price. Gave as a gift, so I hope the snacks were fabulous to make it worth the money!"
5,The perfect gift,"I sent this to a close friend, and she loved it. It is perfect as a surprise for someone. The delivery of the product was fast, delivered ahead of time, completely satisfied with product and service."
1,Foul Lang and Difficult to use,"This dictionary wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped. Dividing the word lists by category made it difficult to look up a word while watching BBCA. There was quite a bit of crude and foul language as well, not just in the word lists but in the author's definitions and examples. Many words and phrases heard on tv weren't included. Disappointing. I'm looking for another dictionary."
3,Neither Deep nor Enlghtening,"I enjoy watching British comedies and my wife spent some time in Scotland, so I was looking for a treasure trove of slang that was not such common knowledge. On this point I was disappointed. If you have watched enough episodes of BBCAmerica you will have heard most of it.Similarly, I was expecting a bit more depth to the list; perhaps some back story, history or examples from popular culture. Instead, it has a few pages for each section; sections revolve around food, sex, travel and the like. There is no background on the subject; it is a list of terms and their meaning. The author tries to be light and funny, but after the tenth ""definition"" it gets stale.So, the lack of anything new word-wise combined with the lack of anything knew about those words makes for a dull book.Good for those who know little about the language or don't watch British shows."
4,Knickers in of a twist : A dictionary of British slang,"I recently purchased the book as a gift for my Argentinian daughter-in-law. The book contains so many of the 'slang' expressions I slip into our conversations, that it has become great sport for us to exchange and then hunt the meaning or origin behind what can be judged a bizarre phrase or word. It is much more than a 'coffee table' tome. Originally my son or myself had to give an explanation which was to the best of our understanding, but now with this book as reference all parties are fully informed. It goes a long way to explain to newcommers of the English language the idiosyncracies of British slang."
4,Buying a second set,"I bought these speakers for my parents for Christmas several years ago. They still use them, and I am buying them a second set. The signal will go through walls & rooms, and the speakers work great outdoors with the base antenna indoors. My parents' home is large (3500+ sq ft), and the speakers work in all locations throughout the house. My only complaint is that they do tend to cut out for a second when people are standing or walking between the base antenna and speaker."
5,Carolyn M.,"What a wonderful, well-written, touching story! It has forced me to look at my own life from a different perspective. I would love to read a follow-up with more stories about Adam."
1,disappointed,"I found this book to be very disappointing. In my opinion, it lacks a feel of authenticity. I believe there is partial truth, but I couldn't help feeling that the author exaggerated and sensationalized a great deal of the story."
3,Both moving and exasperating,"Although I admit that I could not put the book down -it is witty and well-written - I found the author and her husband, both professional students, to be insufferably elitist and sophomoric. Although they can be justifiably proud of their Harvard education, Martha Beck assumed that the mere mention of Harvard was meant to engender an understanding that they are inoculated from the normal heartaches and challenges of life. In a world packed to the rafters with multiple-degreed professional people, I found the lofty heights in which she fancied herself occupying as a gender studies grad student rather stunning. This exaggerated self- assessement felt like a device that was meant to magnify the lengths in which they traveled to the earth after the birth of their Down Syndrome child. Excluding this annoyance and forgiving the messengers, it it a story of unexpected miracles and well worth your time."
2,Needs an update,I bought this for my sister when she told me she was going to have a commitment ceremony. I was honored when she asked me to be her Maid of Honor. The book isn't bad or anything but it could use some updating. My sister said only some of the information was helpful to her. There aren't many books on the market for this topic though. So if you can't find anythign else it's worth buying.
2,Outdated,"I'm a wedding DJ doing research for some same-sex weddings I have coming up. This book had some helpful stuff about social customs as they may pertain to gay couples. Some of that was helpful and interesting to me. However, it reads quite outdated now (ah, the 90's!) so it feels pretty stuffy. I got a couple of books like this and I would have to say with more choices out there I can't recommend this one."
4,My view on life of Mother Teresa video,I am sure it is a good video but as of yet I have been unable to watch it. I will try to make time soon
1,Horrible!,"This album features one of the wrost performers around. Poor voice, poorly written songs. Get another album. ANY other album!"
2,Not even good enough to get 1 star,"I love horror movies, to get that out of the way. And I will even give thumbs up to a movie even if it has only 10 minutes of goodness for 70 minutes of blah blah (but not ridiculously bad). This movie, Splinter, sucks. It's boring through and through. No real tension and only about 10 seconds of a good part (not worth seeing the movie for).How do I base my star rating? I have friends over to watch horror movies. Last night was my night to pick. I picked this movie. The way my movie group works is that you get to pick until your pick bombs. Because of this movie I don't get to pick for at least another five weeks. I can't even say this movie sucked... it didn't irritate enough. It was just blah, there, boring. So I give this 2 stars b/c movies like The Witch of Pine Barrens (Blair Witch stole this movie) is by far better. And I can't give it 1 star b/c I don't care about it enough to hate it."
5,Surprisingly scary flick,"I had seen the trailer for this movie a while back, but I don't think it made to the theaters, which is a real shame. I caught this on SciFi, and I was very surprised and pleased at how good it was! The writing, acting and effects are all very good, and the film moves along at a brisk pace; even the ""lulls"" are interesting, due to the actors' excellent performances. I've watched horror movies for a long, long time, and it's becoming increasingly rare that a film of this type can offer me a genuine ""jolt"", but this movie does it! An original, creepy film that stayed with me for a while afterwards. I look forward to watching the (presumably) unedited version on DVD."
4,Theory for the Jazz learner.,I purchased this book along with another book by Mark Levine. The books are very similar and both are more advanced than I would have liked. I will need to use this book at a very slow and easy rate.This book will someday be a great help to my dreams of learning to master that Jazz music.
4,Teacher Recommended,This book was recommended by my music teacher to get me aquainted with chord theory. I am a senior but a beginner at the hobby of music and I am finding this book very helpful.
5,Awesome,"There is not much more that I could say that has not been already written, but I want to do whatever I can to promote Mr. Levine's book. Truely Brilliant. Even non-jazz players will appreciate the huge amount of thought and work that must have gone into the creation of this book.Buy It"
4,Great tool for keeping your decanters clean and clear,"This is a great tool for drying your decanters so that you do not end up with any film from water evaporation after rinsing. However, this product works best with a decanter that is symmetrical such as a ships's shape. We have used the dryers with our duck shaped decanters and find that it does not work quite as well."
5,Is what it is!,Yep. 8MM universal fit spark plug wires. Works great and looks good. Does take some time to custom fit and crimp the ends but well worth the time.
4,Why Organics is For You,"Simple recipes is full of ""organic facts""which educates the reader on why organic food is becoming so popular."
5,John Denver's Greatest Hits,"I have this album and play it often. Without question, John Denver is one of the greatest singers of his time."
4,More than just a Talent --,"In the decades of change -- those decades when we grew up, evolved, watched the world around us change -- there was John Denver. And he spoke magnificent vistas of possibility, and the reality of small changes made with love. He spoke caring for eachother, for this planet. He had a wonderful gift --- and he gave generously with his muscianship, and his heart and soul. I believe he spoke to and for my generation as no other has, or will. To say that this man had hate in his heart is not to understand him whatsoever."
3,JOHN DENVER WAS A TELENTED MAN BUT LACKED LOVE TO ALL MAN.,I THINK JOHN DENVER WAS A VERY TALENTED MAN. THIS CD SHOULD TELL ANYONE OF HIS GREAT TALENT. BUT BECAUSE OF THE HATE JOHN DENVER HAD I CANT RECCOMMEND IT. BUT I HALF TO GIVE THE CD 3 STARS.THANKS JACK ELLIS
1,Season 3 but NOT Season 4,"This Blu-Ray set does NOT include Season 4 episodes as described. This is a serious misrepresentation of the product. If you want both season 3 & 4 buy the DVD set instead.The overall quality of what you do get is good but by misrepresenting the contents I am extremely disappointed in this, hence the single star. The fact that this has been pointed out before and it is still described as having both seasons is questionable practice by Amazon."
4,Only Season 3.....,"Watched this on my laptop and found that the disk is only season 3 not 3 and 4 as indicated. As for the video quality, Season 3 was shot back in 2004 and high def had really not taken hold by then. Video is interlaced and quality is what is to be expected for a TV series. Also, several episode have historical footage shot with what appears to be VHS cameras (Aloha Air for example) and those so about 240 lines of resolution....no amount of processing is going to fix that... Go watch other interlaced material like CSI and you will see the same artifacting. There is no 1080p broadcast material.....it is either 720p or 1080i. 1080p is Movie or PC/game console territory....3 stars for being incorrectly advertised..... 5 stars for content. If you want to know exactly what caused these flight and train disasters, you have come to the right place.Are they going to take the time and reincode for 1080p? Obviously not"
5,You would think you were looking at a photograph,This figure is so lifelike. My grandson (age 6) saw this movie and became excited with the Rocky figures. It looks just like Drago and stands up to Rocky (never winning) in the ring.
3,Poorly Printed,"Poorly printed book, cheap see thru paper. Disappointed in the quality for $90.00, not bound well. Content very basic."
4,THA REAL.....HIP HOP HIP HOP!!!,"YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW THIS IS HOT...YOU GOT PEOPLE LIKE MOBB DEEP,OC,COMMON,DEADPREZ,SAUCEMONEY,PART OF THA WU TANG....MUST I GO ON?"
3,Diamonds in the Rough,"The best songs on this soundtrack are ""Against The Grain,"" ""Rare Species,"" ""Won On Won,"" ""Soul In The Hole,"" and ""Your Life."" All true Hip-Hop junkies should make all five a part of their library. I suggest purchasing a used copy of the soundtrack, though, because it really isn't good as a whole."
5,Number One,"These songs go way back to when a catchy hook could have you humming to yourself all day long. You can hear the Phil Spector influence upon Brian in many of these tunes. It seems Brian found his own ""Ronettes"" in ""The Honeys"".... even marrying one, just like Uncle Phil. Definitely worth adding to any collection."
4,Brian Wilson......or Phil Spector?,"Of course these are all songs produced by Brian Wilson mostlyin the early 60's but Phil Spector's influence is all over.Brian has his own ""Crystals or Ronettes"" represented by theHoneys who recorded many songs but never entered the top 100according to Billboard.However there are real Brian Wilson songs as well like thelong sought for ""She Rides With Me, Number One, Fallin' in Love-a beautiful song written by his brother Dennis- Pamela Jean"".I certainly would have given this 5 stars but to my opinionthere are too many songs by the Honeys and others- as mentionedbefore- sound like Phil Spector copies. I understand whyBrian once tought he was goin' crazy thinking Phil was tryingto kill him. He luckily went to create his own genuine stylefrom 1965 on and became one of world's best composers eversince.I was real glad to finally attend his show last year in Julynear Madrid (2005)."
3,Good non-sticky gel,"This held my curls together without feeling overly crunchy. Good of you like the ""wet"" look. Climate control gel will give you a softer hold."
3,Across the Nightingale Floor,"This book is great. It's not from my usual genre and if it had not been recommended to me I wouldn't have read it, but I'm so glad I did. I almost felt like I was there in Japan and I could hardly put the book down."
1,"Remarkably bad - Christainity plus ""life on the down low"" plus...","This book stinks. In fact, the series stinks. I couldn't even finish the third volume even though I'm an anal/compulsive sort.1) Should be one book - at best - huge type w/ huge margins is no excuse for a trilogy.2) Fairly BoRiNg...if you want Japanese, read ""Shogun"" (Clavell).3) Main character seems to live life on the ""down low"" while simultaneously hot for ""perky breasts"". And get this: the addition of a strong Christian sub-line (think ""Narnia""). I'm not sure whether the author is personally confused (and, yes, we all know the Japanese perspective is less judgemental vis a vis sexuality) or whether he threw in the whole kitchen sink so as to increase sales.4) Dog dog dog. Buy Tolkien, Le Guin, Pullman, L'Engle, CS Lewis, or the unappreciated Joy Chant (""Red Moon Black Mountain"")"
4,"From a trumpeters perspective, kind of dissapointing","I got this recording because of the trumpet part of it. This reading uses a more piano-centralized edition of the concerto #1 and so it wasn't quite what I expected. I love the piano, and these two concertos are great and a pleasure to listen to. I was just used to the Timofei Dokshizer recording of the piece where its practically a trumpet concerto and that wasn't what this recording was at all. Still a welcome part of my collection, but trumpeters beware. Find the Dokshizer, it's really really good!"
5,This is a discontinued album,"For a long time I thought I was special to have bought this album to have acquired this album from a friend who saw Sage at a show in 2000. Apparently Amazon has a copy too. It IS a discontinued album and will be very rare in about NOW! Buy this album, it is excellent Sage, not his best but it really gives you a look at his roots. This album is not comparable to Personal Journals, you could probably find the closest comparison in any of the previous ""Sick of-"" installments.This is the fourth album in the Sick of- saga, and although not the best lyrically the best ""listen."" The best track on the CD is Doomage with Slug and Brother Ali. All collaborations on this CD are good, including Sole, George McKibbens, Joe Beats, Jared Paul, and Bernard Dolen.This is a must buy if you're a fan of Sage Francis."
2,Not Playtested for Cut-throats,"Me and my buddies have been gaming for a long, long time and when one of them brought Zombies!!! to my house we figured it would be a good experience.We were wrong.If you play this game with a happy atmosphere and try to not hurt other players too much, it could be entertaining, however, if you are a group of gamers with a back-stabbing tendencies (which me and my buddies are) prepare for a game that has little to no end. Every other turn we were shoving mounds of zombies down the other person's throat. There was little we could do except die and die and die. Teaming up is not an option at all.We played this game for 8 hours making little progress except for flooding the board with more and more zombies (to the point we were actually having to use torn up pieces of paper to represent zombies on squares.Never again, Zombies!!! Never again."
2,very cheap thrills,"Low budget video production with a few ""har hars"" but pretty lame altogether. Poor sound recording."
1,"Five stars for the film, but none for this lousy DVD.","A magnificent film, I love it. Very well done in acting, cinematography, story, etc. This DVD is crappy. It is fullscreen and it is not remastered. A total slap in the face of this classic. Please Disney give this film anamorphic widescreen with 5.1 surround sound and couple extras. If they would do that I would buy it. Until then, avoid this disk."
4,"great family movie, paid way too much for VHS, though...",I didn't realize that it was coming to DVD.I would have definately waited!
5,A classic in its own right,"Natty Gann is well on its way to being a timeless classic for the whole family; its poignantly honest depiction of the Great Depression remains a vivid, rich history lesson in a big painterly style. The main characters are heartfelt without being sappy. Meredith Salenger as Natty is just amazing to watch; she's both feisty tomboy-kid and emerging young woman... her journey is personal, historic and adventurous. Her wolf companion (played by the most wolf-looking dog in the world!) steals every scene, especially as their bond deepens. The gradual friendship between the two is actually believable! All the supporting characters are terrific; fully drawn-out. Having grown up with many earlier Disney live-action films being of a much more saccharine and inauthentic quality, I still am impressed with how ageless of a movie Natty Gann actually is. The direction is stylish, the wilderness scenes are breathtaking and James Horner's music is sweeping. What a well-made movie!"
2,Wear and tear,"I got this chair because I spend a lot of time on front of my home computer and I wanted a roomy chair that would allow me to move around some. I am tall, six feet, but not big, 127 pounds, and I have had this chair for less than six months and the leather is falling apart and the stuffing is coming out of the seat. I don't mind spending money to get a good chair but I cannot afford to be buying two chairs a year at this price."
2,Only worth buying for one reason...,...to see the cameo appearance by Emmy award winning actor Cyndi Lauper. She is not only a great singer but a damn fine actor.
1,Not very credible.,"This episode with its comedy of errors seems like a bit of a stretch even for TV standards. They threw everything at it including the kitchen sink. Okay, we get it, Leslie's friends are not good at high level campaign planning. Let's move on."
2,Not a fan of this episode,"The overt pettiness demonstrated by Leslie, Ben, and Tom in this episode really hampered my ability to enjoy it. They took an otherwise interesting plot and made it too much about the characters interpersonal issues. This is one episode where they should have kept it simple and engaging."
3,"Too much going on, doesn't really come together.","This is a Tom heavy episode. With the potential demise of his entertainment company around the corner, he goes on one of his selfish streaks. There are also sub-stories going on involving the rest of the team but the individual stories really don't come together. This episode has some funny moments but overall you could skip it and not really miss much."
4,Love this show,Amy Poehler makes working in government look worthwhile and fun. Great cast supports every subtle plot and character detail. Love the inside jokes.
3,Not too shabby.,"I am probably in danger of ridicule as a hip-hop head to the bone...but Neptunes surprised the hell out of me. They had mostly been mainstream pop junk but this time it's personal. The tunes are no longer selling themselves out to the industry...wait...they are...I just remembered the ""Pass the Crovosier"" video...P>Anyways, to rephrase, in this album it seems the tunes have kept their best stuff to themselves and the lyrics arent stupid either. No comparison to an Atmosphere, El-P or Gift of Gab...but still...""Provider"" is up there on my top singles list.3 and a half stars...not bad for hip-pop!"
5,One of the best albums of the year,"I purchased this about 6 months ago and i was just baffled about how good it was. I had read some hype on it previous to its release, and it was all true. They just prove that the two of them, Pharrell, and Chad, own the music industry right now. Their creativity at the moment is unparralleled. IF you're considering buying it..do it..it's cheap and it is plain awesome."
4,What was the Amazon reviewer thinking?,"...before I talk about the good there is one bad that I saw. The number one track Lapdance has the same exact sound as the number three track Brain. It just has a different beat to it. That's about the only bad thing. So why did I give the album four stars? Everything else on the album kicks... I can play the whole cd through without stopping. I know an album is good when I can do that. The only song that sounds like beastie boys (which is my favorite group) is Rock Star. It does have that feel to it, but it's ok because it kicks just as much booty as So whatcha want. And this is coming from a big fan. In my opinion they successfully nail the combination of rock, funk, soul, and R&B. They are true pioneers. My favorite tracks are Lapdance, Run to the Sun, Am I High, Rock Star, and Stay Together. I recommend this album to anyone, and the price makes it a no-brainer that you should get the album."
1,Worst CD I've ever heard!! Really dissappointing!!,"If you're expecting hip hop instrumentals or the neptunesstyle of beats with lyrics then look else where. This cd isbad (as in not good). All the tracks sound the same,repetative ""my girl"" theme, and cameo apperances by keli andvita are wasted -used for chorus. But the worst part if youcan stand every track sounding like fabulous's ""Holla backYoung Un"" are the lyrics. The lyrics are simplistic and laughable."
3,"Interesting locale, but the mystery didn't grab me.","I love English mysteries but this one was hard to stay with. I became more involved towards the end, but not enough to give it a good recommendation. I liked the ensight into the royal family and their society, and the ""upstairs, downstairs"" relationships with the servants. I liked the spunky heroine, and the effeminate footman, Davey. However, it was hard to understand some of the British jargon/slang (I'll admit that is my problem, not the author's), and the plot was just not that intriguing."
3,What?,"I don't even remember some of these songs from the movie, and I've seen it several times. Where's the Van Morrison and Artful Dodger? I wouldn't waste my money on this."
3,French Kiss,"You can find Van Morrison's version of ""Someone Like You"" on the French Kiss soundtrack - Meg Ryan/Kevin Klein romantic comedy. This version is not the same!!"
3,Bridget Jone's Diary,"This would be a great movie if it was not so raunchy, a lot of sexual innuendo and swearing I mean enough is enough. The soundtrack however is fun. I did love the story line boy girl boy."
4,I know the mystery song!,"I did some ""research"" and the song playing while Bridget goes through the market is ""Woman Trouble"" by Artful Dodger. It can be found on their album ""It's All About The Stragglers"". They are dance music artists out of the U.K. Why it isn't on the soundtrack is beyond me. I would've liked that better than some of the other songs. Loved Shelby Lynne's ""Killin' Kind"" and ""Dreamsome"" and Gabrielle's ""Out Of Reach"" and the incomparable Robbie Williams! Wish the Van Morrison version of ""Someone Like You"" would've been in..other version is just okay. Otherwise a wonderful CD! Always makes me remember scenes from the movie..love it!"
2,Expect to Be Disappointed,"Be careful, the CD is described as the MUSIC of the Movie, which in part it is. However, it is NOT the SOUNDTRACT of the MOvie. The Artists in the Movie were all original performers, however, this CD has done something I didn't know possible. The CD has substitute original artists (ie Van Morrison )doing their signature songs...it was a real disapointment, especially after seeing the movie, which I loved, and trying immediately to get the soundtract which I also loved, only to discover I ended up getting the Music From The Movie...which is like getting Tang when what you want is Orange Juice....WHY???"
1,Quickly died,"I bought one of these from Target last year and within 6 months, the player door refused to open. The manual does not appear to be anywhere online either. This is a dud - put your money towards a product that will last!"
1,CD's got stuck.,"I liked the size and price of this unit, but it has not been well-behaved. After a couple of months CD's got stuck in the unit and would not come out. You can take it apart and remove the CD, but it will happen again before too long. Look elsewhere for a CD/DVD player."
1,Piece of junk,"This is a total waste of money, do not buy this DVD player. The picture, when it worked, was horrible. It would skip and pixelate, and the picture would go light to dark. Now it won't work at all. I've had it for less than a month, and it will no longer play any discs. I'm very disgusted with this product and will not ever buy another product from TruTech. Spend a little bit more money and buy a better player, in the long run you will save money. I spent $30 on this DVD player and it lasted less than 30 days."
1,Absolute junk,"I bought this DVD player for my dorm room because it seemed like a great deal, and as a college student I obviously have a small budget. However, within a month of my purchase it began to skip, and eventually stopped reading DVD's completely. I suggest you shell out the extra money for a more reliable DVD player or else you will end up buying another DVD player anyways."
4,A in Va,"If you have a teen, this is a must read. Of course no one knows all the answers.But, this if practical, informative and funny.Enjoy!!!!"
2,"Shame on you, Ms. McCullough","No, no, no, no, no!I picked this up with great anticipation. At last, a new novel by a truly gifted writer who has written some wonderful, entertaining books. Unfortunately, The Touch is not among them.Predictable, trite, boring and unbelievable - a futile attempt to recapture the wonder, romance and majesty of The Thornbirds. And it fails on all counts. Reads more like Barbara Cartland than what we have come to expect from one of our major storytellers (all it lacks is Fabio on the cover).Do yourself a favor: if you haven't read Ms. McCullough's earlier works, choose one of them. Tim, An Indecent Obsession, The Ladies of Missalonghi - gripping stories well told. Or re-read The Thornbirds, it's still the best.The lady can write; we all know that. The Touch is just a minor speedbump in an illustrious career. I look forward to Ms. McCullough's next opus and only hope it will live up to the high standards she placed on herself in her earlier works."
1,a question,can anybody tell me how many Episodes in these 4 discs ?can anybody tell me how many Episodes in these 4 discs ?can anybody tell me how many Episodes in these 4 discs ?can anybody tell me how many Episodes in these 4 discs ?can anybody tell me how many Episodes in these 4 discs ?
3,From A Disappointed Fan,"OK, where do I start? First of all, to avoid any confusion, there are 2 different releases of this CD. One of them is the one you are looking at now, and the other one is a limited edition double CD with 12 extra songs, including a MegaMix. Some of the songs from the previous best hits compilations are missing, but that's not the worst part. Almost every song on Celebration is a remix!!! I have nothing against remixes but most of them are much worse than the originals, and they are just painful to listen if you heard the original. This compilation could have been great, but it is just average, therefore it deserves 3 stars in my opinion. If you still want to buy this cd, make sure it is a double CD or you will be missing remixes of the songs like Colors of Life, Radio Gaga, Keep on Dancing, and Take Control."
5,Masculine Landscapes: Walt Whitman and the Homoerotic Text,"AN amazing book that attempts to demystify contemporary society of Whitman's sexual orientation. Fone utilizes Derridadean Theory to present his notion that Whitman may have been using homoeroticism within his writing to convey the messgage that people cannot be put into catagories. Much like Derrida's notion that signs are separate from words, Whitman's text is separate from himself.I definatly reccommend this book to those interested in Whitman's literature as well as all literary works."
3,"a badly needed study of ""Magic Squares""","I have researched Klee's work at the Ryerson Library of Art Institute of Chicago ,this little book is the only book on the subject.The squares were part of the Bauhaus curricula. The only other place you will find any mention of the Magic Squares is in the Will Grohman book."
3,A scholarly attempt at why the Germans failed at occupation.,"I think one of the previous reviewers labeled this a thesis. It reads like a thesis, but this scholarly work answers the question of why the Germans failed at occupation in the Soviet Union during World War II. First they were brutal to the inhabitants, then they relaxed a little, and then decided that what the hell, they might as well create a dead zone. This alienated most of the population to the Nazi cause, as well as provoke a backlash against the occupiers. Then they brutalized the citizens of the occupied areas, which caused them to flock to the Soviet cause.This is a nice read about why the Nazis failed at occupation. Our soldier's officers should read this, as it relates it Afghanistan or Iraq war efforts. Only by understanding the mentality, do we understand clearly what needs to be done."
5,be grateful thier still recording and they still rock!!!!!,"Better than all the new so called rock bands out thier. Not as good as walk on water, but still a more complete album than thier so called classics. Lets face it ufo's best album from thier hayday is strangers in the night a live album that kicks .... and takes names. They never had a complete album with Michael in the 70's and now they got thier first two walk on water and sharks."
3,Nice...But!,I just wish my pants would fit right.I ordered a size according to the company sizing and after 1 wash they seemed to draw up more than usual.I can wear them if I'm walking and standing all day but being a longhaul trucker puts pressure on my gut bouncing down the road all day and I'm not fat just a few pounds over. So I'm pretty unhappy with the whole deal myself.The things are like brand new and I'm not getting any use of them at all.
4,it rocks!,"I have been a ""Pretty Maids"" Fan for a decade and this is certainly one of their great albums. If you like ""Jump the Gun"" you will like this one!"
4,Woolrich Unisex Slipper,"This is a very comfortable, warm slipper. Well made and easy to ""slip on"". It is a bit loose but then, it is a house shoe."
5,Mother Lode is great suspense!,"Mother Lode is a fun movie to watch over and over. I seem to catch more nuances each time I see it. The cast is tremendous, especially Charlton Heston in his dark and menacing primary role. His second character role is haunting in its own way! The suspense lasts start to end in this one! The scenery is stunning. It's a fine movie that is long overdue coming to dvd!!"
4,"""interesting Movie""","For those who like some humor and ........well, if you like Charleston Heston and if you like real out door scenes of real mountains and lakes and such, a pretty good movie. And the vendor.....fast shipping at a great price. Popcorn?"
2,like chuck heston but not in this movie,"i figured anything good ole chuck was in would be good, but this story is just weird. however, it is akin to ole weird Alfred Hitchcock so it just depends upon your taste."
5,Intense Suspense!,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time! In my opinion Mother Lode is as suspenseful as any Hitchcock film out there! The plot is good, the scenery is beautiful, and each actor turns in a superb, convincing performance. The movie made me think that I was actually watching a horrid slice of real life. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD!"
1,Looks so much better in the picture,"I received the Globe Harmony ball today and the only thing that qualifies it as a globe is the fact that it is an orb - it is supposed to look like the earth (including continents) but it is just a smooth round silver ball. I expected the harmony ball to chime but just sounds like a cheap bell like we had on our roller skates as children. For $57.36, I am stunned. I would not recommend anyone purchase this item if they are expecting to receive the item pictured."
4,"""DEEP BLUE"" FINALLY AVAILABLE!","MY REVIEW WOULD'NT BE ANYTHING OTHER REVIEWS HAVE'NT SAID (THE EXTRA DVD WAS EXPENSIVE, HAVE NEW TRACKS ON BOOTLEGS.........)BUT I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A DECENT VERSION OF ""DEEP BLUE"" FOR YEARS. BACK ABOUT 1971 LOCAL SAN ANTONI0 RADIO PLAYED IT LIKED CRAZY. FOR YEARS ALL I'VE HAD IS A WORN 45 WHICH I'VE TRIED TO DIGITALLY RESTORE FOR THE PAST 2 YEARS. BUT NOW IT'S FINALLY ON CD! (TO HIS SURPRISE GEORGE WAS TOLD BY AN INTERVIEWER IT WAS A BIG JUKEBOX HIT IN THE STATES).JUST WANTED ADD MY 2 CENTS."
4,a worthy sequel to All things Must Pass,"I was never able to find it in vinyl back in the days before CD, but then I lived in Puerto Rico at the time...however I found this American pressing of the CD, and fell in love with this album...it is not as long as All Things Must Pass...and it is much better than anything put out by McCartney at the time...sure there are preachy overtones to the songs, but the music is much better than many ""inspirational"" albums by mediocre Christian artists ..""Give Me love"" was a hit...""sue Me Sue You Blues"" gives insight to the Beatle court complications....""Don't Let Me Wait Too Long"" is catchy...the title track is mystical and the trademark sitar is in the background.....""try Some , buy Some"" is an overlooked gem......""Be Here Now""...is another beautiful song....the album is really exquisite, and does age well.....if George ever releases his own anthology it'll be interesting to hear outtakes and alternate versions of these wonderful songs...."
3,"Decent follow up to ""All Things Must Pass""","After the break up of the Beatles, George Harrison wasted little time in releasing his classic double album ""All Things Must Pass"". He followed this phenomenal album with ""Living in the Material World"". If I was rating this album in comparision to ""All Things"", I would probably only give it one and 1/2 or 2 stars. However, comparing it to other pop albums at the time, it is a pretty good effort. The one thing I didn't enjoy about this album is that it is more pop than rock this time around. Phil Spector only co-produced one track on ""Living"", but you can hear his influence on almost every track..."
4,Eastern views on Western problems,"George Harrison / Living in the Material World: This CD has some excellent songs mixed with some merely ok songs. This album reflects his ""Krishna"" philosophy better than any other he had previously released, and he praised the movement just at a time when the American arm of the movement was disintegrating into madness (see ""Monkey on a Stick: Murder, Madness, and the Hare Krishnas"" by John Hubner and Lindsey Gruson). George does speak to John and Paul in the title track in a plea to turn from crass commercialism. The album is actually pretty good, although George sounds rather horse throughout. It is odd at times only because he is speaking from the viewpoint of the far-east, which is often more than foreign to western ears. However, that `foreignness' is also one of the interesting aspects of the album. Four Stars."
3,"Not His Best, But Not Bad","None of George's work can compare to his All Things Must Pass or even his Cloud 9 album. This one is definetly still worth buying though! Anyone who has enjoyed his work in the Beatles and enjoy his Solo work are sure to enjoy this one. There are one or two weak songs, but overall a good piece of work. Give Me Love being one of my favorite songs of all time. Anyone who is a George fan should definetly buy this album! Anyone who doesn't have any of George's solo work definetly start with All Things Must Pass (A very nice, somewhat acoustic, really beutiful work of art) or his Cloud 9 (A more rockier newer feel to it). But how can you go wrong with George Harrison?"
1,Very Disappointing,"Ace is an ace retro release label, but unfortunately this collection is too amateur to rate a ""buy"" rating. I had heard two Jin releases that were great numbers, but not only were they not on the CD, none of the cuts will go into my permanent collection. You have to be a total nut on this type of music to like this collection. Notes were interesting, but the music was not."
3,More than a Touch of Evil,"Simplistic plot. Predictable cardboard characters. Notable acting & impressive effects. Two psychopaths, one merely vicious, his brother, utterly depraved, gun their way to Mexico, taking a faith-lapsed minister and his two children hostage. Across the border, they try to survive the night, beating off vampires at an exotic dance club. Definitely ""Grade B"" horror flick material, but Clooney & Tarantino keep it from sinking to MST3K fodder. Still, it's hard to know whether to root for the vampires or the crooks. Rated R for exposed female anatomy, explicit language & graphic violence--just the thing for the adolescent at heart."
3,from dusk till dawn/full tilt boogie,My review is for the quality of picture and sound...not for the movie itself. Picked this up today just for the movie and not the special features. The sound is slightly off at times from the movement of the mouth. The first 15 minutes or so the motion of the picture also seemed slightly off as well. Don't know if I got a bad copy or if its because they crammed 205 minutes on a standard one sided disk. Glad I only paid 5 bucks.
4,"Not all that bad, tech wise","I may not be a hi-def purist, but I thought for the price ($10 at Best Buy) this wasn't all that bad for a blu-ray disc. No bonus features added (which I wouldn't watch anyway) but to my eyes and equipment this was a decent looking and sounding blu-ray. There are moments when the picture isn't the epitome of high deginition, but these take place in the dark shots of the bar and I would think a good deal of remastering would have to take place to make anything in those shots perfection. Is it really supposed to be? It was shot on film, not digitally. It has a fine film appearance to me. Daylight shots are pretty sharp hi-def in my opinion. Its definitely a step up from the DVD releases of this disc. If you're happy with those, you might not take the plunge for the blu-ray. But if you haven't those, this isn't a terrible place to start at all."
5,"Uhh, HELLO!","This is not a guy movie. Sorry, but this incredibly great exploitation flick is just as much fun for girls. I know, cause hi, I'm a girl. Quentin Tarantino (Who I happen to think is cute, besides being insane and brilliant) wrote and starred in this. Despite the fact that some say he can't act, I think he was very good, clearly enjoying himself (although I'd love to see the parents who spawned both him and george). George (Who i know is hot) is great, also enjoying a juicy role. The rest are awesome. I personally enjoyed the parts without the naked vampires, but that's my girly side showing. The movie, for me, ended when vampire QT went away (his forehead was enormous) but the rest was still very amusing. And another note for those against Tarantino in front of the camera... how can you dislike an actor who's having so much fun? BEST LINES: Juliette: Excuse me... where are you taking us? QT: Mexico J: What's in Mexico? QT: Mexicans"
4,Great campy Hollywood horror,"This movie made me laugh harder than I have in a long time. It is the perfect combination of Hollywood camp and vampire horror. Tarantino is his usual glib self while Clooney is the great-looking tough guy. The addition of Salma Hayek as the snake-dancing leader of the vampires is classic casting, and the smaller appearances by ex-NFL Fred Williamson, Cheech Marin, and other names and faces that you will recognize adds just the right Hollywood flair. With the nudity and violence, this is definitely not a film for youngsters but grownups with a slightly offbeat sense of humor will appreciate the often tongue-in-cheek dialogue and acting."
3,Half the movie is a high-energy thrill ride.,"Vampires are the owners of a seedy bar in Mexico and ALL hell breaks loose when George Clooney and company arrive. That should be the plot, but it takes about an hour for the action to begin. Thankfully, the last 45 minutes are wildly entertaining. I still prefer The Faculty when it comes to genre pics from Robert Rodriguez. Quentin Tarantino's pretty hilarious as an incredibly insane bank robber."
2,Salma Hayek is about the only thing worth watching in movie,"I thought this movie could have been much better. It started out pretty good with George Clooney adding to another overly voilet crime/drama movie. The second half of the movie could have been interesting too but turned gruesome without any reason other than to make the viewer be bombarded with scene after scene of gore. Thank goodness for Salma's brief inclusion in an overwise dismal last hour of pure violence and little to nada storyline. She is beautiful! If you felt foolish for wasting your money on this as a rental, by ALL means, rewind the scene to see the almost magical dance bit with Salma to help forget what horribly unsatisying moments follow!"
3,arrived damaged,"DVD was not fixated in case. Inner spindle was broken.Poor reproduction of original, but @price I purchased for ($4.84)it's acceptable"
5,Great purchase!,My DVD came to me in great shape and very quickly. I am very happy about this purchase.
4,Wild,"This film has almost a cult following...Salma Hayek plays a small but integral part in this movie. She is sexy and superb (on screen and off)...but her dance and interaction with Quentin Taratino's character is not just memorable but the basis for many sexual fantasies. Maybe my favorite scene is in the store when the clerk, on fire, gets up and starts firing at the two while he is nothing but flames...arguably the best gun battle in cinema, thanks Mr. Taratino for writing that into the script. Cheech Marin plays three different characters and while he is not billed at the top he is almost half the movie cast...everyone gets a kick out of Cheech."
5,"(Action,Horror,comedy and suspense)what more can you ask","I though the movie was great.The special effects were great.Not only that,but the story had a brain.And George Clooney was sooo tough and cool while Tarintino was paranoid,and in a way dorky,but hey,he wrote the story and probabley that was his intention.And I got to give props to Robert Rodriquez for the GREAT directing."
1,sucked,"this movie was good for the first 40 minutes....after that it just blew REALLY hard. vampires? come on! i felt like i was watching ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" it had the potential to be a very good movie, but instead pussied out. don't even bother renting this. or option number 2: rent it for the first forty minutes of it, and laugh at the rest."
3,This is PURE Exploitation.,"Quentin Tarantino said it himself: ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is PURE exploitation--no bones about it. If you're not in the ""Fangoria"" crowd, then you'd probably try to stay away. I'm not usually in that crowd either, so I'm giving it a mediocre rating. But, the first half of the movie picks up where ""Pulp Fiction"" left off. Great dialogue throughout the whole movie. Still, if you're not into monster flicks, you're probably better off watching another Tarantino or Elmore Leonard film."
4,This Movie Is The Best One Ever,"This movie was so cool, I was surprised when this movie became amazing and cool. My favorite part of the movie is when Seth and Kate expose the sun to the vampires, that was so cool. I love this movie. From Dusk till Dawn is very amazing because also the vampires it's like growling and snarling. This movie is is the best, better than any other movie."
1,"Only watch the first half, then fast forward the rest","I wish I had read the review of the movie before I watched it because that 'alien vampire' stuff was an absolute joke. I thoroughly enjoyed the first part of the movie and was anticipating a good ending but the director lost interest and obviously got a huge injection of funds because they blew it, what a 'shocker'.My Quenten Tarantino collection is ruined forever."
3,Tarantino Vampire Flick,"Quentin Tarantino directs and also stars in this vampire film. Two men go on a killing spree and go to a bar in Mexico. Everyone at the bar turns into vampires. Also contains a ""making of""/ behind the scenes feature ""Full Tilt Boogie."" Has enough offbeat energy to satisfy most horror fans, and I would recommend it."
1,Could have done without it,"I love vampire movies, I have no problems with blood and gore and can even do without a distinct story line if the movie is at least nice to watch. This one however I could have done without. If you are like me and romanticise vampires, don't watch this one. If you feel you must see it, rent it, don't waste your money."
4,Fantastic Attention to Detail,"I just got my kit last week (they started making them again). I was expecting it to be like the far more dingy models from over a decade ago, but I was surprised by the attention to detail, including the ability to later fit your model with lights. The aztecing decals cover the entire ship, giving the same glowing effect the movies had. You can choose between building the original refit Enterprise, or the variant Enterprise-A by picking a few different pieces.The kit itself is definitely a difficult model to put together without some serious study to understand the interplay of paint, decals, and components. Unlike most model kits, the aztec decals cover the hull and are designed to show through certain types of gloss paints underneath the decal.If you're a model builder or love Star Trek, this model would be a great conversation piece"
1,this movie is CRAP,"Do not buy this film, rent it first. COMPLETE CRAP !!!! Don't waist your money or time. I know most people's expectations will be low, picking up a DVD with the title ZOMBIE HONEYMOON on the cover. However this film is worse then you can imagine. Horid acting, insipid plot (stolen from other films), and humor that fails on all levels. Complete trash."
5,confidentiel,"I bought this album, the record about 17 years ago in Europe.When the vinyl got scratchy I got the cd. I know the whole thing by heart,I still play it, Confidentiel still makes me swoon after all these years. It is a marvelous piece of music. Of course being fluent in french is a bonus to deeply comprehend the feelings he puts into his music. One should learn french just to be able to listen to Jean-Jaques."
4,WOW!!! :),This CD is very Good! My favorite song is Spy Kids (Save the World)!!! I'd recommend this CD to kids of all ages! You should also buy it if you're getting the movie when it comes out!!! ;)
2,Too many people!,"I bought this DVD thinking it would be like other nature/music videos, but it spends a lot of time in the National Parks with people and battlegrounds/statues--yuck. The film is poorly edited--cuts in and out of interesting nature (animal) scenes far too quickly, and they reuse shots. Seems to me if the guy spent so many years making the DVD, he should have had more than enough without having to reuse the same scenery twide. Plus he keeps interrupting between the transitions from park-to-park with shots of himself, talking--saying silly stuff like, ""Sure is quiet out here."" I guess I was looking for something more soothing and relaxing--this is more of a ""tour"" kind of DVD."
5,Excellent book,Great book for anyone wanting to know the ins and outs of LGDs. I couldn't put it down once I got started. Great photos too.
5,Glenn MIller A Legendary Performer,"I bought this after reading the reviews and am thrilled with it. The variety of songs is just terrific, with great varations of some of Glenns regular tunes. The verbal dialog is just one more reason for any Glenn Miller ( or Big Band ) fan to own this magnificent group of recordings."
5,Great Music And History...,"I've had this on record for years, and it's a must on CD! Think of it as an audio scrapbook of important musical dates in the band's career. (First broadcast from the Glen Island Casino, First Chesterfield broadcast,etc.) All wonderful, and the original 2-disks fit nicely onto one CD. Don't toss that vinyl copy, though-packaging here is pretty shoddy, and the booklet is a joke compared to the beautiful original-all the pictures, and about 3/4 of the narrative are missing."
5,The legendary Ethel Merman.,This was Merman's tour-de-force. She is even better in this revival recording than she was in the classic original. A landmark recording.
4,Watch What You Pay,"As a collector of High Standard pistols, the book is both interesting and informative. The original pricing and advertising were both of interest to me. Remembering that the book is a softcover and contains a limited number of pages, I would not pay the high asking prices for used copies. I bought my copy new for $29.95. Avoid any higher price. You're much better off buying Tom Dance's book, High Standard: A Collectors Guide to the Hamden & Hartford Target Pistols. Dance's book clearly remains as the bible of High Standard pistols of that time period."
1,harsh and bright,"Captain Marvel is Marvelous elsewhere, but this was not his decade or medium. The Fusion decade was a disasterous mistake for many Jazz players. Getz could play the notes as well as anyone, strove to show he could play anything, but his sound was ill-suited to Fusion.Columbia, for some unknown reason, took ""The Sound"", arguably the best saxplayer there was and recorded him far too bright. Bright, harsh and bass thin.Getz was having personal problems, health problem and divorce problems in the 70's and they show.Don't get me wrong, I love most Stan Getz stuff. Just trying to save you money! Caveat Emptor. See my list for many better Getz recordings from the 1940's through the 90's."
3,Captain Mundane,"Love some of Getz's work and really dig sides by the supporting cast here. RTF was and is still awesome but this disc just doesn't do it for me. I don't think the players were a good fit for each other. Some claim this is a masterpiece, if so why no Grammy or on the jazz best seller lists like Miles KOB and others. Not my cup of tea and just my opinion. Getz's Anniversay and Serendipity are much better."
2,Sucks,"I'm a fan of the AoE/AoK series. This is neither an extension of those nor an interesting alternative. The look is goofy. The characters are larger than the buildings, the colors are too vibrant. Really quite a let-down. I also have no interest at all in the heroes (and the silly RPG that goes with them) that dominate games like this. In an effort to combine RTS with RPG, you get something not adequate to the best of either. If you liked the AoE/AoK/Conquerors stuff, go to Total War/Medieval. Leave this crap behind and hope the makers return to form with their next effort."
4,AOM...It's up to you,"Is an incredible game if you like the Age Of Empires series...but, you will be bored in 5 days...so...is up to you...<APQ>"
4,"Very good simulation, very fun","A good simulation in the typical build and achieve goals mode. Some fun mythological beasts, soldiers, etc., Gods to pray to. Gives a bit of a history lesson as well."
3,AOE it ain't,"Be clear; it is *not* an extension of Age of Empires. Strategies you might apply there work only half-heartedly here The 'favor' or mythic aspect is fun and interesting, but neither compelling nor extraordinary. Yes, the audio and video are sublime ! However, make sure your machine is up to the task. I had to upgrade a video board (8 to 32MB),just to get it to load. I have an older 400MHz system, but do have 256MB ofRAM. STILL, I have yet to complete a game - it locks up solid, requiring a cold boot and unpredictably. So, if you have a gamer's machine your luck may be better than mine. I still go back to Age of Empires, Conquerors expansion."
5,"Great game, but really hard","Great graphics, wonderful gameplay, but it is really hard to fight. I tried fighting the anubites and the red spearmens, and it so hard. Multiplayer on the internet is really crappy. Halo for PC multiplayer keeps me entertained alot more. You actually know who you are and where your enemy is. Everything else in fun. I recommend you to go out and buy it. It's inexpensive and the campaign is fun if you know what to do that is."
2,I'm getting tired of hearing the same songs!,"I can't think of another artist who has constantly repackaged the same songs over and over again. In June it will be five years since ""Surfacing"" was released and since then Sarah has released a live album and an album of remixes. Both albums feature many of the same songs and now Nettwerk has decided to release ""Angel"" as a single AGAIN! They released it in 1999, probably to promote ""Mirrorball"". I am tired of Sarah releasing the same songs and I urge longtime fans to avoid this."
1,Buyer Beware: carcinogenic sudan 1 colorant,"See http://archive.nics.gov.uk/hss/030801d-hss.htm. for recall by the UK of this and other rajah products; search Sudan 1 to find all brands.You can search further and get the onsite inspection results-- insects and rodents and stuff.The product website now includes disclaimers about ingredients-- so I have no confidence they have removed the Sudan 1.I agree with all the other reviewers-- the best ever tandoori blend. I am hugely disappointed. I was hoping I would find some info that they positively took out the Sudan I, but all I found was a set of disclaimers.I found that Schilling Curry has the same general order of ingredients, does not have the bright orange color, so that is my substitute for now.Rajah Tandoori Masala 100g (3.5oz) - Pack of 2 Tins"
5,Fabulous Masala,Someone gave us the RaJah Tandorri Masala as a present and we used it in a recipe for chicken curry. WOW! We couldn't find it where we live so we bought it on line and it's fantastic - must have it once a week for dinner!
3,Nice case but...,"I saw the ZR camera kit and assumed that my ZR-200 was in the ZR series. So I unpacked it, tried to charge the battery, and realized the battery didn't fit. Come to find out that the fine print doesn't mention the ZR-200 at all. Amazon should really think of renaming this product."
2,Picture is not how it is...,"It seems like a nice product and would have worked great if the shelf itself did not stick out so far. Problem is the glass starts about 5 inches from the wall base. You can turn it, but that makes it start further away as the mount in the middle is not centered.I am not sure why they designed it then way and no pictures I ever saw of it showed it like that. To me, you look at this picture on here and it looks like the glass is right next to the base, this is not the case."
5,Quality and Functional,"This was perfect component shelf I was looking for. There was not other like it on the net. Very well made, quality materials and easy to assemble. I would highly recommend."
4,Works as intended,Good enough for the price. Holds out cable box and the DVD player (stacked) quite nicely. Also blends in well with the black mount and glass top. Would recommend to a friend.
1,don't buy this sucks...,I bought the wall tv mount and this componet shelf together. the tv mount was perfect and this one is sucks.1 the idea is good but the size is wrong. it's too wide for the dvd player and very heave .2 the nails are not working at all. they are not at strong as it should.you can't use it for hang the shelf. you must buy the new one from the hardware store if you want to keep it3 looks dirty and strangeI have to return it and tell anyone----don't buy this sucks!
2,wire storage/concealement feature doesn't work,"the wire storage/concealment feature doesn't work - the cover will not stay on, very flimsy, can't handle even one wire inside."
5,Change of Life Book,"This book was my ""Catcher in the Rye"" because I was a huge Leonard Cohen fan and Suzanne was my mantra.This book meant more to me than almost any thing I had read.I had my kids read it when they were in 6 or 7th grade and they felt the same way.The book still gives me chills.What's happening with Mr. McKay these days?"
1,"Buy ""Como's Golden Records"" instead!","This CD is poor value. Perry's original 1958 album ""Como's Golden Records"" is generally available on CD with 5 additional songs excluding only ""It's Impossible"" ~ a song which doesn't belong on this compilation anyway."
5,First Book I have read by Fanny Deschamps and I will be looking for more by her after reading this,"Picked this up when I couldn't find something by one of my favorite authors, flipped through a couple of pages, decided it was probably readable. Once I started reading, I didn't want to put it down. A bit romantic, but also very accurate on historical era details. Not mushy or predictable."
5,George Duke-Master Of Diversity!,"""Master Of The Game"" is filled with many hard-edged funkymoments such as the latin groove of ""Look What You Find"",theslamming P-Funk of ""Games"" and the elongated ""The Alien""and the Carribean flavored instrumental jam ""Dog Man"".But George Duke mixes it all up too on the Earth,Wind & Fire sounding smooth groove ""Every Little Step I Take"",the dancable,modern R&B of ""I Want You For Myself"" and the commercial-sounding but funpop of ""I Love You More"".A great album,filled with great hooksand loops for modern-day DJ's and samplers and ideal forcasual listening because,as always,Duke always gets the job done!"
4,I really liked it...,"I saw The Start open up for Sugar Ray not long ago. It was the first time that I had ever heard of them. I went out and bought their CD a few days later. I really like their sound. It's different. I like No Doubt, and there are a lot of similarities in their music. The most obvious being that the singer, Aimee Echo, has a voice very much like Gwen Stefani's. If you like No Doubt, then you should check them out. I think that the best songs on the album are Glimmer Man, Shakedown, and Gorgeous."
2,Not high quality,Not a heirloom. Clock is in three major pieces and needs to be screwed together. Wood finish is second rate-joints not flush. Areas of finish were rough. Company needs to buy some sandpaper.Can't rate the inner workings because the clock arrived damaged. Company wouldn't reply to my emails to remedy the problem so I returned the clock. Look elseware if you want a grandfather clock.
4,Author of Survival Meditations for Parents of Teens,"As an author and therapist working with teens and their families for the past twenty years, I am constantly looking for resources for parents. This no-nonsense book can help parents when they are at their most desperate by offering real-life solutions to the problems they most frequently face. For support of a more spiritual nature, check out my daily meditations, as together we try to survive this amazing and challenging time in our lives, and the lives of our teens."
3,Not as good as the other two,"In general this book is a fun reading.But differently from 'Death at Buckingham Palace' and ""Death at Sandringham House', there is a good number of pages in the middle where it becomes very boring. Jane Bee, the heroine, starts to behave extremely stupidly, and the empathy with her goes down the drain. Furthermore, the story starts going round and round.Luckily, later on better plotting and rhythm come back, and the book recovers.'Death at Buckingham Palace', the best of the three in my opinion, has 273 pages. 'Death at Sandringham House' has 370. And this one has 383 - I think it could easily have 70 pages less.I too would like to see a fourth book in the series, but hopefully with more attentive editing. Every writer can profit from the suggestions of a good editor.On a different note, I was appalled at the bad quality of the binding. With just one read, some pages have started to become loose, and the back cover started to tear from the spine."
5,thought it was going to be a silly self-help book but........,"it is an awesome book. I'm even taking notes to use in my life with God. It is not in the least a silly little self-help book. There are strong messages to the believer in Christ. It is funny but the applications are sooooooooo Jesus! You will be challenged beyond your daily walk but with wisdom! This is not about jumping out and running but having permission from Christ to ""jump and walk on the water""!"
5,From the heart,"John Ortberg finds an avenue to everyone's heart with his gift for writing (and speaking). The Willow Creek Church teaching pastor's latest book challenges the reader to an adventure that promises excitement, mystery and reward. In his picture of Peter, as the most courageous and misunderstood of Christ's disciples, Ortberg explains how faith can rock your boat while delivering you from your storm. His gift for making us laugh and cry inside of a few short paragraphs makes this offering a great read for seekers and believers alike."
5,Love it!,"Jon Ortberg has written another great book, I read the book in Romanian but there is now difference form that in English. All the things that the author covers are universally true and they will continue to be true until the end. I recommend reading this book because you will learn a lot of this about Gods calling.Author: Bogdan Alexandru SThoughts across Time"
3,Not for me,"This one was just ok. I had trouble getting into it. Not really my cup of tea, but I am sure there are many people who will love it."
2,Read all the info,"I didn't realize that I was purchasing a miniature book. Good content, but not really what I was expecting. I have enjoyed other books by this author."
5,"If you Want to Walk on Water, you have to get out of the boat",The book was received in a short period from the time of the order. Thank you. The condition was excellent.
3,Nothing really new here.,"After having read books from the likes of Rick Warren, Shelly Rubel, Lee Strobel etc theres's not anything earthshaking or novel here. As well the writing style is tedious and overly long. This book could have communicated the same in half the length that it was. For a more engaging read pick up a book by John Fischer such as ""Fearless Faith""."
5,drawing God outside the lines in crayon,"This book is a beautifully penned guide to inspiration. With wit, humor, and creativity, the author facilitates the reader's thinking to the outside of the box and provides a remedy to spiritual stagnation, that while it takes effort is sweet to swallow and even sweeter in its rewards. Highly recommended to those of us that need a playful kick in the backside to reprise our terk on the path to sipirtual understanding."
2,SMALL BOOK,"Thought the book is good, I was not aware that I was getting one of the TINY books that you can fit in your pocket! I was a little disappointed with that."
3,"Good Selection, Terrible Mastering","This was originally issued as an LP in the 70's with 12 tracks and three more for this CD release. They should not have bothered. They tried to use the Cedar System to reduce the groove noise from the 78 RPM masters and it was a disaster just like that Glenn Miller set. It took the entire top end of sound range clean off and left the music distant and muddy. Too bad they didn't have the guts to go back and do it AGAIN instead of rushing this out the door.Go with ""This is Tommy Dorsey vol. 1"" instead."
4,Go Ideas,I have for many years traved from LA to Seattle and back by car. Thought many of the places given for that area are will know not all of them. In Grants Pass Oragon they give a resterant that I would not even knowen about if it was not for this book and I was great to eat at.
5,Time in a Bottle,I love Jim Croce. It has been years since I have listened to his music. I still have a couple of his vynal albums.
5,Great for the hello kitty lover.,I bought this dryer for my oldest daughter for Christmas she loves hello kitty. The dryer seems very durable and the price was great. You don't find items like this in the store. It has an on/off which is in the center and when you move it up it goes on high and all the way do is the low setting. There is also a button which shoots cold air if it gets too hot.
4,"Good for teaching human learning, but weak for application","As other reviewers have pointed out, papert does a nice job of going through how humans learn and setting up the case that the current education system does not fit our learning process very well. However, this book does little to give teachers specific on how to properly use the computer in the classroom. LOGO, while a useful tool for learning, does not translate well to a classroom setting or for teaching the necessary curriculum."
4,myspace.com/barropanama,"women like men who use snake skin leather belts . lol. this product is descent, the paint makes it a lil sticky. its elegant nonetheless and comfortable. i dunno which type of snake its made of?"
2,For hard core fans only,"This collection does have a few positives going for it. First, Elvis is in fine voice. His phrasing, timing and general performance are good. Also, his backing musicians know gospel music. The remastering is done well.The problem with this set is the material. With the possible exception of ""You'll Never Walk Alone,"" it is all second tier. None of the songs are due repeated listening. The two bonus tracks are a step up, but were not part of the original issue.If you just have to have everything Elvis ever sang, I understand. But there are better disks out there, both secular and gospel by Elvis. Save your money and invest it better elsewhere."
3,not compatible with ipod video!,"i just got this the other day and i love it, except for the fact that i can only use the older model ipod on it and not my video ipod, so it's getting returned and i'm gonna wait for the tunestage II due out next month which will play both!"
1,Chic Flic!,I personally didn't like this movie. Although it had its moments (when it made me chuckle) it really couldn't keep my attention.Thankfully this was my girlfriend's rental and I was able to do something more interesting while it was on such as paying my bills.Next time I'll pick the movie!
3,Enjoyable,That's a nice movie but there is nothing which is creative. It is an enjoyable movie but I have seen better films of Hugh Grant.
3,Hollywood second half,"I almost rated this movie prematurely. Half way through I was LOVING it because I thought I knew what was going to happen and this ""presumed ending"" was so non-traditional that I real expectations. (I know I know most would disagree with me)The ending I had was Hugh somehow getting together with Toni, a not beautiful woman, a woman with problems, a woman with eccentricities etc. but him looking beyond that.But of course Hollywood cannot help itself and along comes the flawlessly beautiful Rachel W. Now if Hugh would have picked TC OVER RW that would have been a real breath of fresh air. I thought the story sort of went down hill after Rachel hits the scene.So the first half is 5 and the second half is 21/2 - 3.Hugh Grant is PERFECT. I wish he made more funny movies. He can pull off such wit.If you liked this movie I recommend Corrina, Corrina"
1,DVD Warning,"The DVD advertises ""hilarious deleted scenes."" Little does the buyer know that these ""deleted scenes"" are actually scenes that were included in the original theatrical release back in May 2002, only to be cut for the DVD version of the movie, and then added to the DVD's ""deleted scenes"" section. Indeed, the number of scenes deleted from the original theatrical release is quite extensive. What a terrible way to screw up an otherwise great movie. Universal should be ashamed."
3,A pleasant diversion,"Nick's books are light fare that touch on heavy subjects, but they work well. Brought to the screen, this story just didn't translate well. The performances are top-notch, and there are plenty of amusing and touching moments. Somehow, though, what plays well in the mind as satire just wasn't remotely realistic when put in my face with Hugh Grant playing an unbelievably shallow and self-absorbed man prior to his eventual rescue. It's easier to suspend disbelief with a novel than a film, perhaps, but as a recent reviewer put it, this is the old cliche of the movie not being as good as the book. I'm glad I rented it, but can't imagine wanting to buy it and see it again and again."
5,Make Your Characters Come to Life,"Nothing breathes life into your characters like good dialogue. Tom Chiarella fully explains the dynamics of good conversation.My favorite chapter is ""Listening, Jotting, Crowding."" Mr. Chiarella gives us permission to eavesdrop!Writing Dialogue also doubles as your own fiction writing workshop. Exercises at the end of each chapter help you apply the techniques.Writers of every experience level can benefit from this book!"
2,Not what I was looking for,"I think this would be useful for some, but not for me. I'm writing a novel based on true historical facts set in a different time period. All the info in here is for something written in today's time, so mostly not applicable to my situation."
1,Clooney is a joke,the man is another joke in Hollywood. He can not act. He would not a good script if he saw one. He gets roles only because of looks and because he can charm his way with the female co-stars. The man is a real toad. Always will be.
2,Not impressive,"I wanted to buy a nice quality bath towel. I think if i went to Wal-mart or Target I would have found much better towels.The color is nice. That's about the only thing. I was expecting it to be fluffier, or thicker. It really feels cheap. And it shed like crazy when i first washed and dried them.That's the downside of shopping online; in the picture it looks great but it's always a risk since you cannot feel it."
5,wicked fun,"Edgar and Ellen are some crazy twins who turn all the pets in their town into freaky exotic animals! This book was fun and creepy and only took me two days to finish. The drawings are awesome (some are a little dark but I like that), and I can't wait for book two."
3,Could Use An Update,"This is a pretty good book, but it really needs to be updated for today's photographer. The images in this book seem like they were old when the book came out. The photography seems like it is from the 1990's and so much has changed since then.The marketing and sales info is still valid today. There are a lot of valuable ideas throughout the bookOverall, the photos would get 1 star and the marketing 5 stars, so I ended up with a 3 star rating."
5,Beautiful honey~,"These were ordered as gifts for gift baskets .. not only was shipping fast, the honey packaging is GORGEOUS! And NEXT time, I'm ordering some for me as well!"
5,HELPFULL,Before I read this book I was always insecure about my sexuality but now that I have read it cover to cover I have managed to get a boyfriend and begin a wonderful and happy relationship. I must urge others to buy this if they had the same problems I did when I was younger.
1,This is music?!,"In all reality, I would love to give this show a rating of 0 stars, but amazon.com won't let me. This is the WORST music I have ever heard in my life! I rented the 1963 video when I found out my drama club was performing it for our spring musical. I now think they have lost all grip on reality! I will be doing tech for this play..."
1,Pretty Bad,"Reads more like the story of a transvestite than a transsexual. The author was clearly rather obsessed with clothes, and much of the book revolves around the various episodes of cross-dressing. I had a real problem with the author's homophobic views (how can a man dressed in a wig and gown dismiss a gay person as ""disgusting?"") and his grossly distorted views of women (his idea of acting like a woman involved getting men to buy him drinks and behaving like ""a silly little thing."") Add to this an affair with a married man, and it makes for an unpleasant read about a rather unpleasant personality. If you're looking for a good transsexual narrative, I highly recommend Christine Jorgensen's book, or Caroline Cossey's, over this sordid tome."
1,Bag of cheap plastic!,"I purchased this as a gift for my nephew for Christmas. When I received the package, it was a bunch of cheap plastic parts in a ripped, clear, plastic bag. There was no label or professional packaging of any type. It literally looks like something you might expect to purchase at a garage sale for $0.50. If you are looking for a Chrismas gift, please keep looking. I am certainly too embarrassed to give this as a gift. Back to the mall for me..."
2,Not a typical Lori Wick book,"This book was not up to par with Lori Wick's previous books. Each of her previous books got better and better, and this one was definitely a lightweight. I had to make myself read the whole book, whereas I could not put down others of hers. She spoiled me after the Kensington Chronicles, the English Garden series, Pretense, Sophie's Heart, Bamboo & Lace, and others. I'm wondering if she might not be spending less time on her books now than before, and she's just writing to get more published."
5,Keeps your feet dry,My feet are always sweating and this and the wash works great to keep them dry.Keeps the fungal infections away although I never had one.
4,"Good, Straight Ahead Steve Earle","I enjoyed this album and the straight ahead aspects of it. The last two albums seemed to be filled with variety just for the variety's sake. This album's heavy songs blend well with the more folky songs later on. The only song that I did not enjoy was Jerusalem. I like political songs, but not when they are wielded with such a heavy hand, like on the song Jerusalem and most of Steve's new album. I'd pick the subtler Copperhead Road, Christmas in Washington, and Taneytown as political songs that I like better."
1,Perhaps CNN is looking for a new anchoperson,"As a long time, huge fan of Steve Earle I was totally disappointed by this CD. Instead of displaying his songwriting talents and extreme skill he has chosen to try and convert me to his ultra American alternate view of America - most of which centers around political attitudes just left of an average night of CNN.A waste of talent and a waste of time."
1,Disappointing,"Steve Earle put out some great records in the last five years, showing himself to be adept at many types and styles of American music from bluegrass to blues to folk to rock and roll. However, ""Jerusalem"" does not even come close to his recent work. Instead, it is overproduced, disjointed, shallow, and depressing. He beats the listener over the head with the political stuff, but doesn't seem to be paying any attention to what really matters: the music. Hopefully, on the next disc, he'll get back to what he does best. Thumbs down on this one."
2,Okay,"Is it me or did the main character spend half the book crying? Jeez. It was an alright book. Basically it was about a woman who was trying to succeed in a company partnered with two men who had very strong opinions about authority. She ends up meeting a one-time hit rap artist who is interested in her. In the mean time, she has an unattentive fiancee and another ex-fiancee that she hasn't quite gotten over. Three men circle her love life in different ways and her mother may have cancer too. When it rains, it pours. The rap artist was an interesting guy, and I was more interested in him and his history with her two male co-workers than I was with her. She spent too much time crying and cheating for me. After awhile, I was just bored with her."
4,Not their best.....,"Need some cliff-notes on the natures of Cthulhu or Azathoth? Got a corpse lying around that you need to animate and torture forbidden secrets from? On the lookout for a good curse or incantation? Then, this album is for you.With that said, if you're like me and bought this for the music, then you might not be blown away. Granted, the production is first-rate, the musicianship is top-notch, and the lyrics are *beautiful*; but, song hooks that are more prevalent in earlier Nile albums are few and far in between on this one. Even the more memorable tracks, such as As He Creates.... and Even the Gods Must Die.... leave a tepid feeling at best.The bottom line? If you're a dyed-in-the-mummy-wrappings Nile fan with every album and in the pit every time the band comes to town, buy it. If you're looking to get into Nile, I'd recommend going with one of their earlier albums, such as Amongst the Catacombs of Nephren-Ka."
3,Not for me,"I had high hopes for this bra with all the rave reviews but I don't like it at all. The shoulder straps are just way too short for me (I'm 5'9). I've never, ever had a problem with straps being too short with any other bra as you can always expand it more to fit. But even at full expansion the straps are just way too short for me and therefore cause the bra to ride up and causes discomfort on my breasts, something you don't want while nursing! I'll keep looking for the perfect bra for me, so far I can't find it!"
3,"Difficult to read, not a primer. Good to get certified","Many JAVA books fall into one of two categories. 1) Not complete or ""real world"" enough, or 2) Written for computer scientists. This book definitely falls in the second category. If Khalid actually speaks during a lecture like this: ""Precedence and associativity rules are necessary for deterministic evaluation of expressions"", pity the poor students. Also the author, continually refers to sections far ahead of the page you're currently reading.However, when you're finished with this very detailed book, you should be able to pass the Java Programmer Certification. The completeness, and the abundance of review questions and program examples are why I giving this book three stars."
5,Very easy to read,"Great book whether you are studying for the exam, or whether you just want to learn more about Java concepts. I wouldn't say this book is for beginning programmers, but if you have experience programming in other OO languages, you'll have a relatively easy time getting through this book."
1,Not Original Work,"The content is accurate, but so much of this book seems to be taken, with superficial changes, from the Roberts/Heller/Ernest book. A lot of the chapter titles are identical, and the organization by objective is nearly the same. The content is often very close, just presented in a different order. Some diagrams are almost straight-ahead copies. If I pay good money for a book, I want original work, not a copy of something someone else wrote."
1,Hard to read. . .,I have tried hard to go through this book twice. I was disappointed about its writing each time. I would consider that is a torture to myself to finish reading this book. Not even mentioning I still have to pass the exam. . .The good thing about this book is its exam questions. They are well-designed questions and can test your understaning.
2,Pitiful Auto-Fire Feature,"This PC game controller has a lot going for it; low price, convenient retractable cable, USB plug, vibration motors, turbo fire for any button...all good features. But it also has a lot going against it; the worst of which is it's turbo-fire feature. The turbo function is woefully inept - it doesn't repeat nearly fast enough. It's almost as if the turbo fire only repeats intermittently. This game pad is totally unacceptable for games on your PC requiring keeping your finger on the button using auto-fire.Other problems include your PC forgetting the pad's plugged in whenever you retract or extend the cable. That shouldn't have anything to do with the controller's connection! Also, the digital thumb pad feels cheap...a common problem with game controllers.I know there's a drought of dependable PC game pads with turbo fire, but purchasing this one for it's auto-fire merits would be a mistake."
1,Melusine: A Myestery Review,"It is a hard to read book for children going into 4th grade. It it`s not that great because of swearing, and other innapropiate things. Sorry but I think this book is badnews!"
3,Steppin,It was ok. Turns out I'm not as big a fan of the Pointer Sisters as I thought I was. I like their hits but the rest of their music leaves me luke warm.Steppin'
4,Very good book.,"I was so impressed with this book that I rearranged the content of my children's church so that I could include a story from it! A lot of the stories require so many materials that you have to go shopping in order to do them, however, most materials can be used with other stories later. I hesitated buying this book because I thought it would require a lot of craftiness or dressing up that I wouldn't be able to pull off, but it's all pretty simple to do. It's a good way to bring the Bible to life with grade school kids."
5,Pure Coffee Sophistication,"The double walled glasses keep the espresso warm and just look so amazingly sleek. If you don't have an espresso shot glass at all, I'd recommend one for any espresso machine. There are cheaper ones out there, but I appreciate the style of the bodums and the fact that it does keep the espresso warmer."
1,"Liked them at first, and then they broke...",These probably shouldn't claim to be dishwasher safe. That is most likely where they broke. One somehow broke entirely and the other had cracks throughout the entire glass. Kinda cheap. There's really no point in buying these.
1,Too Bad - Poor Performance/Too Delicate,"These sounded like a wonderful solution to 'sweating' glasses, and also to keeping drinks cold longer. Regrettably, they were just too delicate for words. We always babied them, having read some of the negative reviews. We gently hand-washed and hand-dried with fine cotton dishtowels, and always put ice in gently, by hand, cube by cube (never held one under the fridge's ice dispenser). Now, two have broken on the INSIDE, after we had been sitting with them awhile -- which could have been dangerous! Had we not noticed, one of us could have swallowed some broken glass. Very disappointed."
1,"Buyer beware, these fill with water!","I bought four of these, and loved the way they looked--BEFORE I washed them. There is a very small hole on the bottom of every glass, left over from the glass blowing process I presume. Water seeps *INTO* the glasses through this hole and fills the inside of the glass with dirty dishwater--not a good look. I've washed them by hand and ran them through the dishwasher, problem persists. Not only is it gross, but since the hole is on the bottom, when you set the glasses down they slowly leak! I found this out AFTER one had been placed on the wooden shelf of my bar. Too bad this fundamental flaw--so easily fixed--was overlooked by a company so proud of its design."
3,love the concept but too delicate,"these glasses do exactly what they are supposed to; hot liquid stays hot, cold liquid stays cold & keeps condensation off the table top. Unfortunately i was misled into thinking these were durable glasses by the description that they were made out of ""beaker glass."" one of the two i received in the mail came broken & i broke the other one within a day. if you can keep from breaking them, they are pretty cool."
3,Glass expresso shot glasses,"One must be careful not to remove the small rubber tab on the bottom of the glass, which might be confused with a label. It actually serves to cover up a tiny hole that allows air and moisture into the thermal wall."
5,Gorgeous & Functional Glasses,Just ordered another set. The only glasses I use for cold or hot beverages. I also have the smaller size for tea and coffee. They are not only gorgeous but they do exactly as described. If you take care of them they will last & last-had mine for over a year and they are as good as new. One was broken in the last order but Amazon promply replaced the order. It's nice to know that Amazon takes care of their customers.
3,Sadly too breakable,"A lovely light glass to drink coffee or tea. I am a tea enthusiast and love my tea piping hot. To drink it our of this delightful glass was perfect, it kept the tea hot and the aesthetic of seeing the gold through the glass walls added to the experience. Until our family broke two out of the three we just purchased I was content. However, one broke when it fell two feet onto a wood floor, another broke when it was placed, not dropped, just placed onto our concrete countertop. Yes, our family breaks things no doubt. But these were so fragile they need to be owned by perhaps those who live alone or with a partner who is equally delicate. I look forward to when Bodum makes these in a more shatterproof glass! And if they could make them a bit larger, 10oz, that would really fit the bill."
5,excellent glasses,"I found these glasses to be very lightweight, and as advertised, they do not sweat because the are a glass within a glass!"
3,feels a little plasticky,"Feels a little plasticky to hold because of the air between the double walls. Otherwise, does an ok job. Looks mediocre"
4,Nice glasses,"I bought the Pavina 2oz glasses for my girlfriend and they're just fine. I really like that I can see the espresso and creme after I brew my shots.I got her the Pavina's after having owned the Assam 2oz glasses for quite a while. At the time I was hesitant to buy them because of all the bad reviews about how fragile they are. Maybe I've been fortunate and I am careful with them, but they don't seem to be as fragile as some claim. They arrived intact and I even banged them on the granite counter-top harder than I liked a couple of times, as well as having them banged against other dishes: so far so good."
3,It's changed,I absolutely love these glasses! However I did break a couple of them and ordered more but when the arrived it looked like there was a rubber sticker on the bottom which I immediately removed only to find a note in the box telling me not to remove it! Well it turns out that these glasses are now being made with a small hole in the bottom and the rubber piece covers it. Now my glasses are ruined because when I wash them in the dishwasher dirty water gets inside the insulated area that doesn't come out without a lot of shaking and wicking with a paper towel but leaves the glass dirty. I'm not sure why they changed how they make their glasses but to me the rubber patch on the bottom takes away from the beauty and enjoyment of these beautiful glasses.
3,It's ok,"I bought this cup for my husband, and they're good drinking cups. The problem I have with them is the same that a lot of other reviewers have expressed- they will shatter in an instant if you're not careful. They are very delicate, and you have to treat them really delicately when you're handling or washing them. I still keep buying them, because my husband really likes them for his coffee in the morning, but I broke a fair number of them - 6 to 8- before I learned how to treat them. As long as you know this going in, it's fine. I haven't broken one since this purchase, so I guess I've learned."
5,"work great, no problems","i bought these getting ready for summer, they work as advertised. keeps your drink cool and no sweating. great product!"
2,Hi Ball Glasses,I purchased these glasses for serving cocktails on our patio because they do not sweat or leave rings on the table. These last 4 glasses I purchased do sweat and do leave rings on the tables. I will purchase locally next time so that if they sweat I can return them easier.
2,Be VERY VERY Careful,"Not sure what I'm doing wrong..but my Bodum glasses tend to break very easily. Most recently, I was handwashing an 8.5 oz tumbler and it just broke in my hand...causing quite a nasty cut. I tend to be very careful with my glassware and never place these glasses in the dishwasher BUT this is the third one to break. Love the design and the insulation properties but will never purchase any more....they are far too delicate.."
4,Disappointing new version,"Just purchased a pair of these, hoping for the solid build of the old ones Pavina glasses that we have. Found that these are not pure glass but have a hole in the bottom, sealed with silicone which is clearly liable to fall off. The packaging claims this silicone somehow helps with ""venting"", but there was nothing wrong with the old version. My guess is that this is a classic case of cutting manufacturing costs and then trying to convince consumers that you are making an improvement. Total disappointment. I'm glad I only bought one pair, and I won't be buying more of these.Update on 2012-08-21:Fair is fair. I worried that the silicone seal would fall off, after a year and a half of almost daily use it's still holding up without any problems. So I'm upping this review to four stars."
5,We love these glasses,We first found out about these glasses when we were served cappuccino in them in a fancy restaurant in Montreal and we really liked them. We went home and found them on the web and ordered them right away. We use them for coffee in the morning and have also used them for beer. They are wonderful. They keep the coffee hot and the beer cold. They feel really nice to the touch as well and are not hot to the touch even with piping hot drinks in them.
4,Nice Glasses,"The primary reason I like these is because I don't have to use coasters! They truly are insulated, and after several uses, they haven't had a drop of condensation on the outside. Also, I do like the fact that they're so lightweight that they feel kind of like air in my hands.The primary reasons I won't buy any more are one,because of the price, and two, because I have to be too careful with them. The are fine in the dishwasher, but when I'm using one, I'm always afraid I'm going to drop it and lose what I consider to be a considerable financial investment.When all four of my Bodums break, that's the end for me, unless they've gone way down in price by that time."
3,Very fragile.,"While the glass does stay cool, the glass breaks if it so much as bumps against something. Otherwise good."
5,They've been great,"I think it's been more than a year and I still have both, they're perfect and I have nothing more to add."
5,these are great!,We love these espresso glasses so much! They are definitely worth the price (i wouldn't pay more though) and they are so beautiful.
4,"Bodum Pavina 2,5-Ounce Double-Wall Thermo Glasses","These Espresso Shot glasses are a big hit at my house. They look cool, feel awesome and keep the espresso hot for a longer period of time than standard glass or ceramic shot glasses. The reason that I took off one star is because unlike the original version, as another reviewer has noted, they have a small hole at the base of the glass that is covered with silicone. That has me worried as to their longevity. Time will tell and I will update after I have had them for a while."
2,Nice but Broke Already,"These cups look nice and was loving them until one slipped in the sink and shattered. I managed to go on only loving my one remaining cup until today, when I found the inner space of the cup filled with dish water and not the factory installed ""space""."
3,Possible counterfeit or seconds?,"This is my 3rd set of Bodum glasses (not all from Amazon) but the first pair that might be a counterfeit:- Brochure poorly printed and moldy- Incorrect logo placement & colorTo Amazon's credit, they are shipping a replacement set out immediately.I'm rating this an averaged 3, 0 for the original suspect set and 5 for the replacement (assuming it's first quality)."
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap",I bought 4 sets of Bodum glasses -- several different sizes. They are SOOOO cheap I can't believe it. I've only had them a couple of months and already they are developing cracks in their walls so that water gets in between the two layers.These glasses cost a lot and are SO not worth it. Never again. Buyer beware.
1,You will not be pleased,"When a liquid sips through the double wall, I don't know how it happens, there isn't a way to get it out and afterwards the glass look terrible. So, I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. The reason why I gave it a one star is for its initial look; that is, before a liquid infiltrate the double wall. Once that happens, I don't know even if it wouldd be healthy to use the glass in such condition."
4,Smaller than I thought; nicer than I expected,"I saw this as a Gold Box option, and became intrigued. I searched out the various Bodum sizes, styles, and chose on the Pavina, 9 oz. It's the perfect size for the hand to hold, and the cocktails (what I use it for) stays colder; no glass ""sweat."" However, I guess I'm just used to Old Fashion cocktail glasses that hold more liquid. The glass does NOT feel as delicate as other reviewers stated. Actually, the rim is thick, and at first it appeared to be plastic (for durability, I'm sure). It's a very unique looking glass, and I like it."
1,Beware,My wife sprayed this glass in our sink with a sink sprayer and it exploded. A large shard of glass landed on our countertop while the rest sprayed in a fine glassy dust several feet in all directions. Both the spray water and glass were at room temp. when this happened. Called the seller (not Amazon) to complain and they told me to call Bodum. I called and told them what happened and they simply offered a free replacement.
4,Love them,"I really like these. They are very cute, and great for coffee. It's really nice to see the different shades of coffee in them. I didn't give them the full 5 stars because I found them hard to keep clean/streak free."
4,It's almost excellent because...,"I like the Bodum glass line. I bought them because I have a Rancilio Silvia and needed something able not to destroy my crema and preserve it. The convex bottom makes it perfect when the espresso is being extracted. I love that you don't need to preheat the glass and also it keeps the espresso warm.CONS:Just one...When you pour your espresso or any liquid from your pavina glass, the liquid will travel all around the exterior to the bottom due to the curved edge.THE SOLUTION: Pour it fast and don't try to divide the liquid amounts 50-50, because you won't be able to do it slowly.And lastly, they look perfect!!!"
1,Makes a HUGE mess,"This is a truly horrible product. When you turn the handle, it moves the wire inside, which flicks the flour right out of the container- every time! It doesn't matter how slow I go or how much flour I put in the container. It ends up making a HUGE mess! I sometimes put the flour in and just shake it so it goes through the mesh. But, I could have used my strainer to do that."
5,OLD TIME SIFTER,LOVE THIS PRODUCT . MY SIFTER THAT BELONGED TO MY GREAT GRAND MOTHER BROKE. THIS SIFTER WORKS JUST LIKE MY OLD ONE LOVE IT !!!!
3,Bad,"I'm not really happy with this product. When I crank it, unless I do it in a particular way, flour shoots up and out everywhere, coating everyone. It doesn't crank easily, either- not smooth. I was really hoping for a smoother turn and more even flour distribution, not unsifted flour spewing out. Also it doesn't wash easily."
2,DISAPPOINTED,My husband is the sole user. On day three of its arrival he inserted checks with the tab from the check book. It jammed and has not worked properly.The helpline suggested using shredder oil.
2,"Product Good, But Price - Buy Elsewhere",Who is Amazon trying to take advantage of? CVS sells this product for $9.29 each. Drugstore.com sells the product for $7.99 each. This means for the privilege of doing business with Amazon you get pay an approximate premium of $38.00. Do not waste your money on this one buying from Amazon. Go to Drugstore.com and get a competitive price.
3,Get The Original Cast Instead,"This isn't a bad recording of arguably the greatest score a Broadway musical ever had; it has generally good conducting and performances. But except for the brief contributions from the great Carol Brice, there are no standout performances, certainly nothing to compare with the memorable Ella Logan and David Wayne on the original 1947 cast recording (on Columbia). And despite the fact that the original cast recording originally came out on 78s, it isn't all that much less complete than this recording from the LP era--the only major addition in the 1960 recording is a brief reprise of ""Something Sort of Grandish."" So unless you must have stereo (and the 1947 sound of the original cast recording is fine), go for the Columbia version. And get it NOW. This score is desert-island stuff."
3,Brigadoon CD,"Seems a bit old fashioned musically, but it's an old original so reflects those times....."
5,Must read,This is a complete work and good reference. I loved reading it because it separated the men from the women. You can see who did great things and who did more naughty things in the Bible.
2,Not as bad as Lommel's version but still a stinker,"I mistakenly thought this was the new version by Ramzi Abed...but realized after five minutes I was wrong. Acting is pretty bad and effects laughable, but not gross like the Lommel piece.Still not great. Even DePalma's version was less than expected. To date, the best Black Dahlia movie was the television film starring Lucie Arnaz in the late 70's. Now, that was a great one, if you can find it."
2,I wonder how good it works,"I recently received my new A/V transmitter and receiver yesterday. They look very nice....well built. There was NO POWER SUPPLY with the units, only two power supply cords with bare wire on the ends. I am now going to have to buy two 12 volt dc power supplies before I can even test the units out. I wish they had told me so that I could have ordered them at the same time."
4,Very Good Unit for the Size,"If you buy this unit, realize that it is a 5,000 BTU unit and only has enough cooling ability for small rooms. That being said, so long as you use it appropriately, it is a very good unit. The only reason I gave it 4-stars is because I have to leave the thermostat at nearly 7 (Max) to keep the room around 70-72 degrees F; if I turn it down to 6 or between 6 & 7, the room gets up to at least 75 degrees F before the compressor turns back on, which I don't want. Seems the thermostat is calibrated for a higher temperature range than I would prefer."
2,Not very cool.,"This air conditioner worked okay. It made my room bearable last summer, but not what I'd call comfortable. My roommate's air conditioner worked much better. It didn't seem to be very efficient, and the accordion panes that came with it to cover the rest of the window opening felt very flimsy and drafty. The immediate area around the air conditioner seemed like it cooled alright, but I lived in a pretty small room, and it didn't seem like it made much of a difference, even after running for a few hours. Sometimes it felt like it was just acting as a fan - the air coming out didn't always seem significantly cooler than the air outside."
3,Hard to finish,This was a hard one for me. It was hard to get involved; I never really connected with the characters although I had to finish it to find out what happend.
1,Not as good as it sounds!,"I was disapointed before I even started to read this book. First of all, the pictures are black and white so you really can't even begin to understand the beauty of these wonderful anamals. Second, and most suprising of all, a good half of the dogs featured in this book are not even CLOSE to rare. As a matter of fact, most all of the breeds can be bought at a local pet shop. Lastly, the breed discriptions are marginal at best. The breed standards are way off and most of the text is babbling commentary rather than usefull information. You would get better information from a part-time pet shop clerk than this book. I may not be an author but I think a better title for this book would be, ""Blah Blah Blah, Dogs, Blah Blah""."
2,Didn't work for me.....,"Sorry to say, this Shoe Horn didn't work for me. I receive it as a gift, and was so glad to be able to put on shoes with ease. The first time I use it, the ""flex-handle"" came off. Easy to screw back on, but during use, it pops off every single time. For me, I had to order a wooden shoe horn that was solid."
4,Standard tube,Had good results from most other Sunlite products. Ran this tube in tires on recent tour. Fits wheel correctly without slack. Valve stem appears to be good quality. No flats at this point...this is not more than a standard tube and I don't expect greater than usual flat resistance.
5,Great Book!,"I have read one other Holt book, Secret for a Nightingale, and found it was one of the best books I have ever read! I went to a book store, much to my dissapointment, was told that her books were ""outdated"". I searched until I found this book. It was so captivating that I read it in two nights! I am still searching for more of her books. I'd reccomend any of her books to anyone."
3,I like it,"It gets the job done, although i wish the bristles weren't so flimsy as i sometimes have a harder time teasing my thick hair. Otherwise it works pretty well."
2,Doesn't Work,There is something wrong with the bristles -- they don't hold the hair well & the brush is useless for teasing.
4,Beautiful Table Although Did Not Assemble Perfectly,"This is a fabulous, space-saving coffee table. It was packaged well and arrived in perfect condition. The table was quick and easy to assemble. My only issue was that the spindle (barely visible in the above pic) did not tighten properly and, therefore, the wooden plugs would not secure themselves into the wooden leg assemblies. This left the hardware slightly exposed. Not a huge issue."
5,gotta love this,it is the very best in its class. I have tried all the others and after a little research this one did it all.
4,great toy for sandbox scavenger hunt/puzzle,"This was great for my 5 yr. old daughtres bday party, she's into it! and after it casted (easy out too) colored it, then coated with sealer, she uses in sandbox for scavenger hunts, and as a puzzle - just don't get it wet or it will deteriorate! Can also make more with extra plaster of paris (party give-aways to take home & decorate with paint)"
4,They've come back with a new name,"Nevermind the amazon review of this album, they've always sounded great, not fragmented, and they are fabulous live! This is a talented gang of musicians with no boundaries. My only comment is that this album feels more 'manufactured' than the previous 3 and a little less fresh. Despite this, I highly recommend this album, especially for the name track!"
2,Frightfully Disappointing,"Let me start by saying I really love Afro Celt Sound System. My father introduced me to their first CD and now I'm more rapid about getting their new stuff than he is... Or anyway, I was.The first two CD's were nothing short of relevatory for me, and the third seems to go in a different direction, but is still quite good.Sadly, I feel like unlike Paul Mounsey (Nahoo, et al) Afro Celt doesn't seem to be aging well. I couldn't help but feel that Seed was very, very derivative and washed out compared to their other offerings. The same sort of over-produced sensation I get from Vanilla Pop rubbish on the radio.I realize this is pretty harsh criticism of a group whose first 3 CDs retain an honored position in my CD case, but I just feel Seed isn't up to snuff. They can and have done much, much better."
3,What Happened?,"Afro Celts previous volume of work showcased everything that was good about this band. With ""Seed"" it seems they've stepped back to their debut where I felt there weren't memorable melodies and song structures. There wasn't a single track on ""Seed"" that I could remember after repeated listening. So what's the point? I was left with a feeling of partial satisfaction. I mean this disc isn't bad, but it's just average compared to their two previous works. Obviously, I must be in the minority compared to the other reviewers here who seemed to love this. I'd say check out Afro Celt Sound System's ""Volume 3: Further In Time"" before looking into ""Seed""."
3,Brief flights of fancy,"Volume 4 from the electronic, world fusion outfit walks a precarious line between it's amazingly fluid, fast-paced multi-instrumental joys from the past and a more regimented, standardized pulse consuming some of these growingly stereotypical, vocal-laden compositions. Their formula for success might have been a bit more exciting when it was fresh, but at this point the former Sound System still had at least a certain amount of integrity intact. As conceptual overkill begins to wear on producers, soloists still nail impressively diverse sequences in satisfying measures."
1,awful covers,These are not worth purchasing. Our friends purchased some and were delighted at first. We bought cover's. After the first storm the covers were ripped in several places. i contacted our friends who said they too were disappointed because they rip easily. Never again..Les
5,The Rembrandts are Back,"After more than a five-year hiatus, Danny Wilde and Phil Solem have reunited in an album that outdoes their L.P. and matches both Untilted and The Rembrandts. ""St. Paul,"" ""Lost Together,"" ""One of Us,"" and ""Happiness"" are amazingly vibrant and catchy melodies that deserve radio play. I'm eagerly awaiting the tour in 2002. If your only familiarity with The Rembrandts is from the overplayed Friends' theme song, here's your chance to experience Solem and Wilde at their best."
5,Ready for More Rocking Out?,"Picked up my Guitar Hero II yesterday and was very pleased to see it delivered all the qualities of the first game and beyond! The co-operative two player mode is a lot of fun, allowing two people to work together on a song. After weeks of struggling with medium mode songs on the first game, I found I'm flying through the easy songs on II with near perfection. Gotta love getting 100% score on ""Shout At the Devil"" the first time playing the new game.If you love music, if you love Guitar Heros I, this is a game for you."
4,Great game!!,"It is a great game, I find myself sitting for hours playing this game. And I don't even like video games that much/.....could have more songs though"
4,its so much fun but i cant do some things on it,"i was plaing with it for a while then after the second day the bar thingy that u go up and down with for long holds broke,it didnt brake off it just mkinda is stuck and it wont do it anymore,so i think that sux...but the game is so much fun,the best game i own!!"
1,best review ever,"How could I possibly review a game I have not received??!!!! I have tried to contact anyone who may have info, to no avail. It has been over 40 days since the order was placed, is there no follow up anywhere? Or is it take the money and run?! Furthermore, wouldn't it make sense for amazon to check on the status of an order before contacting me - for - of all things - A REVIEW? Insulting. I did quite a bit of shopping with amazon this year, and it will be my last. Now let's see if a human actually reads this."
5,GUITAR HERO FRENZY,"Everyone in our house is crazy for this video game. It was supposed to be birthday present for my son's 12th, but my wife is now hooked on it too and competes with him for playing time along with my other two kids!!!"
5,Extrordinary,"Guitar hero two is an extrordinary game that features stunning sound and beautiful graphics set to the rock star life. The game lets you play as a rockstar on tour. Rocking out in neumerous venues, and jaming to over 60 new tracks. All aroung this game gets 5 stars. there is nothing that measures up to it on the market."
2,Fun for a time,"As with all the games, gets boring really quickly. On a separate note, be sure to read the fine print in the product description-mine was only the guitar, which I did not realize until I noticed the seller description saying ""guitar only"""
1,Not worth the money,"I know other people like this product, but it leaves my curls feeling VERY crunchy/crispy. I've even tried using less and less amounts of the product each time, but it still leaves the wet/crunchy look.Considering the VERY expensive price tag, it is not worth your money.I use a gel by Redken that leaves my curls feeling soft and natural and takes care of the humidity factor just fine."
4,for wavy curls,"The product was processed and shipped very quickly. This is my 1st time using Quidad products. I originally followed their directions for styling, but found that my hair type needs a be worked with a little differently. When I went back to my old styling method, it worked a lot better. It is a great product to keep the curls soft. However, I still needed to use another product with it to ensure a stronger hold as I have some curls that become more like waves by the end of the day."
3,This is not for all types of curly hair,"I have curly hair but it's not super thick. Yet, it still gets really frizzy with the slightlest humidity. I gave this product a try at the suggestion of a stylist at the Ouidad salon in NYC. But it's just too heavy for my hair. I give it three stars because it did keep my hair frizz-free, but I hated the way it made my hair look. It was really weighed down and looked flat. It also had this funny unnatural look to it - like each curl was coated in plastic or something. I gave it to a friend with much thicker curly hair and she loved it. We both felt it left our hair ""crunchy"", so I would say that you need a pomade or some other finishing product to get the crunch out after the gel dries (I like my curls to look soft so I use a pomade with almost every gel). If you have really thick curly hair, I'd say give this a try. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
1,Don't buy not worth your money,"I have extremely thick & curly hair. After reading so many of the great reviews, I bought this product and used it exactly as instructed with very poor results. In fact, my regular VO5 moose and Redken hair lotion worked 10 times better than this product. My hair was left dry and curls frizzy after using Ouidad. Maybe it works for thinner curly hair, but very thick hispanic hair this product does not live up to its promise."
4,Literary yet sexy!,"We really enjoyed listening to this on a recent roadtrip, and it got us surprisingly amorous! We pulled over at a couple reststops to better concentrate on our interpretation of this literary erotic feast. Very fun. Highly recommended."
4,Quite good later Elvis,"These 1976 recordings, along with the companion album MOODY BLUE, were Elvis's last studio recordings. This album was released in 1976 and MOODY BLUE in 1977, but all the studio tracks on both are from 1976. As with most of his 1970s studio work, the emphasis here is on country music. Considering his shaky health in 1976, Elvis sings with surprising conviction and vigor in the mostly-sad lyrics of these songs. My personal favorite is the epic ""The Last Farewell,"" a wistful Roger Whittaker song about a man headed to war in England. Arrangements of the instrumentals and background vocalists are good, too - I disagree with those who find the arrangements on his mid-70s albums too lush and intrusive, though on some specific songs I do agree. Though overall this album and MOODY BLUE are quite good, be forewarned that Elvis's declining health usually shows through clearly in his voice on this album."
2,Too thick.,"I really like this belt, but it's too thick to fit through the belt loops on any of my pants, jeans, etc. I have to wear it on my hips if I wear it at all. I actually wish I hadn't bought it."
2,REALLY used,When I got the book the cover was almost tore off. Pages were badly yellowed and it even FELT dirty.
4,Bringing the sunshine back again!!!,"I purchased this C.D. the first day it was out, I went to Wal-Mart before the store even opened It's doors! I literally ran to the music section and almost fell(Ha!Ha!) I had been waiting for April 10th for a couple of months and the day was finally here!Track#'S 1,2,3,4,13,17(You Brought the Sunshine still a jam!) are my absolute favorites, Track#1 has been on repeat constantly in my car, that should've been the sound of the whole album which is the reason why I gave a four star rating. I know they love them some Donald Lawrence and they go way back! but I was not feeling his production on this album, it should've been recorded in the studio with the production of their ""cousin"" J.Moss/Pajam. (Live albums ain't for everybody!)but I still love the women of god!!! Be Blessed by the Clark Sisters!"
4,Good but not great.,"I found the book to an enjoyable read. The story started in the author's ""Black"" with the same people. I look foward to the next chapter in the series."
2,Convoluted,"I listened to this book while driving, and it failed to hold my attention. Very convoluted. Hard to keep track of the characters, too much techno-speak, and a very unsatisfying ending."
1,Waste of Time,"There's not an original morsel in this poor excuse for a novel. It is, in fact, a caricature of the genre made popular by Tom Clancy, namely, Armageddon Inside the Beltway. Like Clancy this author overloads his book with acronyms, characters that are stereotypical and as subtle as a bomb blast, and endless stupid plot turns that confound the reader's ability to figure out just what is going on. Whitcomb, apparently suffering from BushDerangement Syndrome (BDS) also can't resist the temptation to take a few gratuitous shots at the current president and those other favorite liberal targets: Christians and corporate types. If Al Franken were to write an Armageddon thriller, it would probably look like this. I quit reading about two-thirds through the book. I liked Whitcomb's earlier and superb non-fiction book about his life in the FBI Hostage Rescue Team and, to some extent, his first fictional offering, ""Black."" But,to my mind, ""White"" fails as a novel."
2,works okay,I primarily need a cradle charger and it works fine for that but isn't quick to dock due to the plastic cover design for the phone. The auxillary battery charger light doesn't change from green very often so I'm not sure if it is actually charging or complete.
4,Well-done detective story,Katy Munger's introductory novel of the Casey Jones series comes up a winner. A well-crafted who-done-it set in North Carolina Legwork has a heroine the reader can bond with and a rich cast of characters to keep you guessing who the real killer is.
4,A Family Made of Stories and Ballads,"Using her own family history as a springboard, Sharyn McCrumb has woven a fictitious ballad, an American geneaology, and the Appalachian landscape into an engaging novel telling one story after another, switching perspectives and historical periods effortlessly. She is a writer of considerable skill.An elderly man is dying and talking to guests who are not there; his daughter, a famous country singer, is on a quest for a song she recalls hearing once in her childhood. That song's journey is traced all the way from a pirate ship anchored off of Scotland to contemporary America. To some, we may be hearing from too many ancestors by novel's end, but the song itself speaks of change, and we watch how the song changes, along with the American nation where it has arrived, and every story matters."
1,A Whole Bunch Of Nothing!! : (,"A Whole Bunch Of Nothing!!This book is like 500 pages. And - man is it a drag! I recall - Mr. Twain - never got to finish his book. So - this is peiced together from chunks of notes and efforts he was making on it. He didn't want it released - until some years after his passing. - I don't know what the big deal was - Nothing shocking here!! Nothing!! Very little was interesting, -- and for 500 pages - Ugh!This book isn't great next to a roaring fire -- it Is Great IN a roaring fire!!My advise -- skip this book -- and go watch paint dry -- or grass grow.Sincerely, Scott MacNeil."
5,An essential work for historians of East Central Europe,"This excellent study by one of this country's leading historians of East Central Europe provides a key to understanding the fascinating and complex multi-national Habsburg monarchy through a close look at one of the very few institutions that held this sprawling empire together -- its army officer corps. Deak's social and political analysis of this group is as entertaining as it is insightful, and demonstrates a interpretative approach that could prove fruitful for historians of other countries as well. The book is certainly of interest to military historians, but its real audience is much, much broader than that."
1,Entertaining???,"I was surprised by the sharp diversity of opinion regarding this work. I'd have to side with those who found this book dull and unreadable. One of the positive reviews called the book ""entertaining"". That is one word I would NOT use to describe Deak's writing. Certainly, the subject matter is interesting and a capable writer and thoughtful historian could write a stunning and exciting treatment. This is not it. This book was written before Deak became an apologist for Pope Pius in the recent controversy over his role in the Holocaust (see _Hitler's Pope_). Undoubtedly, the notoriety will bring people to his earlier works such as this one, but they will find no fire here."
1,On Second Thought...,"Upon reading this book a second time, in light of the persuasive comments left by the other reviewers, I must agree that Deak's work leaves an awful lot to be desired. I recently read other books on the same subject, notably Wendell Gibson's _Hapsburg Diary_, which makes Deak's work seem amateurish to say the least. I recant my earlier review, which was a product of my own ignorance. I hope I didn't lead anyone to actually purchasing Mr. Deak's infantile ramblings."
2,Not what I thought,I thought it would tell me where they are but just gives clues. I guess it's a good book for those who like to be guided with the hunt. I just want the answers .
4,A Great Guide,"I purchased this because I thought it could be a great activity to use while waiting in line in Disney World. I am a seasoned Mousketeer, so I'm always looking for new Disney info.This guide seems like it would be great for lines, except that the index is not particularly convenient to quickly find out what page a specific attraction is on.However, I love that it is more hints than, ""Hey, look to your left, you will see a Hidden Mickey in the chandelier!"". It doesn't completely ruin the spirit of discovery!"
4,Great book!,"This book is very helpful in planning for a Disney Vacation! I would recommend if you like scavenger hunts. I won't be taking this with us we are more interested in the shows and if we happen to see a hidden mickey great if not, we are okay with that too."
2,*Sighs*,"They are gorgeous glasses-- IF they arrive in one piece. I placed an order for 3 sets-- got them and 7 out of 12 were broke. Then when I got the replacements, several of them were broken. And when I got some from another order, they were broken as well. They were all packed poorly. The glasses were in their boxes and thrown into a bigger box (that was too big) and bubble wrap thrown on top. Learn how to pack people! Amazon has been great about refunding my money-- but it has still been a headache."
2,Spode has changed,The original Spode- which I have some- were made in England and are of fine quality. The latest Spode is made in China and is not nearly as good. While it claims to be dishwasher safe- it is not- at least the glasses and goblets. The design washes off after one or two times in the dishwasher. I still use them but I hand wash. Just be aware of the difference as you will be expecting the really good Spode (from England) and it is not!
2,Change in quality,I have collected Spode Christmas Tree items for more than 30 years. I had 8 Pedestal Goblets and felt I needed 4 more to complete my set. When I received the final 4 the quality of the glasses had declined greatly. You can immediately tell the difference between the glasses I have had for several years and the new goblets. The new ones are much lighter and the decals can be scratched easily. I have to be very very careful that they are not damaged. I am very disappointed!
3,Broken Glass,"I ordered two Spode place settings for four and two boxes of the goblets. When I received the package the box everything was packed in was way bigger then necessary. Instead of leaving the goblets in the boxes they were sold in, they were unpacked, wrapped in bubble wrap and placed lose in the giant box with the folded up boxes they are sold in, the two really heavy boxes of dinnerware and a bunch of paper stuffing. When my order arrived amazingly only one of the goblets was shattered, but I had to order another box to replace the broken one. Don't ever order the goblets at the same time you order the dinnerware for four, or you may not get them all in one piece.The goblets and dinnerware were beautiful and well made."
2,Not the same,"I had received a set of 4 of these goblets a few years ago. My set was made in the USA. I ordered another set of 4. The glasses are definitely different. The new set is slightly lighter in weight. The green of the tree holly is much, much lighter than the original set that I have. There is a very noticeable difference when the glasses are side by side. The new set looks like the color has faded away.The glasses do come with a sticker that says ""hand wash"". They were well packed and nothing was broken or chipped."
3,80's ROCK,I only have WILD'N'EVIL. It is a cross between Saxon and Thin Lizy. For an 80's rock band it is pretty good. Its almost garage band music. The lyrics are sung not screamed. Listen to it more than once and you will like it. I am 34 and like all rock old and new. I would like to know if newer Sinner is good.
2,I&#65533;ve got a headache,"While users new to C++ might be enchanted with Visual C++ .NET, those of us who have been programming with VC++ for years will be disgusted. Visual C++ has been relegated to a the same tier held by FoxBASE. All of the new .NET examples are in C# or VB.Thankfully, I downloaded the evaluation copy, and didn't purchase the non-refundable software.The first thing I noticed was that the Visual Studio IDE has been entirely rewritten.The Visual Studio C++ class wizard is gone. Yes. Gone. You will have to spend time (and a large amount of it) to relearn how to add events, message handlers, and otherwise get up to speed with the VB-ish property window.Granted, this version does have better ANSI standards compliance, better support for templates, and some optimizations.If you only need to write native C++ code, pass on this product."
4,A great souvenir,I picked this up on a visit to San Antonio. The book is full of color photographs of the city and makes a nice momento of my trip.
5,Set up long but straight forward- Play value A+,"We got this as a gift for my 5 and 10 year old boys. Although lengthy to set up (99 pages/87 steps and ~3.5 hours with a power screwdriver)the instructions are the best I have seen for any item- not just toys, I have ever assembled. It gives tips along the way to make sure you don't mix things up, and the parts are keyed very well. Once built, the play value is incredible. The advanced games are challenging enough for any kid, and lots of adults too. If your kids like throwing, kicking or wacking a ball or puck around--get it!!"
2,slim in 6 VHS phase 3,"Received promptly, however, vhs was cracked where one reel is,still works but not worth the $23.00 paid and I thought I was getting more than 1 video. Not so happy about it!"
3,Okay Headphones,"Weak noise-cancellation. Mediocre sound quality. Not the best, but I think I got them for a decent price."
2,"A romp all right, but...","... I have a bit of a problem with the treatment of Pet. I can allow Ellen's lust for revenge against a prim and prissy Stephanie--after all, children are vicious, sometimes, to each other, and I felt it was clear that this ongoing battle between the two girls was clearly depicted as such; in fact, Edgar and Ellen are also well-explained as deviant mentalities. But to have the two of them mistreat an animal (of whatever sort it is) seems to promote such treatment of animals as fun, or cool, somehow. I found that disturbing.The characters are one-dimensional, but after all, this is what it is--a tale of two evil imps on yet another crusade to destroy something they feel is in their megalomaniacal way.I think a parent could do better in choosing summer reading for his/her child."
2,"Great Album , horrible sound quality","Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band is Disco Big Band at its best. One could not find a more unique sound in the late 70's US Disco scene. The only downside is that the sound is horrible on this disc. The liner notes mention that it is remastered , but that begs to be questioned. I only hope that this seminal late 70's band is rediscovered so we can see a truly superior version of this album on CD."
5,"Upbeat, fun and lyrically tight!","This is the type of music that Buster Poindexter wishes his career could obtain. Fast, Loose but lots of fun, this and the follow up group , Kid Creole and the Coconuts deliver true good time music."
1,Don't Buy this book,"This book is only useful for pointing someone in the direction of rock to climb on, BUT this guide is basically useless. Several of the areas that I know well are very poorly described and even contain errors."
4,sven vath youngster pop star,"hey people here is sven vathvery cool music he is the lead singerand his voice is owesomeprodeced by sven vath/ lucas anzilotti/michael munzing\so if you ever get to se this albun do not think to get it, very rare and very interesting music.its when the electronic music started.and now MR sven is one of the best djs on the planet earth or the best i could say, but you have to listen to his music OFF so you get the good feeling and could enjoy todays sven vath music."
3,A Little Disappointing,"The album seems to me more like random songs thrown together haphazardly than a collection. The quality varies widely from track to track and so does the equalization which necessitates constant readjustment of the tone controls. Still Doris is Doris, and although I prefer the ""Doris Day Golden Girl"" collection instead, tastes vary."
4,A nice package,Latest magnetically coupled design with low electrical consumption.No complaints except that it is Italian and not American made.It will not recirculate any spaghetti but does a nice job on my 800 gal. pond waterfall.
5,Sheer delight!,"I picked this up because I am looking forward to reading John Scalzi's new book Fuzzy Nation, and I wanted to know what inspired him. I am so glad I did! They just don't write them that way any more!On the planet Zarathustra prospector Jack Holloway comes across a cute little animal he names Little Fuzzy...and then he begins to suspect that Little Fuzzy may be more than an animal. The last thing the Corporation that has the charter for Zarathustra wants is a sapient species to be discovered on the planet, because the existence of sapient life means that their charter will be replaced by one that is much more restrictive. The bad guys do bad things in order to prevail, but you know that justice & Little Fuzzy will prevail in the end.This classic deserves to be read even today."
2,"Unconfortable, stiff material",The style is cute but the shoe is not at all comfortable if you need to walk around much during the day. It's a little narrow and pinches on the front sides. I returned these.
5,what can i say?,"There is nothing to say, this is a classic and will always smell good and be one of the fragrances ever.."
3,Well written awful story.,"This book was well written and the translation was good too, but the character is such a jerk, who cares? If you feel compelled to read it, try the library first."
3,A real disappointment!,"Being a long time Faron Young fan,I was really excited to see this collection offered. However,after I got it and played it,I was really disappointed. The songs on this cd don't appear to be the original versions,and although a few of them were ok,overall the originals would have been much better. I was particularly disappointed in the version of ""I Miss You Already""presented here-some of the words were changed and the arrangement was different. If you are a die hard Faron Young,you might want to get this,otherwise,I don't recommend it."
3,Best Giraffe Ever,My girlfriend loves it. She named it Henry Lemark. Too bad it looks nothing like a giraffe :)
4,A Guilty Pleasure,"I'll be the first to admit that The Pinehurst Kids' swan-song CD is nothing groundbreaking, but it's a great collection of songs that are mostly breezy feel-good numbers, changed up nicely with some heavier tunes ('heavier' is a relative term, and those heavy songs are still performed by clean-cut kids in appropriate attire). Joe Davis knows how to write a song, with proper bridges and key-changes here and there to keep your interest. (Apart from the synth solo in ""All I Know"" , which is uncharacteristically lame.) Fans of Samiam and Jimmy Eat World, take note: Here's another worthwhile CD for your collection, full of satisfying riffs and hooks and sing-along lyrics to buoy you through your day. Very nice."
4,All the Ships at Sea,"I had remembered this book when I was in the Navy in Korea in 1952 and had not seen it in stores. It is impressive indicating the influence of one individual on the entire crew of a ship. I had used it as a text when I had to pinch hit for a chaplain on the Hospital Ship. The book, although old was in very good condition."
5,Ken Smith is a demented genius!,"The funniest Bible book I've ever read, and I've read a few. Ken's Guide focuses solely on the strange, weird, SICK parts of the Good Book, the parts that never get mentioned by your pastor or neighborhood born-again. Powerful stuff, if only because Ken keeps his prattle to a minimum and lets the Bible hang itself with its own words. Ken's research and acid wit are brutal, and the Guide is compact and easy-to-read (unlike the Bible itself). Every page has something twisted and fun; I never knew the Bible could be so entertaining. My only question: Who the hell is Ken Smith"
5,Nice fit & feel!,"I really liked these scrub pants! Very comfortable! Also, they have a tiny bit of a sheen to them, so your scrub top will drape nicely over the waist/hips of these pants. Colors are VERY nice (I ordered three colors). Also, the fact that there are no pockets at the hips makes for a more slimming profile (pockets are located further down on the legs, as is common with 'cargo' type pants). The cut is true-to-size, perhaps even a bit on the generous side, so do not order larger than you think you need!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$,THE ITEM SHOWN IS NOT WHAT THIS MERCHANT SENT ME!!!! I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!!! AS MUCH MONEY AS I SPEND HERE - BELIEVE ME - I WILL BE CONTACTING AMAZON TO INFORM THEM OF THIS MERCHANT'S BLATANT MISREPRESENTATION OF IT'S PRODUCT!!!!!!!!
1,dont waste your money,season 6 part 1 is exactly the same as season 5 totally a waste of moneynothing new happened all episodes were repeated. big disppointment. and feel like i was ripped off by HBO
3,Wasted Format,"I have to agree with everyone that the episodes themselves are great. Bluray is the only way to watch TV on HDTV. My complaint is in the packaging of the Box set.Why force people to buy TWO BOX sets or 4 disks each to watch what can easily fit on a SINGLE Bluray Disk??? HBO shows complete lack of respect for Consumers, not to mention the enviroment.The 4 disks are formatted the same as a normal DVD. Wasting 90% of the disk space.This becomes a huge headache when you actually sit down to watch video. I like to come home from work and sit down and power up the entertainment center and WATCH my programs.Instead, I get to power up and go to the episode index looking for the next episode. Only to be told I need to change disks.Sorry for the rant. Over all great material."
4,"Read the fine print, people.","This set contains 12 episodes, just like all the previous seasons. Season 6 was always meant to have two parts, part 1 with 12 episodes, part 2 with 8 episodes. It remains to be seen how much the part 2 DVD will cost, but for now, you are really not getting ripped off."
4,The Sopranos get 5 stars but...,The videos could give more. The packaging is over the top and I would have liked to see more content instead. There are a few episodes with narration but the narrators go off on tangents during scenes I would rather have 'narrated'.The show is 5 star as far as I'm concerned. I am glad to have it in my library. Just don't need the 'shiny box'!
1,Defective product,Ordered Part One TWICE - both versions defect - cd's will not start so very poor quality. Still waiting for funds to be returned by Amazon.com
2,Just not much there,"Overpriced for no more than you really get.I found this season to be a stinker.Overhyped much like movie Crash.Acting is good in spots but those spots cannot outshine the dark, utter idiocy that is the unrealistic showing of this lifestyle. So tough to walk around and shoot at people and then just go eat breakfast! Please, do a series on mercenaries at least they are real, and are for real and not posers. This is a fantasy and nothing more. Really not any value in this kind of series for anything to do good from. I will add some good tags on this one, thanks!"
5,"The Sopranos - Season 6, Part 1 [Blu-ray]","Fantastic. The Sopranos on Blu-ray with great picturs and sound. What is more, this DVD is actually an ""All Region"" release and not ""Region 1"" as stated on the package and the Amazon product details.Looking forward to Season 6 Part 2 but hope there will be a few more extras."
1,Bad Pad,"This is a bad mouse pad. It LOOKS great but it has a large point in the center in the crest of the wave where it doesn't respond and it's hard to get precise movements out of it. It's good for large movements around the edges of the pad, but if I were shopping for pads, and I knew about this one I'd spend some extra money on a different one. Try to get a better mouse pad than this."
4,The AT and its guide,"The ""Appalachian Trail Guide to Maryland and Northern Virginia"" is an excellent companion to hikers on the appalacian trial. The guide details, step by step, the trail and what to expect on it. It gives detail descriptions of where/where not to camp, water supplies, and distances between points. If you are setting out on the trail...take the guide with you. It'll be your best friend."
2,Disappointing,Cisco lite - a thin book with not much content. Heavy on PR; light on insight. I expected more from Bunnell.
4,Takes me back-totally,"I obtained this album with a 5 finger discount. We were almost caught by the PD of Oak Park Heights,MN. Your ZZ Top's play list is not complete without IT'S ONLY LOVE. One of the best songs from them in my humble opinion.Rock-On"
1,What's the problem guys?,"Couldn't agree more. Nothing needed to be remixed on ANY of their albums up to and including Deguello, and even El Loco. The best solution since they are too greedy stupid to restore them to their original sound? Get some good software, get a USB turntable, and record those vinyl albums onto mp3 format. Yeah, you'll need to tweak the volume and EQ a little, but you'll get the great sound those albums are supposed to have. The reason for them doing these remixes? Simple: Corporate greed, nothing else."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD,"If you want to hear ZZ Top, find their original LPs. The CDs that are available are an insult to the quality inspired musicianship the band once had. They are essentially re-recordings, and it's a shame that anyone who buys a CD is not going to hear the true ZZ, and why they were one of the best bands of the 70s. BUY THE LP or CASSETTE!!!"
2,Creating Character Emotions,"I found this book not to be all that great. I expected a lot more from this book. It elaborates too much on the authors personal feelings. She catagorizes all readers as the same. And we ARE NOT! The book is more for people who use big and fancy words to describe what he/she thinks and/or feels. She does give a lot of great examples of all the emotions but some of them are very hard to understand as well as hard to identify with the emotion. It tells you how to express emotions in a more extravagant way. Which is nice, but it's nothing that most every writer or ispiring writer does not already know. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs a 'brush-up' on descibing emotions."
3,Just average,"This book is fairly disappointing as it lacks spice. The first half was okay to read, but after reading the first two discussions on emotions, I put it down and went to sleep. The only reason why I give it 3 stars is the fact that I got it at a very reasonable price as a used book. If you really need to know about emotions and working it into your characters, I don't think this is it. Keep on looking."
3,"Good Idea, But","This book is organized into 36 chapters, each about an emotion that a character in fiction might have, starting with Anger and ending with Worry, all in alphabetical order. In most cases, the explanation of the emotion is accurate, but in some cases it's confusing. The examples of insufficient/inadequate ways to show a character experiencing this emotion and the good/great ways to show it are sometimes good, sometimes inadequate. For a writer who wants to learn how to show his/her character and emotion, there are better books, such as the one by Schmidt and the one by Edelstein."
3,mainly for the novelist,A great book of descriptions but mainly for the novelist. An depth discussion of emotional reactions but it doesn't really help the screenwriter.
5,I'm in it so I guess I'm a little biased!,"I was part of the cast and crew of this little gem, and I have never worked so hard or had so much fun as I did working on this movie. If you want to see a truly independent, no-budget film this is it! The reason I worked with Georg and want to work with him again is that I saw what he had done before. And the reason I want to work with him again is because this movie is wonderfully shot and masterfully edited. There is also some fantastic acting. Georg Koszulinski does the festival tour so keep eyes open for his next picture, shot in 16mm."
1,LEGO Batman WAY OVERPRICED,"Shame on you LEGO. As if the Star wars sets are not expensive enough, the batman series seem even more over priced"
3,Simple and eye-catching,"Introduce your young ones to the traditions and celebrations of our culture with this very simple book that features a few words on each page with brightly colored pictures. Each celebration has a sentence indicating its theme, and the other page in the spread has an appropriate expression for that occasion. The book may be used to teach simple etiquette for birthdays, Mother's Day, Thanksgiving, winning a sporting event, and weddings. The pictures feature kids and families of different races, and the last two pages include comments in smaller type for the parent/teacher to introduce the history of the celebration and the traditions of other cultures."
5,Classic Mancini,"I knew I was old when my daughter asked who is Mancini? And she doesn't like either his Christmas or regular music. Nevertheless his ""sound"" means Christmas to me. Not all the songs on this album are wonderful, and the vocals merely good, but these arrangements capture the mood of that era."
5,Good reading,"I really enjoy reading her books with all the adventure, love and solving the crimes. I also enjoy the Nora Roberts stories as well."
5,They just keep getting better...,"Every time I read one of the J.D. Robb books, I'm positive that they can't get any better. And the next one always is. This one is no exception."
4,Good blend of past and future,"A theater in the future. A stage play performed in the technologically-advanced days yet to come. Shakespearian genius meeting the likes of Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking. What am I rambling about? I'm rambling about Witness in Death, a book which combines past and present (ours) with the future in which it is set.I really liked the backdrop of a murder at the theater. You have a thousand witnesses, which should make for an open and shut case, but often times 1000 people see things 1000 different ways. What looks like an advantage actually turns out to be a bit of a problem for Eve as she fights her way through an investigation that's anything but open and shut. As in the theater, disguise is the key... and things are often not what they seem."
4,Works just like it should,I used this battery for 3 weeks to charge my psp (exclusively--I left the psp ac adapter at home) while traveling. I wish it had a charge indicator. That is the only reason I don't rate it 5 stars.
5,Terrific guide to maximizing the benefits of pilates!,"After taking pilates classes for more than two years, I have acquired several books and videos with the aim of supporting workouts at home. This is by far the best! Not only does it include many useful sequences for home workouts to fit needs and schedules (last section), but it provides a wonderful orientation to pilates and to all of its main exercises. For each exercise, the book includes: clear steps to follow, a diagram of a man or woman doing the exercise, benefits (in relation to particular body parts strengthened, general physical outcomes, and mental benefits), how to listen to your body while doing the exercize, and how to spiritually ground it. Shirley Archer does a wonderful job of integrating instruction for pilates as an exercise program with guidance for experiencing the range of its physical, mental, and spiritual benefits. The book is great for pilates beginners and devotees!"
4,Green Tea,We have tried several green teas and we find this one to be the best tasting. It also has a good price point when we take advantage of the auto ordering.
4,Good item,Adapter is perfect for my needs for my older HP iPAQ device. Some older product parts are hard to find. Glad I found this one.
2,CD in poor condition,"I was pretty disapointed to see its cover was broken. The CD itself was ok, but as it was a gift to my brother, it was quite embarassing."
5,"Elvis the ""KING""","If you love Elvis &/or you love Country Music you will love this album. I have the original LP of this CD, unfortunately they did not include all the songs from the LP. This album proves that Elvis is ""KING"" and can sing any kind of music."
1,This CD belongs in the litter box.,"I love KISS and Peter Criss. I like all kinds of music, both rock and the softer stuff.But this album is horrible.Not because the songs are lighter.Just because they plain suck.Peter Criss states that he self produced it. It sounds like it.Lyrics are horrible.Many, many embarrasing moments.I personally like the ""tender, emotionally aimed"" tribute ONE FOR ALL complete with a drum roll and Peter yelling ""Look Out""! Yea, Peter, that fits this song perfectly.I am a KISS fan and will buy any music these guys put out. This is bad. At least buy it at Best Buy and get an autographed copy."
1,This Must Be A Joke!,"This is pure and complete crap. I can't believe there is an album that is worse than the 1978 album by this clown, sorry, cat and an album worse than Gene's A**hole album but this is it. HE CAN'T SING IN KEY, HE CAN'T DRUM AND HE HAS NO TALENT! Peter, go check into a rest home and be done!"
2,one for less,"El gato se ha hecho mayor, ahora hace easy listening. Me ha decepcionado el disco de Peter Criss, esperaba algo con más garra, aunque goza de un gran sonido y el conserva su voz como siempre, los temas me resultan algo flojos, a parte de algunas covers bien llevadas.En fin, ...quizá en su próxima vida (creo que los gatos tienen 7, no?)"
1,Waste of Money,"I am extremely disappointed with Peter's new cd. I could barely get thru it. Very sad and depressing. I should have bought another copy of Paul Stanleys "" Live to Win "". Now that is a great cd."
1,What?,"You have to face it. You had one hit, just one. You didn't even write the whole song yourself, you had to have help. If it wasn't for some radio station who flipped over Detroit Rock City, this song would have never hit the air waves. Besides, everone who heard it thought that it was Rod Stewart singing it. You need to come to terms with yourself, stop making music, You are a ""One Hit Wonder""!!!!!!!!!!"
1,This album makes Spandau Ballet sound like Slayer,"This album gets one star because it has one good quality. It will cure insomnia!! This is a very disappointing album. I am a huge Kiss fan and I really like Peter's first solo album very much. Now in purchasing this I knew not to expect anything sounding like Kiss at all. Not even expecting anything hard rock oriented. But I at least expected something with some sort of groove, like his first solo album. There is absolutley no rhythm or groove anywhere on the record. The album is so slow and dragged out and there seems to be no style to it. This is beyond soft rock, it's sleep music. Not one upbeat song here. I still like Peter Criss and I still have faith that he can come up with better music. I would love to know how many copies this actually sold. Please, Cat Man, I know you can do better than that!"
5,CD,"Much to our surprise, we discovered while at a family reunion that were were related to the composer, Dawson! It is a marvelous concert of classical music."
3,This book does not exist as such,"Judging by the ISBN, Ultimatum is an early or alternate title for Friedman's novel Reunion, the first hardcover ST: TNG novel. There is no ST book in print called Ultimatum."
2,Better products out there.....,"The quality was not what I expected for the price, I believe there are better products to be found. They did not include the screws for placement either so if ordering be prepared when it comes time to put it up."
4,works well,"This stuff really works well... but it's not really clear, it's white, so it's very visible if you're using it on clear items. It also doesn't come off easily at all, so not great if it something you want to move or sell. I had much better results with the museum gel."
4,good stuff!,I needed a non-permanent product to hold my little ceramic horses steady (so the cats wouldn't knock them over) but not be visible. This stuff works! Is just tacky enough to hold but not so sticky it can't be removed.
3,Two Batteries 50/50 Chance.,"I did get the batteries but one did not work, it would not take a charge and I tried it all day, but the other one worked great. I steal do need another as a back up. I hope it's in the mail back to me soon, when I work overtime at night.it's not good when your cell phone goes out when your talking to your supervisor on the condition of the problems that your having to deal with, to try and fix the system and get it back on line.Thank You, Tom."
5,A Life Savor of a Book!,This beautifully written work of truth is a must for the person desiring happiness and clarity of mind and spirit. It truly is a remarkable way of looking at one's emotions and understanding the complexity of our feelings. The authors share their knowledge and insights into the human condition and offer the reader the keys to transformation and change. Thank you for an incredible journey through growth and into freedom!
5,Don't visit Disney w/o reading this book first!,"The author really knows his way around Walt Disney World! The book is written in a concise, easy to read, entertaining manner. He gives great advice on what to see and what not to waste time on. The detailed itineraries given are especially good, to help avoid the crowds and get the most fun into a day. I live in the Orlando area and know the parks fairly well, but I learned a lot to make my next visits even more interesting! Have seen several other books about WDW, and this is by far the best!! Highly recommended!"
5,Au Contraire!,"I strongly recommend this book for all who approach life with open mind and the heart of a student. I suspect the ""Shalom Freedom"" commentator does not fall under that category.There is an old Middle-Eastern saying: ""One can learn a lot about a person by looking at his enemies."" If Ilan Pappe's work is attacked because it takes a far more nuanced view of the bloody conflict between Palestinians and Israel, then that reason by itself warrants the study of its content. After reading this book, I wonder if some Israelies would still be so dismissive of political equality for Palestinians if it was the Palestinians who had the guns and the military might that Israel enjoys today. Please read this book even if you have already made up your mind about what you think it proposes."
4,Dr. Altshuler sees both sides,"Dr. Larry Altshuler gives a lot of very useful information about both supplements and prescriptions. That balance can be hard to find in an MD.Thanks, Dr. Altshuler."
3,Altschuler's book's a good one...,"This book is not as comprehensive as the Encyclopedia of Healing, but for a book that balances 'western' and 'alternative' healings it is a good primer. I would have liked more diagrams and charts for Acupressure or other techniques instead of the lists of where to find practicioners... I like it because I have some serious health stuff that requires a lot of interaction with the 'western' medical community (to my gratitude), but want to supplement and perhaps mediate some of the side effects of the 'western' treatments that keep me alive. I like Dr. Altschuler's tone, very readable and accessible. Glad to have it on my shelf."
3,"Great Material, Bad Editting","I live in China and have seen almost all the places mentioned in this book. At least the ones that survived the time. The material is great, if biased towards the Imperial regime, but that is expected. However, the editting is awful. The book looks and fels cheap, chapters are not clearly marked,... It looks like someone just printed it and then put it in abinder. Great disservice to teh book and what it has to offer."
1,Waste of Money,I am a student of chinese history and was totally disappointed in this book it came across as the ramblings of an old man. If I could give 1/4 of a star I would.
2,You must know,"I've been a CJ fan for a long time and I have to tell the truth about this album (which some others, even those giving five stars, seemed to allude to): it is awful.I heard from other CJ fans that this was a stinker but I had to listen for myself. I wish I hadn't. I can't believe they put this thing out. It is just really bad.I can't believe this is the same band that put out Trinity Sessions next.I hate that the amount of stars this album has gotten in reviews might make a new fan think this is a good place to start. It isn't. Start with Caution Horses or TS.People who give this thing five stars out of some loyalty to the band are really doing more harm than good: this is not representative of their work."
1,high style but low quality,"I bought a pair of la gear a few months ago. I have worn them for just about 20 days (outdoor walking only), and they already show cracks near the sole.I am extremely disappointed. I bought them for the name and style, and the price. But even for a low price, the quality is simply unacceptable."
4,Still Great despite his condition,"I'm too young to remember Elvis but buying this CD turned out to be a good choice. Sure he was not in good shape by June 1977, but at least he had his voice. His takes of ""You Gave Me A Mountain"", ""My Way"", and ""How Great Thou Art"" are really superb. This is a great album to get and what a way to see or hear how he sounded before his death in August 1977."
1,Not the way to remember Elvis,"Like every other Elvis album I ran to buy it on release, but in the cold light of day the performances are generally average, and many sub standard. His ill health is showing and his voice is lacking on some songs, most notably ""FairyTale"", ""Little Sister"" and ""Hawaiian Wedding Song"". When Elvis speaks he sounds laboured and it hurts to hear. It is not all down, the version of ""I Really Don't Want to Know"" and ""My Way"" stand up well, and Elvis still hows his enjoyment of being before a live audience. However in light of many other live recordings released before and after his death, this collection simply is poor. It may have been the last concert tour, last TV special, and for that it is memorable, more than it is for the performance. If you want to remember Elvis at his live best, try the ""On Stage"", ""Thats The Way it Is box set, or some of the tracks from ""Burning Love"" or ""Walk a Mile in My Shoes"" masters and remember the king the best way."
5,Elvis always rocks!!,"Forget about critcs. This is an Elvis original and official testament. If you like... good , if not...., try another thing.... I like it and it makes me happy!!! Cheers!!"
1,Very crap,"The standard of poetry used by Kim to put forward his bigoted ideas is pathetically poor. His command of the English language is hopeless, I can only assume that he is a non-native speaker. Kim's poems are a bit like an old and bitter mans rants. The poems are awkward to read because they simply fail to flow. The messages portray Christianity as a violent religion, which is probably true when you consider how they behaved in the crusades. The most offensive message conveyed within these poems is the one that Abdul picked upon i.e. the idea that Christianity is superior to all other faiths. This idea is simply nonsense, afterall, Islam is the fastest growing religion whilst Christianity is fading away.If you want to read good poems then this is not the book for you."
3,Hmm. . .,"I thought this stand would be much larger. In order to cradle an ostrich egg safely in it, you really need to get out some double-stick tape. Nice item for smallish eggs."
1,Didn't work,"I purchased this to reattach the stem on a drinking glass that had broken very cleanly. The surface area where the break occurred was large (the size of a penny or so) and the break had been so clean that the surface was perfectly smooth on both sides of the break.I prepared the surfaces according to the instructions, followed them to a T, and it appeared to be fixed. Three days later, it broke off again. So, I started over, re-did everything exactly as it said to again, and again it broke off after a few days.I cannot imagine something actually lasting through the dishwasher as this alleges you could wash something in the dishwasher after using it to repair a break.i will likely try it again at some point when I have a chance, but thus far I have no confidence in this product."
1,One film series well worth the boycott,Anybody who's been listening to the news lately will know what Jackass is all about.And that is why I'm giving this film one star only.People are fed up with actors playing the roles of individuals they're told are real and if they questioned it a few years ago they used to be punished.I think it's over for Jackass.Even if Jackass 4 does come out I'll boycott that too.Let the boycotting of Jackass continue!Screw Jackass to the smithereens!
4,Wow! $75.00 for a bath towel?,"Ok...bath SHEET, but I just couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this price jump.I purchased one of these and another in the light green a few weeks ago for $15.00 each. They are nice, soft, absorbent material and I thought made pretty well. A small area of the side hem (6-8 inches) on the green one was unraveled when I removed it from the dryer after the initial wash leading me to believe that they might be seconds. They are a nice size, approximately between my largest ""bath"" towels and a beach towel. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase more if I needed them...for the $15 price. I'd certainly never pay $75.00, but possibly I'm overlooking something about these towels that makes them extra special."
2,I DO NOT LIKE IT,"IT HAS A METALIC TASTE TO IT...I DON'T THINK IT IS STAINLESS STEELALSO IT WAS DIRTY, IT HAD SOME TYPE OF BROWN THING ON THE SIDEOF THE SCRAPER, CLEANED IT OFF AND IT CAME OUT....WAS THIS USED?"
4,Impressed,I'm thoroughly impressed with this rest. I had been having trouble with grouping with my old worn rest so I purchased this one since you couldn't argue with the price and now I'm glad I did. 3.5 inch groups from 40 yards and touching holes at closer ranges. I'm very happy with my purchase and you will be too.
5,The Best for Your Party,"This CD contains one of the best songs I ever encountered. Although the theme is extraordinarily simple, the dynamic beat and the few chords will catch everybody who listens to Rofo's theme. There are no lyrics (except ""Let's go""), but that does not have any negative effect but puts emphasis on the cool drumbeats. In my opinion the original version is still the best one. The PWL mix is not bad, but it does not have that power of the original version. It sounds a little dull, even though the cheers in the background are infective. The radio edit you can find on this CD as well is just too short. You should listen to a long version (such as the original one) of Rofo's theme to feel the energy. I encourage you to buy this CD, but remember that Rofo's theme is a song for a party or for a fast car ride (in case you have a good HIFI - system), but definitely not for a coffee klatsch."
1,Waste of time!!,Comparing this book to Jean's Auel's Clan of the Cave Bear is an insult. The gruesome details of the people of Ka's brutality and hatred were a real turn off. It's also hard to believe Eena and Agon's 3 year old son could be so consumed with hate for his father that he vows to kill him. And all those similar names! I lost track of who the characters were. I forced myself to finish the book because I kept thinking it might get better. I was wrong.
5,MEMORABLE,"As a child, I grew up listening to the Limelighters as my parents had seen their nightclub acts and purchased all their albums. Their songs, which are ballads from across many lands, consist of hilariously funny audience group participation as well as tender songs of love. The Kingston Trio was a fantastic group, but in my mind never held a candle to the genius of the The Limelighters. Lou Gottlieb's quick witted ad-libbing was genius in itself and Alex Hassiliev was the quiet baritone. But Glenn Yarbrough, my favorite, has a clear splendid voice that when accompanied by his beautiful whistling brought forth great tenderness to his ballads of lost loves. This album consists of some of their most memorable songs. My son, also, grew up listening to this tremendous group and now three generations of our family have loved the Limelighters!"
2,DVD only works on a computer,"I have every single DVD release from Big Country, as they are one of the greatest bands ever. This DVD only plays on my computer and I have only all region DVD players in my house. It just will not work. All the other Big COuntry DVD's will play in an all region player, but not this one. It would have been great to see this on a big screen, but no go. Buyer beware."
3,Sound is good - VIDEO IS NOT!,"If all I were interested in was the sound, then I would just listen to the CD and forget the video, but I really like watching DP play, but I was really disappointed in the video quality. I realize that this was filmed over 30 years ago; it's outdoors and dark, and filming technology was not what it is now, but one would think that the picture could have been enhanced. The two bonus songs are just the first two songs, but only from another camera angle, and surprisingly, the video quality is better - so not sure why the rest of the set isn't."
4,Lice Be gone!,"I have had the unfortunate task of dealing with the nightmare of LICE. I read the book and used some of the advice with the olive oil. Then I used NiX which worked after using it twice the first week and then when lice came back, used it 2 more times.Thankfully it is now, knock on all wood surfaces :), gone. I recommend the book if you need it, and I wish you all the luck in the world!!!"
3,You only have to close your eyes,"This is a good concert, but better you'd go to de CD version. Otherwise you'll have to close your eyes because only a glance to the Jon Anderson clothes is too much for your mental health if you wanna keep loving Yes music.This DVD and the one from Keys to AScension break all the good taste rules.Better go to Montreux, Symphonic Live, House of Yes, Tongas or even Union Tour DVDs. In everyone of them you can enjoy the music of Yes without any extra dosis of suffering"
4,I Love It,"I got it thrown in for free when I purchased my MP3 player. Without the noise cancellation turned on, I needed to increase the volume to almost double. But I could still listen to songs just fine after that. The noise cancellation feature is of course awesome. With it turned on, I'm like completely zoned out from the rest of the world - free from any distracting noises.I also find the soft cushionny 'ear muffs' very comfortable and even after using it for hours, my ears were a-ok and not at all sore.To think I got it for free. It's a steal!"
4,"Scene-It, Music edition","Not extremely extension on the music trivia (wish there were more pre-1970's trivia), but it is a fun game."
5,A broad distribution of John Denver Favorites,"This is an excellent John Denver album showing the wide range of his singing and composing talents. It includes ballads like ""Annie's Song"" and ""My Sweet Lady"" to knee-slappin', toe tappin' favorites ""Thank God I'm a Country Boy"" and ""Grandma's Feather Bed. And for all you environmentalists out there his ""Calypso,"" a tribute to the late Jaques Cousteu (although not deceased when Denver wrote it) is wonderful."
1,Sexual Portraits: Photographs of radical sexuality,"the title of this book is deceiving, the only thing I got out of it was a bunch of portrait and body shots with piercings and tatoos"
1,This one should be pulled from the shelves!,"I can't believe this version of this album still exists because Capital has released this same album from the master recordings. The ONLY difference is this one has 2 extra tracks (12"" extended versions.) For $45, I can locate the two 12 inches and Capital's version, plus buy another used CD! PTG played themselves on this one, but still one of the best when it comes to recording CD's from vinyl. Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike BB&Q at all or this album. One star is the rating for the price of the release because Capital's version is an Import, too, and is better quality! Your choice, Amazoners..."
5,"Adorable santa hat, high quality too.","This is a great santa hat. It isn't the cheap felt hat, it's really nice. Although, it was big for son's head. He was 3 months and we had to safety pin it to get it to fit. At a year old it still fits - barely. It's still a really nice hat if you don't mind needing to pin it. It's probably best for a 6-9 month old."
4,"Excellent CD, but too many ""garage bands"" that sound bad.","I am a huge fan of Pulley, and I came across this CD looking for a new Pulley album(I own 60 cycle hum and Esteem driven engine)....A NEW PULLEY TRACK!!! This is an alround great album if you are a punk fan because i gives you a bit of everything like, some hardcore stuff, some softer stuff and some horrible stuff. I suggest buying it if you are a fan of anykind of ""new"" punk."
1,Puh-leeze,"I picked up this disjointed piece of dreck at the local library booksale. (If nobody checks out a book for more than two or three years, they don't keep it. Now I know why.) Turns out it was a total waste of my 25 cents. Mr. Thomas ""uncovers"" conspiratorial ""connections"" which would only be plausible to an intellectually-challenged, unmedicated paranoid schizophrenic. See, the Gubbament doesn't want you to know about Stuff, see, and so they like, brainwash people and stuff, see ... it's a fact! Puh-leeze, the X-files was fiction there, bubba. It is illuminating to note that two of the 5-star reviews for this windy and disjointed diatribe are by the author himself, and another touts how utterly engrossing it was for an eight-year-old. Ahem. In short, if you are in need of kindling, I heartily recommend you check out this author's other vanity press works. And K-k-k-ken(n), better kept your curtains closed, 'cause THEY'RE WATCHING!!! Ooooooo, scary!"
4,Very Good!,"I have never been very interested in details of the Civil War, that is until I read this book. Historical fiction based on the Battle of Franklin, brings the lives lost and historical detail to the forefront. Franklin, Tennessee, is calling me, to visit the battle ground and Carnton, and to experience, even on a minute scale, a piece of our American history.Parts of the book were slow but overall, really enjoyed this novel."
5,fascinating!!,"This book had me, a Civil War geek, really excited . . . I love novels from this time period, anyway, but as I started reading it I realized how close to home it really was. I live in Nashville, and the Battle of Franklin happened probably 20-30 miles from my house. I recognized family names and the names of streets, towns, etc . . . and the main character was the same age as me at the time. This was a very well-written book; Robert Hicks did his research and paired the facts with great personal stories."
1,"Book Excellent, Narration Horrible","This was a wonderfully written book, but the voice of the narrator on the audio CD was so annoying I could not listen to it."
5,Great story,"This book was amazing. I enjoy historical fiction and this one did not disappoint. Robert Hicks did a wonderful job in describing the environment. I could smell the gunpower, I could hear the wood floor boards creak as soldiers walked across them in Mrs. McGavock's home, I could see the horrors of war. The Providence Journal stated, ""Perhaps the best Civil War novel since Cold Mountain."" PERHAPS? This book was better than Cold Mountain."
5,A Memorable and Well-Written Historical Novel...,"Never would I have thought anyone could write this well about such a devastating battle. I had previously read of the battle at Franklin, but this novel adds the necessary context to many of the events that took place. A great deal of research and thought went into writing this well, and the author is to be highly commended for his work!I originally read this book upon checking it out at the library. However, I simply enjoyed reading it so much, it became necessary to purchase a copy for myself. There are so many new insights to be gained upon reading a book the second and third time. I felt this was one of those books. I will ALWAYS treasure this novel as it speaks to the very human and caring side of everyone's character..."
5,LOVE Debby Dubay's ANTIQUE LIMOGES AT HOME!,"Antique Limoges at Home is Ms Dubay's second book on antique Limoges porcelain and she has outdone herself! I love her books! Ms Dubay collaborates with other porcelain authors and this enlightens me as a antique Limoges porcelain collector. The quality of the book is fabulous and the photographs are beautiful! Complete values, complete marks section, complete information on pieces from boxes to vases! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANTIQUE LIMOGES AT HOME!"
2,Would Not Fit On My Bike,"The bottle is extra large, so make sure you have enough room on your bike to attach this. Additionally, there are not directions on how to affix to the bike frame, and if your frame is oversized (not round, but ovals) you'll have trouble (as I did) attaching this to your bike.Good price... but I can't use it on my bike."
5,A nice gift book,This is a re-issue of a classic work. Makes a wonderful gift book for young adults and beyond.
1,"There are only 12 tracks on this $36.00 CD, not 24","I have always loved the Breakfast at Tiffany's soundtrack, and I have had it on vinyl for years. I wanted to get a CD copy so I could listen to it on my iPod, and I was really excited about getting this version of the CD because the track list says it has the whole Breakfast at Tiffany's soundtrack as well as one for Arabesque, with a whopping 24 songs.Well, the CD actually only has the 11 original soundtrack songs for B at T's, plus one bonus song. The remaining songs are nowhere to be seen or heard. I didn't mind paying extra for this because I thought I was getting two albums on one CD. I really like the paper cover and I didn't want to create more waste and use more resources by mailing the CD back to Amazon, so I just kept it."
4,SPENSER BOOK THIRTEEN,"TAMING A SEA-HORSE is not my favorite Spenser book, but it is my thirteenth and I will certainly go on to fourteen and the rest. Love the series and Spenser, Hawk, and Susan are a great team This story bring back in, April Kyle, prostituting in NYC. Spenser comes to find out why she is working for a new pimp and things go deadly wrong. Story is good, but not as good as a lot of the preceding books. RECOMMENDED."
5,Very easy to install. Durable and nice design.,"Quality you can trust from Leviton. Easy to install, durable, and nice design. Perfect for 'round' lamp cords. If you have a round lamp cord then this is probably the only one you'll find. I looked and looked all over the place. Get this one and save time!"
2,PowerStop Rotors,"The rotor was great and the person I purchased it from was great... I received it in 1/2 the posted time. Five Stars....On the other hand,The Manufacture ""PowerStop Rotors"" was not helpful regarding a rotor issue and I will never purchase another rotor from PowerStop the Manufacture... Horrible Customer Service Issues..."
2,u missed the point...,"The two other reviewers completely missed the point of this. ""This compilation is an insult to everything Nirvana stood for, and completely misses the point of the entire grunge movement. If you can't deal with the harsh rock sound, go pick up a Kenny G album because Nirvana is not for you."" This is a cd for the true nirvana fan with a sense of humor (like my Ramones tribute cd done by japanese bands). It's obivously not looking to replace your old nirvana cd's, it's just a way to look at them differently. Also, it can come in handy when you want to give granma something to listen."
2,Twilight Healer,"Amnesia and work related hassles become the least of Leslie's worries when she discovers she has become a vampire. Though this has some advantages, among them a healing gift, the need for blood and the facts that she is now part of a centuries old war with other vampires and demonic deities of legend are drawbacks. To have the man she has come to love, to have a life, she mustThis is certainly not the usual vampire novel. Bringing together elements never before mixed, Ms. Custer creates a unique setting in which other worlds are only a heartbeat away, or less if your heart no longer beats."
5,Volume 2,"""The long-awaited sequel to the best-selling My First Time continues the tradition of true, first-person accounts by gay men of their first, sexual encounter with another man. Sometimes shocking, sometimes kinky, sometimes sweet, sometimes troubling, these stories let the teller peel away the years in his own way. Each recollection evokes the trembling, heart-pounding, sweaty-palmed, blood-racing excitement that accompanies that first trip down the road of carnal knowledge. Whether you laugh or squirm or find your own heart beating a little faster, this new volume of My First Time is sure to bring back memories.""-- zebraz"
5,excellent work,"It is an excellent work,necessary for neurosurgeons interested in functional neurosurgery and for neuroradiologists. However i don't think it would be useful to someone else because it would be very advanced and specialized."
5,Very Nice Book!,"it was in very good condition, only read it a couple of times but I need to get back in the habit anyways, we used to ready every night"
3,LeMaster Method of Waterfowl Identification,"This works best if you have the bird in hand. It doesn'thelp as much for ducks on the fly,"
5,A must for the duck hunter,"This booklet is for the duck hunter, not a PETA activist. The duck needs to be in your hand so you can match the bill and feet to the pictures for accurate ID. This is an excellant booklet for waterfowl ID."
4,Great identifier guide but poor construction of the book,"This is a great little book to keep in your blind bag, but the durability is terrible. I blame the publisher and not the author of course. The pages are very thin and tear easily. The pages also tear away from the cheap plastic binding really easily as well. The information inside is great for beginner duck hunters and is a great way to accurately identify your daily bag. I recommend taking off the spiral binding and laminating the pages that you will use most. Then use a hole punch and a small key ring to keep them together. Again, the consumer should never have to do that, but the book itself if very useful for a waterfowler just starting out and definatley worth it."
1,Terrible!!,Couldn't finish this book it was so bad. This book is just a watered down version of the original.
1,Disappointing,"I found this book very disappointing. I can't believe that the so-called reviewers actually read the book, because if they did, they couldn't have rated it this high. It is disjointed, poorly organized, and makes very little sense. I found it hard to understand exactly what this guy thought was a good investment. He also ignored many of the obviously collectible bikes that are out there now-- H2 Kawasakis, Sand-cast 750 Hondas, the Italian lightweights of the 50s and 60s, etc. I was not all that impressed with the author's knowledge of bikes or their values whatsoever. Beyond that, the writing and copy editing on this thing was beyond amateur. My 12 year-old knows more about sentence structure and punctuation!"
1,agonizingly painful to read,"This author is completely overdramatizing situations which makes the book unrealistic. I am a student taking every AP class available, president of clubs, and associated in many others. Guess what? I don't have these issues in the book and I dont know any other students suffering from it either. If the student is genuinely smart and concerned about college they can educate themselves on a little thing called ""time management"""
4,This book is for you. And you. And you....,"Alexandra Robbins makes a compelling case for parents and their children to reexamine success and prestige in her latest expose. This book should be on all parents' must-read list, especially if you have kids in middle school who are already worried about their ""resumes"" and private college counselors."
1,Absolutely Useless,"All this book is good for is if you want to cite sources with absolutely no actual writing style to it what so ever. If you really want to format a paper, check out Chicago writing style. That, at least, allows much flexibility for a paper and has a logical way to format the paper and bibliography. I have to use this book for formatting all my papers for all my college classes and every time I have found this absolutely useless. After having to write a paper in MLA, APA, and Chicago writing styles, this looks like it was ment for elementary and middle school student use."
5,mj ??,i think michael jackson is the coolest person around!!!! i think he is the best and i have liked him scince i was 5! If you want to e-mail me then it is SRScomp@aol.com
3,disappointing,"Growing up in Brooklyn in the 1950's, my Father's radio was always tuned to WEVD (or WQXR). As such, I expected more of the lingua franca that the CD purports to contain. Enlish ditties sung by Jewish personalities is cute but not enthralling. I kept waiting to hear actual Yiddish and especially the voice of Zvi Scooler. I cannot imagine any collection of this sort not containing the voice of Zcooler. Maybe I expected too much."
5,"Good price, look good, work well!","I'm guessing the ""snagless"" refers to the tall curves on either side of the clip on the ends of the cable. These tall tabs on both sides of the clip make it rather difficult to push the clip down when removing the cable, at least in tight places where you're limited in how you can twist your hand. Meh, no big deal. The price is good, the black looks really darn good, and they do their job just fine!"
4,"Good, but the Plastic Tips Broke Easily",I got this cord for under $5 and it lasted almost a year before the plastic ends broke. I unplugged and replugged it in one or more time a day and was satisfied with it for how much abuse I put it through.
1,Bait and Switch,"They sent a different product. Does not say that is made by Belkin anywhere on it. They sent me a RJ45 cable made by FOXXCONN #E204149. This does not have the protected cover 'snagless' over the release lever, as shown in the picture/item description. I'm not happy; I do not plan to buy from this company again....."
1,NOTHING like dragon ball z,I saw this heaping pile of poop the day it came out because my friend made us watch it. He will live with the stigma until the day he dies. !!!
2,meh,"Nothing special here. Nothing atrocious either. This movie is decidedly ho-hum. The flashback scenes of fantastical ancient times were cool, but short-lived. CGI makes even low budget effects look decent and this is no exception. The movie on the whole has the quality level of a made for sci-fi channel flick. It's ok for a rainy afternoon where your outdoor plans fall through but I wouldn't ever PLAN to watch a movie of this calibre. I didnt pause this movie when I got up fro a drink or bio break... I just didn't care enough about it and didn't want it to last longer than necessary. Don't pay more than a few bucks to watch this thing."
3,"This is.... well, something, that's for sure.","This movie was so bad it almost made me ask for my money back. I can't explain why I love it, though. It wasn't Godzilla bad, not even Gamera bad. It was just plain, out and out, bad. There were rocket launcher toting slugs and acting so painful I needed an aspirin. But, it was fun.My friend and I were alone in the theater so we made fun of it at every turn. From LOLDragons ('It eats me!' and 'I'm in your city, eating your reincarnated virgins!') to pop culture to inside jokes, we made fun of this movie and had a wonderful time. (At one point we broke out into Fett's Vett by M.C. Chris. It just seemed to fit.)Watching the movie a second time just wasn't as funny. But the first time was such fun, we didn't even ask for our money back. We're waiting to pick up a copy so we can inflict this pain upon a new audience, an audience which needs punished but not killed. D-Wars should do the trick."
3,waiting to see it...,"i saw the trailer in the theater, but never got to see the movie, most reviews say it is bad, but by the preview i want to see it for myself... so i just pre-ordered it and will update this review when i see it.. any movie with monsters is going to be o.k. and make plenty of money if this whole cloverfield thing takes off.. i also noticed that the dvd will be 90 minutes on imdb website it lists a european version (in theaters) running at 107 minutes--i wonder if it will be re-released like everything else on dvd today....."
2,Horrible Film,This was the worst film I have ever sat through. Very bad storyline and it was just a waste of time. Do not watch this.
1,What a waste of time,"I am still amazed that I actually spent 1 hours watching this movie. The story is nothing but a collage of badly pasted flashbacks that make no sense at all. The characters are lame and the poor acting worsens the situation. CGI is not anything special at all. In summary, some films are so bad they actually make you laugh - this one is just pathetic. Spend your $20 on some teletubby DVD... it has to be more entertaining than this."
1,So bad,"While some of the visual effects were compelling towards the end, the story was just so so bad that it made it next to impossible to watch. It felt like several random video game plot lines all mashed into one. Half the time I couldn't even figure out where the characters WERE! Especially towards the end. Was it a giant cave or something? The final dragon was very well done visually but it is NOT worth sitting through it. Funnily enough it felt a lot like Transformers which I also hated. . ."
4,the previews didn't lie.,"Dragon Wars - D-Warthis is an excellent film! Our main characters try to escape from a beast that will never stop. There is so much action and destruction that you just cannot take it all in, even in slow motion. If you don't have a blue-ray player, buy one now and blow your friends away with this movie. I should've given it five stars -- I know you will."
4,Enjoyable movie,"Yes, you could say it is a tribute to many other movies as mentionedin previous reviews. Personally I enjoyed this movie much morethan a whole lot of other ones out there.If you can sit back and relax then you might too.If you are the kind of person who critiques every detail then write/direct a better mousetrap."
2,Movie is Terrible,"I own a ton of movies, and love any sort of CG movie, but this one is the dumbest movie I that I have ever watched. I'm disappointed that I bought it. But it worked, which says a lot since its a Blu-Ray."
1,HORRIBLE MOVIE,ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER!!don't buy this movie the acting and plot is stupid retarded. On blu ray it's sooo real it's fake either that or the movie was just that bad.
2,Dragon Wars Blu-ray,Dragon Wars - D-War [Blu-ray] Though not one of the best movies on dragons I collected this movie for entertainment value and the fact that it originated in the Orient.
2,You'll Want More Than Just Your Change Back With This,"I love the song We Built This City on Rock n' Roll. Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now and Sara are also pretty good. I anticipated the other songs being at least all right as I do not remember any other Starship songs however I was pretty young then so I thought I might have missed some gems. I was wrong, apart from those three songs the rest are very average and it is hard to imagine these were actually hits let alone their greatest. You will find the three big songs on many an 80's compilation album so just buy those instead."
4,Petrodex Inconsistent Packaging,"We have been using the Petrodex product for a long time. Our dog loves it and we do not have any problem brushing his teeth. The problem is the material that the tube is made of: it's like old-fashioned metal toothpaste tube which is very hard to squeeze, especially the last few times. The product was shipped to us once, with a plastic tube which was very convenient to handle; but this last time it reverted back to the old tube. I wish they could consistently use the plastic material."
3,Dog kinda seems to like it,I previously bought the peanut butter version and my pitbull loved it. She likes this one I think but not as much as the peanut butter toothpaste so I would recommend that one instead
5,Dogs Favorite toothpaste,Used this product for years and it makes it easier brushing their teeth because they love it.
5,Good taste,"My dogs love the taste of this product and lick the toothbrush once I lay it down. The only problem is getting them used to the brushing action, as I never get to raise a dog from puppyhood, but always from middle age."
2,Overpriced material...,"The cost of this book is too high considering the content. The book has usable information for us in the nonparametric area of study but does not provide extensive benefits beyond that of an internet search. Overall, save your money and search online."
2,Russian (aka post Soviet) propaganda machine still at work,"Great, thrilling movie. Short on real Orthodox Christian monastic reality. Has little to do with real prayer or asceticism, or clairevoyent elder(ship). Like the utterly fabricated Fr. Arseny novel (fic-bioraphy) the agenda coming out of Moscow and Sretensky Monastery (Abbott Tikhon) is pure Soviet propoganda. All is well in the NEW HOLY RUSSIA INC. Trouble is it's just too pat, too prepared, and not really warm with the truth of Christ's holy Truth or Historical Martyric Orthodoxy."
1,VGA adapter,The adapter was not the correct size for a 2009 Mac book pro. There was no indication on the description to indicate it was for the earlier models.
2,i wonder if it works.,very cheep made.the actual picture looks so different from the picture on package.and focus too much on abs.i wonder this exercise can shape your body.
4,"Very charming, except when dusting","I'm not a clean freak, but these charming, whimsical bookends have a slight liability: dust collects between the fingers and it becomes a nuisance to clean them. The dust doesn't wisk away with a swipe of micro-fiber. You actually have to slide a duster between each finger. But, if you don't worry about a bit of dust, or only have a few bookends and it isn't a big deal, these are great bookends. Since I have a couple of thousand books and dozens of bookends, it's more noticeable to me, though not all of my bookends are this style. But they are awfully cute!"
4,Help for parents,This book has great illustratrions and includes both common & obscure words/signs. It is a very user-friendly & encouraging resource even for new parents!
3,LIKE BOOGIE ON TUESDAY,"In LIKE BOOGIE ON TUESDAY, four individuals (Tim, Nina, Troi and Vaughn) are searching for the perfect relationship, one that meets their physical, spiritual and emotional needs. Each one is carrying a lot of old family baggage and unresolved issues.This book discusses the consequences of unprotected sex in both homosexual and heterosexual encounters, and the very real connection to sexually transmitted diseases.LIKE BOOGIE ON TUESDAY was full of emotional contradictions, for every way the protagonists felt strongly about themselves, when the need for action occurred, they reacted in almost opposite fashion.This book really needs to be professionally edited. There were far too many glaring errors in sentence structure, spelling and punctuation. Those errors took away from an already mediocre book."
4,good writing and character development,"I did not finish the book becuase the subject matter was something I was not interested in. I think because I lived a life like that in my twenties. I really did not want to repeat the past or read about it. However, I do think that Ms. Grosvenor is a wonderful writer. The characters were so close to home for me. I knew several men just like the character who had no time for women and only for their career. I made a fool of myself with these types. I know it sounds silly to say that I could not read abook just because of something akin to very mild Post tramatic stress syndrome. I guess I just don't want to remember and would rather read comedies and books that are more a new experience for me. Again I say though, this lady does know how to write. Kuddos!"
5,Oklahoma! is GRAND,"I saw this production twice when it came to Oklahoma City on it's way to Broadway. It is the best yet, and this CD captures the energy of that show very well. All of the performers are first rate and the memory of the cast singing ""OKLAHOMA!"" up to the footlights still sends chills down my spine. Since the recording was made when LP's still reigned, there are some cuts, but all in all, a very satisfying recording. It's too bad this production wasn't preserved on video."
1,tiny screen,"I bought this toy so my baby would leave me working on my laptop but the design of the screen was not attractive.. it is small, black and white with very old technology that did not attract the baby away from my laptop.. Such defects was not obvious in the product page.. I do not recommend this toy if you are intending to use it as a replacement for playing with your real laptop! your baby is smarter than that"
3,great toy for a while,i brought this for my two year son because his older cousins had laptops. it was great at first until after repeated use the mouse wouldn't work which controls how you get to the programs. i would love to know why they didn't include arrows to get to the games but thats my only gripe with the toy so buyer beware.
4,"Great toy, bad graphics!","My 3-yr-old son loves this toy and can play with it for hours. He still can only do about 1/3 of the games, but that's okay because it will grow with him. I love the variety of games - uppercase, lower case letters, music, numbers, etc. My only complaint is that the graphics are terrible. They look like something from the 80s! However, it doesn't seem to bother my little one, just me. Other than that, great toy (if you don't mind some noise!)"
5,This One's A Keeper!,"My 3 year old got this for Christmas and she loves it. It looks like Mommy's computer and she can use it instead of trying to ""help"" me with mine. The screen is a little small and it's not color, but my daughter doesn't seem to notice or care.There are a variety of games and exercises to try ranging from easy to hard, so it will hopefully keep her attention for a while yet. Some of the games are geared toward learning to use a ""real"" PC or laptop, such as games to control the mouse, etc. Others are more for learning alphabets/numbers/phonetics and things of that nature. I can't tell you all of them because, honestly, we haven't tried them all yet. There is a little room for improvement (with the size of the screen, etc.) but that being said, we're into February now and she is still playing with this on a daily basis so they must have gotten something right!"
4,waiting for my son to grow into it,"We bought this for my 3.5 yr old son. I like the laptop for all of the different games. Seems very sturdy despite being knocked around. It would be nice if the mouse stayed attached in it's spot. Instead it falls off easily and just hangs via the rubber wire. The screen does not light up so the black animation is hard to see if we are in dim light.With a few weeks practice, my son has gotten the hang of a few of the basic games. He quickly gets frustrated with the activites that are more advanced and gives up easily. I expect his interest will grow as he gets a little older."
1,I really hate this toy!,"I had high hopes for this toy because the reviews were mostly positive, but I was very disappointed. I think it's hard to navigate and the graphics are horrible. The music is tolerable, and that's about it!"
2,Laptop is fine but my daughter never liked it (she is 11 months),"We bought this when my daughter was 10 months old. Our expectation was she would love to paly with its keys and different sounds, however in reality she spent just a few mins with it on the first day and never touched it again. We are hoping she would start liking it when she grows older and if she does, I may have to change this review :)"
1,shop around first,"I just bought this for my grandson as his ""big"" Christmas present...then saw the same toy for $20 less at Target today. Very disappointing--I thought amazon.com was competitively priced. I guess not."
1,Not what I expected,"My first disappointment was the set up of the keyboard. With our times of technology and the daily use of computers for everything I was not exceptionally happy with the non-qwerty set up of the keyboard. I do understand the why someone would think the set-up of the keyboard and placement of the letters is a good idea for the purpose of learning the letters in order, however, this also means when they go to use a real keyboard they will need to relearn the placement of letters as this is not a qwerty-style keyboard. My son is only 2 but we've been teaching him letters on his own keyboard since he was 18 months old. Due to this it will only lead to confusion. This was a big reason I sent it back.The second disappointment was the size of the screen. Like I said, I sent this back and found other toys that taught the same concepts, without the task of re-teaching my son a different way once he is older."
3,"I guess for the money, it's OK.","I purchased this for a 2 year old. She had fun with it for the first 10 minutes...and then moved on. I guess for the money spent, it's ok. Would I do it over again? Probably not. Maybe when she gets a little older she'll have more fun with it. I wasn't happy about the tiny B&W screen."
3,OK for price,"The games are decent, durability is good. My daughter bored of it rather quickly. Can't turn volume off."
2,Meh.... Not a hit,"My 2.5 Year Old daughter got this last xmas. we figured that punching the buttons would entertain her on a LONG car trip for Christmas. She could still care less. She is obsessed with our laptop, but doesn't like this one. The mouse is very annoying, its too easy to switch games and modes so when she does play with it, its just annoying. We are going to try getting her the leap frog one this year. I even tried putting it away for 6 months, and still she could care less. But she's not really into electronic toys in general."
5,VTECH Rules!,"In my humble opinion, VTech is ""the BEST"" educational toy company out there. We have never been let down by the quality, thoughtfulness and talent that goes into making VTech toys. Both my children, one autistic (age 4) and the other not (age 2) are learning and having fun every time they turn on any of their creative learning devices. Another great company for electronic learning toys is LeapFrog -- also very nice products."
1,Leave the batteries out,"Better for pretending than doing. My daughter likes to pretend she's on a laptop like mommy or daddy. But the graphics are horrible. She's mastered many games on the iPod touch though.Any activity on this would involve the game of guessing what those black and white dots are supposed to represent.For the parents, the music is loud, annoying and doesn't shut off for several minutes after the child has walked away from the toy.The durability is good, unfortunately."
4,My girls love their laptops,"We received the first laptop 2 years ago and then another one on Christmas so luckily, my girls don't have to fight over it. My soon-to-be 4 year old is just starting to like using it more because she's learned to use the mouse on our PC so it's easy for her to use it on the laptop. My only complaint is that the mouse doesn't stay in place so it's hard for her to use it in the car, which would be ideal. If there were a way to lock it into place, that would have been great. Other than that, she learns a little more everyday and I love to hear her get excited when she gets something right. My 2 1/2 year old likes to push the buttons but she doesn't understand it too much. But, she will in time. (I've had no trouble with them breaking. I think they're pretty durable.)"
3,"Okay, just Not what expected.","Have another of Karen Therese's cd's and this one is very different. Some songs are..well, rather explicit. Not really to our liking. I bought it for my husband(at his request) and he only liked about half the songs on the CD."
1,Not like Patterson,"This book does not read as earlier Cross books did. Dialogue, love scenes, action, all seem odd. Further, he maligns policemen and particularly the United States Army. His outrageous portrayal of soldiers who served in Vietnam is right from John Kerry. Plus he writes of things Vietnamese, such as voodoo doll images, that simply aren't true. Forget reading this book, much less buying it."
3,Soooooo..,This product fit what I was looking for but I wish the price was a little bit lower. I still liked the product though.
3,Don't like it.,"It sits too close to the window. It doesn't stick out far enough to give any real support. I suppose if your door is closer to the driver than in my Ford Ranger, it might be of use. In my case, it's mainly my elbow that rests on it, not my entire arm.UPDATE: I can tell you that I'm adding to this review as of Nov 2012. This thing has held up well, and shows no real signs of deterioration. Since I couldn't use it, I gave it to my wife, and she's been using it ever since. I find the material slightly irritating on exposed skin. I really just wish it was a different material, but I suppose that material is what's making it last so long!"
1,Bad luck,I purchased the card for a wedding of one of my sons. We were able to take well over 400 pictures and 4 or 5 videos with the card. Unfortunately while downloading the data the card became corrupt and I had to DL some software to retrieve the data. This may have been a card hardware error or a software glitch. None the less this was just bad luck. I sent the card back without any problem. Maybe I will have better luck next time.
5,Works fine no complains,"The xD picture cards are expensive and confusing as compared to SD or compact Flash cards.This one just works fine, no lag in taking pictures, what else is there to a memory card."
5,I finally have enough room!,"Yay! An xD-Picture card that can handle as many images as I can take in one outing. The only downside is that none of my multicard readers can read it. I must plug my camera in to download the photos, but I can live with that for the added memory. Well worth the purchase."
1,Bad Items,"The item comes seal but , did not work, I will retuned it .The shippind was good .Very bad deal."
5,From a Novice Fuji S5000 Owner...A good investment,"My Fuji S5000 came with a 16MB card as standard so I could take a total of just 9 pictures at the highest resolution of 3MP. Alternatively, I could record about 26 seconds of video with sound until the 'Card Full' message came on. Not too practical as you can imagine.Anyway, I finally upgraded and I can say without a doubt that the 512MB card is a great value by any standard. Now I can use the video mode for more than 14 minutes OR take about 350 high resolution (3MP) photos!!! Not awesome but still a great capacity especially for someone who wants to experiment with all the features today's digicams have.As a side note, I have not seen a 1GB card but that would definitely be on my shopping list if and when it is released."
4,Very Good! A MUST have!,I've been reading this series since they came out and own all of the books B.B. has written for it. This is by far one of my FAVS and proves horses do understand whats going on and can be one of your closest alies! I also recomend the THOROUGHBRED series though there are some story line flaws they are also a must have!
2,I don't know........,"A small improvement from #75. I love the cover bu the book, well. I think these books reley to heavely on snobs for the plots. Seesh, I mean, how many Veronicas can you have? The fact that Lisa, being a ""great"" horsewoman would do something as stupid as not paying atention to where she was going is just, humph. I hate how Mrs.Bryant adds charcters and then never talks about them again, like the new boy in this book, whats-his-name. If Max is so strict why does he let the Saddle CLub around on such a lose rein? Oh well, at least Mrs.Bryant did another horse/rider bond in this book."
4,a good white tea,"Good flavor. Small, needle like leaves occasionally turn up in your cup (hence the lower rating than the other teas I've reviewed) if you don't use a good strainer when you pour it out of the teapot (it, like all looseleaf teas, works best in a teapot or infuser mug). A very good tea, nice and mild."
4,Great Teaching Tool,"This book will provide a music teacher with a tremendous amount of examples for the student to work through. Although it explains how to read rhythms, I would not recommend it for someone who knows nothing about reading rhythmic notation. Rather, the working through of this book should be supervised by a music teacher who has extensive experience reading music. I use it with almost all my guitar students and they develop a tremendously precocious understanding of rhythm which helps them learn everything else at a much faster pace than the average student."
3,Camping Mama,"I love the look of this~ however it is not quite tall enough to hold a normal size hand towel for the bathroom (even on the taller side). We will keep this, but beware that the size is misleading. Overall we liked it."
4,OOPS,CD itself was satisfactory - however the cd case was cracked - since it did not impact the cd itself I decided against returning it.
4,"Great, Late Nell Carter","What a shame that Nell Carter didn't do more theater or sing more than she did. I would have loved to have seen and heard her do more. An incredible voice. How sad that she passed so young. I had the pleasure of meeting her and talking with her at length in 1984, and she was as warm and charming as could be. A lovely woman."
1,This Album is Lame,"I am sorry there is no option for zero stars, but one was as few as I could select. This ""music"" gave me a headache, as it sounded like a convulsion in a cookware factory. I am sure the appearance of this atrocity on an LP encouraged legions of talentless garage scum to aspire to their own albums, another reason to hate this one. Real musical instruments were optional, evidently, as was musical ability."
1,"Abilene Town (1946) "" Enhanced""","Avoid this at ALL costs. The disc is a DVDr, the insert, a cheap paper photocopy, the picture quality 3rd rate VHS at best. To call this "" Enhanced "" is beyond laughable. No way should this be sold through Amazon, it's just a cheap bootleg and should be removed immediately. To add insult to injury, this is priced a lot higher than other versions of the title ( the reason I was duped into buying it ). I'll sign off now, I'm just going to the Post Office to return it."
5,outstanding performances,"the sound of this cd is poor (but not unbearable), the quality of playing is outstanding. These are interpretations of unsurpassed beauty, unmatched by any modern ( and old) recording. It is sufficient to listen to the forward momentum mantained by the players in the 2nd movement (andante, ma moderato) of the difficult Brahms sextet to be aware of listening to something magical, an unique musical experience."
3,Weak pressure,"For some reason, I thought 2 burners could both run on high, but it seems like this can only run 1 on high or 2 on medium. This actually works for a crawfish boil, but not a lobster bake."
3,It Stopped Talking After 4 Days,"I thought that the ball was great until it stopped talking after only 4 days; I wrote the company but received no response. The ball kept my mastiff puppy very amused as it talked to him. When the voice stopped, the ball was really no good anymore. I purchased it because it talked. The ball really should be played with outside because it is made of very hard plastic and could do alot of damage in the house if it hits the furniture."
4,babble ball for birds too!,I love this little babble ball and though its for a dog my bird loves it and have heard other bird owners say the same thing about them. Not just for dogs!
5,Talking Babbling Dog Toy,I bought this toy for my dog and she plays with it when she can find it. It will babble & talk all of the time that it is rolled around the house. She thinks someone is inside of the ball as it talks to her. Funny.
1,Not a safe toy!,"Our dogs weigh about 15 pounds and this ball got SHARP points on it as they played with it. Tiny pieces came off and got in their fur and probably down their throat. Not safe!!! The babbling part was great. They loved it for the short time they were allowed to play with it. I returned them--and requested a refund for the unused ones. A great idea for a toy, but it must be made safer."
5,love this ball,"we got this ball for our destructive puppy and he loved it. he's 12 lb's and a schnoodle and the medium size was perfect for him. Just big enough where he could still grab it with his mouth(with some difficulty) despite the hard material. We got a blue color. The talking is very cool; I didn't follow instructions :( and I threw out a tab that activates the battery. so, this thing was babbling more then it should have when he wasn't even around. Because of this the battery ran out after about 2 weeks or so. before that he loved hearing a voice from this and got into the habit of 'throwing' it with his front paws to fling it across the room (picture a kick with his front paws). This was of course adorable to see and he loved it. So, great toy, remember to keep the battery tab."
3,Disappearing voice,"Purchased this talking ball on July 30, 2010. My Newfie LOVED it but she's forlorn now, beseeching me with those big eyes to FIX IT, MOM, since that funny, funny voice is no more.... So it lasted only about one week. Fool that I am, I'll probably order it again, though, since it was such great fun while it lasted."
3,My dog,I love it but my dog hasn't played with it since I first purchased it. He runs into every now and again and just looks at it. I think it amuses me more than him.
3,Alright,"At first my 6 month old lab mix was petrified of it, but we put it in a long soccer sock so it has a tail like effect, muffles the volume a tad and has a softer/friendlier appearance and now he won't leave it alone! Will definitely need to limit the amount of time he gets to 'kill the sock' per day. Not sure if its worth $10 since it is just a hard plastic ball that rotates between 6 annoying phrases, but ill rethink that statement on a rainy day when he is bouncing off the walls and needs something to occupy him in the house :-)"
1,Both of my dogs don't care for this toy,"I thought at least one of my dogs would like this ball, but neither one is interested in it. I roll it around and they just don't care. Oh well..."
4,Awesome!,"I bought one of these and it is great. I think it is hilarious and fun to watch our dog push it around to hear the sounds. As for the batteries, all i can say is that the dollar stores around our area have $1 laser pointers that come with these batteries. So for a dollar you get a pointer and batteries for the ball. Love it!"
1,no good,I ordered 2 of these and one arrived talking in the box....did not work after 1 day. The other worked for about 3 days. Would be nice if it actually lasted.
2,Not worth the money!!,I either got a defective product or this thing just sucks. I was thinking this was a soft rubber type but its a very hard plastic. My dog isn't interested in this at all and its it heavy and annoying for my cat to enjoy. I will be returning this product. If you're interested in toys that will keep your animals entertained try the Premire treat toys.
4,great toy,"wish the dog would like it instead of bark at it, but does chase it and then barks at it and that is all"
3,My dog wont go near it.,"The ball absolutey scared my puppy. She is a 7 month old vizshla and didn't want to step foot in the room the bal had been in for a long time. I hope it will wear on her and maybe, with the help of some treats, I can get her to like it. Otherwise, it was a waste."
3,Dreams of another Lowry book fell a bit short of expectations,"Love Lois Lowry...I read the original three in this series with my 7th graders each year...will be adding Son, as well. Gossamer just ended too abruptly. The story, imagery, and delightful dream givers were all top notch Lowry, but when I got to the last word, ""Gossamer."" I kept trying to turn to the next page on my iPad version of the book. Actually thought there was something wrong with the darn thing. I recommend the book, but wish the ending had just a little more to offer."
4,A soulful look at dreams,Lois Lowery has a talent for creating a new world to explain the unexplainable aspects of our world. Great book.
1,EEEEWWW!!!,"SWEENY TODD IS NASTY! THE STORY IS WEIRD, THE SINGING IS WORST! IT'S JUST LIKE THE ROCKY HORROR SHOW. THEY BOTH ARE STUIPED ""HORROR"" MUSICALS THAT EVERYONE CALLS ""A HIT"". IF YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO A GOOD BROADWAY CD, I SAY YOU SHOULD LSITEN TO JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR (ORIGINAL BROADWAY OR LONDON CAST RECORDINGS"", OR LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS (NEW BROADWAY CAST). DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS CD. ANYWAY,SWEENY TODD IS AGAIN NASTY! DID YOU SEE THAT SCENE WHEN HE CUT THAT GUY'S HEAD OFF? TOTTALLY GROSS."
1,Is Amazon Thrift Store?,"I ordered new one, and received all broken, used and surely returned item from somebody. Asked replacement, and they answered yes. I waited for new one and was notified they're gonna refund it.I contact customer service on phone, and he told me he's processing replacement.You know what? It's refunded! Huh!I felt so bad twice for one order. They wasted my time!I sent a all complain e-mail, and they just said 'sorry'.What a shameful sorry-ness!"
4,Kent marine reef carbon,"This carbon works very well and is highly activated. It provides sparkling clear water and superior flow rate, much better than cheap mega store charcoal products."
2,A simple book for the beginner; not much substance,"I picked up a couple ideas from this book, but it really doesn't offer much practical information for the intermediate or advanced Web designer. Of course, if you don't understand the difference between a GIF and a JPEG then perhaps this book is a good place to start. One thing I thought was annoying was the fact that the book splits its time (and pages) explaining how to make graphics with Photoshop and PhotoPaint so, unless you use both, there's a lot of useless info"
2,Missing pages!,"I dont know if this is a fluke but i'm missing pages 178, 180, 188, 196, 204, 211. it's really difficult to follow along in my class when I dont know what page we're on."
5,Tests your imagination,This book was just like the first. If you enjoyed the first one then I would most definitely look into purchasing this one. This book is great if you have free time and just want to sit and think about things. It is perfect for reading with a group of friends or a significant other. Some of the questions are absolutely ridiculous and will result in a lot of laughter. I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys imagining themselves in crazy scenarios. I would buy it again.
2,Too Bad.,"The product is a good one, as described.My one rating is for the customer service.Shipment of my order took well over a month with many inquires as to my order status.Each inquire was responded to, but there was sparse order status communication from the vendor.If you don't mind delay, the vendor has a good range of products and did eventually complete my order.w"
4,Dreamworld,"After listening first to the songs on mp3, then buying the cd, the sound quality is much better. Audio Fantasy has been one of my favs, and liked the improvements in the track. The mixing of each song goes hand in hand. 303 is out to do his own thing and that is what he did, brilliantly I may add. 303 takes you out on a journey through a dreamworld, and you won't be disappointed. People that enjoyed the mp3's will enjoy the CD much more. People first tuning in are in for a new experience."
4,A fresh perspective of hydrology,"Global Hydrology is distinct from the other Hydrology books in the sense that it clearly shows the signifcance of Hydrology as related to the real-world problems. There are no long derivations and governing equations; rather, it focuses on the processes and develops an understanding of the underlying physics. The chapters relating to environmental aspects are particularly appealing."
3,Turn off to Teens,"Although the book is a wealth of information and suggestions to teens, the volume of reading in each chapter is a turn off. At least to my teens, who enjoy reading but at this time in their lives prefer to socialize with their friends outside of our home, read books that interest and selected by them and certainly not behind their bedroom door reading how crazy they and their parents are. They know know that already! When I ordered the book, I was expecting it to be a short version/ cliff notes version of Mr. Bradley's companion book, "" Yes, your teen is crazy"". I was a bit disappointed."
4,Brains like ours.....,"I read Bradley's books ""Yes Your Teen is Crazy"" and ""Yes Your Parents are Crazy"", when researching my own book ""The Owner's Guide to the Teenage Brain"". ""Yes Your Parents are Crazy"" is one of the few books on teenage brains addressed to the teenagers themselves (like ""The Owner's Guide to the Teenage Brain"") as most are addressed to exasperated parents. Both books provide knowledge about what is happening in these important years, and as a pair, allow kids and parents to read about the changes in partnership -you could do this in some kind of pact to reduce tensions in your relationships.Recommended.Derek Pugh"
3,"Perfect, but not special","It looks OK, but it isn't really something special. I think, that fot a young girl it fits, but for a woman, which wants to look different, it doesn't"
2,Should have listened to the rest.,"A gift to my wife ""just because"" she loved the way they felt and weighted not how they ""creep up"" and stay there. She does not use them as much as she would like. Don't buy them you will be sad :("
5,Well made mini everyday carry.,"Great every day tool. Well made.The black metal finish seems to wear very well, and has not been eroded due to use or friction when cutting."
5,Sweet without the Sugar,"This tea is great. I usually stick with Numi brand Red Mellow Bush because of the health benefit, but this one has a better, wonderful sweet taste. It doesn't need any milk or honey. What a wonderful beverage to keep the weight off and still enjoy a nice taste without the high fructose corn syrup."
3,DVD player,"For less than thirty dollars, this is a great little DVD player; controls are all very easy to operate, the remote controller is excellent, well laid out and the buttons are not all the same size and shape so that makes it easier to find the one button you're looking for.Obviously this isn't a high-end component but it works very well in a dorm or barracks environment."
1,really bad quality,"i work for fred meyer, and we get atleast 3 of these back everyday. there is a reason they are cheap, its because they are garbage."
3,Wrong Model Number,"I placed my order for the Coby DVD - 224, expecting it to comply with all the specs listed on the Web page...well the unit I got has the DVD-224 model tag but the manual received was for the DVD - 224M... Guess what?? it does not play MP3 CD's... I wrote amazon asking for clarification and the answer I got was to ship it back and ask for my money back.. sounds fine, but not so!! I happen to live in south america (the unit was ordered through a forwarder in Florida) and shipping cost plus taxes sum up to more than $50 USD.. sending it back was going to be as expensive... So I just decided to keep it (but I am not happy anyway!!).By the way the page, as of today, one month later, the Amazon page still list the unit as MP3 compatible..."
1,BROKE AFTER 3 MONTHS!!!!,"I bought this player couple of months before. It worked fine for the past 3 months. But from last week the DVD player just shows ""loading..."" when I load a DVD and it just stays there forever. When I went to the Coby web site to read about the warranty, I found that the warranty is only for 90 days. If you want an inexpensive DVD player try Cyberhome, I had better experience with that. This player really sucks!!!"
1,Didn't work after a few days,"The dvd player stopped working after just a few days of playing dvd's. The player will not load any dvd's and simply says ""No Disc"" The manufacturer's shipping and handling fees are close to the same as a new unit without any hope that the new one would be any better. Despite the low cost it is definitely not worth it."
4,great little system,"It does the job. Easy setup, reads all kinds of disc. I would buy another one as a replacement or backup player. A great buy!"
2,Stopped Working After Six Months - Disposable,"We purchased this item as an inexpensive replacement for anAudiovox D1705 Portable DVD Player with 7-Inch LCDwhich recently died.Setup was quick and easy. The player has S-video and progressive scan outputs. The remote takes some getting used to.We now get a ""Wrong Disc"" error message from the unit. It is not worth the cost of repair. I am annoyed that we need to replace this item after such a short period of time.Initially gave Coby four stars due to price and features. Revised rating to two stars. You get what you pay for."
4,What you expect,"You get what you pay for, I am happy with this DVD player. Its a good bedroom dvd player."
1,Not Really Region Free,"The code provided on this page for unlocking the Coby 224 to make it region free, does not work for all Coby 224 DVD players. I purchased the 224 this afternoon and for normal use, it works very well but the player I own does NOT respond to the code provided within these reviews and it does not respond to any other recommended unlocking code. If you simply desire a conventional DVD player, the Coby 224 seems to be a very good choice, but if you are expecting a reliable region free player, you might want to keep shopping."
2,Very disappointed!,"I bought this last year, despite the poor reviews, because I usually watch DVDs about once a week or less. It is very easy to use (though you really don't want to lose the remote control because the unit itself doesn't have a lot of buttons) and it worked very well the first few months. But after about a year, I started to notice lately that there's been a lot of skippings and glitches (on new or good discs). If you plan on using this for longer than a year, then I would suggest buying a different one.Now I wish I could return it!"
3,Play dvd for grandson,It will not play some of the DVDs we have for grand son.LEARNING DVD.He only 2 1/2 yrs old.
2,different remote??,"I was so excited to get this dvd player to play items from the BBC store ...it did not play any of these from other regions...I think the remote must be different because the suggestions(and there are many on the internet) to get it to unlock for other regions include a stop button etc. not present on my remote...Coby tech support just sent me a cut and paste job from internet and didn't seem to want to be bothered that the remote they sent was different...it is a cute, easy to set up player but I already have one in every room and just needed a region free...I am still on the quest to unlock regions."
1,Had to return it twice,"I liked the compact size and the simple setup. HOWEVER, after less than a month it froze up and wouldn't play DVD's anymore. Amazon is super easy to exchange stuff so I did that but the replacement unit they sent me did the exact same thing. :( I ended up just returning it for a refund."
2,As advertised but too loud,"I bought this DVD player to replace a DVD/VCR combo in the bedroom. The setup was a snap and removed the country code on the second try. It played all DVDs that I tried. However, the issue I ran into was the how loud the motor was. I was probably more sensitive to it because it was late at night and located in the bedroom with everyone else trying to sleep.The return was easy. I wouldn't hesitate to buy something from BuyNow or Amazon."
1,Don't Buy Coby,"Don't purchase Coby products. Actually, this product should be rated minus 5 stars. I purchased this DVD player, and the laser burned out within Coby's 90-day warranty period. The Warranty language stated that I'd have to pay the postage to send the item back to Coby and include a $10 money order in payment for postage of the replacement. The replacement DVD was also defective (a very loud humming affecting hearing the dialogue). For this 2nd defective DVD, Coby told me I was responsible for the $10 cost of shipping it back again! Besides the initial purchase price of the product, I'd be out of pocket an additional $30. A ""supervisor"" at Coby told me that if this should happen a THIRD time, I would then not have to pay to have it shipped it back to them. Coby expects its customers to pay for its shoddy workmanship. Very poor business policy."
1,Coby CD player review,I could not use the product because it did not match my existing system. Not enough info was given about the product.
1,AVOID THIS ONE,"I bought this hoping to view some UK DVDs. I was able to watch one, but after that it did not work at all. I am now shopping for a real one. Thoroughly disgusted. I waited too long to use it to get my money back. My fault."
1,"Junk, junk, junk, junk, junk, junk, junk, junk, junk, junk, junk, junk!","My mother purchased this for my daughters' room as their Christmas 2006 present. It didn't make it to 2008. It was fine for almost a year, and then the problems started. It would not read any of their DVDs and would freeze. I would clean the DVDs but they still would not play. I played the same DVDs successfully on another player, so the DVDs were not the issue. Sure, a year seems like a decent amount of time, I guess. But I refuse to pay Coby $25.00 to $30.00 EVERY year for a new DVD player. Our next one will be with a reputable manufacturer."
4,good for value,I bought this for my son who watches movies over and over. It would be nice if it had a sleep timer but it is cheap and you get what you pay for.
2,Not as advertised,"Specs listed an optical out - the unit I received didn't have one. Otherwise it seemed ok, but I needed the optical out so I returned it."
1,Great until it died,"I bought this from Amazon on June 24th and it is now dead, a little less than 6 month later. You put a disc in and it just spins and spins and never loads. This DVD player was used nightly for several hours. A sad replacement considering the old DVD player I had lasted 7 years. If you're looking for something to replace in months, this is it. Otherwise I would spend a little more money on a better quality product. The RCA player I have downstairs has lasted longer than this one. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,You get what you pay for,"I have two of these. The one that only gets used on rare occasions has been around for a year and a half. The one that gets used regularly lasted 6 mos. I guess in this case, low cost=cheap."
1,Very Disappointed,"Unpacked the player, plugged it into the wall outlet, turned on the power button and the ""green"" power light came on. I finished hooking up the player to the TV. When I reactivated the power button, the player wouldn't power up. I tried different power outlets in my home but no luck. I won this as a door prize so nothing lost but a real eye opener for ""getting what you pay for."""
2,"Conveniently small, but lacks quality.","The size of the player is small and portable, which would be the reason why it caught my attention. It was also marked at a cheap price, which was the selling point for me. However, purchasing the product has become an nuisance. Every single disc that I have played in this player has been a disaster even though all of the discs are in mint condition. During normal playback the DVD player has skipped several DVD chapters, completely stalled during playback with frozen video along with an annoying audio buzz, or it would constantly display video glitches as if there was a smudge of some kind on the disc. After ejecting each disc I would inspect the disc to see if there was any form of warping, scratches, or smudges as a result of fingerprints or anything similar, but they always appear clean and void of any blemishes."
4,Very good for the price,"Very good for the price, works perfectly well, so far. My only complaint is the remote control is completely different then the one in the picture, mine is credit-card sized and has no buttons for fast-forward or rewind. Those features are common on most DVD players. I feel I should have received the same remote displayed in the picture. But it works, so far, for the price, which can't be beat."
1,Worhtless ...,"I check the reviews before buying this product, I said to myself ""they must be exaggerating"" and bought it, It stopped working after watching 3 movies ... I took it to the recycling facilities. I have now a Phillips, bought it in Target for 30 USD."
2,Great while it lasted...,"For the price, the feature set is pretty unrivaled... It's all good... Up until it dies.Output quality is really good, especially considering the tiny price... Build quality is another thing, though. After about a month, it started having reading errors, quiting playing and going back to the idle screen. A couple days later, it wouldn't even spin anymore, unable to read any disk. In the end, pretty much disposable...Maybe our unit was defective, or got manhandled during shipping, but in the end, I'd have a tough time recommending this unit to anyone who needs to get more than a month's use out of it."
1,$25 for 2 months of playback?,"I had this DVD player for less than 2 months before it died. It was tiny, easy to setup and cheap - those are all the good points. It died in under 2 months which was greatly disappointing since my previous tiny cheap Coby had lasted 2+ years. And by died I mean it played DVDs for about 3 weeks beautifully and I was in love. Then around week 4 it decided some DVDs were unplayable by no particular means. I'd put in a DVD that would just hang on ""scanning"", the following DVD would play. The next day I wasn't surprised to see the one I'd played the night before wasn't playing and it was left in the DVD player while it was off so it wasn't the disc. And one that hadn't played previously suddenly would play. After a few weeks of that it just stopped playing all DVDs.I guess it's time to find another tiny cheap DVD player manufacturer because this was much more of a disappointment than $25 is woth."
1,Don't buy this junk.,"This DVD player is of the worst quality that I've ever seen. I have only used several times before it broke down on me. In addition, when i tried to get it fixed, i had to pay a twelve dollar shipping fee. Don't buy this junk DVD player."
1,Piece of junk,"I bought 2 coby dvd players for my friends in India. After bringing them to India, I realised its a junk. One doesn't play well, picture quality is bad, you can't hear sound and it skips some of the chapters. The other one is even worse, after putting the dvd in the slot it doesn't close. I feel this company is just cheating people who cannot return it. Its just a junk and I am surprised that good sites like amazon and outpost are carrying such cheap and low quality ones. Just don't buy this stupid one."
1,BAAAAD!,"Do not buy! I just bought it a few weeks ago and was able to play 3 DVD's before it stopped working. What do you expect for that price, and a no-name brand....."
1,This unit is NOT as advertised!,"This may be the only warning you get: the Colby DVD224 DOES NOT PLAY Region 2 DVDs. It seems to be preset for Region 1, and that's where you're stuck. There is NO WAY to rest it.All I wanted was a player to play DVDs from the UK. That's the only reason I ordered this product. If it is no good for that, it is no good at all to me.I called Colby, waited on hold for an hour, and finally talked to a service tech who told me that the unit could not be rest. I asked him to tell me specifically which unit I need to purchase in order to watch Region 2 DVDs, and he replied that ""basically none of ours will play that.""Apparently there was a means or resetting older units, but the new one can't be reset. It is stuck in PAL mode, the screen rolls so badly I couldn't even see to attempt to change it.If what you want is a no-region DVD player, this one definitely is not it."
1,Don't purchase this unit,"We purchased this DVD player as a Christmas gift. Sadly, we made the purchase on November 1st. I had never considered that Amazon would only give partial refunds for items purchased over six weeks prior. When we gave the DVD player as a gift, it did not work. As soon as we were told of the malfunction, we immediately processed a return of the player. I thought since the item was defective we would be reimbursed 100% of the purchase price -- wrong. We had to pay shipping to return the item and only received a partial refund. I will never purchase a Coby product again. This is not the first time that I have purchased inferior products from this manufacturer. Stay away from this product!"
1,not a good one,"Product failed to load any standard DVD. Obviously Coby is not top quality, but it still should have worked."
1,Dead before its 1st Birthday,"At about 6 months old the TV started complaining ""NO SIGNAL"" using the COBY S-Video output. Sometimes it would work after re-inserting the DVD a few times, or turning the COBY on/off.Now a consistent ""NO SIGNAL"", I've tried it with other TV's with same results. You get what you pay for, I guess.Anyone interested in any of the parts for it- MAYBE A REMOTE?????"
3,it worked,"I was looking for a DVD player that will play DVDs from Asia. This one does play them. I did try to change the region code according to one previous review. I am not sure the instructions work, I think it plays right out of box. I am satisfied with it.[updated 1/27/2010]After 1.5 years of very light use, it started to have issues. I left it on stand-by for a week(without powering it off by pressing the button on the front of the player), now there is no sound output anymore. will have to figure out what went wrong. Headache."
2,You get what you paid you,Lesson learned: you get what you pay for. I brought it because it was cheap and I didn't need any extra features the more expensive dvd players offered. I just needed something that played dvds on a small TV. The player brought within a month of use. I put the DVD in and it would just keep loading. It also had trouble opening and closing to eject discs. I'm staying away from no-name brands from now on. I should have paid an extra $40 for a better DVD the first time around.
1,Stay away! Scratches DVDs!,"We bought this dvd because it was the cheapest multizone dvd. Indeed, sometimes when you try to save money you end up losing money. It took me some time to find the code for removing the zone limitations, but I finally managed it. However, after a while I noticed scratches on some dvds. I was unsure for a while until I put in a brand new dvd and took it out scratched!Stay away from this dvd player!"
1,SOUNDS TERRIBLE I GOT A 1998 PRESSING,"I ordered this because it indicates it was a 2008 pressing but instead I got a cd that was pressed in 1998. Sounds awful compared to the cassette which I still have. I bought a different greatest hits from JS on cd and ""Count On Me"" on this other greatest hits cd sounds better than the ""Count On Me"" on this 1998 pressing of Gold. I played both on the same car cd player and boombox at home so I know this sound on Gold is lacking quality.""Love Too Good"" is the extended version on the cd unlike the truncated version on the cassette."
3,The New Duck Handbook,"Ornamental & Domestic Ducks Everything about Housing, Care, Feeding, Diseases & breeding"
3,BUYER LOOK AT INGREDIANTS,IF YOU ARE INTO NO CHEMICALS IN YOUR PRODUCTS THIS HAS PROPYLENE GLYCOL WHICH IS ANTI-FREEZE YOUR PUTTING ON YOUR HEAD GOING INTO YOUR BRAIN.WHY THEY NEED ALL THIS GARBAGE IN PRODUCTS IS DISAPOINTING .
3,"Ripoff, or am I just stupid?","Yes, I'm the stupid one--I should have known from the info provided that this was only a 28-minute long CD! What a ripoff. Not Amazon's fault."
3,"One of the classic Betty Grable musicals, but where are...","...""Wabash Avenue"", ""Sweet Rosie O'Grady"", ""Diamond Horseshoe"", ""Mother Wore Tights"", and ""Springtime in the Rockies""? All of these are also classic Grable musicals that are today very, very difficult to find unless you're fortunate enough to be watching a TV channel that shows one of them on the late-night show. Anyway, this movie is visually dazzling with numerous production numbers and lots of great costumes (though some may well raise their eyebrows at the Harlem-themed number about halfway through the film)."
4,Preserves old style Taekwon-Do thinking,"Recently, some friends from Taekwon-Do were married. Of all the books in my collection, this was the book that I tried to find for their present. When I started training, it was the only one available, so I have a special affection for it.The one-strike TKD theory has become all but extinct. This book shows what one of the premier grandmasters of TKD expects from practioners and preserves some of the old traditions.Of course, the whole section on forms is not ""current""."
2,Primarily of interest to students of Master Son,"As a martial arts work, it is fair at best. But to students of Chun Do Kwan Tae Kwon Do, it is an essential addition to their library."
3,Still exciting but somewhat disappointing,"This book was great, but did not compare to Story of O. I was disappointed. I still recommend this if you are curious about O."
5,Excellent CD!,I recently purchased Brooks and Dunn's new Cd. I have listened to all 14 songs on the album and I like all of them. I highly recommend this cd. I have all of Brooks and Dunn's cds. Buy this cd... you won't be disappointed!
2,Cheap hand shower,"I am sorry I got this, it's cheap. Mostly plastic and it looks that way. I plan on remodeling my children's bathroom so it will due until then, but again cheap. I would not recommend this product."
3,No...Yes...Maybe?,"Hello,I am still unsure on what to write about this hair product. When I first put it in my hair-- after washing it-- this product made it extremely hard for me to comb through my hair. My hair literally felt like straw! But after I finally brushed out the many tangles, blow-dryed it and styled it-- my hair did appear softer and even felt softer than before. I even got a few compliments from strangers telling me that my hair looked shiny! But I still don't like to use it everyday because it honestly seems to make my hair a lot dryer and harder to brush out when it is in the wet stage! Maybe I just need a better conditioner (Though, my conditioner is a Matrix product) I don't know... I am still testing it... Thumbs down at first then up and then mid way!?I guess I was looking for a miricle-- lol -Ronda"
4,For the Dedicated Trainer not Newbie,"Training with author is mandatoring in my barefoot trimming certification course, so I thought I would get an early jump on the reading. I am a confirmed clicker trainer, with clicker as an overlay, mostly on John Lyons training.Definitely Nice to Have for the person very interested in training, animal behavior and the science behind it all. Perhaps not the first or second book to buy for a Newbie trainer who really wants to get started today!"
1,Do not buy,I have this range one week and have had repair service twice! Same problem-- oven does not stay lit. Am putting into dispute with my credit card company.
2,Only for those who want small schools,"Beware - 80% of the colleges in this book have less than 3,000 students and many of them have a student population of almost half that. As my son is not interested in such small schools I would not have purchased this book had I known; it was a waste of money for me. Amazon really commits a disservice to its customers in not being clearer in the item's description."
2,Doesn't live up to the title,"This book has an attractive title, and perhaps even an important message. Unfortunately, the author really isn't very articulate at getting it across. Granted he may be talking about things that are difficult to put into words, but surely someone could do better than this repetitive confusion."
3,Preferable to broadway soundtrack,"'Hair"" is an important play from the 1970's.It was one of the first mainstream plays to incorporate contemporary rock music...or so I thought. When I listen to the Broadway version, in hindsight, it sounds like basic, conventional Broadway tunes given a faux ""rock"" sheen.I like the movie soundtrack better since the musicality of these songs are expounded upon, the musicianship shines and the songs look more like ""real"" songs rather than just accompaniments to a play.I enjoyed the play but I'm not all crazy about ""Hair"" or any other play. I'm a ""music"" fan and like to see if a soundtrack holds up on it's own, rather than just being an accompaniment to a play.This movie soundtrack vastly improves upon all of the songs from the play soundtrack. I especially like ""Aquarious"" with it's lengthy instrumental opening before it erupts into the classic lyrics."
2,See the show on Broadway,I enjoyed the movie for years until I saw the show on Broadway. I used to own the movie soundtrack on vinyl and was excited to get the extra tracks on the CD...until I heard them. There's a reason why it was left off the vinyl.
2,Hair: Original soundtrack Recording - special anniversary Edition,"The music quality was not very good. It sounded like it was recorded on the wrong speed, and the singers in a different octave . It doesn't compare with the original recording on LP."
2,Hard on the ear,"Great song writer but hard on the ear , my kids were in the back begging me too turn it off ."
4,Product performs as expected - Can wear with heels!,This product perfect for your toe if it's starting to curl up a little (hammertoe). This product flattens out the toe and separates it a bit from your big to perfectly and comfortably. It fits perfectly and comfortably/cushions under your foot and does not interfere with your heels/shoes! Invisible and comfortable. Need to buy some more... I can already see the difference - my toes is starting to straighten out. Wear it every day.
3,Not sure.,"Not sure this works as advertised. The independent (amazon) seller definitely had the best price around (much appreciated), but for my situation, this product did not prove very effective, or maybe I am not persistent enough in its use, or maybe it is not meant to fix my toe's condition. It might work for a wandering toe going gonzo-crooked, but my toe joint remains uncomfortably enlarged for some reason that may have nothing to do with straightening. So I can draw no sure conclusion. Better luck to you."
2,Toe Straightener,"Save your money! While the product provides a little support, other than that it doesn't do much. The elastic over the toe has to be extremely tight to feel any support, and consequently, the elastic stretched out very quickly. Try the Silipos gel toe crest. I've been much happier with that!"
1,WORTHLESS,"I have no clue how this is suppose to straighten your toe. I had this on my toe for 3 days. It was uncomfortable and it was a relief as soon as I took it off. When I washed it, the cloth and strap came right off the pad. I was very upset and disappointed with this product. This is a cheap and worthless item. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!"
5,This book has all that's required to become a classic in the field,"This book has all that's required to become a classic in the field. First of all, the content wasn't quickly put together; instead it has been distilled and refined along many years of hard work. Then, due to the generic nature of the topic, this is going to be a valuable reading for many years to come, definitely something that isn't going to become outdated very soon.The only negative comment I could find is that it's not really an engaging read, especially if you read the whole in a linear way, but that something that, more or less, apply to every pattern catalogue. In the end the format lend itself better if used as a reference."
5,A recommended pick for any software design collection,"The second updated edition of Jenifer Tidwell's DESIGNING INTERFACES: PATTERNS FOR EFFECTIVE INTERACTION DESIGN is a recommended pick for any software design collection, offering an updated edition that includes patterns for mobile apps and social media as well as web applications. Each pattern offers color examples and design advice for experienced designers and novices alike, making it a pick for any software engineering library."
4,"Good Primer, Great Resource","A fantastic how-to and reference for interface design. Well stocked with images and illustrations. The layout is beautiful and functional. It's incredibly easy to quickly find what you need in here.Designing Interfaces is a good primer, but it's also a great reference. Shoot through the book for a quick understanding of how different interfaces work and what their design patterns are. Then keep it handy when interface discussions come up.I've already recommended it to four people who've already purchased it and a few more are on the way.Very highly recommended."
3,A dictionary for designers,"This book takes the form of a long list of design elements (e.g. trees and cascading lists), with examples and suggestions on when you should use them. And that's all. It might be useful as a reference for communicating ideas to members of a team, if you don't have the vocabulary for all of the elements described in this book, but don't expect to find inspiration or excitement in these pages."
2,Flimsy and cheap,"VERY thin and cheap. However, I wasn't surprised, given that they were only $17.00. I needed a cheap boot because winter has ruined all of my nice ones, so overall it will get the job done. However, I am going to have to exchange this pair because they have a huge gash in the side of one of the boots. Nice."
2,A disappointing purchase,"My expectations for this DVD were very high given who the musicians are. Everything pointed to a great purchase, but I will not be playing it again because the video quality is just too poor. There is also some annoying clicking and the image gets very unreal, almost like something computer generated. It could have been wonderful, given the illustrious singers, conductor and locale but someone did not take enough care in its production. Too bad!"
5,One of the best albums ever recorded...,I knew Genai and the rest of the band personally. Not only were they the best ska-punk (3rd-wave ska) band in SoCal -- ever -- but they were the nicest people too.They came at a needed time in my life and I miss them a lot.Buy this album. You won't be disappointed.
4,Good for the hard of hearing.,"Bought this for my mother-in-law who is 88. She is now able to hear her daughter on the phone, at least a little bit. Previously she could not hear anything. I don't really know how it works, but it does."
1,Mirafone,"We have purchased this product in the past a it worked wonderfully. However this time this product does not work. WE have tried to contact the seller 3 times with no response. The phone is made for people with hearing loss and all we hear on this phone is static.This is one of the few times I have purchased a product from Amazon that was not a book, I don't think I will purchase anything other than books in the future. Since I cannot seem to return a defective product and Amazon is absolutely worthless in customer service.I would never purchase anything from this vendor again."
1,Phone for hard of hearing,A very useless product. The audio its main feature is very bad. The product is completely useless. I would never recommend anyone to buy the product based on my experience with it. Thoroughly useless product. Never had a good day of usage with this phone. I hope no one ever buys this phone if hard of hearing is your condition.
1,Save Money by buying Vitamin B12 Instead of Ripped Fuel,I've used this for a couple of weeks and it does work. The reason this product works is the 833% of Vitamin B12 and a little bit of caffeine. The remaining ingredients are all vitamins you can find in an average daily Vitamin pill. Save Money by buying Vitamin B12 Instead of Ripped Fuel which is 833% of your daily need.
2,so/so,"The shipping on this took FOREVER, almost a month. When I finally rec'd the item it wasn't the same one as I purchased a couple years ago, I'm not sure if they changed it recently or sent me the wrong one, but I would rather pay regular price and buy it at GNC or something than to wait so long next time. (IF IT WORKS)"
2,Learn to bite a lightbulb!?,"These look too much like a real light bulb to be a dog toy. I'm afraid that if somehow my dog came upon a real light bulb someday (which of course we very much intend to avoid) she would be very likely to try to bite it since it looks like a toy she has played with. I would just hate to make her more likely to get hurt ""just in case"" she accidentally gets access to a light bulb. Something to consider."
5,The Definition of Mariachi Music - SUPERB! A CLASSIC!,"We have looked high and low for this CD. My parents had this album (LP) back in the 60's-70's and would listen to it all the time. As we (the children) grew up, somehow the album cover was in the stereo cabinet, BUT without the LP itself. We looked in every album thinking maybe it just got put back in the wrong place......absolutely no luck. We could never find it. For the last 8 years,we have been looking for it in LP or CD form. Amazon.com has come through for us! So much so that I have ordered 5 to share with the familia! Check out the songs....these are the authentic versions of traditional Mariachi music. Great CD. Crystal Clear sound! Definitely worth the price! A CLASSIC!"
4,Christopher Lee performs well!,"The only downside to this was that the content was not entirely Mr. Lee, which is why I bought this in the first place. His content was amazing, and the other content wasn't bad, it just wasn't what I was expecting to get."
3,Okay Backpack,"Back pack is good for lighter things. We did a hike with our dog with the backpack and it just had 2 smaller jugs of water in it and the backpack broke open at the seams. Luckily a friend of ours reinforced the sides and now it holds the two jugs of water just fine. Our dog loves it because it gives her a ""job"" on our walks."
4,A good read,"River Woman was very interesting. At times I thought it was slow moving and it was hard to tell sometimes whom was talking. After a while I wanted to stop reading it because I thought it wasn't moving fast enough but somehow the characters drew me in. I wanted to continue reading to find out if Kelithe allowed her son to drown. This book is very sad just reading about Kelithe's mother did not stand by her or feel like she was her daughter. Her mother Sonya is a hypocrite because she attempted an abortion when she was pregnant with Kelithe. It made me wonder, why couldn't Sonya show her daughter any love? And the reaction of the town was just aweful but this book made me think. This is not a book for entertainment but for thinking and seeing a trajedy from a different perspective.If someone is interested in a funny and entertaining book this one is not it. This is a riveting book that takes you places where most of us have never been."
1,Not good,I luv Johanna Lindsey books but this was not good at all.I don't think she was awake when she wrote this. I'm just sad bought
1,I hated this book,This book is Lindsey's worst sequel. It didn't have a plot and it condoned wife-beating. This book is a waste of the paper it's printed on.
2,Not as good as the first one...,"This book wansn't that bad, but when you compare it to the first one (written about the heroine's parents) it is a disappointment. What happened? The hero is kind, but I didn't like the heroine at all. She had absolutely no redeeming qualities; in fact she refused to be sorry for any of the problems she caused for other characters. I look forward to another sequel in the story, but I hope Lindsey takes a little more time with it than she did with this one."
4,"Great price, good product","At various office stores USB 2.0 cables cost upwards of $35.00 - I got this one with gold connectors, for much less, and shipping was super-fast. The most important thing, when I used it to connect my printer/scanner to my computer, it worked like a charm.I'd buy more cables from Tripp Lite without hesitation."
4,Works well,Using it to connect my printer and laptop. Does an excellent job. Good length. Sturdy cord and ends.
5,Superior quality,Combined these with the HP Photosmart D7300 for superior quality connection. Also replaced the connectors for my scanner.
2,Corny and predictable,"I thought this movie would be better than it was.I don't think I could tolerate such a corny family gathering as the one portrayed in this movie. Morning exercise/dancing, talent show, singing around the piano....*barf!*The funniest part of this movie was Dan's middle daughter, who reminded me of mine!The ending to this movie was too cozy and it was so obvious what would happen."
2,So bad it hurts.,"Another title for this movie could be, 'A Fist Full Of Cliches'. Another reviewer said that Steve Carell was pretty good up until the shower scene - he wasn't. I happen to know that the third pancake up in the stack has written a better screenplay than this. I'm putting the same amount of energy into this review as went into the script."
1,Juliette Binoche is wasted in this predictable tripe,"Such a disappointment. Started out strong enough, but once they hit the beach house it became bad sitcom writing, where people do things that are completely out of character just to get a laugh. The only time I felt like I was watching real people was when the two lead characters were flirting in a book store - that felt real! But then the movie falls apart into cliches and stupidity, and I couldn't get through more than 30 minutes of it. Such a shame to waste the talents of Juliette Binoche, who I've been a big fan of since 'Blue'"
4,NOT WHAT YOU'D EXSPECT,"This is an unlikely movie for this star, and other than a few foolish moments it is very good with a lot to say."
2,Long winded book,"This is the 2nd Jay McGraw book, and I am falling for the same reason why I bought the first book. Great cover design, rich colour and great title and synopsis. In both case I find the book really low in content relative to the number of pages it has. I am not saying that it has no content , but if you bought this book to extract contents quickly, you are going to be disappointed. You will enjoy this book if you have all the time in the world and want to make the book last for hours. Compare to other self help books, both Life Strategies for teens and this book are somewhat similar in content and the manner it makes the book thick. I think it could be condense in 25 pages and sell for twice the price.- If you rate this review, rate it 'helpful' because I shared something sincerely. Don't rate it not-helpful because you don't like what I wrote or disagree - It is a review and did the reviewer give you a review ? -"
3,"For cat lovers, not art historians","Cute book for a little girl who loves both cats and period costumes (boys might like it too, but most won't admit to the period costume part). If you are looking for something that shows how cats were actually portrayed in medieval times, keep going. This is a strictly modern variation which replaces the figures in medieval-type illuminated ""manuscripts"" with cuddly cats. The operative word, once again, is cute."
3,Average,I have this unit for 2 weeks now. It has an ok feel on the ear but a little heavy for all day wear. It works ok but the sound gets digitized or echo's at times.I use it because once you get used to the hands free working its hard to hold a phone but I wish the clarity was better.I note that the Set Up was easy.
4,Good headset - not heavy on the ear.,"This headset works very well, is not too heavy on the ear and picks up calls from all around the office. My only complaint would be that it is a bit fuzzy."
2,What were they thinking?,"Lightweight and reasonably comfortable; multiple earpieces for various earholes; but the inability to mute from the Headset Base? What was someone not thinking? Beware. If you don't need to mute alot then this one is OK otherwise avoid. Muting requires a two-finger hard sqeeze for ""3 seconds"" of the headset down volume button. Gets tired real quick.Not Recomended."
4,Functions well. Ugly design.,"The noise reduction works well. On my back deck it subtractsout all of the lawn mowers, traffic, and most of the flightsoverhead, leaving only the birds and the rustling of the leavesin the wind.I also like how the headphones fold up. They are a practicalsize for slipping in the already overstuffed laptop bag onflights.But these headphones are ugly. Not just ordinary ugly: buttugly. Sennheiser needs to hire an outside design firm for thenext release."
3,Nice,The headphones had great sound and canceled out most of the noise. However I wanted to use them in an office setting and they did not do so well on canceling out voices and telephone rings. Upon further research I learned that it is almost impossible to cancel out voices using this type of technology. I bet they would be great for traveling.
5,Sennheiser PXC 250 a 5 star hit with me,"Ambient noise just dropped like a rock when I turned on the Noise Reduction, Blondie's Greatest Hits is what I chose for my maiden voyage with the PCX 250, Debbie Harry never sounded more dynamic! This product is so much better than reading available reviews was leading me to believe, Excellent Base and clear, crisp, snappy high end response was all there, to more than my satisfaction, I would recommend these headphones to the pickiest audiophile. These are headphones that allow you to experience music and even books on tape, with clarity and an addictive presence.Bravo"
4,Good Product,This was one of the best gifts my husband got for his b'day. The product is light weight and easy fold able.The sound quality was very high compare to the sony brand. The noise cancellation works only when you insert the AAA batteries. The product is worth it's price.
3,Not worth the money. Ordinary sound and cumbersome.,"Basically the sound quality is no better than my sony sports headphones which were $100 less. What you are paying for is this cumbersome battery-operated noise reducer which basically just plays some muffling static sound in the background to block out external noise. I guess they would be Ok on a plane, but certainly not worth the $150 I paid for them."
2,very disappointing design,"While the noise reduction circuitry works fine, it is of little use considering the flawed design. The ear pads fit ON instead of over and around the ears. This not only lets in background noise but also gets pretty uncomfortable after awhile since you have to have them as tight as possible to get any noise reduction at all. Until Sennheiser has the sense to use a more sensible design, stick with the cushioned sets that go over the ear for comfort and keeping out more noise."
4,Subject to Interferrence,"I used these headphones for about 2 years and really loved them. However, that all changed when I got an iPhone. These headphones pick up a lot of interference from cellphones and wifi networks, which can render them basically unusable. Overall they're great headphones, very comfortable, and create noise reduction. Other negatives are the battery holder is a bit bulky and there's entirely too much cable."
3,Noise Canceling Headphones,I have owned Bose Noise Canceling headphones for many years. They are more effective for my 65-yr old ears than the Sennheiser. I find the Bose are more comfortable albeit a tad heavier than the Senneiser. The Sennheiser phones are very good and are much less bulky and heavy than Bose.
3,Too tight (especially if you are wearing glasses),I generally like this one. I found the noise canceling adequate. My biggest problem is that it is too tight around your ears and after a couple of hours it starting to hurt quite a bit. Especially if you are wearing glasses.
2,My ears hurt! Not recommended if your head is big...,"This is my 2nd Sennheiser, and this one is also not compatible with my head. After about an hour, I have to take it off because my ears really hurt. Too much pressure, not enough cushioning, I guess.I've had it for nearly 4 years now and use it on every flight (4-5 per year). The fake leathery layer on the cushions has been peeling off for about a year, often leaving black dots in my ears.These a two really big cons. Otherwise, the headphones are fine and do what they are supposed to do. Sound is ok, so is battery life. Nice compact and lightweight."
5,Sennilier headphones,"I love them. I use them to listen to lectures in my Master Program. They cancel most irritating noise so I can concentrate on the lecture. My biggest problem: Keeping my son from ""borrowing"" them."
4,Perfect Travel Companion,"Before I leave for the airport I check for my wallet first and my Sennheisers next! (Thank goodness for e-tickets!)Sennheiser has always provided superior sound performance in a lightweight headset. These are no exception.The difference is that with a flick of a switch the background noise from the plane is dropped about 70%. The effect is magical and the extra $50 I spent seems well worthwhile.To net it out:+Noise Cancellation: Excellent on planes, trains and the bus. Less effective in normal wear.+Compact Size: Easily folds down for compact storage+Great Sound: Good bass, full treble+Case: Comes with a carrying case for the headset, adapters. Even fits the IPod-The noise cancelling unit adds weight and can be awkward. Worth it when travelling, not so much sitting at home."
5,They do the job,"I work in an envirnoment with a LOT of background fan and equipment noise, these do quite well bringing down the background noise. I'm not fond of the separate battery compartment, however with the very light weight on the head it's an acceptable trade off. My wife LOVED these on our most recent air travel. Battery life has been quite good, yes I turn them off whenever I'm not using them, it would be silly not to do so. My wife accidentally left them turned on for a week, 24/7, which did run down the battery, but even after that I've had several hours of use without replacing the batteries."
4,Work great. Battery case annoying.,"I've had these headphones for over a month and four plane flights. They work very well at filtering out low-frequency noise. The on-ear design can get warm, but these headphones manage to remain comfortable even after an hour or two of use. The sound is swell.Caveats:- the on-cord battery case is cumbersome. Wish it were on the headset itself somewhere. It'd be nice if it had a volume adjustment, too.- the headphones don't block higher-pitched noises. This can be a plus when you're where you need to hear what's going on around you, such as a flight attendant's instructions to prepare for a crash. But it's no help to drown out the screaming baby one row back. For that, you have to pump up the volume.Overall, a good product for the money (note: I bought mine refurbished)."
1,Not for the active,"I didn't like these for the following reason. Whenever I bumped the small noise canceling unit, it makes an awful noise in the earphones. Like changing the radio station to a static station at loud volume. The Bose I used to have don't do that. Not for the active."
4,Good value for the Price,"More than adequate for average use. Lightweight and convenient to carry. Good sound quality with okay noise reduction. A little light on the head and tension over the ear could be better, but overall a good selection for occasional air travel."
4,So Far So Great!,"I bought these when I knew I was traveling to China and going to be on a plane for extended times. I had a friend recommend this model and said that it was the best. So far I have had good results -excellent sound quality and awesome noise reduction. I have not had to replace the batteries after approximately 60 hours of use with a mp3 player on planes, in trains and watching movies on my laptop."
4,Great for planes,"I travel quite a bit and have been looking for headphones that would work for overseas travel. The open air headphones just let in too much noise and the closed headphones are too heavy to wear for 8 hours. These are a nice compromise. Feather light, but pretty good mechanical isolation. They sound great."
2,Flimsy,"Sound quality isn't too bad, although the bass is a little muddy. Unfortunately, the connection between each headphone and the band between them is a flimsy plastic thing. Mine broke within a couple of months, and the connection is so tiny that even superglue doesn't really fix it. Not worth the price."
5,Awesome and amazing,"I was skeptical about ordering the product, but based on the other reviews and compared with Sony and Panasonic, I took the final plunge and ordered it.I am so AMAZED by the quality. The noise cancelling is so awesome and I am only happy I took the deal on amazon and ordered it.I would recommend this product who want to listen to music blissfully."
2,value for money? bad headphones,"I bought this model (refurbished) with a broken switch. I send 3 mails to Sennheiser and they didn't answer to my problem. RESULT: The service sucksNow the sound is so and so and the noise canceling system doesn't work for me i tried it to airplane, train and metro. The sound sucks, Company SucksNOT RECOMMENDED!!!Try some other models and not Sennheiser"
2,Jim,Was not real happy about spending the money I did after reading reviews on this product. Does not cancel noise very well and sound quality is less then what I expected for the money. I wouldn't recommend these.
2,small and light but tinny,"I'm not really happy with these. I didn't expect them to be up to the Bose standard for noise reduction but still, I expected higher quality of sound. They are merely adequate. But they are, at least, small and light and easy to carry."
4,Good product at a good price,"These noise canceling headphones are lightweight, inexpensive, compact, and work pretty will in diminishing airplane noise. I would definitely recommend them to others. (Don't know yet about battery life as mine are new still.)"
3,Somewhat pleased,"I just received my PXC 250's from Amazon, and this review represents my first impression.The Good:The noise reduction circuity does seem to reduce the drone coming from my computer. I mainly bought these for use in my home office, so that is a plus. Noise reduction at middle and high frequencies is non-existant.Middles and highs are well defined. These headphones sound good for several types of music and at low volume. Symphonic classical sounds great through these headphones.Human voice reproduction is good, and these headphones would make a good choice for listening to audio books.The bad:The headphones will not reproduce accurate, loud bass. The response below about 60 hz is very poor at high volume. You'll need to use your imagination. These headphones are not a good choice for most top 40 music, or if you just like your music very loud.These are not as comfortable to wear as I expected. The noise reduction module is large, heavy, and requires two AAA batteries."
2,I've had two pairs of these ...,"I bought my first pair of these and I only used them in airplanes & airports. They're great to have on the plane as the jet noise is reduced enough that you'll forget about it. I like the way the speakers will pivot 90 degrees to your ears so that you can quickly uncover an ear if you're asked a question. Other than that I found myself wishing I had a different pair. The wand-sensor has reversable clip but its too bulky and I never found a good way to run the cords.I lost my first pair and had no intention of buying the same pair again, but before I could replace them I was given another pair as a gift. The 2nd pair was no better and I noticed the same annoying things I had with the first including a feedback that occurs during flight when when the plane begins to descend.I'd rather spend more money on a better designed product."
2,Disppointed on background static,"This headphone does cancel the noise dynamically. However, in noise cancellation mode, it generates a static background noise, quite annoying."
3,Mixed Review,These headphones come in a handy case which accommodates one's ipod along with the purchased items. The headphone pads are comfortable but the unit applies too much pressure on the ears to be comfortable for any length of time. The sound is good but the noise canceling is not as effective as I thought it might be while riding on the train. The side pads on the headband help with the comfort level on the top of the head.
4,headphones,"Did not receive the item - when company informed they resent and I did receive them then,good product, good company"
5,Great juicer,Great little juicer. Works well to get all the juice from a lemon or orange and measures the volume as well.
4,Great for lime/lemon NOT for oranges,"This cute,cheap and compact device is awesome for juising lime/lemon but not too good for oranges. Mainly, bc the container is too small and you can only juice half an orange at the time, then u have to empty /clean all the pulps and seeds afterwards, it is ready to juice the rest of orange!"
3,Good for lemons only,It is just a basic small lemon juicer and that's what I used it for. it does exactly that. I tried to juice an orange on it but it is a little to small to do a good job for that.
5,Perfect for what I need,"Sure beats juicing a lemon by just squeezing it, which is what I have been doing. Nice size and dishwasher safe. Love it!"
5,Lightning Turns on the Electricity,"Just listened to this for the first time and it is a real eye opener. I have loved Lightin Hopkins for years but this is the most intense effort I have come across from him. Here he is plugged in with a bass player and a drummer brave enough to try and follow Lightnin. It all works here, the slow songs, the rockers, the boogie grooves on here were years ahead of their time and some of the leads just scream on here. Lightin sings like a younger stronger man on here and his voice is clearer and much more powerful on this recording, undimmed by age, tobacco and bourbon. This is a really great window into what a Lightning Hopkins show in a gin joint in Houston must have sounded like in the mid-50's. It is a stunningly powerful recording that shows just how broad and deep this man's immense musical powers really were. Must have for blues, folk, and rock enthusiasts. This is primal and essential."
4,great oldies!,"My mom and I love the song 'Wonderful World'. I was however, a little disturbed by one of the other comments. ""If you dont have anything nice to say, dont say anything at all"" comes to mind. Even if you dont particularly like something, point out the good aspects, not the bad!!"
5,brilliant cd,this cd is a must have the song last mango in paris has a highly captive verse that will have you singing along so buy it now or your regret it forever.
3,like the concept but not on the road...more design?,Took it out first time..not sure if I have it on right because no directions but I almost had a wreck a couple of times because when Id adjust the mirror it would just come loose. I like the mirror and like that its big thats not a complaint... keeping it locked in the correct position is a problem for me . Ill mess with it more and have my son look at it..he may find Im doing it wrong..if true then Ill repost or delete this but maybe go a few bucks more if you just want one that works good...
3,"Gets the job done, with some help","I mounted this on the bar of my recumbent. After gluing a convex mirror to the surface of the supplied flat plain mirror for wide angle viewing. I was surprised this did not come with a wide angle mirror which I thought was totally standard for bicycles. Had to use a rubber shim to increase the bar diameter for the c-clamp mount to work right. And yes, a lock washer/nut is needed.The basic design of the mirror is exactly what I needed, so the mods were worth the trouble. There is minimal vibration on rough surfaces, a major plus.3 stars 'cause of the flat plain mirror."
2,Way too short to see behind one,The arm/stem is very short and my son can not use it in the way intended on his bike -- he cannot see behind him because his arm is in the way. Great size for the mirror itself but try another one.
2,"small mirror, points random directions","This mirror is great for getting the bugs unstuck from your teeth while racing around on your bike. It's a 3in diameter compact mirror attached to an arm about 5-6 inches in length. Pee Wee Herman would be jealous of this wonderful mirror. The mount has been designed so that when you tighten it the arm can still rotate freely within the mounting bracket, making it fun to continuously adjust while riding. The bracket is expertly engraved with a large Made in Taiwan logo, it looks classy! As other commenters have suggested, locking nuts from the hardware store might be used to secure the mirror in one orientation, but how boring is that? For only $3 you totally get what you pay for."
1,It's not for me!,"My last organizer is a Sharp. I LOVE it. But of course it's not available anymore. Because you can't really see how this product actually works I thought it should be about the same. The main thing I needed was to organize my schedule and where my old YO-520 exceeded, this EL-6930 failed. It's probably wonderful for keeping your contact info but not for my purposes. I was very disappointed."
4,Go back and reread these,"These Henry Reed books were some of the first books I have ever read, and I enjoyed them much, and of course I wished there were more than three (there are, but the newer ones weren't available back then). Every time our family went to the library I would go directly to the Keith Robertson section and see if there were any new titles. They are the typical children's novels, a smart boy figures out things the adults around him are unable to. The best is *Henry Reeds Journey* - a picaresque.I recently went back and reread what I first consider the first ""real"" book I read while I was a child: *The Year of the Jeep* also by Keith Robertson. considered it my first real book because it didn't have any illustrations, even on the cover (in the copy I originally borrowed from the Oak Lawn Library.)I have a review of it here, somewhere.(If you are an adult) I would strongly advise going back and finding the ""first book I ever read"" and rereading it. Fun."
3,britt from richview middle school,"The main characters of the story are Henry and Midge. Henry moved here from Naples,Italy. They tried to start a research business out of a old barn. To find out more you will have to read this book."
1,Peachtree fittings are Chinese and sized wrong,"The dust collection fittings from Peachtree woodworking (PTW) are made really bad. I bought 3 different ones to connect my various shop tools to my vacuum. They do not fit any vacuum hose or other fittings I have. I have tried other couplers and fittings and nothing will go over or inside PTW's fittings. Most fittings are sized so a couple will fit over them, NOT PTW's. I got real sick right after I bought the fittings and could not go into my shop for 3 months. The shipping bag with these fittings sat on my bench the whole time unopened. I called Peachtree and they blew me off saying no-one else complained and to much time had passed, bad move, hence the 1 rating. All 3 fittings were only $11 or $12, so the loss is not terrible but the service from Peachtree is!Peachtree has the worst customer service I have experienced on Amazon! This another reason to only BUY AMERICAN!"
4,Sorry the others didn't get it.,"I read some reviews posted by others and it seems pseudo-intellectual jealousy has motivated them. For those of you who would like to learn to think for yourselves, this is an interesting and accessible read. You'll find much that is worth your time.To the others who reviewed this book with such venom, ask yourselves why. What's missing from your own lives? You've come across as very bitter and unhappy. Maybe a little fresh air would help."
5,Good book on the basis of art and art forms.,"Ayn Rand explains the issue of man, his philosophy and how his image reflects itself in his literary and tactile arts. She really makes us appreciate the feeling and attitudes of the artist with his modern vs traditional artistic creations. Excellent book and references."
2,Rand gets confused about her own opinions of art,"Perhaps it's because I'm a photographer and Rand insists that photography isn't art that I find her characteristically longwinded pronouncements on art to be somewhat muddled. First, she states that art must represent more than a powerfull image, emotion or mood. Then she calls Vermeer ""the greatest of all artists"", noting that he devoted his unquestioned skills to ""a single theme: light itself"". Welcome to my world, Ayn, that's all photography is, a two demensional representation of real light. But her Vermeer argument is badly weakened by that famous work of 17th century pornography, Girl with Pearl Earing. In this work, Vermeer shows he has more than light on his mind, producing about as powerful an image of raw sexuality as the time would permit. There's nothing intellectual about either beautiful light or a sexy girl. They're both about image, emotion or mood; that is, all the things Rand herself insists are not art."
2,Be aware that this book is for Non-standard tuning,"Unfortunately as a complete novice while travelling in Australia, I bought a cheap uke, pitch pipes and this book all in the same shop at the same time, for years I couldn't fathom how this just didn't translate to guitar and have just started playing again and realised after playing along to my daughters beginner's book that the pitch pipes I was sold were GCEA and the book is for ADFsharp B.Thanks very much Zenith Music, Claremont 6010, WA !!I would imagine that if there is a version of this book in standard tuning it will be far more useful."
4,Almost Perfect,"The Senneheiser PX 100 are a great pair of heaphones and a good ipod accesory, though slightly pricey. The sound is full and the base response is pretty fantastic. However the sound depends on the 'placement' of the buds over the ears, By adjusting the buds I got a much better experience.However the headphones are a bit pricey for the category and you could get better value from the Koss KSC 55 (my old headphones)"
4,Good headphones at a great price,"Very good sound quality, warm and clear. I've used them with all types of music except heavy metal. The collapsible feature and the included case makes these a good value. I wear them a few hours at a time and don't even know they are there. Highly recommend."
4,Sennheiser PX-100 Collapsible Headphones,"For the price, excellent sound reproduction, light weight and portability. Found two drawbacks. One, the cable failed at the connector. The headphones were quickly replaced by Sennheiser. There should be a larger strain relief over the connector and further up onto the cable, which is rather thin. Two, the ear cushions are a bit flimsy and one ripped very easily. Overall a very good headset for the price."
