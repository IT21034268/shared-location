5,Haunting and Beautiful,"In Crooked Fingers, Eric Bachman has created two masterpieces of albums that any self-respecting melancholy music fan should own. Best described as melodic drunken bar music, Bring On The Snakes is a story cd above any others, crafting and weaving the best song tales since Bob Dylan. If you love AoL, great. If you hate them-well, too bad, but that's no reason not to get this completely different, vastly superior effort. A perfect album."
4,Great watch,This is a great watch. I was worried that the dial size might be too big for my thin wrist but the leather strap complimented by hugging to the wrist. It took me less time to play around and understand the settings.What would have made this an excellent watch?1. Backlight2. flexibility to display local date + different time on digital windows.
5,Excellent - well designed,"We're very pleased with this unit. So many excellent features: swivel board, adjustable height, digital timer (which shuts off the power to the iron after a set period of time), storage location for iron, hot iron rest, task lighting, bar for hanging ironed clothes on a hanger, extra storage shelves, etc.A few details that aren't immediately apparent:1) the ironing center is installed into the wall at the 'low' height setting. There's a single height adjustment available which is 4 inches higher which is easily adjusted once you've lowered the board.2) The task light doesn't swivel, so you need a wide angle flood bulb.3) There's a safety switch that automatically disconnects the power when you close the door, so the iron can't be left 'on' by accident.Unit is well built, well packed for shipping. Overall, we would recommend this ironing center to others."
2,Not much for the price,It seemed to be well built but after I installed it and opened the door a few times the seams where it was put together seperated.It was poorly joined together. I repaired it with some small screws.
3,Not strong enough,While working great these magnets are not strong enough to stay the mask on when doing a lot of diving on ie a liveaboard. I will not keep buying replacements after every trip.
3,A Disappointed Fan,"I've read most of B.J. Hoff's other books and loved them. But I was disappointed with this one because of the subplot of the MacGovern family inserted into the story. At the end of the book, it still shows no connection to the rest of book. To me, this is an obvious effort to sell more books, which I resent. If a book is a good read, I'll buy the next one. If not, I certainly wouldn't buy another simply to find out how the subplots are linked.Other writers delve deeper into characterization than Ms. Hoff but her portrayal of Renny stole my heart. I look forward to reading the next book simply to see what happens to this young girl.All in all, the book is easy to read and generally enjoyable if you like historical romance."
2,"Not the greatest,","This book isn't on my favorites list. To me, the plot was confusing and took to many twists. And at some points the word choice was unskillful and didn't have a fluency it needed. It might just be because this book is truely for younger readers then I am, I'm an odd rater, or this book isn't the best in the world. I really just didn't get hooked at all. I'm not really requesting it for tweens or over. Or for anyone honestly. I request 'The last dog on earth' much more then this book. I liked that one MUCH better."
5,The only book you need to read!,"The Messiah Seed has given me an entirely new way of looking at myself, life, God and spirituality. Each and every page contains tremendous food for thought. Each time I revist a page, I receive new perspectives which expand and challenge any limits which I have placed on myself. A must-read for all!"
3,Good product - bad manufacturing,Bachmann must have lost quality control or let it run overseas where nobody cares... as long as it breakes and customers would be replacements.First of all the tracks are supposed to be polished at points where moving rail diverts train. Harsh metal was good in 70 and 80 in Eastern Europe in HO products - that is few decades ago. Also diverter rails are not supposed to have slop and they are not supposed to leanunder weight of heavier locomotive.Locomotives thses days have very preciseand razor sharp wheels. They cut between regular rail and diveriting rail easily if they are not made precisely. That causes trains to derail on crossovers and turnovers from Bachmann. Frogs must be made with better precision as wellThese parts used to be better from the manufacturer... 5 years ago. I might switch to Kato system.
4,The trilogy continues,"Mara of the Acoma, in trying to extend her family's wealth and prestige in the Empire, buys Midkemian slaves at the market. Falling in love with the slave Kevin, opens her eyes to how unstable Tsurani Society really is.Raymond Feist and Janny Wurts continue to work dynamically together to create a series that is exciting and challenging. Though there is more heart stopping action in conparison to Daughter of the Empire, Servant of the Empire concentrates on the romance between Ruler and slave, leaving it not as gripping as the first. However saying this, Servant of the Empire is still a very recommendable book and had me pursuing Mistress of the Empire."
1,The beginning of the end.,"This is where the series starts to decline. After exploring the exciting and phenomenally detailed Kelewan culture in the first volume, we're now presented with the concept of Mara becoming westernized by her slave. This concept was, at least to me, utterly unbelievable. It smacks of the authors moralizing instead of just describing the Kelewan society as they did in Daughter."
4,"Challenging, but good.","I listened to some interviews with Iain Murray on ninemarks.com. In one interview, he discussed this book and I was extremely intrigued. I am 100% on the side of ecumenism with Murray and Dr. Lloyd-Jones. This book is good to let you know the historical aspect of Evangelicalism. Murray didn't really attempt to apply in a typical manner. But it is extremely applicable if you see how others have gone wrong. I think we should read this, and others like it, with a sense of humility. We need to weigh tough topics like this with God's infallible Word and nothing else. I believe Murray stays true to the Word. If you're interested, I would suggest the interviews [...] to see if this is worth it. The interviews are extremely worth it."
3,Little going forward,"Moderately enjoyable but at two discs of a fifth volume this does not have all the content needed to truly represent its theme since Mehldau has often sounded more focused or frenzied prior, here maintaining a cumulative effect of guised-up, superfluous searching."
4,Beaded car seat,This seat supportsyour back and keeps you cooler in Summer. Been using these type of seats for a decade and plan to continue using this type as long as they are available
5,Best commentary on Luther available.,"This book is really head and shoulders above any other work on Luther and his theology. No one else brings out the radicality of Luther's thought better than Ebeling. Of special note is Ebeling's exposition of Luther's hermeneutic, his method of interpreting the Bible. A chapter in my Ph.D dissertation was on Luther, and this book helped more than anything except Luther's own texts. I wouldn't be too worried about the so-called technical vocabulary; this is no more technical or difficult than any other substantive work on Reformation theology."
5,Great show,"For someone who does not watch much television, this show is great. Even though it seems to get a little old with the ""let's find an expert or I know just the guy/gal for this item I found' which became the undeniably worse part of Pawn Stars; Storage Wars is certainly uplifting, if all is true, in that you can find some of the most interesting things in people's old junk and trash. That aspect, the potential to win big, outshines the rest of the show, even the somewhat ridiculous bickering between the show's stars. The fighting gets old and much of the show becomes a bit too formulaic but the sheer joy of watching people bid and win (or lose) ont he unknown is just amazing. Which is why I still give this show and season 5 out of 5. I want MORE."
4,Great Show - Bad DVD Release System,"Love the show, but what's with the weird release system by A&E.; Volume 2? Is there a Volume 1 or is Season 1 considered Volume 1? Freakin' Weird A&E; Board Room Execs!The packaging is no help - what you have here are the first 14 episodes of Season 2. A Volume 3 will be released on July 17, 2012 and my best guess is this will be the rest of the Season 2 episodes. What's here is great, but A&E; should've just stated on the packaging, Season 2 Volume 1! Besides that, it's worth picking up if you love the show."
4,Great resource for those doing battle with weeds,This reference guide aids in identification of weeds at all stages of growth. The easy to read text is complemented by excellent photographs. A must have if you need to know what the weed is.
2,A contractor from Minnesota,Although this book did have some good information to share on the basics i.e. good record keeping practices and procedures. It was geared towards the retail indistry only. I found the book to be quite dated. (early 90s). It took the cash register and paper approach to record keeping as opposed to any mention of computerized systems and methods available. I'm also suspisious of the Federal tax record keeping requirements etc. As this information provided could also be out of date.
1,A MOST Distorted Recording!,"Actually, the reason I am cruising on Amazon for ""La Resurezione"" is that I bought this disc at [local store]. The music is tantalizingly delightful, but the recording is more distorted than the most distorted vintage disc I own, rendering this set of highlights basically unlistenable, unless you turn the speakers toward the wall with all the treble off! The other highlights from ""Messiah"" are heavy-handed to boot. This is NO bargain, even at this price."
1,WARNING - NOT A BOOK!,"Caveat emptor! Despite the description above, this is not abook, paperback or otherwise. It is a CD of music, information onwhich can be found in the music section at Amazon..."
5,The Winterhaven Solution,"The Winterhaven Solution is a marvelous piece of modern-day fiction. Part of what makes it so is the heightened reality of its situations. This reader was always there with the cast of characters, sharing in all the action. The people we meet are all so very real. Even though our heroine, Rebecca, is a world-class concert pianist, she's very accessible and easy to fall in love with. Likewise with Horne, her ultimate hero - larger than life and there to identify with. The background of hate groups, so prevalent in today's world, produces the filthiest bunch of neo-Nazis you're ever likely to meet. Early on they commit a serious error by murdering Rebecca's sister on the eve of her wedding (part of a master plan to kill Jewish brides.) Rebecca schemes to get Horne, the ex-lion hunter to join her in tracking down the killers and we move forward from there. The unpredictable plot twists and turns are ever fascinating right up to the rip-roaring finale. This was one great read!"
1,DON'T BUY IT!,It's cheap (on sale) on purpose. This thing burns WAY too hot on low. My chili boiled all night and now I have to fix it.
1,rival crock pot,"after 5 or 6 uses the crock developed a crack on the bottom, it can be felt inside and out. Rival only responded once to my inquiries. Will not purchase another Rival product because the customer service is at best useless and non-existent. Please note-one star was too much."
2,Not thrilled,"I purchased this same model from Walmart. Now, it might have just been the particular box I chose but the locking handle tab was broken off and getting the lid hinged and unhinged is practically impossible.The box had not been opened nor was it damaged in any way so I believe the slow cooker was just poorly made.Even though I didn't purchase this through Amazon, I wouldn't recommend buying it."
5,Casio Watch,"I had this watch previously. It's very good if you want more schedules rather than a lot of phone numbers. You can do both. But, it gives you the choice of substituting the reminders instead of the telephone nuumbers."
5,Databank watch/Casio,"My Data Bank Watch DBC310-1 was exactly what I ordered and received. The old Databank 150 started to fail after about 12 years of service. I ordered the new Databank 300 to replace the 150 & it is the Exact same watch with 2x the memory. I didn't have to read the instruction book because it operates the same as old watch. I was lucky, I was able to retrieve my list of phone numbers from the old watch, and put them on the new watch. One more thing, I would like to see Casio Data Bank with Solar power and Atomic time keeping.I received the new watch in a timely fashion. Pleased with the product and service. thanks"
3,Maker's Diet Book Review,"There is considerable redundancy throughout the book.Because adhering to the guidelines in this book would be a considerable life change, I emailed the author/author's company with several questions. The questions were answered in a commercial manner, i.e., not in a personal manner. One of my major concerns was about the intake of supplements... there is no differrence in the intake of supplements for any of the 3 phases of the diet from the initial phase to the maintenance phase... one would think that once the body has been purged using the supplements, and a person following the diet is eating organic and healthy foods, that the intake of supplements would decrease as the need to cleanse the body would not be as great. The answer I received seemed strictly commercial in that the intake of the supplements is what is recommended. I have not made a decision to try the diet as yet."
3,Good elimination diet,"We have not tried the diet yet, but it seems like a good idea. The recipes are sparse, especially for family's with picky eaters. Some of the recipes are also not written out very well and if I didn't cook a lot already I would have a very hard time following them. It also requires a lot of extra money to be spent on supplements and vitamins. However, with all that said, it's an easy to follow elimination diet that I can see being very useful to help areas of health that we often complain the most about."
4,Vital for anyone interested in Boston's Tribal divisions,"After reading Carroll's American Requiem, I was eager to read this novel. The story revolves around the ethnic divisions in Boston and the experience of Irish Americans in particular in the Kennedy era. Carroll's characters are not as predictable as some, although their experience is representative. The dynamic between the two main characters is interesting, and the textual flow keeps you thinking. I recommend this novel to anyone who is of Boston Irish heritage, or finds the ward politics of that time period enthralling!"
2,Awful,"I give this two stars because if you absolutely had to you could probably digest this. I, fortunately, had something else and was not forced to endure this slop.Though it smells sweetly of ginger, the overall flavor is bland, the paneer is mush, and the peas have that ""from a tin can"" aroma that turns my stomach inside out.If you don't have a way to freeze and reheat your meals and you just GOTTA have Indian, I guess this is fine, but there are other items by other manufacturers that are so, so much better!I recommend instead trying Amy's Spinach Paneer, which was what I reached for when three not-so-tasty bites of this told me there was no way I was gonna be able to eat it. The Amy's brand is frozen, but the food is really great and keeps me happy between visits to my favorite Indian restaurants."
2,TastyPlastic,"I did not like this at all. Although the Peas and Paneer looks really good, they taste like the pouch they come in. The rice was undercooked and had a plastic feel to them as well."
2,"Bland, light on the paneer part","I bought a 6-pack of these after sampling TB's Vegetable Supreme, which is pretty good. These, however, have no taste, and as such I'm now stuck with 5 packs :( The tiny little pieces of paneer are in an unflavored sauce that has no bite to it whatsoever.All in all I'm pretty disappointed. I won't be ordering this flavor again. And I had such high hopes :("
5,An all time favorite time travel novel,"Mastodonia is a short, uncomplicated novel written in Simak's inimitable style and by any objective standard, it's not a great book. But for some reason, I love it. The call of an unspoiled Earth that a few people can have all to themselves, the adventure of travelling to the age of the dinosaurs...somehow this made me forget the questions I should have been asking about why they didn't even try to open a door to anywhen else in time.I have reread this book literally hundreds of times through the years, usually in one sitting and the only reason I don't do it more often is that it's not available for Kindle. It's a great read."
1,A Disservice to Those Serious About Getting into Print,"We'll keep this brief:This book opens with beginner material, then bypasses how to write and jumps into the wishful thinking stuff that pre-occupies most new writers (getting published and the aftermath). Somewhere, the authors (and editors who probably jumped in with their ideas) either lost or decided to dump ""the hard part.""In doing so, they've addressed a market that consists mostly of people who will never write a book.Otherwise, the little tips and such are cute, but why bother? Ah, what can you expect from a computer book outfit?Scan it if you must, then put it back on the shelf."
1,this is for the ridiculous price,"13 bucks for 2 songs !!!!!!!!!actually,its 1 good song and a throwaway.and they wonder why everyone is dl'ing............."
2,Reader Beware,"Be sure to read other material than just this when making dietary decisions, especially if you are pregnant, may become pregnant, are a nursing mother or plan to include your children on the Hallelujah or any other vegan diet.Chet Day is a former employee of Hallelujah Acres who now maintains his own web site. Google it for important insight into the dangers of following this diet.Please get the whole picture and don't be led down the primrose path."
2,Mostly a political piece,"Bracey seems more interested in supporting those he loves (people in public education) than he does in presenting an objective view of the use of statistics. His examples of the poor use of statistics are from those of opposite positions from him. After he has refuted their research, he then mentions research of those on 'his side' that come to different conclusions. Interestingly, he never shows any details of that research, so the reader can't see if they also did anything inappropriate."
3,Very good but ...,"The DVD is a perfect 10, but the team that filmed the event is zero points.Change angle all the time, very bad.Still it's great to see these great musicians together."
3,"Aaaah, not bad, not bad at all.","Invading Japanese warlords threaten Korea. Their mission is to kidnap and destroy all the country's Ninja Warriors, especially the ""Ninja Enforcer,"" master Lee Tung. Two of the master's best students are women--one American, the other Chinese. Both of them end up on a mission to rescue the kidnapped master. What follows is some of the most electrufying martial arts action ever witnessed on the screen!"
2,Made in China,"In comparison with other nozzles available, it looked like it was better made, but after reading the 1 star review here, I'm not sure that it will hold up. I am replacing a brass nozzle that I have had for 30 years. I'm getting a little older and the trigger nozzle looked easier to manipulate than the twist on-off brass nozzles. No where in the specifications does it say it is Made in China. I'm including that information in my review for those who think that information is important."
1,Melnor Titanium series,I have had this hose end pistol grip spray attachment for about 18 months.This morning the thing fell apart ( the black end & gold colored part separated from the grey/silver body.)I'm glad I was there to turn the hose off - could have been quite a flood!It looks like just a press fit .Can't push it back together & expect it to stay.Junk
2,Pewter Baby Rattle,There is no option on this page for the Pewter Baby Rattle for me to buy it or add it to my shopping cart. What is going on? I want to buy this right away!
1,Not Bond!,"I have read a few of Gardner's Bond books and have liked them as escapist fare, but this book is poorly plotted and the relationship between Bond and ""Flicka""(?)was insipid. Can you imagine a James Bond who is called a ...well let's just say the phrase was so inappropriate for Bond that I felt like I was reading James Bond by way of Beavis and Butthead. Weak."
5,"Worth it for the ""shwag"" and the Soundtrack","The soundtrack to this series is AMAZING. Simply AMAZING. I love the first OST soundtrack that came with the first box set and I look forward to the second.I am so thrilled with the dub of this series. Funimation has done an amazing job with the production of the whole thing. I have not been disappointed with the voice acting at all.I've seen the whole series in Japanese, but STILL get excited when new ""American/English"" episodes come out."
2,cheezy,ok im not saying anything too new here - but this single sounds like cher's believe meets stardust's music sounds better with you. Its a very different sound from Homework. I thought that album was more hardcore house and had a very underground feel to it. This on the other hand is top 40 club music. If Daft Punk are planning on releasing a full album i hope it doesnt all sound like this. might even be good if they leave this one off it.
2,Promising...but never made it :(,"About the first 20 seconds of One More Time are actually worth listening to. The brass sample started a catchy track,but stops, and just has a vocoded voice (Romanthony)for around 3 min! This is nothing like the Daft Punk from Homework, and its not even house, mearly some vocoded voice over a drum loop. Save yourself the money and buy Homework, or the Stardust single."
3,This is daft punk??,"This track was a disappoitment for me. It's catchy but little else, thomas bangalter obviously wanted a big pop hit and sunk low to get it. Sound's like a cross between Eifel 65 and Cher's ""beleive""...."
1,not what it says it is!,"this is not reversible! i wanted a scarlet singlet for a PL meet and when i saw this one, I thought ""hey, why not have both?! maybe I'll get bored with scarlet in time"". I got the blue one, the scarlet is not for wearing on the outside. I don't have a long torso, and it fits poorly on the upper body. It is too small, although it's fine on the lower-body."
3,pearl diver,A sad movie...it isn't acted very well but that could just be the budget. I am sure the story is good but the movie slaughters it.I don't really recommend it for anyone but if you just NEED some entertainment and have nothing else to watch....
2,Very watery; weak flavor,"Title says it all. This product ""pours"" out of the pouch almost like a soup. I was very disappointed in the taste, but I'll make myself finish the six. I much prefer the Bombay Potatoes and Jaipur Vegetables."
5,MORE FUN THAN A BARREL OF MONKS,"Oh ya gotta get this one. Early LaVey before his post mortem debunking by his daughter Zeena. And the naked ladies are just right for a serious nip and tuck, making this saga a saggy one. Warts and all. And...is that nerdy kid Isaac Bonewitz--the author of Real Magic and the first guy to graduate from Berkeley with a degree in Magic and Thaumaturgy? Stay tuned and find out. Take out the chalice of bourbon and sit back and enjoy, plus you get some great bonus material. A guy with the worst hairpiece in the world watches a tv (that's television) stripper back in the days when cellulite was a turn on, you get trailers for movies that should be seen only by people who live in trailers (...) It just don't git no better'n this. Ave Satanas and Hava Nagila and turn up the volume cause good old ASL tends to mumble a bit."
1,a well photographed disappointment,"this book will appeal to photographers but few others. it is mostly arty pictures of rivers, swamps, plantation workers and dogs. there are only a few pictures of the houses and very little insight into plantation life. there is virtually no text. this book seems to be a vanity publication for the photographer. i returned my copy in the next mail."
4,Epic conclusion to the series,"Every review will tell you how great this anime is, and the EPIC conclusion to an already great story should come as no surprise. This edition comes with collector's booklets that contain lots of character art and backgrounds, perfect for any big fan of the show. Be sure to look for the Manga series as well, which has a slightly different storyline and continues well beyond what the series covers."
1,Quality problems of Suunto KB-20,"The floating marker is not balanced, so if you put the compass in horizontal position, the moving part of the compass is touching the glass. In flight, I need to change the angle of the compass all the time in order to read it, but for each direction, I need to have a different angle, so it is almost impossible to read. I had lot of compasses before, and I decided to buy a ""good"" one because I need more precision, but I comitted a big mistake choosing this one."
3,Watch OK . . . no instructions for band,"Watch is OK. I wanted legible face also easy to see at night. This watch has that. Nice enough wrist band, but absolutely no instructions, not even a clue, on how to remove (or add) links. Fortunately, I found adequate clues on line."
3,Obviously not fancy,"I read a review saying that this was great for business or whatever. While it is a nice watch, it is very obviously just plain metal as well. It is easy to notice that it isn't as expensive as it might look like in the first glance"
4,snappy gear,"Got my new watch...looks are great. immediately i noticed the picture of the watch posted is different in 2 ways; the blue background is more subdued in person and the gold accenting is ""polished"" not brushed as suggested in the photo.It is easy to set.The calander window is very small and if is an important feature you might want to consider another model. The biggest difficulty was with the band design. If you take your watches to a jeweller for band adjustment then there is no issue here.If you are a self ""doer"" like me..DO NOT ATTEMPT to take links from this band. It's a very complicated design, requiring special tools and knowledge.I managed to do it...but now have a one dented link coupling...aaarghh!..But now for the pleasnt supprise..the arms and numbers have ""luminous paint"" which makes them viewable in the dark.No need for back lighting! Very happy overall"
2,Good watch but not if you like your arm hair.,"Look, I'm not the hairiest guy in the whole world, but the links really pull out your arm hair! Kind of a shame considering the excellent reliability."
3,nice watch but doesn't quite deliver,"I was really taken by the photo because of the handsome boldness of the design, or is it bold handsomeness? It had a very elegant and masculine look, two areas where I could use any help I can get. My only tiny reservation was the font of the numbers. They sort of look like plastic magnetic letters a child would put on the refrigerator. When it arrived the colors were grand but the number font - especially because of their size - was in the end intolerable. So back it went. If the font was a little more refined and understated I would have kept it and given 5 stars. As an aside, the metal is very light and edges are a little rough compared to a higher end watch, it was a bit cheap feeling, but that is to be expected at this price so no stars off for that. It is, after all, better to look good than to feel good. BTW can I give a shout-out to watch shopping on Amazon? Good times..."
4,Special relationship,"This is a book that Robyn Sisman around 10 years ago before chick-lit had became a huge phenomenon and it recently got re-released. I've read Robyn's other novels and I loved them. But I have to say that ""Special Relationship"" just doesn't seem to have that same magic as her other novels do. I had a hard time getting into the book and staying interested in it. It took me over a week to read and finish the novel, which is a rarity for me. It's not like the characters of Jordan, Annie, and Tom were bad and not likeable but it was just lacking something. The backdrop of youth in the era of hippies and the Vietnam war are interesting and is kind of like what the world is experiencing again at this moment.So even though ""Special Relationship"" is not my favorite Robyn Sisman novel, it's still worth reading if you've read and enjoyed any of her other novels."
5,Amazing relief,"I was skeptical, but desperate. I tried these patches and the relief was amazing. No more swollen feet; no more uncomfortable legs. Now I just use them when the symtoms come back and I get relief everytime. I tried other brands, but none of them did as well."
3,Slavery,"In the movie the Plantation owner father's a child with one of his slaves. She dies in labor and the child is taken to the Church. Where the Pastor finds the baby, he and his wife end up raising her. No one knows she is Black.The Plantation owner involved with a women who really wants to be with his son. When the son comes home and meets the Pastor's daughter, he likes her. The end up getting married and she gets pregnant. When the baby is born he has very dark skin, the woman doesn't understand how this could happen.When her husband sees the baby he thinks his wife cheated on him. He chases after her. She runs with the baby. Shots ring out..... His father rushes to the scene and informs him that his wife didn't betray him she is actually HIS SISTER."
5,"Witty and smart history of ""the world's first woman""","Eve is a wonderful book. I expected it to be informative but dry, and instead it was lively and funny and entertaining. Norris offers an eclectic history of not just the figure of Eve, but many of her sisters in crime--Pandora, Delilah, Lilith--and provides a bracing account of these good and bad sisters and mothers through the ages. It's also a gorgeous book, with great color and b+w illustrations throughout.It's tops on my holiday gift list, especially for friends interested in religion and women's history. What can I say, I loved it."
3,Not bad,"I have a Milwaukee Circular Saw with the original Endurance blade.I was cutting Hardi siding with it. Endurance blade kicks up a lot of dust and and chips, etc. The cuts weren't all that bad though, a little rough around the edges, but then I came on here and read about this HardiBlade, and read the reviews on less dust, etc.I didn't notice that for me. It's still kicking up dust and chips. It may be a tad less, but not worth mentioning in my opinion.The cuts were slightly smoother though.So if I had to do it all over again, I would save my money...unless I was cutting these boards all day every day."
4,Right Smart Writing,"Where this book differs from many style manuals is in its light-hearted approach. It features cartoons, quips, ambiguously worded phrases, and clever quotes to reinforce the many valid pointers contained within its pages.It will not make a successful writer out of an untalented illiterate, (no resource will), but most readers will find a few tips to improve their writing quality. Whether looking for clarification on a particularly sticky dilemma or just in the mood for an intelligent chuckle, Jan Venolia's slim reference warrants a skim."
1,"Not as good as the original,","Clunky, hard to open and close, and a tad fatter than this item used to be. My original lasted and lasted ... but recently was lost. Truly miss it compared to this one."
2,One serious mistake and one minor irritant,"Serious mistake:The author chose to reduce the traditional level of heat in these recipes to accommodate a bland North American palate. Wrong move. He should have left them painfully spicy and suggested ways to reduce the heat if desired. As a result, I can't give the book more than two stars.Minor irritant:What I thought was the vegetarian section turned out to be a handful of veggie dishes listed within a chapter full of meaty dishes. I should have read the chapter title more carefully- ""Rice and Beans, Vegetarian Main Dishes, and Side Dishes"" turns out to be mostly meat...even the rice & beans have meat in them."
1,I HAVE ONLY HEARD 1 SONG OFF THE ALBUM....,"I only heard 1 song off the albumBut sometimes i waitI dont want something i cant give back, i like to give but i dont want to give backBetter save your money, i heard a song i didnt like, i only heard 1 song off the album, better save your money"
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME!!!,ONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME!!! YOU NEED TO HEAR IT ON VINYL!!! IT'S LIKE HEARING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME AGAIN!!!
5,One of the best albums OF ALL TIME,"It's funny how people discrespect one of the best and most influential Rock albums of the 20th century. This album was truly unique upen its release and you can hear how many bands tried to copy its style and sound.The album kicks of with the classic ""Smells like a teen Spirit"" every rock fan in the world knows this song, it doesn't matter how old you are, you've heard this song before. ""In bloom"" ""Come as you are"" ""Lithuim"" ""Drain you"" are all timeless rock classics. But all the songs are great, if you're a rock fan this album is a necessity."
3,"All right, i've listened to it. What do you want me to do?","I really wanted to listen to this album when I heard that it had been named the #1 album of the 90's. Since I liked ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""Come As You Are"", I borrowed it from my friend. I listened to it and wondered 'why do people love this album so much?' Believe me, this album is nothing to get excited over. I mean sure it has it's good points, but come on. Are you really telling me that this is the best album of the 90's. Live's ""Throwing Copper"" or The Offspring's ""Americana"". Now those are great 90's albums. But Nirvana fans and critics, I'VE LISTENED TO IT, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? I like some of the songs on here, but it's nothing I would get excited over or anything I would jump up and down about."
4,good album? of course. stuff of legend? hardly...,"C'mon, wake up and admit it. The stars were PERFECTLY aligned for this album. There are more emotional, meaning of life, sick of all this s**t albums out there. It just came at the perfect time (I'm not saying it's not a good album though, because it is).If you can define your existence in the lines ""a mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido"", I think some serious reconsideration is in order."
5,The Best (Nirvana) CD ever !,"Nevermind was my first CD of Nirvana and for me it is absolutely the best Album ever. I don't mean just the best Nirvana CD, it is the Album of the Albums. Every single song on this disk is absolutely great. If I can give you an advise: do at least one thing right in your live and buy this CD.btw: After Nevermind I bought every other Nirvana CD that was available and became a big fan."
5,BEST ROCK CD OF ITS TIME,"In 1991, this was the CD to have, i still listen to it often. ITS A DOPE CD, GET IT!!!"
1,Nevermind has stagnated modern music,"The music industry's in such a sorry state these days. Nevermind has frozen music for the past twelve years. The music industry is stagnant. It ain't going anywhere. That is THE sign that we need something fresh. Everything that comes out nowadays is hawked as ""alternative rock"" when it's as disgustingly popular and manufactured as Backstreet Boys pop. So-called ""alt. rock"" isn't alternative when it's the norm. Every kid on the block wishes they were lonely and alienated because that's how MTV tells them to feel. So what's the first step they do after listening to MTV's brainwashing? They go to Tower Records and buy Nirvana's Nevermind on CD for $20. Kurt didn't start a revolution, he started a mass pollution of purposely poorly-produced hate rock.Here's some folksy rock & country albums I recommend instead:Willie Nelson: The Demo SessionsRobert Clyne & the Peacemakers: Honky Tonk UnionMelissa Etheridge: Yes I amThe Refreshments: The Bottle & Horses"
1,When music went bad,"A mosquito, my libido? COME ON! If this guy is a genius, then the term has been considerably watered down. Please. ZERO STARS."
2,hardly the innfluencel album of the last 20 years,sorry to break all you mtv generation hearts but i rembember when this came out working in a record store and wondering what all the hype was about . sure it was better than all the fluff/hair metal bon jovi stuff that mtv was playing but hardly the best thing to come along in the last 20 + years as many would have you belive do your self a favor and go listen to JANES ADDICTION'S- NOTHING SHOCKING OR SOUNDGARDEN'S- LOUDER THAN LOVE both far better than nevermind as far as the grunge thing i'd say ALICE IN CHAINS- FACELIFT was far more intresting and DIRT far better than nirvana's- nevermind sorry i didnt belive the hype nor do i belive it now over nirvana or nevermind.
3,Smells like fried brains and gunpowder,"Like ""Never Mind the Bollocks"", this is a handful of world-beating singles packaged with a boatload of abrasive filler. How any band regurgitating 1983-vintage Replacements (with heroin substituted for alcohol) got credited with a musical revolution (which lasted all of four years) is beyond me. Don't get me wrong - I own it, along with forty or fifty records it parrots."
3,"Nevermind was a good album by a good band, Pearl Jams better","'Nevermind' was a good album, & Nirvana was a talented band, Kurt Cobain was a good song-writerPearl Jam & Eddie Vedder were simply better much better, made much better albums, & were much more talented, interesting, & intelligent& im happy the guys from Pearl Jam influenced Nirvana enough to the point that Kurt Cobain could write this album because of his inspiration from them"
5,Awesome cd!,"This whole cd is really great, Nirvana is a great group, if you like grunge music, buy it!"
5,"This album is pretty good, mmmkay...","This album is very good, mmmkay. When I first put the headphones on my ears, I was like ,""Man this is pretty good, mmmkay!!!"" and then I told everyone to not do drugs because drugs are bad mmmkay. Did you know that Kurt Cobain killed himself with a shotgun while under the influence of heroin, mmmkay? That's why you shouldn't do drugs, because drugs are bad, mmmkay.Smells Like Teen Spirit is a great song, mmkay!!!"
2,"AFTER HEARING PEARL JAM'S ""TEN"" ALBUM, THIS ISNT SO GOOD","I heard of Pearl Jam before I heard of Nirvana... & got the Pearl Jam album ""Ten"" 1 yr & 1/2 before I finally picked up ""Nevermind""...Sorry Nirvana fans... but after you get so used to listening to ""Ten"" by Pearl Jam... ""Nevermind"" just doesnt live up to it.Besides, Pearl Jam were more original than Nirvana... Nirvana was just a rehash of the Pixies, but Pearl Jam were really doing things other bands didnt do before."
4,Nirvana Nevermind cd,My 14 year old son is a Nirvana Fan. He likes the cd. Brings back memories for me. Thanks.
2,"Nirvana, Only Good In Their Time","Nirvana was a great band for it's time, but they only have 3 good songs by today's standards, number one, two, and five. Sure, they were good in the past but come on people, if they were a new band now they would [stink]. I hate people in my age group that just love Nirvana and old bands like them. Nevermind was their best one which was made in 1991. Nobody gives credit for Rage Against the Machine's first album that was harder than Nevermind and was only made 1 year later! And almost all the songs on that album are still great by today's standards! Now that is truly amazing!"
1,F*ck teenage agnst and get up and do something!,"Think Nirvana really were the ""saviors"" of music? Well, they might have been for jock rock, but because of them, they've managed to stamp out all forms of creative music. Now all we're left with is a bunch of misogyny sent over the radiowaves. Kurt and company have definitely had a negative impact on music in the past 13 years. Here's some classic bands/artists/rappers' albums and singles you're not likely to hear ever again because of Nirvana (that is, if you're old enough to remember them at all)...Kris Kross ""Gonna Make You Jump"" (single)Basement Jaxx ""Rooty""C+C Music Factory ""Gonna Make You Sweat""Ace of Base ""The Sign""Nine Inch Nails ""Pretty Hate Machine""The Real McCoy ""Another Night""Coolio ""Gangsta's Paradise"" (single)Fun Lovin' Criminals ""Come Find Yourself""Technotronic ""Pump Up the Jam""Cypress Hill ""Insane in the Membrane"" (single)Go listen to your Good Charlotte and sulk about how you can't get a rid to the mall, you Nirvanites!"
1,Possibly The Most Overrated Album of All Time,"I am still amazed at the magnitude critics go to jump on the Nirvana bandwagon to this day. When Rolling Stone named the top 100 guitarists of all-time and rated Kurt Co""pain"" higher than Eddie Van Halen I reached my meltdown point. This band is the worst thing that happened to music. At least Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters have a sense of humor and play some good tunes. Nirvana had it's day and it's time to move on. Does anyone remember how to play the guitar? We now refer to the singer of a band as a vocalist because no one sings anymore. Thanks Nirvana for a whole lotta nothing!"
1,oh my god,"im 13, and i wasnt even born when this came out. it sucks, this music is dying fast - the alternative image in rock is crumbling to a joke and people are goin to stop spiking their hair up and listening to a joke. grow your hair and bow down and worship metal"
4,"NIRVANA... dave grohl, kurt cobain... legends..","WHAT??! how can anyone possibly NOT give this anything but 5 stars?? this is without a doubt the best alt rock album of the 90z if not ever. nevermind the rest, this IS THE BEST!"
2,in retrospecto,"Okay when it came out (beat ""Bleach"" anyway), but looking back? Look hard enough and you'll see a generic corporate rock album. It's got to be one of the most front-loaded albums of all time. Seriously, have you ever heard any songs off side B on the radio? The first six songs are the singles. Even ""Thriller"" mixed it up better than that. Also the fuzzed-out boy band photos - in one Kurt is giving us the bird! What a scamp! In all honesty, I change the station when one of these songs come on. I'm tired of them, and you don't get tired of classics."
2,Trash,"Crappy Vocals, Crappy Guitar work, Overhyped lyrics. Rockers are entertainers not poets. This is the band that killed rocks spirit and drove it to depression and misery. Thanks to this and the other grunge bands, rock n roll is dead. No wonder so many people started listening to hip hop in the 90's."
1,"Did I purchase a ""USED"" vinyl record posing as ""NEW""","I rated Nirvana's - Nevermind,new vinyl,""Hate It"" because,I now have ""TWO"" records I don't want to open because I can't get the answer to my question to Amazon! Is it ""NEW or USED""?I received the first record without the usual ""Shrinkwrap or Cellophane Wrap"" protecting the album cover,and to prove that it is sealed and ""NEW"",it did come with a sealed oversized clear plastic that is similar to the protective sleeve found at record stores on ""USED"" and opened vinyl records!After my first inquiry,I just received another ""NEW"" record without any answer to my ""NEW or ""USED"" question,it also is in the same condition as the first!My first inquiry was dated 12/15/11, and patiently waiting for any reponse from my ""Second"" attempt to resolve this transaction."
5,nirvana the best band and the best music,i think nirvana is the best ... band ever do you know whos better didn't think so all those other bands execpt for a few ...!no lie all those who hate nirvana are ...
5,Excellent,"This is just a great cd by one of the best bands of the 90's. It has about 6 killer songs that even someone that isn't a fan of nirvana can enjoy (smells like teen spirit,in bloom,come as you are, lithium, polly) and 6 other songs that probably will only be appreciated by nirvana fans. My favorites on here are ""lithium"", ""something in the way"", ""on a plain"", and ""drain you"". The only negative thing I will say about this cd is that it can be really depressing, well for me at least."
3,Dear AFI: NIRVANA rocks. Go grow a pair,"This is a neutral review. NIRVANA's Nevermind isn't too special compared to the better alternative acts of the 90's, but it doesn't deserve all these needlessly negative reviews from the AFI guy. It's not like this CD is as bad as a Limp Bizkit album, people! It seems AFI is sour about Kurt Cobain's fame. I think it's horrible AFI is actually happy a fellow human being ended their life. Maybe AFI wishes he had the balls to do what Kurt did. Maybe AFI should grow a some. Hey Amazon... Is there any way AFI can be suspended?If you like NIRVANA, then check our POD's Satellite album. Slayer is cool too."
3,An ok album,"What can be said about this CD?First,in no way was Kurt gifted songwriter.His lyrics were average at best,and what he did was to hide his lack of talent for words behind abstract nonsense.It's an ok rocking album,no more and no less."
3,"Not bad, but what's so amazing?","What is so amazing about this c.d.? Everyone thinks that Nirvana is the greatest band ever and they are musical geniuses. Why? Why did Kurt Cobain even bother to write lyrics for these songs. You can't undersatnd anything he says and the last 6 songs are pretty much hurried noise. I must admit, though, tracks 1-6 are really good, but the rest of the album is (as I said before) hurried noise. After hearing that this was ranked the best album of the ninties, I was expecting at least most of the songs to be good. I was disappointed to find that only half of them were really good. There a couple other decent songs, though. THERE IS NOTHING AMAZING ON THIS C.D.! If you want some great alternative music get Live's ""Throwing Copper"" or Live's ""Secret Samadhi"". They have meaning and a vocalist you can understand."
5,Great album.,"I love how that kid named himself 'Sultans of Swing'. That's oneof my favorite songs by Dire Straits. But he needs to stop beingsuch a picky music lover. This album is terrific and has somegreat songs, In Bloom, Come As You Are, and Smells Like Teen Spirit. Get it, but avoid all albums from crappy bands like Metallica who suck really hard.Whirligig."
5,A Necessity,"cutting strait to the point- you need this album. if you like loud, teen anthems- then you have ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"". if you like more alternitive rock, you have the surf-sounding ""Come As You Are"". is you're into slower, deeper songs, then ""somthing In the Way"" is for you."
5,Breakthrough Record For Nirvana and Rock Music.,"Nevermind mixes the sound of punk rock and heavy metal to define a new style: Nirvana. Kurt Cobain, lead singer and songwriter, feels the album has radio friendly or pop sound. Even though, Nevermind is an excellent record. If you like punk, ""Come As You Are,"" but if you prefer heavy metal, ""Stay Away"" because Nirvana doesn't want your business. ""Drain You,"" track 6, has extreme energy; much like ""Aneurysm"" (heard on Teen Spirit single). If you enjoy this album please check other Nirvana albums (preferably Bleach and Incesticide)."
5,No doubt about it...,"...this was one of THE most influential albums of all time. Just listen to rock before this album, then listen to rock after this album. That's all that needs to be said. Except for Dave Grohl, none of the members of Nirvana were all that great on their respective instruments. Who cares! This album just completely reflected Kurt Cobain's attitude and views on life. Even thought it's a cliche, he was indeed the voice of a generation. One of the best songwriters and frontmen of all time."
3,It ain't all that...,"I just heard this disc for the first time yesterday, simply to see what all the fuss was about.Well, what's all the fuss about??Anybody can yell into a microphone, folks. My cat would sound better than this guy. Also, the chords he uses are cliched and overdone, the Sex Pistols did them much better, and those guys could barely even play!Still, there is a lot of troo emotion in these songs, and the drumber does lay down phat beats. However, if you're looking for da troo punk, I'd purchase harder-edged items like Blink-182, Boxcar Racer, and almost anything by Green Day, especially their later stuff like the song ""Time of Your Life,"" which will trooly make you cry.PEACE FROM THE EAST!!"
2,Teen Spirit: The only good Nirvana song.,"I find it strange that all the ""hardcore"" Nirvana fans out there say they love all their songs except for ""Teen Spirit"", which according to these fans, {stinks}. ""Teen Spirit"" is the song that got everyone into Nirvana in the first place (admit it!), so don't knock it. And yes, it IS one of Kurt's best songs ever, no matter how much you deny it. I think he really did like the song, but just said he didn't when it became popular. Besides, 1/4 of the songs strung together in the inlay are from SLTS, and the album title is named after it. Too bad I can't say Nevermind as a whole lives up to the coolness of Teen Spirit; if you think it will, I'm here to say this: It will never live up to that song. The person below who said this is the most overrated album ever is right; I can't think of a more overrated one."
1,Four classics. The rest: Awful.,"Nevermind is pretty good. Not great. There are some hum dingers of a song like Lithium and Teen Spirit that are just amazing. As for the ones I don't like: There are a lot. In Bloom was a very bad choice for a single, and Drain You always got on my nerves. Why wasn't Breed chosen as a single instead?! It's guitar crunch at its best, I tells ya. On a Plain was a single, but was only released limitedly, which is a shame because it blew In Bloom away. Anyway, there are four knock-'em-dead songs on here, but the rest are duds."
1,Hopelessly overhyped and overrated CD by a mediocre band,"This is, in essence, the album that dumbed down a generation and took music from talented, enthusiastic musicians to conceited slackers. From the much overused(and outdated) opening of ""Smells Like Tenn Spirit"" through all the obvious retro-pop nonsense that follows, Cobain and co. fail to come up with a single original moment(even their name is that of a 60's/70's group!) This album was sold soley by HEAVY MTV rotaion, and some pretentious ""music critic""'s imbecilic babble. Avoid at all costs!!!"
1,Kurt Cobain is Dead and he took Rock 'n' Roll with him,"Music critics may harp about Kurt Cobain's artistic angst and the lasting historical implications of this album, but the fact remains that every sick excuse for a rock album in this decade, from Pearl Jam's ""Vitalogy"" to Marilyn Manson's ""Mechanical Animals"" owes 90% of its inferiority to Nirvana. The proliferation of classic rock on the radio and twentysomethings at Eagles reunion tour and Steve Miller Band concerts owes itself to the disillusionment with modern music that such suicidal, self-indulgent wailing as is found on this album is bound to inspire. Do your ears and your soul a favor and stay away."
3,the mediocrity of this lp has to do with context/era in which it was released,"rather than bashing a band I have no vested interest in i would prefer talking about Kurt Cobain's seeming desire to be doing something other than making what he quickly determined was accessible pap. His perpetual mention of groups like the raincoats, kleenex, slits made me think he would have preferred being a woman several years older-doing music much less confining. the joke I suppose is on his fans-who somehow believed he was speaking for them-"
1,"It's called Endless Nameless, you hibachi!","Look how stupid and out-of-touch with reality Nirvana fans are. I'm not even a fan and I know the unlisted song is called ""Endless Nameless"". It's no secret, either. The song was accidentally left of the final inserts due to a printing error. The song plays on the same track as Something in the Way because of a pressing error at the disc plant. But I suppose you can leave it up to a bunch of stoned f*ck-ups who love a band as corporate as Nirvana to be so off their rockers that they randomly name things ""Mosquito Bite"". I recently heard an unlisted track of Pink Floyd's and dubbed it ""I am a pretentious f*ck up who likes to name things because I have no reason to find staples in my Chinese food""!"
2,Piss Poor Remaster!!,"Don't bother buying the Remaster! Stick with the original release.The only reason i didn't give this one star is because of all of the bonus material it comes with.I am sick and tired of the loudness war. Louder is not better!! This album when listened to in it's entirety fatigues your ears. Instead of having the dynamic range that Kurt originally intended for all of the songs on the album to have. It just drones on as one constant loud mess and instead of getting lost in the music, you get lost in daydreaming and forget to listen to the music.I just hope they don't ruin In Utero on it's 20th anniversary if they decide to remaster and re-release it. Hopefully they hand that job over to Steve Albini to remaster. I'd be more upset if they ruined In Utero."
5,OVERRATED,"Na, not really. I just wanted to see how many people would rate me as a bad reviewer after they read that. No, seriously, this is a rockin album. I mean, the first five songs are all probably on my top 100 list of the best songs of the 90s, even if we've all heard Smells Like Teen Spirit about a million times each. Breed rocks, Stay away is a great anthem, and Something in the Way is a pretty catchy song. I got it stuck in my head right now actually- sing it with me! Somethin in the way, mmm, mmm. Somethin in the way, yea, mm, mmmm. And the random Endless, Nameless at the end after they screwed up Lithium so many times is pretty awesome. RIP Kurt, and Krist to, since you havent done anything with your life since Kurt died. I'm obviously going to hell for that."
4,"Great Album, However MTV and Vh1 Make it more than it is.","Yes we can all agree thank God for this record. It came at the perfect time, 80's glitz was dying and something was needed to shake the world up. This album was a great step in the right direction, however where MTV and Vh1 fail to mention is that Soundgardens Badmotorfinger, Pearl Jams Ten, and Alice in Chains Dirt are an equal part of the equation. There is no doubt that this is a great record, just listen to Lithium or On a Plain and youll know you are listening to something special. Cobain wrote great tunes, not a very good guitarist, he didnt have to be though a 5min solo wouldnt fit in a Nirvana song. I was in my teens when this record came so Ill tell you first hand that this album was just one of at least 4 or 5albums that created the grunge scene, and they were all equally as good.Final Verdict..Good Strong Record, but not the Godly record that magazines and MTV tells you it is."
5,Yes!,Great album set with an awesome promotional aspect. Finally viynl is back and better than ever in this limited edition set.
5,nirvana smells like teen spirit,"Nirvana smelled like teen spirit and it never smelled better, who knew that the little nothings from bleach would rocket to stardom in one album? An excellent cd a must have for any cd collector!"
5,Got to pay respect,"This CD was defintly not Nirvana's best stuff. And it's way overrated (considering the fact that bands like soundgarden were also out at this time and had some pretty badass stuff out). But if it wasn't for this CD i wouldn't have even touched their second cd In Utero, which is really a much better CD not washed down and just reallly really good."
2,"One of the most overrated bands, and albums!","This band could not possibly be more overrated. Kurt's vocals are nothing special, and all these songs sound ridiculously similar. It is very rare for me to not like a rock/alternative band from the 90's, but I hate this. The songwriting is extremely simple and bad. Look at the band ""Barenaked Ladies"". Their lyrics are very talented and sophisticated, then take a look at these ones. I am only giving this 2 stars because the three decent tracks on here: ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", ""In Bloom"" and ""Come As You Are"". With these 3 acceptable tracks, this album leaves 9 boring, similar sounding, badly performed songs."
1,"Junk when it was all the rage, and junk now","My daughter stole this the other day from her mother in a group home in order to impress her boyfriend. But he was already in jail.It sounds like somebody breaking something, with somebody else yelling about it.Or a trucker jaking in a tunnel with a state trooper rear ending him.Or monkeys screaming on monkey island as they watch zoo visitors eaten by escaped bears.Someone told my daughter it's actually pretty good if you play it backwards. But for that, you need vinyl. Is it on vinyl?"
4,good but not as good as unplugged in new york,its a mint album but if you wan't something a bit less like smells like teen spirit and more likt about a girl buy UNPLUGGED IN NEW YORK which is in my opinion one of the best albums ever made. Email me with your views on this.
4,whatever,"I'm not gonna yell around about how people who don't like Nirvana don't recognize music and whatever. If you don't like it, you know, go your own way. Now, I'd like to say that if your glad Kurt died cause ""he was a loser"", well, you're the loser. Anyone who wishes ill of another is a ""loser."" Also, just cause no one knows what SLTS, or any of the songs, ""mean"", doesn't mean they're not music or art. Picasso didn't neccesarily ""mean"" anything with his art, yet it goes without a doubt that he was a great artist. This album is chock full of terrific music, with only 1 bad song: On A Plain. I mean, who can complain? Also, Kurt could play guitar, he just wasn't as good as some."
5,"Hmm, way too ahead of its' time","Ah, the celebrated Nevermind. There are a few sides which people SEEM to take when reviewing:-Cobain, man, he was STONED!-It sucked!-In Utero kicked this cd's sit-upon!-A classic, rebellistic view inside his mind in which he shared his feelings!I take none of these sides! They are all, (in my mind), somewhat incorrect.Nevermind is obviously the most popular Nirvana CD, as many of its' songs made it into the rock charts of that era. It was a good cd though.Pros-Creative lyrics-A ""heavier"" sound-Dark melodies and creative lines that i would never of thought-Plain heaviness and coolness, with the underground feel (whoa there, i only said feel, not that it is underground).Cons-Everyone has it (you are not special to own this cd)-Rather inconclusive guitar playing (ah, i guess this is what made it grunge . . .)All in all, good stuff.Then again, maybe not so good stuff.But for the 90's junkie, good start (or finish)."
3,LOUSY: KURT COBAIN NEEDS TO STOP SCREAMING,"This album is really noisy and overrated. The 4 good songs on the CD would be Smells Like Teen Spirit, In Bloom, Come As You Are, & Lithium. The rest of the CD is overrated, lousy, and noisy. They really don't make any guitar solos thus my mom loves this band. They're pretty good. I still recommend this album because Teen Spirit is one of my favourite songs of all time, and this came out when I was BORN! BUY IT...and just listen to those 4."
5,SO MANY GREAT SONGS IT'S UNBELIEVABLE!,That's it. If you don't own this CD right now there's something wrong with you. You're not a real rock fan if you don't own it. BUY IT!
3,Cobain A Great Guitarist? Decent.,"Okay, Nevermind is the best cd Nirvona ever made. K, we are clear there. Smells Like Teen Spirt, Come As You Are, and Lithuim are the best songs are the album, and the ones that will ""make you cream in your pants"". The rest pretty much junk, I mean useless filler, but that is pretty much how every album made past 1989 was. Now as Cobain goes as a guitarist, he is good but not the god people portray him to be. Mick Mars (Motley Crue), Slash (Guns N' Roses), Carlos Santana, Jimmi Hendrix, and the lead guitarist from Rush all put him to shame. Don't even get me started on Satriani and Stevie Ray Vaughan either"
5,The Art of Noise,"The sound of growing up lonely in a dying town hours away from anything. Turn up the volume, louder and louder, to drown out the boredom growing every day. Too smart to really forget what's happening, too lazy to do something about it. Keep yelling and screaming and drinking until you run into your fate. Rock of ages."
1,Smells Like Teen Spirit Is The Only Good Song,I'll give this CD 1 star because Smells Like Teen Spirit is a good song. Other than that I've heard Breed and it is what makesNirvana suck! Here's what to get.
1,Booorrrriiinnngggg,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz... 5 stars... for this - BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. This was one of the SUCKIEST albums I've ever heard!!!!!!!! :P
5,solid CD,"Jeff Angell is an extremely talented musician. Pretty much everything he touches is gold.He is a wonderful storyteller in his lyrics. Benjamin Anderson is brilliant on keys. Together they make some incredible music. Between Post Stardom Depression, The Missionary Position and their newest band together WALKING PAPERS, They have enough GREAT music to keep you happy for a good while. If you dig Jeffs voice, definitely check out The Missionary Position and Walking Papers as well. They are two bands that are still active and making incredible music!"
4,Hats off to the brave Resistance fighters!,"Unfortunately, because of their difficult Polish names, the main characters did not stick in my mind. I cannot remember who was who and who did what. Having said that, the young poeople who started the rebellion were brave and tough. How commendable for dying fighting, rather than just letting the Nazis lead them to the slaughter! Also, I was disgusted by the absence of help from the Polish underground and from the Allies. The Jews fought and died alone, with minimal help from the outside. I find the anti-Semitism of the Polish people to be cruel, barbarous and un-Christian: to dislike the Jews is one thing, but to turn them over to the Ghestapo and SS is another! Damn them!!!"
3,My two Casio watches have broken,"I simply love the telememo 30 Casio watch. It has all the functions that I want; 30 names w/phone nos & 5 alarms. I've had two of them but both of them have broken where the pin attaches the band to the watch. I'd rate the features a 5, but the dependability a 1, so the overall rating is a 3. I do not like the newer models as well as the telememo 30, which I am having trouble replacing."
3,WHO AM I?...,"When a young woman awoke to utter darkness, she had not a clue as to where she was or who she was. With the aid of a pocket flashlight, she quickly realized that she was on some cellar steps and that she was not alone. At the foot of the steps was the body of another woman who appeared to have been shot in the head.The young woman immediately left the cellar, not knowing where she was going and fearful for her life. By a most fortuitous circumstance, she runs into Miss Maud Silver, a retired governess turned private enquiry agent. For this young woman, this would turn out to be her first real bit of luck. Little did she know that she would very soon need the services of Miss Silver.While this is not the strongest book in the Miss Silver series of mysteries, it is the last book in the series. Therefore, fans of Miss Silver will most certainly want to read it and will derive a modicum of enjoyment from it."
1,Tool Great - Amazon Not so Much,"I ordered this tool because the model # listed is supposed to ship with Hardi Blade. This can be verified at the Hitachi web site. I received the model with out the ""H"" as in C7YA which includes the general contractor blade. I called customer service they sent me another - next day. Not only was it the same C7YA withOUT the right blade. Even better (sarcasm) it must have been previously returned - mixture of different packaging tape and someone wrote with a sharpie the suffix ""H"" after the C7YA.I'll give it 4 stars when I get the propper blade.I think someone has the wrong tool in inventory, because I can't find just the C7YA on the amazon site."
1,old hat (*yawn*) from a boomer,"How many times do we have to hear how over-sexed guys are as opposed to girls? As a college student I am approached by girls (and, truth be told, guys too) right and left asking me to go out or pestering me for an e-mail address, so this concept of the guys are the only ones chasing tail is so outdated it verges on the absolutely comical; needless-to-say, this pop is looking at today's youth through the bi-focals of HIS day and age, when 'looking up someone's skirt' was one of the most titillating pastimes of the ""Leave It to Beaver"" generation. Sad truth is, dad, guys just don't put girls up on pedestals for ANY reason these days, seeing as sex in *high school* (not to mention college) comes fairly cheap. Sorry to burst your bubble (and no, that wasn't a sex pun), but internet porn has made LOOKING up someone's skirt BORING."
3,nothing a mother couldn't tell,This was not as specific to the father's point of view as I would have hoped - most was common sense that an aware mother would give also.
3,Bood review,This book is more suited for young adults. It does not have too much depth to the story. I felt the book could be appreciated more if I had read the whole series. It does not stand alone very well.
4,"The hipster Spies With His Mystic Eye, Something That Begins With--Hip","A nice collection of 60s non-rock hits.Nancy Sinatra is well represented here.I long for the days of hip dudes in tuxes, slick chicks in gowns, martinis without guilt, & smoking indoors."
4,The Jacksons All Grown Up.,"After the Jackson 5 left Motown, they left behind a staggering array of top 10 bubble gum pop soul hits, that will forever maintain a place in pop history. In 1976 the boys made headlines, by signing with Epic records. They were now billed as the ""Jacksons"". During their tenure at Epic, they released 5 studio albums and 1 live album. This is the first time, that the best tracks from that era have been collected on one compilation. This cd proves to be an enjoyable listen, and further proves that some of this material has long been overlooked. Tunes like ""Enjoy Yourself"", ""Show You The Way"", ""Blame It On The Boogoie"", ""Shake Tour Body Down To The Ground"" and ""Can You Feel It"", remain some of the best music ever recorded by the Jacksons. The Funky duet between Michael and Mick Jagger, ""State Of Shock"", is also included here. If you own a best of compilation from the early years, this cd, will make the perfect companion collection. Highly recommended."
5,Essential But Not,"The Jacksons are my favorite group - hands down. I admit, every track on here is essential to their charting singles. But these guys have plenty of other astonishing tracks that didn't hit the radio. One thing I must admit regarding this disc is that it is great that we finally get the full 8 minute version of the powerful ""Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)"". Usually only the DESTINY album features it, while the hits compilations features the short 3 to 4 minute version.All else aside, this disc is worth purchasing if you just want what made the charts, but if you want really great and timeless music, purchase all 5 or 6 of The Jacksons' discs and you're in for a musical gift."
2,NOT the complete Brandenburgs!,"I've never listened to this CD, so please forgive me for butting in and giving this product a low rating, but...I just want folks to be aware of something before they take the plunge here. I have no desire to cast aspersions on Susan Lautenburg, the fine violinist featured on this recording. My 2 Star rating has nothing to do with Lautenburg or her group but everything to do with marketing and packaging. These are NOT the complete Brandenburg Concertos, no matter what the previous reviewer thinks. Concertos 2, 3, 4 & 5 are each missing 1 or 2 entire movements.Also, despite what this person says, Glenn Gould never conducted or played on any recorded version of the Brandenburgs, let alone one with poor sound quality."
2,Forcing myself to finish it...,"I struggled through ""First Impressions"" but thought I'd give this one a chance. If I read one more reference to Jeanna's moo-moo, Elaina's knit pants or Ted's ponytail, I am going to scream. The storyline might have been salvaged with good editing but I think the editors did a sloppy job for White Smith. (Who uses the word ""mellifluous"" twice within 30 pages? Ack!) One sentence used the words ""popped"", ""hopped"" and ""be-bopped"" -- yes, all in one sentence. I felt like I was reading Dr. Seuss for a moment.I initially liked the author's idea for these books but there is no way I'm going to dish out cash for the other four books. It's too painful. I could have handled it if was just plain fluffy entertainment but I can't get past the bad writing/editing.I enjoyed White Smith's Seven Sisters series much more."
3,"OK, but dry presentation.","The creatures of the shallow seas DVD has some good (very basic) information, but it is presented in a fairly ""dry"" style. I purchased the DVD ""Wondrous Secrets of the Ocean Realm: City in the Sea & Star Gardens"" at the same time and found it to be much more entertaining and the information presented was fascinating."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered the newly revised Deluxe version of HOP so that I could help my kindergartener learn to read. I'm so disappointed that it doesn't use creative teaching methods. Frankly, it's very, very dry and boring. I expected songs, no songs. I expected interactive CDs, there is one in the entire k-2nd grade kit! Provides nice ""learn to read"" books,a workbook, and a couple of very boring audio CDs. Unfortunately, to access the instructions for each workbook session, one must turn on the audio CD, find the place you last stopped, then listen to the monotone lesson. They are so dull, my daughter tunes right out but there's no other way to get the lesson instructions. The positive side, at least it gives ME a frame of reference to teach my daughter - but such a wasted opportunity for HOPs to teach! There are many inexpensive CD-ROMs on the market that are more effective."
1,no wrench provided..,Now I realize this is stated someplace in the description..but I missed it andfrankly I expect it to be provided. I've busted my pipe trying to replacethe filter..very frustrating. I've looked around and can't find the filter wrenchbut no luck. Yesterday I finally just yanked it and picked up one from the local home improvement store..and that one HAS a wrench. Honestly it's plastic and costs them little so it's ridiculous not to provide one.(I'm not talking about a normal box or open end wrench. It's the circular 'wrench' that's needed to change the filter cartridge. Home improvement stores do NOT carry this)
4,Insight into meaning of life,The author insightfully contemplates the essential meaning of human life from a scientist's point of view while rehearsing the progress of mankind through the historical record by telling the life story of one individual. He points to an inevitable conclusion that is eerily contemporary.
4,It puts the pieces together,"Most textbooks regarding the immune system will treat each part of it as though it were not connected with any other part of the immune system. This book, on the other hand, not only tries to put all the parts together, but does so constantly, in every chapter, so that you are constantly being reminded of all the connections, which makes the workings of the immune system easier to understand, as you are not remembering many little pieces, but a whole continuous network."
2,Darrell's disapointment,Product is long enough with sturdy handle but bristles are soft and shed during use.
5,"If you like Rutter, You'll like this","If you like Rutter, You'll like this, and if you don't know Rutter, this might be a good place to start to investigate his work"
2,Cute but Cheaply Made,"The little ballerina loved decorating her stool, but it lasted about 2 days. Very cheaply made, the screws strip out and it's not very sturdy. Cute, but not a good buy."
2,Widescreen BUT NOT WIDESCREEN ENOUGH!,"I was very disappointed when I finally began watching this DVD, which should have an aspect ration of about 2.3 to 1 and saw it was 1.85 to 1. I saw this film in the theater and know its proper width. Moreover, a picture on the back of the DVD shows a proper width frame. Especially since this is probably the most visually beautiful film ever made, cutting the visual experience just makes zero sense. Hope Criterion or somebody opts to put out the correct version."
2,Pretty and Boring (Pretty Boring),"I'd like to preface my review by saying that I admire the work director Terrence Malick did in ""Badlands"" and for the most part in ""The Thin Red Line"". This film, though, really misses the mark. It seems more concerned with shots of nature and wheat fields than it is with plot or character development. But the wheat fields sure are pretty. I don't want to say that Richard Gere and Brooke Adams as the young couple on the run give bad performances because the film doesn't allow them to stretch themselves. Only Sam Shepard as the doomed farmer gives anything amounting to a multi-layered performance. See this film, if you must, for it's stunning cinematography but don't expect anything special."
1,Poor-very poor,"Wow. For A Criterion movie, I wasn't very impressed. What a poorly done movie. Supposed to be the texas panhandle but big mountains in the background. Showing buffalo and Antelope roaming out of context with the era and location. The normal season change of grasses, crops, tree leaves did not follow the time line of the movie. Just a very poorly done movie. Not worth the investment. I can see why I never heard of this movie. It's a bomb in my opinion."
5,See It For the Stunning Cinematography Alone,"This film tells the tale of a young, impoverished couple(well-played by Richard Gere and Brooke Adams) who arrive as transient workers at the ranch of the lonely, well-to-do Sam Shepard, just before the outbreak of th First World War. The couple is posing as brother and sister, for reasons never made quite clear, and the wife marries the rancher. It is an unhappy tale, but relieved by breathtaking cinematography that will keep you riveted. Not one of the cinematic heavyweights, but intriguing, different, and definitely a visual feast."
1,Not What Your Looking For,Stupid me did not look at the previous review. This is a short book review excerpt only. It is not anything that will help you with suturing and is not from Anne's book. So sorry I wasted $6.00
5,AutoCAD 2000 Bible,"Having purchased AutoCAD for Dummies 2000, and AutoCAD for Architecture 14, this book makes you roll up your sleeves and start working productively from the second chapter. It's written for both the beginner and intermediate AutoCAD user. The CD has various small excercises to complete and provides the user with a wealth of time-saving steps. For anyone using AutoCAD 2000, whether you are a student or professional, this book is excellent. It has saved me literally hours of frustration. The book addresses both architectural and mechanical/electrical diciplines. The plotting chapter is exhaustive, and anyone using AutoCAD knows how important the proper procedures are for final output. Highly recommend this book."
2,Not for Beginners,"I have used this book to teach a basic Cad class. It is helpful for use of reference only, but for a beginner, it can be overwhelming"
3,"Loved the show, not so impressed by the film","Now, I know that you have to have different expectations for a movie than for a TV show, especially one like the Red Green Show. However, I found myself just not that impressed by the film. I think I figured out why... in the movie the writers came up with some external ""enemy"" (the sheriff and the rich guy) that the men of Possum Lodge must defeat. However, what made the show hilarious was that the men of Possum Lodge were inevitably their OWN worst enemy, with predictable consequences. The film had all the characters but not all the elements which really made the show so great."
2,gelato is his life,"I purchased this book because it was mentioned positively on several travel message boards. I found it repetitive (like trying to stretch the material to fill the book) and rather snide, while trying to appear humorous. The remarks about Rick Steves and Frances Mayes were gratuitous and uncalled for."
5,Classically Cool,"Chet Baker wore this. I'm not surprised. It's a combination of lavender and honey that makes you feel as if you're sitting in a European sidewalk cafe reading Le Monde. I don't get much longevity out of this when it's on my skin, but walking through a few mists of this will set me up for a great spring day.The difference between this and any of the Cool Water clones that have been produced since is obvious from one whiff. Everything in here smells REAL."
3,"Good books for curious beginners - in general, but...","I think the Teach Yourself Visually books are useful books for beginners. Many (but not all) of the ""Teach Yourself Visually"" series books are good -- check reviews first on the one you are considering. This one (not a TYV exactly, ""Master Visually XP) is a so-so... I don't like it as well as the TYV Windows XP."
1,THIS IS FAKE!,This product is not legit. It states that Video Games Live is the first Blu-Ray of Video Games Live. This Blu-Ray was never legitimately made. The only Blu-Ray of Video Games Live is has Level 2 on it. Which just now becaming available. Please follow the link to read the actual review and words from Tommy Tollerico.[...]
3,Not Too Shabby,"I bought this guitar for myself to travel with, and I thought the whole 'dry-erase' surface was a cute concept. It's very light-weight (which it should be, with it being designed for kids and all), and it came with a nice little matching black gigbag with the logo brandished in purple. The sound quality is decent (it's a little 'tinny', but better than I anticipated for the type of instrument it is) and it stays in tune for the most part. It's not a bad instrument. It is also fun to draw stuff on it as the mood strikes."
4,Fun Alternative to Traditional Workouts,"I don't use this DVD every day, but it's a fun way to spice up my daily workout from time to time. I really liked the instructor, though I do think that the DVD is a bit advanced for beginners. It can be hard to keep up with her until you learn the routine. Even if you can't do all of the exercises yet, though, it's a great DVD for working up to the instructor's level. It definitely get the heart pumping. I think it's a much better value than some of the other striptease workouts available on Amazon and through other sources. Of course, it is important to remember that this is a WORKOUT video, not a lesson on stripping."
1,A disappointment,"I am a huge fan of most of the Tasty Bite meals. I'd tried almost all of the Indian flavors and had never been let down. I ordered the Green Curry meal without ever having tried it before based on the good reviews here and my past experiance. Unfortuantly, I found it to be nearly inedible. The rice is clumpy and unpleasant and the spicing was just... wrong. I love Thai Green Curry, and this tasted nothing like it. I still recommend the Indian Tasy Bite Meals, but track a box of this down and sample it before you commit to a pack of 6."
2,great WHEN IT WORKS,"I have had this printer for just over a year and I am becoming very frustrated with it's unreliability. (Not sure if that's an official word, but you get the idea). It started out great, but then I had problems with the rollers not picking paper up out of the cartridge. Usually I could get it to take a sheet if I fedd it by hand, but not always, and it is quite tedious if you want to print more than one photo. Also, if the printer thinks it has paper and runs the ""ink"" then you waste a picture's worth and you run out of printer ""ink"" before you run out of paper.I THINK you can fix this problem by putting a stack of index cards under you photo paper when the cartridge gets less than 3/4 full, but since I ran out of ink and haven't replaced it yet (winkflash is much less frustrating!)I have not tested this theory.I hope Kodak is able to correct this in it's next generation of printers."
3,Not all it says it is,"Judging from previous reviews of this movie and being interested in parrots I decided to buy it. It is a nice, cute story. The quality of the picture and filming is poor. I expected better picture. It is worth the watch, but not the purchase."
3,"Interesting & touching, may not be for children","This was so interesting, loved learning about the parrots and their personalities, their individual stories. Read no further if you don't want me to spoil the ending for you, but the ending may not be for sensitive children - Mark stops feeding the parrots (not really sure why his moving across the bay makes this necessary, he doesn't have a job after all), and the beautiful and sweet parrot he had named ""Connor"" that we came to know and love in the story, is found to be uncharacteristically on his own without the flock, and the film ends abruptly with a photograph of this sweet creature being eaten by a hawk."
5,"ah, the beauty of true love...",A lovely movie about a loving man and his lovable flock of friends. It made me laugh and cry and feel good about being alive. What more can you desire? Wonderful.
3,Snowden 8th Grade,"We are 13 year old kids who normally watch anything other than this, but we give it 3 stars. We liked the end when Mark got a girlfriend. We didn't like it when Connor died. Overall, a little boring but better than doing classwork."
3,"If you're a bird lover, you'll probably like it","This isn't an actual artistic movie, more like a documentary, which might make it a little bit boring sometimes - but thinking about it as a story about us, not just the birds, makes it a lot more interesting. A real-life story with real experiences, it kind of put life itself into perspective."
5,A very special film for anyone who loves animals.,"I first heard about this film on Ebert and Roeper. I am a resident of the San Francisco bay area, but I had never heard about these parrots. What a story! Mark, the flock's ""guardian,"" has such a close relationship with these parrots and he is able to show us just how smart they are, and how each one of them is a special individual. In writing this review, it is difficult for me to articulate how the film affected me. I loved it. It doesn't matter whether you have an interest in birds or not. It is my opinion that most people will fall in love with these parrots and their stories. Some surprises at the end, too. Check out the special features on the DVD to see various updates on the flock, Mark's trip back to see Mingus, and an interesting follow-up segment from some neighborhood residents who comment about the flock and about seeing Connor."
2,kick thy own self....again,"this is not the old brother dave,.....he is obciously older and the recycled jokes lose a lot of their sparkle. obciouly a Labor of Love when filming, and impossible to use to encourage new fans to a[[recoate the Old Days of Dave...."
2,Brother Dave Gardner,"My oh my, how long has it been since my wife and I enjoyed his performances in the 1950's. Great performance and brought back many good and bad memories. Quality was not as good as one might wish for but enjoying it still."
1,Quality is very poor,"When it works - it works. When it doesn't...I've had 4 of them over the past 6 or 8 years. The first one developed a crack in the housing and I returned it to Lowes for a replacement. The second one developed a crack so severe that it flooded the basement. Omni replaced that one at no charge. The third one is now dripping from a seam in the plastic and the customer service rep. from Omni refuses to replace saying ""she'd never had similar complaints."" What the other reviews tell you is true as well - it works well (until the leak) and it does take considerable effort to find just the right torque on the lower canister to prevent dripping. Why the 4th? No time for plumbing - just replacing. I will be shopping for a new filter from a different manufacturer this summer. After that - NO MORE OMNI !!!"
1,Hugh Disappointment,"Before installing the product I attempted to operate the valve on top with the wrench supplied. The effort to turn it was so high that the wrench (plastic) kept slipping off. I finally succeeded in freeing it and went on to to try and remove the filter housing. I was never able to loosen it up and gave up, fearing I would break the plastic wench that came with the setup. I called Omni Corp to see if I had a defective unit or if they were all like that. I was told that the unit had been out of production for a while and they gave me the model number of the newer version. I am not sure if the problem with the unit I had was age, and the lubricant installed at the factory had dried up, or a very poor design. I think it was a combination of booth! I returned it to Amazon a purchased the new model locally."
3,clean water,The only thing that I do not like about this product is that there is no by pass like the previous omni that I had. The valve can only open or shut the water flow but no by pass
4,easy to purchase,I like the softballs and our team enjoys the sport. They seem to be good quality. They are easy to throw.
1,NOTE TO CUSTOMERS:,"Some of these guys are reviewing the wrong cd. There are 3 versions of the We're in This Together single. Make sure you get the one you want! Or get them all like I did. I'm not particulaly fond of this one, though."
1,Very Disappointed,"The only song I enjoyed was ""Tell It Like It is"". I did enjoy seeing Ed Bradley on stage. I still miss not seeing him on 60 Minutes."
2,Book is no good,"This book came after 14 days which is on time according to the window. However the CD is broken in half, I could not used the CD, so the book is useless. Fritz."
1,A very weak History Book,"As one who knows little about the period the author covers I was immediately impressed with how obvious the deficiencies of the novel were. This is, at best, a junior level treatise of the ""French and Indian war."" The Iroquois and other native American groups are referred to only to illuminate the character of the French and English generals, description of the actual battles leave one with no impression whatsoever as to how they were fought or won, and long diversions into anecdotes about the founding father's actions serve to distract the reader from the events they are actually supposed to be taking part in. Finally it is obvious that the writer has done little or no original research to justify his having attempted to write a book aimed at adults, much less students of history. A very disappointing read."
1,Ridiculous Plot,The acting is fine but the story has more obvious holes in it than you can shake a stick at.
3,R. Gere,I'm a fan of Richard Gere and enjoyed the twist at the end of this movie. Was really surprised at the performance of a young Edward Norton. Seems to drag in the middle but watch out for the ending.
4,Awesome ! Gere at his best. Full of surprises.,"A little on the gory side, but really a great action flick. The ending is unexpected and leaves a little bit hanging, possible sequel material. Gere does an excellent job playing a high-priced defense attorney."
3,Nortons performance is all,"The film is just average,full of cliche's Richard Gere gives a horrible almost completely rediculous performance. The film is saved by a great performance by Edward Norton. He has the potential to be as good if not better than God AKA Robert DeNiro (Mully)"
4,Fragrance doesn't last as long as I would have expected,"First let me tell you I have never before purchased an essential oil, so it may be deserving of 5 stars. I didnt realize the scent would evaporate as quickly as it did for me. Still enjoyed the product."
4,Great anime but to short,"I watched this series and I loved it but i think it should of been longer. The story was moving so fast and by the time i got to figure what the whole story is about it just ends. The part that really moved fast was the ending and yet in the beginning of episode 2 there is about 15 minutes of footage they could of left out or make it into 3 episodes instead of just 2 episodes on this disc. Overall, its a great anime with awesome dubbed voice acting but if they made the series into like 3 or 4 episodes it will be more worth it. There is some nudity when the girls transform into bustier girls. This is not Ken Akamatsu's greatest work in anime but its worth giving a shot. The storyline is excellent. I wouldnt recommend this anime to just any anime fan but i believe people would enjoy this because of the background story behind it and have girls transform into Santa's helpers *note they are not elves*."
2,"OK, but older than old","I knew this was a black and white flick, but because it is such an old movie, the quality of the film is terrible. It is very dark and hard to see the night scenes. The ordering process was great, no problem with that at all."
1,Don't like the texture,"The texture and ""feel"" of these sheets does not feel like a 600 thread count fabric. Even after several washings, they feel coarse and rough. I am very disappointed with this set."
5,Good book on heavy ion physics,"There are not many books on relativistic heavy ion collisions and this is a very good one among them. It covers a lot of stuff with details, although not very deeply. You can learn the basic concepts in heavy ion physics from this book. A lot of thoroughly worked examples will help you understand. The context is easy to understand. But it's somehow outdated because new experiments and theories haver emerged since its published year (1994). Many new signatures for QGP should be covered if there would be a new edition."
2,Fair at best!,These bulbs do not last very long. While they are a good price in the end you spend the same amount as other longer lasting brands.
3,"A slow start, but the blood doeth flow...","I think this book could have used a little more help from the editors, or perhaps the author. But in Abbey's defense, time was running a little short. This is classic Abbey, and the story does get rolling after a while. It got my blood flowing, and there's no lack of action. I'll say that. Abbey's ever-present push for anarchy is in full bloom, and it sometimes gets a little wearing. (The man seems to have a one-track mind.) His characterizations verge on comic-book, and holy cats and bananas, can this guy hyperbolate! Nevertheless, money well spent, and a good read."
2,Not impressed with the visual aspect,The content seems to be OK. But for a software book that is touted to be a visual presentation I was very disappointed with the lack of color in the book. The most color I saw was on the front cover. Very dull. If I had a choice to do it over I would pick a different publication and author.
3,A good book about the coming of the end,"""Shiva Descending"" by Grergory Benford & William Rosler is the classic story of an asteriod hitting the earth. On one side, you have NASA with the help space agencies from around the world trying to stop Shiva. On the other side, the effect of the coming doom have sent the avarage person over the edge.This book was pretty good, but the book was dated and it seem slow in places. Another problem I had that the reader didn't really have a time frame for the book and at time that really bug me. A fan of the ""End of the world"" genre will enjoy it."
4,Works as advertised,"This router was relatively easy to setup once I figured out that the (MC) antivirus software on the system was getting in the way, and I turned off the antivirus software. It would have been useful if the setup software warned about the problem; I needed to guess that the antivirus software was an issue without any warnings from either piece of software."
1,Plenty of Problems,"I've really liked Linksys products before, but I don't think I will ever buy them again. Tech support for existing firmware with known bugs is non-existent. Time filtering of packets requires that the router be able to acquire the correct time. The current version of the firmware can't. The documentation for the filtering is poor, and doesn't explain how the rules are applied."
4,Peace of Mind,"Living on a miltary base there are several wireless networks available. Not everyone is cautious enough to protect their networks. Having a physical firewall with a wireless router provides the added protection to keep ""harvesters"" off of our network. The downside was setting up the firewall through the wireless router. After several trials and errors we got our network connected securely. The setup instructions were useful to a point. A strong backround in computers was a necessity to successfully install in our case."
1,Product with known problems,"I purchased this product March 2005 after the failure of our previous router, Linksys BEFS41. I was attracted by the firewall feature. The newly purchased BEFSX41 did not work for me, even after 2 hours on the phone with customer service. Finally they admitted that this model had some known problems, and offered to send me a software upgrade. I received an empty email from them, no attachement, but enough disclaiming words to convince me to return the router IMMEDIATELY. The software they would finally send me 2 days later was a Beta version with the disclaimer that they would not guarantee that it would solve any problems, and they would not be responsible for any damage to my hardware. I would stay away from this model for now."
4,reliable long use-easy,"I have had this router for my 3 computers for, at least, 4 years or more. Can't remember just when I bought it, could be longer. It was an easy set up for me even when we moved into a new home with smart home wiring. When friends bring their laptops they hook into the Linksys with an Ethernet cable and hop right on line-no problems. It works well but now that we have high speed internet I'm having some speed problems and think it may be the router. I bought a new Motorola high speed modem to hook to my comcast cable and it is even slower then the basic RCA that I rented from comcast previously....so, I don't know. However, the Linksys router worked fine with the new connection as far as connecting the computers. My problem may be my computer. I have not one bad thing to say about the router--it works fine but I need to investigate how it interfaces with modem speeds, I guess."
3,Does the problem lie in what internet service provider you use??,"Haven't yet purchased this item, but it was recommended to me. By reading the reviews, I seem to have noticed a trend. Does anyone else realize that almost everyone who had problems using this router states they had DSL, and those who gave it good reviews tend to have cable internet? I didn't realize there was a difference between the two, but could that be the problem?"
1,BEFSX41 is a dog,"The Linksys BEFSX41 is a real dog. My first one rebooted whenever I uploaded jpeg files with the firewall enabled. With the firewall off, it uploaded fine. Tech support said that it seemed to be a hardware problem so they sent me a new one.The new one is even worse. It reboots at random. Tech support said I should flash the new firmware (version 1.50.18). Don't do that if you want the router to work at all. We had to force a reflash of the older version to get it to be able to boot up again. Now it still reboots at random times, and sometimes I have to force the reboot. It seems to want to stay in its diagnostic state with the evil red light on for a long time.Tech support now wants me to get another new one. What makes them think that it will be any better?"
5,Very realistic!,I am from a farming family so I know how this toy should look and perform in order to accurately portray a larger version. It is very realistic and its parts look like a real tractor with disc. My Great Nephew plays with it constantly. It is well made and very durable. I think that it will be a toy that he hands down to a child of his own. I will buy more of this product line to add to his collection!
3,Different From P90X,"After completing the program in its entirety, I've downgraded my overall score to a ""3."" I'm glad it's different from regular X (and it's VERY different), but I really got sick of the program by the end and I don't feel it had much of an impact on my fitness.Bottom line: I think it's worth doing, but don't expect big things from it."
2,Very Disappointed,"I am a huge fan of the original P90X. I did it for two years straight and pitched it to everyone I knew (and at the same time got in the best shape of my life). I could not wait for the sequel. When it finally arrived I was like a little kid on X-mas morning. But man oh man, I could not have been more disappointed. It's almost like the first one was so great, that they had to get gimmicky. Way too much core and balance. Not enough strength training. Who really cares if you can balance on medicine balls? The whole thing was a total bummer. I returned mine and got my money back. On a positive note, the original is still great - I'd go with that instead."
3,Lawyers and marketing people have diluted the program,"As a long-time P90X fan, I looked forward to P90X2. Thus, it was all the more disappointing to be subjected to the legal disclaimers on every DVD that cannot be skipped or fast forwarded. The P90X2 lawyers are all over this one, and you will be reminded of it everytime you play a DVD, everyday, every DVD.And, the workout sheets have advertising that causes the actual work-out log to be so small as to be difficult to read and write.The workouts themselves are great. But you have to suffer through a lot of aggravation to actually use the product. Tony let the lawyers and marketing people overwhelm the otherwise great aspects of P90X2. On balance, P90X2 is a downgrade from P90X."
1,"Bland, poorly performed French ""classics""","I purchased several CDs to use as ambient music for a French play. This was, by far, the biggest disappointment. Non-descript performances, dull arrangements, this is like Parisien elevator music. There are the obligatory accordian instrumentals, some of which are poorly performed. The vocals, all uncredited, try to approximate the feel of the originals, but come up short every time. No Edith Piaf here! If you're looking for excellent performances and good recordings, I recommend ""Cafe De Paris"" and ""Stars of French Music from the 30s and 40s"", both double CD sets with songs performed by talents like Chevalier, Piaf, Yves Montand, and Josephine Baker. There, you're getting the real thing, and not badly arranged, badly executed Musak."
1,Sun Reflector Standard Sunshade,This is the worst! It is so lightweight & flimsy that it takes forever to try & stand up on the dash. Even trying to secure it with sun visors in car - it still falls. It is suppose to fit a sedan - my car is 4 door lexus sedan. Would never recommend to this brand to anyone!
5,big,"Huge screen just as it said. Works great and reflecting sunlight. I use this thing for my apartment window. My window is facing west and the sun really pounds through my window, this screen makes a noticible difference in how hot the room gets."
5,You Feel Magic,"Agata has a powerful voice, combining the power of Celine Dion and Mariah Carey. Her songs range from fast and upbeat with tremendous vocal power, to slow and heart wrenching enough to bring tears. When you listen to Agata voice, you feel magic. She is ready to shine!"
1,Tacky,"This is Mexican favorites from a corny old folks perspective. It was neither classical or tejano, just tacky stuff. I was very disappointed and returned it."
3,An enjoyable indulgence,"I found this book to a fun read because I have seen all of the episodes it discusses. If one has not seen all of the episodes used to make philosophical points I would imagine the reader would feel like an outsider listening in on a conversation of which they are not a part, relying heavily on the summaries and references to the show provided. However, one must experience the shows first to get the most out of this book. As for the stars, I use a pre-Vietnam war grading system as the book is a solid average and its grace stems from its own unique circumstances. Warning--one's own pride may prevent getting the most out of this book."
5,"Sweet,Deadly, and Loud",This cd is one of the best I have ever heard. Cradle of Filth are one of the best bands in the metal scene today. I loved the way they went from instrumental sounds then changed to the crashing sounds of guitar and a screaming lead singer and back again. They are one of the few metal bands I have found who can pull off both the music and the dramatic theatrics. If you are into dark metal music this is the band to check out!
2,Cradle Have Lost Their Touch.........,"I Bought This Album When It First Was Released, And I Have Been Listening To It Since.....Not Out Of Admiration, Or Even Amusement....I've Been Trying To Figure Out What The Hell Happened To The Cradle I Used To Love Listening To For Hours On End. This Atrocity Is A Most Horrible Step Down From The Utterly Amazing Midian. The Only Songs On This CD That Even Caught My Attention Were ""Suicide And Other Comforts"" And ""All Hope In Eclipse"".....The Rest Are Utter Worthless Nonsense. If The CoF Boys Can't Do Better Than This From Now On, They've Lost A Fan That Has (And Would Have Continued To)Buy All Of Their Released Merchandise And Music. Dani Needs To Get His Ideas Straight....This Band Isn't All His, But This CD Shows That He Appearantly Thinks It Is.........My Verdict Is, Pass This One Up For Any Other CoF Realease."
3,Good... but not essential.,"Cradle's third EP is comprised of 2 short instrumentals, 1 cover, 3 updated versions of tracks from their first album and 4 original tracks. The instrumentals are decent, but nothing special as is the cover. The updated versions neither meet nor surpass the originals (with the possible exception of Summer Dying Fast which sounds great). It is the 4 original tracks that should be of greatest interest to anyone looking into this release. All are good but two stand out especially, ""All Hope in Eclipse"" and ""Suicide and Other Comforts"". While they do not rank amongst Cradle's best songs, they are very entertaining. Overall this is a good release but recommended only for serious fans of the band. Newcomers are urged to pick up ""V Empire... or Dark Faerytales in Phallustein"", ""Dusk... and Her Embrace"" and ""Cruelty and the Beast""."
5,Very entertaining!,Easy to understand and read. It was like I was there but in the same way glad I wasn't because of the descriptions that seemed to jump out!
4,One officer's first hand account of horror and survival in some of the gruesome WWII battles in Europe,"Wilson's is a first person account of a platoon leader's baptism under fire and his development as an effective leader under frightful combat situations. Time after time he is the leader of the platoon leading the attack against semingly impregnable enemy defenses. His platoon experiences horrendous shelling by enemy artillery on several occasions and even accidental shelling and bombing by American forces. On one occasion, Wilson is the only officer in his company to survive unbelievably violent shelling while engaged in attacking entrenched enemy forces. At the end of all this heroic action, Wilson never gets the promotion his battallion commander promised him if he survived his first day of combat."
3,Quick read,"A good basic account of an infantry leader in Europe during 1944. Details are interesting, although there is virtually no overall framework or background to Wilson's story. What is striking, however, is how heavy the casualties were and how Wilson was forced to work with green officers and men over and over as he was called upon to execute repeated missions. Worth the read, and its quick."
1,Not real BB products.,"I knew before opening the bag that this product was not real. I am a hairstylist how works with Bumble and Bumble all day long. My salon was out of gentle, this bottle was for me so I ordered amazon which I love. Sad when sellers do this. Thank God for reviews."
5,"moisturizing, transforming","I bought this shampoo and the matching super rich conditioner at a local salon. I was very skeptical at first but i thought i would give it a try. I was desperate for something to salvage my hair. I had the typical glossy healthy asian hair but after many self inflicted tortures (dyed, highlighted, permed), it was brittle and dry like a wig. I can honestly say before I used this product I did not believe in any miracle shampoos or beauty products. After just the first wash, I could feel my hair softened and became more like my old hair. The difference is kind of like adding clothing softener to your laundry. I've been using it for two weeks now and hopefully it'll continue to be this good. I'd recommend it to anyone!!"
5,B and B Gentle Shampoo,Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo - it is the best shampoo available. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a shampoo that is gentle on the hair.
1,Rip off !!!!!!!!!!,"When I placed this order I specifically ordered a shield for a 2007 Hyundai. I was sent one for an '06 which would not fit. I sent it back and received another one for a '02-06'. I have been assessed $45.47 in return charges for something that was NOT my fault! I guess I'll find another site to order from.I'd like to give it zero stars, but it wouldn't let me!"
3,"Go Dischord, not Amazon!","Well, I found it disappointing after 'No Kill No Beep Beep' but you know, diff'rent strokes for diff'rent folks. It doesn't seem as honest, lively, and energetic. In some ways it just feels a bit contrived - go 80s."
2,Pictured Pyramid Looks Hand Painted...,"& natural with the sandy color & distinctive reliefs. But I received a SOLID gold colored pyramid (with the black & white eye & some company's illegible logo slapped on), that looks cheap by comparison.The lid is hollow, following the pyramid shape, the storage is square. I'd give it 3 stars, it's ok, but that picture is as much as false advertising. edit: later figured out this was out of stock and they had sent an entirely different product. boo hiss."
2,"Scatter-brained references every page, little original thought","Not too impressed after waiting eagerly to read this cobbled together book. The first half offers some genuine analysis and original observations. Towards the latter half he turns to instead dissecting more renowned authors of yore, with little effort made to relate them to present conditions."
4,Disturbing but Bracing,"This is a strong and realistic book. True, you will not find a detailed, balanced sociololgical treatise. But we shouldn't expect that kind of report from a journalist. What we do get in this book is the assurance of first-hand exposure to some of the planet's most serious areas of concern. Like Paul Kennedy's ""Preparing for the 21sy Century,"" Kaplan's book blows away the myths of globalization optimism, painting a world that is coming square into contact with some hard ecological and demographic realities."
5,"On par with ""Balkan Ghosts""","Kaplan's journalistic skills are matchless in this penetrating anlaysis. Too often, writers fail to persuade bcause they fail to live in their work. ""Coming Anarchy"" comes to life with a ""been there, done that"" immediacy that cannot be faked. Another New England author who has captured the essence of the coming anarchy amidst an apparent utopia in the West, is Jerry Furland, author of the powerful and gripping novel ""Transfer-the end of the beginning"".No one who reads either of these authors will come away unchanged by the experience."
2,no good,"I like motorola products however this phone is no good. the ear piece that came with it did not work, and when I answer the phone it takes about 2 seconds for it to connect clearly. Seems like an eternity. When it does clear up I can hear clearly, but the person on the other end, hears a ""swishing"" noise. Driving me crazy just like my panasonic that I replaced! Tried changing channels, no luck. Have to take it back. are there any good cordless phones?"
2,Didn't interest me,"I've always been a believer that you can usually tell if a show is going to be good by watching the first few episodes. You get to meet the characters and see if they interest you, pick up on the plot elements, and get involved with the story.I like anime, but I could not get into this show. It just didn't grab me enough to hold my interest and want to continue watching the show. Not that it was a few hours of my life I wish I could get back, it wasn't that bad, it just wasn't that good.But if you like anime, I'd suggest at least giving it a shot. There were others who seemed to like it... I just didn't happen to be one of them."
5,Betty White at the start,These were the shows where I frist saw Betty White and they are as good now as then. Fine quality picture and sound for early TV programs.
4,Looks great. Performance is okay,"Realistic looking train. There was trouble with the couplers on the unpowered engine. I had to manually reverse them with a very small screw driver but then it was okay. The train derails if it runs over one-quarter speed because the cars are so long that they make contact with each other when turning. Over all, it's a good looking train and with the right set-up, it's very enjoyable."
4,"Solid train, looks and functions as promised","I needed a decent quality N gauge train for a small setup. This one delivered. Great look and feel to it. Needs to be worn in a bit, as I experienced a high number of derailments at first. It functions better when the locos are on either end instead of double stacked (I think it helps even out the balance). When arranged in that way, it runs very smooth. Great little set!"
2,Unfortunately - a big question mark,"Well, I'm familiar with Surya Das teachings in person, and they are always excellent.His previous books are OK. but this one is definitely not a masterpice among hundreds and hundreds of profound Dharma writers."
1,not much of use,"If you want to learn about a few classes in .Net only you can buy this book for fun. Actually in MSDN you can almost get all the information and this is a entry level book. If you read any .net programming book for about 1 week you get all the information written in length in this book already.Look at the page 119 function ConvChar, he even copied everything from MSDN decoder class, even the comments! That is outrageous!"
4,"Works great, easy to swallow.",Sometimes you don't feel like you have gotten as much C in you as you thought and wonder if the product is below par. That has not been the case with this product. I have used several bottles of this and found the quality to be as hoped for. I also like supporting a company that provides vegan options. I have been pleased with all of the products I have used from Veglife.
2,Disappointing,"My little one loves kitties and he love to find things in illustrations, so I thought this would be the perfect combination. I was wrong. The illustrations were unimaginative and very small, making it difficult to actually find the kitten on some pages. And the text was really no fun to read. Add to that some very strained rhymes and it's a book we've rarely taken off the shelf and my son never reaches for on his own."
4,Cool,"I think this is a very fun game. It used to be my favorite in the series. Now realMyst is my favorite, so I will rate this game a four star. I like the puzzles you have to solve. It's realy interesting."
1,Fatal Errors,"I am a fan of Myst and Riven, and was excited when Exile came out. Unfortunately, that was short lived right after installation. Unlike Myst or Riven, for which I had no problems, Exile did nothing but crash my computer. The only way I could get my computer back to normal was to uninstall Exile. I wanted to play the game, not spend hours on a phone or chase emails for possible solutions with Tech support. My computer is a Sony Vaio, pentium III, 500mhz, with plenty of speed that has no problem running all my other software. I decided to skip the frustration and return Exile. I owned it for all of two hours."
1,More problems than anything I have ever incountered before.,I have a computer system that isnt even 2 months old yet. I have a PIII and 128 megs of RAM...I put in an Elsa Gladiac Ultra video card that had 64 megs of ram on it...This computer is beefy and can handle most anything...I bought this game and from the very start had problems with it...Installation was a NIGHTMARE!! After finally thinking I had it installed I atteped to play the game...All was well for about 5 minutes..I made it through the opening movie and two clicks of the mouse when the game just decided it didnt want to play anymore. I then uninstalled it. I was relly looking forward to this realese since Im a huge fan of the Myst series...I believe they tried to go to gold code a little to quickly to get the product out the door....I could of waited for a better product.
1,Watch out for system requirements,I am a huge fan of the Myst series and have been waiting for this game for a long time. Unfortunately it is not supported by my Intel video card and does not work. Though my system meets the requirements on the box it still does not work. So buyer beware this game was promoted and released by Ubi-Soft. They rushed the product to market and they know it. I was told by their technical support that they will have a patch out within the month. No definite time was given. So if you purchase this game get ready to wait a month to play it. Isn't capitalism grand?
1,Disappointed as a Myst Fan,"I have a Sony Vaio, 866 mhz, 8 months old, and I too cannot play the game! It is extremely disappointing, because now my computer is in the shop because, as the company said, my computer is corrupted from the game. I don't know if I will be able to eventually play the game, as I need to reinstall Windows on my computer--maybe then it will work. Also, other games that worked fine before Exile was installed now give me error messages and crash. Hopefully this patch they are working on will be helpful to us disappointed Myst fans..."
5,"Difficult puzzles, stunning scenery, good story line","Myst Exile, is a lot of fun to play. Pay close attention to your surroundings, write down key details, things that others say to you. This game can be difficult to decipher at times, but be patient. You might miss something if you try to go through too quickly. The scenes are gorgeously detailed graphics. Wonderful soundtrack music. Hours of challenging gameplay. I recommend this game highly."
2,Needs Macintosh Patch,"I had no trouble navigating Myst and Riven. This game seems very unstable on my Macintosh. Perhaps a patch for Macintosh, which has been promised since May 2001 will make a fan of me."
2,Buyer Beware,"I so enjoyed the unusual story line, stunning graphics, and non-linear style of Myst and Riven. I ran both on my old, slow computer with minor problems.I anxiously installed Exile on my new Dell and immediately realized that something was wrong. I had fallen into a trap that I'm sure a few others have experienced. Read all small print BEFORE purchasing the product.Exile only runs on Windows 95/98/ME. My new Dell is an XT which UbiSoft won't support. Imagine sitting through a 3D movie with no special glasses. This distracting aspect ruined the rest of the game's good qualities. My disappointment equals a negative 5 stars."
2,Would have enjoyed it better without the 360 degree spin,"Firstly, I love Riven - absolutely adore the game! I've also played Myst 01 and the Journeyman series. However, Myst 03: Exile didn't quite fit up to the rest for me. Why? It makes me dizzy. Honestly, I could play the game, but I couldn't play for longer than 10 minutes at a time until I worked out how to slow the revolving screen view by right-clicking the mouse - and even then it only allowed me to struggle my way through the game's labyrinth at about 3/4 an hour a time. I play Riven and Journeyman not for the adventure, but the visuals and it's hard to enjoy the scenery when you're suffering from a 'Quake' sized headache. I wish that the producers had done the 360 view like Journeyman 03 and not as they had chosen to do. I won't buy 'Uru'. The threat of being mentally incapacitated for a few hours subsequent to playing is too great and I'm not going to risk it.Pity. It's a good game otherwise."
3,its nice not great but nice,"i like myst and myst 3 this Atrus guy writes up worlds baisicly every thing in it and he can write any thing he needs so in myt 3 he's writing a new age but he suspects someones been linking into his study now hes all obsessed with locking evrey thing up so this dude has to buy locks think about it any way thats not my point it starts with a nice visit atrus says he wants to introduce you to the d'ni all of a sudden this weird lookin phsyco dude links in the study you know the drill this wheeeeeew sound and this freaky guy comes in and breaks the bubble thingy and grabs the book, sets the place on fire ,disappears and im thinkin ""not again"" so you have to follow him im still tryng to figure out the game but what can i say im nine im just learning my times table and this game wants you to be a genius how am i supposed to figure out how to open up a door by using only light ....personally i dont like this manual i mean it leaves you clueless ...."
4,pretty easy. pretty and easy,"over in 4 days on my own, no hints. now to wait another 4 years for the next one. atrus once again is really indebted to me. maybe he will pay back in the next game. the pictures in exile are stunning, but beautiful graphics do not a good game make. the only stumper i found was in the voltaic age in the room with the rivenese numbers. it was hard only because it was late at night; solved it first thing in the am. seriously, though, i enjoyed every minute, but myst and riven are more satisfying games, giving a greater sense of accomplishment. hence, only 4 stars for exile. for a game thats harder, but with less spectacular scenery, try riddle of the sphinx. cheap too."
4,Work great!,"These load easy, fit snug, haven't torn on me yet, and the ears at the top make them easy to tie up and carry to the trash can. Best I've tried yet, and I've tried a lot."
4,compactor bags,these bags work great very strong and economical compared to other bags it would be nice if the holes were punched in them
3,"Okay, but there's a much better choice","I bought this book about a year ago, and I'm sure it's okay. However, I recently bought ""Silman's Complete Endgame Course,"" which has been much more helpful. ""Just the Facts"" breaks endgames down by position type (for example Rook Endgames). Silman's breaks endgames down by the player's ability. So there is a chapter for beginners, then ""E"" players, then ""D"" players, etc. For me (a ""D"" player) the Silman approach was much more rewarding. ""Just the Facts"" is probably great for better players, but if you're learning, I highly recommend Silman's."
3,so so,"Just the facts...I'm not sure what it is about this book. Maybe it's just plain boring. The material is thoughtful. The diagrams are good.I will keep this book and read it over again but it didn't get the job done for example like ""Silman's Complete Endgame Course"". This book will help you improve your endgame but it feels kind of like school."
1,"Excellent watch, but...","Isn't the same model that the picture, I received a watchband with a color diferent (blue light) and I want a similar that the picture."
2,Product partly satisfactory,"This tape reflected light very well at nighttime, however it did not have a fluorescent characteristic that would be important during the daytime and which is important to me and I hoped that it would. I continue to look for a tape which incorporates both characteristics."
1,Think twice before purchasing!!!,"I received the plates broken. Although I had read this in previous reviews, I thought SURELY that they would revisit their method of packing after continually receiving them back!!! They have obviously chosen to ignore this problem, however!"
1,Too awkward,"Too Heavy. Too ""shakey""...vibrates a lot. Gets too hot. Not so ergonomic. Bad tool. Milwaukee sawzall is much better."
1,Watch out,"This is the second Danby I have owned, and the second I will be returning for the same reason.....it leaks water. Danby referred me to several repair people in my area bu all were either out of business or said they don't work on Danby. It's a great dehumidifier when it works, but it doesn't last. Will avoid from now on."
3,Interesting but really have to go to the class it is used.,"I had to get this book for my anthro class. Honestly, I found it mildly interesting but it really must be used as context for the class. Seriously I mean it."
3,Helpful,"I had an Anthropology assignment, and chose this book. It came on time, good condition, and very informative. Never bought a book online, but now I know where to go when in need."
1,portable tv,"This portable color tv doesn't give me any channel that you can actually watch. I returned it and I was credited. However, much to my surprise I received the same five inch tv as I had returned. It already cost me to have it returned. Since I didn't ask for it, should I consider it a gift?"
1,beware of size,the size is smaller than actual. I bought two other 9 months bumpkins and when compared side to side it was twice larger. Beware this looks like a slim fit!!
2,Disappointed,"Just to keep it short, graphics sux compared to allied assault, the ammo is scarce the germans are plenty. Just way too hard for easy or medium. Spearhead was short and the game play is way better. It's just best to say ""SAVE YOU MONEY"" for something else."
2,Poor illustrations mar this book,"These series of booklets are primers to niche areas in history. Thus, the text is basic and acts as a supporting cast to the illustrations. The illustrations are dreary, with an overt painterly look. Low on details which is a pity as these series of books are also targetted at reenactors and figure modellers."
3,Beautiful fragrance,I love the fragrance but I think the way you spray the perfume needs to be redesigned. It does not really spray even a mist out. If I bought it again it would have to have a normal spray applicator.
4,A quality part,We chose the 7F over the model 7 because it had a full comb of teeth. This results in a smoother cut and requires fewer passes to finish a job. One has to be careful though because a slip is hard to trim out and cover. Oster products are always the shear of choice. The cryogen X blade lasts longer than previous models.
3,It didn't cut as well as expected,"I have a Himalyan cat and previously used a #10 clipper to shave her, which worked well until the blade got dull. A groomer highly recommended that I order the #7F, but it didn't work as well as I expected. I will use this in the winter since it keeps her fur a little longer, but I will need to replace my #10 for the hotter months."
4,Good blade,No negative feedback.I also have a #5 blade that I find more convenient when shaving my Golden-doodle (particularly with matted hair)
1,Not in stock,This item is advertised as being in stock...IT IS NOT. I ordered based on this information and was contacted by the seller and informed that it was backordered...that's fine...happens all the time....but change the availability to 'not in stock' so others don't order based on this false availability.
3,Funny,"The main characters of this fantasy are very stereotypical, but they're really entertaining. One in particular kept me giggling throughout most of the work. Sometimes the author fails to describe the action scenes as detailed as I would like (ex. When did this guy end up in a tree? I don't understand what's happening.) It was a little bit like playing an old-school video game. Your main characters have a set of attacks they can do, and the battles are very predictable and standard (first one guy goes in, then the next guy attacks, then the third guy attacks, and the underdog hero sweeps in at the last minute to save them all). The group goes from one battle to the next to the next to the next, with lulls of riding a ship or walking through a forest in between the battles. Overall it was entertaining enough, but very very simple and stereotypical."
3,Low budget suspense movie,"I knew this was a low budget suspense movie so my expectations were not high. I really ordered it cuz I wanted to see what kind of actress Lenka Kripac is since I love her music and I thought it would be interesting to see how the Australians do a horror flick.....I love old cheesy horror flicks..this one was ok..some of it was a little confusing but it kept me entertained. Again, if you are expecting some great horror flick, this is not the movie for you, but it held my interest well enough."
5,All the Best From Ireland,"You can feel the spirit of Ireland in this music!! I listen daily. I only wish it listed artists names instead of ""various artists""."
5,"Easy to attach, easy to use.","This was another gift from my Wishlist. I picked it after reading reviews and wasn't disappointed.I use it on my 9 lb poodle in my sink.It attached VERY easily to my kitchen sink, and I'm a moron when it comes to ANYTHING remotely related to minor household repairs and fixes. It went on with no issues, was tight and didn't leak.The spray is powerful enough to rinse clean my poodle's tight, curly hair. The best thing about it is the swivel nozzle with turns very easily to get my dog's belly with one hand, which is important because I have to hold her in the sink so she doesn't jump out. There's plenty of hose, so if you use it in a larger sink and on a larger dog, you should have no problem. This is a lifesaver, because it will save me a TON of cash in the long run on baths and grooming."
3,Kind'a flimsy,"The product was shipped right away from the supplier and I was happy about that. However, I was hoping that this pet shower was just a little better built. The fittings that attach to the faucet are fine as well as the hose, but the shower head itself is really not much to rave about. I like the idea of a lever or grip to control the water (something I particularly searched for), but there isn't much of a spray, just water running through a bunch of holes. Makes a dog with a thick coat of fur difficult to rinse. I've seen better heads after searching some more, albeit quite a bit more expensive. Also, if it attached to the faucet as shown, why do you need 5-6 feet of hose. It only gets in the way. Considering that a shower that attaches to a faucet and has a grip or lever to control the flow of water is hard to find, this will have to do for awhile."
4,good dog bathing product,"Before getting this product, I needed to move my 20 pound dog around in the laundry basin to get her under the faucet. This stressed her out and made bathing her difficult. It was so much easier giving her a bath using this product and caused much less stress. There's also a small wire latch on the shower head that locks the thumb operated on/off button in the on position. The hose easily attaches to the laundry basin faucet and comes off just as easily."
4,works greaty,"I like this shower. There's no leaks and I can leave the faucets on when I'm not using the sprayer. Only thing is the smell of the new hose is almost too much, almost skunky. It's slowly getting better."
3,quick overview,"Great quality, excelent printing, typography, covering and colors.It's OK cause of the photos inside as they don't fully and compleatly describes William's photography as should be in Guide book, I think. Overall good book but the list of photos could be better!"
5,"Space, the final frontier","Big, sturdy, good looking and rock solid.Oh yeah, and the stacker 810 isn't bad either.lolYou could drop a Chevy 350 with blower and nox in this thing.Sometimes I walk inside this monster to hide from the wife.What I am saying is, it's BIG!!!Good airflow, upgradeability, and did I mention roomy?buy this now.Go ahead. . . . I'm waiting . . . . buy it, you'll see."
4,Doctor recommended for sensitive skin,"My dermotologist told me to try this lotion because my face is extremely sensitive, and it has worked wonders. My face is less red and scaly, and it doesn't clog pores like other lotions. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has dry, sensitive, or combination skin."
3,what a deal...but that case/band broke :(,"For the price you can't beat it!! I got this because I wanted a cheap replacement for my more expensive watch, while I was trying to find a battery for it. The battery for my nike watch ended up costing about half of the price of what this watch costs total!!My peers says this makes me look really old, but I think it's rad. It does what I need it too, and that's all that matters.**UpdateDuring my second year of use, while commuting on bike, my watch fell off. I found the case frame/band interface cracked and propagated enough so that a portion of the watch case broke from the rest of the frame.My father's same watch has done the same. Unfortunately our watches broke at the frame and not the band. Therefore, we're now looking for something more robust like a g-shock. We take good care of our stuff (even if it's cheap), so this is a big downer :(All in all, it's still a cool watch, but not worth my money (even at this price)."
1,"NOT water resistant to 165 ft, only splash and rain resistant","Hi, I'm sure this product is great, but it's not actually as advertised. The manual the watch comes with states that that the water resistance capacity for the watch depends on the water resistance rating on the cover of the watch. According to the manual, the water resistance rating ""Water Resistant"" only protects the watch from rain and splashes, where as the 165 ft rating would say ""Water Resistant 50m"" on the watch cover.AMAZON CHANGE THIS DETAIL ON YOUR AD.They gave me a full refund by the way."
1,This item is incorrectly spec'd,"This watch is NOT rated water resistant to 165 feet as in the Amazon description. The watch itself and the Casio website rate it only as ""water resistant"" which is no good for anything but a little damp weather. In other words NOT rated for swimming or any other mild submersion in water.The one star is for the incorrect Amazon specifications, not the quality of the watch."
3,An OK wristwatch,"I needed a cheap sports watch after the last one I had broke. The last one was a more elaborate Casio, but I found I never used all it's capabilities. I opted for this one because it's feature set is much smaller and it's cheap. So far, so good, but it's the same type of cheap resin strap the the former one had-- in my experience these straps tended to break and had to be replaced every 4 to 6 months. I'm sure this will happen with the new watch as well."
3,You get what you pay for...,"This watch wasn't that expensive, but I was still expecting a bit more. The watch looked like a kids toy watch. Disappointed."
4,Great value super light weight,"This watch is an amazing value. I misplaced my Casio G shock and decided to purchase another cheap replacement until my G reappears. I was disappointed when I first saw the light weight watch I had purchased. I'd say I have an average to small wrist at 7.5"" circumference... so if you have a large wrist this band will be too small.... However after a few days I begin to appreciate the stripped down efficacy of this $9 purchase. The watch is all but unnoticeable while on my wrist. I have the features I used most on my G... keeps time well and has a stop watch function. durability and longevity have yet to be proven... still a good buy as long as this lasts only a year."
2,Not what I hoped for,"While this seemed to clean basic spills well enough I didn't think it worked as well as another specialty cleaner. Also, this product costs more than the preferred cleaner."
3,wonderful support but arms fell apart after a year.,"My boss had purchased this chair for me after I injured my back. It has wonderful support. But, the arms started falling apart and it wasn't even a year that I 've had this chair. I called OFFICE DEPOT and was given a # to Furniture at Work, which wasn't correct. After my 3rd call to Office Depot I finally was able to speak to a Customer service manager who looked up my office's buying history and found the exact information on the chair. If you have a problem with this chair contact: Raynor Marketing LTD. at (800) 637-0005 and let them know what problem you are having with this chair. There is a 5year warranty on this chair. They are going to send me 2 new arms."
3,Same problems as Kristie,"Over all - this is a comfortable chair, by far the best I have had. Like Kristie however, the arms on mine also have started to split and come apart. If Raynor Marketing will supply new arms, I will be 100% satisfied. I spend greater than 12 hours/day at my desk, and this chair has kept my back and shoulders in great shape."
5,Straight From the Heart,This movie was outstanding. A heart warming movie. It was filmed in Wyoming and the landscape was beautiful. The horses were beautiful. To see wild mustangs running across open range takes your breathe away. Andrew McCarthy was outstanding in his lead part of Tyler. Terri Polo played her part well. This is a movie you will want to watch over and over.
4,For horse lovers and more,"First of all, let me say that this movie is a must for horse lovers.The shots of the western scenery and wild horses are truly awesome.The story is sweet even if somewhat predictable. I look for movies that are family friendly and this one gets my approval."
3,Christmas,"I liked this movie alot. It is light holiday fare...and not especially poignant...but I'm glad to have it as part of my ""Christmas movie"" collection. The acting was believeable...the chemistry between the leads was nice, and the plotline, although not especially inventive, was very watchable and entertaining."
5,Straight From the Heart,"I LOVED THE MOVIE! I saw it last evening for the first time with my husband. Yes, he actually sat through it. It was wonderfully acted. A great love story from start to finish. Great acting by Andrew McCarthy and Teri Polo."
3,Hallmark Movie,"I liked this movie well enough, but I thought the story line, sub-plots, and charactorizations were underdeveloped. For example, when Jordon and Tyler first meet, the kernels of ""he's more than a stupid cowboy"" are planted with his knowledge of an obscure painter that she mentions and his Thomas Kincaid painting, but nothing further about it is explored or mentioned. And they never discuss that he went to college."
3,Lovely Movie for a Budget DVD,"I brought this DVD based on the reviews and also the price. I was pleasantly surprised!It ia a clean romantic movie and the location where this movie was shot is just beautiful.This production is well worth your viewing time.If you like romance movies, you will enjoy this production.Watch it for what it's worth and you just might find like methat it is a nice clean production for a Budget price DVD.This DVD is a keeper!"
4,A Good Value For The Price!,"The cable appears to be made fairly well. The wire itself is very flexible providing good freedom of movement while playing. The connectors are a standard nickel plated surface connector with slimline, easy grip molded outer shells. The short strain relief at wire end of plugs should help increase cable life, but could be a little longer. Cable comes with a pack of colored identification rings to change the color code ring on the plugs if desired, and the standard Monster Cable guarantee. Overall, a nice cable for the buck."
2,Not sturdy,"While the concept is good, there is no way to securly fasten the blue tubes to the main body, so they keep flying off and need reattaching as each child crawls through at their normal breakneck speeds. I would avoid it to be honest."
2,"Nice idea, terrible execution","This is a great idea, but since the tunnels don't attach to the ""junction"" they come out EVERY time a kid crawls through them. Every time! Definitely not worth the money. Spend a little more on a better quality product. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
5,Love it,Good quality for the price. 5 grandchildren under 6 love it. Easy to fold up. Would like if the center was a pop top so they could stand up.
2,Looking for Hollies live performance video? Save your money!,"The DVD contains four Beat Club lip-sync performances, each with the beginning of the video shaved off and replaced by a graphics only title screen - presumably because the Beat Club intro originally appeared there. There are better performance videos of the Hollies out there, I just wish someone would put out a collection of them. Meanwhile, save your money."
3,Not as good as I had hoped but....,"I really love the Hollies, especially Alan Clarke, but I was a bit disappointed that there were only 4 songs on the DVD, and they were not the most popular songs. Although, I really do love Sorry Suzanne! It's a great little song. Still if you love the Hollies..as I do, it might be worth it just to have a copy of the way they were back then. Which is how I'm looking at it. I didn't care for all the ""advertisements"" of all those other groups. They were mostly ""B"" songs, not the popular ones. I thought the quality was good."
2,Dismal rip-off,"3 German tv ""live"" performances from '68-'69 totalling 14 minutes. The first song, ""Homburg"" is summarily ended before the last note. The next two (""Quite Rightly So"" and ""A Salty Dog""), taken together, are of historical significance. The fourth song, ""In The Wee Small Hours of Sixpence"" is excerpted from the DVD ""Procul Harum Live"" (1971), another German tv production.Otherwise, the dvd is a ""jukebox"" commercial for classicpictures.co.uk. And do you really want to watch a jukebox anthology of ""live"" performances with self-promoting advertizements pasted across the video? This Procul Harum is for completeists who cannot get these early videos from another source and want to buy a mere 14 minutes of vintage footage Of course, in that case, then by all means."
1,Dum Dummer & Dummist,These cartoon character drawings are plane ugly. We don't need another Ren & Stempy like show start make shows that has sence. The director of this show is an amature same goes for the cartoonist. One of those boys always sticks his tounge out. I wish Cartoon Network would canceled the show.
3,"Five stars for the show, three for the DVD!","Okay, I have been watching the funny antics of the ""Ed, Edd n Eddy"" cartoon show since they first premiered in 1999. (I was in the seventh grade at the time) In addition, I NEVER get tired of its smart, witty humor and crude animation despite the fact that some of the newer episodes REALLY suck! I'm very glad to FINALLY see creator, Danny Antonucci and everyone else at AKA cartoon release the Ed-boys on DVD! However, the title of this is a lie, considering the fact that some of the episodes are NOT of Season One but also a bit from Season Two! Secondly, why not give us ALL the episodes for Season One in one little package (like how Fox did with ""The Simpsons"" and ""Family Guy"") and then do the other Seasons as well? This is a great show, but I think it deserves a better DVD treatment which is why I only give this item three stars. I'm hoping they'll eventually come around (and I think other fans would agree with me) and give us FULL SEASON boxed sets!"
5,"THE ED,EDD,N EDDY DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","To let you know I am going to buy it as soon as it comes out.The reason is that IT IS GOING TO BE THE BEST!!!!!Here is why...ED:ED can not be not funny!He is the funniest guy EVER!!!There is not a single saying that he says that is not funny!!!!!EDD:He is always funny when he does every thing that ED and EDDY do.EDDY:EDDY can be funny by his dally scam. His scams are funny because it always turns out, that he doesn't get one quarter.These are things that are just about the EDS,but if you want to see KEVIN,JONNY,NASS,SHARA,and the rest of the culdesac,then I think you should get this DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This film could've been done by a 13 year old kid with a [...] budget! All they did was put together some horrible movies into a clash that was hopefully going to have enough cool alien stuff to ignore the fact that it makes no sense at all. Sadly, they fail. There is no plot, other than ugly and poorly done aliens from different crappy films showing up in clips that confuse the snot out of you. I couldn't even FINISH the movie after the first half hour of torture."
4,I didn't want this book to be over,"I had read Lady Sophia's Lover (the second book in the series) a couple of weeks ago. And I found that I wanted to know more about Grant and Victoria. So I bought it on my Kindle and I have to say that I do not regret that decision.I wanted the characters to be real, so that I wouldn't feel so weird for wanting their love story to have actually happened. Well then again, that might have something to so with the fact that i want to find a Grant Morgan for myself.So I give this story 4 stars out of 5 for the fantastic characters and story line.I highly recommend that you buy this book, in my opinion, you will not be disappointed. =)"
3,"Good, but not her Best","The problem with this book is that Kleypas has written dozens of novels that have slayed me with their stories--I adore her, and I'll read anything she's written...but this one just wasn't up to par. If you're going to read a Bow Street Runner book, read Worth any Price...a much better read...then come back to this one!"
2,OK (as in I finished it) but Silly,"The last book in this series, Worth Any Price was awful and had I known Someone to Watch Over Me was part of that series I may not have picked it up. It was an OK read, but silly. (SPOILERS) The hero Grant, who is supposedly so brilliant, is actually not very bright, it's obvious from the start that the woman he is with isn't Vivien. He is also rather petty to lie to an amnesiac to get back at her for some dumb lie she told once. The villians are obvious immediately. The heroine really never gets to show much of her personality. It's too bad Kleypas wasn't brave enough to make the amnesiac really the prostitute Vivien, but she takes the easy way out with the twin storyline. Oh well, I will probably read the next book, Lady Sophia's Lover since I liked the character Ross in this book. I'll buy it used though."
3,Didn't Care For This One,"I never got a handle on who exactly Grant Morgan was. The way in which the author described him made him seem loveable, yet more like an overgrown oaf. I never understood his personality, and I never once thought he came across as a handsome, much-sought-after bachelor and hero. Just didn't fit with this guy. Given that, and the weak plot, this book rates 2 stars, but in deference to this author, I gave it 3.I actually read SOPHIA'S LOVER first, and I liked Grant Morgan, which was what prompted me to look for this book."
4,First book by Lisa and not my last....,"I was glad that I read the reviews and decided to try Lisa Kleypas. This book was wonderful! It was entertaining and kept me reading well into the night to finish. Highly recommend this book. I'm on my next Kleypas book, will let you know what I think."
5,Another Great book by Lisa Kleypas,"This book was great! I loved it. I've read almost all of Lisa Kleypas's novels, and this one is one of the best.I have read practically all of Lisa Kleypas' books and this one had me from the beginning to the end. Could not find myself to put this book down.I am looking forward to reading many more books like this one."
3,Disappointing,"This is the first book I have read from Lisa Kleypas. I was disappointed. The characters and the storyline did not keep my interest. I kept reading it, thinking it would get better because it had good reviews. I will give her another try, but do not think this book rates the stars given it."
2,Someone's not watching too well,"There were so many good reviews I was excitied to begin reading. After forcing myself to try and get involved for three days I finally gave up.From the start of the book Grant is seeking revenge on the courtesan Vivien for starting a bad rumour about him. When he finds her nearly frozen to death on the docks of the Thames river he grasps the opportunity he is looking for to seduce, dominate and then spurn her.(a turn off by itself)It was obvious to me that the woman he rescued was not Vivien as soon as she awakened. Why a brilliant runner like Grant is unable to put 2 and 2 together is frustrating. I kept skipping paragraphs to see how long it would take Grant to figure it out and begin solving the mystery of who this lovely woman truly was. He doesn't figure it out for over half the book. By now he is too much of a idiot to continue."
4,No Foul langauge,"I don't know what the first reviewer is talking about but THE LAST COWBOY is far from obscene. It is/was a production for the Hallmark Channel, which doesn't tolerate foul language, and is known for the quality and content of its family friendly programming). It is simply the story of a father and daughter who reconnect/reconcile after the death of the family matriarch, and in the process save the family farm. There is no sex, there is no nudity - it airs regularly (to this day) on the Hallmark channel I suggest those who can, check it out."
3,"Good drama, scenery and heroine",This story has potential - and the scenery and the heroine were beautiful. I'd say it was worth watching - even a second time. I think it's also worth re-doing as a film . . .The only things I'd change are:> The man she falls in love with is too hard towards her. He may miss his previous wife but there is no reason to be as unkind as he is throughout the movie.> His bringing the pony in at the end is a little lame. Again - if he hadn't been such a jerk throughout the movie his offering at the end might have made more sense.> The actor is fine . . . . I just think his character could have been softened up a little bit.The gal that plays in this movie is so worth watching that she almost pulls this movie off in the end by herself.
1,Don't Bother,"I would like to know what criteria is used to determine what songs are included on these ""All the best from.."" titles. As far as I'm concerned most of these songs don't even qualify for ""good""! Most songs have folk or rock n roll rhythms with Italian words. Even the so called classics (O Sole Mio, Volare) leave a lot to be desired. Minimal use of accordions and mandolins but lots of guitar and piano.A much better choice is ""La Musica from Italy"""
5,"Beautiful music, voice and instruments,","I borrowed these CD's from the library and did not expect too much from it. But it surprised me that the singers are excellent. These songs ""Ti amo"" ""O sole mio"" ""Funiculi Funicula"" and ""Arrivederci Roma"" are familiar for the people from Taiwan, but I discovered many wonderful Italia songs from these two CD's. CD 1 is my favoriate."
5,Just The Best Blues Guitar Around,"Folks, if you haven't had the opportunity to hear and/or see Tab Benoit, then you're missing one of the greatest blues guitarist's in today's world. This man has IT! His music is as infectious as his love for the bayous of Louisiana and the blues greats he has played with and learned from. Treat yourself to some great music when you sit back and crank it up listening to Tab sing and just wear out that Fender of his that's shown on the allbum cover. Enjoy!!"
2,"Great In Concept, Exceptionally Difficult To Actually Use","This is a great book in concept, but next to impossible to actually use unless you bring the entire book in with you and/or memorize all the workouts, routines, and exercises (which there are a huge amount). The workouts and routines are great, but it basically requires you to buy the cd that creates workout sheets for you. Unless you have a photographic memory, this is very tough.Also, like all other good workout books, the routines are mostly based on a 5 day a week in the gym for 1+ hours a day. You'll also have to eat healthy. Not really sure this is so revolutionary. Overall, good book. Really tough to use."
3,"Solid book however, a little out-dated","This is a good book, very easy read. I heard a lot of good things about this book, and finally made the purchase. NOTE: book was written in 2004, so keep that in mind. A lot of the athletes mentioned in the book are no longer playing sports-Nomar Garciaparra, Mia Hamm, and Mary Pierce-off the top of my head. Nevertheless, I felt this was a good book. Informative. Mark has really good real world analogies in his writing. As a personal trainer, I found a few nuggets to add to my tool box. Really enjoyed the movement prep section and pre-hab sections."
2,Songs indicated are not the same songs on the CD.,"While some of the songs are great, the CD does not contain several of the songs listed which include some of the reasons I purchased this CD. I am surprised that there is not a quality check prior to offering the CD for sale."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"I bought this cd a while ago to replace Some Tough City because the sound output on that cd was so low and muffled. Just the opposite on this cd. It makes your ears bleed. I like my music pretty loud, but with fidelity. None here, It's just plain screechingly loud and shrill. When I get headaches and my ears ring I know it's of poor sound quality. I can't even enjoy listening to it. Also, what's with the terrible cd cover."
2,Charlie Blue byRevlon,"I was hoping to recreate a mood from long ago but this smells like a knock-off, almost over the hill."
1,Disappointed,"So disappointing. I guess this was just wrong for my hair - I have fine long hair. It felt like my hair was covered in film, no matter how much I rinsed it."
1,Used this product for years,"I have used this shampoo for years. I ordered the product and when I was finally finished with my previous bottle, upon opening, I was suspect that something was off. The color did not look right. After about 5 uses and buying a bottle from a reputable salon, I am sure this bottle is either counterfeit or the product sold at Target and this seller is trying to pass this off as the expensive version. I would use caution before ordering this and frankly buy direct from the manufacturer."
1,Horrible Product,If I could give this 0 stars I would. I have thin blond hair and when I first started using this I had good results and told my sister she had to buy a bottle too. Half way through the bottle I started to have MAJOR breakage. My hair became so brittle I had flyaways all over the place from the breaking. The exact same thing happened to my sister's hair and she's not happy with me as you can imagine. If you want to risk your hair go for it but I wish someone had let me know about the damage this shampoo causes before I bought it. I started using Avalon Biotin thickening shampoo after I tossed this product out. Not only is it less expensive but my hair is finally starting to get healthy again and growing back. Save yourself from damaging your hair and go with the natural Biotin.
4,Its a Classic,"This book is a classic. It seems to contain just about everything. The format is simple and easy to understand and the website it very good. If you are using this for class, buying the Absolute Guide is a MUST.The Absolute, Ultimate Guide to Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry 4eTo review for tests and simplify hard concepts I also recommend the Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews 3rd Ed.Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews: Biochemistry (Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews Series), which I just love. If you want to understand Biochem, Lehninger and Lippincott are the way to go!"
4,As expected,Monster quality cables. Get the job done. it is the standard but I would search around for a little lower price.
1,stinky!,"Yikes, this is easily the most disastrous of the albums released by an otherwise fine band. Clearly coming to an end and running out of ideas musically the band have all but dried up and there's not enough left in them to make one good song. This one would have been better left unmade. The lyrics are especially trashy and the cheap hardcore metal is cringeworthy. Its all a bit embarresing really. The worst song would have to be `Sandwich' and the best, which is still pretty dire, would be `It's A Lie'. Oh, and I have to mention `Rage Against the Answering Machine' which is plain horrible. No wonder not a single song from this album made it to the `Greatest Hits' collection.Look to the earlier albums where the true colours of Ugly Kid Joe shine brightest. This doesn't do them justice."
4,THE KING ALWAYS,I HAVE WATCHED MORE OF HIS VIDEOS SINCE HIS DEATH THEN BEFORE. HE WAS A GIFTED PERSON. SO SAD... SO SAD.
4,I think it works pretty good,"This was recommended by a salonist. When I let my hair air dry w/out any products or cremes, it'll become bushy, funny looking and unmanageable. When I put BB grooming creme on it after washed and towel dried, it will cause it to air dry straighter. The only thing is it is only temporary. You'll still have to use other straighteners after about a day or so. If you wash your hair everyday though and want it somewhat straighter, this might be perfect for you. I am pretty hard on products, and this is better than many of the others I've used, and it does not flake like Bed head and alot others. I would buy it again."
4,Ghoul A Go Go !!!,"If you're a fan of horror hosts and demented daytime kid's TV shows check out the extras on this product. Bonus episodes of the great underground program, ""Ghoul-A-Go-Go"" featuring the creepy Vlad and Creighton. Great stuff. My daughter absolutely loves Creighton, a king-size hunchback mute with an obsession for classic 60s go-go dancing and who happens to horde a collection of bizarre film footage. Performances by contemporary retro-garage rock bands are a treat, too. Don't overlook this!"
1,HORRIBLE,This is the worst movie ever. Slow moving until.....the last scene where there is some violence to end the movie. There is no relevant plot and the scene work was lacking. I would not watch this movie again if someone threatened to cut my balls off. Don't waste your time.
3,"Haunted Airman 70 minutes , worthy Due to Rob Pattinson Actin","This movie was worth seeing if your a Rob Pattinson fan. The Movie could have been better, had they added more. Rob Pattinson can play a serious role, to a corky role. His acting ability is going to have him a bigger Star then Johnny Depp. I would rate this movie 3 star's only cause of Pattinson's acting ability.The Haunted Airman"
3,Only if your a Rob fan,"Ok, only if you are a Rob Pattinson fan will you get any enjoyment out of this movie. The story is horrible, it is badly written, and the ending is just ignorant. Maybe some will like it but I could have lived without ever seeing it. That being said...I am a Rob fan so I don't mind it being on my shelf which is why I gave it three stars."
2,Was a bit strange,The movie was kinda hard to follow for me and a bit on the strange side. A really dark film.
2,what a waste!,"I only gave it a 2 because it featured that yummy Robert Pattinson - otherwise, stinkeroo!"
2,plot holes,This movie started off great. A former airman dealing with the horrors of war sent to a home for veterans by the only family he has his aunt. However this movie has a lot that is unexplained. I think what they were trying to do was leave you with the sense of; is it all real? or is he just plain crazy? but in the end it didnt work. plus there is an akward scene of the airman maybe raping his aunt(it could just be her being afriad that he may kill her and he lays on top of her)? your not quit sure what is going in this scene and most of the movie.For me i was left with ALOT of questions.
4,Great CD,"Bragg is very talented. Though he's politically left, his music doesn't bring that across very much (in this cd at least.) This was my first introduction to Billy Bragg. ""you woke up my neighbourhood"", ""sexuality"", and ""tank park salute"" are my favorites. Very raw, working class appeal subjects in the first two, but quite sentimental and reflective in the third. Most people can relate to most of the cd's content."
5,A Great Reference Tool,"I was very fortunate to have access to this book as a Medical Technology student and afterwards while working in a laboratory. This book is very well cross-referenced with every conceivable alternate test name listed. A summary of the disease states that each test could help to diagnose is also listed, making this a great learning tool. Overall, I will consider this to be the most valuable laboratory reference book in my possession."
3,not too bad,"The first 2/3 of the book is devoted to an overview of mechanics, optics and electromagnetism and how developments in each led to the ether theory being abandoned. The last 1/3 is relativity. The notation is a little alien (ie K for force, b for acceleration, etc) and some of the explanations are more complicated than they need to be (eg derivation of lorentz transformations is presented much more clearly in other books). The fact many concepts are explained differently here than in other books does offer a different angle and a bit more illumination on some topics.A good book."
4,American Political Cultures,"Richard Ellis presents a wide-sweeping view of America's political cultures. It is an important work for scholars, but its usefulness has been diminished by its bibilographic approach. Placement of the notes at the end of the book and the lack of a bibliography detract from an otherwide interesting work."
3,Poorly edited,"Kindle edition was very poorly edited; contains numerous errors in spelling. It's as though someone read the book outloud to a computer and the computer misinterpreted the spoken word, so that something else ended up in the e-book version.Otherwise story was interesting and well written, held my attention."
4,Fine chart for its purpose,"I bought this chart with the intention of just having a pocket chart for student lunch cards, student hall passes, and attendance cards. I thought the pockets would hold 3"" x 5"" index cards since that is what we use at our school for the lunch cards. However the chart only fits the small cards given.. which are probably only 2"" x 3"". The chart is fine for the cards it has, but would've been better if it could hold a card that is a more standard size."
1,Moen hack,Did not last 3 months. Do yourself a favor and buy a genuine Moen replacement. My prior replacement lasted almost 15 years.
2,Hard to get out,"In removing the cartridge, the guts came out, not the brass barell,And it is on the shower in my motor home, with a fiber glass stall.So how can I get it out to install the new Cartridge??????My Hole Motor home has Moen, they are great untill you have to replace parts, and there are NO instructions,And no new clips, so for me it was a 200 mi. around trip for 3 sets of clips from LOWES..In Yuma AZ. I live in Mexico on the beach and I don't like driving up to the U.S. for part..............Some One let my know how to get the barell out................Thanks Al Brandon"
3,Good to have.,"A real treasure as a historical piece. The use of continuous film frames was an innovative idea and would have been great in books that were written much, much later than this one. (Other sites have the films re-animated.)That said/written, on the Kindle edition you can't really make out the individual frames, even when you try to enlarge them. The pictures in the the grappling section are fine because they are individual shots.Also, it looks like a few words got scrambled in the scanning process; further, judging from a couple of references in the text, there may be a couple of plates/pictures missing. Still, easily a 3-star book imho."
5,Outstanding Book,"""...a real pleasure for anyone with an interest in the skeleton and associated tissues...outstanding book..."" (New England Journal of Medicine, May 29, 2003)"
1,The book is nothing more than a series of interviews.,"I have been a Pittsburgh Pirate fan for close to 40 years and I absolutely loved Bob Prince. I expected this book to be a history of Bob Prince's career with the Pirates. What I got was a series of rememberances and reflections by people about Bob Prince. And many of these rememberances are repeated over and over throughout the book. The book also never establishes any kind of chronological pace or order, making it a very disjointed read.This is one of the first books I have ever stopped reading before I was finished. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was very disappointed."
2,"Product # 38026 Haynes Repair manual: Malibu 1997 -2003, Alero 1999-2003, Cutlass 1997-2000, Pontiac Grand Am 1999 - 2003","This book is a 30% book, 30 % repair information and 70% waste... This manual-38026 by Haynes leaves the do it yourselfer out of the picture and send us to the shop...It is missing vaccum diagrams, electrical specifications (which make it impossible and pointless to repair based on this information)... It is missing repair procedures... Complete waste of money!"
4,A nice trio of Brand X CDs,"Well, I guess I'll go ahead and be the first to write a review of this Brand X release. This 3 CD set features two Brand X releases from the 1990's. The first being ""X Communication"" from 1992, and the second 1996's ""Manifest Destiny"". Both are great CDs from a stripped-down lineup including Goodsall, Jones and the highly competent drumming of Frank Katz. The third disc is a live recording from September 27, 1979 in New York city. A terrific live set with a classic line-up including Phil Collins. Great music and some entertaining stage banter as well. Not up there with the first five Brand X releases, but a great set, and well worth the price."
1,Portmerion tea cups received broken,Unfortunately I received set of 6 Portmerion tea cup with a dish broken; I decided to send back product but I'm in europe and the cost to give back the product is quite the same of the product itself; and Amazon seems not to refund such expedition cost
4,"Good guide, great list of cultivars","I thought this book provided a great overview of different berries, how to grow them, and which ones to pick. Some of it was a little basic and something that is covered in any good gardening book, but the real value of the book, and thus the 4 stars is the comprehensive list of berry varieties and their qualities."
5,very pleased,This sause pan does a good job cooking as I expected it to. I love how easy it is to clean. I use it almost every day and I have never had to scrub it with SOS pads or clenser. It is almost as easy as a non-stick pan to clean.
4,"A good pan, if a little touchy.","This pan, with its heavy bottom and glass top works just fine. It heats quickly and cooks well. But be careful. Use care with how hot you make it. The pan tends to burn things if you use too high a heat. I've used it for rice and sauces. It worked fine, but it burned the bottom of the rice because I had it turned up too high. Then next time I was more careful and the rice came out fine. Pay attention and it'll do a fine job for you."
3,superior saiyan,"This is for atari. maybe he start to listen to the fans. first thing is first make the bad ending of the dbgt well again. dbgt is not so good as dbz. that may be so because there where different makers working with eachother. well the dbgt has no spirit in the serie. start whit a new hard breaking db serie.now lets talk about the game dbz budokai tenkaichi. there is no transformation in the game. have you lost your marvels. dbz is all about martialarts en that means its all about getting better, getting stronger, the hunger for superior bean. if you can't transform any more that means there is no spirit anymore.This is how the ultimate db,dbz,dbgt must look like:+ Transformatiom 100 %+ All most all the characters+ Very large areas+ Gets faster when you become stronger+ The story continues+ Make your own characters / just like the player of the game"
4,Dragon Ball Z Coming Back,"Dragon Ball Z has been known for its 2d-dimmension gameplay but now Tenkaichi takes it to 3-d, the gameplay great alot of character. I Loved this game DBZ got it right this time although Budukia 3 was good to. No problems her except the A.I is a bit to strong and there attacks do more damage and take up less energy. But once you master this game its game you can keep playing over and over again."
3,Dissapointed,"Pros: It's Dragonball Z, has all the favorite characters, and worlds.Cons: Bad camara angles, controls are bad and dont always respond, fighting style is different from the last games.Overall the game is OK but Amazon streaches the truth by saying that you can custom create characters but you can only customize the pre-built characters. On the box it says 57 characters but Amazon says over 60. Amazon also states there are 10 customizable attributes but there are really only 8."
2,headache alert,"Item arrived quickly and undamaged. But, although the scent is not too bad, it is a very cheap perfume. It has a undertone of like a plastic chemically smell. Probably a drying agent. This gave me a serious headache."
5,FIRST CLASS TRAIN RIDES,"I LOVE TO TRAVEL BY TRAIN.YOUR ON SOLID GROUND AND YOU CAN WATCH THE SCENERYPASS BY.I WILL NEVER FLY IN A PLANE AGAIN.I DON'T LIKE BEING 30,000 FEET INTHE AIR WITH NO PLACE TO GO.THE TRAIN HAS COMFORTABLE PLACES TO SIT AND WATCHTHE SCENERY OR HAVE A DELICIOUS MEAL OR SLEEP THROUGH NTHE NIGHT. THE VIDEOSHOWS YOU ALL THIS IN SUPBERB PHOTOGRAPHY.IT ALMOST LIKE BEING THERE.BUT ADDEDTO THIS IS WHEN THE PHOTOGRAPHY GOES OUTSIDE THE TRAIN AND YOU SEE THE TRAINFROM A BIRDS EYE VIEW AS WELL AS THE SCENERY.WITH PHOTOGRAPHY LIKE THIS IDON'T HAVE TO BE BOTHERED WITH FAIRS OR LUGGAGE.IF I WISH TO VIEW SOMEPLACEAGAIN OR SEE NEW PLACES I JUST SIT IN MY FAVORITE CHAIR AND TRAVEL BY VIDEO.THE VIDEOS ARE FABULOUS,RELAXING,ENTERTAINING,INFORMATIVE,AND A KEEPER TO MYVIDEO COLLECTION."
5,Best train video ever!,"We love to ride the train and have a pretty good collection of train videos to keep us satisfied between trips. I bought this one for my husband as a Christmas gift and I would have to say that it is the best of the bunch. It features six different rides on luxury trains around the world and is beautifully filmed and narrated. You get a real feeling for what it is like to ride on these trains. There are lots of interior shots as well as descriptions of the side trips that are taken off the train. You'll get to see what your bedroom will look like, what the meals will be and the scnery you will enjoy along the way. We would like to take every one of these trains and some of them are in destinations we had no desire to visit before. This video is among the very best in armchair travel."
2,THIS IS NOT BRIGHT!,Buyer beware: 'My Life and Style' is by a hip-hop artist who released this album under the name 'Bright' several years after the indie rock/improv band Bright had already put out 3-or-so albums.(The 2-star rating is arbitrary; I can't attest to this album's quality.)
3,"It does a great job, with a catch...","I purchased this fan about a year ago locally, and was very pleased with how well put together it seemed to be. It was very easy to put together, and it moves a lot of air, even on low. It is even relatively quiet on low, which was a feature I was looking for since I use this in my bedroom at night.My only complaint is a big one. The fan seems to resonate when it's being used, more so on low-speed than any other. As a result, there is a very annoying high-pitched whine of a constantly changing intensity that can be quite irritating. It is quite possible it is only the unit I purchased, and not a flaw through the entire line, but it's still annoying enough that I cannot give it more than three stars."
5,Good option for replacement part.,"This replacement fits great into my Lincoln LS 2000 driver side window, a bit noisier than the original part but not bad for the price."
2,Not What was advertised,"Like one other purchaser, I did not receive the item that was pictured in the ad. The instructions for installation are very vague and I am trying to research the mount that I did receive to see what it really is. Still debating over whether I will send this item back."
3,I guess I did not see the same show.,What I saw was a 2 or 3 star show...about 2 and a half. The story itself was interesting but that is about it. At times the characters were very poorly drawn. I could not help but notice that time after time they had no nose. Then sometimes only two black dots for nostrils and at other times their faces were fully detailed.Others have covered the story line in their reviews so there is no need for me to touch on it.I could recommend it at the 15 to 20 price but the current price is far to high.The sound was great..voices were good as well. This did not WOW me in anyway it was just...OK.
4,Very effective,"I bought this item a few weeks back and it works! I often work in a setting where there are people all around me and this filter allows me peace of mind as visibility is deterred. If anyone makes a special effort to see what I'm working on, (s)he's easily noticeable. I have only one complaint. This filter has reduced the brightness of my screen, which affects my work sometimes. It took me a while to adjust to the lowered brightness, but now I guess I've become used to it. Overall a good investment."
4,Privacy Filter,"The Privacy Filter is exactly what I wanted. I have some very nosey people in my office and they are always interested in what others are doing on their laptops. They can no longer see what I am doing and my excuse for having it is because it helps reduce the glare of the screen, which by the way it indirectly does! Great product!"
2,Not anti-glare,This product was mentioned as anti-glare. Doesn't work especially outside. Very disappointed. Worked ok as privacy screen. Would not buy again.
3,"Does the job, but....","This does allow for privacy without the dark filters which is great, but it has a lot of reflection making it hard to use when there is a lot of lighting and if you are nor front and center to the screen. This forced me to remove the filter when performing documentation when in a patient's home. I always would leave the filter on when my computer is in idle providing the privacy required by governmental agencies. As a result of removal and replacing the filter on my screen the filter started to come apart. So I stopped using it. Now I'm back to shutting my computer, leaving a password at sign in screen, and performing documentation with a wall behind me so I can remain HIPPA compliant until I find a filter that doesn't reflect, not too dark, and doesn't begin to separate when handled too much."
4,Very good fit,The actual filter is very good but you the tape to hold it on could be improved. Best I have found.
5,proper installation is key,"I purchased this for my laptop and on my first trip I noticed that I should have mounted the side mounts (longer tack strips) lower than I did. When you travel, the glare screen bounces around and can slide above, then out of the bottom holder. I think running the side mounts down so they covered the two bottom corners of the screen would help more. Other than that this product does what it's advertised to do."
2,Expensive and doesn't work well with brightly lit LED-based LCDs,"Unfortunately, this may be good for CCFL screens, but only somewhat darkens the ultra-bright LED-based LCDs... beware. Plus, it costs a ton for a piece of plastic...3M, time to update your product line with something that works with LEDs..."
2,"not very helpful for anti-glare, makes screen too dark","I bought this product primarily for the anti-glare feature, and it hasn't proved very helpful in that department. I only used it for a few days and then tossed it aside, as I can't get used to the dark screen. It seemed to me the privacy feature worked pretty well, but the dark, and somewhat blurry, screen makes it unfit for use as far as I'm concerned."
5,Works Great in Keeping Prying Eyes Off Your Screen!,"I have bought several of these privacy screens throughout the years and they work perfectly in keeping others sitting next to me from seeing what is on my screen. I travel extensively and work when I am flying. It is reassuring to know that the person next to me cannot see my screen or it blocks it enough that they cannot read what is on the screen very well. It is also very easy to remove, when you DO want someone to see what is on your screen."
2,HERE'S THE TRUTH...,"... I bought a privacy filter about 5+ years ago and while I needed some protection for a new external monitor, I figured it was time for an upgrade (this ""new"" one should be better, right? WRONG!). When I got it, I literally compared it side-by-side and found it was NOT the privacy miracle some are TRYING to make it out to be!: The viewing angle was NOT better! BOTH glossy sides tend to ATTRACT fingerprints! (forget it if you have a touch-screen!). I don't like the 3M logo ETCHED into the corner of the filter! And, the price (and all the long, wordy HYPE) is NOT commensurate with the ""improved"" privacy it alleges! Bottom line, it does AS GOOD a job as other privacy filters, NOT better, AND it doesn't have a matte-finish on one side (like my ""old"" filter) that prevents glare! Save your money and buy another, CHEAPER product!! Anyone who says differently isn't being completely honest with you!!!"
1,Not as good,"This product is not what I expected to be. Since I bought it, I only used it 2 times now it's a dust collector. Is there an option for zero ratings?"
1,anti-glare shield,i purchased this as an anti-glare film.. one side of the privacy film is matt finish..so it does reduce glare..but it also reduces visibility considerably if you view the screen at any angle other than a direct 90 degree angle. talked to 3-m technical and they are developing a n anti-glare only film. i will return this product ..cause it does not woek for me..but will order thenew product when it is available
1,Very Poor Product Description,"I never did manage to order the correct size of screen for my computer screen. Why couldn't 3M provide a length and width dimension in their product description. It would have helped a knucklehead like me. After ordering and returning this product twice, I decided I had wasted enough time on this item."
4,Good Product - Pricy,"Amazon has the best value for this product. Other vendors wanted nearly twice as much for the product. It works well for people who travel. However, 3M should consider pricing this more reasonabally. It is just a film you put over your screen, which at $45 to $90 is pricy. I do wish the product came with more adhesive things that hold it on the screen. Sometime it is necessary to switch laptops."
2,Where is the privacy?,This is a piece of junk. I really doubt it provides any privacy. I ordered gold and it just appears black. Also makes the screen hard to read.
2,Does not fit well on Lenovo X1 - quality is OK,The quality of the filter is OK but has some problems. If you glossy side face you it's too glossy. Dark clothes are reflecting in daylight. If you turn the matt side the glossy side reflects the screen back to it which in turn reflects it again so you see double image for the elements that are bright.Furthermore I'm rating it low because it is very important to fit well and be easily removed and re-installed. In this case this is a total fail because the X1 has about 1/2 inch margin from teh frame to the viewable area and the filter is only the size of the viewable area which means you have to glue the attachment onto the glossy part of the screen.Furthermore this not working well since the this leaves no space for the privacy screen to slide in and out which would not be the case if it were glued to the plastic frame.I would guess the proper solution is to just get a bigger filter that fits over the entire glossy part of the screen.
5,great product,This is a solid product and works just as the manufacturers describe it!It is very easy to use and I am completely satisfied.
3,SP,"I brought this product because of the amount of work I have to do in the Airports. This filter does block ou the view for the people beside me. So it works as expected.However, in few cases even if the people are slightly behind me they will be able to see the screren outline. So they will know what windows are being worked on. So that can undesirable.But overall it does a good job what it needs to do.The price point definitely needs some adjustment. I would have bought the product longtime back if it was $15-20 cheaper.SP"
3,Just ok,"There are several things I like about the filter, but absolute privacy from the next coach class seat, is not obtainable (50%), also the row behind you can see the screen pretty clearly. It is however a great improvement, in privacy, over the regular screen. I use it daily."
1,Does not work for new 11.6 Macbook Air,"This does not work for Macbook air, 11.6. You see jagged lines on filter surface, makes reading harder for you as well."
2,"PF13.3 Does Not Fit Apple MacBook 13""","I was under the understanding that was going to fit my MacBook. However, the MacBook is 13.3w, so I have returned it to place of purchase. Still looking for a 13.3w though."
5,privacy screen,I love my screen It does exactly what I wanted it to do it hides what i am working on so know one can see what I am doing I love it!!!I need alot of light on my screen to see the privacy screen takes some of that away but not much I can still see fine I recommend it highly
4,Gold the way to go,"I've had the regular 3M privacy screens on my previous PC and went with the Gold this round. There is a notable difference over the standard 3M for privacy and looks. If you don't like the Gold facing front, just reverse if for the black.As with all privacy screens you do faintly see the filter affect your viewing resolution but not much and less than any others. Privacy was my foremost concern for air travel and conference meetings so this choice was great. When I use out of work, I just remove the filter.The only improvement I wish all screens had were better, more discreet attachment tabs. Ultimately, I believe the best would be to have a flexible static film (like what they use on advertising wraps on retail store windows). This would attach to the PC without any tabs. This doesn't exist currently, but thought I would post this in case it ever comes round.-A"
3,Not Recommended for the MacBook Pro high-res display,"After reading the other reviews for this product, I was excited to get one and use it on my 2010 15"" MBP. I had paid the extra money for a high-res screen to make use of the larger real-estate. Unfortunately, when I received the privacy filter, it conflicted with the screen resolution, and there were black stripes across the screen where the polarization conflicted with the screen.I'm giving the item three stars at the moment, as I don't yet know whether the issue is specific to this product, or to all privacy screens when paired with the high-res MacBook Pro."
2,Be careful,"They shipped this filter in a cardboard envelope, which arrived bent. When I opened it up to look at the filter itself, the corner of the filter had a big bend in it as well- not just a warping, but bent. As a result it didn't lie flat against my screen and I had to return it.An additional word of caution- the filter is indeed 13.3 inches diagonally, but when I put it up against my laptop's 13.3 inch screen, the filter was too tall, and not wide enough to cover the screen. My screen is more rectangular, while the filter is shaped like a square. Something to be aware of before you buy.Having said that, it did appear to cut out the glare, and added a privacy dimension as the part of the screen that it covered could only be seen straight on."
1,Not for Macbook Air,There are lines on the screen and the screen appears jagged - at least that is the case with the new Macbook Air. Unusable for me.
3,It works,"It works as advertised. It's a comfort to have when you find yourself in the middle seat on a crowded plane or sitting next to someone in a crowded conference who shouldn't be looking at your screen. The reduction in screen brightness on the display is a negative but it remains more than bright enought to be useable. When ordering, remember to measure width and height of your screen since I forgot to measure height and got a model that left a half inch gap at the top. Also, keep any extra attachment strips because they wear off. On the whole, its worth it for the business travelers though I think it was a bit pricy for what I got."
2,Good but not great!,"I am an administrator in a middle school. I purchased the Privacy Filter to prevent individuals from seeing what was on my computer screen when they were in my office. Well, this only worked if individuals were right over my shoulders. If they were sitting/standing anywhere from 2 to 3 feet away, they could see everything on my computer screen. That just didn't work for me."
4,3M Privacy Filter,This product does exactly what it is designed to do and that is to maintain privacy of the data on the computer screen. It does darken the image somewhat. Overall it is satisfactory.
2,Not very private,"The price is good for a privacy filter screen, but the performance in terms of actual privacy is not impressive.A good filter has a small area from which the computer screen can be seen - ideally, just by the user. This screen's viewable area is rather large, allowing people in quite a range to see what's on the screen.We got this as a gift for a niece. Testing it out at home first, we put it on my spouse's laptop and from almost every position in the room I could see the computer screen clearly. If you truly need privacy, move on."
1,What a disappointment!,"I looked forward to working outside on my computer, so I waded thru all the different kinds of filters to find the one for my particular laptop. It isn't much better than a screen without a filter! So expensive & so disappointing."
4,Good privacy - no anti-glare feature,"This product does a good job of providing privacy. At an angle, the screen is blocked out. This doesn't provide any anti-glare benefits. I was hoping it would do both."
3,Good but not great,"The product does it job of privacy from the side. But the little adhesive comes out if you take off the filter too often. Its somewhat of a privacy filter because someone behind you can see your screen. But man, taking it off and putting it back on again is a real pain. Especially, when you have to clean the screen sometimes. I have a tablet PC, interestingly it works even for tablets."
3,"Good, but bad moiré pattern on MacBook Air 11.6""","This is my third 3M Gold privacy filter, and in general I like them. But I want to let everyone know that I bought this for my late 2010 11.6"" MacBook Air, and there's a pretty bad moire pattern with this privacy filter on that screen. (I tried both ways, with the gold side out and the gray side out. I also tried rotating the filter upside-down (so that the little finger notch was on the bottom), and I tried changing the screen resolution. But to no avail. There are diagonal lines with the screen on, and they make the edges of the objects on the screen appear jagged. I assume this is just random dumb luck based on whatever the PPI of the MacBook screen is.At first I thought that I wouldn't be able to stand it.. I guess you get used to it, and it's better than the stranger next to me reading my screen. But it is super annoying and I might try to find another solution. Bummer. :("
1,product does not work as advertised,"The product does not work as advertised. It does not block the view of your screen, unless you look at it from an inclination of about 80 degrees. It just obscures your screen making it more difficult to read text displayed at the screen but still making it possible to see what you are doing. There is no way someone will believe that you are working in front of a turned off computer as others stated. The notch the filter has in it's top side is also very disturbing. The filter will cut down brightness of the screen in say aprox. 10%, so the notch will be seen as a very bright spot on the screen. The upsetting thing about this notch is that there is no need for it to exist.In conclusion, if you want a filter to block the view of your screen as advertised by this product, don buy this one, since it does not the job."
2,Toria,"This item was purchased and just sits in a cabinet now. I do not like how it makes the words appear smaller and it is not good for road trips. I was told, it would minimize the suns glare when outdoors but it does not do that at all. However, if you are looking for this product to only filter privacy and nothing more, then it may be okay for you...just not for me! But then again, everyone ALWAYS gets different results from the same product."
2,3m privacy filter,Didn.t like it one bit..wasn't.t what I thought if someone walk in the room they can still see....what ever is on my laptop..though it had more privacy than that.wouldn't.t recommed.
4,I imported opium and got hooked on it.....,"Not that long ago I bought opium and was really impressed. I even shared opium with my friends and they seemed to like it too. Opium helps me relax and offers a lot of rythem. My ex-girl friend from Thailand said her grandmother was addicted to Opium too, but the band does not sound like someting she would listen too. Oh well, i enjoy Opium and think they even sound better than most of the wannabe Depeche Mode, in fact they sound better than a lot of DM albums. Check out Opium, the techno poppie sounds are awesome...."
5,amor fati,"nietzsche is the only man who dares to speak truth. he is the antagonist of the lepers of the heart who claim to possess knowledge.if you have a weak stomach, you should never eat the raw truth beyond good and evil has to feed you. the truth he speaks contains no additives,the truth he speaks is a conviction laxative. if you are ""stout-hearted"" enough for this book you will love it. if you are fed up with lies and have nihilist tendencies, this book will revive you. his craft is brutal honesty, his prose is beyond comparison, and his books are magic portals into ""truth""."
4,A good book to start off with,"I bought this at the same time as I bought Zarathustra. This one is much easier to read, and still very interesting."

4,Planet Called Earth,Modern physics extends its horizons far beyond the everyday experience upon which all the commonsense ideas of classical physics were based. We are thus bound to find striking deviations from our conventional way of thinking and must be prepared to encounter facts that sound quite paradoxical to our ordinary common sense. Printed in 1941 at the high point of the war this review is of the later edition from 1963. 257 pages - hardcover bound - released both with and without a dust jacket. The earlier edition has a impressed hardcover board and gold text on spine edge - Because of production issue a limited number were release - Strike halted the 1963 release before the complete run was finsihed. This book is a classic for anyone in the field of green energy or enviromental science or has a love of the planet we live on.
4,Good product,"These blousers are made of sturdy material and are just the right color to go with ACUs or ABUs. The Velcro and elastic used are of good quality. I gave these blousers a 4 rather than a 5 because the price is a little high and they are just a bit small. I am not a big guy, and they were too tight for me at first. However, after leaving them stretched for a week, they were fine."
5,The Temple Tiger and More Man Eaters of Kumaon,"I first read this book just after it was first published some 50 years ago. It was, I recall, a pleasure to read then and doubly so to re-read the account of Corbett's adventures again today. Jim Corbett's somewhat matter-of fact, understated style is a delight to read and his simple yet vivid descriptions of the Indian locale and the people, who play a part in his story are those of a man that loves and deeply understands this land and its people. Corbett is no wanton destroyer of wildlife but a protector of impoverished and often terrified communities who understands and explains with sympathy, why the prey he hunted were forced to become what they were."
2,Total Waste,"I wanted something to improve the 2 bars of my Dlink DIR655 router.This certainly was not it. It took my bars down to 0 to 1 and at times-NONE-. You cant move it far, as the cable is only 3 feet. Maybe it worksfor some people in certain circumstances, but not for me. I returned it."
1,Waste of money,"I added this to a D-Link 625 in hopes of boosting the signal.It was recommended for my model router. My ""bars"" went from 3 or 4 (very good to excellent) to 1 to 2 (very low to low...and sometimes no signal at all!)I moved it all over the place and it stayed at a very low level. The antenna that came with the router was much better. I am returning it."
3,Don't expect huge signal gains,"These antennas work as advertised, but don't expect miracles or large signal gains. Even when mounted high (which is challenge with the itty-bitty cable D-Link provides) there is not a huge improvement. I am not sorry I purchased them, but just be aware they are probably not going to solve your signal issues by themselves."
5,"0 to 4 bars, just like that.","I bought the D-Link DWA-556 for my computer very recently, and although it worked fine, the signal strength was a tad low (after all, I am in a basement with several walls between me and the access point). I bought the antenna to try to fix the problem, even if it only helped a little. After a very quick install (we're talking 2 minutes), the antenna worked wonderfully. Before, I had 0 (yes, 0) bars, and Windows actually said I didn't have a connection (even though the wireless worked fine). Now, with the antenna, I have 4 bars, and could probably get all 5 if I played around with it enough.The only thing to know is that PLACEMENT IS CRUCIAL!!!! That's for both where you mount/place it, AND how you angle the three different antennas. A few inches is all the difference between 2 and 4 bars.Seriously. I'm impressed. Regardless of how the DWA-556 might be failing to perform as it should, the antenna easily makes up for it."
4,"D-Link ""n"" antenna","Results of installation was the near-doubling of received signal strength and consistent throughput(through 4 walls (2 ext'l,3 int'l). Dropped internet connections have been almost entirely eliminated (from 5-6 x per hr to <1 per day). It was not the ""best"" solution, but it was the most practical solution for this situation."
4,Great book,"The author actually experienced first-hand the subject she is writing about. She was on the other side of the fence, so to speak. She obviously knows what she is talking about. Occult practices brought up in the book are satanic healing, meditation to achieve control of the Alpha brain waves and other such things. Recommended reading for those people who take ""psychic"" things lightly."
3,I've read better...,"This wasn't great but it wasn't that bad either. At times the constant jumping around was confusing. Timothy Findley does tell a good story but there were a lot of gaps that rather left me hanging.It's a long, long story of a boy/man trying to find out who his father is. His mother suffers from various forms of maddness and the reader follows her mother's and then her life up to her death. I found the first part of the story better than the second. The part where Lily goes to Europe was vague and disjointed and none of the people she meets there were developed.Having said that, I still quite enjoyed it."
1,Not very good,"I am certified on Exchange Server 4.0, 5.0 and 5.5 and have had experience supporting Fortune 100 companies in rolling out Exchange. I reviewed this book looking for a good study guide I could recommend for our clients and staff.Simply put...look elsewhere for a study guide, as this one doesn't cut it. It seems very confusing, and I'm not exactly sure why they make everything seem so much more difficult in Exchange than it really is.Admittedly, Exchange has a confusing interface, but it's actually quite easy to set up, troubleshoot and get running in real-life. Even in an Enterprise environment with cc:Mail, Notes, IMC connectors, and such...normally the worst thing you need to worry about is migration issues.This book makes EVERYTHING in Exchange seem difficult, and skips very important issues that are not only on the test, but are some of the biggest issues encountered in real-life.Avoid this book. We need less ill-trained Exchange support people in the world as it is."

5,good quality gloves,"These are good quality gloves that I use not only for mechanic work, but also for general work around the house."
4,Handy gloves,"These gloves fit well and can be handy for many situations, but please do not take the earlier guys advice and use these as motorcycle gloves, that is not what they are intended for. If you go down from your motorcycle wearing these you will certainly lose your skin."
4,Mechanixwear Rocks,These gloves are excellent for work that requires dexterity and protection. My husband uses them when working on his 380SL convertible and doesn't damage his hands as he used to do when working in small spaces.
3,VOLLEYBALL DRILL BOOK;GAME ACTION DRILLS,THE BOOK HAS THE SAME DRILLS AS ANYOTHER BOOK NO NEW DRILLS DESCRIPTION VERY VAGUE.
1,"There are far better, less biased college guide books","So, a book that receives praise from conservatives such as Thomas Sowell and Dr. Laura Schlesinger ought to sound alarm bells immediately in the head of the person seeking a BALANCED college guide. The reviews of the schools inside pretty much criminalize intellectualism, freedom, and the Young Democrats.I've been in the college guidance business for almost 10 years--spend your hard earned money on one book, The Fiske Guide to the Colleges. He provides factual, well-researched, and constantly updated information with NO POLITICAL BENT, allowing the reader to USE THEIR OWN BRAIN to decide whether or not a particular campus will suit their needs."
1,You call this a book?,"No wonder why Marxism died. If this is a political analysis, then my name's Boris Yeltsin!"
1,Enhancing CAD Drawings Photoshop,The school booklist posted the wrong book for the class. Had to order another book.Tried to contact seller for return information before the return deadline by email. Never heard back.Now I am stuck with a book that I do not want. Will never order from this seller again.
2,Get the Hooter Hider instead.,I didn't like this product at all. It's hard to see your baby. The material is too warm. I got the Hooter Hider and love it. It has boning material in the neck so you can see your baby easy. It breaths much better so your baby doesn't sweat so much.
4,This One Book Will Change Your Life... Forever!!!,"Napoleon Hill is an amazing Author... I bought Think and Grow Rich the first time when I was 25...only wish I found it sooner!The book will change your life for the better... I've bought this book about 4 times looking for the original version... I bought this version for a gift because the writing was bigger and I luved the book jacket.... it entices one to read it not just keep it for a paper weight! Every year I reread this book, I write out a where I am now... since I read it every year and I check how much I've grown and expanded in that time mentally/ physically/ socially/ and financially/ this book keeps me on track! #1 in my library and I read a hundred books a year.... My favorites I read again and this is one of them, it brings shivers to my spine. The best confirmation it's right on target!!! Thank you Napoleon Hill ! Worth every penny!"
5,"Thank God, it took only 8 years.","It took me 8 years to get the secret Napoleon Hill was talking about. I had purchased the book in 2003 and had been reading and rereading with curiosity about the secret. But curiosity didn't help me.As Napoleon says you will get the secret only when you are ready for it. Thanks to the jolt life gave to me recently, I became ready for it unknowingly. And I had the AHA moment. I saw a brilliant change happenning within 12 hours. I had been trying for this change for 2 years.Please keep reading the book. It has the magic recipe. But this recipe is too simple to grab your attention. But when you will be ready for it, this recipe would steal your heart.Now I look at those 8 years and feel grateful that I didn't take more time to understand the book."
4,Good Reading for Developing and Maintaining a Positive Attitude,"This book was interesting reading for me.It explains how the laws of attraction work,and how you can develop this skill to drawthe energy closer to you andmake your dreams and/or wishes possible.I actually won quite a large amount of moneyrecently. Maybe it was a coincidence or maybe thisattraction attitude I developed is working?It takes time to develop this way of thinking.You have to have a positive ""mindset"" and follow itdaily for it to work.I also liked ""The Secret"" on DVD. It was this book thatinspired it I believe.There are many who believe in the LOA and there are somewho doubt it. If you have an open mind, you may find thatthis book will show you the way to prosperity.It is an old book, but the principles remain the same."
5,Great Book!,"I still can't believe I hadn't read this book before. I've been an entrepreneur for years and I'd always heard that it was required reading if you strike out on your own. I recommend it to anyone who's looking for inspiration to better themselves. It's funny, this book was published in 1937, so you think it would be a bit dated (it is in parts, but it's not distracting), however the lessons are timeless. It almost feels like Mr. Hill is reading today's headlines and extracting the lessons we need to learn and applying them in this book. Some parts get a little hokey pokey at the end, but hey, I figure whatever worked for him he's passing on to us. Take out of the books what works for you, leave the rest if your not comfortable with it."
2,outdated version,This version of Napoleon Hill's classic is the outdated one containing numerous errors. There is at least one other edition that has a tremendous amount of new research material. It and others are far better for anyone who truly wants to understand the Think and Grow Rich philosophy and techniques.
1,The 2010 by Simon and Brown edition of the book is AWFUL!,"The book itself is great. But the most recent issue is very hard to read, they have hyphenated words in the middle of sentences on every single page. The book quality is terrible. There are lots of CAPITAL letters that also makes it hard to read. Do NOT buy this issue of the book. Buy an older one."
5,READ THIS BOOK!,"To all whom may be seeking help through 'self-help' books; you can't read everything and trust me I've read a number of these books. However, if you are going to read one book, make it this one: Think and Grow Rich. The chapters can be read independently, it not only tells you what to do, but how to do it. Now read it...blessings.Leon"
1,Think and Grow Rich,"My copie it is in the garbage, where it belongs.This book does not make any sence at all."
5,"Great book, must read material","This is one of my favorite books, I must have read at least 5 times over the years and plan on reading it another five times in the next ten years. It's the best of it's kind, hands down."
3,OK,"The principles laid down in this book are presented better in other books (try Peter Drucker's), but this may have been one of the first to lay them down, so perhaps should be given some credit for that. It is badly written, though, like an eighth grader wrote it. And the bit about psychic abilities is total garbage."
1,Think... and buy something else!,"This book has been given many good reviews and that is wonderful. However, it was not any use to me. I found it an extremely difficult read with no concrete suggestions. In fact it was totally USELESS. The author simply repeated, ""when it comes to you, you will know what it is"". After waiting for ""it "" to come to me for over a 100 pages, I gave up.My wife read it and she also gave up and long before I did. For those of us who like concrete in your face material then I suggest that you ...Think and buy something else. If you like nebulous expressions this may do for you. Certainly I do not 'think' that anyone will get rich from simply reading this book."
1,A book on pseudoscience at best.,"I bought this book expecting to find good advice. Instead I found a bunch of misspellings, grammatical errors, and bad ideas. Think and Grow Rich is just a financial twist on popular pseudosciences.If you believe in one or more of the following, this book is for you:1) The healing power of magnets2) Rocks (or crystals) have magic properties3) Mind-induced levitation is possible4) Psychic powers/phenomenon5) Ghosts6) Bending a spoon with your mindI think you get the idea. This book has nothing to do with accumulating wealth. It's about teaching pseudosciences."
4,Still a Classic,"Written more than 70 years ago and the ideas still pertain to life today. There are some ideas of Napoleon's that I do not agree with however many are ""right on""! This book will help you gain awareness and conciousness and help you in your spiritual journey."
3,"Interesting book, but lots of typos in this version","The book was recommended to me by someone who is financially successful. I have had a chance to put the ideas into practice yet, so I can't comment on the ideas presented. However, I do have two general comments.I don't know what the original looked like, but this version has a LOT of typos which give the appearance that this version was a self-published book, done by someone with another version by their side while they typed it word-for-word into their own computer.Another thing that bothered me is that the author vascillates from calling Christ ""The Master"" and equating him with ""other great leaders"" who used the power of the sixth sense in their life's work. There are others, as well. As a Christian, that bothered me a great deal. I'm not saying you shouldn't purchase the book for that reason, just that you should be prepared for it."
5,This book is a treasure,"I have read this new book four times and will keep studying it until I can apply all of its principles in my professional and personal life. It is the most inspirational, yet ""common-sensical"" book I have ever read. Napoleon Hill spent a third of a lifetime doing research on successful people, many of them some of the richest and most powerful people on earth. He then distilled all that research down into what he calls the 13 Steps to Riches (and ""riches"" does not just mean money). This book is already helping me to lead a fuller, richer, more productive life. I can't recommend it highly enough. It's the best book I have ever had the pleasure of reading. As I said, it's a real treasure of information and inspiration."
2,"Get the Black Leather-bound version, not this one.","$5,000,000 dollars. That's how much I'm going to initially raise for my company. I am going to do it by using the Think and Grow Rich method as laid out in Napoleon Hill's ORIGINAL book. Don't get an amended, annotated, updated or otherwise diluted book. Get the original. And get the best version of the original.This is an important tool for making your dream into reality. Get the best quality tool. Get the Black Leather-bound Gold-gilded version for just a few bucks more. The quality difference is worth it. Here is the link the the best version of this book:Think and Grow Rich: Teaching for the First Time, the Famous Andrew Carnegie Formula for Money-Making, Based Upon the Thirteen Proven Steps to RichesRead my review attached to the Deluxe Black leather bound version. That book is a workbook. It needs to hold up to being put to work.God speed in making your dream into reality! (even if you don't know what your dream is yet)."
3,Not for all cd players,"Great content, but this will only play on certain players. I was able to play oit on the DVD drive of my notebook. I could not get it to play on my mp3/cd player."
2,ok-but poorly written,This book is a rehash of the law of attraction. It may be the first book to really emphasize the relationship between thought and deed. It is written poorly by today's standards and can be a bit harder to read because of it.
3,Overrated compared to today's standards,"I read this book after hearing a lot of hype about how great it was. I was disappointed when I finished.Now, I realize that this was considered a phenomenal work by the standards of its time when it was written. However, it doesn't even compare to books like Brian Tracy's Maximum Achievement, and Tony Robbins Awaken the Giant Within, to name a few. Think and Grow Rich is sub-par for today's standards. Just because it was the first great work of it's kind doesn't mean it's still great. When Ford created the Model-T, it was considered by all the greatest revolution since sliced bread. Do we still drive Model-T's today? No way. They don't even compare to a car like BMW, or your average mid-grade car like a Ford Escort. I hope my point is clear. Things change and improve. So it goes with literary works as well."
5,Read this once a year!,"This is a classic business book that most successful people have read and recommend. It is one of the first popular books that really reached a mass audience with the message that what you think (your MINDSET) makes a huge difference in what you achieve in life.If you want to discover the secret and let the book speak to you, get it now, and don't read on because I'm, about to give you the overall message and I don't want to take away your discovery of the answer as you read it.As you read the various true stories from Carnegie to the author's own son, you learn that what makes the difference is your MIND and wealth and success take shape in the form of a single idea.This book is a must have for everyone's library!"
1,"VERY, VERY SLOW","This took about a week and a half, That was how long it took just to ship, from the time I placed the order. That's way to long."
1,wanna know the secret: sell books to dump peoples,"This book will not give you any advice on how to get rich, there is no magic pills or secret to be rich in this book. you better invest you're money in the book called ""awaken the giant within"" by anthony robbins, this is a much much better book for becoming rich and successful. by the way if you want a be rich put you're 6$ in mutual fund instead of bying this book."
5,Change your life,A classic copied into newer versions call 'The Secret' or some kind of power-of-positive-thinking title. Hard to beleive this was written so many years ago and is still so relivant today. I've heard too many success stories to mention that began with this book.
3,Think and Grow Rich,This was a book that was recommended by someone else. I already knew and was following the principle that it followed so that might be the reason I was not highly impressed. I believe it is a learning experience and not many people would take the time to read it. It is a little boring.
1,Retrain your thoughts,"It was about retraining your thoughts. I received one good idea from it, which was more of a reminder. And that was to write out; what you want, how you plan on getting it and how much your willing to give/do to get it."
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"Hill basically blathers about the law of attraction and how to focus your thoughts and energies towards riches. Think rich, meditate rich, envision rich, and the law of attraction will eventually make you rich. The same goes for any desire you may have.Even though this is a ""classic"" I would not recommend this book. I got about half-way through and couldn't read any longer. I found it to be horribly written. The thought process was unorganized and the wording flowery and intangible. Often the stories and illustrations were irrelevant to the lessons being taught. Overall very unpractical. I did find certain parts of the book to be slightly motivating, thus two stars instead of one."
4,A lot to manage..,"A little hard to bring it all together on one hand, however on the other hand it all made perfect sense. Good details, very common sense, wish I would have been ""aware"" enough to have found it, read it and implemented it long ago.Think and Grow Rich"
5,one of the greatest books of all time,"this book teaches:- the universal laws of success- how to deal with failures and defeats, and then turn them into opportunities- how to deal with life- how to have a winning attitude toward life, people, circumstances, ..everythingwhat i liked about this book is that:- it contains proven formulas for success, happiness, wealth (proven by 500 characters studied and discussed throughout this book)- it is supported by stories of great successful people who applied the secrets and laws mention in this book (whether consciously or un-consciously)great book."
1,A Waste,"Worthless book, a waste of money. Tells you what internal qualities you need to become rich, but doesn't tell you how to become rich. Must be much better get rich books out there."
1,Worse than Twilight,"I didn't think that I would ever read a book worse than Twilight. Then I found this book. I bought the 89 cent Kindle edition, and I should have taken 89 cents and given them to a beggar instead of completely wasting them. Well, at least a portion of my wasted money will be taxed, which might help build a bridge or something else useful.Anything that tells you that you must be completely OBSESSED with money to succeed in life is a bit disturbing. What's more disturbing, however, is that this book is so highly rated on Amazon.There's nothing wrong with focusing on making more money in life. However, this book takes it way overboard. Don't waste your money. Go buy The Richest Man in Babylon or something by Dave Ramsey, Suzy Orman, or Howard Dayton.P.S. Thank you to everyone else giving this book a one-star rating! Together we can save others from this charlatan!"
2,Basically a promotional video,"I was hoping to find an informative documentary to share with my elementary class, but this is really just an over-the-top promotional video for Texas. It is surprising that it was made by the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum and yet contains so little information."
4,worked out,"I had a little smoke coming from a Montero caused by burning oil, this stuff was ""thick"" enough to help the problem."
2,NOT HER BEST...,"I was waiting anxiously for this book since reading Someone To Watch Over Me. That incidentally is still her best book. This book wasn't terrible, but it didn't engage my interest as it did with her previous books. I agree with a previous reviewer that something is missing. The characters were not interesting and the plot non existent. I like a story that concentrates on the two main characters. Here you got a heroine with lingering memories of a dead husband and she is saddled with a daughter.I would recommend a pass on this book if you have other books to read."
1,not up to kleypas standard,no real passion in this one...and i hate when historical romance writers make their heroines too old to be innocent and refreshing.
4,I loved it...,this is one of my favorite books. i just read it again and again. how zachary loved holly and would not let her go. zachary such a strong character that you just fall inlove with him.
4,Just what I asked for....,"Finally I have a way to keep the pesky squirrels out of our fruit trees and vegetable garden. Easy setup and very sensitive. Random spray drives them away. Also very humane, no traps, no poisons, no mess. Even keeping most birds away!"
1,expensive trash,"It worked once, when we first hooked it up. Then, once we positioned it, it hasn't functioned since."
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this unit to scare the deer. It worked for about 2 weeks, then worked only a little for another 3 days, then Stopped entirely.A lot of money for 2 weeks worth of ??????"
1,"Good concept, cheap parts","We've bought 10 of these over 5 years and have 2 that are still working.When they stop working I take them apart and have found that half the time the solenoids fail, half the time the sensor/board fails. Yes, I have swapped parts, but the failure rate is so high that on average you get 2 seasons tops."
3,Didn't work for me.,"Although the specs stated that it has fittings for almost every system. It didn't work for a VW TD. The ""T"" fitting and adapters didn't adjust to the hoses and couplings of the car.On the other side, I tested the gauge and it works but with an error range that makes it not a precision tool."
4,Great read!,"This book is an interesting historical primer on the monetary policy of the French Revolution, and adds an economic dimension to the crisis that was largely overlooked in my high school study of the subject (as far as I can remember). My only complaint is that it becomes somewhat repetitive, since the French kept making the same mistake over, and over, and over, and over again. I'm not an ""end the Fed"" guy but this was a very insightful book for those worried about our monetary policy or just interested in economic history."
1,Don't Buy this Product,"This thing is junk. My daughter received it for Christmas and was so excited to get it until she tried to use it. She was crushed by how badly it worked. The picture quality was ZERO! It was ridiculously bad, even for a toy. The only reason it got one star is because it's cute looking. Disney ought to pull it off the market. Ours is being returned asap. Don't waste your money."
1,A let down,"Our daughter received this as a holiday gift, and it has caused more pain than provided enjoyment. Poor quality all way 'round. No battery life, and impossible to see what pictures have been taken unless in full sun. She's not happy since she cannot realize results at all, and so we're off to get something a bit better."
2,Not what I expected,"It works ok for the purposes of my 4 year old, however, the picture quality is not great and the camera is SUPER small. Also no display screen to see your picture. Probably going to be looking for a new one to get her."
3,Received Wrong Item,"I recently ordered the DVD ""I Thirst"" and received a CD instead. I absolutely love her music, but for $25, I was paying for her DVD, the live concert. You see why I am dissappointed? Its Easter Sunday, and we had planned to watch the concert, but can only listen. (which that is a powerful statement too, but we ordered the DVD)The case did not specify that it was a DVD or a CD.... We have now opened it, and dont know what to do. Thank you for your time in correcting this matter. - Karla Kriegel"
5,I'm On Board Now!,"I love listening in on other people's conversations (the juicy ones!), so I don't know why it took me so long to discover how much fun it is to watch Survivor. I fell in love with Amazing Race a few years ago and thought I'd probably like Survivor as well. So I bought this 4-pack and I loved every minute! I watched them without commentary first, then re-watched with the commentary on. It was a kick listening to them watching themselves and making comments about what happened or what they were feeling or dishing on other survivors. I loved them all, but Rupert made Pearl Islands and All-Stars extremely entertaining."
1,What is this Garbage?!,You get to see people make total fools out of themselves. The series has even less brains then Daytime TV
1,Will not fit copper or icemaker lines as indicated.,"It was time to replace my icemaker filter again, so ordered this one on Amazon. The problem is that this filter is made ONLY for the push-in type connection for small plastic tubing. My filter connects to a to nylon tubing line that requires screw-in metal fittings. My last filter was adaptable to either connection type, where as this filter is not. In the product description it states ""Includes quick connect fittings for installation on 1/4-Inch plastic or copper refrigerator or ice maker water lines"". I took that to mean it was adaptable to both quick connect or threaded connect as long as I had the parts...but this is not the case. So will have to buy another one tomorrow."
4,Kittey Rin,"I actually bought this CD for the song Quincy, but ended up finding other songs that I know from it. BoA is becoming one of my favorite artists from Japan, and even my friends are agreeing with me. The only bad thing, for me, is that there are quite a few songs on there that get old fast. For me, that would be songs like Every Heart and Shine We Are. However, like any CD, there are a couple like Valenti that redeem it in my eyes. For any BoA fan out there, this is a CD worth getting. Or, at least, listening to."
2,Guys..Chill,"What's all this stuff with Britney and Lindsay? Gosh. I KNOW BRITNEY AND LINDSAY ARE BETTER THAN HILARY..but but but......wait.... It's not that bad of an album...You know Avril Lavigne? She can't sing live either. But ther album rocked. It did. And as for Hilary..Okay..DON'T BUY HER CD THEN, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE! she's aiming for 3 year olds, okay? Come clean wasn't that bad....but once you listen to it for hours..you wanna strangle Hilary..I know..okay..Chillllllllllllll."
1,Poor CD,"Very bad CD. OK actor, but she is just trying to get more popular. Pop fan or not, get one of Avril Lavinge or Michelle Branch's CDs instead. They are much better. I give all the songs a 1 except ""So Yesterday"", which gets a three. Her lyrics are impossible to understand, and I can name over 20 people who can sing better. She should leave it to the pros instead of barging in and trying to get more money. Trust me, you will want to smash this CD with a sledgehammer instead of listening to this wannabe pop."
3,good but not great..,"its not really fair to say that hilary duff's voice sucks, because her voice is probably the same as everybody else's who don't have spectacular voices...her vooice is probably the same as yours. her voice is too weak to sing the songs on her album though...on this album only about 3 songs are worth listening to..."
1,Shocked,"How the bloody hell did Hilary Duff ever score a record deal??? The girl sucks: she CANNOT sing AT ALL. (she can't act worth anything either)She is the best example of the result of what is called 'studio magic'. I didn't even buy her album and I know it sucks. Because an album with a crappy singer is, obviously, going to suck. She makes Britney Spears look and sound like the greatist artist ever. I get pissed off every time I see her on tv or hear her on the radio because she is so pop and fake and made-up. You watch, she won't last much longer; she doesn't have the talent to."
4,Hey This Is Really Good Music,"As A 15 Year Old You Know I'm Into That Rap Music, But When I First Heard ""So Yesterday"" I was Hooked, Hilary Duff Is Young, Beautiful, And NOW...Talented. She Hooked Herself With A Vocal Coach And Produced A Great Album, Although I Do Not Own It I've Heard ""So Yesterday"", ""Hey Now"", ""Why Not"", And The Songs In The Lizzie McQuire Movie. I'm Downloading Her Songs Right Now, And If I Didnt Have Internet I Would Buy The Album. Highly reccomended"
4,Okay...,"First of all, to all you people that hate Hilary Duff: she is only 15!! She tries really hard and although her voice isn't as good as Kelly Clarkson, or any other celeb, she is not an adult! What I like about her is all her songs are wholesome, and she doesn't sing anything innapropriate like Green Day. Okay, I'll admit it. Her voice is not the best and I don't know what Simon Fuller would say. But, truly, her songs do have good messages like ""Come Clean"" and they have a nice beat. I would not recommend anyone who likes hard rock or is over the age of twelve to get this c.d. However, anyone who is under twelve: help yourself to this c.d. and don't get something with bad words like Green Day's ""American Idiot"" or anything like that."
1,absolute discrace,"please tell me hilary doesnt refer to herself as a musicianthere are people working in factories to bring home $100 pay checks, and Hilary Duff gets millions of dollars off of this completely shallow, gift wrapped, sugar coated piece of crap!She is the definitive meaning of the term ""Sell Out"""
1,Crappola,One word to describe this CD: crap. My little sister got this album and she listens to it all the time. It drives me nuts because the music sucks big time. Hilary can't sing and she doesn't have any good music to back her up. The lyrics are as terrible as you can get too.I've never gotten into the Hilary Duff thing at all. I think she's bogus and I think this CD really proves that!
5,Hilary Duff Metamorphosis,"This CD might be extremely expensive, however this CD is perfectly worth it. The tracks are perfectly good. I listen to this CD every single day, and I never get bored! It's very fun to listen to it. It has a lot of meaning in it! Hilary Duff is really a good performer and she will be a good singer and actress!"
1,Crapy Music,Hilary Duff sucks a**.Imature people listen to this crap.This album is a piece of sh*t.What's this f***in' b**ch thinkin'?All she's doing is makin' crapy music.This is not good pop music.I adore pop music.All of you Hilary fans don't know what real pop music is.Some fans say she has a good voice.OMG!What's the good in that voice?I hope Hilary fluff gives up her musical career someday.No wonder there's too much people dissin' this b**ch.I'd give it 0 stars if I could.But I can't.
2,try again..,"This album is almost a waste of your money. Sure, Hilary Duff is an up and coming star but maybe she should stick to acting. This Album isn't all around horrible, but really if you want to hear the catchy songs buy her single. She's a good looking young girl who im sure has good acting skills; but come one my sister can sing better than her even without all the computers and whatever the big companies use. If you really like hilary duff hey then try it out. But just keep in mind this album is not very strong and it will soon just sit in your cd case.peace"
1,Wow...,"And this is considered ""music""? Yeah okay. Wake me up when her 15 minutes are over.1 half decent track - Come clean. The rest of the album sucks. Hilary can't sing. She's just a trend."
2,bad lyrics + actress with okay voice = CD worth about $1.50,"How this CD got to be #1 is a total mystery to me. Compared to someone like Michelle Branch, Hillary Duff sounds like crap. I'm not saying she's really horrible or anything, but she definitely isn't great. In fact, if you take away all the effects that have been added to make her sound better, she's not much better than the average person. Combine that with a bunch of lyrics that would make Britney's latest hit sound meaningful, and you've got a CD that is worth about $1.50."
3,a nice start,"hmm... it seems like these days anyone can put out an album. even paris hilton making one. ouch. that's not to say duff's album is bad, but i'd say it's a nice start for a tiny (she's listed as 5'2"" - 5'3"")teeniebopper. 'so yesterday' is a catchy song, and you'll hear the songs you'd expect to see from a teen album. not bad, but not great either. buy this only if you're a fan of hers."
1,Bubblegum that doesnt have the pop,"This cd is absolutely pathetic. This is nothing against Hilary Duff, but the plain facts are that she cant sing. She is 16 and gorgeous, and a decent actress. BUt she cant sing. Almost all the people I know could have recorded this cd. All they need is a computer that will sing for them. The cd is almost all horrible bubblegum that will give you nighmares about giant pink stuffed bunny rabbits chasing you through fluffy pink cotten candy, while they are trying to strangle you. This cd has one decent song, Come Clean. the only thing bad about this song is that it is hilary singing it. It would be quite a decent song is someone who could actually sing was performing it"
1,Horrifying Hilary,"Hilary Duff's Sophmore debut is completly horrible, not to mention that she barely put any effort into it. she did not write any of the lyrics (songs) and she did not help produce it. She bacically only lent her voice. And whoever lent their lyrics for the album should be fired and be put in jail, the lyrics don't make sence (from ""So Yesterday"" ""Im keeping your old black hat, they look good on me, you're never gonna get them back"") She debuted on the highly poupular Disney Channel Sitcom ""Lizzie McGuire"" and was titled as an actress. Then she decides she wants to lend her horrible voice on an album, and now shes targeting to have an Olsen twin empire, with her own clothing line. Besides that, the CD has no melody, and the lyrics are awful. This is one Metomorphosis into a history of shockingly awful albums."
2,okay,"I think Hilary Duff is pretty and I liked the song ""What Dreams are Made Of"" in the Lizzie movie so I thought I would like this. My mom bought it for me, but I don't like it so much. The only songs I like are So Yesterday and Come Clean.Hilary's voice is too plain and I think she is trying too hard to sound like a tough girl when she is so not like that.I think Hilary should stick to movies."
1,"Hilary, Hilary....",This Cd is the worst ever. Don't waste your money on it Unless you are tone def. then it just wont matter anyways. I don't know what she was thinking when she made this cd but she needs to stick with acting. In all the songs shes basically talking and not to mention the heavy editting job the studio had to do on her voice. So if you enjoy listening to people who cant sing and have very bad lyrics pick this album up.
3,Awesome Metamorphosis,"This is a great CD, but it doesn't have really great lyrics. Hilary Duff's first album has a really great message but it needs to be stronger. The songs are great, but they need to feel stronger. I hope her second album is better."
1,Very bad!,"I got this album a week ago since I had extra cash on me and I feel so bad I waisted my money on this,the songs are awful,her voice is awful(Even Britney Spears sounds better then her)I suggest you get something worth your money unlike this!"
1,Buy Christina Aguilera or Michelle Branch Instead.,There you would hear artists who CAN SING and put emotion in there music.I heard Hilary duff CD and it sucks. She badly needs voice lesson. Badly.
2,don't know why it went to # 1 on billboard..,"ok, first let me say i do think hilary duff is a very pretty sweet girl, but i'm sorry she should stick to lizzie mcguire because she really can't sing. she even lip-sings like at her birthday bash.so yesterday-an okayish song, got on my nerves cuz it's on the radio too muchcome clean-this is one of the only songs i likeworkin it out-gay song, pointless lyricslittle voice-words don't make sensewhere did i go right?-my favorite on the cd, it's actually goodanywhere but here-another one of the few songs i likethe math-lyrics are so stupid, they're trying to compare love to math. not workin.love just is-ok, this pisses me off. a 16 year old in love? please.sweet sixteen-two words: gay song.party up-i like this song, it's okayish.metamorphosis-don't like the whole talking part in the song.inner strength & why not-both gay songs trying to send a positive message. hate songs like that.overall, don't buy this cd it only has 4 good songs."
3,Good for Boys and Girls (for different reasons),"This is pretty harmless ear candy. Possessing no tin ear myself (I used to manage a mid-level professional rock band), I can say that everyone involved in this release did his or her job admirably.Ms. Duff defines the term cutie-pie. Even though I am a proud member of the fairer sex, I must admit to some pretty unusual thoughts when it comes to Lizzie, er- Hilary. Which brings me to the point that boys will have a field day trying to crack the mysteries of a few of the more cryptic songs. Ms. Duff is walking a very fine line between being, as another popular young lady sang, not a girl- not yet a woman.I, for one, am hoping she makes the transition smoothly, and with her sanity intact- as I know firsthand what the music/recording biz can do to some unfortunate souls. My friend's youthful daughters listen to this CD quite frequently when I babysit them, and have proved that flatulence comes in many varieties: some sweet, some sour."
3,Hilary thinks singing is good HELL NO!!!!! HILARY STOP!!!,1. So Yesterday- This is probably about her break up with Aaron Carter2. Come Clean- Her voice is so off key3. Workin' It Out- Lindsay Lohan should've sang this one4. Little Voice- She tries to rap and she sucks5. Where Did I Go Right- She went wrong. She trying to be like LeAnn Rimes or Shania Twain and crossover6. Anywhere But Here- THIS SONG BITES!!!!!!!!7. The Math- Makes no sense8. Love Just Is- This is not a great song at all9. Sweet Sixteen- She acts like she is the only person in the world who is turning sixteen10. Party Up- This is the only good song11. Metamorphosis- She sings off key on this one too12. Inner Strength- Thank god it is short13. Why Not- This is good but you get sick of it
3,Ok why you hating,"Ok When your talking about fat, she is not the skinny's person around but who the hell wants sum scrawny ho with them. If you hug them you can break them. Come on she freaking is pretty and prolly puts your momma to shame, and i would know i am ur daddy. And if u think that u can do better than her, fine i cant wait to see u with a freaking miliionaire. And i dont see you with any freaking CD coming out. When you get some talent maybe you could talk. And if metamorphasis sold even 1 cd, thats 1 cd more than they bought from you"
3,Sooooo OK,"I love so yesterday, not to mention the other songs, hilary has a nice voice, buuuuuuuuut, i think she should stick to acting, her voice is sort of mettallic. NO OFFENSE! i dont recommend this to just anyone, listen to the her songs on hilary duff dot com by clicking on music, if you like them then buy it, if your not so sure then i suggest dont waste your money on the CD, bye.Huggz."
3,wow this is just not that great,you have to give her credit for trying but honetly these songs are just not great most of these songs dont make any sence it is like someone wrote them in two minutes and said alright that is good enough Hilary Duff doesnt have a great voice and is just selling this mostly to her fans. (which I am not)mostly I agree with the amazon review. the fact that this cd is on the top ten just blows my mind and I don't know why wasted my cash on this just dont I repeat dont buy this unless you are sure just look at all the other reviews it is like 5 to 1 with the ratio of bad reviews withthe good ones and the ones I have read dont give a good reason to buy this exept the fact that she has a tv show and has been in a couple movies all in all it is a waste of time and money. I gav one star for each ok song on this cd and one for the fact she had enough guts to do this
1,Ugh...,"just look at the cover. you can tell already it has no substance. all she wants is money coming in from two industries at once. and as if it wasn't enough that her acting lacks substance, now she sings about driving around when she doesn't have a license. that kinda signifies that she doesn't feel what she sings... its all for money...just dont even waste your time."
2,Good music bad Vocals,"I like the music but the vocals suck! Hilary has a terriblesinging voice and is really off key when she sings rock.She should really stick to acting. Also, she's trying to hard to look like Avril Lavigne, Believe me don't buy it."
4,A Very Good Debut Album,"Not counting ""I Can't Wait"" and the Lizzie McGuire Movie soundtrack, this is Hilary Duff's first CD, and boy, is it a doozie!I bought this not expecting much, to be honest. I expected mostly ballads and lots of Disney-ish, Kidz Bop-esque music. To my surprise, I was greeted with mostly upbeat songs, well-written lyrics, and great music.""Come Clean,"" ""Workin' It Out,"" ""Party Up,"" and ""Metamorphosis"" are good examples of the best this album has to offer, and hopefully what more will come from Miss Duff in the future. There are a few close misses (""The Math,"" ""Little Voice""), but all in all this is a good album for a debut.I expect only good things from Hilary in the future, and I'm expecting to see more writing credits from her on her sophomore release (her only writing credit in this album was in ""Metamorphosis,"" with the other two H. Duff credits being her sister Haylie's ""Sweet Sixteen"" and ""Inner Strength"")."
4,metamorphosis,"this a cool cd by hillary duff. (I heard itbefore itcame out). the spesalties are so yesterday,the math, and come clean. i heard the planetpremeir on radio disney. im a fan of hillaryduffs and i just saw the lizzy mcguire movielast night.bypelham"
4,Buy Evanascence??!?,"This is, first of all, a teen pop album. I mean I don't remember Hilary declaring that this was pure rock or something. Evanascence is for people older and have you heard the f***ing lyrics? That's totally different music and you can't possibly compare that to Hilary's sort of music I can see that people who just hate Hilary for becoming a success write reviews here. She isn't pure rock. Go buy Linkin Park or something if you like that sort of music. I luv teen pop. If you haven't bought Avril's album (Let go), you should buy that but if you already have it, I don;t see why you shouldn't buy this. It's a great CD!!"
2,YOWZA!!! What a BABE!!!,"I normally don't go for this kind of music, but this chick is so friggin HOT that I ran out and bought it just for the cover photo. Now I listen to it a lot. It's so cute that she thinks she can sing. It's so adorable it makes me want her even more. Maybe some day I can meet her and she'll go out with me. She's so much better looking than that skank Britney or that ho Christina. Man, is Hillary hot, or what? I can't stop thinking about her, wanting her.(...)is what I'd really like to(...)100 stars for her sexiness, 1 star for her musical abilities."
5,BEST CD EVER!,"I dont have the CD, I just borrow my friend's all the time, because this is the best CD in the world! Those who say Hilary Duff cant sing are wrong! My favorite song is ""Come Clean"". I cant wait to buy my own copy! If you dont like Hilary Duff, I think this will change your mind, because it's so great! All the songs are great, and this is worth buying! I could listen to it like, 5 million times and still not get tired of it. Those who dont like it:1. Leave poor Hilary alone. She tries her best, and if her best isn't good enough for you, then just sell her CD and dont buy anymore of them!2. Just because you dont like it, dosent mean other people wont! Dont tell evryone not to buy it, just because you dont like it! Other people might just like it, and if you tell them not to buy it, they wont and maybe miss out on this great CD!People, though I urge you to buy this CD, you dont have to! I am only suggesting that you buy this CD before it's all sold out!"
2,Please....,"This CD is dreadful. I gave her 2 stars only because she can't sing for beans, and somehow she has made her album sell a couple copies to a few tweens. People, we have a magician here. Mabye if she made a magic video she would make more money. Heck, she'd be a billionaire if people paid her NOT to sell her CD. What is the music world coming to? If Hillary Duff can make a CD, what's next?"
4,"The Girl With The Ruby Earring Reviews ""Metamorphosis""","On this CD, the best songs are the up-beat songs. If you like pop songs, this CD is definetly for you. If you liked Hilary's earliest hit, ""I Can't Wait"", I am sure you will enjoy this album. I give this album 4 stars because the slow songs... well... let's just say...YAWN.Songs Worth Listening To:-So Yesterday-Little Voice-The Math-Why Not-Come Clean-Working It Out-Where Did I Go Right?-Inner Strenth (This is a slow song written by Hilary's Sis, Haylie, but it's only about a minute long, so it's worth it)"
4,A Great CD,The Hilary Duff cd is great. I don't see how people can hate her so much. I personally didn't like that kind of music until I heard her sing it. I am a big rap fan. I usually don't listen to anything but rap and r&b but Hilary's cd is an exception.
4,gotta love it,"overall i think this album was very cute. My favorite song was Come Clean. I know that there will be many people against Disney-Channel-star-who-decided-to-become-a-singer Hilary Duff (who i still refer to as Lizzie McGuire). If hilary duff titled her CD metamorphosis then she's obviously ready for people to take her seriously. The album would be even cooler if she wrote most of the songs. Her voice range is kind of only 4 notes but if you're into pop music, you gotta love metamorphosis."
3,Ok,I like her style but personally I think it was a first time oddball. Lets just say a little Babyish.(song titles)1. So yesterday-it keeps repeating its title2. Come Clean-great tune and nice theam3. Workn'it out-great cool meaning4. litle voice-gose on and on and on5. Where did I go right?-BOREING6. Anywhere but here-good and well soft7. The math-rock and roll type8. Love just is-Extreamly Boreing and horible9. Sweet sixteen-ovoral good10. party up-great11. metamorphosis-STUPID AND BORING12. inner strength-Pothetic And way too short13. why not-her biggest hit great
4,whatever,"I am NOT a Hilary Duff fan by any means (she's a very bad actress), but I have to admit, she's an average singer. Lizzie McGuire fans will like this Cd, it's kid apporpriate. I don't know how deep and meaningful the lyrics are, but it's clean."
1,Wierd and Pathetic,I was embarassed in the first place to buy this album..and I was even MORE embarassed when I first listend to it. The girl has a horriable voice and uses no skill. The songs are wierd and make no sense. WASTE OF MONEY dont buy or even download LOL!
4,Please read this review before you but the cd!,"A couple months ago, I hated Hilary Duff. She's a pretty good actress, for the shallow roles she played( I do love her show though...) but she has very little singing talent. ""Why not"" made my quickly change my radio station, it's lyrics barly make sense, they do ryme however, which is the reason most of them are there. And if she wasn't pretty, she probably wouldn't be this big at all. So needless to say, I just about despised her. Well, on aol you can listen to cds before they come out, and hear was Hillary Duff's on my screen. So I clicked, expecting to hear some really bad stuff. The first song is overplayed, so I skipped it. But the rest of the cd wasn't that bad. Sure, it doesn't have deep, meaningful lyrics and her voice is done over, but it wasn't really that bad. It's just a light, fun cd to pop in and dance to. So, from a honest view, all personal feelings aside, it's a pretty good debute album. And it's on my Christmas list!"
1,Worst album ever,Hilary Duff this album is soooo terible. I can't believe how terrible this album is.
4,HILARY COMES VERY CLEAN ON THIS CD!! SHE IS AWESOME!!!,"This girl can act, can sing, and is very Multi-talented. If she was a bad singer as some people are saying, she wouldn't have sold more than 3 million copies to date with her ALBUM. I missed giving her another star only because there are 2 songs that are not my type. The REST ARE REALLY COOL. SHE IS VERY GIFTED YOUNG GIRL. She has a very bright FUTURE ahead!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!You WON""T REGRET BUYING THIS CD."
1,She sux,Come on this is crap. Watch a video of hers and it will show other people's names as the composers!!! What are you people talking about she can't even write her own goddamn music she doesn't play an instrument either so lindsay lohan is more talented.
1,Bleh,I think Hilary Duff is nice lookin and everything but her music and singing is just plain crap. Your better off spending your 15 dollars on a Smashing Pumpkins album.
1,Metamorphis...hmmm,I am sorry..I dont doubt that Hillary has an ok voice..but I dont think she has such a great talent to be making it so big. Hollywood has turned into..ur pretty have a w/e voice but wait your getting famous so even if you dont have the best talent..lets see how much we can do with your fame...cds..movies..etc. I really can't respect a singer unless they write their own songs..or have an great voice like Celin Dion and Mariah Carey. Well I am gonna listen to this cd because I want to see if I am proven wrong by the songs. Maybe the songs will be good enough to see pass her 'ok' voice. I just hope this isnt the start of the next 'britney spears' please we dont need another one of her.
2,Hilary Duff and this cd,"Well, let me just start off to say that this cd has good, catchy songs, but are sung with a girl who's voice is 1/6 computerized and who can't sing. The only reason Hillary Duff is popular is because she is an actress turned singer. Any actress can be a singer. What makes a talented singer is one who isn't famous just because she acts, it is one who has risen from pressures to be a great singer. Hillary Duff's songs are catchy, but she is a really bad singer and an average actor. I recommend this cd to people who just like the songs but not the singing. I also want everyone who reads this to NOT RESPECT HILLARY DUFF AS A SINGER, BUT RESPECT HER AS AN ACTRESS. Thank you"
1,Bad,"Hilary Duff... hmm. Lets see, could she have real talent? Nope. She got signed because of her freekin TV shows and movies. Thats why. She doesn't write any of her songs, she lip-syncs (I had to sit through her ""performance"" at a radio show event and it was so obvious she was lip-syncing that it wasnt even funny), and she has a pretty weak voice. I guess if you like dime-a-dozen pop then you'll like this. But not all pop is bad, some pop bands/groups actually write their material and play their instruments. Try Outkast, Blink-182, or Good Charlotte. You can still save yourselves!"
4,What is the matter with all of you reviewers!?,"Hilary Duff's cd ""Metamorphosis"" has some great songs if this is the type of music you like. Very...Britney Spears (pre-nasty), Christina Aguilera (sweet girl phase), Mandy Moore etc. If that isn't the type of music that you like, then you shouldn't be reviewing this CD and offering advice on it because your opinion is useless to those people interested enough to consider buying it. If you are looking for the sweet, school girl pop music stuff, this cd is great! I have several younger sisters who absolutely love it! And unlike some of the Britney Spears and Christina cds, it doesn't have anything in it that parents might find offensive. Hilary Duff is beautiful, young, and fun. Young girls will love her! There are a couple of really good songs on this CD like ""Why Not"", ""So Yesterday"", and ""Come Clean"". If you like this style, this CD is fun! :)Hope this helps!"
3,Not the best out there,"Ok the songs in this CD arent so bad songs like So Yesterday, Come Clean, Little Voice, Anywhere But Here, Love Just Is and Where did I go right? really stand out as the best but why three stars because Hilary has no talent she cant sing and she cant act,In my opinion Lindsay Lohan and Amanda Bynes are far more talented teen actresses than Hilary is but anyway the only reason this CD went platinum was because Lizzie McGuire fans bought it, the only people that listen to this music are people who liked the Disney Channel Series Lizzie McGuire.and in my opiniom Hilary Duff is just an untalented 16-year-old who calls hereself a popstar"
5,Spooks -- slammin',This group is hot. If and when they release their first full-length album i'll be the first in line to buy it. Great vocals and bass line. Catchy song.
4,World Class Musician,Leif Ove Andsnes is an incredible artist on the piano and his talents are showcased in this cd. His artistry has an extensive range as exhibited in the diversity of this repertoire. This is classical piano at its best.
5,You WILL Break a Sweat!,"The Learn to Dance Salsa Beginner's DVD 3 was excellent. Between keeping the basic step going, rewinding the DVD more times than I care to disclose to grasp each of the new moves and trying to keep time with the music, I worked up quite a sweat. Hey, if you're gonna get in shape it might as well be fun, right?"
5,Great straight,"This works....and I have thin fine frizzy hair.Until you are certain that you like it, I suggest thetravel size"
5,Perfect for Frizzy/Wavy Hair,"My hair dresser recommended this product for me six months ago, and it is the best I have ever used. I pair it with Bumble and Bumble de-frizz and apply a small amount to my hair before blow drying and straightening. It keeps my hair soft and frizzless. One tube lasted me about 6 months."
3,mayday!,"although i hated The Libertines second album (first one was ok), this little ep is a nice slab of their shambolic, messy, upbeat Clash-lite style of punk. the production is unique and full of little audio surprises (which kind of remind me of that underground lo-fi band Beatnik Filmstars), and these songs have a well written and well performed quality. it always amazes me how totally drunk and trashed that The Libertines sound on record. makes me wonder how much a mess it must really be to witness the band live in all their ragged glory. pretty cool."
3,They're OKAY,"These guys aren't going to take a lot of use. Wouldn't recommend them unless you are going to use them for ""VERY LIGHT DUTY"" otherwise forget it.Fast Shipping ThoughPlastic Covers Come Off Real Easy - Too Easy Actually!Don't Recommend You Buy This Product.My Loss - Your Gain - Should you decide NOT to Buy.Shame on you if you do. . ."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP!,"A WOMAN TRYS TO ESCAPE FROM HER ABUSIVE HUSBAND. SO WHAT? THIS MOVIE IS BORING AND THERE'S NOT REALLY NOTHING TO IT. WHY I RENTED THIS MOVIE, I'LL NEVER KNOW. THE ACTING IS AMATEURISH, THE STORY IS POINTLESS, AND THE CHARACTERS HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DEPTH TO THEM WHATSOEVER. MAYBE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE OF THIS MOVIE. BUT WHATEVER THE REASON IS, I FOUND THIS MOVIE TO BE A COMPLETE AND UTTER WASTE OF TIME! AND QUITE FRANKLY, I WOULDN'T BE SUPRISED IF I BEGIN TO SEE SOME OTHER NEGATIVE REVIEWS ON THIS MOVIE ANYTIME SOON."
1,Spectra LTCD 200 Player,Difficult to operate; volume is very low; quality of sound is terrible. I would not recommend this product.
5,Awesome Desserts,There is alot of desserts I would love to try. I am glad I saw this.Caribbean Desserts (Caribbean Cooking Series)
2,mmmmm,"Some nice recipies in it for sauces but in gallons!! who makes a gallon of sauce??lost interest in the recipies, sorry!"
5,"For the family kitchen science ""lite"" experiments","This book, combined with others of like topics from several different countries, has enabled us to not only ""make it as good as 'Our' Grand Mother did"", but as many other Grand Mothers 'did'. This book is a keeper in our culinary library."
5,Desperately Seeking Atman,"Perhaps I'm juvenile. My friend Kris accused me of that when he read this book at my urging years ago. Apparently, all the existential insinuations struck him as much ado about nothing. For my part, I found this one of the funniest books I've ever read. In the age of Jerry Springer, the lampoon of Phil Donahue seems, if anything, tame. He takes the central modern question, ""What does it mean to be ME?"" and spins it into a satirical obsession. (For what it's worth, Kris aside, all my other friends have loved it, too.)"
4,Strong material but smells bad,"I received the product sooner than expected. The jacket's material seems pretty strong and it was easy to put it onto my 85 lbs Catahoula Leopard/Chesapeake Bay Retriever dog mix. My dog seemed to be comfortable wearing it. The only problem I have is that it has a very strong/annoying ""Mothball"" smell. I hung it in my living room to air it out and the entire place stinks now. Other than that, it doesn't seemed to bother my dog."
1,Disappointing,"After Revolutionary Road, Young Hears Crying is a let down. Whereas in Revolutionary Road, Yates was able to penetrate not only the skins but the souls of his characters and unpack his plot in a deliberate and surprising manner, in this book he can only draw sketchy characters who act without rime or reason, who pass by rather than communicate with each other, and who act--if they do-without purpose or motivation. Sad to say, this is a dull and boring book, unfocused and unenlightening. I couldn't finish it.Just a question: Was the alcohol responsible for this failure of vision and commitment?"
1,Cereal Bowl TOO SMALL,"WAY WAY WAY too small. Good for a scoop and 1/2 of ice cream at Best. I have the salad bowls that are wide and shallow and are also no good for serial. This bowl is 6.5"" wide and 2"" tall. Under product details the size indicated is the shipping size."
5,Pet Alien A wonderful laugh,My two Grandson's with laughing out loud at something playing on their television. I stopped to take a look and soon joined in. Pet Alien is a throwback show to animation roots with its great timing and over the top humor. The animation looks just like some of the current hit movies but with a Bugs Bunny take. I have just ordered more titles for their Christamas stockings.
5,The Hulk Rules on DVD,As a fan I've been waiting YEARS for this series to FINALLY come to DVD in Season Sets. And there are alot of Episodes in this AWESOME set that I haven't seen UNCUT since the 1970's. Oh I had Earthquakes Happen a couple of Years ago on VHS from Goodtimes Video. That I found at my local K-Mart. But the picture Quality was so crappy. To my fellow Hulk Fans let's send the sales of this DVD through the ROOF.
3,The Incredible Hulk Returns!,"When you play this DVD you will find that the title is in fact, The Incredible Hulk Returns, not the Return of the Incredible Hulk. It was a made for TV movie. Bill Bixby is David Banner as he was in the TV series. This story also introduces Thor, the Thunder God, and his earthly counterpart, but the introduction was badly written. Breaking into Dr Banner's lab just as he is about to cure himself from turning into the Hulk and stopping the machines just to tell Dr Banner about how he is able to summon Thor doesn't make sense. There are no extras on this bargain basement DVD, and my copy had some glitches in the encoding when it tried to play the closing credits. This DVD is mainly for the fans of the TV series as it doesn't have much else going for it."
1,Awful return of a great show,"I'll be brief. I LOVED the Hulk in all his iterations. The comic, and the original run of the series, heck I even give the cartoon on Saturday morning credit.HOWEVER, this movie [garbage].Using the Hulk to push this spin-off vehicle for Marvel's Thor was a terrible idea and totally ran against the grain of what was a decent sci-fi drama TV series, even with the token appearance of Jack McGee.The subsequent Daredevil idea in the ""Trial of The Incredible Hulk"" was equally weak.Only in the third movie, ""Death of the Incredible Hulk"" did they come even close to the flavor of the original series.I would say only the most hardcore fan with blinders on could really appreciate this movie."
5,Very good,The Incredible Hulk season 1 is exelent. Worth watching and a good investment. I cant wait for the other seasons to come out. This item is worth getting.
1,Bad product period.,"This was the TV movie with Thor, not the second TV movie of the original series. But both movies were awful. You would have to be insane to like any of this campy trash."
4,Green is good,"It's fantastic to finally see this television show as a Season 1 release. So many other older shows are getting their release on boxed sets and it's about time for The Incredible Hulk show as well. Also, the television shows that are still enjoying new seasons today have their shows in boxed sets already-- they don't have to wait many years to be released like the shows of yesterday. Yes, I may be a little bit disatisfied with having already bought the ultimate collection, but the cost for this set is adequately priced. I'm not going to complain."
4,adorable :),"light, intricate, and very cute! They came very quickly, and the price was very fair! I have a second piercing in my left ear and I like to wear one there so along with my other jewelry I always have a fairy whispering in my ear :)"
2,Brand Name!,"When I checked online .... this looks very nice, good price etc..... I can trust CASIO company and so, I ordered few watches. When I got it in hand, I saw the strap is very thin and it is hard to present to man. Only boys..... so, I recommend this watch if you are presenting this to boys. Price, Brand name is good. Cannot present to ""MAN""s.But I love the design & looks really good."
1,Extremely difficult to read time (hands can't be seen),"Extremely difficult to read time (hands can't be seen) caused by the light reflection of the mineral glass/plastic. I have collected low-priced Casio watches and others. The design of the watch is elegant, but not worth the money, even it is cheap."
4,ok,okay watch for the cost. Mineral crystal scratches pretty easily but for 16 dollars not really too much of an issue. only a button to change the hands rather then a crown so it is pretty annoying to set the watch.
4,Value for Money,"A very nice product for the money paid. Dual time very cool. A bit too small for a man, but the dual effect is very cool. Will be alos cool in silver or gold."
3,Beautiful but invisable,"A great looking and affordable nerd chic watch which is nearly invisible in less-than-bright conditions! The face is just not legible in low light, the digital display is not backlit, and there is no glow in the dark markings."
2,Left out the most important things...,"Siminoff treats the reader of this work like a neighbor who might compete with you in a pie bake off. He lets you taste his work, but when it come to showing how its done... REALLY showing how its done... he treats you to a shoulder shrug and incomplete instructions. Its like that neighbor who is willing to share a recipe but who leaves out one important spice!Really, this was a surprise because at least one of his other works was excellant. The problem is, he shows how some things are accomplished but leaves out completely how to build the jigs and framework to get started.This is truly one of the most annoying books on luthiery I have ever read and would ask for my money back except I have (inadvertantly) damaged it.He really needs to read up and study how some of the other teachers have helped others with their projects."
3,A great Book.,"This book is mostly about a prince and a whipping boy.A whipping boy is a boy that gets whipped for the prince's trouble.When the prince decides to runaway he wants the whipping boy to come with.Theyrun into some cutthroats,and then the boy and the prince run off.But the cutthroats find them,and the prince gets whipped, and thats my favorite part."
2,A book about changing your ways for the best.,I read the book the Whipping Boy by Sid Fleischman.This book is about a prince and his whipping boy.Together they run away. Along this adventure filled journey the prince learns an important lesson. What adventures do they face? What was the important lesson? Read this book to find the answers to these questions.
3,A book about two boys that eventually beome friends.,"Hi!I read a book called ""The Whipping Boy,"" by Sid Fleishchman.Do you like a book with humor and suspense,well than this is a book for you!This is a book for 3rd to 4th graders to read and enjoy.This book is about Prince Horace better known as Prince Brat and his own whipping boy named Jemmy.In this book they encounter close calls when they runaway from the castle.I can't tell you what happens at the end,so you will have to read the book to find out.I liked this book because it deals with some real problems and makes you think more about people who are poorer than you are.So the next time you want to read a good novel,go and get ""The Whipping Boys!"""
4,A bumpy but fun ride,"I have read many books. This would be number 15 on my top thirty book list. It is a good book for first and second graders to read and enjoy well also building vocabulary. I think that Prince Brat and Jemmy are fine characters. But, nothing really happens with Hold-your-nose Billy and Cutwater. There are events that happen that don't really matter like the lady who lost her bear. Other than that it is a great book. I enjoyed it."
4,A book about a prince and his whipping boy.,"Hi,I read the book The Whipping Boy by Sid Fleishman. It is about a prince. Prince Horace (also known as Prince Brat)and an orphan who is Prince Brat's whipping boy named Jemmy. Whenever Prince Brat does something wrong Jemmy gets whipped for it. I think this is a good book because it tells you that if you're nice to others you will make more friends. I think this book is for 4th-7th graders. You should read this book and find out the rest!"
3,I think that the Whippingboy book is a good book.,"PrinceBrat gets whipped by HoldYourNoiseBilly,that made me very happy because Prince Brat finally got whipped. The Whipping Boy book is a very good book if you get a chance to read, please read the Whipping Boy."
4,Interactions with a gang of furry individuals.,"Grace Spruch and her husband Larry, both physics professors, moved into a Greenwich Village apartment in 1970. For ten years Grace kept a journal of the observations she made about the squirrels that visited them for daily handouts of nuts. Looking for a book with drama, romance, suspense, and excitement? Look elsewhere. But if you want to read a wonderful account of a rodent-loving woman's interactions with a charming gang of furry individuals, check this book out."
2,Your results may vary,"I notice that the other reviews of this book are all over the map. That distribution of opinion matches my own feelings. I found the first part of this book delightful and informative, as good as the author's previous book Mathematics: The Science of Patterns. The last part I found unreadable. Goodbye Descartes begins with a persuasive argument that intelligence is not computation and ends up speculating on what intelligence DOES involve. The latter is admittedly a next to impossible task, but the author's attempt to combine logic and sociology to form ""soft mathematics"" left me unimpressed. Overall, a disappointment."
3,"Wasn't too bad, wasn't so good","First, let the readers beware: this book is not about Descartes. Decartes stands on the fine line between the mechanical viewpoint and traditional ideas of soul, vortices, and light travels faster in media. The author is not happy about the mechanical viewpoint. Logic is indeed simplistic. There seem no place for ""quality"" or semantics in logic. But if logic can't do it, what other alternatives do we have? Like Marvin Minsky once remarked, if a thinking process cannot be reduced to something simplistic (like turning on and off the switchboard), the whole situation would be pretty much like a dwarf in the chess-playing machine. The book was easy-to-read and full of energy. However, I had to ask, ""so what?""."
3,Nice big pictures but many not from Hubble. Text is skimpy.,"With the title containing Hubble and Origins, I was hoping for lots of new information about what the latest data from Hubble ST would reveal about our origins. Instead the book is a compendium of very nice large format color photos of galaxies stars and the planets in our Solar system, accompanied by one paragraph captions - and a lot of white space where more information and analysis of ""origins"" could have been. I recommend this book for coffee table perusal, not for the serious reader of cosmology. Sidney Sheres"
1,Bad Experience!,"The DVD Writer didn't work. It had no instruction. The return will cost me half of the price for shipping & Handling, return postage and insurance. I will not buy form Tiger Direct Again."
5,A Must for Air Racing Fans,"""Benny Howard & Harold Neumann Sweep the 1935 National Air Races"" promises much...and delivers on all counts. If the Golden Era of Air Racing is your passion, the depth and breathe of knowledge will fascinate you. If you're new to the subject, the many photos and news reel footage and expert commentary will convey the excitement, danger and passion of the pilots and their planes. Well done!Benny Howard & Harold Neumann Sweep the 1935 National Air Races"
2,Adam of the Road,"Adam of the Road is a fairly hard to follow book. It's about a boy named Adam who lives in medieval times. Later in the book he loses his dog Nick and has to search for him. I didn't like it that well because I couldn't become attached to the characters and it was hard to read. If you like books that are set in medieval times and adventurous, you'll like this book."
4,Adam of the Road,"This book Adam of the Road is a very intersting book. I liked how it could put the characters and the scenes in your head and make it seem like it's really happening. The only thing I didn't like was the names of the characters,they were wierd. I would really recomend this book to my friend because she likes to read books that take place in the past."
2,11 yr old's view point,"I think that this book was kind of good at some parts and kind of slow in other parts.[I like exciting books].There were two exciting parts that I was on the edge of my seat but all the other parts gave me a headache. Some parts are just too descriptive and some parts you could just take out of the story and you woudn't even notice that it was gone. But if you like slow books, this is the kind of book you would want to read. But I do not recomend this book for readers that like high adventure and such."
4,a very compelling noval,"Adam of the road offers a spectacular insight into the life of a traveling musitian in the late castle age. It spins an envirement so realistic that one can almost believe that the auther has been there and seen it. The plot is sound, develeping completely before the climax and the conclusion ending very solidly. I personaly think that if one would like to read a book and learn somthing in the process this is the right book for them. This book is like a fibanache number for the imagenation."
1,Warning: Severe Choking Hazard!,"Twinlab manufactures excellent health/bodybuilding supplements but these aminos are just WAY too large to be considered safe. I would not recommend these horse-pills to anyone. I do take Twinlab amino acid tablets but only the ""Amino 1000"" variety since they are much smaller than the ""Amino 2000"" variety. Ralph Nader could write a book about these pills. WARNING: SEVERE CHOKING HAZARD!!!"
2,Ice Age--The Let Down.,"I found this movie more of a let down. The weak premise of the first movie (Jungle Book on Ice without the good jokes, songs or dialogue) is stretched even thinner in the sequel. Sequels in this genre are always going to be compared toToy Story 2 (Two-Disc Special Edition)"". The producers should have realized that the script they had was not good enough. They obviously did not want to invest any more money as no new characters are introduced (i don't count a scaled model of one of the original characters with longer hair and slightly different color as new). So it clearly shows their intention to cash-in quickly on any good will.The one saving grace for this movie is the squirrel short done to different thematic sound effects (my kids seemed to enjoy this). that's why it gets 1 extra star.my advice is if you really want to own it (and trust me you don't), buy a used copy."
2,It took my video-adict 3-year-old 3 tries to watch it through,"The reviewers who were tepid in their praise of this movie were being generous. Scrat was the only watchable charactor, and that was mostly in the ""extra"" short further down the menu. Lame sequels are not limited to live-action films."
2,Ice Age 2,"Ice Age 2 was not as good as the first one, but it was still worth going to see. Diego is my favorite, but I felt he didn`t have much to say or much of a part. I`m glad that Scrat had a longer part in this one though, he stole the show! The plot was OK, and it deffinetly wasn`t as funny as the first one. If you liked the first one alot, go see Ice Age 2, you`ll probably enjoy it."
4,It's O.K.,"I didn't like this as much as Ice Age, But my grandsons think it is as good so I gave 4 stars. Great for the children and good for us older folks as well."
5,Fantastic Performance!,"If you are looking for a vacuum cleaner that will clean up everything in your house, in your garage or in your car look no further. The 6.25hp motor on this Shop Vac will not disappoint. In addition to it's poweful motor and suction, this Shop Vac comes with a great assortment of cleaning tools and an extra hose. I highly recommend it to anyone intersted in purchasing a wet/dry vac."
4,Simple to use and clean.,"Purchased this to go with my little shop-vac. It works well and cleans up. There really is no frills with this product, but I wish I could give the product a one star only because it should come with the shop-vac at time of its purchase. So... I'll give it a four star."
5,Right size shop vac filters,I have not used the new ones yet but they seem to be the size that I needed. I looked at everyone else's review first.
2,Shopvac papers,What I and my husband did not realize is that you must have the foam insert as well to make this product work. It was a low enough price that we chose not to return the item.
3,Warm and bulky!,"It is quiet, warm, and bulky! Plenty of pockets. it is not a long fit and it rides up. It would be exceptable if I was not bow hunting."
3,"Appears Attractive and functional, need correct washers","Tried a few times to install without leaking. I have a standard ordinary faucet but still needed to hunt for better sized washers. For a few pennies, a greater selection of washers could have been included. It's the little things that become an annoyance and eat time. After 2 months , it still sits uninstalled."
1,I would love to review this book...,... if it were delivered. Don't waste your time odering this book here... It takes too long to be delivered. You will grow old before you ever read it.
4,"Great tool, flinky handle cover.",I'm a tall guy and love the extra long handle. The working angle of the tool is great and it easily breaks up hard soil. The tine end is nice and small and works well around obstacles. The only minor issue I've had is the plastic cover at the top of the handle comes off when I'm working. It slips right back on but it's irritating. The weight and balance is great. I'd definitely recommend it. I may try a dab of hot glue to keep the handle cover from slipping.
5,unique collection,"no need to skip tracks, pop it in and let it play,great car cd, remastering is excellent. Classic cover photo. Nice set,buy it."
4,Good book,The book was very helpful in teaching me how to write philosophy papers. It had great detail and I would recomend this book to others who need a little help like I did.
1,Did not fit filter,purchased this to put around the filter I purchased. When I attempted to put it on the filter the foam began ripping at the seam and as I tried to carefully continue it ripped right in half. Either the sleeve was manufactured incorrectly or it was not the correct one for the product I purchased (90304).
2,Not as advertised,"This ""sleeve"" is advertised as being able to be put in place of a filter. It really just goes over an existing filter, and looks nothing like the picture shown. A little more clarity would be nice."
3,Swing Arm for TV,"This product is just okay, somewhat difficult to assemble and it actually is very heavy. Not sure I would buy it again, I think there are better products on the market."
1,Size Matters!,"Caution! These hoses are only 5 feet long (60 inches) not 6 feet as stated, and didn't work for my location. The item number on the package I received was 2PK60-1212."
3,Your basic functions watch,"I bought this since the strap on my old timex broke. It works well, and is fairly easy to understand. Nothing special. I particularly like that you can adjust settings either upwards or downwards, meaning you don't have to cycle through 59 minutes to go back one minute."
5,Unbelievable,"This is by far the best DVD ever made. Pre-Concert footage, a full concert, music videos, multi-angle shots of a few songs, and there are a few solos by Sid (DJ) and Joey (drums) that are out of this world. Maybe I'm biased because I'm a gigantic Slipknot freak - but this 2 DVD set is unbelievable. The performance of Spit it Out is cool as hell, and if you've ever seen Slipknot in concert before (which I had) you'll realize how real this DVD is - it's exactly like being at the show! The sound quality is amazing. The only thing bad I can say about this is I wish they taped in in Denver instead of London so I could have been there for the taping. BUY THIS DVD NOW!!!!!"
5,Nice !!,Perfect DVD. One of the best concerts ever. You will enjoy this DVD. You wont regret. It comes with an angles edit.
5,You won't be disappointed in this one,"I was pleasantly surprised when I received my order, not only did I get it very fast but the costume was very nice. The fringe detail on it was great, very authentic looking. Unfortunately two days before I saw this costume I had ordered another one from another company, and I was so disappointed in it, so when I saw this one I was hesitant to order it thinking it would not look good either, but I'm really glad I did order it because it's great, my son will look wonderful in his play next week! Thank you Nancy"
5,A legacy of his greatness.,"Now that he is gone, this collection will help keep him around despite that fact. I have watched it several times, and shared it with numerous friends. No matter how many times I watch it, I laugh all over again, enjoying it as much as the first time I saw it. But even with this set, I can't get enough. I hope there will be additional footage released to add to this collection. There is so much material available, I hope many more sets will be released. He will be truly missed. God bless Johnny Carson."
3,Doomsday Gun -- very entertaining and even interesting -- but historically accurate?,"As an engineer, I always liked this B movie -- as entertainment. I can't vouch for the historical accuracy. As an engineer, however, I have to question the strategic value of a gun that can only point in one direction, which would then require a maneuverable projectile to attack off-aim targets. Patton purportedly commented that fixed fortifications are monuments to the stupidity of man (or something like that). Of course, that was Iraq's problem, not the movie-maker's.If you are technically inclined, there is an amusing aspect to this movie. I find it hilarious what movie-makers think engineers do with computers and how computers are used to make design decisions. You just have to watch the movie."
1,useless!!,being a deadhead for many years i find this book to be useless and borderline silly. who cares what one lady who became a deadhead in 86' has to say and tries to figure out.if you want to learn about deadheads then read A LONG STRANGE TRIP or the many others available!!
5,Indispensable!,"The 5 inch Vise Grips with wire cutter are an absolute necessity. Locking pliers that are small enough to fit in a pocket, and with wire cutters that will go through disproportionately large stuff.These work as a small clamp, rivet tighteners, a handle extension, cutters for anything short of the hardest tempered wire, as well as first rate pliers. The jaw capacity is a little small, but excellent for a tool this small.These have a permanent place in my basic tool kit.E. M. Van Court"
3,Not quite as good as I'd hoped,"I looked forward to seeing this film after all the positive things I'd heard about it. And it was generally satisfying. I do admire Egoyan's ""objective"" camera, screenplay and resistance to manipulation of the audience. But at the heart of it there is a certain coldness and clinical quality that makes the film ""a tale well told"", but curiously unaffecting. This detachment makes it feel ""all head and no heart"". Still, well worth a look."
1,Truly awful--would like two hours of my life back,"God! What an awful movie!This movie had absolutely no point. After seeing it I couldn't figure out for the life of me WHY anyone had made it, and who would like it. Lots of very drawn out scenes with long periods of silence between dialog, and nothing made sense--the daughter making out with her dad? The lawyer trying to get rich off of the townspeople? No redeeming qualities WHATSOEVER! The worst movie I've ever seen, second only to _What Dreams May Come_ (and no, I am not an insensitive lout who doesn't like thoughtful movies. This one just had no point, made no sense, and bored me to tears!)I'd give this one zero stars if such a thing were within my power. I didn't just feel apathetic about it--I hated it. Worthless."
3,What's This?,"Again I hit the right mouse button unexpectedly. Am I the kid viewing the emperor's new clothes? I really liked the continuous retelling of the Pied Piper of Hamlin, but I just didn't get this film. Does anyone understand it? Whew, there's so much posing as art. and this movie must need an electron microscope to delve into its mysteries, because it's as understandable as a quark. Atom Egoyan is a ""filmmaker"", whereas people like Spielberg, George Lucas, Billy Wilder, Orson Welles, etc. just made movies. This is a bore."
2,"overrated, boring","i rented this film because i had heard good things about it (and the 'spine-lines' on the box claimed it was good)...but it was a big boring disappointment. you definitely won't miss anything, and will save precious time if you skip this bust."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Overpraised in many quarters, The Sweet Hereafter is a well-crafted look into the lives of people who have had their lives racked by tragedy, but its clinical detachment and an unnecessary incest subplot prevent Egoyan's film from achieving greatness."
2,"LOVE this book, HATE this edition",I LOVE this book and its quirky story line. I found a copy of it on my cousin's bookshelf while I was visiting her this summer in France. Her copy was hardbound with excellent subtle coloring printing.The book I received from Amazon (the English version) was a huge disappointment. The colors are very harsh and the printing is awful in comparison to the original French version.I'll be returning my copy to Amazon and be tracking down a French version.
1,Not suitable for younger kids,"This book may be clever and amusing for adults (teens?), but is really isn't appropriate for the Juvenile section of the library. It is more disturbing than you would expect from the cute cover and drawings."
3,Code Name God,I read this book for a discussion with my Book Club. I would not have read it otherwise. I sympathise with the topic and the caracters but I did not enjoy the book. I was enlightened about the problems Mr Ghaumik had but I would not reccomend it. I am grateful for his genius and the difference it has made in delecate surgery if I ever need it.
3,Why am I tired?,"I agree that some very helpful information is given here, but for the 2nd (or third) time I find it tiring to try to get through the whole book. Why can't I finish this dang thing?"
5,Everyone needs to read this book,"What an amazing piece of work, I was in a book store today and I saw that this book is still on the shelves and it just reminded me how this book had changed my life about three years ago.She teaches you techniques how to accept things so that in essence you are no longer bothered by them, and indeed after reading this book I felt way happier when I applied the principles that she outlined.I am so thankful for the author who wrote this amazing piece of work and I will be rereading this book as soon as possible."
4,A suprisingly good thriller,"I love when I am not expecting too much from a movie and get much more. A thriller from start to finish. The fish effects are very good and well and some of the things that happen with them are amazing. A very pleasant suprise, highly recommended."
5,FRANKENFUN,"Surprise, surprise! This movie was surpassed my expectations. Although a low budget B movie, it looks and feels quite good for a movie of this genre. The special effects are way above average and the director mounts some suspenseful let's wait to see who gets killed next scenes, and there are some surprises in that, too! The director also avoided the standard bayou cliches, and even with stock type characters, there were some interesting nuances that made them original. Troy Kittles made a nice Denzel-like hero; and the woman who played the voodoo lady was smartly modern, and her voodoo was underplayed.This is a very good giant monster movie, and I liked it very much."
4,Gets the job done,"What can you say, it does what it's supposed to. Pour the chalk in and work it around a little and start making lines. Cranks fine, fills fine, metal tab hooks over nails or the edge of a 2x4. Nothing exceptional - you get what you pay for."
1,Don't watch it,This video was a REAL dissapointment. The entire movie looks like a vacation video of someone who had to much rum. What a waste of money.
4,good stuff,"This dvd is good, but I would have preferred a few more songs. The performance of the band is good, but the audience was too small , and did not seem to be exceptionallly energetic.To the reviewers in Barbados, this is not Jazz, so dont expect to hear trumpets like those from heaven. This is reggae, so the horn men will only come on periodically.Thats enough.Any true steel pulse fan should have this dvd. It should be more energetic, but it has good clean audio, and video.Good reggae music from a legendary band. They dont make them any more, so get this dvd."
4,Just a glance,"If you wanted a basic idea of what social workers do and their motivation this is an excellent book to have. I am leaning toward the career and I could see myself in the eyes of the writers, as they address the social issues of our time. This is just a glance, but a good book to get a kick start."
4,Don't pay more than $25,"This is $25 everywhere, don't pay more! Like the product and would buy again. If you want this spray don't buy it here unless it is priced at $25 or less."
2,Didn't do much for me....,This product was a very big disappointment and waste of money. I have almost completely straight hair and was hoping this spray would give me somewhat beachy waves and a little body. But once I spray it on my hair it just weighs down the curls and makes my hair stiff and stringy. It's basically a hair spray more than a wave enhancer. I think this product is more suited for those who already have waves in their hair. Other sprays that I have bought for less than five dollars worked better.
2,Great choice of Christmas songs but sounds like vinyl record,"I really liked the selection of songs chosen for this CD. Since there aren't any vocals on this recording, the music is very relaxing and soothing. However, the CD must have been made from a now-extinct album because you can hear the needle on the vinyl which is very distracting."
5,Soulful,"Lauren's Album goes deep into your soul, especially for a woman or really anyone whose been in love, hurt in love or misunderstood in love. She knows exactly how a woman feels and she's said it all."
1,waist of money,"I purchased this product specifically for designing business cards and brochures. It has had endless problems. The designs were great however there was a problem with printing the business cards. The company has a downloadable file to fix this but you have to go into your hard drive to replace the bad file, which I haven't a clue how to do. I'm not that tech. savvy. I had a problem with saving things in pdf. The file saves but then opens a blank page. The company has not addressed this issue. Currently, after only three days of having this, the program won't even open. I just get a bunch of Error windows. I have followed the companies instructions to uninstall and reistall with the same problems occuring. This software does have a money back guarantee. Good thing."
5,How to be a real man...,"This my favorite book ever. I first read this when I was 11, and I might've read this about 30-40 times. This book has helped me to go through tough times and always has been an inspiration. After my book got lost, I painstakingly found the same edition I always loved. This is a must read. As an admirer of Soviet literature, I believe this is one of the best books of post WWII era."
2,An exercise in propaganda,"Written in the transition from Clinton to Bush, Olasky does here what Olasky does best: puff political conservatism in the name of religious conservatism. Andrew Jackson is a Christian hero. Abraham Lincoln is a deistic big government guru who happened to win a war. Bill Clinton is an unChristian fake. If you are a World magazine subscriber, you'll love this book as it is editorializing with a thin veneer of history. There are, though, even among conservative thinkers, much better books to study."
5,Beautiful!,This was such a wonderful story. It made me so happy. The spinster finds confidence in herself and the scoundrel finds marriage to be a good thing. I related with Amanda so much. This is definitely one of Kleypas's best ever.
3,Ok Storyline,Ms. Kleypas is consistent with her storylines. They are somewhat far fetched and unlikely but still an ok read. I give her high marks for sensuality - she's very good in that department.
2,Looked promising - A disappointment,"I had been reading some of the reviews about this book and when i saw it at my bookstore, i bought it.The first few chapters very very promising and i thought this will be an excellent read. But as i read the book, somewhere along the plot i started getting bored and losing interest.I don't discredit Lisa's sizzling sex scenes but i feel that this book revolved too much around sex, sex and more sex.What began as a good story plot turned out to be very disappointing.I don't recommend this book the LK fans.My friend asked me how i felt about the book and my reply was, ""the book is a sex manual which describes different methods to sexual positions."""
5,Fantastic!,Amanda Briars is about to turn 30. She gets herself an unusual birthday gift--a man. She has decided to buy herself a man for the night of her birthday. She falls under the spell of the man that shows up only to find out later that he is Jack Devlin--a very successful publisher who wants her working for him! Amanda is faced with the decision of whether or not to work for the man she despises yet is attracted to.Suddenly You is a fantastic read. It has very likable characters in it who aren't the usual rich nobility of London. The characters in this book are authors and publishers and the like. The story moves along at a nice fast pace leaving the reader no time at all to become bored. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this book.This was my first book by this author but I'm sure not the last. This is a great book that could possibly be read in one setting--it is that good and that enjoyable. A very pleasurable read to be read again and again.
5,Great book.,I have read many books and enjoyed them. This book has a different story line which was refreshing to read.
4,Truly entertaining,It is a wonderfully entertaining book. I really loved the why the author describes Nora and her personality. You don't really know until the last moment if she's truly mad or truly misfortunate.Another mind blowing portrait is that of Einstein the dog. It is so well depicted that you fall in love with the damn animal. Truly en emblematic figure.The action is also well paced and entertaining and the dilemma in the core of the story is both touching and realistic.A good novelThe Raven Legacy
5,New Book For School,"The book I got is pretty good. It's in awesome condition :) I'm really glad I bought it, even though it was only for school."
5,Captivating throughout,4th time I've read it ans sure I will do so again. Highly recommend everyone who see it to read it
4,Was a good book. Would Gladly Read it Again,I picked up this book mildly interested in the summary on the back. I tried twice to read it but got bored and set it down. The 3rd time I started to read it I stuck with it and liked it a lot. I think this is a really good book and I recomend it to anyone. The only thing is that I found it a little hard to get into at first but once you do you won't be able to put it down!
2,Big Dissapointment,"Upon coming on this book I was searching goodreads for the best ranked horror novel. Unfortunately for me once I start reading a book I can't stop reading it. I would really like to know what was so appealing about this book. That being said I am not particular to genre novels. There is really nothing special about this book except for cliche type scenes and settings, characters, and dramatic effects that are supposed to elicit response. If you actually enjoy literature stay away from this book."
3,For dog lovers,"This is the first Dean Koontz book I have read - I would say it was OK, you will enjoy it much more if you are a dog lover. I read this because I knew Dean Koontz is a very popular writer & I wanted to read something scary. This to me was not scary - humourous yes and somewhat entertaining but mostly a light read."
4,Doesn't get much better than this!!,"REPOST of an earlier review I did accidentally under my wife's name/account...she didn't enjoy it as much as I did because it was TOO suspenseful for her (can't cover your eyes like when watching a movie). :-)Now that there is about 250 reviews already with an average rating of 5 stars I hesitate to even leave a review because so much has already been said. Plain and simple...one of the best, most exciting, page-turning books I've ever read. The suspense at times was too much to bear and I had to put it down, relax, then come back too it. One of my all time favorite books!!**UPDATE**I recently re-read this short review and got excited. so I went back and re-read the book.I didn't like it as much for the relational interaction between the male and female protagonists, but the suspense still held it's own years later. It was a good read but no longer my favorite Koontz book, so I knocked it down from 5-star to 4-star.Still worth a read though!!"
2,Disappointing,"Koontz has done a lot better. I'd recommend ""The Bad Place"" or ""Hideaway"" as examples of his best horror writing."
2,This would fail a creative writing class.,"Maybe I don't have the same youthful imagination I had in my younger years, and call me a no-fun-nelly, but the idea of a dog that wags its tail when it wants to say yes and bark when it wants to say no is just not all that inventive to me. Put a killer baboon into this mix, and you pretty much have the premise to the Watchers. Yes I'm being serious.If this thoughtful plot wasn't enough to keep you engaged, then surely the Shakesperianesque communications will seize your attention, as this completely random portion of the book will demonstrate:""Cake and Pie,"" one of the young men said.""Cake and Pie,"" the other echoed.Nora frowned, not understanding.""Piece of cake,"" one of them explained.""Easy as pie,"" the other said.""Cake and pie,"" Nora said, nodding.For all the comments that are sure to attach to this review, keep in mind, YES I do think I can do better, and hopefully one day I will.~ActionSam"
4,Not plausible? HOW can you be sure?,"This is one of the first books I read by Koontz. He's a genius!Watchers has all the elements of a good story. It's fast moving, very suspenseful, truly romantic, and filled with adventure. One almost literally cannot put it down.Many say this story is not plausible. People once believed the world was flat, too. How can we be sure?"
3,Can believe all these 5 stars,"Dean Koontz is my favourite author. I'd heard a lot about this novel and looked forward to reding it. I have to say I was very dissapointed. The story is so silly. The thing I like most about Koontzs books is that they could happen. Not this one! An intelligent dog and a big ugly monster - its so stupid. I did not find any suspense in it at all. I just gave it 3 stars because I love Koontz and I don't want to affect the average 5 star rating the book got here. My top five DK books are: 1. Strangers 2. Phantoms 3. Whispers 4. The voice of the night 5. Intensity/Servants of twilightBy the way, the two snow books are in my opinion awful as well."
3,"Mostly a Good Read, though Implausible","This is the 2nd of 5 books I will ever read by Koontz. I think I've read about enough by him, now.There are some good characters, including the dog, Einstein. The villain is despicable. It turns my stomach to read what he does to people, and it is a shame that Koontz puts some sick ideas out there for people.I found it odd that Koontz seems to dwell on this concept of animals (dogs, actually) being trained to be thinking beings. By chance, I first read FEAR NOTHING, and then this book second. I'm surprised he gets so mileage out of that idea!"
5,Super Dog & Nice Couple against the Terrible Mutant.,"""Watchers"" is a great story to be read.Dean Koontz has a superlative genius for depicting scenes with constant and subtle increase of tension. The author with very tiny elements turns a normal engagement, into a hair-raising situation.The dog-human relationship is very dearly depicted and shows Koontz's deep penetration into canine psyche. Every dog-lover person will be seduced by the mutated Golden Retriever that's righteously named ""Einstein"".Even the hideous ""Outsider"" has its own attractive traits.It looks like every reader will be satisfied as the book contains romance, horror, adventure, fantasy, thrill, monster, wonder-dog, psycho-killer, dogged cop, whatever. The whole story is very neatly tied up and keep you running chapter after chapter until the end.It is a book that may be enjoyed by thrillers fans and general public too.Reviewed by Max Yofre."
5,THE BEST DEAN HAS WRITTEN (AND THAT I HAVE READ),"This is the book that got me reading again. I just could not put it down until i had finished it. A friend actually lent it to me so when i returned it to him, i had to go out and buy my own personal copy. This is dean's finest work and i have converted many a reader to him through lending it to them."
5,I waited so long for a book like this,I am an avid runner and have been plagued with injuries. After reading the book I learned that I have been stretching wrong and not working out my legs and back correctly. I have been starving for information like this for so long. I have spoken to so many of my friends who are active also and they love the book. It is so important to understand our bodies. I feel confident that this book will help my running in the future. I have recommended this book to everyone.
1,"Too many topics, not enough detail on any","I'm returning this book today. I did not think it was at all as described. It is a book that lists many sports and the problems associated with them. The problem is that she covers so many areas that there is not much detail in any of them. If you have spent any time at all in your sport, you will already know all of the information. For example, she covers scuba diving. If you have your scuba certification, you had to know all of the information to pass the test anyway! I was looking for a good book on the general injuries that women athletes frequently encounter and this was not it. I currently have an injury that I think can be one of two common injuries and neither one of them was addressed in the book."
4,Black super heroes in all their glory!!!!,"Sweet Christmas - it sure is great to see Luke Cage teaming up with the Black Panther. How does Reginald Hudlin, a.k.a. Entertainment President of Black Entertainment Television, find the time to write such a thought provoking title?? His Black Panther is noble, powerful and super rich. I loved the interplay between Cage & T'challa as well as the dialogue. I also loved seeing all the black super heroes teaming up like Blade, Brother Voodoo, Photon, The Falcon, etc. I sure hope the Black Panther movie is made with Hudlin and Wesley Snipes in the title role. All the characters in this book are Bad Muthas and I say that in a good way!!"
1,Didn't do much to my hair,"I have short salt and pepper hair. Gray hair is very dry and unruly. I have tried tons of stuff and nothing really works.I came across this product and the reviews were great. This stuff is not cheap so I thought it must be good.I have tried for about two months and my hair is exactly as before, unruly and very dry. I am very disappointed.Not recommend it at all.I wish I had my money back."
3,Does Smooth the Hair Down,"I bought this product based on the reviews here. I find it does what it says it will. It smooths down the frizz and does add some shine. However, it does not work miracles. My hair is blonde and damaged by hi-lighting, so I realize I need a deep conditioner. This serum cannot provide that. I was hoping it would, so my disappointment is that it does not really soak into the hair and deeply condition, but it doesn't really say that it will. So I still use the product in styling and it is a decent product."
4,"Back to Bach, Please.","I wasn't as over-joyed with this CD as I expected to be. I bought it after hearing the title track on FM radio. The title track is, indeed, a jewel; the rest is, in my view, only high-grade ""background"" music.The pianist is a marvel (and a beauty, too!) - her popularity is easily understandable. She possesses a remarkable gift for transposing and transcribing classic keyboard to ""swing"" keyboard. Many Bach purists (this one, for example) don't appreciate that, even though we have to admit that a lot of Bach swings, anyway, without transcribing. Lsten to tracks 3 and 4 and you will get your money's worth - they're worth the price."
3,"not bad, could be better","Got this knife on sale at a discount store. This is what I've learned about it since picking it up.The pro's-the knife has dual thumb studs, so if you are left handed or ambidextrous you might find this knife helpful among all the other right hand only knifes taking up space on the shelf.-This knife can be quick to draw, you can just flick it open if you put the right amount of force behind it. Might be a nice change of pace if you hate pushing the knife back until it locks open.The con's-The handle is made of aluminum, which makes the palms of your hands easier to sweat and could slide out of your hands if not careful.-Looks sharp but it isn't, you'll need to do that yourself or get someone to do it for you.Overall ReviewPretty much the only thing that saves this knife is the dual stud feature which opens the diversity pool of buyers. This is a better than nothing folding knife, if you want/need it than go for it, but there are better knifes out there."
2,Too old to please.,I bought this DVD because I like O'Brien and Ward Bond from their movies they did for John Ford. I had to find out that they needed Ford. To make a short story shorter: I was disapointed.
4,Don't be suckered by Ada and Van,"Yes, I really liked this book, though not as much as Pale Fire. Reading this book is hard work, best read multiple times, and with the help of analysts such as Boyd. Are the readers below aware that Nabokov expected moralists to eventually come to scorn Ada and Van, despite the romantic gloss they use to cover up their faults? The reason why the novel is difficult is that the ""coauthors Veen"" work very hard to cover their tracks.Nabokov was much more of a moralist than most ofhis fans realize, and he hinted at this in his Strong Opinions. For some reason though, he could only illustrate his morality by creating immoral characters, much as a painter who draws a picture by taking an eraser to a charcoaled canvas.For something totally different in style, and using the opposite and better approach in approaching morality, read Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand."
5,Love the early season releases!!,"A must have for a collector and really, you get a taste of Sandra that even surpasses her personality on the show with some really entertaining and hilarious episode commentaries. A fan fave for a lot of people. Not one of mine but it's still a one of a kind with some of the characters, like Fairplay and Rupert and the twists like the return of the outcasts and the Grandma lie. Gotta have it."
3,My 2nd Least Favourite Season :-l,"I love the show Survivor. It is one of the best reality shows out there and I've seen every season and episode. I think the key to making a successful season of Survivor, is the people. I found these guys the most boring of all. While I didn't like Ruperts attitude at the start with him stealing the other tribes possessions, I thought he was like a big bear and he was one of the better players. I loved Johnny until the ploy with his 'dying grandma' and the rest of the players are fairly forgetable. I am just waiting for Africa and Amazon to come out. They are the best seasons ever. Come on CBS - release the better seasons than this the slower one."
4,Fun cook book,I was really excited about this book and I think it is cool but I really don't use it very often. I usually just get recipes off of the internet.
5,A Hard to Find Gem,"I have been teaching Chaucer for over ten years and believe Jones' book on Chaucer's knight to be an excellent example of literary criticism that debunks the standard view of Chaucer's knight. I am surprised that I have such difficulty finding the book. One would think that it would be available for every student studying Chaucer. As the first character in the prologue, the understanding of the knight sets the tone for the entire work. Jones' research enticed me to do some research on my own. His book made me look at the other characters with a jaundiced eye, and I found the entire work of The Canterbury Tales to be a medieval version of ""Saturday Night Live."" I am now in love with Chaucer because of Jones. The book is worth the read for any student studying Chaucer. Jones makes the medieval world come alive with solid facts to support his perspective."
5,The Pushcart War,"This is the best book I have ever read. I picked an old edition off of a discard cart at my school library and it came in handy when my family car broke down in 85 degree weather in the middle of nowhere.All the characters were great (Maxie Hammerman, General Anna, Moe Mammoth/AKA Big Moe, Mr. Livergreen, The Tiger, Mayor Emmet P. Cudd,The Police Commitioner, Frank the Flower, Morris the Florist, Harry the Hot Dog, Mr. Jarusalem, Wenda Gambling, the children of New York City, Mack,etc) I can't belive I waited almost 13 years to read it!"
2,Calphalon anodize cookware,"I was very excited by this special offer, and since with my current cookware bacon and other foods were sticking to the pan, I wanted a new set. To my dismay, this Calphalon cookware was even worse than the old one. Very handsome to look at but non performing; in addition to sticking, the handles heat up uncomfortably. Not recommended."
1,Better then GLUE,"PROS Great at boiling water, great at not flaking like many nonstick pans.CONS These pots and pans are great except that anything you cook in them sticks.And I do not mean stick like any normal pan. Did these guys add a secret ingredient to make everything adhere? I tried the pans a few times and my wife, kids, and myself ALL quit using them to cook, after just a few attempts. Good for building muscle in our attempts to clean them.Who wants an almost new set (some not even used) for 65% off?"
1,Sticky --- REVISED!!!!,I was too quick to really appreciate these. They take a while to get used to but once you do you will find out they have good qualities. They will brown food unlike anything but cast iron. They are not a non-stick surface but once they are broken in are not that bad. I would give them 4 stars if I could change it.
1,Disappointing - Tried everything and everything sticks!,I purchased my Calphalon piece at a low price and was extremely excited! So disappointing. Their stick resistant technology is a joke! Everything sticks to this pan - foods that don't stick to regular pans -- stick to this one. This was a huge disappointment -- please don't make the same mistake.PS I had Circulon for years and had good luck.
1,Calphalon in name only!,"This has to be one of the worst knock-offs to come out of China. I have other Calphalon products [made in Toledo, Ohio] and this just doesn't compare. The food stuck- had to soak before it could be scrubbed out- the bacon left an outline in the pan, even after it was scrubbed. I guess you get what you pay for so, buyer beware."
2,Low cost and poor,"For $150 its a great price for 5 pots and pans. However, you get what you pay for.Assuming they are delivered with flat bottoms, they continue to warp very easily and are poor choices for smooth top stoves. For whatever reason, they do not saute well. The balance and handling is poor. Between the riveted handles and the lack of a non-stick coating, keeping them clean is tough.If you are on a budget, you can probably do just as well at your local supermarket. If you have the cash, start buying good pans one at a time. They will last a lifetime and are a pleasure to cook with. Think Italian or French. There is a correlation with countries that have a history of fine cooking and the cooking products they produce. The Italian ones tend to be very expensive. The French are far more affordable and cook just as well."
1,Terrible quality - the only item I have ever returned to Amazon,"I have a Calphalon One omelet pan, so I was very excited to see these at a good price on Amazon. When they arrived, they were of such poor quality (made in China, not Toledo, Ohio like the original Calphalon) that I was forced to return them. This is the only item that I have EVER in all my years of buying from Amazon, returned to get my money back.Thank you Amazon, for providing great customer service. Buyer Beware, these are very cheap knock-offs of the Calphalon name. I wish I'd read the reviews more carefully before purchasing!"
3,real Calphalon?,"I thought the price for this ""Calphalon"" set was too good to be true. Now I am questioning if it is the real thing. The pots are labeled with ""Calphalon"" but it says ""Made in China."" I have looked at other products and they say Toledo, Ohio. Interesting... Food seems to stick in the frying pans - but otherwise the performance is good. Does anyone know if they are knock-offs or are genuine?"
2,TERRIBLE,"NONSTICK SURFACE IS BOGUS..... EVERYTHING STICKS TO THESE PANS. NOT HOME FRIENDLY, YOU CAN'T STACK THE PANS IN THE CABINET, CAN'T USE THE DISHWASHER.. BOOO"
2,Was hoping for better,"I have just started cooking on a regular basis. The Hard-Anodized cookwar looks cool and more importantly cooks evenly and true (they conduct heat really well). The only thing is I can't get them clean, even after the first use. I hand washed them with a sponge and they look clean when they are wet. Then I dry them and they look like crap. The pans are smooth and clean, but they don't look clean, there is a weired blochiness. The brochure says to use ajax to bring them back to new, but I don't have the guts to try it. Also you have to be real carefull or everything will stick. I didn't return them, they work, but I would buy something else. (like calphalon one for three times the price?)"
1,impossible,"I must have gotten a different set than everyone who loved this cookware so much, giving it high scores.I was hesitant to order it because despite the good overall score, there were a lot of bad reviews. The price was great though, so I went for it.Big mistake.I followed manufacturer's instructions to the T. Still, everything stuck. Eggs were impossible to make. Pancakes - forget it. Cleaning? I let the pan cool, like instructed. Scrubbed it for 20 minutes and still the pan did not look like new (after ONE use!). The pots and pans were also very heavy..The only good side: they looked nice.I returned them."
3,These are not Non-Stick,"If you are trying to get away from non-stick surfaces (potentially unhealthy but who really knows), then this is one of the few options. These are much more work than non-stick. With non-stick, you spend a little time cleaning and stick it in the dishwasher. These pans require intense cleaning. The best cleaner that I have found is comet. These pans do require a lot of elbow grease. My wife doesn't really care for the set but I am not sure what other options are available to stay away from the teflon coated pans."
2,not non stick,"any thing that you seem to cook in this pan seems to stick, and some worst than others, not a good product. Poor quality."
2,Unexpected low quality,"I purchased a Calphalon commercial hard anodized set about 10 years ago. It has held up well even with my habit of dropping lids (yes, the lids do bend if you drop them on edge). Having used baking soda and taken the anodized finish off my 2.5q pot, I looked for a replacement. This set provided a 2.5q shallow pot, as well as the casserole and fry pan I was also looking for. Calphalon does tell you not to use baking soda in the pots. Ok, the shallow pot was not the one I wanted but was accurately described. However, the older set made in Toledo Ohio is constructed of much heavier aluminum. I am disappointed at the significant drop in quality. And, with china having less quality control, I am uncertain these pans will perform well and have the metal alloy content I expect. I will now look to All-clad made in the USA rather than continue to buy Calphalon."
5,ya gotta read the directions...,"There is a learning curve with this product. You can't cook as if it is Teflon-coated and expect food to slide off the surface. Initially, I, too, found my food stuck, but following the directions -- like having patience and using slightly lower temperatures (so food doesn't burn)-- you'll discover your food develops a wonderful, flavorful crust and indeed will easily come away from the pan. This set replaced my Teflon-coated cookware because in spite of Dupont's claims of safety -- I'm still nervous about PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic acid) contamination. Those dead birds were trying to tell us something..."
1,Quality has gone downhill,"Ever since Calphalon has moved production to China, quality has gone downhill. I am not sure why this company cannot monitoring the quality control overseas.. but in my opinion, they have not. I bought this product recently and it is really really bad. (...), it was very reasonable but at some point, garbage is just not worth it. I am seriously looking at the new KitchenAid stainless line which is also reasonably priced but feels like it is constructed well and appears heavier and studier.."
2,Beautiful but impossible,"We received this set as a wedding gift and I was thrilled! The pans are heavy, well made, and cook evenly. But everything sticks! Even bacon. I tried all types of oil but all food stuck to the pan and left stains even after washing. These had to go back."
3,They look nice,They look nice and the price is good. I read a lot of reviews on these before I bought them. A lot of people said everything sticks to them ... but then there were a lot of people that said that those people don't know how to cook with the pots and pans and led into instructions on how to cook properly with them. So I bought them because I thought I could cook properly with them and EVERYTHING STICKS TO THEM. In the month I have used these I have followed all the directions: I cook everything on low (surprisingly food does cook fast on low with these) and hand wash them with soft sponges. Yet everything still sticks to these. Oh and there really isn't any lids in the set that fit the pans ... usually the lids are universal in sets like these to fit the pots and pans ... not this set. But they do work and it is a fairly inexpensive set. They look nice and they clean pretty easily.
4,"Very funny, even if you're not a cat-person!","I don't like cats. Never did. I'm a dog person, but reading this funny book (someone gave it to me), made me laugh out loud. I hope the authors come up with something as great for dog lovers! It was a perfect break from the ever so serious world of the net."
2,Food sticks but cleans up easily,"This wok is a good quality, steady on the range and nice weight. The only problem is that everything sticks to it, especially pieces of meat that I try to stir-fry. In order not to burn, I have to take them out before they get a nice color. Then I proceed with stir-frying the vegetables but that is hard because there are brown bits on the bottom of the wok left from the previously cooked meat and that starts burning before vegetables are even done. I end up adding water to it so it wouldn't burn but then I don't get a nice sear on the vegetables. I guess the only good side to this wok is that it cleans up easily afterwards and still looks great."
2,Antietam: The Bloodiest Day in American History,"This is a fairly adequate overview of the Battle of Antietam. Generally, reenactors were employed realistically. A major flaw in the video, however, is a lack of good maps to explain in greater depth what actually occurred in the battle."
2,doesn't work w/newer mac or window,The CD-Rom doesn't work with any of computers we have at home (Window vista or Mac OSX). I tried to email them and they don't even respond.
1,So Disappointed!,"I have used other products in the past from this company and never needed to use their customer support or tech support, but this time the CD-rom did not work and I had too. Well, they are the worst. No help for us in this regard except for them telling us that we can buy a different product from them that might work with XP. It is another $159 and it is not geared to this age group. If your computer uses XP DO NOT BUY FROM HOOKED ON PHONICS. Their explanation was that the workbooks will still work without the CD. Are you kidding me! The games are the fun part of this package and things that the kids are interested in, if they don't work what's the point?"
5,hooked on hookd on phonics,Right now I am workding with a kindergartener on the kindergarten level and plan to work with him all summer on the first grade levels so he will be a bit ahead of the ball when he starts first grade in fall. This is a fabulous product.
2,"Confusing, Non-User Friendly, Not for Beginners","The book tried to do too much in too few pages. Important and arcane C concepts were often simply glossed over in a few paragraphs and/or given superficial treatment in a few pages. I didn't get the feeling that one chapter built on another. The language was often (unnecessarily) overly technical.The book has made a decent reference for use during projects. It is also not bad for building some basic programming logic skills. As for developing a beginning-intermediate understanding of C on your own, forget it"
4,"Small and Fast, just what you want","Pros:Tiny, Tiny, TinyFast, Fast, FastGreat manual featuresNice lensSolid buildGreat quality photosLong battery lifeCons:Only 3x optical zoom (thats standard, but more is always better there)no RAW format (for those true pro photographers)I have loved this camera, everyone who sees it is impressed with the quality and speed with which it performs. Minolta has a great history and they did not let me down with this model. It has the features and quality of even the most advanced, much more expensive cameras. I don't know how they did it."
5,Very thought provoking,"I was a student of Proffeser Knowles in the late seventies. This book fleshes out much of the more technical work we did concerning solar access. It will help you, at least, understand the influences of technologies on our perception of or environment and how important our connection with nature really is."
4,Solid effort as Woody returns back to form,"Finally another solid entry in the woody genre as he does what he does best,light drama with twists flavored with comedic one-liners. Casting Larry David to be Woody was obvious yet genius. The story is fluffy yet introspective, mildly humorous and well-rounded. Like his better movies, it's like a cup of warm cocoa on a winter night. Woody plays it by the book and wins!"
1,what was Woody thinkin'?,"This is a shockingly inept movie with few redeeming features. Larry David in particular can't act - he can only be himself, for better or worse. The film (more of a TV show, actually) was shot on the cheap with the minimum effort. Weak, cheesy script. Superficial acting. The assumption seems to be that jokes that (might) work in a Brooklyn shtetl will universally apply. Perhaps not. There is no fun in the film, no depth, little actual humor - just a leering David. I liked the Barcelona film for its depth and awareness of the humanness of attraction, passion and suffering. But this? Awful!"
1,Waste of time.,"This movie was terrible. I could not even force myself to watch the whole thing. Evan Rachel Wood is a terrible actress, I don't know how she gets work. I have seen her in a few films and shows now, and she cannot act for anything.This film was full of so many exhausted plotlines and stereotypes it was ridiculous. I have to wonder why anyone would greenlight this film. I'm just glad a borrowed it from my library and didn't spend money on it."
1,"Very, very disappointed",I am a devoted Woody Allen fan. Love almost every film he has done. Whatever Works does not. It is not funny. It is almost painful to watch. Why Woody Allen would mar his brilliant career with something so inadequate is hard to understand
4,Fun To Watch,"I am a big fan of 1970s Woody Allen. I, however, don't like his 1980s or 90s movies at all but this is a different film. And me thinks this new movie (whatever works) is a right step in the vintage Woody Allen direction. There are a few instances of mediocre acting (the scene where mother of the child rushes into cafe to argue with Boris about her kid's mistreatment by Boris). In any event, I hope he makes more movies like this one. Also, aside from a few anti-American slanders on race and religion, I enjoyed the movie and its message. If you want a few genuine laughs, get this movie and watch it. 4/5"
2,Same old story with bad acting,"This was dissapointing. Larry David is great in his own projects, but really lacked the ability to deliver the nuance in the Woody Allen character. Normally, you feel somewhat sorry for Woody in his enactments, but in this case, you felt contempt. This is the same story that Woody has done over and over, which I expected, but between Larry David's acting problems, and the one-sided leftist propoganda themes, it was really hard to take. I like Woody and Larry on their own, but together they are terrible."
4,Evan Rachel Wood,"This certainly doesn't rank among Allen's best films. It has its embarrassing dead spots, but it also has its very amusing moments, many of which are supplied by the arrivals, separately and separated, of Melodie's parents from Mississippi, and the bizarre surprizes they encounter in NYC. Slim stuff, perhaps, but funny. The thrill of this film is the pleasure of watching Evan Rachel Wood emerge from a misfit runaway into the enchanting beauty she becomes as the film progresses. A casting coup for Allen and a delight for his audience.If you want to see her looking just as great in a very fine film that isn't funny at all, see ""Down in the Valley"", with Edward Norton."
2,UUGGgggg!!,"I was very excited to see such a beautiful ring at such a low price. But my excitement soon faded to disappointment when I recieved my ring. Although it is very well made, the width of the ring just dosen't cover my finger. It leaves the sides of my finger revealed which was not what I was looking for. The ring looks bigger in picture than it did in reality. I hope you will take my warning seariously and not fall for this ring like I did."
3,"basic, usable, as described but cheap","Does everything claimed, but looks and feels cheaper than pictures would have you believe. Bought it, keeping it but would not buy it again."
2,First 100 pages were fascinating...after that...eh.,The first 100 pages were a fun read but after that it was repetitive filler. Save your money.
5,Great book on how to gain peace and serenity in your life.,This is a wonderful book that opened my eyes to the peace and serenity that can be acheived by living in the present moment. It is beautifully written in such a calming and peaceful wat that it is impossible for me to ignore it's teachings.
5,"Your life, better, immediately","This book leaves me speechless. It has changed my life, helping me to be more mindful, which helps me live in the present. (I would have never thought to type such a sentence even one year ago, but midlife has taught me the enormous enjoyment that the present offers.) The lessons can be learned and practiced immediately. Moments after starting it, I had become more able to listen to others, to relax, to enjoy life more fully.Nominated for the 1967 Nobel Peace Price by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Thich Nhat Hanh teaches how to turn the small moments of daily life -- washing dishes, driving the car -- into meaningful engagement.If you are willing to read only one book on finding inner peace, on learning to meditate, on living in the present, here is that book. It is short and sweet -- and very accessible, not pie-in-the-sky philosophical."
3,Apron strings,"It's hard to find what you have grown accustom to. Take this apron, basically a good design. Fabric resists grease and dirt. Pockets are handy but beware of the apron strings. I think the apron waist tie should go around your waist and not around your butt. I am not short (5'11"") and with the waist tie that low the apron wants to ride up exposing my pant legs. Maybe they expect you to keep the waist string loose but I like mine tight. Oh well, maybe i can get my wife to do an alteration."
3,Good flashlight,I used several flashlights of this type as ship surveyor and can say that the newer versions are lower quality (made in china) than before.Cons:1. this flashlight is big and very heavy2. the battery lasts about 2 hours3. the switch is not so strong4. cannot charge a spare battery on original charger5. if you hit the flashlight you burn the bulbThe power adapter failed after one month.Pros:1. focus ability2. good light
5,tried and true,"A well known, tried and true product with enormous light output and long battery life. We own many."
5,Entertaining Universal TV Movie Great Cast,"Having been a fan of early TV Movies, I found this one quite enjoyable and the TMG (Timeless Media Group) print is superb. I will be ordering more titles from this company, based on the quality of this DVD. Excellent cover design with accurate stills fromthe film."
5,better than your can imagine,"a tip, the cushion should be placed vertically on the chair, especially for men using.you can fell the difference after long time sitting compare to without using the cushion."
3,Mixed feeling,"I bought this product because this type was recommended by my chiropractor (although not necessarily this product). Whenever I sit on this, I strain my back and neck. Not worth the money. But if anyone is comfortable with it, by all means, use it. For my part, it only qualifies for 3 stars at most."
3,A good resource book,"This is not the easiest textbook I've ever used, but with a class, I was able to use it as a reasonable reference book. I've heard that this is actually one of the better books, which makes me wonder about the other books..."
1,Absolute garbage,"just skim the cases and read chirelstein and farnsworth. this casebook is an absolute joke and will teach you more about the market for whaling oil in nantucket (seriously - see the section on gardner v gray) than the law of contract, whatever that may in fact be."
2,Not designed for a real dog,"If your terrier is shaped like a beer keg, has the leg length of a greyhound, and no neck then this rain jacket will fit well. However, if you have an average proportioned mid-sized pooch, then be prepared to heavily modify it."
4,Great rain coverage and nice features,"I was a little skeptical about getting my dog a raincoat, but after a few too many messy wet dog moments right before going to bed or leaving for work, I decided to give it a shot.This is a good product that does the job. It's long enough to cover his tail but not too long to drag. The way the fabric hangs, it channels the water down and away from his legs, which is really key to keeping him dry.The hood is nice and there is a pocket on the back, although I can't imagine using it. I do like that there's a leash hole so he can still wear his harness if I'm taking him out on a leash. Two small complaints: he hates the elastic leg straps, although you can technically not use them, and the end of the belly strap is almost too big to fit through the slot. You have to turn it diagonal and pull a corner through, but that does the trick. My dog is an 18-lb wire fox terrier and the medium fits loosely but well."
1,Powder Burned,"If you enjoy 257 pages of strung together clichés - this books for you. The author trips over his writing and tries so hard to be clever - the book becomes painful to read. If you like lines like "" Microsoft of the powder processors"" stung together with ""AT&T of the uphill transportation business"" go for it! If you really want to read this book - just read the 19-page epilogue - this must have been the only part reviewed by an editor!"
2,Andy Deris is a real sorry replacement for Michael Kiske!!!,"I'm sorry,but I can't own any of Helloween's new album's.I think the new singer is a really sorry replacement for the Legendary Michael Kiske,and is not even worth listening too,but I guess if I had to listen,I'd probably listen to their Better than raw album.Just because it's much better than this one.Although I don't consider there new stuff even power metal.It just sounds weird,and kinda fast to me.I'd recommend this to regular metal fans,not Power metal ones.Not to mention people who just don't care how good a singer is.Like Gamma Ray fans,Manawar fans,and Megadeth fans...For the rest of us,there's Pagans Mind,Nocturnal Rites,Firewind,Primal Fear,and many,many more..."
5,One question,I have but one question: Why is there a picture of Hellowen with Michael Kiske in the insert?otherwise a very good Helloween lp
3,Good,It was very nice book. :-)Everyone should read it .You will like it more if you read the other books
4,midnight on the moon,One reason i liked this book is because it takes you plases that you have always wanted to go .Like the moon it shose you the advenchers that they have and all the truble they get in while ther there.It olso discribes the senary relly whel it mackes you feeal like your right ther runing along besid them as ther on the moon and relly streaches your amagenation. it is a relly good book to read it is reely exsiting and it is pretty easey to read and it gives you good discriptions of whats going on in the story so you know what is going on at all times and it also discribes the carecters relly whell so its easey to set down and imagen what they look like .

4,Nice scented dandruff shampoo,The shampoo doesn't lather. But it has a nice subtle scent that lasts all day. And it seems to be doing it's job at fighting dandruff since my hair has been itch-free since I started using it. So I would recommend it.
4,Solid EP from an underrated group.,"This EP is a good one. From start to finish it's very interesting musically asnd the rappers are all talented (Pace Won and Young Zee stand out). This album contains the track Rush Ya Clique featuring an excellent verse from, then unknown, Eminem. I'd recommend it to any fans of Eminem's early work. Overall, this EP is worth getting and a welcome addition to any rap fan's collection."
2,Can't believe I spent money on this,"This pad of paper looks like something that was photocopied back in the 90s. It has no cover and is just a pad of paper. You could easily find an image of this online, print it out at home, and it would be the exact same thing as this product. The paper however is a great guide for learning calligraphy."
1,$14.50 to ship a $1.50 Item?,"if this isn't a scam, what is? And amazom lets it happen. This is a pad of paper. I promise to alert everyone I know that amazon is crooked. I intend to post this on facebook and twitter. They may have my money, but bad PR can circle the globe."
4,Nice large pad,"Great for beginners that are just learning as the lines are really big. There was no cover on my pad, but it wasn't too hard to figure out which way it went."
5,new,"This is the first time I've tried the Yankers for my Boston Terriers(notorious chewers). So far they love it, they chewed a hole in the tail so I had to sew it but it is back in action now good as new to them. Great tug of war toy."
4,Great watch for price.,"I'm purchasing plastic band watches now due to a reaction with my skin to metal ones. This watch would have gotten a 5 of 5 if the glow in the dark markers worked a little better. They are quick to dim in glow, but that is not a major detractor for me. The watch has dual time, stopwatch, and alarm. I like the hourly chime. Being technically oriented, I didn't need the instruction manual to set the thing. So all in all, this is not a Rolex, but I am very satisfied with its operation, easy to read analog dial and digital features. If the watch dies, I will definately buy another one of this model."
3,The Goods and the Bads,"I thought the book was great, but there were a few problems. I think the book could have been ""tightened"" up a bit. I thought it did a good job in setting it up for a possible sequel, maybe 2 and possibly even 3. I think with the setup as it is will require some stunning events and surprises, in order for it to equal the last 3. All in all I think it was an exceptional piece of work. I wait breathlesly for the next one to come out."
5,It was a crazy game of poker!,"How 'bout that book was so good? oh, i want the fourth one so bad now!! I cried and laughed so hard, too... emotional rollercoaster is hardly a good way to describe this book!!! such an awesome read, but i'm confused why it said nothing of a 4th book... if you know when it is s'posed to come out e-mail me and we can talk er somfin'!!!!! oh! i loved the books!!!!! i'm such a dork... (firethorne@hotmail.com)"
5,"great, lightweight flashlight","I bought this to help walk the dog late at night. It gives the perfect amount of light to see where you're going, but not enough for the neighbors to call the cops. It's lightweight, which is good when struggling with a playful puppy. Overall, this flashlight made my life easier as I am no longer walking into thorn bushes."
5,MAGS ARE STILL THE BEST,"I know that LEDs are now all the rage. But the light emitted just isn't the same. Mag Lights may not be at the peak of technology, but they work great, are heavy duty and reliable. Would it surprise you to know that I don't own a smart phone? (I don't even know what one is!!) This Mag Light is the perfect size for the glove box or anywhere that a smaller size is desired. My fantasy is to own a 5 D cell model. Whoooooo!!"
5,Thank You,"I caution a reader of this review that I am biased. Koufax was my hero as were all the Dodgers of the 60s. Therefore, I am not able to offer an objective view.For those who share my view this book is must reading. You will not be disapointed. In fact, you will discover that Koufax was all we ever thought-and more.To the rest, I promise a well written book which not only examines a man of great balance, but reveals an author of exceptional ability."
1,Disappointing,"I knew little about Sandy Koufax before I read this book and I don't seem like I know that much more now. This was one of the most disjointed baseball biographies I have ever read. The author spent so much time jumping around from periods earlier in Koufax's life to current reflections on Koufax, that the book did not flow the way I feel a good biography should. The nine chapters on Koufax's perfect game was not worthwhile to the flow of the book and did not add any real insight to Koufax that was not covered elsewhere in the book. The author kept trying to make Koufax a product of the 60s, but no strong argument exists that he was much more than a very good baseball player during this period. This book does not stand up to excellent baseball biographies by Robert Creamer or Charles Alexander or even good ones like the book on Joe Dimaggio by Richard Ben Cramer or Jackie Robinson by Arnold Rampersad. Koufax is an excellent subject for a biography, but this book fails."
5,Brooklyn Flamethrower,"I am a Jewish New York Yankee fan who grew up in Brooklyn, so I read this book with mixed emotions. I would pray, when Sandy was scheduled to pitch against my Yankees, that his arm would fall off or Mickey Mantle would hit a home run every at-bat. But neither happened.This is a well-written book that brought me back to a time in my youth, of happiness and sadness. A time I don't often revisit as I am a live for today kind of a guy. It was certainly interesting to read Jane Leavy's take on him. She is a premier baseball biographer, as she recently again proved with her Mickey Mantle book, ""The Last Boy.""I highly recommend ""Sandy Koufax: A Lefty's Legacy"" as a view into a private life and a re-creation of a time and place that produced greatness 8in so many different fields.Jane Leavy, ya done good!Neil L. Yuzuk, AuthorBeachside PD Series"
3,made my wife happy,"Note: this review is for the Digest More 90 Caplets Bottle, not the more expensive ""Ultra"" version.My wife seems to think these pills work in helping her digest food better, yet I'm not convinced because she still has the symptoms she's been trying to treat.I have tried to compare these to the ""Ultra"" version, and can't really decipher what the ingredients are. Seems like a lot of harmless herbs. From experience in her having herbalists and so-called alternative-medicine specialists subscribe all sorts of stuff, I'm of the opinion that this stuff is generally a bunch of nonsense.But when you need help, you need help, and you have to try different things. For some people who have sensitive reactions to herbs and spices, this stuff might help. I'd suggest you try the regular version before you shell out $45 for the ""Ultra"" bottle."
5,It's a good deal.,I like them very much. Very reasonably price and beautiful scenery in old britain is painted on each dish. These dished were exactly what I was looking for long time.
5,The Bible of Fundraising,I was so tired of trying to wade through dense books on fundraising and marketing. This book lays it out clearly and simply. Fundraising is common sense--so is this book. Should be read by anyone launching an annual and capital campaign.
5,Better ad Cheaper than Adobe,"I have been using different versions of this product for 10 years. It is simpler and easier than using acrobat. works well with vista, too."
4,Great shampoo,Love this line of hair products.... Takes all the frizzies away and cleans well without stripping hair.Its expensive but worth the extra cost!
5,Excellent shampoo for my kind of hair,"My hair is curly and tends to be frizzy. This shampoo helps to keep it under control. Buying it in a large size, as I did, proves to be less expensive in the long run."
5,Because we're worth it,"A British hairdresser prescribed L'oreal's high-end product line for my thick, wavy, Indian hair. He also recommended the Kerastase masque treatment. Both are godsends to someone such as I who'd previously only ever selected haircare products from club card discounts on supermarket shelves & would've balked at the idea of such an expense. If Oleo-Relax doesn't work up a nice lather the first time you use it, here's one case where you have to rinse then repeat. Total strangers ask me if they can feel my hair, and I get compliments all the time. But even without other people complimenting me, I can feel that my hair isn't as coarse as it used to be. I've been using this product for the 2 years since I began shacking up with the hairdresser, but his salon doesn't sell L'Oreal, which means that he can't just steal me some from work but instead I have to buy it from Amazon for my own damn self. But hey, I'm worth it."
2,Step back in time,"I'm with Walt. Overall less than thrilled. Wouldn't buy them again.I assumed shared phonebooks would naturally be the case. After all, it's been that way with Vtech phones for awhile.Also don't like the keypad setup. Can't attest to the voice quality yet as I've just started using them. Inadvertently hung-up on someone will answering the first inbound call. Watch out for the speakerphone button."
5,Indispensable!,"I bought three of these. I keep them at various places around the house, so that whenever you need to look behind or under something you have light available.They are tough, durable, bright and, because of their size, incredible convenient The Mag company definitely has another winning flashlight model here!"
5,Great stuff but be clear what it is...,"I agree with the previous reviewer about the quality of this material, but let's be clear -- this isn't western swing, it's jazz, jazz, jazz played by the hottest Nashville session players of the 1950's (the famous Nashville Cats of the song). Jethro Burns has a well-deserved reputation as one of the most innovative jazz mandolinists ever, and Dale Potter.... well, everyone was trying to play fiddle like him. Vassar Clements got almost all his whole style from Potter. And one final correction: Jerry Byrd never, ever went near a pedal!"
5,Sierra Wildflowers,this is a great book for novices and hobbyists. it was in perfect shape and I received earlier than anticipated.
5,"Excellent, particularly the photos","This is an excellent book. I agree with the other reviewer who noted the quality of the organization and the photos--it has some of the best photos of any wildflower guidebook I've seen. This is a field guide, not a flora, so the comments by another reviewer regarding the species not in the book aren't really very relevant."
2,not another compilation,"This is one of my favorite groups, but I get tired of buying the same songs over and over again. We don't need another <Greatest Hits> or <Collection>. Clannad already has the dubious distinction of having more compilation albums than fresh ones."
3,Machiavel - self-titled (Spalax),"Belguim band's so-so self-titled debut effort, originally released in 1976. I liked their follow-up to this lp 'Jester' (see my review) a little better. Best described as eclectic progressive. As for the songs, I thought that the seven-minute ""Johan's Brother Told Me"" reminded me of maybe Barclay James Harvest, sort of liked the ballad ""Cry No More"" and the nine-minute ""When Johan Died, Sirens Were Singing"". CD's last three cuts are added bonus cuts - unreleased 1974 songs. Line-up here is only a four-piece - Marc Ysaye - drums & vocals, Jack Roskam - guitar, Roland De Greef - bass and Albert Letecheur - keyboards. Doubt I'll seek out any more music from Machiavel."
2,Yeah Right! lets get real,The only reason this is getting a 2 because its DR. Dre where talking about. This is stupid I mean why make instrumental stuff for wanna be people that don't no how to rap and think they can flow good. and anyways the tracks don't even sound like the originals it sound like some Christina Aguilera stuff. But oh well I know you are not going to listen to me and you are probably going to buy this any ways.
1,Whats the difference between me and you???,"Shall we go back to basics. The beats are good, but use your common sense. A rap album is surely incomplete without the rap.So whats the difference between us? You spent your cash on just the beats, while I scored the beats AND the raps.Or maybe we could start at the ...... ?"
4,A very handy tool!,"I've had this multi-tool for a little over a week and I've used it for something everyday. When I was shopping for one of these I looked at several different brands and was most impressed with the Shrade. I was especially pleased with the locking mechanism, it is positive and holds well. The pliers hold excellently and the handles are comfortable. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that when you are trying to get a tool out of the handles, the ones beside it also try to raise out and you have to put them back in. A minor point though, especially when it saves you from having to go get in the toolbox! Overall an excellent product!"
4,Best writing/English/reading textbook ever,"In high school I didn't write much other than my English class assignments so it's probably a good thing I hadn't yet been exposed to this resourceful textbook while still too immature to appreciate it.Writer's Inc is the best writing/English/reading textbook I've ever seen -- an everything learning guide for every subject that writing touches, which is nearly everything. The book's only major flaw is it tries to cover too many subjects, and that's probably a result of it being specifically for the classroom.Regardless, the tone is warm and true. This is an invitation to leave your reservations behind and come explore the world through writing."
5,Great Resource,"I first used this book in high school and now that I am a teacher, I still have my book and am now introducing it to my students. It is a great book to access information on writing, thinking and understanding subject matter in general. It is so easy to understand and and reference from. Anything from writing resumes to plantet info."
3,This is not the Tango 2007...,"We were looking for the Tango 2007 and ordered this one because of the price (50% less). Although nice, it didn't have some of the important features we were looking for - independent canopies, the ability for one seat to recline while the other is up-right and the ability to hold a car seat. We have returned this stroller and purchased the 2007."
2,A warning,"OK, this isn't a review so much as a warning, and it'll probably get lost among 100+ reviews, but just be aware what you're getting yourself into. This was originally going to be a four-book series but now it's SIX (two trilogies, not counting the somewhat interrelated HOW FEW REMAIN prequel).Browse the reviews for the third and fourth (when it's out) books in the series and see if you still think it's worth your time. Like many HT series, THE GREAT WAR gets off to a great start and then quickly turns tedious and repetitive. I gave up after three books; I have better things to do with my life than slog through this stuff."
4,A Good Book from Harry Turtledove,"Turtledove has written another good read. I read his WORLDWAR series and both HOW FEW REMAIN and GUNS OF THE SOUTH. He has a way to paint pictures with his words. I believe that the personal angles to some of the characters adds flavor and insight to the mood and soul of the USA, CSA and Canada. It also explains the motivations of some people.Like many who read AH I too am a student of history. What strikes me is how much AH revolves around war. What would the Cold War be like in AH? But, I digress.What most criticism does not take into account are the many little things that happen in the intervening 50 years that could bring the two sides to where they are. AH could not possibly be anything but 50% correct at best after 50 years. Almost all commentary had a point, yet they could be equally as wrong as what is depicted here in AMERICAN FRONT."
3,Definitely not Turtledove's best,"I liked The Great War: American Front, but this was definitely not Turtledove's greatest work.For one, the only character I can really delve into is the aging George Custer, who was very entertaining, but most of his characters seem so plastic.I didn't like the lack of maps, which were critically needed.I know war books sell, but I also don't think the US and the CS would continue to fight wars every 30 years.Still, I'm looking forward to the sequel.I'm also positive the series will end with the belligerents declaring an cease fire, just like the real war."
4,a slow begining but it gets better as it goes on,"This book is a little harder to follow than How Few Remain because there are more characters. The story is very hard to follow the first hundred to hundred-fifty pages. In How Few Remain many of the characters were real and famous people. This makes the story easier to follow. Unfortuantly the only actual person that has a large part in this book is Custer. In my opinion this book doesn't let you choose sides. Just as you might start feeling sorry, or rooting for one of the sides, Turtledove starts telling the story from the other sides point of view. This book shows how horrible war really is."
3,I liked it,I liked this book. I couldn't put it down. I wonder what does he have against Mormons. If he had taken any time to study the Mormaon religion he would have found that they never would have fought against the United States. I think if he is going to make a religion look bad he might as well learn all the facts.
5,Akuzuki Harwood Floor Nailer,"The nailer worked great. I did over 1200 square feet of 3/4"" oak flooring and the gun did not jam once. I was careful to always check that there were always nails in the gun. As I did the work by myself it took me three weeks. If I had rented a gun, it would have cost much more."
4,"Pretty good, some lasting insights","A pretty good little self-help book that leads us to reflect on what might be hindering us in becoming truly happy. I like the author's recognition, especially in the last chapter, of the importance of the spiritual life, especially prayer. He also has a very interesting discussion of Alcoholics Anonymous and how faith in God is important in overcoming our own psychological limitations and addictions."
4,Works Great!,"Have used this on three separate occasions for camping. Works great as long as you balance your load, otherwise it may lean slightly to one side. Using on a Jeep Liberty no problems with exhaust heat or clearance."
5,Valley delux hitch mount cargo basket,Worked great! I would also definitely order the rola expandable cargo bag with it. We weren't going to at first then decided it wouldn't hurt to get that also for the 17+ hour trip we were taking. Good thing we did it rained the whole way back and kept our things nice and dry! We camp a lot so I see us using it for those trips also.
4,tow rack,"Item was easy to assemble and did well on our trip from VA to Orlando and back. Get a big tarp (at least 8 x 10) and good ratcheting straps and use a second person to put it on the vehicle. I would give it five stars but already rusting in spots after one trip. Nothing a can of rustoleum can't fix though This is a nice product, not cheaply built and fits pretty snug in the tow bar."
4,Valley Deluxe carrier - Jeep Wrangler,"Received product quickly. Box was beat up but contents were fine. Goes together quickly and is sturdy enough to carry my hunting supplies, coolers, etc... I wish it had a bit more bend on it or the bend was adjustable,so it sits level. When I slide it in my hitch, it has quite a bit of play. I'll wind up threading the hitch so I can hold the carrier secure from the bottom and hopefully take out some of the 'droop'. Tilting my hitch upwards is not an option on my bumper. [...]"
1,"Creationist misunderstanding of basic science,","Faulkner gets almost everything wrong in his explaination and th rason is simple: He starts off with the conclusion that God created the Universe 6000 years ago and created a 'young sun', then cherry-picks the evidence that be twisted and widely interpreted to possibly support that theory, a method that goes against basic Scientific Method. While Faulkner might HAVE a Ph.D, he certainly doesn't act like it."
1,Gardening?,"After getting this book as a hand me down gift and going online to find other fitness books, I have come across this one and feel I should give it the review it deserves. I was amazed that the author could put a title saying you can be sleek and sexy after 8 weeks. Ok I know it's a commercial ploy to reel us plump suckers in but Yeager includes GARDENING in her fitness recommendations as ""the ultimate workout for women who hate to exercise."" The exercises are simple enough but come on. That's a lot of vigorous weeding. Could anyone stoop to a lower come on to patronize us slower matabolized folks? I guess only a coupon for fat free donuts may help sell more books. Try Pilates Workbook: Illustrated Step-by-Step Guide to Matwork Techniquesby Michael Kingfor a good way to ease into a nice exercise program."
5,Great book,"I found this book to be very helpful and informative. I have purchased it for others who have found it so, as well.Forward by J.E. Adams and John MacArthur did not hurt either!"
4,"Fun to read, but mixes apples with oranges","This lively, amusing book touches on many ways that people relate to the cosmos, from astrophysicists to the Heavens Gate cult. That is a virtue, in the sense of providing the reader with a wide variety of material. It also is a weakness, in that highly reputable scientists are implicitly equated with flakes. The author should have drawn a sharper distinction between those he took seriously and those he found ridiculous. The net effect is to introduce a giggle factor into our views of anyone who finds the external universe fascinating and relevant to our future.Achenbach is a bit too worshipful toward Carl Sagan and former NASA Administrator Dan Goldin. In particular, he glosses over the fact that Goldin's faster, better, cheaper policy led to three major mission failures in the late 1990's."
5,"Much better than 2004's ""a live recording""","While there is soloing/improvisation on Alive on planet earth, there is not the noodling/jamming faction found on 2004's ""a live recording"" that marred the recording.As well, there seems to be more enjoyment from the band that shows in the tracks (no going through the motions).A great live recording and a great introduction to the band as well.P.s. The first side starts off with a 90 second avant garde jazz inroductory theme, thus better to imform those you want to get into the band as that may turn them offBy the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves, thus the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews"
4,good,"there are many types of music that many different people enjoy. for this particualar type of music i think that it is pretty good. it gives you a good vibe. like you can sit in a cafe and chill to most of the music. it makes you feel close to home. like said before it gives you a little ""blend of bowie, liz phair,and a little ricky martin to boot (loki productions nyc)."" but overall it is ver different but different=good. so i give it 4 stars."
3,Not compatible,"I read several other reviews and decided to take a chance and see if the c120s would work with my Audiovox, and of course only one headphone worked. The mic didn't work either. Make sure you have the right phone."
3,not bad but better out there,Not too bad sound but the crazy earpieces are really annoying. These did not come with foam pieces just different sizes of those crazy plastic inserts.
2,Not working,These stereo earbuds would be nice if both of the earpieces actually work. But the sound quality that I got from one of the earpieces was really nice and clear. Definitely returning this and try to purchase another one.
2,Worth $1,"I bought this product via BTO, Inc. and the product review was far different than the product I received. There was only one set of gel earpieces, and they were each put on the wrong earphone. I noticed this as soon as I took them out of the package, and I switched the gels (which were coded ""left"" and ""right"" for a literate person's convienence)and while taking off the ""right"" gel, the left earphone broke in two. I stuffed it back in the correct gel piece and now the set is - by all appearances - operational. I'm less than impressed, even for a $4 purchase. I'll spend more next week when this pair breaks for the second time."
1,One Speaker doesn't work,"These are terrible earphones, the left speaker does not work at all. They seem pretty comfortable, and the sound out of the right speaker was pretty loud, but I need both sides of the earphones to work. This was a waste of my 5 bucks. Now I have to spend money to send them back? I suppose this company expects people to not bother with shipping them back, and that's how they make their money. Don't buy these!"
2,Underwhelming,"The eargels turn an unpleasant yellow color in a few weeks. They are strange looking and a little too intimate. The left side cord is ridiculously long and tangles every time you store the headphones. The gels make tangling even more extreme.Like the other reviews say, no foam is included. I actually returned the first pair I bought, thinking the foam pads were accidentally left out.The in ear sound is OK. The gels fit well. I get complaints from callers about the sound from the mic.I am looking for a replacement, I will throw these away when I find it."
3,Great Convenience - Poor Durability,"I've just finished using my second set of C-120s. The first set shorted out from the constant flex where the wire meets the plug. The second? .... You guessed it. Same problem. I've had it about 4 months each time.That said, the convenience is great. I like the included 3.5 plug, and several times a day I switch them. The extra plug actually fits into the lapel clip when not being used.I'll probably buy the third set tonight, and wrap the wire/plug area with something strong in advance. By now the price is under $10, and for the sound quality and convenience, it's an acceptable deal."
1,Cheap Price for a reason,I would not recommend these earbuds unless you're really cheap like me and don't mind your ears hurting. Or maybe it's just me and my ears aren't shaped to the earbuds shape. My ears hurt and i think it damaged my left ear because it didn't know how to fit it in my ear the first time and kept twisting and shoving it in my ear. I'm looking into buying another set of earbuds without the weird earbud shape.Jabra C120 Stereo Earbuds - 2.5mm
2,they were ok,The ear bud worked for a week then they stopped working. The wires started showing and now i have to push on them just so i can hear my music or convos.
2,Don't waste your $10,"How could this little $10 pamphlet be called a book? Effectively, the content amounts to only 1 chapter of a regular book, and there's nothing significant here that's not covered in many good Help Desk books."
5,"Wonderful story, and yes the ending is a shocker, so if...","you're faint of heart, perhaps this wouldn't be for you. However, I believed R.Pilcher's recommendation was good enough for me, especially (considering) her sense of reality in each of her novels. Real life isn't always rosey, and bizarre occurrences happen to the best families. I'm not usually stumped, but Ms. Whitnell had me rapidly tearing through this book in order to find out... ""who-done-it""... ! If you like stories about young people growing up in England and accept there are some harsh realities to contend with, you'll enjoy this interesting story!"
3,poorly written,This storyline is all over the place. Poorly written and completely unbelievable. Definitely wont look up other books by this author.
4,Electric God,"I chose this book because the author wrote Pay It Forward. It jumped around in time, but that wasn't a problem for me. The behavior of the main character (Hayden) was puzzling to me until I continued reading and came to understand his anger and frustration. His wasn't an easy path, but Electric God is a story of redemption."
1,Worst book I've read in years,"I hate it when I buy a hardcover book and I feel like I have to finish it to justify the expense. I enjoyed Pay it Forward, so I took a chance on this one. This book is loosely based on the book of Job, but at one point, a priest tells the main character, that Job's family was restored to him, this of course isn't true at all, Job had more children, but his previous family didn't come back to him. I couldn't like any of the characters, even when she went back in time to show what a lousy father he had. It started out pathetic and got more so the more I read. It finished with a Hollywood b movie happy ending. Skip this one."
3,Electric God,I enjoyed this book. It dug into life. The side that most of us don't like talking about. I don't know if I really liked the main character. I certainly didn't excuse his actions because he had a tough life. If the author wrote the book with intent of me feeling sorry for someone it didn't work.Still like the characters or not the book was well written. It was a easy read and you felt like you knew everyone personally in the book when you were finished. I may even be a little weak with only three stars but I can't see four.
2,Macho Anger Run Amuk,"A very odd and unsettling book, about a macho-kinda guy you lets his anger rob him of a life, and who leaves behind him a string of emotionally and physically battered people. Despite the interweaving of the Jonah and Joe stories, this is not a gentle read, or even a very sympathetic one. The first few pages of the story are unsettling, and perhaps a cheap trick on the part of the author to pull the reader into a story that simply does not really make it. Hayden Reese meets obstacles in his life, but rather than acknowledging them head on with the grace of God, he strikes out at everyone until he only has himself and a mean, lonely existence. Hitting bottom brings about all kinds of changes in his life, and hopefully there is a message here of hope and grace, if you can get past the hurtful (long lasting) anger. I was unimpressed and unmoved."
3,Buen Producto... Pero llego con desperfectos,El Colchon inflable tenia abiertas las costuras y no puede meterse sino un niño o dos niños pequeños porquet queda muy endeble.-
1,Garbage,"I was very disappointed with this DVD player. It crapped out almost exactly one year after I bought it. At nine and half months, it was freezing the scenes on my DVDs and I had to unplug the thing and replug it in order to take out my DVD. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
1,BAD PRODUCT,"Purchased this item from Target, thinking it was a Great Deal, due to item was on Sale for Christmas December 2003. System worked Great for approximately 7 months. Keep in mind, that I only used the product actually 4 times total, in the 7 months.Unit does not power up anymore, apparently when you shut off the unit, it stays in standby mode, with a red (led) indicator light. Well the light is no longer on, and the unit does not power up at all. Unit is completely dead.Other electronics on power strip still working fine, so it wasn't a power surge or anything.Not worth the aggrevation and expense to get the unit checked out or repaired. Save your money,and buy a different brand."
1,disposable!,"I bought this under 18 months ago and it is DEAD. I RARELY watch dvds, so I'm guessing it played about 20 during its brief lifetime. In addition, I had to finish at least 2 of those on my computer, because it couldn't read them. It was cheap, but I still feel as if I threw $40 down the disposal!"
1,Stopped working after sometime,I bought this one year before. Now it is not playing any DVDs and get stuck after half hour or so. Sometimes it is not even playing single scree of even new DVDs. My friend also reported the same behaviour. I won't suggest this product to anyone.
4,"7 months later, still going strong","I bought our player Christmas 2003 for our bedroom. It is a perfect size and is still going strong. We use it extensively on the weekends (at least once a day Friday-Sunday) and once or twice during the week. The majority of movies are checked out from the video store while the others come from our own collection.Not the greatest remote or interface but once we learned it, it is actually a tad easier to use than our Sony.Hiccups have been forgettable. While I wasn't expecting much with the price, it has totally exceeded my expectations."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,This dvd player only worked for about a month. Dont waste your money. From the other reviews it seems like this dvd is famous for not working.
4,Big bang in a small package for little $$$,"I bought this player just to play DVD+-RW as my panasonic could only play DVD-R and this thing delivers like a champ. First off it is small which makes it easy to transport to other rooms + has gotten many compliments for its size. Secondly, it plays every format!!! DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD-RW, CDR, CDRW... Very impressive. This little box is packed with features, component output, screen saver when playing MP3s (very important to avoid burn in) and it also saves where you left off in the DVD even after you power down. I've only had it for 3 weeks, so I can't comment on its reliability, so that's why it's only 4 stars and not 5. Runs quietly also.After some use, this unit does not last long. Had to return and got another. Seems to be lasting longer this time around though."
2,Exactly a year,"I purchased this DVD player in mid-January last year. It worked well all year and died last weekend. Not bad for the price. The only complaint I had before it died was the humming sound, it's quite loud, but you get what you pay for. I probably won't buy another, but I feel it was probably worth the money."
5,Great Bedtime Book for School-Age Kids,"This is one of those books that both parents and children will equally enjoy. My children are older now, but we still read together at night as a family ""closing ceremony."" An intelligent, funny book this like one just makes the experience so much more memorable. Our family reads a lot, but we've never read anything like The Birbal Tales. It is literally outstanding in its combination of history, world culture, cleverness, and surprise endings."
2,The Worst Thermal Management,"This unit, from the factory, has severe thermal problems. It will overheat and shut down, even under light usage. There are updates that will reduce the temperature slightly, but the best recommendation is to install a cooling fan.If you buy one of these, expect to pay $125 for updates and a fan to be installed. Otherwise is is essentially unreliable and useless.A cute mixer, very badly designed. I would not recommend this product to anybody."
5,How to Draw Bambi,Another gift for my son who is an art major. He hopes to work for Disney studios when he gets his BA
5,Very Nice Lighthearted Romantic Drama!!,This film is a very nice lighthearted romantic drama about 2 playwrights(Dudley Moore and Mary Steenburgen)and their romantic interest in each other that gains momentum throughout the years until a final resolution results.It's a very sweet must see!!
4,Does the trick,"I bought this to clean my jewelry before moving, and it was pretty easy to use. It worked on everything and got the tarnish off like I needed. It was a little time consuming and smells horrible, but I will definitely use it again when needed."
4,My Review for The Thislte of Scotland by L.B. Greenwood,"I liked this book mostly. I read it for a book report but I read very slow and this is a long book. It has 205 pages and I almost finished it. It was a very interesting book and I encourage you to read it if you enjoy Sherlock Holmes, or any mystery for that matter! I haven't got my book report returned but I think I did well! So, go read it!"
5,GOLD!!!,"How can you hold back?! You can have a stylish black faced analog (YES- ANALOG!) watch with gold details for less than $10!!! I love this watch, but then again, I love not spending a lot of money on a timepiece. Best of all, you can watch the confusion on your child's face when they ask you the time and you show them the clock. ""Oh, it's not digital?"" Yeah, baby... this is old skool! I would only recommend against this watch if you are uncertain about the hash marks. If that's the case, look at the next casio in the price list and for (I think) $0.50 more, you can have number on your watch face... Love it!"
5,The Quality Surpasses the Price,"I personally love to have some sort of sporty look (Nikes, White Shirt, etc) and I personally think this watch is one of the best for that type of look. I mean, by itself it looks fantastic, especially for the price, but what I really think completes the look is look of the band, it just really compliments the look. If you want to look more formal, I wouldn't recommend this simply because of how cheap it looks compared to Omega, TAG Huer, Patek Philippe, Cartier, etc. Otherwise, perfect watch if you're trying to maintain that sporty look."
2,dead battery?,"i like the look of this watch and it was wonderfully simple. but it shipped with a bad battery, as it would stop working within 5 minutes of setting the time. now it doesn't do anything at all. extremely unhappy with this purchase."
2,"Looks nice, but doesn't work so good.","It looks like a great watch and I get compliments on it all the time, but for some reason every minute the time changes, so the two stars is for functionality, I'd give a 1 star if it didn't look so stylish."
2,Decent Watch,"Watch performed fine for seven weeks. Then the battery died. If you throw in the cost of a new battery, it is only an ok deal."
4,It's a nice watch and totally worth the value!,"I was little disappointed to see the size of the watch (it looked slightly smaller to me), but I am totally satisfied with the look, and it's a Casio for that price!"
4,Very good for $10,"This is just about as inexpensive a watch as it's possible to get, and it works fine. No alarm or even illuminated dial, but if you have a cell phone for that, then this is perfect."
1,This is a swindle,Please do not buy this dvd. If you have the laserdisc (or the original VHS )(original title: Jazzvisions: Rio revisited) you will have a very best image and sound converting it to DVD with an apropiate program and a computer.Who are this guys and why are they making this garbage ?
1,terrible,"I loved his first CD. Advocated his music to all my friends. Read the book ""Blink"" mainly because I heard he was in it. Counted down the days to the release of ""Make Sure They See My Face."" This CD is miserable. I want my money back."
1,not what I thought,"I wanted gold lids for my daughters wedding which is the color in the picture and when I recieved them they were silver, Go Figure. I thought you could trust what the discription was online."
4,Healing from emotional abuse.,"When I finally said aloud I was being emotional abused. It was freeing but the reaction I got was shocking. In fact, I was scoffed at because ""I was acting like a big baby"". Emotional abuse is real and after reading this book, my feelings were validated. For anyone second guessing themselves on what emotional abuse is, feels like, how is effects or behaviors of an abuser. This book reassured me I wasn't a big baby but a victim. I will be a victim no more--the healing has begun."
4,"Great Fun, Silly good time music.","Perfect CD for summer road trips, backyard summer BBQs or just to lighten up a grey winter day. Contains classic novelty songs that seem quite fresh again after all these years. Keep Splashin'!"
1,A Tiresome Leftwing Screed,"This tiresome leftwing screed would be funny if it were not so poorly written and badly researched. The book is presented as a debunking of the SDI concept and a refutation of the idea that it contributed to the fall of the Soviet Empire. The book really is a window into the tortured mind of the left, and how their denial of Reagan's role in destroying the Soviet Empire is as crazy as those people who deny the Holecoust. Technical inaccurancies riddle this little rant, which along with selective quotes and scurrilous conclusions condemn the book to be an embarssment rather than a contribution to the history of the 80s.--Mark R. (...)"
1,Does not work with latest generation of ipod Nano,"This charger will not charge the latest versions of the ipod Nano. I kind of figured it would. I don't know, maybe I missed something in the description, but that sucks."
4,Tampa Boy,The book was 6 on a scale of 10 but needs to be updated to 2013 .. Format is old black and white pic ect
3,good bad and ugly,"This album stays about as consistant as a junkie trying to give up drugs. Some songs are hardcore and then the next is pop-punk piece of crap time. hats off to all of the afi songs, from wen they used to be good. big thumbs down to jugheads revenge ,guttermouth, one hit wonder, and most of the vandals songs. No one can badmouth t.s.ol but hey that is only one diamond surrounded by trash. Also notworthy is sloppy seconds, but anyone that thinks this is great punk-rock obviously has been listening to nofx and anti-flag a little too much."
2,Good idea but...,"The book Biblical Hebrew Text And Workbook 2nd Edition attempts to bring the students immediately into contact with the written text. While this may not be such a bad idea, the problem is that there are too many rules of grammar that have to be dealt with (and are not dealt with very well in my opinion) that it is confusing to the beginner. I bought this book after a first year seminary Biblical Hebrew class and while I am the first to admit that I am no expert in Biblical Hebrew, I cannot say that I would recommend this book to anyone. Anyone wanting to learn the language will be much better served by the Living Biblical Hebrew series by Randall Buth."
2,Resin Case,"This watch scratched very easily- almost mysteriously, in fact- against anything at all. I can almost leave a scratch with my fingernail, which says enough as it is about the hardness of the case of the watch. The second hand of the watch seems to be very inconsistent, and I've heard it skip several beats or speed up quite a bit, rendering this watch fairly inconsistent regarding it's main purpose: keeping time. You get what you pay for, I suppose."
4,Casio Analog,"It is a good clock, is very light, what does the comfortable. It is a clock that can be used in the day by day has a good appearance in the finished"
1,DISAPPOINTED CUSTOMER,"Hello,I'm very disappointed with this product. Upon delivery to Howard R Young Institute the battery was dead. Of course it is very difficult for my son to return the item and request another one."
1,watch received not working,The watch received today does not work. It could be either bad or out of battery. What should I do next?
4,cute,quite comfortable casual watch for everyday use easy to combine with a pretty supportive. received at a fairly fast since you make the purchase.
3,Fine watch but probably not for grown man,Product came quickly and in great condition but I was surprised to discover just how small the watch was.This is probably a great watch for a teen or preteen but the band isn't really long enough for the average man' wrist nor is the width of the watch or band. I would recommend measuring a watch you have and like before ordering a watch online.It looked funny on me (too small) and I'm not one to wear a giant watch by any means.Fine watch but not the right size for a man.
4,for a college class,This book was purchased as required reading for a class my husband is taking. He said it is interesting and thought provoking.
1,Rohto Ice was irritating and spicy,"I wish I read these reviews before mistakenly trying this eyedrop. I've been using ""cool"" eyedrops for years for comforting eyes in the morning and after Internet surfing. Last month, I bought Rohto Ice from a store of Japanese goods near Santa Monica. In first use, I couldn't believe this was an eyedrop; one drop made me feel as if a wrong chemical into my eye. This eyedrop was very irritating, spicy, causing tears and blurred vision for 20 minutes. I thought it might be just the first time. After few more trials, I got the same problem. Therefore I stopped use Rohto Ice and began searching online why. I found more victims. I suggest Rohto refund suffered customers."
1,Beware Contact Users,"I just tried this Rohto stuff because when I'm not wearing my contacts, my eyes feel very dry, itchy, and are red. So I just took my contacts out, waited a few minutes, and put a drop of Rohto in one eye and I've been crying and wishing I could tear my eye out ever since. The pain!!! It said not to use when wearing contacts, but apparently contact users shouldn't use it even after the contacts are out. There's no cooling here, ALL PAIN."
5,Everyone should know these skills!,"This book should be required reading for everyone, regardless of field or relationship status. If you encounter a friend, relative, or stranger with something on their mind, this book shows you the steps you can take to help that person find the solutions to their own problems, a skill we all have within us. I use the skills in this book as a psychology student, a parent, and someone in long-term relationships with family, friends, and loved ones. If you can't afford the new copy, find an old one. This book will improve how you connect with others tremendously!"
2,Not a restful cd,This songbird cd is uneven in the sound volume of each cut. It also has birds whose songs are not really pleasant such as crows. There was no pleasant flow of bird songs. It was disappointing and I threw it away.
5,KD's Best Work Yet,"I have been a devotional singer for many years and have most everything that is available. I have all of KD's other releases and ""Live on Earth"" is his best work yet and I don't normally like live performances. With the exception of a few live ""mistakes"" that would normally be edit out, you wouldn't know this was a live CD.LOE has both a perfectly balanced devtional and energetic feel to it which is the sign of a good kirtan/bhajan. Even my Indian devotional singing friends who are usually very picky when it comes to devotional music, all love ""Live on Earth"". Most all of KD's good tracks from his other releases are on LOE so with this you have his best. If you have only one KD CD, this is the one."
1,A Bland Version of Pilgrim Heart........lack luster & dull,"I love Krishna Das's music, but this cd left me disappointed. The songs and vocals are overall flant and uninspiring. I highly reccommend his cd Pilgrim Heart, it is a true chant masterpiece. Bypass Live on earth...."
5,Captivating,"Being a Massachusetts native, I have always been fascinated by the witch trials in Salem. This book covers the subject in amazing detail. The research is in-depth and the writing thoroughly entertaining."
1,He Should Have Stayed with History,"Demos used an Inter-Disciplinary approach to writing this book. It resulted in a book that is dull and boring. Demos utilized Biography, History, Psychology, and Sociology in an attempt to better understand the witch crazes that periodically swept New England in the 17th century. Psychology is a load of garbage and Sociology is not much better. Demos should have kept his focus on his area of expertise: History. He focused on other outbreaks of witch hysteria other than Salem in 1692, and this proved to the book's only strong point. Salem is the best known outbreak of mass hysteria relating to witchcraft in Colonial America, but it was not the only one. Some outbreaks were simply accusations against 1 or 2 people at most. Other outbreaks may have seen several people accused, but not on the scale of Salem. I give this book a ""1-star"" rating simply because Amazon does not have one for ""0-star"" books."
1,shit game of the year,first of all let me tell you that the game is a rip off and why you ask ok frist the game come's in DVD-ROM and what happen's if you don't have a dvd-rom tough for the buyer ok most people have the late'ts mode's like Pent III to pent 4 computer and the best graph's card but my best tip for all people is to bye a PS2 OR XBOX XBOX-360 and at lest you don't get your computer crashing when playing games on it
4,Awesome,"I found this game well worth the video card I had to go invest into run it and the hassle to install it, which, all in all, was quite a lot. The gameplay is really fun although frustrating as heck sometimes (Being kicked off roofs by agents, being thrown about to the point of death by 4 Smith clones....). But I'm a rabid Matrix fan so I guess I'm kind of biased. I recommend playing as Ghost when you play since he has more entertaining, yet somewhat harder, tasks. And just a note people--Do NOT buy this game if you don't have a Radeon 8500 or GeForce 256 or higher video card. It just causes lots of aggravation and hassle. But all in all this is one of the best video games I've ever played. The live action video clips are pretty entertaining an the game fills in lots of holes in Reloaded. My only problem is that the game is over to quick! I played for 7 hours and was done. That was a little disappointing"
1,It could have been more fun...,"Enter the Matrix isn't a terrible game, but it is sort of a rip-off of Max Payne with some of the neat time-slowing tricks you can do. Another problem is that it crashed repeatedly on my desktop. And also I could only get the sound to work about a third of the times I played it. I might try playing it again now that I have a newer video card, but so far I'm not sure if even that will fix the no-sound buisiness. No patch has been released yet. If one has and I don't know about it shout it out at me! I would have given this game three stars if I didn't have these sound and crashing issues.In the end, the movies were wayyyyyyy better."
3,It works,"I needed a match for some cabinets that I purchased 2 years ago as floor models. Upon installing the cabinets finally, I realized I needed some handles and I was glad to find them on AMAZON of all places. I was a bit supprised about the price of these but I really had no choice because all the rest of the cabinets had these same ones. Upon recieveing the knobs, I can understand the price...they is a substantial amount of copper with the pewter center spans. I'm happy with them."
5,Another Great CD by Lifehouse,"Like their previous 3 cd's, Who We Are by Lifehouse is a great pop/rock cd! I don't think it will disappoint new or old fans.In my opinion, this cd is one of their best, probably my favorite next to their first- No Name Face. The melodies and lyrics of their music are unbeatable, you can't get them out of your head (in a good way!). And when they sing a meloncholy song, it's absolutely magic. However, specifically this cd has more upbeat songs, compared to the others. If you like ""First Time"", I think you'll like the rest of the cd. Some of my favorites (other than First Time) are: Disarray, Whatever It Takes, Who We Are, Broken, Easier to Be, Make Me Over, Mesmerized...actually, it's very hard to pick just a few!I saw Lifehouse in concert with the Goo Goo Dolls and just loved them live, nearly as much as I did the first time I saw them in 2001. I've been a huge fan for years and always recommend them to friends."
4,music,fell in love with a song on this cd the price was awesome the quality was fantastici will so recommend this to ther
5,What a masterpiece Lifehouse has done it again.,"All the songs on this CD totally rock, can't stop listening to them. thier last Cd was good it was kind of a more slow version of lifehouse which I like, this one is really good all around, its kind of like all thier styles of music put together. the song writing is really good as always, the kind of songs that really make you think, and that actually mean something. Which alot of other artist lack extremely. the music rocks I love how they change the sound of every song. My favorites are Whatever it Takes, Broken, First Time, Mesmerized, Who We Are, oh who am i kinding I like them all. The vocals are out of this world. If you want to listen to real music buy this CD."
5,Magical,"I read this years ago, when it first came out. I was a working in a bookstore. It came in and had a blurb on it from Annie Dillard. So, I decided to try it. I was entranced."
3,Just OK...,"This was a good book but i really wasn't impressed. This book is about claudia and how her new babysitting charges are prejudiced. They are named the Lowells and they get claudia as a sitter. Mrs. Lowell doesn't really approve of claudia but doesn't say why. She calls the BSC again and asks for anyone but claudia. they send jessi. Jessi doesn't even sit for them. Mrs. Lowell slams the door in her face. This is a sad book that is sort of slow-moving, however, it is a pretty good book. It has a not-so-good ending, though. The Lowells are still prejudiced. I would tell you more, but why give away the ending?? :) I think most people will enjoy Babysitter's Club: Keep Out, Claudia!"
5,Pleased for the price.,I was pleasantly surprised at the effectiveness of this small compact vacuum for the price. It works great for small jobs in the vehicle. It's compact enough to carry around in the trunk for quick clean-up.
5,Exquisite Form bra,I have been wearing these bras for at least 20 years. They are the only ones that are comfortable and give me the support I need. I wouldn't wear anything else!
5,exquisite fully support bra,"I am always satisfied with this bra. Have tried many different styles, but always go back to exquisite form"
1,Such a disappointment,This bra derives all it's support from the straps. There is no support in the band as there should be. I guess this is why the large felt pads are on the straps. This is 100% cotton? The straps were so rigid and light it felt more like cardboard. Bra seemed to run true to size.
2,Just OK,Book is just ok. A lot of the information is just common sense. The only reason I bought it was because it was required for a class that I was taking.
4,A cook's peeler,This is the third Kyocera ceramic blade peeler I've purchased. Excellent product. Only problem with wider 'wishbone' is it does not hold the blade in place when peeler thicker skins like cucumber. it is easy to snap back into place but I'm sure that the more times it pops out the more that post hole will wear.
5,Micro blows us away again :),Hands up to Micro for putting together yet another amazing set. The continuous flow of hard-edged trance this CD presents blew me away the first time I listened to it. Definitely worth the money!
1,NOT LEATHER!,"WARNING: this is labeled as Leather and it most definitively is NOT! Not even good vinyl! I returned mine. I have bought others from Planet Waves and they are of acceptable, nearly decent quality. I would not trust any of them after this."
5,Love this music!,"I choose this rating because the cd was exactly what I wanted and this musical group is fantastic. The vibe is great and the lead singer has a deep soulful voice, so what's not to like? I have recommended this cd to many people."
1,Not So Good,I was hoping for something to reduce the volume while maintaining pitch. This product doesn't do that. The seams on mine came apart on the second day -- I had to sew it back together. I do not recommend this product.
4,cool pocket knife,This was a great gift for Men in my family thay loved it!!! It has a beautiful picture on it!!
2,Ramonas review,Its a really good book do everyone should read it its so supper di dooper good so read it read it and read it
4,"At first i didnot like this cd,But now i truely enjoy listening to it.","When i first bought Aly & A.j's CD ""Insomniatic"" I thought it was horrible and was ready to return it,but one of my friends had it and said the cd was great and to give it another try.Well all i can say is i am glad i did.I think the songs are good and i enjoy listening to them.Although this cd is not as great as there first cd""Into The Rush""(which i enjoyed from the first time i listened to it)""Insomniatic""is still a great cd and is well worth the money."
4,No Sleeping Here,"I bought this for my daughters (8 and 10), but have to say this is brilliant pop....great lyrics, tunes and those perfectly complementary sister voices which can rock, pop or sing sweetly.Surprisingly wonderful!"
5,Mic cable,Perfect extension for small room studio. Connection is great resulting in great sound quality. The cable is sturdy not cheap.
3,Mr Wong DVD,"While it's certainly racially incorrect it is indicative of the era for the portrayal of Asians as played by Caucasians. If you can get past that it is watchable for the genre. However the last of the six films does not have Bois Karloff in the lead and does use Keye Luke in the title role which was way ahead of it's time, but certainly much more believable. Now, if they only had better plot lines...... of course these were not made as A list movies so you need to watch them for what they are. Before TV escapism with a touch of the ""mysterious Eastern atmosphere""."
1,"Shamefully, embarassingly bad, awful movie","on any level of description, this is an atrociously bad movie, acting is ridiculous, camera work is silly, plot is silly,no redeeming features whatsoevermade with men and material support of Philippine armed forces, what a waste, must have been some sort of a tax dodge, reminds me of the rationale for springtime for hitler, make something so bad, it is bound to fail"
3,Pretty good for its time,"I imagine in 1968 this movie was really cool. That being said, it's seems kinda crappy in 2011. You have to take it for what it is: a freaking old movie. It's on Netflix, so don't waste your money buying it. If you're interested in other old war films, Netflix is the way to go."
2,"Beach Red, Low Budget WWII","A low budget, poorly-made film. The acting, except for Rip Torn, is laughable. The battle scenes have some vigor to them, but don't make much sense. In all, the picture owes more to the Vietnam War era than WWII. Perhaps film buffs point to this film because it was one of the first WWII films to show the war in some graphic detial (bloody bullet wounds, shot-off arms and legs, etc) and it follows the travails of the foot-soldier, rather than the generals. It's like bad Sam Fuller, which means, really, really low budget. The voice-overs and flashbacks are indeed very reminiscent to Mallick's technique in THIN RED LINE, although in BEACH RED, the effect is mostly silly. In sum, the effect is mostly bogus, somehow exploitive, and impossible to watch without a fast-forward button."
4,Fantastic movie about Marines in the Pacific.......,"For a movie shot in the 60's, I was amazed at how well made this film is. There is none of the ""Hurrah! Let's move out, men!"" flag waving nonsense that many similiar films had in the 50's and 60's. This movie is a hardcore look at the horrors of war...for both sides. Shot in a documentary style, Beach Red starts off with a Marine landing and storming of the beach. After the Marines make their way into the jungle, they must eliminate machine gun nests and snipers. As our troops continue into the heart of the island, we begin to see flashbacks of their home life before the war. Terrance Malick's The Thin Red Line borrowed heavily from this movie (this film is actually more graphic). This movie that I had never heard of instantly joined my top ten list for great war films. I also rented Ambush Bay the same week and enjoyed that one as well (for different reasons of course). I hope MGM has some more hidden WW2 treasures out there."
1,Not very engrossing!,"My favorite author is Carol's, Mary Higgins Clark. There is no comparison at all between them. When I read (and I have read them ALL) Mary's books, I can't wait to get to the next chapter; I am on the edge of my seat. Carol's books are more boring, especially this one. I couldn't wait to finish it just because I thought it might get more interesting, not because of an engrossing plot. Another review said it best, it should be for a young child to read."
3,Twanged,"I just finished this trendy, witty who-done-it. Ms. Clark's character's may be a bit shallow, but aren't most people. I found it delightfully light reading which is why I read it. Ms. Reagan Rily the whimsical P.I. is a bit more lady-like than some of her contemporaries but she steps up when it is deserving. I look forward to her next effort."
3,"nice, but this was a companion guide and purchased used IIRC with no Master Text.",so ultimately it was not as helpful even as a review as buying a complete college textbook on thisfascinating subject. I think i gave it to a woman i know who got a degree in this field.
2,This was whack...,"This joint was not funny. I was really surpised at how boring Mike Epps was. I loved him in Friday but after seeing this on HBO I was dissapointed. The crowd in the audience looked I looked at home, bored."
2,Not as good as it could have been,"This book seems to be a lot like a B-24. It takes a long time to take off, but once it does, it's fairly interesting. I don't mind learning a little about where some of the B-24 airmen came from and the training they went through, but Ambrose throws a long list of airmen, that other than McGovern and his crew you almost never see again. I agree with other reviewers, his other books are much better. I think it would have been more interesting to go into more detail with just McGovern and his crew and avoid some of the other things that slow this book down."
3,Much to be desired...,"Considering that this is an Ambrose work, I was a little disappointed. It is a very short and quick read compared to some of his other works, and there's just not a lot to it. There are some good stories and a basic overview of the strategic bombing in Europe but I was hoping for more. It left much desired. Will suffice as a first look into the World War II bombing, but not any sort of reference work."
3,Disappointed,"Given Ambrose's previous work, I was extremely disappointed with this book. I thought that the writing style was brief and choppy. I believe that a much more detailed and profound story could have been told instead. I would recommend reading Band of Brothers or Pegasus Bridge instead."
2,Disappointing,"The book read more like an advertisement for George McGovern than anything else. I understand that he is a friend of the author, but the clear favoritism and decidedly narrow focus spoiled the book. Very few characters besides McGovern were developed beyond their introduction and the time-line felt choppy, jumping between places and events without continuity or transition. I did learn some things I hadn't been aware of, but for the most part the book was well worth passing on in favor of other options.The Candy Bombers: The Untold Story of the Berlin Airlift and America's Finest Hourproved a vastly better alternative."
1,Disappointing flop,"Who would have thought that the guy who gave us ""D-DAY"" and ""Citizen Soldier"" could have cranked out a disappointment such as this? This is an autobiography of McGovern, and nothing more. Little research or effort went into this book and I actually suspect someone other than Ambrose wrote it. I've read everything else by Ambrose and this ""ain't"" him.For those who are looking for a good read about the Lib and the crews who flew her just check out ""Log of the Liberators"". There are many other good books out there on the B-24 that do the crews justice. Don't go ""here"" just because it's Ambrose. To be quite frank: If ""he"" did indeed write this book he should stop while he's ahead. Ambrose, INC. dropped the ball here."
2,Kinda long winded,Decent book but it seems to go on a bit too much for me...almost feels like the author dragged it out a bit to fill more pages.
2,Stephen Ambrose?,I read this book a couple of years ago. While the overall story was interesting I remember being very unimpressed by the writing style.I just pulled the book out again and went through a couple of chapters. Sorry to say but the quality of writing is very simple and not nearly up to the standard of Ambrose's other books.I'm wondering if he really wrote it - or had it subcontracted out.
2,Mr. Mc Govern's book.,"I have read better books by Stephen Ambrose(or his team of writers...). This one is dull, tiringsome, centered in one person. Ok the guy was supposed to be charismatic in spite of not wining a presidential election long ago forgotten.Books of this kind, i.e. One motor , one wing and a prayer are far better. Don't waist your money and time."
2,Disappointed....,"Rather than what we expected, this book was too much about George McGovern and not as well written as Mr. Ambrose's previous efforts."
2,The Jump Is Lame,"Mattel took a lot of artistic creativity with the illustration. The little part that launches the vehicles doesn't have much power; the jump is barely noticeable. It's a roadway, but it's not radical."
4,Solid Power Metal that Impresses,"Where did these guys come from? This CD is powerful and showcases some top notch songwriting. Aside from the occasionally muddled production, this is a solid listen. The songwriting is very good and the lyrics are as well. This is true power metal at it's best. The guitars are good, especially the guitar harmonies and harmony leads in several of the songs. The vocalist had to grow on me but he does an excellent job. My favorite songs are ""Black Watch"" which is a stunning instrumental, ""Kinescope"", ""Crusade"" and ""Scape Goat"". Most of the songs are good though. About the only negatives I have regarding this CD are the muddled drums in some spots and the overall production. However, seeing as how it is a debut CD, that can be overlooked. It really is a good slab of traditional metal and I seriously recommend it for anyone who likes Iron Maiden, Queensryche (debut to Mindcrime era), Judas Priest, Dream Theatre, Fates Warning, etc."
4,lyrical rhythmic prose,"Awesome awesome awesome! I loved the lyrics, the drum mix is incredible. The band plays with heart, definately money well spent, I haven't played an album over and over since high school. I'm wearing this one out.."
5,Train Master,Kept me and my 3 1/2 year old grandson entertained. We can't wait for Train Master II to come out. Good job director and producer.
3,Bananas are great!,"In my experience, these kind of items that are supposed to taste like certain foods usually don't. I love strawberries, but I don't like these strawberry condoms. I like oranges, but I don't like these orange condoms. I like bananas, and I do like these banana condoms. A great alternative to tasting something else in your mouth! I've decided to buy just the banana in bulk on ebay. The condoms themselves are durable. I highly recommend."
3,"Nice features, not fantastic quality.","I bought this as a gift for my husband, the watch was large on him but we took it to our local walmart and had them remove the links (free of charge) Problem for me is that the watch face scratch way to easily. The only time he will wear the watch is when he knows it will be covered by a sleeve. kind of disappointing."
4,Solid Resource,"I have quickly come to appreciate this series of commentaries/sermons as a great help in my sermon preparation from week to week, and for my own edification. I greatly appreciate the basic commitments of this series: that the Church should take Scripture seriously (their view on Scripture is solidly evangelical), and that verse-by-verse exposition and application is a phenomenal--if not the primary--way of engaging people with God's revelation and will.Among the books in this series I have read, this one may not be the most helpful. Most every chapter was very helpful in gaining understanding of the text, and ways in which they may apply to the contemporary Christian. But there were times when chapters were predicable, though by no means unbiblical.As a series I heartily recommend Preaching the Word, and if you are looking for a good ""application"" resource on Colossians and Philemon, this would be a great addition to your shelf."
3,Very Good Book,Great spiritual novel about the daily temptation we face woven into a fictional love story. Beautiful story...excellent message.
5,A Must Read,I had heard a lot about this book before I actually read it. It was everything that I heard plus more. This book grabs you from page 1 and carries you to the end. I was most impressed with the scriptures that are interwovened throughout the book. The book was definitely written by someone who knows the bible. The storyline is timely when marriages are being tested all the time. I can't wait for the next book by Ms. Murray. God Bless You!
4,Wonderfully written but,"Although this book was awesome, I must say I was a little disappointed with the beginning--such a wordly birthday party. In addition, I believe the book could minister to others in different ways, such as Kyla having a discussion with Jasmine. Pastor Ford should have mentioned Kyla and Jasmine's relationship in their counseling. While Jefferson's adulterous relationship with Jasmine was not Kyla's fault, I think Pastor Ford should have made Kyla face the role she played in this as well. Jasmine was not discreet in her actions. Again, not to take anything from the novel, I truly enjoyed it and look forward to reading other books by Mrs. Murray."
4,GREAT BOOK!!,"I really enjoyed this book, it represents the many facets of life that person will face. The good, the bad and the ugly! This book lets us know that though we as Christians will face troubles in this life... GOD will bring us out and turn tragedy around for good!"
1,Trifling Dribble,"... that about sums it up! Predictable, bugeois, staged, swill. Please, please my people - just because it's an African-American author does not mean you have to read this mess!"
1,Lousy plastic parts,"Disappointing. Lousy fitting of plastic parts. Looks like it was adapted from some other switch. I'll be replacing this with something of better quality. It was cheap, and I got what I paid for >>> Cheap."
4,A good story from a youth turning into an adult,"Thisis a good story from a kid who recognises the mistake of getting engaged to a gitrl just befoer going for a tour in Vietman. a Sniper the work has only jjust begun to be ecognised as a'artillary' for Grunts, thisis shown as is the poor morale the inability to grasp what is goin gon by the american publec and a strong mother to keep him sane.I lik ethe action bits. Sound soldiers with a good morale code, still I would use silver tipped bullets, what's the difference if you going to kill someone?A good story, honetly told."
5,The best textbook I have used,"These books are for the serious learner who intends master the language. Lots of time and effort are required, but it will pay off enormously. I used these books in college and now am in Japan. They use a variety of methods to instill the patterns of grammer. They also teach Kanji at a reasonable pace. Do not buy these books for a quick fix approach. They take you through every step necessary to fully master the basics."
5,"Sammy, Sammy,Sammy................","Sam just doesn't stop making great music, unlike a couple of brothers who can't seem to do anything. I won't waste any time saying how great all the songs are. I just wanted to comment on a couple. The first one is HALLALUJAH. Listen to the guitar work after the chorus. Sounds like something Sam learned from Ed, very loud and filling so to speak. Though I believe the VH brothers are the reason for the split, it has madeSam that much better. THE BIG SQUARE INCH is the other song I wanted to touch base on. If I were a betting man, I would say that was Michael Anthony helping Sam dish out those lyrics. If you are a true fan you will not be disappointed. Thanks Sammy!"
2,"OK As Far As It Goes, Which Is Not Very","As with most of the Re/search product of recent years (Swing, anyone), this seems to be a rather hastily put together attempt to cash in on a trend (In retrospect, many of the earlier Re/Search publications seem to have been calculated to capitalize on such trends, but they were much better put together). Apparently, editor Vale's unwillingness to pay contributors with more than promises of future payment have left him without the input of those who were essential to Re/Search's few worthwhile books.Had an attempt been made to get a more complete overview of ""Modern Pagans,"" this might be of more than passing interest to readers other than the acquaintances of the interviewees. The obvious rush to get this product on the shelves pretty much sinks it, however."
5,One of The Best Baseball Bios,"The book covers all phases of Musial's life, including his personal life and post-baseball life. Unlike many baseball bios, it covers some weaknesses in the personal characteristics of this great star, although there were very few in Musial. What I especially liked about the book is that the author contacted and obtained interesting information from numerous former major league players and others who knew Musial. The author had apparently written letters to more than 500 former major leaguers.I couldn't put the book down. I'd rate it even better than the recent book I read about Ted Willimas, which I rated as the best baseball bio I had ever read. Stan Musial was my favorite ball player wehn I was growing up in the 1950s, and I wasn't disappointed.If anything, I would have liked to hear even more about Musial's post baseball life, although there's a lot in the book. However, I understand Stan did not cooperate with the author."
5,Tess knocks another one out of the park!,"Even if you are not up to speed on medical jargon (althought there's a limited amount of it in this book) you will throrougly enjoy the way Tess builds the plots and subplots of this excellently created medical thriller. I fully expect to see THE SURGEON made into a motion picture - - if somebody in Hollywood has the good sense to buy the rights. Keep on crankin' 'em out, Tess. You've got an ever increasing following of readers out here. We all love you, especially we who hail from the great State of Maine. Steven L. Waterman (author of JUST A SAILOR)"
3,Not bad . . . but is that enough?,"The Surgeon isn't a bad read and it isn't a great read - it is exactly an average (3 star) read. Maybe it was her ""typical characters"" i.e. the headstrong and competent female physician, the moral and wise male detective who is still mourning the loss of his wife, the female cop who feels hurt and left out because she has always been considered ""just a girl"", and so on; but this book gave me a sense of deja vu and read pretty much as I expected it would. In its defense, it did move along quickly and kept my attention - I wanted to keep reading it even though I knew I would not be surprised or encounter anything new - in sum, it kept me entertained. So if you are looking for a little bit of entertainment - here you go - this book is for you. If you are looking for something with a bit more depth - look elsewhere."
4,A great book,This book kept me guessing at the outcome. The plot was quite winding and very interesting as well as a little frightening. I enjoyed this and all the Rizzoli and Isles books. It's quite different that the TV series.
2,The Surgeon was disappointing.,I have read all of Gerritsen's books and always look forward to her new ones. I couldnt finish this book. She has veered from her fascinating medical thriller format to this slice and dice psychotic murderer format and Im so disappointed.
3,"Great writer, good story","Compared to previous works, this endeavor doesn't compliment Ms. Gerritsen's usually high standards in story-telling and inventiveness, as previously displayed in Gravity or Bloodstream. Rather, this seemed just another proto-typical, scripted psychotic killer story so prevalent lately. It doesn't cover new ground or stretch her writing skills, but seems to be an appeal to satisfy the masses with a quick money-maker. The story seemed so hastily contrived that I'm not even certain I understand the motivation behind the killings and the choice of ""trophy"".On the plus side, Ms. Gerritsen's writing prose is always easy to read and entertaining and this edition certainly offered more of the same. I just was expecting more of her excellence."
2,Gruesome.,"It's always a shame to see a good writer use bad material. This author describes the vivisection of a woman in great detail four times before moving on to the next victim, who dies the same way and gets the same detailed descriptions. If you enjoy thoughts of hurting women, this is your thing. It isn't mine.Two stars instead of one because the author has talent. Two stars instead of five because she cops out with very cheap material."
5,A great book,I loved this book It has suspense a little romance. I can't wait to read the apprentice.
2,Not this time around,"As a long time fan of Ms Gerritsen, I was really looking forward toThe Surgeon, alas it was a big disappoint and ever so predictable. The characters were good but story line was just not up to her usual standard."
5,Sucks the Air Out of You!,"I sampled this book on Kindle and bought it immediately. Gerritsen pulled me in, scared me, shocked me and most importantly, entertained me. I highly recommend this medical thriller/police procedural to all mystery lovers. The author's background as an M.D. added a gritty layer that kept me turning the pages."
4,Creepy good suspense!,"If you like crime novels, this one will surely not disappoint. From the very beginning, it's hard to put this novel down.The unexpected twists further draw you into the story line, and even when you're completely freaked out; want to put the book down because you're wondering, ""What is that rapping on the window outside?"", you keep going. I liked this book a lot. My only complaint was that the ending, though climactic, was a tad soft and abrupt."
5,A must have!,"I was blown away with this DVD set. It's filled with simple to complex techniques on lighting, lenses, composition, etc. I have studied fine art but never understood photography until now. Who should watch these DVD's? nearly everyone interested in improving their photographic artistry. It's amazing. The instructor, Manny, specialize in people photography so for those who are interested in taking photos of children, children in action, families, weddings, college dorms, people having fun outdoors, .... you will especially enjoy many of the techniques demonstrated here. I have purchased books, DVD's, on line courses, etc. and none of them had the amount of concise, useful information as these DVD's. Try them. You will be glad you did."
2,OK - but only 4 gigabit ports,"I shouldn't have purchased this - it only has 6 gigabit ports. The title of the item was written in such a way that confused me. I thought it was a straight gigabit switch, but 80% of the ports are only 10/100."
2,No code until Chapter 15 of 21,There are several problems with this book. The author fails to give step by step instuctions for his examples instead he expects you to follow along from previos chapters and string the examples along. Also he uses MySQL as the example database. I and many other people use MS Access for development and this makes it tougher for the begginer to get started. Third there is no source code or sample databases for the reader to try out along with the book until chapter 15 and then still no database examples. Its very hard to follow along unless the code is provided. The CD that came with the book is basically useless and I don't know why he included some worthless graphics in it. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because his writing style is OK and does contain some usefull info about Ultradev but it fails as a learning tool.
5,Elvis does it again!!!,"Ignore the ""racist"" rubbish that inevitably gets posted by those with a chip on their shoulder and listen to the music - IT Kicks BUTT!!!! I also can not believe this did not get the airplay it deserved, especially after hitting no. 1 in a squillion different countries around the world.By the way, BB King, James Brown and Muhummud Ali were Elvis' friends. I don't think they would appreciate being called fools, not to mention the late Sammy Davis Jnr and Jackie Wilson (who's hospital bills Elvis paid for by the way after his stroke - not exactly the actions of a racist)"
1,"ELVIS HAS LEFT THE BUILDING, JXL SHOULD TOO!","What's next, a hip-hop version of ""Jailhouse Rock"" with an all-star rap interlude? (Yes RCA, u can use that! Just don't say where u got the idea -- some of us still respect the man's musical legacy and r offended by kitsch-fests designed to make a quick buck. Congrats, guys - the Colonel would be proud)."
5,Another #1 For the KING,"For the most part, I don't like the idea of someone ""jacking"" around with Elvis' music. JXL, however, did an excellent job of remixing ""ALLC"". It's great, it moves, and it remains ultimately faithful to the original. Actually, I think the only thing wrong with the original was that it was WAY too short and ended too abruptly. My only complaint with the remix would be the sound effects: unnecessary. But the song is great nonetheless, and it's fantastic to see the KING back at the top of the singles charts. LONG LIVE THE KING!!"
4,In Glorious Black and White!,"King Features and Turner Broadcasting should be ashamed of themselves for not releasing the classic black-and-white Popeye cartoons on video. However, seven Popeye shorts fell into the public domain and now are showcased in this fine collection, along with the Technicolor two-reelers from 1936 to 1939. Three of the B&W cartoons - ""The Paneless Window Washer"" (1937), ""I Never Changes My Altitude"" (1937) and ""A Date to Skate"" (1938) - are among Max and Dave Fleischer's best efforts. Highly recommended."
5,Don't neglect this one!,"I realize that the official Popeye Vol. 1 collection is coming out in a week or so, and have pre-ordered it...but don't let that dissuade you from getting this or any of the Thunderbean releases. They are very thoughtfully compiled, priced very reasonably...and always have great liner notes and/or extras. so even if you order the official one...this is a worthy addition and companion."
5,Bamboo Delight,"My husband and i are delighted with the tea set. It is smaller than we thought and doesn't hold much tea. But the quality, color and appearance are beautiful and make any tea ceremony or tea talk special."
4,It sits on my Web design reference shelf,I found this book cleanly and clearly explains how to integrate frames into web design. Examples and illustrations reenforce how to do things. I've looked at it more than a few times to check things when I am working.
1,poor quality,"After assembling the fountain, struggling with screws that didn't quite line up, filled it and turned it on.Within two days the middle slate piece began to crack and crumble at one corner eventually breaking off.Contacted the distributor who told us to file a claim with Amazon"
2,Parts Missing,"Had to return since parts were missing. It was not a new product. Received in refurbished box, dirty stones, parts missing. Very disappointed. And it is old metal."
1,Useless,"There isn't any other way of putting it - but useless. I had this for a while in case of emergencies. Well, today I tried to use it for the most simplest of tasks, taking the remaining two gallons of water from my aquarium. I would have been better off with a plastic tube, and some capillary effect - this thing didn't take a single drop through it. The only benefit from this device, if you want to call it that, is the guy that manufacturers it, and the companies that buy it for 25 Cents, and resell it for way more than it's worth are sitting pretty with the profits while we get frustrated. Save your money, time, and patience - stay away from this product!"
1,Does not work,"I had two of these and never got either of them to work. IF curiosity gets the better of you and you just 'gotta' try it, buy it locally where you don't have to pay Shipping & Handling (both ways) to return it.Pump #1 had no obvious flaws other than it just didn't suck oil.Pump #2 self destructed, spitting plastic shards through both hoses. Could easily damage the engine your trying to maintain."
5,Emergency Season Four,Emergency Season Four is a great dvd I have really enjoyed watching all the episodes. I highly reccomend this dvd. This is tv from a simpiler time nothing contoversial just great entertainment like it should still be.
3,Emergency Season 4 - Substandard Quality,"Pulling a DVD out of the pack, the first thing you notice is the solid purple ""design"". Looked very cheap to me - they could have at least put an image.The quality of the episodes varied widely. Image quality was very poor in some episodes with noticeable fluttering and video artifacts. Sound quality was also poor in a few cases with the dialog barely audible, forcing me to crank volume to max, then quickly back down again due to the sirens.For the price, they could and should have put more time/effort into the product."
5,"Life Savers Gummies, Tangy Fruits, 7-Ounce Bag",This item I haven't been able to find anywhere in Texas! All the stores stopped carrying this flavor all of a sudden. I'm so glad I was able to find this on Amazon.com. I will be ordering from here from now on!Thanks!
5,Boo boo bee boo?,Pablo can do more voices than any comedian I've ever seen! His material is non-stop laughter and my friends and I can't get enough. I think Pablo will become a household name soon because he's a genius.
1,Damaged,"The video was damaged when it was delivered. Not only is the DVD bent, but scratched as well."
1,Don't get it!,"I chose to purchase this DVD based on other reviews, and that he received good reviews for his appearance on the Three Amigos DVD (comedy with Carlos Mencia/Freddy Soto). TOTALLY don't get how this got even 1 star...let alone 4 and 5! Maybe I'm just getting old! :) My 18 and 20 year old found it funny...but me and my husband just didn't get it."
5,Buy this book,I'm a first year medical student but have already begun using this book and the question/answer format is incredibly easy to use and time efficient. The topics in this book are taught in class and at the hospital (for the few times a week I am there).
4,Decent beginning book,I actually went to medical school where the author who was training in Trauma at the time. The book is mostly sourced from his and other classmates medical school notes.
2,An okay addendum to other study methods.,This book might be used to supplement other study guides you have used. It is far from complete and has many errors.Few of the questins were anything like ones I've seen on the tests.
1,This can't be a book for NT administrators.,This book is full of mistakes. Test questions will never be on exams. Microsoft will never ask you this kind of silly questions. Please stay away from this book. Forget of what other reviewers says.
4,The world to come,A very good book. Disquieting though. Her guides talk about the political figure that is the walk-in....Obama...? They still say in the wink of a eye the earth will turn on it's axis...but now not as much in the loss of life. FRIGHTENING TO THINK ABOUT
4,"Smooth, Sensual and Sensational!","Liza Lee is a native of Reading, Pennsylvania. She's been involved in music all her life, singing in church and other functions. ""Scarlet Mark"", her debut CD, is a culmination of all of her years in music study. Her music selection ranges from traditional jazz (Cole Porter, Hoagy Carmichael) to Rock and Pop (Bob Dylan, Ani DiFranco) and she handles the genres like a seasoned pro. I personally enjoyed the captivating covers of The Beatles' ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" (A version I found to be very sensual as well as smooth.), and Tori Amos' ""Cornflake Girl"". Her soothing voice will capture your soul. She's not overpowering in her delivery, but she not annoying, either. It's a very good debut that I highly recommend. Be on the look out for this up and coming star!"
5,A Gentle Pick-Me-Up,"Hearing Mary Black sing ""Say a Little Prayer for you"" is alone, worth the price of the album. With her paradoxically strong and innocent voice, she breathes new life into that exciting, sing-along song. Every time my ""random"" function on my CD player selects that song, I turn the volume up and sing along.But there are a lot more treats on this album. COLUMBUS, with its smooth rhythms and bright, expansive vocals puts me in the perfect mood for taking a road trip every time.The album is just one fun, tender, folk/pop gem after another. It isn't my number one favorite of Mary Black's albums, but if I ever lost it ... I'd replace it immediately. It's not only an essential ingredient in a Mary Black collection, but its subtle cheer is also an essential ingredient in the recipe for a good day."
2,"Fits well, but not built to last.","This cover was an excellent fit to my 2002 Prius. That's the good news. The bad news, this cover is not built to last. Within a couple of weeks of use, I've noticed places around the edges where it's wearing through. If you're not careful you can easily poke a finger through it. Water seeps through when it rains."
4,Encouraging Advice!,"This book is as chatty and inspiring as all of Berg's books. Reading her books is like having a conversation with a good friend over a hot cup of coffee. I love the fact that she did not start out in a career as a writer, but as a nurse with an interest in writing. I particularly enjoyed the writing exercises which were simple and direct. This one now has its place on my shelf next to ""Bird by Bird"" by Anne Lamott and ""Wild Mind"" by Natalie Goldberg. I'm looking forward to Ms. Berg's next book due out in July. I highly recommend this book and all of her fiction."
4,What an inspiration.....,"What a great book- easy to read and understand. If you are considering writing, for profit or fun, this book really helped me open up and let the ink flow- without me sensoring ever word before it hit the paper!"
5,sure to become a classic,"I am addicted to writing books. I have worn out copies of Anne Lamott's Bird By Bird and Natalie Goldberg's Writing Down the Bones, given away many other guides that didn't work for me, often because they were too prescriptive. I want to be encouraged to sit down and write, not told exactly how to do it. Elizabeth Berg's book is a keeper! I was hooked right from the beginning. I admire her honest, straight-forward and encouraging style and have enjoyed working through many of the exercises she suggests. I know I will be refering back to Escaping into the Open for many years. If you can only afford one book on writing...buy this one and save up for the other two."
3,nice CD,"The CD is in good condition as stated in the comment, but it would be better if stated it's a promotion copy rather than a retail version."
5,Great headlight,I purchased these to use on my Chevelle with HID bulbs. These lights are nicely made with a glass design that almost looks stock. A few things you should know before buying!- The glass is flat not curved like a factory sealed beam light.- They do not fit in the hi beam headlight bucket. The locating tabs are in the wrong spot. You might have to change the buckets or modify the light.- they do not come with bulbs. Ok for me since I used a HID kit.
1,Cheap Threads in seams,Very Cheap made pants seams started coming out the firts time I wore them Dont waste your money on these
2,The 1st-7th Grade Math tutor-7 Hour Course! 2 DVD Set,"I ordered this dvd for a ged student. It was supposed to include a lesson on proportions, however, it did not. The instructor had good knowledge of math, but the presentation/delivery was very boring."
2,The 1st-7th grade math tutor,"I bought this CD because my 2nd grader is quite bright and I wanted to teach him properly the concepts from advanced grades. I felt it would be more economical than going to an math enrichment company.The concept of this CD is very good. There is a ""teacher"" who goes through different math concepts. The only problem is his personal speaking style is quite annoying. First off he ends each sentence with ""you know"" and in addition the volume is extemely low. He goes through each problem very slowly so for a bright child like my 7 year old he lost his interest quickly. This CD would be great for a slow learner if this could keep his attention I would be surprised.Quite pricey too!"
5,Winterberry Emerald plate,"I ordered this as a replacement for the one that got broken after so many years of use. I love this plate as it goes with Grapevine, white Filigree, and Winterberry pattern plates that I have. This purchase gets me back to the 12 plates that I use every day."
5,Most informative travel magazine on the market!,"I have been a long-time subscriber of ""Islands"" magazine, which is similar to Conde Nast Traveler. One day I saw an issue of Conde Nast on the newsstand and decided to pick it up and have a look. Needless to say, I was impressed. I bought that issue and thoroughly enjoyed it. Then somehow I forgot about subscribing or buying the latest issue off the newsstand until a couple months ago, I found this listing here on Amazon. I immediately subscribed and have since received three issues. I can say that Conde Nast is far and away the ONLY decent travel magazine on the market today. The articles are outstanding, and the destinations are more exotic and more plentiful than what competition travel magazines cover. Bottom line is this - if you love to travel or are just starting to think about taking any kind of vacation for the first time, this magazine is a must have!"
1,Conde Nast Traveler Subscription Acknowledgement,"I ordered a two year subscription on 6/23/2007 -- a month ago. To date, I have not received any kind of acknowledgement from Conde Nast. Possibly this is normal, but it shouldn't be."
1,too many old issues,"They sent the December issue at the beginning of January to get rid of old stock, and the January issue on January 16 along with the February issue. I had hoped my subscription would consist of more timely issues, not late or out of date .Of course have read that Conde Nast is in trouble.Conde Nast Traveler (1-year)Valerie Crotty"
3,"Some good articles,, but disappointing","I have subscribed to Traveler for a while now. Before I picked up that subscription, I was already subscribing to National Geographic Traveler and Budget Travel. I have to say that for the average, middle-class person, Budget Travel is the most practical. I enjoy reading it the most because I want to know how to get a great deal . . . not how to get the most for your dollar in First Class. This magazine is definitely geared toward the more affluent traveler. It is also geared toward the sophisticated, chic traveler--not the average traveler. While it is interesting to read about places the wealthy are able to afford and dream about going there, I would rather a magazine cater more to my tastes and more toward the tastes of its general subscription population."
4,Give it a chance,"I really enjoyed this book and have continued to read the whole series. Admittedly it is difficult to get into but if you stick with it it will be worth your while. But i do recomend that some of the writing might be a bit gory in parts for some people, but if you like Magic, War and Suspence this is the book for you!"
2,I'm not sure about this one...,"I am a die hard Firehouse fan and find this addition to their collection disappointing...the worst yet. If you truly love all their prior efforts, you might find this one very sad as I did. More misses than hits to me. ""Perfect Lie"", IMO, is the best song on this album period. Just let CJ Snare sing all the songs next time guys...."

3,it's ok,I'm sure this will get five star from a Bob the builder fan but my son is not so much in it. He likes watching thomas videos. He doesn't really understand all the conversations. It is not clearly said or they talk to fast for him. My son is four and loves the Thomas collection better.
3,Grieving For a Lost Brother,"Mr. Dornstein searches for his brother he feels he never knew. I knew of someone in my own life who did the same exact thing. Someone who even took his own brother's name and went to his brother's old haunts and hung out with his brother's old friends. The grieving process takes time. I think that is what this book is really about. We all grieve in our own way. We have to walk it out in our own way, and pay tribute to the ones we loved and lost. Our pain won't go away until we do that. Reguardless of whether others understand that or not. Grief has it's own time. For some it takes longer. I don't know if Mr. Dornstein feels his relationship is now complete with his brother. I hope now he has closure."
1,This phone ringer is not at all loud,"This phone ringer is not loud at all, we purchased this phone ringer for my fathers barn, so he could hear the phone ring over the farm equipment when we are working on it, the fact is the ringer is not loud and as a matter of fact the ringer on the regular telephone is much louder than this ringer!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY,This CD sucks..plain and simple. Honestly I thought for a second I bought the power rangers movie soundtrack by accident
5,Wonderful tutorial,"I haven't got much to add to the previous reviews, this DVD is fantastic. I do have one additional piece of information that might help non-US purchasers, though. According to the amazon.com product information, this DVD is region 1 encoded and won't play outside the US and Canada. In fact, I put it into a region 4 only DVD player and it played straight away without my having to alter the region setting, which is definitely set to 4. So I don't think this DVD has any region encoding. At least, not the one they sent me!"
1,WARNING: THIS PROGRAM DIES AFTER ONE YEAR!,"I enjoyed using Zagat to Go for a year. Then the program refused to run. When I contacted Zagat, I was told that the program was actually a subscription. The program will not run unless you renew the subscription every year. This policy is not mentioned anywhere in the online descriptions. I can understand not being able to upgrade without paying the subscription, but to cripple the program with a drop-dead date is unforgivable."
5,Good product,"Good product looks very solid.The only minor things is that the lock shakes a little but, I couldn't find anyway which would fail.Great product and great work out for the abs"
5,"step aside inversion table, meet your new teammate: inversion boots!!!","I have been using a Teeter inversion table for several years. *The Teeter is a very high quality product which has provided me a lot of relief. The inversion boots, however, provide me a greater degree of relief (for that which ails me).I now use the Teeter and the boots. The boots provide a high degree of portability which is awesome. Relief is just a horizontal bar away!"
1,gravity unaffected!,"I bought these, and they do not change the effects of gravity at all.At least they look cool."
3,Bar Hanger,Overall ok. The boots hurt like hell to hand from even with extra padding. I have been hanging for about a week every day and there is zero tension in my back.
4,Was there ever any doubt?,"When I was 18, I toured Dachau and the experience has stuck with me for over 20 years. I remember there being a ominus weight in the air and, believe it or not, you could sense terrible things happened there. As someone who works in the legal field and someone who has been to Dachau, I really enjoyed this book. As far as I'm concerned, there was never any doubt about the guilt of the charged individuals discussed in this book. I was left with a feeling of respect for the defense counsel who must of had the worst post-war job going. Defending members of the SS. Excellent read, don't be afraid to give it go."
5,Wow!!,"I run a group for women's wellness and we cover these chapters together, finding the open conversation and homework worth it's weight in gold. The progress over the past fue months is eye opening, I really see a difference in the ladies I work with. Getting past the behaviors that bind them to the""BODERLINE ZONE"" and breaking the old mith that there is no CURE for BPD. It really helps to do this program in a group setting. The group is able to experance how it feels for others. This has been a wonderful experence personally and profesionally. I say to do this workbook as a group or with a friend."
4,Goodnight Moon,"I fell in love with her voice the first time I heard this song at a Starbucks.I froze with my cappuccino to my lips, and closed my eyes.Her voice so clear..so angelic. The melody so simple, so breath-taking.""who is this?"" i grabbed the nearest barista and made him run to the back and find out the singer for me.Shivaree..Goodnight Moon."
5,A Trip Worth Booking,"In the third installment of J.L. Abramo's Jake Diamond series, following ""Clutching at Straws"" and the award-winning debut ""Catching Water in a Net"", new facets of both the author and his San Francisco private investigator are revealed when Diamond's latest case comes dangerously close to home. Combining elements of private eye noir and crime thriller, The Maltese Falcon and Mission: Impossible, ""Counting to Infinity"" is a thoroughly satisfying read; funny and provocative, touching and intelligent, comfortably familiar and full of surprises. Abramo and Diamond are improving with age."
2,Disappointing to Celtic music fans,"This album's okay, but a bit of a disappointment to those of us who prefer her old Celtic and traditional songs, which are sparse here."
3,"Fun kit, but needs better paint","This is a good creativity kit for around $10, but the paint included is very poor quality. Peels off the butterfly easily and caps are difficult to remove from the tubes. 5 colors are included: Purple, Orange, Pink, Blue, Yellow. Amazon lists different age recommendations, but the box says 9 and up. Probably would be ok for younger kids too, they just might need more help. The butterfly is clear plastic & bulb is also included. Overall, a decent kit for the price. Paint doesn't stick as well as it should, but if kids want to paint & then change the design, the paint will be very easy to remove & start over."
2,WHAT,"This story is a bit interesting but that's about it. This is the fast-food of stories, very little substainces. Why did Spidey have a diary? Did he know of the real universe? Alas, these questions will never be answered now. The only thing done right was that Gwen Stacy was brought back to life for this story. You know after doing a little bit of back reading, I get the feeling that MJ was just 2nd prize in Peter's heart. However, MJ can't take the place of Peter's first really romantic love. I don't get me wrong. I think Peter and MJ work! But, Peter and Gwen would be together through it all ... if that damn,(sob), Green Goblin hadn't !!!Look, I didn't like House of M or really any of them to be exact. House of M is a story that was done just to get your money and nothing more. Sure, they have to tell a pretty convincing/dynmaic story to do that but for me they didn't. The other good thing about House of M. Hawkeye is back, baby!"
1,BPA Warning: Ball / Kerr lids are lined with it!,"What a disappointment it was to learn that all Ball/Kerr metal canning jar lids are lined with the toxin BPA. I hope they're working on a lid that is 100% free of BPA, but in the mean time, if you're searching for lids without BPA, you might try Tattler lids. They are reusable and guaranteed to last a lifetime. There are others on the market as well."
1,A great deal,"If you are looking for a box of broken glass, this is a FANTASTIC deal! If you are looking for a set of 1-QT mason jars, keep looking."
4,Rainbow Country,"Hey, dig the back of your flip flops into the deep beach sand while you dig into your baggy pockets for a lighter and give this selection a listen. What is it? Bob + Lee Scratch Perry, nuff said mon."
1,Don't buy this perfume,"I purchased this item in February of this year (2012), and I stored the bottle for about 6 months. Upon opening it, and spraying it, I noticed that it didn't smell like it usually did. Rather than the pleasant fragrance that I've become accustomed to over the many years that I've used this, it smelled similar to cheap, scented bug-repellent spray. This did not just happen to me. I bought a bottle for my mother, and she complained that when she used it, she could smell the fragrance, but it was much weaker than with other bottles she's used; she claimed the fragrance was almost non-existent.I sent an email to the company regarding this issue, but they never responded.I don't know if this is an isolated incident, but I don't think I'm going to continue using this perfume."
1,"Never received flags, no refund, no customer service","When I ordered these flags, I provided our FedEx, and UPS address, not knowing that the shipper used USPS as it was not indicated anywhere. When the flags didn't arrive, no explanation was given, no effort was made to resolve it. I've e-mailed three times asking for my flags or my money back, and no effort has been made. This is the worst customer service I have ever received while shopping on the web. It gives me pause about using Amazon in the future."
1,An archaeology professor on the goddess,"The plausibility level of this beautifully produced video is revealed by one of its earliest statement: (roughly) ""For thirty thousand years a goddess was worshipped, who was universally known as 'The Great Mother'."" How can it be known what people called anything, thirty thousand years before the invention of writing? I have no argument with spirituality or the benefits people derive from it, but the ""Goddess Movement,"" as typified by this video, relies on guesses and assumptions that are not borne out by any real data that we have about prehistory. This is not, to my mind, a good basis for anyone's spirituality. Richard S. Ellis, Professor of Near Eastern Archeology, Bryn Mawr College."
3,Below average,"A promising start leads to a ludicrous ending, as the author expects the reader to embrace embaressing & improbable communications from the dead. I'm all for a fantastic tale, but this is stupid and sophmoric, an insult. Do yourself a favor and buy something else!"
4,"Challenging, Engrossing, and Thoroughly Entertaining","In the style of author T.M. Wright, Straub has created a wonderfully creepy and classy tale of terror. Fascinating and believable characters are thrust into this world of murder, suicide, and kidnapping. Although the timeline is twisted, throwing the reader constantly from the past to the present, I was never lost. I can see why Straub won the Bram Stoker award for this book. His beautiful prose will not easily be outdone. He has definitely made me into a fan."
2,A snoozer...,"Too many storylines--this book could have easily been 3 separate books. Not only were there too many storylines, they didn't mesh. Wife/mother commits suicide. Nobody cares, and it doesn't matter to the plot anyway. There are lots more examples like that in this book. And the ending is incredibly disappointing. Nothing happens, nothing is wrapped up. It just....ends. A total snoozer. 2 stars because I barely managed kto made it to the end of the book."
2,Lost Boy - did you lose your mind?,"I just finished this book and I am pretty disappointed. The idea behind the book was pretty fascinating, so this book could have been great, but it was just so dull. As I was reading it, I kept asking myself, ok so when is something going to happen. It took forever for anything interesting to build up. I think I was 3/4 through the book before it started to get interesting, and then at the end, I felt really cheated."
3,"decent read, terrible ending...","This is my first Straub book, after enjoying his two partnerships with Stephen King. This book has a slower, plodding pace than I usually enjoy, with relatively few juicy pieces of insite or language constructions that can still make slow, plodding books enjoyable to read. The story itself wasn't bad -- kept me turning the pages. But when I suddenly realized I was still in the ""middle"" of the story, but with only 25 pages to read, I started to get uneasy. Sure enough, the book ends about how my little sister could've written it if she had a weekend deadline and no imagination. It just suddenly gets wrapped up. I kept waiting for the huge ""AHA!"" twist or freaky chase scene or the part where the hero is either almost murdered or revealed to be the murderer himself...alas, it actually ended like a newspaper article. This was lame. Way lame."
4,GREAT BOOK,"I really enjoyed this book although I felt a little short changed when it came to Tunderhills nephew Mark and his friend Jimbo. I would have liked to spend more time with them and know them even better. The haunted house was superb, equipped with evil presence, hidden halls and rooms. Tim is a wonderful character that moves this story along well. The evil character Joseph Kalender was the most scary ghost and the serial killer was perfectly fleshed out. The book moves quickly and you truly hate to have it end."
2,Fatal Voyage,"Too long and drawn out without much substance. Plot meandered without keeping you interested, what a shame as I really enjoy the Bones series."
4,Almost Perfect,"Reichs is a great writer, and her heroine is totally believable, which makes for a great combination of writing and characterization. The only reason I didn't give this one five stars is that the actual murder mystery seemed extremely convoluted and contrived. So, while this may have been her best written book, I also thought it was her worst mystery, hence only four stars. But I still can't wait for the next one."
2,Too...too,"Too long, too many stories, too much detail (down to every French fry and drop of ketchup), too repetitious, and the cannibalism was just a bit too much."
4,Fatal Voyage,"Fatal Voyage is an installment in the series of forensic thrillers featuring Temperance Brennan. This novel sees Temperance sent to North Carolina after a plane crash to assist with the identifying and sorting out remains of the passengers. She soon finds evidence that sees her kicked off the investigation team and banned from the sight. She continues to investigate despite the obstacles and uncovers truths no one was meant to discover, and worries that her life may be in danger.As with the other novels by Kathy Reichs, this one keeps the reader guessing right until the end and is a highly entertaining read! The scientific aspects and explanations are also very interesting....maybe not recommended for an airplane journey though!"
5,The Praetorians,"The book and the dealer are in excellent shape. The translation, however, is not too good. Not only is it ""English English,"" it is stilted. I bought the book to read in English after I read the French original, and it is not a comforting translation."
5,Old Christmas Carols,Wonderful in style and execution; I thought that I had heard the best but I was wrong. Anything from Loreena McKennitt is truly an amazing experience!
1,Bah humbug,"Trust me, ""this album will turn Scrooge into a fan of the season"" was written by someone who likes to sleep a great deal. And they certainly don't know Scrooge. It took 3 ghosts all night to convince me that Christmas is a time for celebrating the birth of Christ, a time for acts of kindness and a time for good will to all. Besides making me drowsy, this CD makes me want to strangle the singer with the wires from her harp. It makes me want to sue for ruining my Christmas spirit. Since that Ghost gang bang, I try not to sleep at all. So I gave this CD to Tiny Tim.So, if your 2 year old is banging his head off of walls while you are trying to sleep, and 2 doses of Nyquil hasn't slowed him down, put this CD on. Don't bother with the repeat button since everyone in earshot will be zzzzzing by the end of the first song."
3,Strange,I just love Loreena McKennitt and have at least 8 of her cds which I would rate a an A+ plus. This particular album wasjust so so. It sticks out like a sore thumb. Maybe she was just in a strange place when she recorded this cd.The cd arrived on time and in excellent condition
3,Not JUST for Christmas,"I would rate this album more highly save that it is rather specialized in its mood. Somehow, I don't think I will listen to it in the bright summer days. It is, as it touts itself, a winter album. But what an album! If you are, as I am, tired of a life's exposure to the same old Christmas music (and I speak of CHRISTMAS music--not ""Santa Claus"" music) which, no matter how lovely, seems too familiar and fails to move one as it ought; then by all means purchase this album. It can be best described in a single word: ""Fresh""."
3,Adventure in Maine,"Homer Winthrop is a boy who has never really had any fun or adventure in his life. He goes on vacation with his mother to Maine, at their cabin. Homer loves the house; it is beside the ocean and has a good view. Homer hears about this person named fake man and wants go on an adventure to learn who he really is.Some things I really liked about the book are that it is full of excitement and you want to read on about Homer's adventure. Some things I did not like about the book is that it does not have much of a climax, there never really is a high point in the book.This book is like Gary Paulsen books. They are outdoors and full of adventure. It is about trying to stay alive but with a different twist in this book."
4,Great price & perfect condition. Not much variety.,"The package actually came a couple days before expected, so I was really excited. The packaging was great and the product was in perfect condition. Great price for the amount of stickers you get. I give it a 4 only because out of 24 packs...I'm only keeping half. The other half was all doubles which I am giving to my cousin who likes Sailor Moon also. There was one pack that I actually got 4 of...I only give it a 4 star because of the fact that I was hoping to get more variety. The other review said they got at least 1 of every possibility so maybe I got my hopes up."
3,Not one of the better handbooks,"This book is definitely not essential. The new spells are nice and would be the only reason to need this book. The kits are not very interesting and don't even compare to the ones in the fighter's, thieves', and bard's handbooks.However, if you love magic users then you will enjoy the handbook. There is a good chapter on roleplaying mages and on spell research as well as spellcasting under adverse conditions. This book is good for customizing a campaign or making new spells, items, or schools as well. But, for those of us that don't feel the need to go so indepth into to the world of spellcraft, this book won't be missed."
1,disappointing,"Nice trains but crappy sound. Where does ""moods"" come in. Sounds is like they recorded it a mile away. Can barely hear it. Just expected something more professional instead of someone chasing trains with a camcorder.I am afraid now to buy any more ""mood"" dvd."
3,Hork's Hairy review,"Awsome, but trivial.Intellectual, but simple.Honest, but vague.Thick, but thin.Tasteful, but tasteless."
3,Can't tell if it works and smells a little too natural.,"Normally when I would use a Glycolic cream on sale at Ross, I could tell it was improving my skin. This one I can't tell any difference and the first few times it seemed like it actually contributed to pore clogging. It's possible I'm beyond hope at this point (hormonal acne makes everything feel like it doesn't work).The other thing is the smell. It's a subtle and non-chemical smell that's mildly annoying. I have aloe and I know it's not the aloe that smells like that."
3,Seems OK now that it is assembled,"Product seems sturdy enough now that it has been assembled. Assembly was easy enough to figure out, which was good, since it came with NO instructions. Also had to scrounge in the garage for a screw that would fit one of the holes which had been drilled smaller than the rest and would not accommodate screws provided. Also one of the caster holes was too large, consequently the caster does not fit snugly."
4,A serious read for AI wonks,"I read this book when it first came out. At the time I had a deep interest in all things AI. The book presents Dr. Hofstadter's experiences (along with those of his graduate students) of implementing creativity modeling systems (and others) at the Fluid Analogies Research Group (FARG). The book is not an easy read. The reader will need to be diligent and not get deterred. The book also is a bit dry in areas, but those who are truly interested in the subject matter will not mind, much."
1,Utterly unenjoyable,"Get yer spoilers here!.......More rawness?? Just because you create a scene of someone getting the chomp put on them by a bunch of mutated missing link cannibals without being cooked first does not necessarilly mean it is worthy of that edgy label. This movie was so bad (how bad was it Bob???) it gets the Holy Cow award for badness. The protagonists (or should I say, hedonists) are completely unsympathetic--and completely boneheaded for taking their eyes off of a suspicious character they pick up from the sea who proceeds to regain consciousness in the middle of the night, go completely coo-coo and run the yacht aground. And if this doesn't make you say Holy Cow, just you watch those last 30 minutes of the film. What the HELL makes a person go in the middle of the night to an elaborate cave system, where they know an entire tribe of cannibals---fanged cannibals---is living and then go explore it?? Maybe it was all those wacky berries she was rubbing all over herself....."
4,Very Enjoyable,What an enjoyable movie. The action and character development was first rate. I only wish the ending was clearer. I prefer movies where it is clear whether or not the actor survives.
4,I enjoyed this movie.,"It may not have been entirely realistic or entirely original, but it was an enjoyable movie. I doubt I would have paid $14.99 for it, but it was fine for a movie that I watched for free for having Amazon Prime. Don't expect this to be some kind of masterpiece, but it's a fun movie so long as you don't expect too much from it."
2,LOST TRIBE LORE,"An archaeological dig reveals evidence of the ""missing link"" in man's evolution which disputes God's creation and ticks off the Vatican. Meanwhile a shipwrecked group of tourists runs into surviving members of this lost tribe.Amateurish acting and uninspired direction sabotages this film resulting in a below-average film. Lance Henriksen's semi-cameo is even uninspiring."
4,"Great, easy-to-use, formula","We have been supplementing breast milk with this formula since our son was about 2 weeks old. We got a sample from our pediatrician and have stuck with it since. He has thrived and now that he's 6 months old I will probably switch over to Enfamil completely soon. One caveat, we started with the ready-to-use kind and then when we tried to switch over to the cheaper powder, our baby did not take to that at all. He would get an upset stomach and become (quite contrary to his usual sunny nature) quite cranky. I have read that other babies experience the same problems when they have gotten used to ready-to-use formula (of any kind) so if you want to save yourself some money, you're probaby better off starting with powder from the get-go. I don't mind though and it's easy for us as well."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"The second book of the Fey is set further into the future of this conflict. The longstanding tradition of changelings in Fey literature is put into play here, as a child is taken, and swapped for a changeling.The upbringing of the boy in his new home will play an important part in the story."
1,Good comedy,"I have seen dozens of Kung-fu flicks growing up and I am very disappointed with this film along with the 3 others it came with in the boxFive Shaolin Masters, etc. The action is just lousy. Acting is great. Comedy is great. But I bought it for the martial arts not for the storyline, nor the acting. I would have rather it be the ""unbelievable"" kind of film were the characters were flying from tree to tree (what I watched as a kid) than this ""soap opera"" quality.Those who like Snake in the Eagle's Shadow or even the newer Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon will be sorely disappointed with the fight scenes in this one."
5,Wenger Internet Optical USB mini mouse,This mouse is very handy for browsing as it has the extra buttons for back and forward options on any browser. It's small and fits well in the laptop case. It's must acceessory for anyone who is on the run.
5,The best of Loreena Mckennit's album,This is her best album.(The Visit too) Every songs are well recorded.Smooth and spirit. I can listen to this album night and day.Get one and you'll be happy.
3,A little easier to understand than some of her other albums,"I like this album better than most of her albums because she is a little easier to understand, plus which one of the songs, Standing Stones, is really cool.Can't really say I reccomend it though! Kate Price has been compared to Ms. McKennitt and she is a LOT better!"
5,"Wonderful, colorful reference","I'm not an expert and only own a couple other books on wild herbs and plants, but I do know that many edible/medicinal books out there only have line drawings for the plants, which doesn't help my untrained eye at all. I NEED to see full color photographs of the plant, its leaves, flowers and fruit and different stages in the season in order to identify it. This book satisfies most of that need. The informative sections on each plant are concise and well-written.Another thing I like about the book is the size and binding. It renders the book just the right size to take it with me in my daypack, backpack or fanny pack. So I can have it where I need it: when hiking the Rockies, which is what it's meant for."
1,Not a happy camper,"I was under the impression that this was a mid level shoe. Higher than a low-cut shoe. The 1st day I used them I rubbed a blister on the back of my foot which I have to avoid doing due to my diabetes. I now can only use these shoes to go out in, not for walking that I was buying them for."
2,Almost expire!!,It is a brand new item but it is only good for 2 month for the expire. I do not recommend this product. very disappointed!!
1,Dishonest shipping prices - BEWARE,"I ordered this product and received it quickly and it was the product as stated, which was all great. Here is the problem, I was charged $ 9.98 for 2 twin packages, which I thought was a little high, but was still okay with it, UNTIL I received the package with postage due of $ 1.02. I went to my post office with the package to find out what was going on. I showed them my receipt where I was charged $ 9.98 for shipping / handling but NOW STILL OWED MONEY. They weighed the package and the cost should have only been a little under $ 4.00, they informed me I was definitely overcharged and didn't even make me pay the postage due because they told me I had already paid too much, and the seller should pay the difference. This was my first time ordering from this company, but will also be my last, buyers beware of extra charges to make the deal look sweeter."
2,Ran low on color ink in one month of light usage,"After one month of light usage and no picture printing, printer message said ink was running low. Printer started to miscolor images and text. Cleaned heads and a aligned cartridges, still no good. Changed to new cartridges and works ok. Got stung on this one."
2,Ink Is Old,"This product came from SophiaGlobal, whoever the hell that is, and is like two years past its ""due date"". The black ink seems to be ok, but have no idea what dated ink means. That is the only reason I am not giving it a ""0 stars"" rating. I don't mind if something is severely discounted because it's old, but tell me that up-front. Sucks."
3,"Outrageously Expensive Ink, that does it's job","Let's face it, THIS is the best ink you can buy for the manufacturers printer, being that the product was explicitly designed for their printer. Of course, it's ridiculously expensive, like most manufacturer's printer ink. One must wonder WHAT exactly it is they put in this ink. Is it from the rare endangered Printorical Squid painstakingly caught in the deepest depths of the Mariana trench?Anyhow, 3 stars - 5 for great ink quality, 1 for price, averaged together for 3."
5,Brand product at a low price,"An HP brand combo pack, at a very low price from this merchant. I will definitely be ordering from them in future."
3,"Quirky, offbeat, supporting characters make it for me","I'm not really a Sandra Bullock fan, but my wife doesn't mind her - I found this DVD used and picked it up.Whilst Sandra's character is hard to empathise with (which creates a major difficulty and directly affects the success of the film) and assuming you can buy the idea of her dressing like someone 15 years younger than her, the supporting guys in the cast add some weirdness and lift up the movie, making it worth watching for me.Thomas Haden Church and Ken Jeong are the reasons I will return to this film - not anytime soon, but we'll be keeping the film in our collection for a while.There is comedy, but there is a fair amount in the story that seems to go unexplained (such as why the male main character is being followed) which makes this a hard film to like.I do recommend it as a rental."
3,"Not bad, but not good","I won't say I expected a lot from All About Steve, but I expected more than what was delivered. All About Steve at times stumbles between being a cross country road comedy and a stalker fest. Are we supposed to sympathize with Mary? or detest her? Sandra Bullock plays the role of a quirky, eccentric crossword puzzle enthusiast with a knack for always wearing her red boots who becomes infatuated with a man she met on a blind date and goes cross country to follow him despite his many protests and rejections. It's a rather interesting plot, and looks like it would make a hysterical comedy on paper, but on screen at times it falls flat. It's a funny comedy netherless, but there's something about this film that isn't quite complete."
2,All About Steve,"All About Steve is the quirky plot line of Mary Magdeline Horowitz (Sandra Bullock), a crossword puzzle creator, and her search for normalcy...or at least for her search of acceptance in a ""normal"" world. Mary's adventure begins when she meets blind-date Steve (Bradly Cooper) a sexy news reporter who unwittingly invites her to his next on-site job. Ensuing is a tale of love, friendship, deceit, and heroism with classic scenes and lines that will warm your heart.I really enjoyed this movie. There were times when it felt a bit slow, but Mary's lines are so off the wall it kept me watching. I love that there were so many lives woven together and that so many characters in the movies learned valuable life lessons. Definitely a great movie to watch with your girlfriends on a night in. All in all; sweet, quirky, funny, surprisingly appropriate ending and endearing."
