2,I'm not feeling this product..,"I'm big with the Philosophy line and cinnamon buns is my favorite body lotion, but the lip shine is nothing special. The scent in wonderful, but it doesn't last a minute! The second you put it on your lips, the scent and taste is gone. Although it's not tacky like most lip glosses, it does go on rather thick. I won't be buying this again..."
1,This is awful,"This collection of poetry is just awful. None of the poems have been published in a journal, and for good reason, they're not very good. It's poorly written with the intention to shock, but without the originality, skill, or edginess you find in cutting-edge poetry. Lennon goes over the top in his attempt to shock, and instead creates poor poetry. You want to read a poet who skillfully plays the edge between risqueness and over-the-top, but still staying on this side of it, then read Kim Addonizio or Sarah Cortez. Avoid this book. I think Story Line, which normally publishes good work, published Lennon to try to give it an edge to its reputation. Let's just hope Story Line goes back to publishing quality work again."
1,History Channel needs to get the real truth!,"This is a well produced show of the same old version of Billy the Kid. I suggest that the History Channel get the real story and put together an interesting and educational documentary on Billy the Kid. Two of the twenty-six known claimants were Brushy Bill Roberts and John Miller. I wrote the book, ""Billy the Kid, His Real Name Was..."", and Brushy Bill was NOT Billy the Kid! When the request came through to dig up Brushy Bill's body, I fought it tooth and nail. I told the Hamilton, TX City Council to reject the idea, but if they dug his body up, to compare his DNA with his real mother in Hopkins County, TX. I am waiting on the History Channel to contact me to set the record straight."
1,Are you kidding me?,"If this is a horror novel, then I may be also a candidate to be the new Stephen King because I have better stories under my belt than this drivel.What starts great with chills of isolation from civilization and convincing youngster jealousies and contests turn into mediocre with werewolves, underground tunnels, City Inferno like scenes right down to terrible with fantasy-like drivels, gods and rituals....There are something like a storyline but you can never be sure and characters are jokes, shifting constantly from pure evil to pure good to pure couregous to full traitor. Horror factor drops below zero and freezes there.Simply skip...I wish someone in Leisure Books had read this drivel before publishing it.Now do I have to still a new Stephen King book to read a good horror story? No of course. But new authors do not show any promise, sorry."
3,Didn't Deliver Like I Thought,"After reading ""The Freakshow"" I was expecting an all out gorefest. I think I was expecting way too much out of this author's debut novel. It wasn't a bad novel. There just wasn't the action and madness there was in ""The Freakshow"". The basic idea was cool with the five people who accidently end up in a house of horrors but it didnt turn out that way. There was just to many things going on with the revolution from ""below"" to Dream's love with the master (I think that totally killed the story). Things were never explained like why was Chad the chosen one to lead the revolution? Why were there werewolves walking around?Overall it was an entertaining read, but it if your looking for more action and violence than check out ""The Freakshow"" or the this books sequel ""Queen of Blood""."
1,Clasp broke after 1 week.,"IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO GIVE THIS NEGATIVE STARS, I WOULD!I bought 2 of these items for each of my kittens at a pet store for $6 each. All I can say is that I thought they were adorable at first. They are total crap. The ""safe"" clasp is NOT safe for cats! It's plastic and a small piece broke off and my 8 week old kitten could have eaten it! I went back to the pet supply store and they replaced the item for one of Li'l Pals other types of cat collars. It's stretchy with a Metal clasp and completely adjustable. I recommend that one!DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR PUT YOUR PETS IN JEOPARDY BY PURCHASING THIS ITEM."
3,Nice collar but...,"The collar is nice, it is fairly soft and light weight and has a nice breakaway buckle if the cat gets caught on something. BUT - the collar of the buckle is awful! The collar itself is a fairly light green color, not far off from the photo. But the buckle parts are shocking neon lime green. It looked so bad on my poor cat that I ended up using a different one."
3,Suede Safe Cat Collar,"My healthy 17 yr old cat lost this collar and his tags within two weeks of first wearing it. I assume that the collar released but the release reason is unknown. I never found the collar. Without tags he is not safe from pickup by the animal control officers. I changed to an elastic collar and a new tag. Within a week the second set of tags and the cat were missing. Simply stated ""keep your cat indoors"". Mine was safe for 17 years as an indoor cat. He desperately wanted outdoors part of the day. He escaped and I lost him regardless of whether he has a collar or a microchip. My other two cats were this brand and type of collar but they stay indoors. The bells assist me in knowing where they are in the house. If they lose thier collars, I can always find it within the house and reattach. I am fine with the collar for indoor cats."
2,Not Rienzi,"The fact that Hitler liked this opera does not make it an opera about Hitler and the nazis or Mussolini and his fascists. This is a director's 'take' on the opera completely changing the motivation and actions of the principals. As such it is a travesty though well sung, played and acted. But never believe this is Wagner's Rienzi - you only have to read the libretto to see how falsely this version represents the drama.There is a wonderful and absolutely complete (not 9 hours) performance of the opera on cd conducted by Sir Edward Downes originally broadcast by the BBC in 1976 - well worth seeking out."
4,RIENZI,"The vocalists are simply great. It was difficult to imagine this opera taking place during the time of Mussolini! But it is the only extant video we have of RIENZI, albeit with many cuts. I think Wagner is turning over in his grave."
4,Not eurotrash,"I too am a Wagnerphile extreme and have been waiting 20 years for a video-DVD-Blu-Ray of Rienzi. I don't mind updated staging if they magnify the themes and plot of the opera under the lens of more recent historical events. The lens of fascist/totalitarian war-time Europe in the 20th century is quite enlightening for the debut DVD/Blu-Ray of Rienzi. Does anyone really want to see an opera set in 14th century Italy, especially an opera that , likely none of us have ever seen?My biggest diappointment in this set is the tragic cut of my favorite choral scene 'Der Tag ist da, der Stunde naht...Auf Roemer auf' This version retains a few quotations of this Act III scene 3 choral music, but the rousing 7 mins of music (Disc 3 track 1 of Staatskapelle Dresden/Heinrich HollreiserWagner: Rienziis tragically cut.Rienzi will unlikely ever make it into the German repetoire but I recommend St√∂lzl's production to any serious German operaphile."
2,JUST ANOTHER MOVIE YOU'LL FIND AT YOUR LOCAL VIDEO STORE,"A COP [DON ''THE DRAGON'' WILSON] LOSES HIS JOB. OUT OF WORK, HE GOES TO A MOB BOSS FOR A JOB. STRICTLY-BY-THE-NUMBERS ACTIONER IS VERY UNEVEN AT TIMES. HAS A FEW GOOD ACTION SEQUENCES, BUT IT ALSO HAS A LOT OF DULL MOMENTS. ONE THING THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION IS THE SHOCKING FACT THAT CYNTHIA ROTHROCK [WHO ONLY HAS A LIMITED AMOUNT OF SCREEN TIME IN THIS MOVIE] ACTUALLY GOT KILLED IN THIS MOVIE. AND IT HAPPENED IN LESS THAN 30 MINUTES! THE MOVIE IS REALLY BOUGHT DOWN BY A WEAK SCRIPT. THE VILLAINS ARE PRETTY COOL, THOUGH."
2,What happened Don?,"This is by far the worst cast of ""actors"" ever assembled in a martial arts video! I like Don Wilson. However, both he and the remaining cast are horrible actors! This movie is so bad that I left in the middle of it. It thought that Richard Norton and Cynthia Rothrock could bring some life to this movie. I was sadly mistaken!I give this a 2 star rating only because of Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton.-absolutely terrible!"
3,Problem with DVD,I ordered two of these. One for a gift. One came with a DVD and the other had no DVD inside. Amazon very kindly and quickly sent me another copy. It again had no DVD.Amazon decided to refund my money(which was fine) as they felt there was a problem with this product rather than try for the third time.I gave the DVD to my grandkids and am hanging on to my VHS version! It is a great movie--great story---hilarious in parts for both young and old. Highly recommend but be sure to open the DVD case upon delivery to make sure the DVD is indeed inside!!!
1,A Purr-fectly Dreadful Cartoon,"I remember enjoying this movie as a child, but, after viewing it some 30 years later as an adult, I wonder why it ever appealed to me. The animation is second rate, at best - cheaply drawn, with static backgrounds. (The one touch of inspiration was to paint the backgrounds in the styles of the great impressionist painters.) The music, though written by two of this century's greatest songwriters, is entirely forgettable. The story is extremely weak and entirely devoid of any charm or wit. The movie appears to have been produced for the price of a song - and not a very good song, at that. The movie's one redeeming quality is the impressive vocal talent behind it. This cartoon is best suited for young children. Anyone over the age of 9 will be bored with it. When there are so many wonderful family films from which to choose, both animated and live-action, why waste your time watching this one?"
2,Pretty bad,"Why was this movie even made? It is not really that great at all. Why have a couple of cats get drunk? Inappropriate for little kids. They'll be laughing their heads off at Robespierre and Jean Tom and then, you know what they'll do? They'll go get themselves drunk! Also, the animation is really bad and cartoony. The only reason I didn't rate it a 1 star video was because the plot was great. Judy Garland shouldn't have used her voice to sing those awful songs, and that goes for Jean Tom too. I just flat out did not like this movie."
4,A thorough review of forces tearing at families,"The authors do a nice job of showing how such diverse forces as lowered wages, poorer access to health care, and expensive housing put parents in an economic crunch, thanks largely to pro-business forces. Equally they show how the dimunition of the role of fathers, the attacks on marriage in a pro-divorce culture, the usurping of parental authority by social agencies, thanks largely to traditionally liberal forces, all contribute to attacks on family. This coupled with an ""entertainment"" culture that emphasizes violence in film, music and video games and further diminishes families. The parents bill of rights is excellent, what is lacking is a place for us to sign up, and a champion to lead us against the anti family forces on the true issues of economics, housing, schools and taxes."
1,One more example of erroneous collectivist thinking,"The thrust of this book is that the government doesn't take care of the family unit in America anymore resulting in all of the societal problems that pressure families. On the contrary, the extremely irresponsible manner in which parents are now raising kids has more to do with societies problems than just about any factor. It is all part of the liberal collectivist sophistry that the average, unthinking American buys into so readily. If you hold reason and intellect as important ideals, this one will either give you a good laugh or bring on a bout of anger."
3,Chamber Base (Jar) for Diatom D-1 Filters,The product was delivered quickly and packed well. Though it was not what I expected. The Jar is made of plastic. The original Jar was made of glass. The description is very vague.
4,Good Workout Tools!,"I really like these products. They are durable (I received them in 2006, and it's now 2011), provide good resistance, and just generally have lived up to my expectations.The only real con is that the material's a little bit slippery so I find it's best to wear shorts, as the foam holds on to one's bare legs a little better. They're not the easiest to store--they can't really be folded out of their primary shape--but the good targeted workout they provide is worth it!"
5,"Love it, Use it and see the change","I have owned a thigh master since they first came out and am now on my third one. So easy to use and keep your thighs and arms toned. I use it at the very least 100 times a day. When I first get up in the morning, when watching TV and, anytime I take a break. It's so easy to use, you can take it with you anywhere, and you get great results in just a couple of months. I would not be without one."
3,Somewhere in the middle,"Well I didn't hate the book, nor did I like it. It made you content. I usually enjoy reading holocaust stories, but this book was a disappointment. For Marion's story wasn't interesting. It could have been better...much better. Marion goes to a concertration camp and lives decently. But with the over crowding her family is soon nearly starved.Marion weighed only 35 pounds once she got out of the camp. Obviously she felt she had to gain a lot of weight. For the book spent nearly two pages on her dipping chips into mayo. Which I find digusting.Well if you want to read this book go ahead. But it isn't a book I'd reccomend. Read something else."
4,Survival during a terrible time,"This is the chronicle of one family's survival during the Holocaust. Marion Blumenthal Lazan tells the story of how she and her mother, father and brother tried to flee Germany during Hitler's regime. They ultimately were taken to the Berger-Belsen concentration camp where they endured deplorable conditions of death, disease and starvation. Their ordeal lasted six and a half years.This story is such an important one to tell. It shows the strength and determination of the Blumenthals and how they clung to each other to survive during a time of horrible acts. And it shows how they made their own happiness and rebuilt their own lives in the United States after the war. Today, Lazan continues to share her experience by speaking at schools around the country."
5,Four Perfect Pebbles,We were lucky enough to hear Marion Blumenthal Lazan speak here in Des Moines. I knew that I wanted to share her story with my grandsons. We have to teach the Holocaust to our young people so that history will not be repeated!
1,The Chosen Speak,This is a great book to read to understand why Hilter is becoming more loved by young Whites then he was just a few years ago. The Chosen show their true mission; this is far better than the Elders Of Zion or even Klassen's books because it is from the horses mouth.
4,Novelization of the hit movie.,The movie itself was produced for the teenage audience. It surpassed itself in special effects and subtle plotlines that grownups could pickup on.The novelization brings out the actual plotline better without having to rely on the special effects to distract you from gaps in the story.
4,Not Free SF Reader,"A fun space adventure, aimed at the younger crowd, but with enough depth (and videogames) to prevent it sinking."
2,BLUF: Not for professional soldiers,"I bought this book on a whim while reading only a few lines about the ambush. That purchase was a mistake on my part. This book is for people that haven't been in the infantry for a hot minute. That being said, I wish I would have had this as an introduction to basic infantry skills before I joined up. After being in for only a year, I already knew almost 100% of the information contained within and skipped large portions.If you're looking for something a bit more advanced on small unit tactics but still more condensed than a FM, trySmall Unit Tactics."
5,Light Infantry Tactics for Dummies..! ;-),"This is a GREAT book and highly informative.You do not have to be current or ex-military to understand this book like all others I have read. The author lays everything out in detail and layman's terms so that it is easy to understand and retain. Not only that, this is not an instructions manual that drones on and bores you to sleep. The author actually injects interesting stories about his time in the military that pertain to the lessons he is teaching you.I can't recommend this book highly enough. I would give it 100 stars if that were possible..!"
2,Difficult to adjust to,"I found the regular lifestyles of the main character and her friends and family to be very offensive (promiscuity, divorce, pro-abortion, materialistic/unhealthy debt) and I have deep sympathy for any child born into this! I wish it were illegal for people like this to have children. Not to mention the character is downright ignorant about the female body and pregnancy. How could she think she's having an ectopic pregnancy after she saw the 8 week ultrasound, clearly showing baby INSIDE the uterus? Also, she's 31 and doesn't know how ovulation works??After adjusting to her twisted world, though, I did identify with some of her regular pregancy symptoms, which I guess means that no matter what your walk of life, the 9 month process of pregnancy is the same for all of us. The detailed stories of her ""coming of age"" are a funny reminder of all I've been through so far in my own pregnancy."
5,Very funny and quick read!,"Loved this book, read it in a day. It was funnier than Diary of a Mad Bride which I read when I was engaged. That one was really cute so I wanted to read this one now that I'm married and babies are on my mind. VERY enjoyable!! I laughed out loud a number of times as she goes through her 9/10 months of pregnancy. She keeps a list of ""What no one tells you about pregnancy"" that cracks me up as she stumbles upon these things the hard way! You'll love it, too!"
5,Absolutely hilarious!,I laughed from beginning to end. Anyone who has had a baby or is close to someone who has will really get a kick out of this. It has become my new baby shower gift for all my friends.
5,I laughed so hard I had contractions.,"Love it -- another great yarn about Amy, the fiancee character from Wolf's first novel, and a sort of funny & sly how-to (and how not-to) of pregnancy and childbirth. Definitely better than the other preggo novels out there. Get this one."
4,Good,"I WISH this book had been out when I was pregnant. It's a whimsical look at pregnancy and the issues that go with it. Honest, likeable story.I'm only giving it 4 stars because I got tired of looking at the same ""Things To Do"" list again & again. The reader can figure out for themselves what got crossed off as she accomplishes her baby preparations."
5,THE WHOLE CD,"THIS CD IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST FOR SLEEPING TO! THE TITLE ""TRANQUILITY"" DOES NOT DO IT NEAR ENOUGH JUSTICE. IT BORDERS ON HYPNOTIC WITH THE RYTHMIC SOUND OF RAIN, THUNDER AND SVERAL TYPES OF SYNTHESIZED SOUNDS. YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!"
5,Good times,"I had this book when I was a girl scout and used it up completely. Now, I have it again and am enjoying it just the same as before."
1,Defective,"It arrived with a broken closure, as I was in urgent need , I had no time to return it. It continues to crack at different places after a short time using it. The igloo I purchased directly from a store has held up!"
5,Among the very best of contemporary romances,"This is, as far as I'm concerned, one of the best contemporary romances ever written. The heroine isn't a flake like most of Krentz's heroines, but is smart and very feisty. The hero, Nick, is what's special, though: Instead of her usual man of mystery or engineer with frozen emotions, Krentz has created a vibrant hero who's loving, humorous, and strong but not pushy; he's a masterpiece, and the tenderness of the relationship between him and the heroine, Philadelphia, is deeply moving. Among my all-time favorites."
5,All time classic,"I love this book so much that I've read it 20 times. I'll never tire of Philadephia and Nick's love story. Unlike other romance novels, they appear to be real with realistic problems. This is one book I've never regretted buying."
1,Preverted,"I LOVE Heinlein and am almost done re-reading all of his works, but this one I actually could not finish. Going through endless blabbings about sexual fantasies and orgies is just not my thing. I found the book preverted and gave up about 1/3 of the way through it, when it came to incest. They say that this is one of the Master's last works. I find it very painful to see such a miserable ending of a life-long of wonders."
2,"Thorough, outdated, too general, turgidly written","This text covers the field of audience research and ratings thoroughly, but it's dated. Sampling and statistics are clearly explained. Although the writing is well-organized, the prose is turgid. Many of the concepts need vivid illustrations. Understandably, the authors avoided contemporary examples of radio and television programs. The text should be brought up to date."
3,How to Make Injection Molds,"I do not recommend this book to a beginner, who've just entered this field as the contents are somewhat unorganized. I think that as a reader, an author focuses his book mainly for experienced mold designers.But overall, if you are an experienced mold designer, who's looking into specific details of tool making, this is a welcome addition to your book collection."
3,I got it for $13,As my title shows I bought this for 13 bucks at Best Buy and couldn't pass it up. It really is a bunch of Horny guys trying to peep and the girls who came to their school for the summer. There were some parts with the guys that were really disturbing for me. The main characters were likable as well as the other girls. It wasn't until the last couple episodes that I actually became interested and the actual plot was revealed. It's OKAY for a starter Anime.
4,It's not THAT bad,"I watched this with a need for something light-hearted and was not disappointed. The subtitles match the English voice track pretty well so there's not much to lose listening to the Japanese.I found it sufficiently different in story and character detail from other anime to be a worthwhile addition to my collection.It has a VERY strong fanservice content, a middling comedy aspect and a nicely handled romantic story line. Sure, there are some ecchi aspects that were not my cup of tea, but on the whole I enjoyed it."
3,"It's fine for mindless ""fan service"" entertainment","This is a 3-disc DVD box set of the Green Green anime. However, the title of the set (Green Green Complete) is a bit misleading, because there is technically one more episode that was never released in the United States. Each disc contains four episodes of the series, as well as some extras ans trailers. The extras came from three character DVDs that were released in Japan back in 2003 and 2004; these extras include mini-episodes, music videos for ""character songs,"" television spots, textless version of the opening, textless version of the closing, as well as three alternate closing sequences.Green Green is ultimately mindless ""fan service"" entertainment, but it was done in such a way that it was enjoyable viewing. While this set may not necessarily be teeming with special features, it's worth picking up if you're a fan of the Green Green anime."
4,Not Bad,"For the genre, its fairly typical. Nothing really stands out that sets this on the level as being ""amazing"", but it is by far not the worst as some people make it out to be. It's fanservice...the male characters are suppose to be perverted! Having seen Eiken, this is no where near it. Yes the male characters are perverted, but there's a resemblance of a plot, and there's humor to be had from it.I'm 1 disc in of the 3, and so far there have been several laugh out loud moments. Bacchi-G', the overweight character of the group and the mastermind behind most of the antics is by far the funniest. In a scene in which he's helping to find one of the lost girls, he's using a ""dowsing rod"", but he refers to it as a ""douching rod"", and it's attached to his pants; for some reason I thought that was hilarious.All in All, given the prices for this via Amazon's Marketplace (new/used), if you can find it cheap, it's well worth the investment, as I'm sure anyone will get a good amount of laughs from it."
4,Looney Tunes gets updated,"We were able to review this DVD and true enough, it has been updated...They still have the original characters, but the stories are in today's settings.The Bugs and Daffy on a game show about best friends, where Bugs totally points out that Daffy is to centered on himself to know anything about anyone else....Although I do think it is cute and a great gift if you want to attempt memories of the Looney Tunes with your younger ones...I believe that they are trying to gear it to the younger generations and be ""cool"" versus being the timeless classic that it once was..."
5,Florida Gators-Back 2 Back National Champions 2006-2007,They followed through on all areas as stated . I will continue to use this company.
3,charming pictures of people,"charming pictures of all kinds of people, kids and men, women of all ages and types. They made even ordinary looking people seem attractive and charming. Book is fairly helpful for basic styles for beginner."
3,"women's mules, a bit uncomfortable","I like the color and fabric very much, but this shoe is a bit tight for my very wide feet. I have other BASS shoes that are great. not giving up, pitch till you win!also -speedy delivery"
1,No Substance,The Power of Purpose treats an important and interesting topic in a trite and superficial manner. The author repeatedly states the importance of finding purpose in life via a litany of loosely related stories but never manages to move forward into any substance on the topic.
3,So-so book,"This book was recommended to me by a personal coach and lots of people rave about it online. It was a very easy/quick read and it was thought-provoking in places. I get the whole part of identifying your passions and strengths -- those you know you have and those others tell you have. Didn't have any trouble with that. But I could have used more examples of other people's 'life purpose"". Or better advice/explanation of how to get from passions/strength to purpose; I thought that was a weak part of the book. Bottom line... at the end of reading it I still didn't know for sure what my life purpose was. But as noted, it was thought-provoking, so not a complete waste."
1,"2010 Second Edition, skip it","I just read the 2010 Second Edition of this book. Shallow, monotheistic, and pop self-help are cruel things to say but sum up my assessment. Hoping for insight, I found none but did find pop Christian platitudes like, page 135, ""Its a spiiritual call - a nudge - from a loving Creator who wants His creatures to fulfill their purpose on earth."" Oh stop, at least give medicine, science, and evolutionary biologists a nod."
1,Bangkok Girl,I cannot believe that with so deep a subject matter we can be presented with such a complete lack of any understanding or comprehension . To add to this the production itself is very poorly exhibited. I've seen holiday home video's of vastly more interest. Jordan Clark should get a job filming televangelists as punishment.Regards Michael Kent.
4,Smart rolling bag,"This is a great bag if you need to be highly organized and cram lots of gear into it. Four stars instead of five because it should have double rolling wheels rather than two singles. Nevertheless, it is the second one we've purchased because we haven't found one to top it for the price."
4,Almost perfect,Really nice earrings that catch the sunlight beautifully. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is becuase the silver is really really shiny.
4,"The Origins of a Pragmatic, Thoughtful Judge","Now that Justice O'Connor has stepped down, historians will be trying to assess her place in 20th- and 21st-century America. This book will provide many clues. The need to craft rough and ready solutions to practical problems on a ranch is not far from O'Connor's pragmatic approach to legal issues. Solve today's problem today and tomorrow's problem tomorrow. This is not to be simplistic -- every human being is complex -- but it is a helpful beginning towards an understanding of O'Connor's jurisprudence, which is ""conservative"" but not ideological.As may be clear from the above paragraph, this book says little or nothing directly about Sandra Day O'Connor's years on the Supreme Court, but it says a good deal by indirection. It's a very engaging read, though a few chapters dealing with individual ranch hands became a bit tedious."
1,Wish they'd been upfront,"I bought this CD because I am trying to find a nature CD with wind sounds and no music or voices. Buried on the back, this CD states nature sounds are artfully interwoven with ""Contemplative Harmonies"" which I assume means music enhanced. I wish they had spelled that out right upfront. I wouldn't have ordered it had I known, and I am returning it unopened."
5,"Best value, gorgeous picture.","Why on Earth would anyone pay hundreds and thousands more for another brand 42"" TV when Westinghouse is cranking out TVs like this one? We bought ours a month ago and couldn't be happier with our purchase. Easy to use, great picture, lots of inputs, easy to hang on the wall. It's easily the best deal in name-brand LCD 42"" TVs on the market. A friend of mind just paid close to $2000 for a same-spec Samsung LCD TV. I can't tell a difference in picture quality, but I can tell you whose TV is paid for!"
3,The book gives you what it says it would.,"I gave this book 3 stars because it filled an information nitch for me.I do agree that a Conway's book would be better. but There are very nice line drawings in this book.Also for WWII German ships the old Doubleday series is better for ships that were projected but never built (or completed).Also for more detailed information of any battleship / battle cruiser, I would recommend 'Battleships and Battle Cruisers"" by Sigfried Baeyer (name may be spelled wrong, but it's close)As I already have many reference books on the German Navy, I bought this book for one reason, this book has the color schemes for the German Navy, from before WWI to the end of WWII. No where else have I found this information.For me the book is worth it."
2,Mary Kay TimeWise Age Fighting Moisturizer,"Mary Kay TimeWise Age-Fighting Moisturizer (Normal/Dry Skin)I have to say I don't like this product. Will not purchase again. Maybe I'm so used to the night cream, that I feel this just leaves your skin ""dry"". I will continue to use a touch of the night cream as a day time moisturizer under makeup. (A very light touch only!)"
3,dog work,"I have not had much chance to read the book yet, but it looks good. I'm interested in doing ""nosework"" with my dog. Something new!"
4,Addicting like nothing else!,"This was the first Corner Shop series game I owned, and I'd say it's equal to the first one. They're both addictive and cute games for anyone who likes tycoon-cutesy-repetitiveness sort of games. But, they aren't extremely redundant and they don't get old that quicky; at least not to me. But they do reach that point of an ""end"".I haven't seen game play replicated this way before (check out a demo or a video on YT to see what I mean). I've still yet to come across games that work the way TC:CS games do. I love their uniqueness.These games also actually have storylines!Consider this purchase."
4,Good WWII submarine movie. Excellent action scenes.,"This movie may be a bit wrenching on your emotions, due to the difficulty of the command decisions by the captain of the sub. Some people think it is ""stupid"", but I think if it were actually them there in his shoes they may have did the same thing. If he did not fire on the carrier using the prison ship screen, his superiors may have considered him unfit for command. This would have made him ashamed of himself in front of his only remaining family: the U.S. Navy. However, I think he could have set the torpedo depth deep enough to shoot under said ship and hit the carrier (I am a hardcore sub-sim gamer). But this was an actual real-life account of what happened in WWII, and as such must be depicted as what really happened.Excellent action. Good acting. Very interesting. Good account of social interaction between crew. Good account of captain's family interaction."
1,Awful,"I lived in the Middle East for 3 1/2 years. This CD was awful and not like any arabic music I have ever listened to. If anyone wants to try it, you can have mine for FREE."
5,A good buy.,"This is an excellent little book. Could have used a few more pictures, but those that there are are inspirational. I have begun, since I received it, to work my way through, and my husband definitely noticed the difference in his dinner a couple of night ago! There are very few recipes that call for items difficult to obtain, and there was a great section on yoghurt-making and the making of little cheeses one can store in olive oil - very simple, and great for Christmas gift ideas. There's an excellent little conversion page @ the back of the book as well. This is the first meze book I've bought, but I'm definitely inspired to buy more. As the dishes are small and easy to make and most of them are served at room temperature they're really good for preparing beforehand and then you don't have to worry about synchronizing the food being ready with people's arrival. I'm looking forward to making many more items from this book. Recommended."
1,okay,"Just be sure to search carefully for application. This item was supposed to work in my car, but didn't because it ended up being the wrong choice because of application information I didn't find until after I'd ordered."
5,Great book!,"Dinosaurs and prehistoric animalsBy: Gram Welfare, Bernard Robertson and Robert AytonThe book was about dinosaurs and fossils from prehistoric times. My favorite dinosaur was the Dimetrodon because its big scale on its back. It is so cool. It's face is also cool too. I liked this book because tells about the dinosaurs that lived millions of years ago. You should read this book because its very educational."
1,Ummm...Not Lovecraft.,"Revision, elaboration, colaboration... call it what you want, it's just a way of cashing in on a great author's name for what amounts to a collection of extremely mediocre fiction, even with Lovecraft's undetermined amount of help. For compulsive collectors only (who I doubt will ever actually take it off the shelf and read it)."
2,It all comes down to Time,"Purchased this Battery in October, 2009, as a back up. It was installed late November, 2009 and Died early March 2010. This time I found a Panasonic battery for my Panasonic phone for half the price. Time will tell if it will last any longer, but it could not be any worse, and if it is the same, it cost me 1/2 the price..... I can not recommend this battery"
5,great product good family entertainment,"My daughter 13 ask for this for Christmas, and we have played it as a family -it is very entertaining for those who enjoy board game, the added twist of interaction with the DVD makes the game relate to the younger family members while those of us who are slightly techno challenged don't have to worry because it is very simple to operate - if the kids will allow you to that is. Of course you should really be a fan of Pirates or at least a Johnny Depp fan in order to get the most from this game"
5,Great series,"The year 1956 was a crucial one in the history of American popular music. It was the year rock'n'roll burst fully on the scene. The year of Elvis. Capitol Records was still making great pop music and this CD gives some wonderful examples of hits, misses and interesting covers, like Margaret Whiting's lovey version of the Bing Crosby/Grace Kelly hit, ""True Love.""Besides the obvious, ""Tennessee Ernie's ""Sixteen Tons"" and Dino's ""Memories Are Made Of This,"" there are the lesser known gems, like Kit Carson's ""Band Of Gold"" and the Five Keys' ""Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind.""Great photos, great notes and great release and chart information."
5,Great Book,This book has so many options on what do do with preschoolers. It is a must for any preschool teacher.
3,Thorough......,"lots of topics and ideas, some more suited to home environment than classroom, but on the whole, great usable suggestions."
3,Where is the best track they're written?????????,"why is Sun Going Down not on this best of disc????????????? it is clearly one of the very best even though what is best is still subjective and open to debate, it would be like taking save you. i don't get it!"
3,A little too cute with the names for the various exercises..,"I like the book. It was as described, in good condition with highlighted portions but not excessively so.The exercises are easy to do but the names for them are a bit too cute for my tastes. There are other books I think are more to the point of the exercises than this one."
4,Useful Book,"I did not care too much for the writing style ""cuteness"" of the exercise ""cocktails"", but it is worth buying for the main breathing exercise. Her explanations are clearly written. Even if you don't lose weight, the breathing is very relaxing, and you can do the exercises while waiting, walking, etc.Only problem I had is with the breathing/singing segment. Opera singers have great breath control, but the older they get, the bigger they get--hence ""It ain't over till the fat lady/dude sings"". Leave that out of the next edition."
5,In a class by itself,"This, in my very humble opinion, was the best movie of 2008. It's one to be revisited over and over. An instant classic."
2,Disappointed,"From the time I first heard of this movie I was sure I would like it and waited eagerly for it to be available. Let me say that I am quite a fan of European films and like Bergman especially. When I finally watched it a couple of days ago, I was very disappointed. While I thought the cinematography was quite good, the overall film left me bored and unmoved. I find myself somewhat puzzled by the raves that appear about it here and other places because I feel that it is being extremely over-hyped. Perhaps if I had watched it before reading all the raves I would have like it (at least a little) more.For those who read this and plan to watch it, I would advise you to be sure to set up your DVD player to run the audio in the original Swedish with English subtitles. I accidentally watched the dubbed version and, I must say it was one of the most horrible examples of dubbing that I have ever witnessed."
4,THE RIGHT ONE CAME IN.........,"......THIS MOVIE. ""let The Right One In"" is a odd and sometimes slow-moving film about the relationship between two 12 year old misfits. The boy, cherubic-looking Oskar is bullied by his classmates. The girl, raven-haired and very pale Eli has been 12 for a very long time. Eli is a vampire and a cunning blood-thirsty one.The title of the movie is a reference to vampiric lore that a vampire can not enter a home unless invited in. The consequence of a non-invitation is revealed in a graphic scene.The movie follows this strange and potentially deadly friendship but Oskar and Eli are always there to help each other from life-threatening situations.And the ending is ambiguous and details the future of Oskar and Eli. But does it?""Let The Right One In"" follows vampiric lore pretty closely except there are no crucifixes, no garlic, no coffins, but this movie doesn't need them."
4,Lived up to the hype!,When I heard all the fuss about an American remake being done on this film I had to see it. Everyone said this was a cult classic and it did not dissappoint. Preferred watching it with the english subtitles as the english dubbing was horrible. I recommend you read the book and also go see 'Let Me In' the American version!
4,"a creepy, slow-burn vampire movie","A very unusual vampire movie, from Sweden. I don't like vampire movies but was told I ought to watch this one at least. I'm not sorry.My big beef was that while the movie was just fine, the audio/subtitle situation is awful. The original film is in Swedish. The disk says there are subtitles, but they don't actually appear, even when the characters are reading Swedish. What's left is the awful dubbing, which is just comically bad and a constant distraction and spell-ruiner. Heck, even if you can understand Swedish, you can't get the Swedish audio, which was deleted entirely on the U.S. release.DVD needs to be seriously redone."
1,Horrible translation - Don't purchase,"Saw this movie in the theater, thought it was the most wonderful movie I'd seen all year. Couldn't wait to purchase it. Saw it went on sale, purchased it, received it, popped it in the DVD player, and noticed that the subtitles were drastically different. This link provides a good comparison between the original wonderful translation and the piece of garbage that it was replaced with:http://iconsoffright.com/news/2009/03/let_the_wrong_subtitles_in_to.html"
2,Subtitles Need To Be Fixed NOW,First of all - let me say that this was my favorite film from 2008 and I saw well over 100 films from last year. It's an amazing movie that should be seen by everyone. It's also a shame that the correct version of this film is still unavailable.It's truly inexcusable that nobody at Magnolia knows anything about when the proper version of Let the Right One In will be released. I don't understand why fans of the film are being put through such grueling torment just so they can pay money to see the correct translation.The only reason to buy the current version is because of the quality of the film itself. Just beware that you will have to purchase it twice as there is no exchange policy and you will end up owning two versions.
1,Are the people who reviewed this movie all named Hellen Keller?,"This was the worst vampire movie I have ever seen and perhaps one of worst movies I have seen period. The movie was slow, there was no action. The story didn't go anywhere. I can't understand what people were watching. Save your money and do not buy this one. You will thank me later"
2,Best.Vampire. Movie. Ever?,"Not. Really. Slow and uninteresting more aptly describes this one folks. While I take nothing away from the effort, it reminded me of another movie that came out a few years ago that was overhyped and quite disappointing - The Blair Witch Project. Which is to say, after it ended, I found myself still waiting for something to happen. Very. Disappointing."
2,Listen to it *gulp* dubbed,"Excellent movie, and I hate to say it, but if you want to hear the original theatrical translation, you will need to listen to it dubbed."
5,One of the best films I've seen in years,"I caught Let the Right One In at an international film series showing in my town some time ago and was immediately sucked in. Enjoyed the film, had some great conversation about it afterward and rushed home to buy the book.I really enjoyed the fact that they didn't go over the top with effects, it was very refreshing, (take a hint Hollywood) The story was magnificent and I thought they did a great job converting the script for the film, the Hakan sub-plot was both scary and revolting and I think it would have changed the tenor of the film dramatically, I like them both for what they are.Great movie, I highly recommend it."
4,A heart-warming vampire flick?,"As ridiculous as it sounds, yes, the title of this review pretty much sums up the movie. There are no real scares in this film, just a good story, subtly and intriguingly played out by the two young leads. I highly recommend this film. I did not use the supposedly butchered sub-titles, which have been mentioned in many other reviews here, but be warned that the English language overdubbing is also very bad. The voice actors themselves are fine, but the tone of the voices is all wrong and does tend to take the viewer out of the movie. The voices sound like people talking in an echoey sound studio, not the environments that you see on the screen. At several points I got confused and thought the characters were supposed to be listening to a voice on a radio, until I realized what I was hearing was supposed to be the characters themselves!"
1,No Threatrical after 4. 4/9/10,I've order 4 different times and still no threatrical subtitles. Its drving me crazy.Think i might just give up.
3,Everybody is right,"Movie: 5 starts. English dubbed: 0 starts. Seen both versions, first at the theater with sub-tittles then at home without realizing I rented the dubbed version. Do not go for this version is not worth a penny."
1,Waste of time,This was probably one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. To be classified as a horror is a joke.Take my advice and don't waste your time and money on this film. I guarantee you will be as disappointed as I was.
2,Not The Right One for Me,"I have to go against the majority here as I found this to be boring, slow and also not thought out.I could not waste my time watching all of it so my viewing was limited.I need something to get my attention in the first half hour or I will not watch the rest anymore.I have wasted too much time thinking that they will get better.If this does well maybe I will watch again if I cannot find something else to do.If this little girl vampire has been around for so very long I would think she would be smarter about what she does,also her servant.I would find someone with a little more brains.If this was real she would not of lasted very long,which to me makes this a dumb movie.I just cannot handle anymore movies where the makers think that none of us can use our heads.Now if it does get better (which I doubt)then I apologise for this and I hope you are not offended.Just my opinion.Which I should not have to but some people on here are thin skinned."
4,"Intelligent, nuanced tale of childhood friends and vampires","The Bottom Line:A movie where the undead are back to their former role of ghastly bloodsucking creatures (who don't sparkle, but that's another matter), Let the Right One In is passable as a vampire film but really impresses in its nuanced depiction of a friendship between two young outcasts who find solace in each other; be warned that it's often a very graphic film, but it's also often a very good one.3/4"
2,Boring,"The cover of the dvd says ""Best. Vampire. Movie. Ever."" Wow. I was expecting awesomeness times ten to the nth power. What I got was a barely comprehensible movie that had no surprises, no horror, no sense. I was literally almost bored to death, if that counts as horror.. ;)The version I saw was dubbed in english-oh how I hate dubbed movies-all the real acting comes across in how things are said, and when you dub, you kill the movie. The relationships in the movie were not explained well, either. Oskar is with his dad, then some other guy shows up and Oskar gets upset, but you dont know why, because nothing is said. And the caretaker of Eli, you dont understand what his deal is, why he kills for her, what their real relationship is. Brams Dracula with Gary Oldman is still the best vampire movie ever to me; this is just the weirdest swedish movie ever."
2,Disappointed,"In my opinion, there is no contest between ""Let The Right One In"" and ""Let Me In"". Hammer Films ""Let Me In"" is the better film. It maintains interest throughout. The English script changes are all for the better and the CGI use leaves no doubt that Abby is dangerous. I had absolutely no emotional hook to the children in this Swedish version. After all the hype, I expected much more that the film delivered. The little girl, Eli, looks like an Italian World War II urchin. The type that ran behind American tanks asking, ""Hey Joe, you got chocolate?"" Definitely not vampire material. I never once felt that Oskar had the deep feelings for Eli that Owen displayed for Abby. I will say that the scene with Virginia and the cats was a shocking mouth-opener. Also,the main bully in this version is nowhere near as menacing as the one in ""Let Me In"". The Matt Reeves film, ""Let Me In"" is the one to own."
3,Read Novel Before Watching Film!,"The novel that this film was based upon is a remarkable work in this genre. The film pales in comparison and varies so much from the novel that a great deal of the depth of the tale is lost. Yet if you watch the film first, you'll get spoilers that won't remain surprising and will thus ruin the novel's suspense.If you like vampire literature, then it's worth reading this one, which is considered one of the modern vampire book masterpieces. Then you can watch the film if you want.Having said that, this isn't a bad film per se, but it's a really bad rendition of the book, lacking pretty much all of the depth, shock value, subtlety and horror. Such substantial changes were made between the book and the film that I'm not sure someone who has read the book will be all that fond of the film. But it's still okay."
1,Wait for the right one,There is no excuse for this pitiful translation - regardless of whether you speak Swedish or not - the dvd subtitle track is awful. Wait for the new edition.
1,Great movie ruined by change of subtitles.,"This is another warning about the subtitles. I saw Let the Right One In while it was in theaters, and it is a great film. But these terrible subtitles completely ruin it. Do not buy it until Magnolia gets its act together and releases the original film."
3,It works okay.,This connector worked okay. If you can find a cabale that connects from the Mini-dvi to the monitor I would recommend that over this adaptor. The problem is that the VGA adaptor is heavy and bulky when connected and if you move your laptop ever so slightly the mini-dvi comes out of the computer. It is good for occasional use but I wish I would have bought a superior connector.
3,"satisfactory, I guess","I may just be computer-illiterate (very likely), but I find that once I plug the adapter in my laptop goes nuts. However, with patience and persistence, I can pretty easily get the connection working great. And I love to watch all my online content on the big screen.Also, it stops working well after a while. I go through about 1 a year, which to me, is ok."
5,MIni-DVI to VGA,"This product is perfect, i bought it 1 month ago and it's been perfect, no regrets. smooth transaction."
3,Revolutionary Mothers,"I had wanted to be inspired by heroic true stories. The beginning, at least, was cold reality of what happens to so many women in this life, so, it wasn't very inspiring. Yet, it has stayed with me and helped me to be grateful for my own lot in life."
4,Well-rounded and wonderful history of the female strength.,"This book caught my eye as I was browsing through the History section of B & N. I picked it up and read the first 20 pages and bought it. It is a collection of factual accounts written and witnessed by women and men from the dawn of our country. It will be a book I take out over the years again and again. Probably a book I teach from, too. England and others countries have so much more respect for women at this timeframe. The way the Colonials treated women was detrimental to generations after them and undeserving. Even the Native Americans thought the men pushing out the women for meetings and voting purposes were denying themselves the entire point of views those women would have provided. The book does get a bit dry and boring in some places where the author feels the need to reiterate material for the sake of factual proof. This would, however, make a great PBS short using various stories."
2,"Decent Review, But Several Errors","The book does provide a good review of the accomping material in Raymond Chang's Chemistry: Seventh Edition textbook. However, it is obvious that less effort went into the student study guide, because there are numerous errors. I've only worked through chaper four, and I have already noticed that the book contained at least two wrong answers to problems. I also noticed that a questioned worded ""classify the followning compounds,"" failed to list the compounds to be definded and just had a blank space underneath it. Overall, I wouldn't recomend buying this book; a Chemistry Cliffnotes or QuickReview book would probably be more helpful. If you do buy the Student Study Guide use caution."
1,Our loosely enforced copyright laws,"Although not a badly written book by any means, author Michele Jaffe has clearly spent too many Thursday evenings watching the hit TV series, CSI. This book comes off as clear cut, out-and-out rip- off of the show. It's set in Las Vegas, about the Police Crime Lab (forensics) and features as the protagonist a single mom with a cute six year old daughter...hmmm, sound familar, anybody?Even if Ms. Jaffe honestly came up with this idea BEFORE the TV series was created, some changes should have been made to the book at the editorial state to avoid the obvious comparisons and the overwhelming sense that it's just a ""rip off"".Ms. Jaffe is a better writer than this and should be embarrassed! ""Bad Girl"" reads like a piece of fan fiction with just the names changed. When the No. 1 TV series in the US is about the Las Vegas Forensics lab, you really have to excercise more judgement than this if you choose to write about the same topic.In short: embarrassing."
3,If Your Looking For A Romantic Suspense..,This novel may not be for you. Although there is romance present it is waaaay back on the back burner. This is more of a mainstream suspense book packed with a lot of twists and turns that leave you wondering who the bad guy really is. Although the answer to that question is answered before the end of the book it is still interesting to see how Windy and her team work to get the same answer.If your squimish you may want to avoid this story. The author goes into great detail regarding the murder scenes but I feel this only addes to drawing the reader into the story. There are lags in the story but they are few and far between. Still this was a strong novel and should not be missed.
3,okay,I was frankly quite shocked as to how long this took to get to me...I just received it at the end of last week.
5,"The Assyrian is love, honour, pasion, and friendship","The Assyrian is a very good book. I liked it very much so I thought that maybe there is a second part. Does anybody know if ""The blood star"" is de second? If you know it, please write to me. I'll be very pleased and happy. Thanks from Spain!"
4,Suprisingly Good,"If a Replacments via Wilco and Neil Young vibe appeals to you than I highly suggest you pick up this cd. There is not one weak track on it. Plenty of crunchy guitar, literate lyrics make this one a real winner. Probably one of the best released in 2000. Gingersol has been a favorite for years in the LA area but until this cd had only released one ep. I would say that they have used their constructively to produce a close to flawless disc!"
5,Love my light!,I wanted to update my bathroom light. My cabinet is in the way to have the globes facing down so we have to face them up and it looks good. They give off plenty of light since it reflects off the ceiling. I am very happy.
1,old rusted merchandise,"I ordered this in September for a bathroom remodel. I just now got to the point to put up this light fixture. Unfortunately, the middle light section's chrome is actually pitted and rusty, right out of the plastic bag. (It had been stored since purchase in the box it shipped in, unopened, in my upstairs bedroom, so it was not exposed to the elements or anything like that.) The return window has long since passed, so I'm stuck now with this fixture...I need to learn the lesson to SHOP LOCALLY for items that are costly and could possibly be defective, or old merchandise being passed off as new, etc. I won't shop online again for products like this!"
2,Very good seller but it did not work for my TV,I tried it to connect my macbook to TV but display was not clear.I returned the item and Seller refunded the money. Thanks
5,Worth the money--don't buy Dynex!,It was extremely easy to set up and now I can watch streaming video on my tv just as if I was actually watching television or a dvd! Beautiful picture!! Don't even hesitate about purchasing this product... it is soooo worth the money! (And don't even THINK about buying the cheaper Best Buy brand Dynex... it's soooo not worth the money!)
1,Very Poor product and service,Product was not as advertised. Customer service was slow in replying to my return request. 3 weeks later I STILL have not received a refund even after they sent me an RMA# and approved my return. I would stay away from this vendor.
2,Not so adaptive...,"This adapter doesn't quite work so well-- it changes the display on the computer when you plug it in, and only has a slot for video (not audio) on the TV side..."
3,The transition isn't great,"These glasses are probably the most expensive ones I have ever bought, but I ride a lot around dusk, and wanted transition lenses. When they arrived I was stoked! They look great, they feel great, and they were fairly light indoors. Perfect, I thought. Then I took them outside, and waited for them to get dark..and waited..and waited..and waited. They just DON'T get dark! Ever. There is some tint to them after a few minutes, but I would not call them dark glasses or sunglasses by any stretch of the imagination.I did not return these glasses as I do like the feel and the way they look, but I use them ONLY at night when I ride. I have to put on something darker during the day."
3,for images that will stick in your mind,"Jeff Lindsay has a sick sense of humor - that feature will either attract or repel, depending on the reader's tastes. I found myself chuckling while at the same time making an ""ew"" face...one of the killers in this installment (there is always more than one killer in every Dexter story) is one of the most disturbing literary creations I've encountered. Potential readers have to be okay with (or even eager for?) the kind of plot events that one feels the need to recover from.It shouldn't work that the Dexter stories are told in the first person, but it does. Also, Lindsay gets props for perfect dialogue and for bending characterization cliches into new shapes.By reversing the serial killer novel format, Lindsay might be attracting new readers to the genre."
4,Black Humor for sure!!,"I have read both installments of this Dexter series, and they are certainly unusual. I found myself chuckling often during this story, and then I would feel horrified at myself for laughing at such gory stuff. That's just the way the whole book went. It is really so outlandish, that it's hard to take seriously. But then, why was I so eager to see how the plot played out? I'm anxious to see what is in store for Dexter next."
4,Deborah dominates Dexter,"The book was good. I feel as if Dexter was very subdued in this novel. But the always demanding Deborah was there to order Dexter around like her own personal whipping boy. I found myself feeling bad for Dexter, rarely getting to do what he does best or even getting a moment alone. Deborah barks, snaps,& begs till she gets what she wants using Dexter for her own personal gain. Give the boy a break! Dexter was humorous and witty as usual so I did enjoy his dialog and puns. I'm very anxious to read the next book wondering when Dexter will deal with Deborah!"
4,Its pretty cool,They are a little bit to symbolic but the music is amazing and the lyrics are good once you figure out what they mean to you.
5,best christian hardcore,I have this cd it is by far the best christian hardcore around. Every song is a hit you cant go wrong a must buy.
2,they sound EXACTLY like embodyment,"this cd is horrible there first one is tons better, it seems that they use the same riffs as the last album, so the songs sound the same except for the annoying skreaming!!!"
1,money,"to tell you the truth, this cd is horable. you can't understand what they are saying. personally, i go for the rap. now there's something to pump loud. take my advice and hit the rap section. peace out"
4,"ZAO has talent, needs to turn it up.","First off I would like to state that ZAO has one of the most original sounds I have heard. Their lead singer has a hardcore screaming style that bands in this genre will be trying to immitate for years to come. The reason(atually there are 2 reasons) I didn't give this album 5 stars is the fact that the guitars aren't turned up enough, and the last track ""Violet"" is immensely dry and stupid. Whoever played the piano on this track played the exact same little simplistic tune for over 7 minutes straight. I listened to about 3 minutes of the song and pressed the fast forward on my CD player,not thinking they would actually torture their listeners with this monotonous attempt at a ""poetic"" song. I was wrong. All in all it is a worthy attempt. I hope their new album is recorded with more power, maybe they should hook the amp up to their lead singers vocal chords."
3,Just Ok,"These legos were just ok, a little expensive for what they were, and they were really dusty, and the tape on them had begun to yellow, so I think they have been sitting around for quite a few years."
4,"Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom; or, the escape of William and Ellen Craft from slavery",overall in good shape- more importantly got here on time for my class!
5,Excellent,"I have loved Sting's music since I was 12, I have always enjoyed reading about him, and for once I felt like I learned about him from him.A great read for true fans"
2,O.K. book for a non-fan,"My wife really like this book so I read it after her. I am 38 and grew up with the Police, but they weren't my favorite band. And I never got into his solo stuff. I say that because it probably affected my view of the book.Sting can write. He has a great vocabulary and his writing is lyrical. The problem is that Sting is full of himself with an ego the size of Britain. And the stuff that I wanted him to get into, like his affair, or his time with the Police, were not in the book. I guess the book was o.k., but I can't recommend it."
1,Bad loop,"This movie appears to be a loop which, although not completely ""wrong"", it rather takes away from the desired effect of watching a real fireplace - the logs change color and burn, timbers change. But not in this video. It's not bad for a mood setting item, though it doesn't meet my personal preferences for realism."
4,Hot stuff,"Got this for my wife. She likes a fireplace without the wood, smoke, cleaning. I wish it had a loop process to it instead of a finite time/"
4,Like it!,"The item does exactly what we needed.. It was really difficult to find a handset and phone system that has 4 lines, answering machine & caller id.. My only issue is that people have a hard time hearing me sometimes or I can hear a co-worker dial from the base. Otherwise, pretty happy!"
1,This sucks,"This thing is so hard to put together, it is a waste of time. I wrote rc submarine and that came up. If you by the remote verson it cost up to 650 dollars. Don't buy it."
4,And I don't even like Korn. I STILL don't...,"Yup. I loved the cover of ""Word Up"", but I thought this album was monotonous and boring. In all likelihood, I won't ever listen to this again.I give it four stars because I believe that it does the job of a good greatest hits album; if you listen to this, you can tell whether you will (or will not) like the artist in question.I tried it, and still didn't like it. At all. I am not, nor apparently will ever be, a Korn fan.But it's a fine greatest hits album that presents the requisite tunes, adds a few cuts for the fans, and a nifty little extra DVD for value.That's a four-star CD, whether or not you're a fan."
4,for those who can only digest so much korn,"i never really got into korn but i always enjoyed the singles they would put out so i figured why not.plus ""word up"" is a very enjoyable rendition of the cameo hit and jon sings it very well,sounds very similar.anyways,youve heard all the songs before.some are ok but some are really good (""falling away from me"",""blind"",""got the life"").they left out ""thoughtless"" which is a song i really like and it was released as a single.anyways,if you always found korn to be a decent band but didnt like them enough to buy all their records,this is a good starting point for you."
4,Perfect For The Casual Korn Fan,"I've never really been a huge fan of Korn, but I have liked most of their singles which in my opinion is the majority of all of their best songs. This cd is a compilation of just that, their hits (hence the name). The cd is great I love the covers of Word Up! and Another Brick in the Wall. There is also a pretty good remix of Freak on a Leash. You definalty get your moneys worth with this album considering there are 19 songs and 97% of them are really good. This cd also comes with a DVD of 7 of their songs recorded live (Right Now, Here To Stay, Did My Time, Got The Life, Freak On A Leash, Falling Away From Me, and Blind. The DVD isn't too impressive unless you are a fan of their live performances. Anyway I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of Korn's singles or just a casual fan."
3,It's just not as fresh anymore...,"Korn was one of the biggest Metal bands through the 90s. They dominated all other Metal bands with their music. Although it was similar to normal Metal, it featured a certain sound to it that captivated their fans.This album just doesn't hold up though. The songs get old really fast. Any Korn fan has already heard all these songs before and it's just not something you want to listen to over and over again. The addition of two new tracks, ""Brick in the Wall"" and ""Word Up"", are just average remakes of older songs. I will say that one thing that I enjoyed was the fact that the CD included a DVD with their free show from CBGBs was really fun to watch. Overall though I can't say that this was worth the purchase."
1,dork metal,metal for mall shoppers a collection of numetal poser songs with rap beats and 2 bar chords on guitar buy this and some randy rhodes posters you official nerd u then whine like korns singer about dad being so hard on u that he actually took your mercedes now u are so poor that u have to make videos about dad at the gap
2,hmmm..not really...,"Any real KoRn Fan will tell you that this album isn't even close to being a collection of their best....This has a few of the best....but is mostly crap, if you want KoRn's true best, pick up the self titled & ""Life is peachy"" for sure...""Follow the Leader"" has a few good ones too. Don't be fooled by this poorly constructed ""best Of""...it sadly misrepresents Korn"
1,This sucks,"Honestly, what is this, ohh I know...trash! Blind is the only desent song on the whole album, I bought the album because I liked Blind and Thoughtless, I am soo young and stupid."
1,is this a joke?,"korn's greatest hits? is this even real music? i know that korn lead the nu metal trend and all, but i think that trend is over now. this is like rick james coming out with a greatest hits cd. the moment has passed and nobody wants to relive it through a sh*tty greatest hits cd. if you own this or are thinking about buying it, there are two things you can do: 1. be really f-ing ashamed of yourself, or 2. don't tell anyone. this cd is just proof that korn knows that they suck. they can't write anything new and if they did they know no one would like it so they feel like they should just re-release their ""hits,"" whatever those might be. nu metal was the worst invention ever. i'm so glad its over. thats right! OVER!"
1,GOT AN EDITED VERSION IT BLOWS F**** A****!!! PISSED,I love this cd and needed a new one but got some STUPID EDITED copy. What a crock of S**T!!!! I AM SOOOOOOOOO PISSSSSSEEEDD! I love it for the vulgar language and there is none in it- there is no point in having a cd fron korn if it is EDITED!! I wrote them and they better make it right I will even take a used copy JUST NOT EDITED!!!!!
5,Lovely book for the Spanish learning student!,"I bought this book to assist in my learning of Spanish. It covers everything you can think of about ""Mariposas"" in Spanish. I plan on purchasing more of the series because I like to learn things while I'm learning Spanish. Maybe I'm too efficient happy, but that's what I do. :)"
5,Easy Reading Intro. to Yoga's Theory,"This book is recommended to everyone in our beginner's yoga course. This book gives an easy to understand introduction to the major branches of yoga. Yoga is much more than stretching and this book will show you how yoga can improve all facets of your life. Yoga includes numerous schools, Hatha Yoga for body and mind, Karma Yoga for proper attitude of work (great for stress management), Bhakti Yoga for emotions and devotion, Jnana Yoga that discusses knowledge and Raja Yoga which teaches meditation. A beginner will be able to access this book easily."
2,Not original recordings!,"Be warned! With the exception of three tracks (Show and Tell, Precious and Few, and Easy Come, Easy Go) these are ""new stereo recordings by the original artists."" I assume it's an end run around licensing issues, but speaking as a collector, this 3-CD set is of no use to me."
5,Great book in the spirit of B5,Jeanne Cavelos knows how to write in the spirit of the original Babylon5 and Crusade series. You can just picture the characters in your head while you read her words. Great book!
2,"broken overhead projector, described as:""like new""","WHEN I NOTIFIED MR. SHIRAZ BADRDIN, OWNER OF ""ONIEL'S"", THAT THE OVERHEAD PROJECTOR WAS SHIPPED BROKEN, SINCE I DID NOT FIND ANY BROKEN PART IN THE VERY TIGHTLY PACKED BOX, HE HAD A QUICK READY MADE ANSWER FOR ME:""CALL THE SHIPPER, THEY ARE INSURED"". I TOLD HIM THAT IF I WILL CALL THEM I WILL THEM, THAT I THINK THAT IT WAS SHIPPED BROKEN,AND THEY SHOULD TNVESTIGATE THE PAST CLAIMS OF ""ONIELS AND MR. SHIRAZ BADARDIN, I WAS TOLD TO SHIP THE PROJECTOR BACK, AND WAS PROMISED,TO BE FULLY CREDITED,ICLUSIVE MY SHIPMENT COST.THE RECIEPT OF $25.WAS INCLUDED IN THE PACAGE. TO-DATE I DID NOT RECIEVE CREDIT FOR ANY.IF THIS IS A METHOD OF GETTING RID OF DAMAGED GOODS,AND/OR GETTING SHIPPERS INSURANCE MONEY, IT SHOULD BE STOPPED!"
5,A Must Read!,"Simple, brilliant - you couldn't find a better book to keep handy for those 5-10 minute gaps in your schedule. Brief little snippets that make you smile, nod your head and wonder why you weren't conscious of that bit of knowledge before. I'm passing this one along to all the entrepreneurs in my life."
4,fantastic,"I originally saw this movie on television, and the impression I got from the movie has lasted with me for six years. If you are into anything japanese, I would check this out. The dancing scene alone, with the changing kimono is worth the buy. It didn't get great reviews back in the day, but I found it to be just beautiful. It has amazing sets, costumes and music. I think it to be far superior to any other movies of the day like Shirley Macleans' ""Geisha"" film. The only downside is that the plot may be weak in one or two areas and ends abrubtly. If you are a serious critic of movies, this one may not be for you. As for the rest, enjoy!"
4,DVD???,When will we see a DVD??? (in widescreen please) Loved the movie but watching it on fullscreen VHS does ruin things a bit. Hope Warner Brothers will see what a gem theyve got in this movie and release a DVD soon.
1,monkeys w/ Moogs!!!,"....retro-porno synth noise is nothing to rave about. How can it go outta style if it never was *in*? ""Delicate balance"" my arse. It's damned near bordering on monkeys w/ vintage Moogs. I have to agree that having a real drummer is a point in their favor though. Barring that, the music would devolve into a chaotic blat and tweet of a handheld version of Pong and Missile Command."
2,Not quite revolutionary I was disappointed,"""The Three Step Approach to Golf for women"" is far from revolutionary.. it's basically how to shoot bogey golf. To be very honest I was insulted by the title it should be ""The Three Step Approach to Golf for High Handicappers"". The book seems to naturally assume that as a woman you will not get better unless you improve your short game and course stratgey. If you believe this then perhaps this is your book. However I think you would be better served to pickup a copy of a Dave Pelz book for your short game and there are plently of other golf strategy books around. This book is only 100 pages long and I think you will find you can get a bigger bang for your buck elsewhere."
4,apple Box,"The service I received from Amazon(J&R; Music) was exceptional. The product was shipped very quikly and arrived well before the expected date. Unfortunately I had to return the Box but even that was easy ,organized and hassle free. You have definitely exceeded my expectations and I will continue using your service.Thank You,Ralph Greer"
5,Lord Crawley Plays Olympic Executive,"Twenty Twelve is a hilarious sendup to London '12 Summer Olympics. It gives you, the viewer, another view of how Lord Crawley from Downton Abbey has a great acting range. It also improves the BBC's reputation for funny(yes, funny!) comedy and drama and has the added plus of being narrated by Doctor Who's David Tennant (before Matt Smith joined the Tardis). If you struggle to find funny drama and can't find good mockumentary drama comedy elsewhere give this series a try!"
1,Fail,"The item was unusable. It was dented, and perhaps that allowed air to enter the product, and it was dried and unusable."
1,"Really a pile of crap, from a Nitzer Ebb fan.","I bought this in 1990, and actually borrowed $5.00 from my sister to get it at this record store on Melrose that was right next to the Golden Apple.I hated it. The 'boom-ksss-boom-ksss-boom-ksss-boom-ksss' junk that they glued in behind the songs really got on my nerves quick.Geffen has had a long tradition with screwing up Nitzer Ebb remixes. This is a good example.Stay away from this disc unless you're just looking to buy it for a collection."
5,Underfoot,"Leanne Banks never disapoints her readers. Underfoot was fun, sentimental and kept you rooting for the guy to get the girl. Add in a little murder mystery that keeps you wanting to stay up all night just to see what happens next. I loved it and look forward to reading more books by Leanne."
4,Great office phones,"Great set of phones for our office. Instructions are straight forward and concise. Speaker phone works loud enough for a business office.Tried 3 way calls, works well.\Tried transfer of calls, great.BUT, when a cordless unit is paged from base and the user figures he is wanted on the blinking line and does not answer the page from base and just hits the line thats blinking the page still rings for a while (loudly) till it times out. It's not a true transfer of incoming calls. They are just on hold and you page the extension and tell them to pick up line #2...Cons: I can't mute or lower the ringtone for our fax line lower than the other lines. All must ring the same loudness. SO the fax rings loudly, pain in backside."
4,Great small business phone,This was replacement for5 4 year old version and it works just as good. all of the old handset worked with no problems
1,9 Failed Handsets In 3 Months,I replaced the previous version with this model in December - Since then 9 handsets have failed and had to be returned to Panasonic for repair. This is absolutely one of the worst phone systems I have ever had.
5,Great product for paint removal; long life,"We used these to strip some old iron patio furniture. Each one lasts a long time, and we couldn't have done this project without this product."
3,DRM KIlls this game,"The game is very good, when and if you can get it to run. The DRM/Copy protection makes it hard to get it running on the pc. Sometimes we have to spend up to 15 minutes to get it started. It is so annoying that nobody tries to play it. It's too bad, it is a fun game when it works. I'd stay away from the PC version and go with the DS or Gameboy versions."
5,Time to open tose ears a little wider people,"First off a loud ""right on"" to pj from ohio. You nailed it. Hawtin created a masterpiece that makes you shiver...if you actually can shut yourself up and LISTNEN. I purchased this album last year and will never regret it. Funny it only now showed up on my recommended list from Amazon, oh well..."
4,Stark and beautiful,I enjoyed this book immensely. I grew up in the same area as Ms. Pritchett so it was easy for me to visualize the settings for the stories. I enjoyed the format: not really short stories but disconnected chapters that all had tthe same family in common. I would have liked to know more about some of the characters and the book was too short!
5,Splendid traveling companion,"I have all three dramas, and find them entertaining on the way to work. My kids enjoy them on long trips as well.I would have liked this to be longer, a match for the first one.The vocal characterizations are spot-on, and the writing is perfect for the medium. Mark Hamill does his usual splendid vocal work, and hearing this makes one almost regret Lucas didn't use Brock Peters for Vader in the movies as well. Billy Dee Williams shows a range he was not really allowed in the film. Even John Lithgow as Yoda (an idea I was skeptical of at first) worked wonderfully well. Brian Dailey wrote Han (and Empire is Han's movie, make no mistake) like no one ever has since, but he is also careful with the characterization of the others, and the expository dialogue blends smoothly into the story. (as one of my slash-writing friends commented on the Hoth shelter scene, ""You can hear them snuggling."")Highly recommended, esp if you like radio drama."
1,what the heck????,"Don't waste your time on this book, there are more valuable ones out there. First of all, what has she DONE to the fabulous story of Shahrazad? Practically torn it apart and sewed it back together with very rough stitches. I read this book trying to get away from the stereotype some writers have of typical ""weak"" women (I am partial to strong heroines with wit) and therefore thought another retelling of Shahrazad would be just the thing.Well, it turned out I was wrong and this book just had the stereotype I was looking to get away from.If you want a strong heroine, if you've been disappointed by this book and how it portrays Shahrazad, go read Cameron Dokey's version (called ""The Storyteller's Daughter). In all, that is a much more satisfying read."
3,Nice enough,"Detail in knot is very less than clear. Pendant is good weight and a good value at the price. Did not care for the necklace, a double slip knot, which kinda looked cheap and took away from the pendant."
4,Diamond in the rough,This was a great little gem of a film that really surprised me with it's performances and fun story. A real recommend for indie film lovers.
4,Horror show on wax,"If you like your Hip-Hop ultra-hard, then this is definitely a must-have. Sick, twisted lyrics over tight, thumpin' beats. This is NOT for the faint-of heart!"
2,a little disappointed,"I loved the music in the movie and expected to love the soundtrack, too. But for some reason, I don't enjoy listening to these songs on their own. It seems that I need to SEE these songs being sung. Without the video component, the intensity of the singing doesn't work for me. Instead of being moved by it, I'm made to feel uncomfortable. In its defense, I should mention that I may be older than the target age group. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and the music in that context."
4,Once I found it I had to have it.,"This soundtrack is not widely available over this side of the Atlantic, despite the location, nationality of cast and crew. Fantastic vocal and impressive instrumental work produce songs that stay with you having heard them just once."
5,Amazing album,"I usually don't buy soundtracks, but since this movie was about music it plays like a regular album. I got attached to this music instantly. It is full of beauty and soul and meaning. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of good, meaningful music as well as Glen Hansard (the guy) and The Swell Season (the name of their band for which the released an album after this movie came out)."
3,Somewhat of a downer.,"There are a few very good songs, but the overall feel of the album is rather depressing. Enjoyed the movie much more."
4,"More than ""Once""","I purchased this cd because the movie was a surprise hit for me. I abhor musicals but this one didn't feel like one. As I reached for the DVD at the video store, another customer let out a gasp and told me that the movie had an awesome soundtrack and she highly recommended it. I hadn't even solicited her opinion.She was right. I loved it. There are maybe 2 or 3 songs that I skip over but the soul of this music is beautiful. In the special features of the movie, I believe Glen Hansard describes the organic process of how this cd came to fruition. It won't be magic for everyone but for me it stuck.It's raw and just perfect for background (or foreground for that matter)music. It relaxes me on my ride home in a normally, frustrating traffic jam. But mostly, I love listening to it on my MP3 player while riding my motorcycle along an expanse of Arizona farmland with a mountain backdrop at ""the magic hour"" where the sun casts a goldeny-orange glow over the entire scene. Yum!"
5,Relive the Movie,"The music of this charming movie, ballad-like and sentimental, is what brings the characters together through their joint venture in producing a CD, now available for the viewer/listener to revisit and/or listen into their world."
5,A Rough-Cut Diamond,"I heard the buzz about this movie a few months ago and decided to give it a shot. Halfway through the film, I knew I'd have to own this soundtrack or be haunted by snippets of these tunes running through my head.""Once"" is a great amalgam of music and story. With acoustic guitar and piano at their base, these are raw tunes, full of honesty and emotion rarely found on the radio. Most American producers would've felt obligated to add frills or extra verses, or more drums, or...anything to make things more commercial. By sticking to the bare bones of the songs, Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova create rough-cut diamonds. There are five or six brilliant songs--okay, maybe seven or eight--and the rest are very good.This is one soundtrack I can't stop listening to, and it is only enhanced by the textured simplicity of the movie. What a treat."
5,Dearly love this,"So charming, sweet, sad and lovely. Marketa Irglova's voice is ethereal, complementing the brusqueness of Glen Hansard's voice. The music may take a couple of listenings to grab you, but it is honest and simple and is not muddied down with over-production. It is straight from the heart and frequently painful and real. Best tracks are Falling Slowly, If You Want Me, Say It to Me Now, and Gold. This soundtrack is so amazing, it has its own playlist on my i-Tunes."
2,small and soft,This is too small for the office chair. Might be okay for use in the car for some but definitely not for office/computer chairs.
4,Eclectic mix,"This cd crosses numerous pop and jazz influenced styles in a loose exploration of themes of redemption, sin, death and heaven. The opening songs are cool in a sort of Burt Bacharach way, then the cd moves into more aggressive sounds, with rap and electronica influences. Barry played bass for Nick Cave and worked on soundtracks, including David Lynch's Lost Highway, and his style is on the noir side. The cd infuses his brooding themes alternatively with humor (Jazz Devil, Come Hell or High Water), and with anger and desperation (Still I Rise, The Monkey Speaks His Mind).Barry's voice is gutteral and serious - he doesn't strech himself too much - but it works for the material. Very cool performance."
2,Needs improvement,"The fundamental problem with this product is that it is not sturdy enough to do the job. Instead of working easily, the two parts spread apart and the cutter doesn't completely cut into the lid. Result: can is not fully open. Heavier gauge metal in the two major parts would solve the problem for a few cents more per item. Tilting the handle down can help minimize the problem but it shouldn't take special skills or body English to operate a simple can opener."
4,Thank goodness!,"This certainly is a hearty book. Not only have I now added some DELICIOUS soups to my winter repertoire, but I feel like I've been cooking with a new friend. Warren's personal memories of each recipe and her down-home approach have made me feel truly welcomed into her culinary family. I never knew that I could learn to work quite easily with TVP, or to make a guilt-free vegan cake. I feel as if all my insecurities about vegetarian cooking have been addressed and solved by an intelligent and thorough author. Try this book--it's a feast!"
2,Unbalanced.,"Isn't the most comfortable set of tongs. They should have made the wood on the handles go all the way around , not just on the outside. This makes them unbalanced."
4,Eros without avoidance or illusion? -amor fati?,"I am a Nietzschean, and came to know of Staten via the formidable""Nietzsche's Voice"".""Eros in Mourning"" deals with the pervasiveness of the (post-Homeric) Platonic and Christian disapproval of full attachment to any mortal being; with the fear and suffering that keep this ideology alive and relevant, and with the costs involved in adhering to such an ideology. It is, overtly academic in appearance, and pursues the ""dialectics ofmourning"", (rather than mourning, as such), at the centre of various canonical western texts, culminating in Lacan. Essentially the book is about transcendence and whether we can really do without it, or whether we are capable of a dionysian perspective."
2,It was OK,"I liked this book because it showed the difference between two types of people. Kate and Lizzie used to be best friends. But now, they are fighting.These books are really easy to read. I can get thru one very quickly and then read another."
4,Good book,"This book is really fun and easy to read. It is all about Lizzie and her nemesis, Kate. The recommended age is 8-12, but if you're a fan of Lizzie Mcguire, and/or Hilary Duff, then you'll definitely want to read this book! What makes it special is Lizzie's little conscience, which says what Lizzie really wants to say!Part 1:Kate breaks her arm and she can't be a cheerleader anymore. Will she lose her popularity? Lizzie has the opurtunity to help Kate or to leave her alone. What will she decide? And will Kate accept help from an unpopular girl like Lizzie?Part 2:Lizzie, Miranda, and Gordo want to go to Kate's party. But it will be unsupervised! Mrs. Mcguire will never let this happen! How will the three friends get into the party? And what if Mrs. Mcguire find out? If she does, then it's sure to be big trouble!"
4,Easy peasy,"This inexpensive and easy-to-install device does exactly what it's supposed to. The speed adjusting screw is sensitive, FYI. 1/8 a turn will make a difference."
2,Usability poor - I'd look elsewhere,"This device seems to function OK as USB memory stick, but the poor design and quality limit its usefulness in the other functions severely. It is especially poorly suited to be an MP3 player, the small buttons are very difficult to navigate and the display is unreadable. I'm sure there are other MP3 players out there that are much better than this."
3,A little disappointed,I love Ground Force... but I really want to buy the series... This DVD is just a collection of the cast fooling around with bits here and there of them doing several different lawns. It's better than nothing.... but doesn't really give a good overall view of what this show is all about.
2,Be Careful Box had copyright 2005-2009 on It,just for men is my only source of looking decent i really depend on this to look young healthy and not like George clooney in dusk till dawn i ordered my pack of 3 and each box says copyright 2005 to 2009 if you pay attention to the item description in the middle right hand corner they mention something on the box about a new formula possibly you will see this on the new 2012 just for men packaging. I think amazon went and sent me some box that was laying in the warehouse for three years and i am not happy with that. very deceiving. Pay close attention to the right side of the box in the picture you see that says new formula cause when i received mine it did not say that and its dated 2009.
3,refreshing,"Refreshing that Michael Rothenberg has written the 'Paris Journals' ...as a relative novice to Euro travel (I spent a month or two in the Greek isles) I found that reading this great book made me want to find out for myself. It's like an open doorway leading to the psyche of an interesting friend. From beginning to end, well worth the trip..."
5,"Captivatingly suspence filled ,while emotional & believable",A believeable fiction that captures your curiosity and bonds you emotionally to the characters. You won't want to put it down!
5,Very good book,"I love mysteries, so I rarely read books like this, but I have to say this one was great. Worth much more than the price. I found myself unable to put it down. If you like books about family life, this is the book for you."
1,DVD PAL format!!!,"After reading other reviews regarding not being able to play DVD in USA on a DVD player because of PAL format, I did my own research ala Google. THEY WERE RIGHT!! Turns out in the 1960s videotaping (in Europe) used the PAL standard as opposed to the NTSC standard. So what...right? Wrong! Anything originally recorded in PAL format (converted to DVD) will most likely NOT play on USA modern DVD player. USA Region 1 modern DVD players are compatible with DVDs of original recorded NTSC format. So what that does mean? IT WON""T PLAY ON USA DVD PLAYER!!! But it will play on your computer. I for one am not likely to sit in front of my computer for 156 minutes even with my 27"" computer screen and Bose sound system."
1,blues,I cannot play this DVD on my TV but it will play on my computer. Is this because the DVD is from Germany?
4,Tones like a crystal bell,"In Suor Angelica Puccini ranges from childlike playfulness to deepest despair in a short opera easily enjoyed in one sitting. And the voices on this CD are all clear and harmonious. However I feel Bonynge's interpretation focuses on voice rather than mood. Rather than spritely as in other versions, here the tempo feels held back, dampening some of the excitement, so the listener feels as if nostalgically looking back at a distant event rather than being alive in the moment's laughter, excitement, and agony. However Dame Sutherland, of course, is incomparable, with a voice like clear light."
1,"bitterly disappointing, be warned","I owned this recording on vinyl but until I listened again to the reissued CD I had forgotten how dreadful it was. Dame Joan, whom I admired in her repertory and even sometimes outside it, was miserably miscast in this leaden reading of an opera that can soar when in the hand of singers with the temperament and musical idiom called for. It will please neither fans of the opera nor fans of the stupendous superstar in the title role, and I cannot imagine why it was dredged up out of a back catalog with so many worthier out of print recordings to choose from. Even the noble talents of Christa Ludwig were thrown away on this project - she could not save it from the dull hand on the baton and the tuneless wailing of the lead soprano, floundering in a score that had nothing in common with her gifts. Save your money."
2,Good Mixes,The theme songs for this CD are good. The Doctor Who Theme track #6 is much better than the original theme (It doesnot go off key in the first part) and the Battlestar Galatica and Deep Space Nine themes are longer because they are concert versions. It is a good CD all around.
4,Great protection for cables on carpet,bought this product specifically to keep my XLR cables from getting tripped on or chewed on by dogs during a gig. Worked great. No residue or damage to the carpet or cables.
1,Junk. Too thin and adhesive too strong. Stay away.,"What a mistake I made buying this. The tape is flimsy, very thin, but the adhesive is way too strong. It will pull paint from the wall, something a gaffer tape should not do. With a brand I bought before at a major photo brick-and-mortar and online retailer in NYC, I had none of such issues. Stay away."
3,Works fine but its not a full roll.,"As some reviewers said this tape may not be premium, but it tears and works OK. I tried using it to tape my webcam to the top of my computer monitor and it fell off, so its not that great at being sticky. For a majority of film uses I've done though it would be fine. My biggest gripe is I found some for cheaper at Best Buy after I got this, so its probably over priced for less at around $10. The length is also shorter than most rolls I am used to and I did not check/compare prior to ordering."
3,"Very nice, but very, very tight.","Pros:Construction quality is very good! The glove feels nice, looks good, and the stitches are even. They look like they will last well for just about any use.Cons:Using the tape measure around the hand sizing method, I come in at about 21.5 cm. According to the chart this is between small and medium sized hands. These medium gloves are far too tight for me. I believe the chart is off and should be updated.Note:I would give 3.5 stars if half stars were available. Overall these could be a 4.5 but since they are so tight (they started to cut off the circulation in my hand), they need to be docked that point.Update to review 11/2011:I bought the Large size, and it is ALSO very tight! It does fit, but if I try to open my thumb too far I fear I will tear the glove. I suggest buying your gloves in a store."
1,Detestable,"Damascus D20P Dyna-Thin Unlined Leather Gloves with Short Cuffs, XX-Large -are very detestable andhideous gloves...Dont throw money...I'll throw the gloves..."
2,gloves for husband,I ordered this pair of gloves for my husband who's size is 2X. The gloves were nice but he was not happy with the them as they did not cover his wrists. I did not read the product discription close enough. The gloves were for law enforcement. Which they may be good for but I was looking for a pair of dress gloves for my husband.
1,Not what I expected,"This is a good ""reference"" for someone who is seeking some surface knowledge about African Americans and their histroy, but I was hoping for a little bit more ""meat"". It is a well written text, but it is like a dictionary with very little specific insight into the subjects mentioned in the text. It gives the reader more of an overview of topics. Additionally, some very importanat people in African American history are not included in the text. If you are looking for something that is comprehensive, this is NOT the book to get. It is possible that the entire Africana would be more appropriate for my needs."
5,contact pencil cleaner,this product totally meets my needs in cleaning contacts that have coroded in hard to reach places such as camera flash battery compartments . It does the job by removing the corrosion on the contacts enabling the bsttery to make good clean contact.
2,Lights,These light are real cute and look great hanging from my tiki hut but they also have been very difficult to keep lighted. When one light goes out the whole string goes out and I am constantly fixing them.
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap!","I ordered the plastic flip flop party string lights because I had purchased two strings in Florida and wanted more to surround the patio. When I received them, I was very disappointed in the quality of the flip flops. They did not match the ones that I already had, which cost less than these through Amazon. I am going to keep them, as they are better than nothing, but I will never order anything else from this supplier. They are cheap, cheap, cheap, but they cost a pretty penny for junk.10 Plastic Flip Flop Party String Lights Beach Luau"
2,CHeap. Not at all what I expected,I'm not sure what possessed me to go by the way these lights look in the picture. I purchased them for my balcony and the line is so short it barely hangs a quarter through and my balcony is not that large. It's about 8 little 99 cent store quality painted flip flops with (only pro) what appears to be bright lighting. I still intend to use them but I'll have to buy more because the line is so short (again only 8 or so flip flops). Hopefully I'll find in a store for less money.
2,Was not happy,I bought these lights for a camping trip. Out of three sets one did not work. Since I was leaving for camping a few days later it did not pay to send them back so I pulled apart another set of lights to use. Also one of the lights was crushed and two of the lights were not the same as the rest. Would not order from them again.
4,"Wow, I feel the burn with this one","I ordered this DVD based on an Amazon recommendation. When I first put this DVD in and was watching it I was thinking ""oh, this is too easy"" and I also found it a bit irritating that their instruction is voiced over rather than them talking live while they're doing the exercises. However once I started doing the exercises and my muscles started BURNING I changed my tune... so simple and so effective. And after a while the voice-over didn't bother me at all. This is a great workout that goes by quickly and will challenge your muscles immediately, I like it especially because sometimes I'm just not in the mood to do cardio which all my other DVDs (except my pilates DVD) have. The only negative is that (like other people have said) is that the breathing/positioning instructions take a bit too long and I'd rather that we just got right into doing the exercise. However, I'm going to see what other DVDs they have that people recommend."
4,Intense workout,"The Core Fusion body sculpt workout is an intense strength workout. It works just about every muscle group in your body and if you follow it from beginning to end you will feel it the next day. And the next. AND THE NEXT! lol Seriously I am in pretty good shape and this workout had me aching from head to toe.The only problem I see with the dvd is there is no cardio workout. Now we also use The Firm full body workout which incorporates cardio with strength training however its focus is more cardio-oriented, i.e. step aerobics.We like to mix things up so I can see doing the Firm's full body with cardio one day, followed by a body sculpt workout the next then a day off. Rinse and repeat.Overall I am happy with the purchase of Core Fusion body sculpt and can easily recommend it to anyone who wants an effective strength training for their entire body."
3,Meh.,"I was really, really excited about this - until I realized it requires weights & a chair, neither of which I have in my small NY apartment. Now I'm not excited about it at all. Plus, the husband is a little creepy & I don't like watching him work out, but I guess I should have thought of these things beforehand."
1,Bought it on a whim..,"I bought this item because amazon said it was ""frequently bought"" with another DVD I wanted to buy. So, I purchased this item on a whim. I do not like it at all. It is very easy to hurt yourself by doing these moves the wrong way. IF you were taught these very difficult exercises in a gym-setting with a trainer, then you might get something out of this DVD. But if you don't really know what you're doing (and ESPECIALLY if you're a novice), this isn't for you.Also, personally, I found the 2 people on the DVD annoying and uninspiring. If I trained rich people in NYC and had all day to work out and do yoga, I'd look like them too! But I can't and I don't."
2,kinda boring,I honestly was bored and ended up giving to a friend. I did a couple times but I prefer/recommend bar method.
5,FABULOUS!,"This is a great DVD, even though it would be nice to have a little more direction from the instructors. Still, it gives you a great workout and makes you feel great when you are finished."
5,Better than I thought,"I have little hope a workout video would provide a good workout or even keep my attention. I was surprised by this dvd. The reviews were good so I thought I might as well try it, couldn't hurt. The exercises are quick and you can feel the burn after (know you're doing something right). I'm hooked now and am trying the other dvds!"
5,"Excellent, I totally enjoyed this video",This is a great stretch workout cardio no but stretch YES and people you NEED to stretch :-) I have arthritis and this kind of video helps
1,Boring!,"This is just too slow! If you want something energetic, pass this one. I started to fall asleep..."
2,Easily Lost Interest!!,"I was looking for a good strategy/builder game like Majesty 2 or 1701 A.D. This was definitely not it. I now see why there are no extra photos on Amazon. This game was very old school in my opinion, frustrating and boring. Instead of walking you through a tutorial, the game simply had pop-up windows that told you what to do, like my memory is that long! All you do is drive your troops from one location to the next on top of a geographical map...literally! If you are looking for a interactive game, do not get this one. I am surprised the same folks that created Majesty created this game too. I wish they would come out with more economic strategy games like Majesty."
1,Iceberg floating near Naples,"I agree with the first reviewer. I read the critic in an opera magazine (who is probably in love with Dimitri) and immediately bought this one. The orchestra is rich, the voice is so nice and deep but the energy is not there. If you love Pavarotti and Stefano singing these songs, and if you like Leo Nucci doing these, you probably would agree with us that this album does not work at all."
2,For the money you can do better,"While this looks pretty nice, there are just too many problems, initally the company sent the wrong legs, which they corrected after a few days, but once assembled, the slats turned out to be cut wrong, the finish leaves a lot to be desired. Find something else."
4,A Good Read!,"Richard L. Daft and Robert H. Lengel present a new model of leadership. They contrast fusion leadership with traditional fission leadership that is based upon dividing the workplace into roles and tasks based on position and function. The book draws on many of the new ideas in management and leadership based on notions of chaos, change, creativity, intuition, personal empowerment, dialogue, future search and other principles. It mixes new science, spirituality and New Age thinking. While some readers may view these ideas as a welcome change from the traditional, rational approach to management, others may find them overly mushy and touchy-feely. However, within the growing genre of soft-leadership style books, it is well-written and well organized. We at getAbstract recommend this book to executives interested in non-traditional leadership approaches."
4,A useful guide...,I didn't get mine until I was 86% finished with the Game.I really used it for the rest. It really saved me alot of internet time by looking at online guidebooks.Now I've beaten the final boss.
1,Huge Ripoff - Lexmark should be ashamed!,"Even on lowest quality setting, this cartridge will only print about 100 pages of text. Shame on Lexmark! Deserves zero stars!"
3,Cost is not rationa!?!?!!,"Lexmark has always overpriced their cartridges, but please tell me why a black monochrome cartiridge should cost more than the colored mate (170060)?"
3,Good slipper for the price,"I'll start with my cons:Others are correct when saying they are narrow- the fabric stretches to fit a wider foot but the padding is very narrow. I suspect as I break them in the padding will flatten to cover the entire bottom of my foot. I've already found this to be the case and really don't have that much of my foot ""hanging"" off the padding.Back seam tears into my heel- if I don't wear them for long periods of time, they are fine. If I do a lot of walking, they kill my heels.Pros:Super cuteCons aside they are comfyCan't beat the priceI'm not as turned off by the cons as others might be and I'm happy enough with my purchase but once these are done, I won't be buying another pair."
5,great slippers,"I've worn this type of slipper for many years, they're very light, comfortable and easy and fit nicely into a suitcase when traveling."
5,Perfect,"These slippers were for my daughter, after she started using mine when visiting. They are very comfortable and extremely durable ... I drop them in the washer with other dark colors and hang to dry!"
5,Great Gift,"This is the gift to give the women in your life who can appreciate comfort and classic style. Cushioned inner soles, sturdy bottom soles, soft and beautiful upper material, no pressure points, perfect fit, warm, classic style that goes with pajamas and jeans, stands up to machine washings--what more can you ask from a house shoe? Give yourself the gift of these slippers, too, in every color."
5,"The only slippers I wear, love them.","I have worn this type of slipper for the last 16 years at least. They fit inside my large winter boots and this way I don't lose my socks when I take the boots off. Also, easy conforming to your foot."
4,Good basic slipper,"Good basic slipper. I'm a size 8 1/2 and bought the large...OKAY fit, maybe could have gone up a size since they are pretty close to the toes, but overall comfortable."
2,pain in the heel.,"I bought these because of the good reviews and they looked cute. First they don't look as cute on my feet as expected. Second they hurt the back of my foot, the elastic band rubbers on my what I think is my achilles. The only positive is that they have nice cushioning and what I believe to be a leather bottom. I am hoping that the elastic stretches out some over time and stops hurting. I am going to get the bandaids out right now!"
2,BEWARE: Just A Slide Show!,"This is NOT an awesome concert featuring some of GRP's best musicians but a crummy, random slide show of people doing winter activities. This video is no good unless you like random slideshows of people you don't know."
4,Fun page-turner,"Fun, if your tastes run towards the gruesomely absurd! A ""horror"" novel that makes no apologies about its titillatingly singular purpose of grossing you out. This was my first Laymon read, and it wont be my last! As other reviewers have well articulated, his pacing was fast - it's a real page-turner,perfect for your next plane/train/bus ride. I found the twist ending a particularly ""twisted"" way to end the book.All in all a fun time killer for you other sickos,just know what you're getting in to! My only regret is having missed his stuff in the past,but it appears most of his stuff is currently in print so im gonna snatch 'em up while I can!"
3,It's Okay...,"Pros: Good price; Easy to fold/unfold; Easy to push; Good canopy; Pretty solid strollerCons: Seats are not very comfortable or stable. They are soley supported by an adjustable strap that lowers or raises the seat. My twin girls always seemed to be uneven when sitting. I don't mean at different levels. I mean the left part of the back was sinking deeper than the right or vice versa.Also, I think for an avid jogger-someone who runs on a straight path for a long time- it would be just fine. For me though, I am more of a fast paced walker. I like walking in my neighborhood and along paths. The stationary front wheel makes it very hard to turn or even make a simple bend in the road. You have to constantly pick up the front end. It just wasn't for me. I returned this and am getting a swivel front wheel jogger, which gives you the option to lock the front wheel."
2,Not all stationary front wheel joggers are this hard to use,"I have used a Schwinn jogging stroller the past 2 years with my twins (now 2 & 1/2). The stroller was great, but something in the seat broke so I was forced to shop around for a new stroller.I was pleasantly surprised to see the changes that Baby Trend made to this jogger since the last time I shopped joggers. The moveable canopy is a plus as is the parent tray, so I decided to give it a try.This stroller is so hard to turn. I was used to a stationary wheel jogger with my other stroller, but this stroller is just not set up right. The weight isn't distributed properly to allow for an easy push down on the handle bar to lift the front wheel.I used it once, then packaged it up and returned it. I just wanted others to know that not all joggers with stationary wheels are this hard to use.I decided to go with the Dreamer Design. A little more than double the price of this stroller, but definitely well worth it if you use your jogger frequently."
1,INSANITY,"I thought, wow, something for my new one to sit in and my autistic six year old to sit in. Yikes, this thing was horrible. I spent one afternoon in the mall and then drove straight to the store and returned it. Okay, it's a jog stroller, but the thing doesn't turn. I had to keep it in ""wheelie"" mode in order to turn it on a bend. I did get a workout, my arms! Don't frustrate yourself and buy it. It's only one more obstacle to add into a mom's busy day. I am on my third child and this is my fourth stroller. I was looking for something to keep my autistic one contained (he's a runner) and free up my arms with the baby. I am on the wait list for the sit n stand. That was my first choice and now I will be patient. I'll have to live without an adult cup holder, but my sanity will be worth it. Trust me, no other feature is worth anything on this stroller if you can't even manuever it. Skip this stroller.Rein"
4,Good Eating,"I have been preparing sourdough pancakes and waffles for over 25 years using dozens of methods and techniques, but the simple recipe on pg 56 beats them all for flavor, texture, and overnite preparation! The Sour Cream Silver Dollar pancakes and the Cornmeal Blueberry Cakes are a tie for second place at our breakfast table. I would rate this little book 5 stars, but I haven't tried more than about four of the recipes-yet. As they say, enjoy!"
3,"Great recipes, really unappealing book","This book is very small and has no pictures, so it loses points for me in that regard. I love to see at least a few pictures of what I'm going to be making when I'm flipping through a cookbook. Since it's so small, it's also very difficult to have the book open when cooking (it wants to immediately fold back closed). That being said, it does have some nice, tasty recipes."
2,Disappointed Waffles,"I got this little book to go specifically with the Hamilton Beach Waffle maker thinking that it would be a good companion. Unfortunately there is only 1 basic waffle recipie and it requires yeast and time for raising. Most of the others (only 10) are rather too fancy: Carrot-Raisin, Orange Chocolate-Chip, Cheddar Bacon, Peanut Butter... I'm sure that some are valid, but I've already lost interest. On the other hand, the recipies included with the Owners Manual for the waffle maker are very doable. Can't comment on the pancake recipies but on first sight they seem more appealing."
4,Fabulous,"This shade offers far more extensive sun shading than the typical shades on strollers. My only complaint was there were no instructions to help attach it correctly. Fortunately, it's not the kind of thing that requires a Mensa membership to figure out. ; ). This has been a fantastic addition for keeping my little ones more comfortable."
2,"It works, sorta",We have the single but had to make adjustments for it not to flip backward and also to keep it low enough. The double has the same issues; it's not sturdy enough for even a modest wind.
4,Almost perfect product,"Just got a Video iPod and someone told me I had to get a case to provide it. After reading a bunch of reviews I settled on the eVo3. It is really great -- it really protects the iPod, but seems to allow all the funcationality one would want. It's sleek, and if used properly, really works.BUT: as a runner, I really wish that eVo3 made an armband to go along with the case. The case has a belt clip on it which is okay, but I would not recommend for heavy activities..."
2,Hope you don't need it immediately,"I think the iSkin is a good product but they should fire the COO. I say ""I think"" because I still haven't received it after ordering before Christmas.The customer service off of the Amazon site is ridiculous and the amazon@iskin.com is invalid. I had to track down iSkin off of their own site. The customer service rep was very nice but it still took over 1 month to get the exchange. Furthermore, their logistics in receiving and shipping is appallling. Hopefully the Apple store (retail) will carry this product soon or else good luck with the delivery."
4,You'll like this in spite of yourself,I'm not a zydeco fan but heard this in a store and really enjoyed it. Several songs in this collection are quite good; most are above average.
5,WUNDERBAR!!,"Pls don't stop making this sort of coupling, instead keep making similar series.Such as a little bit closet to popular numbers vg. musicals etc."
5,Great power source!,"If you're going to prolong the life of a U.P.S., this battery will do that. It is very easy to install."
2,"Well, if this doesn't wake you up, NOTHING will.","The folks at Starbucks are not exaggerating when they say their French Roast coffee is ""Extra Bold."" In fact, they should probably call it `Extremely Bold'...or maybe even `Ridiculously Bold.' The directions on the package recommend 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of filtered water. The result is likely to disintegrate your ceramic mug before you can drink it, but it doesn't taste too bad...that is until the bitter aftertaste kicks in and makes your throat burn. If you weaken it by adding some hot water, as the package suggests, the bitter taste becomes more pronounced, like coffee that's been left heating in the pot too long. The only way to drink this coffee is with plenty of cream and sugar. With enough cream and sugar, French Roast is pretty good; but I wouldn't recommend this particular Starbucks variety if you like your coffee black...unless you wanna stay awake for a week."
5,Great Book,A non cynical and practical view of how Machiavelli's principles of statecraft are applicable to everyday life. The author's use of modern figures lends credence to his arguments.
1,Superficial and shallow,"Obviously written for an American readership, this book is specious, shallow and facile. Revealing little understanding of the times or context in which Machiavelli's works were completed, it is suitable only for those seeking a bastardised view of Machiavelli's thought."
2,Very thin gruel,"If you want to learn anything about Machiavelli, read Strauss or Mansfield. Old Nick's presence here seems to be nothing more than a ""hook"" or marketing gimmick. Nonetheless, this book is useful if only for its emphasis on the need always to be armed and vigilant. With that, Machiavelli would agree."
3,Raven's Exile,"A meditation on the Green River, water in the West, and wilderness.I first read Meloy's EATING STONE, a book about desert bighorns. In comparison to that book, where the specificity of the theme reined in the author's imagination somewhat, RAVEN'S EXILE ranges widely. I think it should be read as a meditation/rant rather than as a factual account or even a memoir. At times the language is poetic; at other times I found it imprecise and over-the-top. Sometimes Meloy's outrage at American culture's lack of concern for wilderness, the hubris of building huge cities in the middle of the desert, and the arrogance of wanting to replace native fish with others that give better ""sport"" is acutely expressed and trenchant; sometimes the text degenerates into idiosyncracy and misanthropy.Recommended, but I tend to think Craig Childs' book on water in the desert addresses the topic better."
5,Tea Drinking Husband,"I was tired of the tea boxes in my pantry, taking up space, so I decided to order this Tea Storage Box for my husband. Now he has his collection of teas all neatly stored in this beautiful box on the kitchen counter and doesn't have to ramage through the pantry trying to find ""that"" particular tea he may be searching for."
4,"5 stars for looks, 3 for function = 4","I do like my tea box, but I use tea that is in individual packets, and so the squares are just a wee bit too small to stuff them into! I still cram them in there by bending them a bit, but if they were a bit larger then the presentation (that's what it is all about, right?) would be nicer.Otherwise, I like the craftsmanship."
4,Perfect,Gave as a gift and was well received. Holds a bunch of tea bags. The color is a natural stained bamboo.
5,Perfect!,"This is a really sturdy box. It doesn't take up too much space, it isn't too heavy, and it's well-made. Love it!"
4,Great fun!,"This is a great way to keep the kids involved while making the ice cream. I have a friend who teaches elementary school and has me in with both our ice cream balls every year when covering the letter ""i"". The kids LOVE rolling the ball, though we do have to watch after them and make sure they don't THROW them."
1,A mason jar and a marble work better!,"You don't need this questionable product to make ice cream. Just put your pre-chilled ingredients into a clean mason jar, add a clean marble or two and alternate between shaking and rolling the jar around on the floor and putting it into the freezer for a few minutes to keep it cold. Or you can use a gallon plastic ziplock bag and the marbles and squish and squeeze the bag. My kids make ice cream this way all the time. If you are camping just put it into a cooler of ice occasionally to chill it instead of the freezer. It works, it's cheap and easy and it's much easier to clean than this thing!"
2,Seems overpriced,"Sure, it's fun to make ice cream this way once in a while as a novelty, but I've been making ice cream in a similar fashion just using a pair of emptied out coffee cans (nest the little one inside the big one, with the salt and ice packed between them) for years. I guess what you're getting for your $30 is something that's cuter than a coffee container. Personally, I'd pass on the cuteness and pocket the $30."
2,not too useful,"take very long time to make icecream, and not very creamy, a lot of ice. Maybe fun the first time, but now it has been sitting there in storage."
2,two ziplock bags do the same thing.,"Any boyscout worth 1/2 his salt already knows you can do the same thing with two ziplock bags. You'll need some gloves but the principal is the same. Ice in a bigger bag, mix in the smaller one and put smaller bag in the bigger bag and let the kids toss it around. Might want some gloves but boys love tossing the bag around at the camp. Gives them something to do. Don't need a gimick."
3,Don't Over Tighten!!!,"If you buy this overpriced contraption, make sure NOT to tighten the ice cream compartment lid too much. When the unit gets cold, it contracts around the lid making it impossible to open.Extra lids are available because the only way to get it open after that is to break it."
2,making ice cream,takes a while to make. the ingredients are easy to have on hand. hard to clean up. the ice cream is good.
4,Rockin' and Rollin' Ice Cream Ball,"We purchased this ball for our family get-together and our 8 grandchildren rolled it on the floor. We made vanilla, chocolate, cookies and cream and mint chocolate. The vanilla was the best, because there was a recipe--we made the others up, but they were good. I'm buying a quart-sized ball for a Christmas present. The kids loved making their own and they LOVED the ice cream."
4,Play and Freeze Mega Ice Cream,We purchased it for the grandkids for Chrismas and it was worth it. Fun to do with the kids and it tastes like the old time ice cream we use to make with the hand crank. It does take some time rolling the ball to make the ice cream but that is what you expect. Very tastey!
4,This is a great gift,This is a great gift for kids in any age group. I t is very fun and it keeps you active.It great for kids who like to make homade food.The only problem is its not so durable mine broke and cracked when it feel on bricks.If you have any questions or comments email me at dreyerolivia@gmail.com
1,Don't bother.,"It takes half an hour of rolling, at least 5# of ice, and THEN you find out that there is a good chance the rubber seal is defective. Used it once, and sending it back."
3,"Fun, but a lot of work!","My husband and I used this to make ice cream with our 5-year old daughter. It was fun, but got a little bit long in the end. It was also heavy for her to push back and forth to us, especially for that amount of time. We used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream, so it did warn us that it would take longer. At any rate, the final product was surprisingly good, and the concept was very fun. We will use it again, but probably not for a little while."
1,Play and Freeze Ice Cream Maker (The Ice Cream Ball),First time we used the ball it fell out of my hands onto our hardwood floor and cracked 3/4 of the way around... What a waist... and a very expensive one time novelty Toy...!
5,Play and freeze ice cream maker,I bought this for my nieces and nephew. The kids had fun making ice cream from the half and half at our Christmas party.
4,worked great,purchased this and took it too a family reunion. Everyone had fun taking turns making the icecreaam and it was a huge hit. The icecrem disappeared and there were requests for more the next night.
1,Ice Cold Lumpy Cream,"We used ""the ball"" tonight. We used the best ingredients and followed the directions. Total of 40 minutes of rolling, two loads of ice and a midway stir. The result? Ice cold lumpy cream. We had fun, but not sure we will do it again.Hi. I liked the ice cream,but when we were finished making the ice cream it turned out thin and I liked thin but it wasn't the way we wanted it to be. So that is just what we wanted to tell you."
4,Ice Cream maker,kids loved it...easy to operate and ice crean turned out well. They can't wait to try and add other ingredients for other kinds.
5,We loved this over Thanksgiving!,I got one of these for Thanksgiving and we tried it with the family. It makes great vanilla ice cream and then we moved on to more exotic recipes. Try almond ice cream by adding some almond extract and a quarter cup of chopped almonds. It also makes a great boysenberry ice cream (just add boysenberry syrup). I am buying a second one because we have a big family and want to feed a bunch. It works great and I intend to give it as a gift for xmas!
3,So So At Best,"It is very confusing to me why it took toby so long to come up with such a disapointing release. The track list is decieving for listing eighteen tracks when there are so many pieces of songs within them. These tracks should have been added to other tracks as intros, for the buyer gets a feeling of being short-changed. Although, the album is well produced and toby really shows his talent in the production of this album, but the large number of remakes and samples really shows toby's weakness in the songwriting department. There are a few excellent tracks such as, ""Yours"" and ""JTrain"" a great funk song featuring Kirk Franklin, but overall this release was disapointing and I hope to hear some of Toby's ""OWN"" material in the near future."
4,Suits me to a tea...,"I find this tea very tasty, not high in caffine. Not sure if it is helping with weight loss or not, but I do sleep better on the nights that I drink it after dinner. I wish the box had and English ingredients list, there is nothing in English on the box. Good thing I know how to make tea...."
3,Not bad...but not for a real workout.,"I like the bike, but the tension is not very strong. Even the highest setting doesn't take a lot of effort. It would be perfect for an elderly person who is trying to stay in shape and is looking for a low impact way of doing it. It is very comfortable. If you are looking for a hard workout this is not for you."
4,par man,"I would recommend this to anyone. The only problem I encountered is with my heighth. I am 6' 1"", and I am a little cramped when I use it. Other than the length, it is great."
1,Defective wheel/stabilizing bar,"This bike arrived with a defective wheel - it would not budge. Additionally, the back clamp that should go into the back stabilizer bar was welded improperly, so it would not fit. I actually read about these same problems for this product in a couple other reviews on Amazon. I guess like almost anything - you take your chances. It was just a pain to have it shipped back for a refund."
2,Not one of Hightower's best novels!,"I was turned on to Hightower by my mother. The first novel I read was Flashpoint (which is one of her best). This is the second Hightower book I have read. It is at a much lower standard than Flashpoint. During the first few chapters, the author skips from several different characters that have no link. I had to keep looking back to see how they fit into the plot. It is not apparent until the last fifty pages how they fit together. Even at that point, I still am confused! The novel was slow going and confusing. I recommend Flashpoint over this novel!"
2,Rubbish,"At times the singer - who is a sixteen year-old girl - sounds very much like well, a sixteen year old girl fronting a half-decent metal outfit. Her singing is terrible, off-key and clearly been overproduced to hide just how out of tune she is.When she starts screaming - which is actually an improvement on the singing, she sounds exactly like Kittie, that other all-girl metal band who actually released a couple of good metal tunes.There is little on here that actually deserves spending money on. As a warm-up live band they could be okay (after you had a couple of beers), but don't waste your money on this half-arsed, heavy metal copycats."
5,Imaginative!,My son (4.25 years old) is so taken with this book! He loves the pictures and the plot. It's the perfect mix for a child who likes to live dangerously!
3,Good printer but obtaining cartridges is a real pain.,"For the price, it is difficult to beat this printer's performance. However, there is the hidden cost of trying to obtain replacement ink cartridges. As shipped, the box only contains the color cartridge. You must buy the most often used black cartridge seperately. Be prepared to wait an inordinate amount of time for anything labled ""Lexmark"" to be shipped. Two or more weeks before shipping is a real possibility."
3,"Fairly original premise,","Well, the best thing about this one is the story is fresh, hasn't been run into the ground. Some traces of ""Hostel"", but not nearly as much gore and extreme violence. Decent plot twists here and there. Fairly surprising ending. Acting is mediocre/okay.Worth a watch if you dig horror, thrillers, dark subject matter."
4,The Ending,"Now that's an ending that will stay with you for a very long time. Very deep and heartbreaking ending. I forwarded through most of the movie but it looks pretty good, not bad at all. I just wanted to see what happened in the end and wow that was really something."
4,Good Book!,The author brilliantly described the human anatomy and laid out in-depth information. Good book for those who are studying human anatomy and good aid to help you excel at your study.
1,Horrible acting,I watched this with my mom. The acting was some of the worst either of us have ever seen. The story was also extremely predictable.
5,Christmas Lodge Review,Christmas Lodge is a beautiful family/Christian movie that my wife and I will enjoy watching over and over down through the coming years. It is worth every penny we paid for it and we both highly recommend it.
5,THOMAS KINKADE CHRISTMAS LODGE,"HERE IS ANOTHER OUTSTANDING MOVIE BY THOMAS KINKADE, ABOUT YOUNG WOMEN WHO GETS DUMPED BY HER BOYFRIEND, ITHINK INMY OPINON LOVES THE OUTDOORS, SHE MEETS SOMEONE FROM THE PAST AND THEN THE EXCITEMENT BEGINS, I DON'T WANT TO SAYTO MUCH, BUT THIS MOVIE IT TRIFFIC AND HAS A WONDERFUL FAMILY ENDING, I AM SURE ALOT OF YOU WILL ENJOY THIS MOVIE.I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE AT FIRST FROM AMAZON, BECAUSE THOMAS KINKADE CAME OUT WITH ANOTHER MOVIE CALLED THE CHRISTMASCOTTAGE, AND IT WAS AN OUTSTANDING MOVIE ABOUT A YOUNG ARTIST JUST STARTING OUT (THOMAS KINKADE) YOU WILL LOVETHIS MOVIE AS WELL, AND I ALSO BOUGHT THIS FROM AMAZON."
1,do not bother,"I too hated this movie. It is contrived and the ""Christianity"" is not biblical Christianity, just religiosity. I got tired immediately of the way Mary was so perfect in every area of her life, and her city boyfriend was ridiculed by all. nauseating. After a while, I was actually rooting for him, although nothing wrong with the lodge guy. In this movie, if you don't adore the outdoors at all times. Sorry I bought it."
2,Disappointed,I have to say that I am a bit of a sap when it comes to Christmas movies. I was disappointed in this movie. Not at all what I thought is was. I may have liked it if I was 10 years old.
4,Christmas Lodge Movie,It was very family and romantic-type movie. It showed that the living for others and trusting that in a bad or hard time good things can be possible. Very beautiful scenary and uplifting to watch and hear.
2,Average,"I received it as a gift, and i found it rather boring. It reminds me a little of Coldplay, but without the energy. I would suggest instead you to buy Coldplay's A Rush of Blood To The Head, a great LP about the same price."
4,Good Gift,This was a secret Santa gift and it was very good. My secret Santa was pleased with the movie. Good buy.
2,Lifeless... listless... unengaging... boring.,"Okay, so here we have Commissioner Gordon: Year One... errr, I mean Batman: Year One.It saddens me to say, but this is not very good. I'm sure most people are familiar with original comic. All the best elements of the story have already been appropriated into two VASTLY superior movies:Batman - Mask of the PhantasmandBatman Begins [Blu-ray]The horrible, wooden actor from The O.C. is a horrible, wooden Bruce Wayne/Batman here. This whole movie is pretty lifeless. Batman is a barely a subplot and side character here. This is Lt. Gordon's movie. Really... Mask of the Phantasm is so much better than this. You actually care about the characters in that movie, and they are fully drawn out. For all you fans of the comic who don't listen to reviews and must be disappointed for yourself, at least save yourself some cash and rent this instead of buying it."
5,q,"This was an excellent adaptation of Batman, It follows a slightly different intro story than I'm used to but if anything its a nice change of pace. I recommend this movie highly for anyone with a three digit IQ. :)"
4,good,pretty good movie. reveled a few things about the characters that I had not know before and added some depth to them.
1,"Don't trust them,","This book may have good information. But do you want to trust someone who wants to promote ""Messianic Judaism,"" yet except for small print, makes their book cover look like a Jewish text. If they are not open and honest about this, what else are they not open and honest about?Change the cover to be more revealing. Don't be sneaky. Would Jesus want you to behave this way?"
1,Not a Real Passover Haggadah,"This book is propaganda promoting the ""Jews for Jesus"" version of Christianity. It is not a 'Jewish' book. Be forewarned before you purchase this book."
4,A unique ending for a fantasy trilogy,"Just as all the pieces appear to be falling into place... we get a surprise ending. You may find it anticlimactic, or you may look back at the trilogy and try to come to terms with its conclusion. Perhaps Tol is not the altruist we misconstrued him as being, but rather motivated by honor and strong personal loyalties.I like the role that Thompson and Cook assign to Fate; it's reminiscent of Greek or Roman mythology, in which one man is destined by the Gods to become a hero. Here, however, the authors give our hero free choice."
1,Beautiful Bikes,I have been into Indian motorcycles since I was a kid. One of the lucky ones-my dad held on to his. I have run into so many people like the person selling this book @$450. Whatever happened to trying to keep the spirit alive? These old bikes are becoming fewer and fewer. We should work together to preserve the declining number. I would like to know who this person is and black list them from all Antique motorcycle clubs and events!
3,Digital Remastering sucks!,"If you enjoy nostalgia, don't buy anything Digitally Remastered. The sound is too polished, too clean, too homogenized. It lacks life. Gross!"
3,This Import is PAL formatted,"Just a short review to say that, although I am sure I will like this video; if you have an el-cheapo (like me) DVD player.....wait for the April 1 release also shown on search page. I ordered this import and although the specifications shows it NTSC....it is actually PAL formatted (European) In fact, it has PAL printed on DVD. My regular DVD player will not play it (it ejects on insert). My GoVideo DVD-R will play it but video has horizonal lines running thru it and is unwatchable. So if you order this import, BE SURE your DVD player will play PAL format!!"
2,it was ok,"i saw justin timberlake's show on hbo back during labor day weekend and i felt the overall concert was just alright. the band was tight and the audience was into,but Justin TImberlake just couldn't bring the good for two hours and change. the songs had a good pacing,but Timberlake never found his groove all the way. he didn't command that stage like he needed to.for all the hype and built up the show underwhelms for me. but it was ok. the dancing and overall band and dancers were good. vocals were hit and miss to me."
4,Future Sex Love Show-Justin Timberlake,"I like Justin's music but I am not a Superfan, and I was pleasantly surprised. The concert takes place at Madison Square Garden and is in the round. Justin belts out many of his solo hits and the NSync track Gone, record producer Timbaland joins Justin for Sexy Back and another song. I use concert dvds to workout while on the exercise bike and I am able to get at least an hour of up tempo songs from this concert. The band, background singers and dancers make this an eventful and enjoyable show."
5,Another winner,"I did the body sculpt and got fascinated by the results. This one is very good to do with the other one because the exercises are very different. This one like the title tells you will get more Pilates exercises. In this video like on the other you work the whole body and I really like that, I have problem areas too but I believe that you have better results if you use your whole body. I forgot to say this in the other exhale reviews but the music I great in all of them."
4,Great Mind-Body Exercises,"This is a really relaxing exercise dvd and yet it's also a good workout. The pure core section is very challenging. I reserve one day a week for stretching exercises and this is the dvd that I use for that, although it is not technically a stretching dvd. The voice-over instruction is very good and it is easy to follow. Overall I'm glad I bought it and I look forward to it every Saturday."
5,Amazing Workouts Even for the Most Experienced!,"As a certified personal trainer and fitness instructor for over 12 years, these workouts are amazing! No matter how experienced or strong you think you are, these workouts will challenge you. If you have Direct TV, several of these workouts are available on Fit TV channel 261 also."
1,Would not recommend,"Bought this shed last year, thought it was a great deal but it was too good to be true. The vinyl siding is paper thin, secured in place by a plastic pole every 15 inches or so. I would not trust leaving any expensive equipment inside. Anyone could kick the siding and bust the shed. After trying to put everything in place, I decided to throw in the towel and return the shed. I wouldn't recommend this shed to anyone."
5,Perfect!!!!,I bought these mats for my new car. I was worried because I could not find any to fit the way I wanted. These are perfect and the colors match with the color of my car.
3,CD: Long Journey Home,CD in fine shape but packaging just so-so. Wouldn't say very good. Delivery a tad slow -7 or 8 days to receive.
1,complete waste of money,"I am incredibly disappointed in this. IMHO, it is a complete waste of money. It is very difficult to use. The pliers are always in the way and have to be manipulated before you can use ANYTHING. The ""ruler"" is useless. There are no scissors. I own a Gerber Suspension which is light years ahead of this piece of junk."
3,Another mediocre multitool...,"I am a network technician and like all tech's I carry a multitool.I just bought a paratool and this is what I found. The tilting plier heads are a nice idea but when they are at an angle you can't really use it because it DOESN'T LOCK at an angle so you can't put any force on it without causing the tool to close. In other words the tilting plier heads don't work well. Opening the tool requires two hand's, unlike the leatherman tool's that you can whip open single handedly like a butterfly knife. This is a hassle. The wire cutter's are to small to easily cut Cat-5 cable. All of the blades are removable, which is a cool idea, but SOG does not offer any real ""variety"" of replacement blades so this feature is kind of worthless. This knife is built very solid and is extremely comftorable to hold, but I could not recommend that anyone buys it. My advice would be to stick with a leatherman."
5,part of one of the best series around,"the previous reviewer hit all the high spots. i'm submitting a review to let potential phyrne lovers know that there are more fans of this series.greenwood writes wonderfully--there's humor, suspense, excitement in all the books, and wonderfully twisty, tricky plots. and good grammar, which is delightful to me and getting to be non-existent in american writing. there's a definite flavor of the golden age of mystery writing, too, suitable for the 1928 setting.ms. greenwood is obviously an adult, perceptive, well-read, wordly, and experienced person (as one would hope from a pro bono attorney, which she is). this adds depth to her writing. her books can be read and re-read--the mystery is only part of the attraction."
1,Why?,"Why on earth would you need a strategy guide for a button smashing game? The only thing it might have useful is hidden characters and levels, but that is easily found on the Internet."
4,"bought this for dr.jekyll vs the werewolf,and it looks good","already had ""moon of the wolf"" and this one looks ok,but even though it's not a great print""dr. jekyll vs the werewolf"" is a very nice if not great transfer,but if you get into movies like this , you'll want a copy of this cheese ball spanish horror movie. it's just fun. i still want it in letterbox though."
4,Slim Jewel Cases,I ordered the product and it arrived in a short time. It is exactly what I needed. Thank you very much.
2,Jewel Case Review,These jewel cases are not very good for music CDs if you carry them around as I do. They tend to pop out of their center holder and are liable to get scratched. Perhaps they are meant for storage purposes only?
5,A Sound Track to a Movie,"Purchased as a Gift for someone that wanted this particular item, they are happy with it, it was sent quickly and arrived in good shape and was everything it was represented to be by the vendor."
1,Fried's Work,"...may be honest (as, I suppose, literalism is or mostly can be), but in many ways, it's like the fall of the middle class. Thank the Lord that that we have a ground, or else we might fall below it....[In response to the title of 'Realism, Writing, Disfiguration': misfortunately, I'm Berkeley alumna, '00, and happened upon a form of ""mental illness"" that is officially called schizo affective disorder. After failing to complete graduate studies in art history, I'm convinced that Fried's ideas or observations were used to FML.]"
5,Cowboy boots - WOW,"My five year old grandson loved these well made boots, and wore them constantly for weeks. They are still his favorite pair of shoes, and I bought them three months ago to finish off his cowboy costume for Halloween Definitely a good buy well made, they do not show wear at all."
4,A basic multi-tool,I have a leatherman that I feel is better than this model but the SOG does the job that I need it for. It's a good back up to my Leatherman.
4,Discoveries,"For discoverers of Bayrakdarian there is not a lot here, but it shows a different aspect by moving into Mozart. I don't see much emotion here yet, just a voice; but her two mates are discoveries on their own part, at least for me. I was impressed, and will look for their names again....Lovely singers, both."
4,Bang for your buck,"Strengths:Inexpensive. Great contrast ratio. Good brightness. VGA & DVI Connections. 5 ms pixel response time. 3 yr warranty.Weaknesses:No height adjustment. Non-powered speakers (barely audible). No DVI cable. Have to go into the OSD menu to switch between inputs.Summary:I was able to get this for about $213 from Staples.com. I only dinged it a little for the weaknesses since I am not utilizing any of those features. I turned the brightness down & the contrast up. So having a lower brightness than a lot of the more expensive ones didn't really matter for me. I watched a movie & played a game on it with no ghosting.My next purchase is a tuner card, so I can remove the 25"" TV from my room. Not only did I free up some desk space, but I will free up a corner of my room. Size does matter."
4,Excellent Value,"I bought this monitor for less than $280.00 and I am totally satisfied with it's quality and performance. I upgraded from a 19"" Viewsonic CRT monitor so this is my first LCD. I compared the V7 with other monitors costing much more and I couldn't justify paying the extra money."
2,disappointing product,The turtleskin Patrol gloves are not suitable for searches. The index finger has no protection on it and after wearing for approx 30 mins the leather started to wear thin very quickly. After contacting the company they were very supportive and amazing in resolving the issue. Excellent customer service so far.
2,WHAT is with the 5 star reviews?,"This book STUNK. This is the third Michelle Reid backlist order I've placed, and it's the third stinkeroo. That does it for me!Jittery, twittery & ""she thought tragically"" spineless-style heroine, who NO ONE suggests needs therapy despite suffering a double rape - hero with NO personality or background other than to be a big, strong, understanding warm blanket to save the heroine from herself...and all the heroine's psychological problems neatly resolved in the end by a successful sexual encounter or two or three with the hero...ugh! I wanted to stop reading this tripe, but Michelle Reid reluctantly kept me in the loop...but 2 stars only and that's for her skill in keeping me hooked, not for the story or the characters!!! Ugh!"
5,From a friend,"There is a definite dark summer mood to this entire book, broken only once by a brief reference to childhood memories of snow. Very angsty, very sexual, and very interesting word-play. Recommend also Augurpenumbra by Ichmael Yttt."
5,Ultimate Ears Super.fi 5 Pro is awesome!,"Ultimate Ears Super.fi 5 Pro produces excellent sound quality, transparent sound, very good bass, mid and treble. It's also very effective in suppressing external noise and you can wear it while walking on the side of the street, on the noisy train, subway and buses. It's also very comfortable, you can wear it for hours. I got it at around 30% discount off the list price at Amazon, it's definitely a very good value for money!My only concern is the size of the 'ear cup', I wish UE provides additional size (between the mid and biggest size) since the biggest is to big for my ears and the mid size is little bit too lose.For some customers who feel disappointed with the product, most likely because they didn't insert this inner earphone properly into their ears or got the wrong expecatations. This product got excellent reviews from many independent analysts and website. Visit [...]to see the review of this product as well."
1,Complete FAIL,"Absolutely avoid these at all costs. There is nothing more frustrating than paying 200+ bucks for a pair of headphones, only to have them not hold up over time.I have encountered the exact same thing as other reviewers - namely, the connection between the earpiece and the cable is shoddy and loses connection, causing complete loss of sound.I am a musician and was relying on these things for my sound mix in my ears. I find myself all to often having to wiggle the wire while playing live, hoping that somehow I will find that tiny spot where the connection seems to work.There aren't replacements readily available on UE's website. They should send all purchasers of these headphones 2-3 replacement cables.Sound quality, decent. Product quality, terrible. Avoid."
5,Excellent Earphones For The iPod,Just got these a few days ago and they are excellent. Very detailed and flat response. Some reviews from other sources have said these are weak in highs. That is not the case. The high end is very flat and detailed without sounding tinny. Efficiency of these phones is very high and they can be driven quite loud by the regular iPod or the new iPod nano. One thing you must watch out for when you get these phones. You MUST carefully fit them with the included adapters to your ear. If they are not inserted far enough into the ear the sound will be crappy.
4,Nice but offer almost no bass.....,"They work really well but offer very little bass. I am no bass junkie, I listen to rock usually, but I was pretty disappointed after reading a few reviews on these headphones regarding the bass that they supposedly offered. Dont get me wrong they are really comfortable and come with lots of ear fitting to ensure a great fit. The cable is nice and thick and jogging in them is great. I should have bought the new Bose because the sound is a bit more three dimensional...."
3,"Great sound, annoying wires","Pros:* Excellent sound (close to as good as my Sony MDR-V6s* Comfortable silicon buds* Blocks a lot of ambient noiseCons:* REALLY annoyingly stiff wires. I'll have to play with the wires so they don't rub up against my face. I'd strongly recommend to Ultimate Ears that they use more supple wire casing next time; this alone will cause me to avoid this line of product* Maybe a little too bass heavy, doesn't sound as transparent as I'd like"
2,"Decent sound quality, but other factors bring it down","The sound quality of these earphones are good, but not at the level I expected for the price ($200). If that was the only issue, I would recommend these SuperFi 5 Pro earphones. But the deal killer here is the cord. To allow the user to shape the cord over the top and behind the ear, there is a flexible wire in the cord. It's a good idea, but poorly executed. I've had to replace the cord twice in 18 months (they run $20 plus tax/shipping). If you plan on using the small aluminum carrying case to carry it around while traveling, those wires will be bending all the time. And don't look for any sympathy from Ultimate Ears (now Logitech) if they break right after the end of the one year warranty. If you buy these earphones, plan on spending money on periodic cord replacement.For these reasons I can't recommend this product."
4,Best Sound for size and price,"Amazing inner ear headphones deliver clean dynamic sound.Capable of tons of detail and dynamics while remaining silky smooth.Beautiful full midrange response, only critisism is a slight amountof extra bass response. I'm using an older model IPOD so a newermodel may solve this."
1,Uncomfortable and broke after only 14 months,"Purchased May 2008 and used approximately 3x / week for 1 hour or less. Always uncomfortable as the only way to get them to stay on was to loop the stiff wire over ears. Surprisingly, the stiff, heavy, bulky wires failed at the Y connection after only 14 months of occasional use. Don't waste your money on these overpriced earphones."
4,I love these things!!,I really love these headphones. I have had them for quite a long time with no quality issues whatsoever. Does anyone know if you can purchase replacement double flange tips that come with the earphones originally? I have been unable to find those...
4,Classic chills,"I discovered the Hitchcock young readers' series of anthologies when I was a kid, and I still enjoy them! The contents for this one are:1. The Triumph of Death, by H. Russell Wakefield2. The Strange Valley, by T.V. Olsen3. The Christmas Spirit, by Dorothy B. Bennett4. The Bronze Door, by Raymond Chandler5. Slip Stream, by Sheila Hodgson6. The Quest for ""Blank Claveringi,"" by Patricia Highsmith7. Mis Pinkerton's Apocalypse, by Muriel Spark8. The Reunion After Three Hundred Years, by Alexis Tolstoy9. The Attic Express, by Alex Hamilton10. The Pram, by A.W. Bennett11. Mr. Ash's Studio, by H. Russell Wakefield"
5,Title.,"This is a pretty fancy tool. Everything works as described. My complaints:Overall: The tool is larger than most that I've used, and that makes the screwdrivers somewhat awkward.The 1/4"" drive: The adapter, also sold by SOG, and the 1/4"" hex bits I have from leatherman, while they fit and they drive, the bit does not lock into the socket adapter. These are, however, double-ended bits, and if I had a portable set of proper hex bits it would probably work fine.The screwdrivers: Like most, too much torque will make it feel like the knife is going to break. It has not actually broken, however.The mechanism: When you close the knife, it also pushes on the tool adjacent to it, one of the screwdrivers. This can cause that tool to close 'too far', preventing the locking mechanism from operating."
5,SOG is great,"This multi tool is high quality and is very handy in it's belt holder. The knife is SOG sharp, so be careful."
2,SOG S62,"This is a poor excuse for a multitool. While the compound gears are impressive at opening and closing the main pliers, the so called power lock mechanism is terrible. You have to line each tool up perfectly in order to lock each component. When you swing out a blade or driver, multiple tools swing out with it, necessitating pushing them back in. Then you need to align them perfectly for the tool you wanted to lock in place. Even if you think its locked, it tends to come loose, putting you at injury risk.I had always wanted a sog, but i'm going to have to return this(not bought on amazon, clearance at a sporting goods store, but even for $50 its not worth it.) This one also had no V-cutter, and had a second serrated knife. Maybe its defective or maybe not, but there are much better multitool options out there.Leatherman, and Victorinox have far supperior locking mechanisms. The Wave and Swisstools blow this out of the water."
4,A brilliant & fresh approach,"Really enjoyed this release. She can burn like Melissa at times, fall back on senstive sounds like Kathleen Edwards when she wants. There are influences from 60s rock (Elton, Beatles, Mott), yet her distinct warble blossoms as a wildwood flower. I'm gonna find her debut CD.If you gravitate toward other female singer-songwriter greats in league with Sarah Harmer, Alice Peacock or Jessica Sykes, this should work for you.Indigo Girls guest on ""Cannonball""As far as great CDs of the last couple of years go, this one ranks right up there with Allison Moorer's Neil Young inspired ""The Duel"" (hey if the Crazy Horse-shoe fits, wear it) and Patty Griffin's homage to the good ol' days,""Impossible Dream"". Lofty company to be sure."
2,Huge letdown,"I love her voice, but the songs here are nowhere near as good as the ones on the first album. For the most part everything's pretty stock and boring. A big disappointment."
2,Fabulous voice but another ANGST singer. Why? Why? Why?,"This cd is particularly disheartening. What we have here is the most beautiful voice to come along in years, but why all the gloom and depression? What we don't need is another ""angst"" singer. There are tons of 'em out there. I can't help thinking that this girl is wasting her talent. Looking for some uplifting, catchy and fun songs? You won't find any here."
5,"fall in love with ""the story""","Well, many thanks to the GM Olympic ad which has led me and many people to ""discover"" Brandi Carlile. ""The story"" is a great album and the title song, ""the story"" is still my favorite. Her voice has excellent resonance, very captivating."
2,Very Messy,This product is very oily. It's the most oily tanning product I've ever used. The product's oily feel doesn't go away until you shower. I haven't noticed any remarkable change in the color of my skin. It's very smelly as well.
3,stringfellow,"Decent stuff, comparable to fast-fret, not quite what I wanted though. I was hoping for a cleaner without the lubricant. Lube will protect your strings from corrosion if the instrument sits without being played for a while, the trade off is that it dulls the tone."
1,Not What I Expected,"I spent about five minutes skipping through this entire video. It was nothing like what I expected, and I could not get interested in it at all. I thought maybe there would be more to it than a bunch of individuals sitting in a circle in a big room, and some of the individuals speaking."
5,A must-buy!,"This is a must-buy for admirers of the great Italian tenor Giuseppe Giacomini. Although near 60 at the time of this recording, this unique voice is still as strong and vibrant as ever, and the tenor is presented in his most famous roles, including Otello and Andrea Chenier. The Otello selections may well be the greatest interpretations of this role ever recorded. Grab this one!"
3,Fine fixture but inadequate packing,It did arrived with the packing town and one corner of the fixture a bit bent. I was able to straighten the metal so not that big a deal plus I put it in my walk in closet so I didn't really care.
4,Another architectural work on SOA,"There are a variety of architectural works out on SOA. This is another architectural book in this crowded field. There is reasonably in-depth coverage of the role of each of the web services standards. Though I find the tone of this particular book a bit more accessible than the others. The author is plain spoken and pragmatic.There is some code in the book, in C# and C++. Though this is certainly not the focus of the book. Which is a straightforward walkthrough from web service standard basics, through integration, security and into transactions. It's a fairly short book, with each chapter at around 30-40 pages and the whole book weighing in at 400 pages.You will most likely have to buy other books and check other web resources to get in-depth coverage for your language of choice after taking the tour that is this book."
1,Not for MAC,"This ""port Replicator"" or ""glorified hub usb"" doesn't work with Lion OS, works good with Snow Leopard .... Kensington Support tells me, they will not work for a Lion Driver...take care.!"
2,West Texas reality check needed,"One of the great Texas singer/songwriters of the 1970s and 80s smokes some of The Dixie Chicks loco weed and sullies his musical legacy with some truly half-baked ""protest"" songs. Dylan was smart enough to finally distance himself from his early political songs and their humorless fans. I've met Butch and Dylan too and they were both pretty sharp operators, so I'll attribute this career misstep to ""too much time spent in Austin without a reality check"". Butch, head back to Lubbock some weekend and find out what real Texans are worried about these days. It sure ain't a won war, Hoss."
4,Good read,"Almost daily there is more information released about the Sphinx. For a time it was believed that the Sphinx was built about 10,000BC, now there is some who believe it was built 23000 BC."
1,Pure nonsense,"Once again Von Daniken ignores science and comes up with his own fantasy version of the truth. Von Daniken seems to have a grudge against archaeologists, who he repreatedly tries to bash. Unfortunately Von Daniken is the one who ends up looking like a fool. On Von Daniken's behalf, I will say this much for him- even though he has no proof, no validity, and no scientific background, he does seem to have his finger firmly on the pulse of the lunatic fringe."
3,Conscice with Good Pictures,"Although this book has extremely good photos and charts, its actual content is limited. Coverage of specific events and battles is conscice. This shortcoming is slightly made up for in the book's appendicies which include a nice atlas, portfolio projects, histrical documents, and glossary. However, I recomend this book only for a general review of world history. It is useful as a suplement to other world history texts."
2,Designer Let Down - Less Talking More Changing Rooms,"This DVD was more of a commentary by select designers of the UK series than a encore of favorite episodes. Quite honestly the designers of the show aren't the draw. It is the wacky, drastic, and sometimes disasterous exchange of change that occurs between two consenting neighbors. The draw of the show is the concept of someone giving up a room in their home, reluctant but oddly excited at the same time, in order for a neighbor and ""some pal"" they've chosen to come in and totally redesign it. This DVD however, is more of a tribute to the designers themselves. We see some bloopers, select designer interviews, favorite moments, and basically none of the good stuff that really attracts viewers to the show. Don't bother adding this one to your library. Stick to watching episodes on BBC!"
2,TOO GIMMICKY,"Duke's creativity was too much for Blue Note to handle,so he did a couple for Atlantic at the same time but this one is off the mark for me. There is at least one out of tempo tune,some soprano sax playing and Duke plays celeste on one tune. Duke's other Atlantic misadventure HONEY BUNS is not worth waiting for, if indeed they ever do re-issue it again. It's too light touched on already low sound quality."
2,hate it,I really hate this stereo. all the extras are just too bothersome for a car stereo. I like to listen to my ipod most of the time and I agree that it is very time consuming to scroll through the alphabet looking for a song. Changing the clock? Forget this one.
3,some good history,"This was a very good film, I think it offers a good look at life during the time Tito was the president of Yugoslavia. There are some very humorous parts of this movie."
2,Software is buggy,"The book is great for tips and tricks. However, if you wish to use the practice CD -- this is not the one to buy. I found many many bugs in the program. I was not even able to score a test after spending 45 min taking it -- the program simply failed out on the last few questions, and I had no idea how I did! Furthermore, the program gave me the same reading comprehension section 3 times during the same test. Finally, many of the questions from the test come from the practice sections in the book. Thus, if you want to see diffent questions -- don't waste your money on this book."
2,Caved in,"Fans of hardcore may appreciate the slightly-more-than-generic onslaught of pummeling power chords and poser vocals, everyone else should be thankful they evolved."
3,"OK. A little big for Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX150, and storage pocket a bit too small for just about anything.","But not very expensive case. It kept the sand out. I needed to store extra batteries, and the outside pocket was barely possible for one, but difficult to put in and take out. So I put the batteries inside, but I am worried about scratching the LCD.Will be looking for another."
4,Nice,"Nice bag, gives decent protection. A bit shorter then expected but with technology on the rise all our products are shrinking."
1,Too big for W series!,Someone wrote a review saying that cybershot cameras would fit very snug in this carrying case so I went ahead a bought one. Well it couldn't be further from the truth... I can fit two cybershot W series cameras inside this case. I probably won't return it because it's a hassle but I definitely don't recommend this case because it's way too big.
4,Served its purpose,"The case fitted the camera well, wasn't sure what the side net pocket was for but I am sure i will find something to fill it!"
4,sony case,This case is form fitting to the camera I also purchased and has a spare pocket to carry extra memory chips. Well designed product and again the price was right - I'd highly recommend
1,Not worth the money,"It did not fit the camera I purchased it for.....Canon PowerShot SX150 IS 14.1 MP Digital, although it was one of the recommended accessory . Its really small and looks too cheap. Does not provide any protection for the camera."
3,"Works as a camera case, but...","I purchased this case to protect my new Sony Cybershot W150. It's a compact designed case and the camera fits nicely inside. However, the smaller compartment does not comfortably hold accessories, namely the battery case for the camera (it fits in the compartment but appears to stretch the case slightly). On top of that, this camera case does not come with a shoulder strap or clips to attach a shoulder strap; it's meant to be placed on your belt. It's good for protecting a compact cybershot camera, but if you prefer a case with a shoulder strap you'd be better off looking at a different case."
5,Immortal Pavarotti,Voice of Angels................I want to collect every song this great man ever sang. His death was a loss to the world that can not be expressed in words.
1,This Sucked,They Aint Even Hav The Item In Stock So It Was A waste Of Time. I bought it three weeks before school started and the day before class they tell me its out of stock and they are giving me a refund three weeks later.
3,Begins well but Ends badly...,"Certain parts of the book are very interesting and enlightening, but most of it is a semi-rant which does not go anywhere and neither does it provide enough info for the reader to come to his/her own conclusion.The author re-iterates that germ-lime manipulation will take place sooner rather than later and most probably before we fully realize the implications. The book covers a lot of space with passages on new discoveries and achievements as well as political and religious undercurrents.Not a buy rating but I recommend you borrow and read this from your local library."
2,"Good topic, poor book","This book could have been written in 1/3 the pages. It continously poses the same argument for the same reasons over and over. Yes, that is good for emphasis, but unfortunately it does so in a few places ineffectively. There are numerous logical errors throughout the book (3 in the first 15 pages) and a couple of poor editing points making this book painful to read at points. I give this book its second star only for the great topic it attempts to talk about."
5,"Scary, insightful and well written by someone who knows","Greg Stock, is an excellent writer. This is quite a departure from his Book of Questions. Greg knows all the players in the legitimate life extension game. He heads a Biomedical company and was on faculty of UCLA Med SChool. He knows what he's talking about when he says we will have germinal choice technology soon that will allow parents to customize their children. It's not just the amazing ideas that are here, but the way Greg discusses the impact of such technologies on every aspect of our children's future. It's both an exciting and terrifying vision. Everyone should read this book-P-"
4,"Convincing, to a point","Gregory Stock writes well, and Redesigning Humans is an enjoyable read. Beyond that, nothing he puts foward is beyond the realm of reasonable possibility. Just the same, read with a bit of skepticism. He's a bit too much of a futurist, and while that's obviously the intention and draw of the book, I think it's much more worthwhile contrasted with something like Flesh and Machines: How Robots Will Change Us by Rodney Brooks"
5,THIS MOVIE ROCKS THE HOUSE ! BUY IT FROM AMAZON.COM,CAPTIN GEYU IS FUNNY i LIKED THE MOVIE BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF ACTIO
3,"Ok, but not the best","I got this version of the Goetia before the Henson edition was released. At the time this was the best version out there that I could find. I now have the Henson book and find it MUCH more useful. The Mathers version is not the complete Lemegeton and it also has some pretty heavy alterations done to it. This version does provide some interesting historical information, however, which is not available in other editions."
3,"Does its job, and free shipping on Amazon Prime","I bought this salt because it's the cheapest one available through Amazon Prime and i wanted all my nasal irrigation items to arrive together. It does the job, and is a fine substitute until my 3 pound bag of pickling salt arrives by standard mail (and at half the price of this 10 oz jar)."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed, I ordered the jars but received 2 bags which didn't work for me as I needed the 1 jar for storage and 1 jar to ship to a friend. If I new it came in bags I would not have ordered it, or at the least I should have been notified that it did not come in jars as advertised."
2,save your money,"My pharmacist tells me this is nothing but table salt. I'm sure this doesn't cake as much as table salt. But when my jar was empty, I replaced it with table salt and I see no difference."
2,Himalayan Institute Neti Pot Salt,"I'm giving this product 2 stars because the product was completely sealed, but upon opening I found the salt completely caked into one huge lump. I had to use an ice pick to break it up enough just to get the included scoop out of the salt. Now that the salt is completely broken down it is fine, I was just surprised to find it clumped up."
2,Very Disappointing,"I'd placed this on my Wish List prior to the reviewer's entry that called it 'flat', and I ordered it without rechecking the reviews. Now I'm sorry I did.It's almost as if the cuts have somehow been over processed, with most of the dynamic range removed. You don't get a feeling for the wonderful reach of Cass' voice. She just comes across as bland and tinny. After the first half-dozen songs, my wife looked at me and said, ""What's wrong with the CD? That doesn't sound like Cass the way I remember her.""There were also significant differences in the volume level between some of the tracks. We needed to crank it up to hear some tracks, and then turn it back down for the next one.Another indication of how cheaply this CD was produced is that there are no liner notes, just an addvertisement for MCA Record's other products. The liner says, ""Compact Disc, Compact Price"" - to which I'd add, don't purchase this unless you have ""Compact Expectations."""
4,She Was Unique,"This is a collection of Mama's Cass' 'Big Ones' (which weren't that many as a solo artist). Albeit with today's technology, it could have been recorded a little better."
5,Mama Cass,"I never had the opportunity to watch Lost when it originally aired on network tv. I started watching it on Netflix. When this song came on during beginning of second season, I think to myself ""I haven't heard that song in a long time, and it's a great song"" Had to buy the CD"
2,Poor organization ruins this book's potential,"This book is perhaps one of the most poorly structured programming references I've ever come across.It appears that the author, rather developing a logical organization for his material, dumped the summary of his years of experience into his word processor and cranked out the book. The content jumps wildly, referencing topics which haven't even been mentioned, much less discussed. And trying to locate those references will have you ripping out the index pages in sheer frustration.The CD isn't much better, suffering from the same ""brain dump"" approach as the book. It appears to contain every itty-bitty piece of code that crossed the author's mind during production. The files clutter your hard drive and make searching difficult.The book earned its two-star rating based mostly on the fact that its the only game in town. Its this book or the manuals. For the cover price of $65.00, the manuals are inviting."
1,DO NOT BUY IF YOU PLAN TO GET CERTIFIED!,I just wasted $150 on the exam. The test contains many questions about Application Intelligence and SmartDefense. Two topics that not covered in this book. I should have read these reviews before buying.
3,Does NOT Snap On to any bucket but Reliance's,"I bought this from Cabella's at the store. They sell the seats and buckets that go with them and also, the seats separately. I wanted a shorter bucket than the 5 gallon that is sold with it so I could tuck it under the bed at my cabin. So I bought only the seat because they say, and other retailers say the same thing, that it will snap on to any bucket. I could not find any bucket it would snap on. I was wondering why, then I noticed Reliance, who makes them, is in Canada so thought it was a metric issue. When I emailed them, they said it was designed to fit their bucket and couldn't guarantee it would snap on any other. Person I emailed was Heather Wilkes <wilkesh@relianceproducts.mb.ca> She never got back to me when I asked her why retailers are selling the seats separately and saying they will snap on any bucket. Cause they won't. I don't like the idea I could knock it off in the dark."
4,What can you say about a toilet seat?,"Just a little on the short, front to back, side.I would not recommend this item for ""big boned"" people. But for normal sized people it does its job."
4,From Credit Repair to Credit Millionaire,I use this book as a tool for teaching my tax clients about what their credit means. It is an easy to use reference for them to better understand the credit system. Donna lets the reader know what the lender is looking for when they ask questions. This is very important information for any borrower on how to answer the questions!
2,Where's the mystery,"I read this book expecting a mystery and wound up with a slew of Tennessee backwoods tales. None of the characters were that interesting and all were the product of things happening previously in their life. While a fast read, there was no depth. The mystery part of the book could have been written in less than 100 pages. There is too much of clutter of words that do not help the plot or the book. I hope the other books she's written are better, though I don't plan to find out."
2,A cookie cutter mystery novel,"This novel actually represents two books for me: the first Sharyn McCrumb novel I've ever read, and the last. As a lifelong resident of East Tennessee, I bought the book out of a newfound interest in regional fiction. But I was very disappointed to find that the author instead seems to have simply pasted local place names onto cookie-cutter ""mountain situations."" Also, I'm not very familiar with the mystery genre, but it's probably not a good sign that I had figured out the latter half of the entire storyline when I was barely halfway through with the book. The book is probably fine for die-hard mystery fans, but don't stumble in looking for great regional literature or an artful rendering of local color. And disregard any comparisons between the work of McCrumb and that of Charles Frazier (author of Cold Mountain). They're simply not on the same level of expertise."
3,Not exactly a page turner,"I generally enjoy Sharyn McCrumb's novel and while I did finish this book, it was not one of my favorites nor was it one I will be reading again. The dual plots of the murder/suicide of the Underhill family and the industial polluting of the Little Dove river were both interesting but I did not feel that either was completely explored nor were either brought to a satisfactory ending for me. There were many elements of the story that were left hanging and never explained. I like novels to end with the pieces all tied up or at least a plausible assumption as to why events happened and with this book, I was left feeling as if I had missed the last few chapters."
4,Black ash vinyl,"I built a pair of speakers that measured 20x46x15 using maple plywood. I had was going to stain them when I came across the Dayton Vinyl laminate, the price was right and my finished speakers had some flaws in the plywood so I thought why not give it a shot! The product looks good once it's on the plywood, getting it on with out bubbles or folds is another issue, but with slow half moon approach it can be done. And the finished speakers look great, they sound even better, but look great."
5,punk rock apocalypse,"I think some people really missed the point of this novel, just like catcher in the rye, it doesn't have a clear cut story...the motivations of the characters aren't simple or laid bare for you to knod along with, you have to dig here and that's what makes it great. Sam is a very realistic young gay man, he is obsessive, perhaps a little psychotic but so desperate for love that he projects all his emotions and feelings onto Clay, a surfer who is in denial about his bisexuality. the rollercoaster, surreal logic of the novel, the way we are taken to wild party and next emotional apocalypse perfectly defines the chaos of youth, that's what makes this novel great. this is real romance in the 21st Century, it's violent, chaotic, maddening and totally wicked sexy."
1,Bad,"Jerry Fuller seems to be a well respected person in the bass world (at least as he is portrayed in the magazine of the international society of bassists), so how shall I say it discreetly? this recording is really horrible.The music presented here is just ridiculous. very very very bad, and not worth the price of the CD. As for the level of playing on this recording, if one keeps in mind the horrible rap bass players usually got 100-200 years ago for playing out of tune and having an ugly sound, one can say that Mr. Fuller's was a ""historically-aware"" performance, if you know what I mean.In four words: Don't buy it. :-)"
5,Enjoyable for all generations,"An evening stroll engenders an unexpected friendship between an elderly woman, and a young girl. The elderly lady (Miz Berlin) recounts her childhood through beautifully creative stories which capture the imagination of the young girl and further ignites her curiosity about her elderly friend. The book's soft and poignant illustrations reveal the innocent spirit of the young girl's imaginings and gently draws the reader into the fantasy.I think adults and children - young girls especially - will enjoy reading Miz Berlin Walks. It is a tender, touching story that should be shared amongst all generations."
3,Seriously flawed - for beginners only,"I have found using this dictionary extremely frustating, primarily because it is really difficult to find words in the Farsi to English section. The words are sorted in a way (I'm not entirely sure by which criteria) that make finding words difficult if you only know ""Finglish"". Also, the Farsi script is so small that I would go cross-eyed whenever I used the book for more than a minute or so.On the other hand, the English to Farsi section is at least sorted alphabetically and I found it useful when I wanted a quick look-up of basic words. Apart from this and its compact size, there isn't much to recommend about this dictionary."
3,Not a bad effort,"I like the way it is laid out and the use of phonetic spelling for Farsi speakers but I found that it was missing some words, such as 'khojaste' and 'baad' (not wind)."
4,Tasty!,This guy does not stop! He's assembled a great band - and picks the right tunes to make a hot album! BUY THIS!
3,Paula Abdul is soooooo ANNOYING!,"PAULA Abdul ruins the whole video, this woman is absolutely repulsive, from the snotty attitude to the crappy coordination. this video is for little kids, so it boggles me why they didn't include dance moves for little kids, she makes it very hard for a little kid to follow, heck even i couldn't understand her moves. they should have had her do something simple that a kid under 5 can follow.Zoe is a cutie, but it's hard to bare to watch this while P. Abdul pierces through your scull with her annoying voice and attitude."
3,Better for older kids,"My daughter is a year old, loves Sesame Street. I bought this thinking it would be more of Elmo and Zoe but it was not. This is geared to kids starting at maybe 4, kids who are in dance class. Elmo has a very short roll in this and Zoe is only in it about half the time. The other half is showing different dance styles and where and how they originated. Not something a little one is too interested in."
1,Not a toddler type movie,My 2 year old daughter loves Sesame Street but this movie shows very little of Sesame Street Charecters. Zoe and Paula dance a little then it shows other dance segments. I purchased this video because I thought it would be a Sesame Street video with Zoe in it. Instead it is just a dance video. We also have Get up and Dance with Big Bird which my daughter watches everyday because there is a character in the majority of the movie. I sure wish that you could return viewed movies because I would much rather get a different video that my daughter would actually enjoy.
3,Entertaining- not Instructional,"Mixed feelings here. My granddaughter, aged 3, loved it, especially the muppets, the African section, Zoe's crazy dancing section, all of the ethnic dancing. We had to scurry around for all the props that the video kids were using. She watched it over and over trying to copy everything. However, most of her time was spent standing around glued to the screen. This is look at me, copy me pseudo dance instruction. However, some of the moves are downright dangerous for young children to try and copy. Changements, are you kidding me? (not even for 8 year olds from a video) Not unless you want severe knee and ankle problems. ""Copy me"" instruction has severe limitations. For young children problem solving emphasizing shapes, levels, directions, rhythm, and energy qualities lay a more substantial educational groundwork for dance appreciation. And creative dance problem solving is infinitely better suited to the charms of the Muppets!"
5,Full sunshine required,"I have to admit, this ""Rainbow Maker"" doesn't look that impressive when you see the item. But wait......hang it in any window that receives full sunshine and you will be pleasantly surprised how wonderful it really is! The rays of color are unbelievable and simply beautiful. I got one for each of my grand-kid's homes and they enjoy seeing the ""fairies"" and know they are coming from Meem with love. Just remember, it takes sunshine to make it wonderful!"
4,Not Too Bad,"As a weekend warrior and avid outdoor individual I neede an all around knife. Not to small, not to big. This knife takes care of that. It has a great blade, is easy to open, and easy to sharpen. The major drawback is the aesthitics, it could be a little more polished, and a little smoother in design."
2,Strange movie,"First off-I'm a big fan of Asian movies and the horror movies are typically well done-but this movie left me wondering what I'd just watched when it was finished. A psycho has decided that women want to be pretty like flowers-so he conceives a way of turning them into human flower pots-the remainder of the story is so convoluted--I'm not sure what it was about!As much as I like Asian horor movies--I'd recommend staying away from this one. Recent releases like ""Koma"" and ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" are much better movies than this oddity!"
4,What a Trip!,"This is a great video for those of us who remember and love the late '60's. Where else can we see that fab mini-skirted gal NANCY SINATRA belting out her number one smash hit, ""THESE BOOTS ARE MADE FOR WALKIN'""? Hard to find indeed! A MUST for all record and video collectors of this era. Are ya ready Boots?"
3,Not what I expected.,I had wanted a story in Spanish so my baby could listen to spoken Spanish. Instead I got Spanish and English woven together. That will not help her key in on the sounds of Spanish. Maybe it will be good later when she already has a good grasp of English.
5,A must have for every child,Ms. Bonet has given us an incredible gift. Her animated style of storytelling infects you with excitement. My kids and I listen to the tape often when we are traveling around town. She is the best that we have heard and we just want more!
5,celtic thunder = heritage,"I made a mistake ordering this . I got the dvd first by mistake when clicking on the item it dropped downto the dvd instead of the cd. We really enjoy it and we have several other cd's from celtic thunder andwe have seen them live in wallingford, ct. heritage by celtic thunder"
1,IHeritage by Celtic Thunder,"When I recieved "":Heritage"", by Celtic Thunder from Amazon It did not play' I had ordered two other Celtic Thunder cd's at the same time and there was no problem with them, I ordered another ,it did not play; I odered one more' that did not play, so I have given up.I am a big Celtic Thunder fan and hope to one day find a ""Hertitage"" that will work."
5,Mom loved it,Got this as a gift for my Momonly problem with itIs she wants MOREsigh - guess I have to be on the look out for another one - hehe
5,Celtic Thunder Heritaage,"For those who are Irish or want to be, this is a great show. I buy each new Celtic Thunder because I enjoy the music and enjoy watching Damian, the youngest, grow up."
3,"Well priced, but ........","This spatula looks good and is well made. My complaint is for outdoor grilling the handle is too short, and there is no beveled edge across the ""front"" edge to make it easier to release the fish from the grate."
4,ssab songs,"wow... dark, atmospheric. it's pretty creepy in a very backwoods sort of way. the way i've been describing it is ""somewhere between 'revolution 9' and 'deliverance'"". the only problem it has, and it is a big one, is that it is only a half an hour long! maybe they thought people might not be able to take anymore. i would have taken a lot more."
2,suelta las riendas de este CD!,"este disco es fenomenal! mikel es nuevamente un genio poeta en este disco, lleno de buena dosis de guitarras rockeras y hasta con tendencias punk ya q los musicos q grabaron con el este disco son ingleses, tendra qe ver algo?, bueno la verdad es q es que este disco es una belleza en su totalidad, tiene piezas muy rockeras y piezas acusticas llenas de mucho feeling, su voz genuina como siempre le mete su sello propio, y en esta ocasi√≥n interpreta Levanto el vuelo con Miguel Bos√©, excelente duo sin duda. Simplemente este disco debes comprarlo para saber a lo qe me refiero, cada vez q lo escucho canto todas las canciones sin parar! es un disco genial!"
2,water tank failed after 5 years,"I don't know how long you should expect a hot water dispenser to last, but this was the second one (both Insinkerators) to fail in 12 years. The first one came with the house. This model, the H990-2, failed after 5 years (manufactured in Nov-2004 and just sprung a leak Jan-2010). It was professionally installed. It worked fine while I had it. But the last few months, it was spitting out water inbetween uses. Apparently this is a sign that the tank is overheating. Today I noticed water under the sink, and the tank is leaking around the edges as well as along the power cord! So time to get a new one.After 2 failed insinkerators, I'm going to switch to a different brand."
1,great when it works but both of mine ended up leaking,"Unfortunately I did not notice when my H990-2 insinkerator instant hot water dispenser started leaking so I have damage to my kitchen cabinets. When we noticed some water under the sink I dryed the cabinet and placed some newspaper on the floor of the cabinet. It quickly became apparent the the hot water dispenser was the culprit. I spent some time searching for complaints and found quite a few customers having leak problems. I will be calling insinkerator tomorrow to complain, but I am beyond the warrantee period and don't expect much sympathy from Insinkerator based on what I have read from others experiences with Insinkerator customer service. I won't be replacing the dispenser with an insinkerator as I don't want to be monitoring the unit regularly. I guess it's back to the stove or microwave for tea and coffee."
1,Insinkerator Insta Hot H990-2 leaking,"I have had a model H990-2 for about 4.5 years. For the first 4 years, it worked great and no issues. We suddenly started to notice damaged cabinet and wetness. After a few careful days of observation, the guilty party was identified. You guessed it. My $280 unit was leaking water. I stopped the water line and remove the units in the hope of a possible repair. Guess what, the unit is sandwiched between layers of foam. Any attempts to remove it will break the foam and there goes your heat retaining capability. I guess repair is out of the question and I must replace the unit. I will NOT buy another Insinkerator Instahot unit. I am sorry I pick the most expensive unit to be faced with this. I am sure the manufacturer will not stand behind their trash and I must dish out more money to replace the unit. Do NOT BUY this product."
1,Leaky and noisy,"After 4-5 years of light use this unit started leaking, creating a big mess. I would stay away from anything made by this vendor."
1,Don't Buy,We had to replace after 8 years and had to get the same unit because of space. It's very cheaply built and rusted out and started leaking water. Unbelievable how cheap they make this product.We've had garbage disposals for 35 years and this is the only one that's rusted out.
5,Easy Install....great disposal,"Removed the old one and installed the new one in about 20 minutes. Easy installation, just followed the instructionsand it was a snap."
3,Badge the Badger,I bought this food waste disposer to replace an identical one because I knew it would fit my plumbing. I wanted to avoid the hastle of altering the plumbing to fit another brand. The Badger I replaced threw a cutter (it came out of the opening while the disposer was running) and also rotted out on the side at the top half. I'm hoping this one does better. The material at the top does not appear to be metal like the first one.
2,Dead in four years,"No complaints, it worked perfectly... but for only four years. Now the housing is cracked, and leaking. Time to find a new disposal. It won't be another Badger - four years is too short."
5,Eats all of my garbage,This was an exact replacement for the original that lasted more than 10 years. It only broke because too many spoons fell into the disposer over the years. It probably would have lasted twice as long.
4,badger 5,"This item arrived very quickly in nice packaging and was super easy to install. It works great, super quiet and was a nice low price."
4,InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP Food Waste Disposer,I installed the insinkerator and I am not a plumber... The biggest challange is to push the disposer up and turn and hold the top down inside the sink. I just had a neighbor hold it down for me. Alot better than paying a plumber $70.00 to do it. It has been installed over 2 months now with no issues. Works great!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Cracked and leaking,Do not buy. Light use but it has still developed 3 vertical cracks in the housing and leaks. I found many similar complaints online. Very disappointed in this product and will not buy another.
5,Best Money Can Buy,"After 20 years of hard use, replaced the old In-Sink-Erator disposer that still worked exceptionally well. This new one is even better. Installation was simple. Bones and vegetable waste disappear within seconds. For residential kitchen uses, there are no better disposers."
1,Many ctracked housings,"Bought a house, 5 weeks later the disposal started leaking from a crack in the housing. Yup, the Badger 5 1/2 HP that seems to crack all the time from what I read. I bought a new one from Home Depot and just for kicks looked up other prices and reviews. 30 dollars cheaper from Amazon but I read all the reviews and am bringing it back tomorrow. Will probably get a Waste King.Finally some reviews that were really helpful! I hope this helps others too....."
5,Precisely as advertised,"The order, shipment, and installation were precisely as advertised. It took me about an hour to install. Very satisfied with this purchase and experience."
2,Cracks and leaks,"Had a Badger 5 in the kitchen of a new home, now 5 years old. Worked fine. A bit loud. After 5 years, developed SEVERAL cracks that leaked just as many others have reported. It was very easy to replace with another InSinkErator disposal (InSinkErator 3/4 HP Evolution Compact Continuous Feed Disposer). Seems solid, very quiet. hard to know if the upgrade was worth it....they all just chew up your waste after all."
5,"Loud. So, you",know it is working. This is better than my broken Badger. It works better because the last one lasted for ten years and stopped working. This one is new so you know its going to work for another ten years.
1,Housing Broke,The housing broke on both of mine. House was built 3 years ago. I have 2 kitchen sinks and both aerators have broke at the housing. DO NOT buy this disposal!
1,No more badgers for us,"We bought our Badger 5 just over 2 yrs ago. This was a replacement for an earlier Badger that had developed a cracked housing and leaked. That one was over five years old, so we figured it was a good unit. The installation was easy swap out, but the quality is not the same. This unit just jams, and we free it up with the wrench. It does this every day. Just jams with no visible objects inside that would cause this. We have septic, and use a disposer very lightly for food particles. No bones, sand or heavy duty uses. They were not interested on hearing my argument since the warranty was up. I'm going elswhere."
1,ANOTHER cracked body,"I replaced my cracked body Badger 5 with a new one. The same thing happened, just outside of warranty, the body split open and caused water damage to my cabinets. This is getting rediculous, maybe we need to unite against this horrible product and company!"
2,Another Cracked Badger 5,"I installed this Badger 5 Disposer in a rental condo about 5 years ago. I now had to replace it because it developed a 4"" vertical crack in the upper enclosure (housing). The enclosures used to be made of metal (and eventually rust through), but I now discovered that they are made of cheap plastic. This one was manufactured in Oct. 2006. The value of my time - making 2 trips - was worth more than the cost of the disposer. A leak like this can also cause substantial damage to to the kitchen cabinet and floor. It is sad that the company cannot engineer a better product. From reading the reviews, it is obvious that this is a design defect, not the result of improper use. The other brand I use is Waste King, and I have not had any such problems with their disposers."
4,Disposable disposers,"Had a Kitchenaid disposer installed less than a year ago and it would jam constantly. Had to get the stick and try to free it and it would then work again, at least for awhile. Then it developed a metallic rattle and finally quit and would not respond to the stick treatment. Bought a InSinkErator Badger 5 as I was familiar with the brand and owned one years ago. This is much quieter than the KitchenAid and proably will last. And the KitchenAid is now made by Whirlpool, whose quality is slipping."
2,It broke right after the warranty was up.,"I had my house built, all new appliances, and expected things to last longer since I don't cook and am not in the kitchen much. WRONG! But, the biggest shocker is that the Badger disposal is broken. What? How? Why? I don't put much down there outside of toast and ... well, soft foods. No utensils. I don't have young people playing with the disposal. I just don't get it and am highly disappointed in this product.When you're looking for a disposal - stay away from Badger!"
5,Easy replacement,This product fit like a glove in replacing my 15 year old Badger 5. I just hope this one gets me that far.
4,"So far, so good","I wanted to replace my old disposer that began to leak and thought I'd get another Badger since that's what I had. Then, I read reviews about problems. However, I grew up with insinkerators, and have only had this brand of fairly basic disposers all of my life so I decided to give it another try so it could be easily installed in the existing mounting. Almost a month into using the new disposer, I am very happy with it and would definately purchase it again. My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that some disposers have more features than this one."
4,A good folder for hard work,"UPDATE:I first wrote this review a while back. My preference for the handle size/shape is obvious, but there are now some newer knives from other manufacturers available with good handles and better steel (such as a Spyderco Native 3D). I would rate this 3 stars now due to better options being available.ORIGINAL REVIEW:There aren't a lot of options for a folding knife with a handle that doesn't hurt your hand after a while. I have some more expensive knives with more expensive steel, but they are painfull to use for any length of time. This one is great. The handle is wide and shaped well. It is built for actual use and is put together well. Like other SOG knives, it's a tad on the expensive side, but you do get a good knife. SOG doesn't sell these by the millions at Wally-World, so you do pay more for it.This knife doesn't have a clip, and it isn't a slim knife that slides into your pocket. It comes with a belt puch. It is still very low weight thanks to the handle."
3,Mostly positive,Bought 2 as additions to existing system -- already knew handset quality was good (though a bit pricey). Problem was supplied batteries in both phones died after about 10 days and I had to buy replacements (couldn't wait for ATT to fiddle around supplying warranty replacements). Better not to supply batteries (and reduce cost) rather than provide junk.
3,AT&T E580-2 Accessory Handset,"Color screen is of very low resolution, and, therefore, appears cheap. Batteries do not stay charged for very long. Sound quality is marginal."
5,For the love of color,"Same as the E580-1 but in full color....and for a little more money. I added it to the system as one of the expandables and love it. If you are trying to save money, go with the 1 instead of this one."
5,ATT cordless phone E580-2,I had the base unit and 4 expansion units prior to purchasing the 5th expansion unit. I really like the features and the reliability of the phones over the many other brands and types I've tried in the past.
4,fun game involves lots of thinking,"king kong is an incredible game with great graphics and gameplay!I haven't beat it yet because the mission I'm on doesn't even make sence.you have to get fire so you can burn some bushes blocking the path.there is fire but it's behind a waterfall so if you try to take the fire back you can't because it will get burnt out.the anoying thing is the raptors,once you kill two a few minutes later two come after you agian.i like playing as kong.you can break the jaws of the beast your fighting.you can even hear it break!another thing that stinks is you run out of ammunition alot and have to use a spear most of the time.so trying to kill some pest is really hard!overal it's a great game i don't think it's worth $50.00 so wait until it goes down to $30.00.might want to rent it first to see how it is."
1,not even worth a rental.,"wow, this game is bad, and i mean BAD. the graphics are ""decent"" - the PC king kong graphics are far better. at first it seems like the game may be going somewhere, because the script seems pretty cool, but you quickly find out the shooting is very boring (if you want a good ps2 shooting game, try timesplitters: future perfect). nonetheless i was determined to give this game a fair shot...too bad it wouldn't let me. i kept going forward and got literally stuck by an invisible wall glitch. the woman said ""follow me!"" and so i did.. and i couldn't go any further through the invisible wall. oh no! my terribly subpar gaming experience was ruined by a BUG! oh well. king kong for the ps2 is a terrible game, with or without game-ruining bugs.the PC version is another story. it's a lot more involving and has far superior graphics."
5,An awsome video game,This video game is awsome some of it was Kinda hard it took me a couple of days to beat it but it was worth it.Heres some of the bad things in the game1 when you cant see as jack you can get killed very easy2 Hayes is so stupid.If you get enough points you get to unlock the alternative ending where kong survives and goes back to his home.
1,"Nice graphics, nice music but........","This game suffered the ""GEORGE LUCAS SYNDROME"".A lot of effects and no story at all.The typical 3D shooter, you just walk around and shoot lobsters and maggets and worms, and thats all.Very nice graphics and music, but your brains can be in the last stage of the alzheimer and you still can win the game.You dont even have to look for nothing, no trap doors or secret tunnels, just wait until the other characters tell you to move on.You stay in some scenes 2 or 3 minutes shooting worms and then a rock falls and you move on through that hole.I just hope the movie will be better than this."

5,Margarita time.,I was in Mexico the first time I heard this album and I HAD to have it. The voices blend together flawlessly. The musicians are highly skillful and authentic. Perfect Sunday afternoon Margarita music. :-)
3,Not comprehensive enough,"I am reviewing the 2010 edition. I found it to be lacking in specific terms that I was concerned with; for example, ""regime,"" as it applies to vegetative landscapes, which is the definition I was looking for when I decided to buy the dictionary. I work with environmental documents on a routine basis, and I am finding that glossaries specific to the documents (if they have one) are often better at defining concepts than a dictionary such as this. The dictionary might be great for a university student. And perhaps the later version is more comprehensive."
5,perfect,"Perfect,except I had to sew up one corner of the comforter. Oh well. It was worth it. Room looks perrrrrfect!"
4,Insightful!,"Joel P. Henning's diagnosis of the growing irrelevancy of business staff groups is right on the money. Simply put, staff members have for too long cozied up to management, ignoring the critical line units that they are supposed to serve. As a result, it's the staff gets laid off first when times get tough. Likewise, Henning's prescriptions for revamping staff groups into effective support units merit careful study. Although sections of this book are thin in substance, we from getAbstract recommend this insightful analysis of corporate structure to all business leaders."
4,Testing the Pop scene?,"Granted this album has some blatantly country songs (""American Made,"" ""Amity""), but it also is a sign of the Oaks testing the waters of the pop scene with some less country-sounding material. The first track, ""Love Song,"" features a full horn line, and ""Down The Hall"" could've easily snuck into the A/C charts. The only shame is that MCA was real big on MORE product (between 1981 and 1984, the Oaks released FIVE albums, only one of which contained previously-released material). This was one fo the albums, I think, that suffered from that sandwich, with the Oaks being unable to really give it the time it deserved."
1,Music For The Police State,"In between stumping for republican politicians like Jeb Bush the ORB make music designed to appeal to those very same Republican politicians. `American Made', get it? Be Afraid, be very afraid."
2,Okay,"I am not really a heavy metal fan, so this cd didn't please me at all. However, I did like some songs: 'What If' by Creed, 'Suffocate' by Finger Eleven, 'Automatic' by American Pearl, 'Crowded Elevator' by Incubus, and 'Dissention' by Orgy. The last song by Creed is cool, too. I could stand those tracks. 'Spiders' by System Of A Down was so annoying that it drove me crazy! The rest of the tracks did not cut it for me. 'Time Bomb' by Godsmack and 'So Real' by Static - x are the worst tracks on here(in my opinion.) Godsmack just screams and Static - x is so blah and boring. I can't say if I'd recommend this. It just depends what music you like."
4,Pleasing,"I really liked this cd. It has a lot of rock in it. So if your'e in the mood for rock this cd is it, it also features two songs from my faveorite group Creed. So I think everyone will enjoy it."
3,Okay for some people,"I am a major fan of the Scream franchise as well as the soundtracks that accompany it. However, I find this cd too hard to listen to. If you own the previous 2 (or 3) Scream cds and enjoy that type of music, I would reccomend thinking twice about buying this cd. While the music on the previous Scream cds was eclectic, this cd relies too heavily on hard rock. I was majorly disappointed because I wanted so much to like this cd when it came out. I give this cd 3 stars though because if you are a fan of this type of music, you will most likely find this cd excellent. For me however, the previous Scream cds far surpass this one. I am going to wait for the Scream 3 score cd to be released on February 29 by Varese Sarabande records. I feel that cd will fit more into the style of the past 3 Scream cds. To sum it up, this cd is perfect for those who like this kind of music, not necessarily those who like Scream."
3,lack of information,ihis. It comes up with things I don't even know about. in order for me tove any use of this item I mus type in the info on almost every item I want and this is only done by looking all the info in a carb and calorie bood.. Guess if I had the money I could have gotten e that had more inmation.
2,You get what you pay for!,"This product is ok for the price but has several features missing that I would have liked. The one I got doesn't track fiber or sodium. But the major problem I have with it is that you can't connect it to a computer to print out a weekly diet sheet. Also you can only add 100 foods that are not listed and they only include 800 foods, so I find that I'm adding ""raw egg"" instead of ""boiled egg"" because it is not listed and I don't want to waste my 100 entries on something that has the exact same calories. Also the closure on it is a little bit hard to open. I will probably use it until I get something better and then sell it to someone in my diet group (or on ebay)."
2,From Back Cover,"Cooking Up TroubleMark Cook shouldn't mind that a Hollywood heartthrob is intruding on his family's ranch to learn how to be a cowboy. Or that Mr. Moviestar is getting a bit too close to his best friend, Alyssa Halloway. But, damn it all, he's jealous to the point of distraction whenever he sees them together! And to compete with a gorgeous actor for Alyssa's heart, things are gonna get dirty down on the farm....Kiss the CookNo one has ever been able to hook heartbreaker Billy Cook like wild Kate Jenkins. Her passionate kisses made him fall in love thirteen years ago, only for her to turn around and break his teenage heart by leaving town. In fact, she's the reason he vowed to be a confirmed bachelor! Now pregnant, Kate is back in Montana to deliver her baby, claiming her wanderlust days are over. And Billy can't help wonder if his vow was a bit too hasty...."
4,Great book but needs to be updated,"This book is an excellant introduction to the field of Space Physics. Unfortunately, it has not been updated since its original publication. It would be nice to have the results of the extensive research that has been done since then incorporated into a new edition of this book. Even so, I have not come across any other books published since then that are nearly as good. When I bought my copy ten years ago, I would certainly have given it 5 stars."
1,I HAVE NOT HEARD THIS CD,SOMETHING YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THAT THE OTHER REVIEWERS DID NOT SEEM TO KNOW IS THIS IS NOT A RELEASE FROM MICHAEL'S RECORD LABEL...THESE ARE OLD RECORDINGS THAT ANOTHER LABEL THREW TOGETHER TO CASH IN ON HIS NEW FOUND POPULARITY...THAT IS WHY I HAVE NOT BOUGHT IT...THESE RELEASES ARE OFTEN NOT WHAT THE ARTIST WANTED TO COME OUT BUT HAVE NO WAY OF STOPPING IT AND STUPID PEOPLE BUY IT AND BLAME THE ARTIST FOR THE MONEY THEY WASTED...SO IF YOU PURCHASE IT KEEP THAT IN MIND...IF YOU LOVE MICHAEL IT WON'T MATTER...
3,it's all in his name,"They really shouldn't have named it Totally Buble. It should have been named 'the Totally Blond Soundtrack - because thats what this cd actually is. This IS the music from the movie (it was kinda cute) but I asked a friend who is 'in the know' about this cd and she says that while Buble did star and sing in the movie Totally Blonde, the movie owners are just trying to capitalize on the sizzling hot Buble name - therefore - Totally Buble and not a Totally Blonde soundtrack.....You can see what I mean. It's actually too bad because Buble IS a wonderful singer and movie itself was ok. They should have just sold this as a soundtrack and not made it sound like this was a Buble project - it definately was not!"
4,Great Vocalist,"This cd is great.....but way too short...I can listen to him all day and never tire of his wonderfully smooth voice. Since this cd is from the motion picture Totally Blonde, you can expect that it is not a regular cd and the price lets you in on the fact that it may not be full length. Even though it is short...16 minutes in length, I would suggest it for any one who loves this singer. Only four stars because it's only 16 minutes."
1,"listen to Buble, he says don't buy it.",Talked to a real big Buble fan and she said don't buy this cd because they are just trying to cash in on the Buble name and fame.She said this is an attempt to capitalize on the success of his 2 fantastic WarnerBrothers releases (Michael Buble and It's Time).I bought it just to hear it and wish I would have saved the money.Save yours........
1,Doesn't sound like the Buble I know,"There's no mistaking Buble's superlative voice, it's that the songs on this cd are just poorly written. Too bad.I read he didn't want this released and now I know why. Save yourself the money and buy his Come Fly With Me DVD instead - now that's him live and in the flesh and right on the money."
3,I've had three of these...,"Which probably tells you most of what you need to know. They're super-crazy-handy, but are very poorly made also. The first one sprung a small leak after about three years of use. After replacing, opened the old one up and found bad soldering and decaying plastics. The second one failed electrically after just a few weeks. Returned it to the store, and brought the third one home. That one has lasted about four years, and now the house is sold. Am thinking about installing a hot water dispenser in my new house, but have to find a better built model!"
1,Garbage,"During the 15 years I owned my home, I went through three of these. The first mistake was understandable, as I didn't know this is the ""disposable"" model offered by Insinkerator. The second mistake ... well, I should have known better, but I thought that I'd have to replace it with the identical model. You don't, as the hole in the countertop is standard for many hot water dispensers. But the third one? That was only because number two died while I was in the process of selling the house. So, I was not about to replace it with a high-end model at higher price ... the buyers were not nice people.But don't make my mistake. Avoid this, pay twice or three times as much for a different manufacturer's product, and save yourself grief and the plumber's labor costs, because you'll be replacing this piece of garbage in a few years."
1,Worse than Junk - a waste of time as well as money,"This abomination lasted about a month before it stopped heating the water. I previously had a different In-Sinkerator hot-water dispenser model that lasted about nine years, so I expected that same life-time out of this one. What a disappointment! I have come to the realization that In-Sinkerator just makes crappy products. I had switched from their inferior sink grinders to better quality products, so I should have known better. You live and learn."
2,Like the concept - not the product,"This was our first hot water dispenser, I say was because we now need another one after a little over 2 years. Hopefully our next one will be of better quality and a different brand.Yes - it's noisy but it's in the kitchen. It spurts occasionally as it releases pressure. The problem that we've had for a couple of months now is the sticking valve that won't shut off. We have to shut off the water supply until we can un-stick the valve. Now the plastic lever is cracked. So we're shopping for a replacement.We did without one before we purchased this one - but we are so ""addicted"" to having hot water on demand that not replacing it is not an option.I would not buy the ""hot-1"" after having this one and am looking for another brand other than in-sink-erator.If you are considering a hot water dispenser, I say get one without hesitation. But shop around for something better than this model."
2,Poor quality for a high price,"These sell upwards $180+ per copy. (Home Depot is 145+tax). For that kind of money it's a rip-off considering the few parts required, and the poor, flimsy quality with inappropriate choice of materials. (All seals of the hot water path should be silicone - they're NOT, they fail first.) They last (in my case) about 3-4 years (tops) but we're not heavy users. (Compare to that a Pfister kitchen sink faucet's quality for $150 or thereabouts; in that comparison InSinkErator HOT-1 is pure JUNK).I wish there was a rip-off copy from China, for half the price; InSinkErator people deserve to be copied and bankrupted. If I find an Asian copy, it's GONE."
2,Doesn't last,"We've had two Insinkerator units in the past 9 years and we now have to get a third. For some reason I never expected that these units would be a periodic replacement item. The failure mechanism has been the same both times, leaking under the sink and flooding the cabinet. It seems strange that so many people have a negative opinion about this unit and I've decided to give another brand a try. --From what I've read there are better units out there."
2,Do Not Buy!,"Here's my quick no-nonsense review:*Overall, seems cheaply made. I feel like the handle will break with little effort.*Hisses and spits out steam and hot water-- turning it to a lower heating level to fix this is silly!! What's the point in that Insinkerator?!I'd give it 1 star... but at least it is capable of heating water, so I guess that's worth an extra star.STAY AWAY FROM THUS JUNK!!"
3,OK Unit,"One of these units was installed in the home we purchased a couple of years ago. At first we wondered whether we would use the unit but have found it quite useful. We use it pretty much every day BUT....I always wondered how long the plastic lever would last...well...it finally broke a couple of days ago...I am trying to find a replacement lever right now....from reading other reviews online the plastic lever is the weak link in this unit.I do find the unit spits quite a bit...especially if I turn the water temperature up a bit. But it does fill the need...unfortunately, we've gotten used to having it and until I get the lever fixed we have to actually boil water on the stove...back to the dark ages.....:("
5,Nothing Ordinary about Ordinary World,"Most people will know Warren for his work with Duran Duran. It's a well known fact that he was responsible for writing Ordinary World, and on this album you will find Ordinary World in its true glory. The guitars and the rhythm section make it one of the most amazing pieces of music ever written. You're not a Duran Duran fan until you've heard this song the way it's meant to be played.Other great tracks include Suddenly Spring, which will baffle even the best guitar players, Willie the Pimp and Transylvanian Boogie, some of Warren's work from Zappa times and some of his more recent offerings. Buy and enjoy this record!"
3,Mirror gazing ball,Picture of item shows a small nipple at the bottom and upon receiving this item that was not the case. Would like that nipple to insert into the holder I had planned to use. Not sure if it will stay put.
4,Turning Point in the Lives of Sisters,"Maria and Rachel, the two eldest Hammond daughters take opposite attitudes regarding the family's hardships. One is embarrassed and deeply resentful, while the other is Pollyanna grown up. Their almost exaggerated responses play out in mostly predictable fashion in romance and life decisions. The men they meet are well-developed characters - there is no stinting in this moving story."
5,excellent series,"I am a big fan of the poirot series and this was a very very good purchase, with a decent price. :)"
1,not describe well,I received this necklace and it was barely long enough for a 3 yr old child. I could not even get it around my neck. I will use the beads for something else. disappointed
1,Won't run on Windows XP,"This is a terrible program. I installed it twice, and it gets error messages and won't run. I called the help phone number and I end up with a porn site. I want my money back."
4,Awesome and handy,"I bought PSE for enhancing my home photos. Its a very nice and handy product. I like and use the magic extractor feature the most. I should say, that is the primary feature for which I bought PSE. I've always liked PS and PaintShop Pro equally - but bought this at a juncture when PSE 5.0 was out there and the price for this previous version was low - also that there are not many features between v5 and v4 that I need."
3,No SVCD or DVD Support for Photo Silde?,"I am totally new to photo editing and Photoshop Elements 4. I bought it because I have a digital cameral,and want to learn how to do some photo editing. It has lots of features. My one disappointment so far is to make a photo slide -- you can only make photo slide to a cd in vcd, not svcd or dvd. I tried it and the video quality was awful. Who wants to watch vcd in today's dvd world? With all the dvd expertise Adobe has, somehow they neglect to incorporate dvd support for their newest Photoshop Elements 4. I hope they release a fix for this soon."
2,Where's the File Browser,"New selection and extraction tools are nice, but my copy of this release (4.0) will go in the trash. Without the File Browser window, I will continue to use Elements 3.0. Or maybe give Paint Shop Pro 10 a shot, especially if this is how Adobe treats loyal customers. Put in trivial new features, take out the best features and charge you $100 for the favor! No thank you!"
1,Nonexistent customer service--and hideous software,"Elements 4 screwed up my registry, repeatedly crashed two other programs (including the scanner utility), and ruined my night. I had to uninstall other programs *and* uninstall Elements 4. When I put my old Elements 3 on the computer, everything worked again (once I reinstalled it, bah!).Adobe has the most inaccessible customer service on earth, even when you're trying to provide a bug report. It amazes me that they don't go out of business, with such lousy customer service. You won't get any free help with this product, no matter what the problem. If you buy this, you'd better prepare to buy several books just to figure out the changes. Better yet, pick up Elements 2 or 3 and skip this entirely.It makes no sense why Adobe keeps changing the Elements interface. I thought nothing could be more annoying than the Elements 3 interface, but Adobe has outdone itself. I've bought every upgrade since Elements 1, and this is the last one for me."
2,Brushes falling apart,"Purchased these for granddaughter for Christmas. She finally got around to using them the 12feg2012. After one use and one washing they started falling apart. The 3 year old was well supervised while using them so no abuse was allowed while using them. She really enjoyed using them so I will have to go to a hobby shop to acquire more. I purchased paints, containers, erasers to complete an easel set so she will need new brushes. I suppose getting this many brushes for such a low price should have warned me. If its to go to be true, its probably not true."
5,Great brushs,Can be used for a wide variety of applications. There are enough different shapes to do any job which requires a brush
4,full of info,"If you want to learn all about Egypt, mummies, egyptian gods, and everyday life in Egypt this is the book for you. It's all here in The World of Pyramids! Full color photos help tp bring the inormation to life. Also included in the book are a glossary for terms and a very helful index for easy refrence.The only thing that we did not like about this book was that the pages seemed too busy. Too much information was packed on to the pages.We would recommed this book to kids ages 8 -12. It will help them to understand more about Ancient Egypt."
3,I have a question........,"What's with the hat?Having seen this ad infinitum at the Bose store, which thankfully is parked alongside Starbucks, I've enjoyed JLo dancing about and singing. But the hat? Who had the Kmart fashion moment in her camp?Just goes to show I'll never sort out pop culture...."
3,weight not distributed well,"Due to the design, you need to distribute the weight evenly. If you have something hanging on the back hook, you need something of equal weight hanging on the front hook so it stays balanced. This is a good solution for organizing your ties/belts for cheap, but not a great long term solution. I will eventually look for something that I can mount on my door, but for now this works good enough."
3,Basic simple,"This works exactly like you'd think it would. It holds multiple belts, although my husband's ties are a little awkward hanging there and they get a little wrinkled but not enough to remove them. Also, its made in China for those who like buying American made products."
4,"No Fluff, Just good Stuff","Lee departs from her previous pop rock style to give fans a bit of a different taste and what a taste it is! If songs like Whatcha do to my body or Some Girls do, don't do it for you, maybe this will. There's a little more sincerity or realness to this album as opposed to others. There's also way more of a cool groove to this. Odds of Love, Judgement Day and Waterfall being prime examples. Most of this album left me with my hair sticking up on my arms as I felt really taken away by it. I just kept going, ""this is cool."" It's too bad that this direction for Lee didn't really last. Of course, the new Lee was influnced by what the Seattle Scene was doing and any pre-Nirvana hard rock bands like Lee, had to quickly switch to a new sound to keep fans. Most bands didn't fare well with the new direction imposed on them, but this album was really good. Too bad it got lost. I urge you to re-discover."
5,This is what songwriting and music should be!!,A definitive work of Texas art!! Houston Marchman bares his soul and delivers music the way it was meant to be....elemental. Anyone who appreciates the craft of songwriting and musical arrangement will revel in this classic. It's definitely on my WHICH TEN CD'S WOULD I TAKE WITH ME TO A DESERTED ISLAND? list!! Music doesn't get any better than this.
4,works nicely,"This cargo organizer is soft, no hard supported inserted inside. It works and is a great product based on its price.Its size is not so big. I assume most of car's truck could contain it."
2,"Serves a purpose, barely","I always have an SUV full of brochures and promo items. This organizer is just not designed well because it has soft sides and everything droops and spills out all over. I also bought the Jokari organizer and although I do use them both at the same time, the Jokari has sturdy sides, so it doesn't lose it's shape and sag. If I had it to do over, I would have bought two Jokari totes."
1,This is organization?,"I'm tired of using this product. While the picture shows an expanded bag full of items, the actual product collapses on itself and has no real rectangular shape unless it's filled at maximum capacity. It's like building a tent without any sticks. I have a clothes hamper with the same material that is able to take an actual shape with it's use of zippers and small poles, i wish this product would be able to do the same."
2,Didn't like this so much,"The organizer is well made but unless it's filled with stuff, it'll collapse. I ended up getting a cargo net that's working better for me."
4,Great organizer,"This is a practical organizer that fits into most vehicles' truck. Mine is a Honda Accord and it's great to put tools, wires, bottles, and slippers there, any miscellaneous stuff works well."
3,Fine,it was fine sweet smelling leave your skin smooth and refreshed.i have no complaints i wud recommend it to individuals but it woud be better if it came in a pack
1,THIS DVD WILL BURN IMAGES ONTO YOUR TV SCREEN,"Any DVD that has stationary images such as this (BluScenes) product will eventually burn those images onto your TV screen. It is called (image retention) and once it happens it can NOT be reversed. The question here is not about price or picture quality (which is NOT hi-def) it is really about how much you value your high-def TV? So regardless of what this seller says go ahead and do your own research, plug this into your browser >> image retention high definition tv"
1,Junk,The thing cracked and rusted out after 2 years. This is complete junk. Their are complaints around the internet about these badger disposers cracking. DO NOT BUY.
2,missing parts,"bought this and during installation the whole thing came apart, upon inspection i noticed 2 or the 4 bolts that hold it together were missing. Luckily i still had the old one and just took 2 of the rusty ones out and put them in the new unit. Be advised INSiNKERATOR does NOT SEND OUT ANY REPLACEMENT PARTS!!!!! This is a terrible company for customer service. Offers to send out repair person but then says it will cost $99 since it was not a defect just missing parts??????? rediculous."
1,Useless when it leaks,had this for 4 years....supposed to last.....seal or something is leaking..and having to replace....don't bother with this brand...they obviously make there disposals disposable.won't be buying this brand again
4,Good value,"Just replaced a 20+ year old Badger 1 that had rusted out at the dishwasher fitting and the just below the sink drain. There'd been no major problems with the unit over the years, so I bought the same 1/3hp model. The new disposal isn't as beefy as the old one, but.... Installation was fairly easy. Have fingers crossed that this one will last at least half the life span of the old one."
3,"Good value, but not as quiet, long-lived as others","Our builder-installed InSinkErator died after four years of use, and we replaced it with this model, a slightly newer but similar model of the same brand. We chose this one because of the price and because we knew we could install it using the same fitting/space as the old one.This Badger is not as noisy as some, but it's not nearly as quiet as some of the upper end models. (We installed an upper end model in my parents' home a couple of months after we bought this one, and my parents' is *much* quieter.) Still, it is quieter than the original. I would rate it a ""moderate"" for noise.The disposer grinds food without problem, just as it should. If you have a large family and use a disposer heavily, I highly recommend going up to a 1/2 HP model. For moderate to light use, this model should be fine, although don't expect it to last more than five years or so."
5,Grinds as required ...,Perfect replacement for the same model installed in y house 16 years ago that failed. Easy to reinstall using existing fittings in sink and plumbing.
2,Badger 1 disposal,"Wow, I was just searching to replace my Badger 1 insikerator garbage disposal that was installed in our house when it was built only three years ago, and noticed all the leaky disposal reviews. Our Badger 1 is leaking like crazy and getting worse really fast. Guess we won't replace with the same model. Thanks for all the reviews, now I know it's not just ours."
1,Cracked and Useless,"Had a new house built in 06 and the builder installed the unit. Only stayed in the new house for a couple of months in 06 and a couple of months in 07 and finally moved in full time July of 08. Never had a disposal before so we really didn't use it to the full extent and only have two people living in the house. In Dec of 08 I noticed a leak under the sink and upon investigation found that the plastic housing where the waste pipe connects had about a 1/4"" crack. The unit hasn't been in use for even a year even though I'm sure I'll get ""its out of warranty"" proclamation. The motor still works but the unit is pretty much worthless since it leaks like a seive I'd stay away from this unit."
1,geniune leather the way fruit leather is genuine leather,"I should have known better given the price. this thing is garbage. Can't button the ear flaps up, weird chinstrap with plastic strap thing. Genuine leather is not true by any stretch. this is a plastic hat with rabbit fur. unwearable"
4,"Good collection, only worth it to fans","This isn't a product for anyone who's not a fan to buy; many of the tracks are ones that only people with a taste for the Dan would enjoy at first listen, such as King of the World and Green Earrings. There are some of the well known hits on there, but other greatest hits collections better capture both a look at Steely Dan's whole career, and their more catchy and popular music. I'll agree with the other reviewers: the real reason to get this is the last four tracks on the album, which you can't really find anywhere else. And yes, the drunken introduction in Bodhisattva really is kind of painful :P"
5,The Whole Package!,"Such a thought provoking film - I loved it! Not only is it beautifully shot, but the acting is superb."
4,"very informative, a tad outdated","This book is thoughtfully written and very informative. However, there has been a lot of educational reform in Japan since its publication."
3,"good training methods, but......","I like her training methods -- positive reinforcement, no negative ""punishment."" But, she's not the first to suggest this, nor necessarily the best. I definitely felt that the ""Tao"" part was an merely added as an attempt to set her ""style"" apart from others -- a superfulous & poorly integrated attempt in my opinion. Was a waste of my money; we've been training for 3 years."
2,dissapointing,"First of all, the plot was, well, bad. It just didn't seem to have the same spark as the rest of the series. Second, none of the original voice actors signed on to this, and the replacements were annoyingly bad. Even the animation seemed like whoever put this together didn't care, they just needed the excuse to bring in Krillin(which was a decent part of the plot, if the only part). I may be overly picky, but this video just wasn't up to par with the rest of the series. Oh well, I'll drown my sorrow in DBZ."
1,Older than dirt!!,I ordered this cartridge from DKR Books for July 2012 delivery. When it came it had an INSTALL BEFORE date of May 2004. Over 8 years old. I e-mailed the seller several times thru Amazon but DKR Books never responded. Thank goodness Amazon stood behind the transaction and refunded my money plus shipping costs. This is a seller problem and not a product problem.
1,It's A Dud!,"What can I say, other than this cartridge just didn't work. Well, it printed in pink but that's all. Tried priming the cartridge 3 times with same result. So... buy at your own risk!"
5,Helen Merrill is the same intimate jazz singer today...,"Helen Merrill is as great now, as she ever was. In fact she is the same intimate and cool toned vocalist that she was in the 50's. This Verve release is excellent. Merrill is excellent. Aside from Anita O'Day, Merrill is one of the top straight ahead jazz vocalists still performing today."
2,Cool but probably not for kids,"It really looks and feels neat, but I probably wouldn't buy it again.There are a whole bunch of safety warnings on the packaging that this is not intended as a pillow for sleeping - and that it's not a toy for kids either, purely decorative.It also has a strong chemical odor that does fade over time, but is still a bit disturbing."
3,Just not the one stop book,The book does a great job of covering about 70 percent of the actual exam. The other 30 percent (SmartDefense) is not even mentioned.
5,Billy's Favorite Moves Worked Me Out,"Billy truly delivered a good fun workout with his favorite moves. I like the serious side to Taebo, but I also like the fun side as well and you will find fun in this workout. Exercise should always be fun. This isn't the first Taebo workout that I have done, where Billy included fun in the workout.I believe that a person should always have fun exercising.I recommend this 43 minute cardio workout to Taebo fans, even if you are a veteran in Taebo. I'm a veteran. I have been doing Taebo off and on since 1999 and trust me, this workout will make you sweat."
5,Had to buy 2,This is a great machine. I've never had a phone with the range of this one and it's crystal clear with tons of features. I'm an electrical engineer so I knew the hardware inside the phone was top of the line. I loved it so much that I bought another one as a present for Christmas this year.
3,Not so great,"Amazingly, AT&T (or whoever the real manufacturer is) have missed some basic features. With the handset's keypad tone on, you still don't get any sound when pressing keys for digits or letters (if this is a problem particularry on this handset, it means their quality control is not good enough). Generally speaking, the controls are not so intuitive, the color dispay looks decent only at maximum contrast, battery life is mediocre, and there is only one preisntalled greeting on the answering machine. I believe there are better 5.8 GHz digital phones on this price range."
2,Whatever Happened to AT&T Quality?,"After two days the color display failed. The display looked like an old film with vertical lines and no color.The inability to share phone books also was a BIG drawback. I think I would have tolerated that, if the display did not fail. For the price, I expect quality and features. Not getting quality, is unacceptable at this price range. I learned that AT&T; really don't make these phones, VTech does.The Handset on this and the base unit E5965C do not fit the face well.Consumer Reports rated these phones high, but after using them for a week, I was really disappointed and returned the set for a refund.I am now considering the Panasonic KX-TG5776S"
1,"Good technology , bad execution","I purchased this phone based on it's good review at Consumer Reports, what a mistake! The sound quality was fine but the human factors/user interface was terrible, especially for a $270 phone (base + one phone). <ul> <li> Each phone has a separate phone book which can not be sync'd to the other phones. <li> The answering machine is not integrated with rest of the phone. One example is the volume controls both the answer machine and the base speaker phone, the two are not calibrated, if you switch between using the base speaker phone and the answering machine you need to adjust the volume each time. <li> Handset interface is not very good, the color screen servers no purpose. I really noticed how bad it was once I purchased Panasonic TG5433M. </ul> Do yourself a favor and get a Panasonic TG5433M instead, for the price of the base unit you get three phones which much better features."
2,Not good with wireless communication,"This is the second 5.8 we purchased and returned. It disconnects our wireless internet when the phone is in use. We have to turn the computer off and reboot to get it back once the call has ended. Funny, the label states this was developed just for wireless connections. We tried the Panasonic KX-TG5240M first which I commented on too.The sound quality seemed to be good and battery life okay, just kills the internet... Really liked some of the features, but was a little complicated to program. You only have to do that once, though. So, if you are not worried about the wireles internet and can work your way through the first programing, this might be a good choice.We are on our third brand, Radio Shack's 5.8. Funny, it cost a LOT less and so far no problems."
1,AT&T E5965C,"I did my research before I bought this phone and I am very dissappointed. First of all, I've had this phone for 2 months and the battery crapped out on me. I tried all the troubleshooting tips on the website (telephones.att.com)and it's pretty much a dead battery. I've emailed customer support to send me a replacement battery. DENIED. My co-worker had this same problem with a Panasonic cordless phone. And that phone was 8 months old. He called Panasonic and they sent him a new battery with ease. Therefore, I am very upset with AT&T Customer Service and with the phone itself. I should've went with another brand."
4,Very useful,"Excellent and well written book. Has most of the chips on the current market, but finding some on Ebay that arn't in the book. Hopfully they will expand the book in the next addition. The format is very easy to use. A web site to reference with updated / additional photos would be nice."
1,I give it one star rate only because of free shipping.,This is a very poor quality grinder. It is barely working and it goes to trash can directly after first using.
5,Affordable Value,Wide brim in the back provides great sun protection in the hot Texas sun. Quality is equal to the more expensive straw hats that I own. The fit runs true to size. Well packaged with quick delivery and good vendor communication. One of the better experiences that I have had in my over 10 years purchasing on Amazon. An exemplar.
5,Buttery MST3k goodness...,"Just a quick note to correct the earlier reviewer who said that the ""A Date With Your Family"" short has been edited for content -- that person's information is *incorrect*. I just played the DVD now, and Tom Servo very definitely and clearly says ""Dad, I'm dating a negro!"" So have no fear, all the jokes are in place."
3,MST3000 Vol. 2 is reasonable value for money,"Hi MST3000 fans,Volume2 of MST3000 is not bad at all.Of the set, the shorts volume 1 is my absolute favorite. Its nothing short of brilliant.The other three titles in the set are reasonable.Pod People stands out as the absolute stinker of the three full lenght features.Of course this makes for excellent MST material ;-)Anyhow all the best,EtienneSouth Africa"
5,EXCELLENT BOOK!,"I have read many Dillinger Books in my lifetime, but this is the BEST yet! I strongly recommend buying this one! The only people who will give this book a bad review are those who carry a deep hatred for criminals like John Dillinger. But he was part of our history and should be remember. I praise the author for writing such an amazing book. Thank you."
5,OUTSTANDING BOOK!,"THIS IS THE BEST WRITTEN BOOK EVER ON JOHN DILLINGER'S PERSONAL FAMILY LIFE THROUGH THE EYES OF HIS WIFE AND FRIENDS, AND A REAL LOOK AT AN OUTLAWS BANK ROBBING LIFESTYLE. THIS BOOK ADDS NEW PAGES TO HISTORY. I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR AUTHENTIC RESEARCH AND ACCURACY. THIS BOOK STANDS OR THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED, NOT WHAT OTHERS HAVE CLAIMED HAPPENED. I NOTICED A FEW RUDE AND UNJUST COMMENTS BY SOME HERE. IT IS EASY TO JUDGE, BUT TO BE TRUTHFUL IS ANOTHER. I BELIEVE THIS BOOK TO BE A MASTER PIECE OF TRUE FACTS. EXTREMELY GOOD READING! THANK YOU."
1,THE MOST AMATEURISHLY WRITTEN BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.,"This book is unreal....I still cannot believe that anyone could get something so crudely executed and simple-minded published.It`s sad enough that the ..'author'(one may as well call a Butcher a Surgeon) exhibits a personal bias that borders on mania in his slavish devotion to describing armed killers as heroes...But the text is so childishly written that I found myself hoping that the profits were spent on an education where one is apparently lacking.I hate to sound snobbish...But seriously...IT`S REALLY THAT BAD !My advice: Go for a copy of Matera`s 'John Dillinger' or Toland`s 'Dillinger Days'. You`ll get facts without hype, and an enjoyable, professional writing effort.This book was actually PAINFUL to read.As for the money I spent; I wish Dillinger himself could have stolen it, instead of some crude clown making a buck off his name."
2,Not the best music from the show,"I bought this for the wife since we expected the amazing music from the show. On first listen, we were sorely disappointed. The music was not at all what we expected - it was a lot of hip-hop/rap music which we don't listen to much. We didn't listen to it again for a few months after the initial hearing. However, I popped it back in with lowered expectations, and found that there are a few gems on the soundtrack. I do like the CD now, but it's just not what we were expecting. Be sure to listen to the songs on the CD before purchasing."
4,Surprisingly GOOD Beatle book!,"The Beatles is certainly an area I know well. Even among ""Beatles people"" I have a significant and deep knowledge. I came into this book with uncertainty: Taylor ""was there"" (not always a good source for accurate history!) but not too well-known among Beatle fans.As others have pointed out - he DOES have something to say, showing some unique and interesting details no one has discussed before. I'd have to say that it's among my favorite Beatles books ever! It's an easy read, and the stories are not TOO elaborate. I found only two factual errors in the whole thing - which is good, as I am SO picky about details.The ending is sad, and certainly true, but a good closing for a wonderful story..."
3,Great first person missions....HORRIBLE Kong controls....,"Hopefully that headline speaks for itself. The first person (Doom) style gameplay is excellent and stunning. The scenarios where you actually play as King Kong are really bad. Bad control, horrible camera switches/angles. It's truly like 2 different games! If the King Kong portions of this were released with no first person gameplay as Jack, I think this would have had the worst reviews since Shaq Fu. BUT, because the first person stuff is so visually stunning and controls perfectly, the game is good. It's strange that Peter Jackson even approved the Kong portions, but I guess he felt that's what fans wanted. There isn't a lot of freedom (like in Medal Of Honor) to explore in any direction. The pathways are narrow and the creatures have basic attack patterns, but it works overall. The jungle graphics are GEORGEOUS as is the sound design.....Worth a look."
4,Da Capo ...,"The Juvienile (did i spell that right?) is the best song on the whole CD, it alone is worth the money. It's pretty much what Cruel Summer should have been. Cruel summer was a bummer, but this one is great. A couple of the songs aren't that great, but most are.The Juvienile tell an interesting perspective on how the world needs to remember that juvieniles are the key the future and that you can't just forget about them, because we are the future.Da Capo's in your future"
4,convert,"I first heard this a year an a half ago because I knew somebody who knew somebody who could get me a free copy. So of course it was given to me with an explanation of its brilliance. I thought there were some great pop songs on it but I wasn't crazy about it. I put it aside. Then, sometime last year I heard ""summer at shatter creek' I liked ""summer at shatter creek"", but it made me think - 'greentrials was at least this good'. so i gave greentrials another listen. I didn't fall in love with it then, either, but I had a newfound respect for it, and since then, this record (eaglets, that is) keeps growing on me. I've gone from being a sorta fan of a few songs to thinking it's pretty darn great. If you prefer a live band captured on record, you won't like it. IT won't hit you in that immediate, visceral way. If you're a fan of great songwriting and orchestration, definitely check it out."
2,John Gray's book VERY basic,"As a psychotherapist, I am always looking for self-help booksto refer to my clients to help them understand more deeplysome of the issues we discuss. John Gray's book, like his others,is very basic, very simple and good for people who have no ideaabout how to approach or work with thsir feelings. If you're someonewho has been through good insight indepth therapy, this book is waytoo simple, a beginner's book. He uses alot of cartoon-like picturesand it almost feels condescending.I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who has done any work on themselvesat all. If you have just started the work, perhaps, but there are othersthat are better written to help one begin their journey."
3,Gorgeous illustrations; story is so-so....,"The beautiful illustrations really make this book. The pictures in which the animals help Nell build the snowman are delightful. However, I didn't find the story's message very clear or meaningful. A child shouldn't have to prove herself to her own family, as does the child in this story."
1,Paul Meier should be flayed alive,"Oh my, this was horrible.Wow, powerfully bad.I've never read such an awful regurtitation of poorly-contrived bilgewater. This was foul in the way a ruptured sewer main is, fetid in the way of a swamp full of rotting skunk cabbage, horrifying as you would be if you watched an entire graveyard of mouldering corpses was suddenly burped up from the ground.I wouldn't recommend this, even as a way to inflict an agonizing, craze-enducing execution.Good God, never let anything this bad ever soak up valuable paper resources."
1,Substandard Literature,"I hate to be a naysayer, but Paul Meier's book, THE THIRD MILLENIUM is trite and predictable. The Christian characters are insipid and lack dimension. If you are easily amused and like a book that you can read easily without engaging much of your mind, this may be for you. If you are tired of poor literature being passed off as GOOD in the Christian fiction genre, then you'll want to bypass this novel."
1,Not very good,"This is one of the worst endtimes novels I've ever read. The dialouge is horrible, the characters paper thin and the plot obvious and boring. There's much better out there. Save your money and try We All Fall Down by Caldwell or the Last Day by Kleier. Both are thoughtful, wonderful reads. This is neither"
3,Not bad,"I read some of the reviews on here before buying. There weren't many good reviews, but I took a chance any ways. I enjoy this movie. I think it is some what like the first Road House. It's not as good. But I am ok with that."
2,Pinaud Clubman Virgin Cologne,"plastic bottle lacks quality and not very suitable for gift. From the exterior looks it seems dated material. Although the price is good but wont buy it again, its good for fun party games and giveaways."
2,Disappointed,"I love the regular Clubman scent and really like Bay Rum, so I thought I would enjoy this. But it has some funky smell that didn't sit right with me. I will stay with the regular Clubman and when I want the Bay Rum scent I will try other products."
4,"Strong scent, adequate duration, feels like fire!","I have used the ""traditional"" Clubman scent in the past and I enjoy Bay Rum aftershaves so I thought I would give this a try. I was pleasantly surprised. The Bay Rum scent is strong out of the bottle, a little too much alcohol for my preference but you can hold the liquid in your hands for a minute to let the alcohol burn off. The scent is decently strong but not overpowering and lasts into the afternoon (I have an oily face, as well).One caveat, my face was ON FIRE for a full 5 minutes after applying! It was refreshing, but be warned!"
5,Exceptional Resource for EMDR Trained Professionals!,"I bought this book as a recommendation from another collegue for specific needs with one client and was primarily interested in one particular chapter related to addictions. When I began reading I had a difficult time stopping. Each chapter was a jewel. I could think of numerous clients that I could assist using these expanded or adapted protocols and strategies. The best resource I have ever spent money on! If you are an EMDR trained clinician, this book is a must have!"
4,Very good on subject but could do without the social lecture,"This has a great deal of good info on turning deerskins into buckskins, which is what one would expect from a book with such a title. I bought this book primarily to find ways to better prepare the skins of small game animals like rabbits, fox etc. And for that purpose the book was NOT intended, so I'm still looking. The one really bad point about the book is that the author was/is a hippie (not that there is anything wrong with that) but I found it really irritating to have to read through a bunch of social comentary which was really irrelavant to the topic of the book in order to get at all the useful info. But, hey! That's just me. You just might dig it. Yeah man! Groovy. ;)"
2,Always get the original version,Once again MGM has packaged three great films but in their pan and scan versions. It will be better to get them seperately in the letterbox versions.
2,Expected better,"It would have been much better with wide screen presentation, Gigi also lacks quality in soung and the magnificent viewes of Paris are lost. Of the whole collection, An american in Paris comes as the best picture in this format. Not worth the money"
1,"Unfortunate, the world is out to get him.",The only thing that this book states to me is that there are too many opportunities for criminals to appeal a just sentence. He needs to except the fate he chose for himself.
2,Waste of Paper,"I was surprised by the ""size"" of this book when it arrived. I think it was over-priced based on the contents. I didn't find much information that I will use in this book. It will probably be added to items to be given to charity or my next garage sale."
3,Same Story,"The stories were entertaining, but after the first few, it seemed as though they were all basically the same story. I expected a little bit more variety from Lawrence Block"
5,The best jkd book on the market,Hi all!! Kevin Seaman is one of the best authorities on JKD!!! This book by far will exceed expectations for any level of JKD practitioner!!! A must have for the serious JKD martial artist!!
5,Hilary Duff has a broken heart!!!,Hil is at it again! but not glamorous as she now has her heart broken! indeed i shall not tell but it's the coolest book in 7th grade!! you should read it or other wise ya don't know wat it's like!!
2,Disappointing,"I would think that anything the History channel produces would at the very least be interesting. And yet, this series was incredibly dull and drawn out. In a word? BORING."
1,Crap,"This isn't the best DVD. in fact the front cover is very misleading. The picture on the front cover is the concert I wanted to see, and that concert isn't apart of the package. I pretty upset as I am sure most people are since there are alot of used copies for sale and the DVD has only been out a couple months."
5,Great stuff but some of you reviewers are clueless,"First, to all of you who complained about the sound or picture quality: You are all idiots. What do you expect from 1968 recordings, 2009 quality???You should just be happy that you get the priviledge of seeing the greatest entertainer in history perform in his prime.His performance of 'Bewildered' from the Apollo DVD, in and of itself, is worth the price of the whole collection."
3,A story rather than a history,While the author does a decent job of telling the story around the Siegfried line he fails to cover more analytical aspects of the Siegfried line. The book isn't written in scholarly style and is better for WWII buffs than for researchers.
2,Hard to clean,"It worked Okay, but what a pain in the butt to clean. I probably won't use it again unless it is the only thing that will work. It didn't work well for shrimp and scallops. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Doesn't fit on my weber gas grill,"I have a 3 burner Weber gas grill (E-310 which has 536 sq in of grilling space) and this basket does not sit well on it- if I close the cover, the basket ends up getting lifted into the air above the grates. Also, small vegetables will fall out of the basket. Whole fish however is nice and snug in this springy grill basket.As one reviewer mentioned, spraying the basket with oil prior to putting in your product will ease cleanup- this product can not be put in the dishwasher.Also, the handle can get a little hot when on the grill.Overall, the product is made nicely but may not sit will on a small grill."
4,Easy & Straight forward,"This item was just about the easiest little gadget to set up right out of the box. The only difficult item was the stand that holds up the headset. Unfortunately we weren't able to make proper use of if because the microphone didn't work on our device. The biggest surprise was finding a merchant that carried it (Walmart discontinued it) or had it at a reasonable price (over $100 at Staples), thankfully Amazon came to the rescue and we had our headset system for the right price and in stock, just wish the mic worked (otherwise 5stars)."
3,Not as good as I hoped,"The sound quality on the Plantronics S11 headset I received was quite poor, so I contacted Plantronics. The company sent another one very promptly (though I have to pay the postage to return the bad one to them). The replacement was better, but is still not as clear as I would like, and not as clear as the old Plantronics headset that I had for years before this one."
1,Design Incompetence,"Whoever designed this headset stand needs to find another job, it's an utter failure.For this price, the base needs to offer a normal 2.5mm plug interface. Not worth its price."
2,Not good,Cord was only 2 ft long so if I had to grab something out of the far drawer of my desk I would have to take it off. Also the settings were confusuing and I was getting a lot of backround noise. I ended up returning it and purchase a plantronics bluetooth headset that I love!
4,Plantronics Headset,"I like Plantronics equipment and only wish that the wireless version of their headsets were cheaper. I have a slightly older model of this headset at work and like it a lot. This particular head set, which I got for home is fine, but it has two small problems. First, for some reason they made the band that goes over the top of the head thicker. That means that it doesn't fit on the wire hook that extends from the back of the connecting box. This leads to more desk clutter and a tendency to get all the wires tangled. The second problem is that I have a small desk fan and if it is on when I'm using the head set, the sound of the fan gets picked up by the microphone and so there's an annoying ""whoosh"" heard by both parties.Overall, the product does what it's supposed to do and is reliable."
4,D&D Race Series Collection,"This is a excellent collection, it has all the information you need about the core races, plus some new ones. Great deal rather then buying them individually. A must for D&D Players and DM alike."
4,flavor for your campaign,"Well with the arrival of the 4ed. you may think this is a dead supplement...well not at all. The mechanics and rules are really dead, but the flavor text dont. This three books provide a huge dose of informations about the major races of the DeD world. The social characteristics, the phisiology, and many other aspects of each race is very well explained. The artwork could be better, but the information is really precious. If u don't agreed with the new cosmology or the race changes of 4ed., this is a good book for you, if you loved what they did in 4ed., forget about this."
4,5.8? You judge,"Note the 5825 does not have an answering machine (the 5850 does).To start, I want to point out that this is actually a hybrid 2.4/5.8 system. The handset transmits @ 2.4GHz and the base @ 5.8 GHz. (I remember Panasonic did a similar thing with their first 2.4 phones which actually used 2.4 and 900MHz.) So if you think this phone will be 100% interference free from 2.4 GHz sources you may be disappointed (though I have not had any problems yet with our other 2.4G phone). Now leaving that, I find that this phone works quite well. The sound is good with normal use, speakerphone and headset. I especially like that there is only one phonebook that either handset can access. I also like that it uses regular AAA NiMH batteries (included).I took off one star because of the extremely limited way you can edit names/numbers in the phone book. For example, you cannot add a ""1"" in front of a number. You have to delete the whole number and re-enter it. Same with names."
3,Its okay,"Its just okay; 5.8G but my panasonic 2.4 has better sound quality to it. In this package you get two sets, master one and the other one. The only good thing is that the other set needs to be connected to the power socket only (no need to hook it up to the phone jack as long as the master base is hooked up) so it means you can place it anywhere in the house irrespective of having access to a phone jack nearby. Once again sound quality aint that good.Addendum: Lately one of the handset is giving me problems; cant receive calls on this one.PS (added after 3 months) Dont buy this set. I have learned it the hard (and expensive) way."
3,I am confused and upset!,"See now... I have loved this phone for the year that I have had it. After the year I noticed battery charging issues. At first I assumed it was because every year batteries need to be changed. Well after coming on here I discovered that a lot of reviewers were posting the same issue that I was experiencing. The main unit base overheats to the point of making you pull back from it. That handset can be charged overnight, then when you pick it up you realize that there was a Warning: Check Battery error displaying and all that charging was rendered useless.I really love how everything else is but after discovering this I guess I have to switch from this company. I don't really feel like wasting 20 bucks on batteries considering that the main base runs so hot. I think it may actually be what others are complaining about. And yessss! you have to pop out the battery and the phone will work for a bit. SUCKY! VTECH... you suck... recall this product."
1,$9.10....are you crazy,Are you guys crazy paying 9 dollars for 4 bars? You can buy this soap at the dollar store. SUCKAFISH!
5,Great soap,"I was looking for a soap that would not dry my hands after using and this is it. I no longer need to apply hand cream after washing my hands! Oh, and it smells amazing!! It also has exfoliating abilities as it has scrubbing ""stones"" on the surface, I wasn't expecting that but it's a plus in my book."
1,Pretentious,"I like some avant garde filmmaking, in particular animation, ex. Norman Mclaren, Harry Smith. But I feel like these Brakhage films are a farce of what an art film is supposed to be like. The filmmaker seems to take what he is doing so seriously that it goes into parody of an ""art"" film. I've seen college level work and home movies that are more insightful and entertaining. I had the chance once to see Stan Brakhage live in New York to screen one of his newer films a few years back. It was a film he shot in Vancouver of the beach, and, seriously, it was like watching somebody's home movies of the beach. Then afterwards he goes into a discussion about the film and how it represents him dealing with illness and life and death. He was so pretentious and full of himself I had to laugh. The emperor has no clothes."
5,BUY THIS RIGHT NOW!,"Unfortunatelly we don't have enough stars to rate this marvelous collection of films .Definitely this is worthing more than five stars!As you cannot rate Dante or Pound,Bach or Stravinsky,Michelangelo or Picasso, you cannot rate Eisenstein or Brakhage.This a strong statement, but believe me, I mean it!A very few people realize that these films are in some part our future cinema.Just take a look at such films as, Mouline Rouge,Seven or Amelie!THis is for the people who like to think!JUst give it a try!"
4,A RIPPER OF A YARN,"It's amazing how much action Sax Rohmer crams into this short, 192-page book. In it, Commissioner Nayland Smith and his cohort, Dr. Petrie, travel around London trying to rescue various chaps from murder, kidnapping, memory loss and assorted attacks perpetrated by the evil Chinese mastermind, Dr. Fu Manchu. The pace of the book is quite breathless, and before all is said and done, we have dealt with poisonous centipedes, opium dens, trapdoors, memory drugs, mummies, poison gas, thugees and dacoits, ship raids, hashish, zombies, poison mushrooms, swamp adder drugs and on and on. Like I said, Rohmer throws a lot into this one, all for the pleasure of the adventure-loving reader. Who cares if it's not PC? This is a ripper of a yarn, as they used to say, and a nice intro to the other 13 books in the Fu Manchu series."
5,CONVERT A BENCH,Assembly was pretty easy and they look great. We liked the 1st one so well we ordered another one.
5,Great tables,"These are really great tables. They are sturdy. They stay clean, and can be easily wiped or sprayed off.They can be used as a bench or flip the back forward and they become either one small table with a small table surface or put two tables facing together as a full picnic table.I'm very pleased with these. They put together easy and are of high quality.A little pricey but worth it, considering they will weather very well, considerably better than wood or cheap plastic outdoor tables."
4,Great bench/table top,I love this bench. We use it outside our back door in the table top position. We keep our shoes on the top shelf and there is plenty of room to sit on it and take your shoes off and on. Center support should have been designed to go to the ground to make the middle of the bench sturdier but otherwise it is a good bench.
5,Excellent Value,"I am extremely pleased with this bench! I wanted a bench for my back yard that was durable, functional, appealing, and reasonably priced. After much searching I ran across the convert-a-bench on Amazon. It met all my criteria - and more! It arrived in record time. I assembled it in short order, with neighbors curiously watching. Like me, they loved how attractive it is and gushed over the conversion from bench, to bench with table. I highly recommend this product and feel certain that anyone who buys it won't be disappointed. I may buy another one to put on my deck!"
2,Ejoyable for quick summer thrills; not for realist buffs.,"If you like fish stories that are ""the bigger the better"" without all the scientific jargon, then by all means read this book."
3,Incomplete Focus,"An interesting variation of the vampire theme: the vampire as sexual predator. However, I found one important element missing.The chapters varied the focus on the different characters, but there were not any chapters telling the story from the vampire's point of view. We never got into Gideon's head to see what made him tick.And though there were detailed horror scenes, we saw only one detailed, but too brief description of Gideon in action as a sexually predatory vampire.Good idea, but could have been better."
2,Definitely not worth the 5 star reviews,"Come on folks! If you add five star positive reviews for just about anything you listen too then the difference between good and bad will be lost. I was very disappointed with this album and also didn't find Pausini to be as good as some of the reviwers have claimed her to be. My suggestion is that you listen to the music first and then order it if you like it, but don't get it based on good reviews alone, like I did!"
5,Enchanting Emotions,"I have been listening to this cd for over 2 years now, and I still haven't gotten tired of it. Even non-italian listeners, will appreciate her serene but powerful voice. She lets you know the song's story through her enchanting voice. Definitely worth a listen."
4,animal fan,authentic reproduction of the fun and follies associated with coping with pets and their owners.Malcolm Welshman's fiction conveys the veterinary surgeons'surface serenity beneath which exists a daily practice of quite and sometimes extreme desperation.Very engaging.Liked it a lot so far.
4,Ok first album...great live band at the time !,"Hmmm, first got into this band at Stonehenge festival in 1984, after watching the festivities for a bit we went back to the tent & cranked this, 'Camembert Electric' by Gong & 'In Search Of Space' by Hawkwind till the wee hours...ha ha ha ! What a laugh !The Maximum Effect is a way better album by ICU, hope that comes out one day, cheers !"
5,This album made me want to learn Spanish!,"Wow! This album is so awesome, even though I only understood about 25% of the words, I loved it and listened to it over and over again. Then, I started learning Spanish becasue I wanted to know what alll the somgs were about. Wow, this girl's voice is emotional, captivating, and can make a non-Spanish speaker go out and learn some Spanish!"
1,I find this CD to be lagging..zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,This CD is a sleeper.. there is only one song that is good and that is obsession. Buy the Single and save some $$$$$.. I also don't want Amazon.com to own my review.
4,70's Nostalgia,"BTO did pen some popular songs after spinning off from The Guess Who. I actually saw BTO in concert at Hampton Roads Colosseum (Virginia) in the early 1970's. The opening act happened to be Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band (go figure...). Little did I know that the bands would end up on opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to career longevity. Regardless, I like this album because it contains one gem that never got the recognition that it deserves... the very mellow, ""Blue Collar"" (cut #7). Try playing ""Blue Collar"" at night when you're cruising down the Interstate or a back-country road... the lyrics and beat really make the drive a pleasure. I only wish BTO would have drifted in that same direction with other songs."
3,Another Non-Love Tractor record,"Decent enough tunes, but without the two crucial founding members who co-created the first five Love Tractor albums, (over a twenty year period no less), the magic of previous era is certainly missing. As a die hard fan, I do appreciate what Mike is doing here; I may have warmed up to this more had he supplemented the new project with a new moniker."
4,The Worlds Greatest Detective!,"Batman: The Dark Knight Adventures is a pretty decent collection of some of the Batman stories featured in the monthly ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" comic serires. While none of the stories really stand out there a still good enough to hold you're attention. If you're looking for a good kick-back summer read, buy this and you won't be dissapointed. Peace."
1,Beatles fans - FORGET IT.,"Think this is a Beatles CD collection of 45's - WRONG.It's just an ordinary compilation CD (Various Artists, The Beatles have ONE track called 'My Bonnie' - From Hamburg Days).As a compilation it holds no surprises and am sure that there are better ones to be found.Norman Bonello Fri28Aug98"
1,dubbed 2000 series,"If you are used to watching BTB of the BBC 1998 series you will be extremely disappointed. Bob and his gang's voice have changed & so is their favorite line to 'can we dig it'. There should be options for English,American English & others."
2,Kind of strange,This was our first Bob DVD and maybe I just chose wrong. My son waited for the theme song the whole time and it never played. Maybe that is the norm...This whole thing is kinda strange. My son likes it but doesn't love it.I simply should have researched more.
2,The best of all!,"Bob the builder had lots of adventures, & this one is the best!Bob & his gang have to mend an old castle. That's right! A old spooky castle! Luckily, there are no badies so young children will enjoy it too! Young kids find it easy to get scared. This shall be a great video for children who get haunted. Did you know that you can see Skip, a new character, in the background?I must not say any more or I might spoil it for you!"
2,Over-rated Religious Progressive Theme Music,"I think my title sums it up. I can't get into this at all. Too many ""God"" and ""Jesus"" lyrics. I guess I don't like being preached to when I'm in the prog mood. His work with Spock's Beard was great, but this is too hard to swallow."
2,"Obnoxious, mean characters ruin this episode","I have really like the first 3 episodes in this series, and my young kids have, too. Our viewing has coincided with an interest in dinosaurs by my 4 year-old son. So, he's learned a lot about dinosaurs from them. And the movies are wholesome and promote friendship and good behavior.THIS EPISODE WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT BECAUSE OF THE MEAN-SPIRITED BANTERING OF THE TWO VILLAINS. The prehistoric crocodile and pterasaur (dinosaur bird) are constantly telling each other how much they ""hate"" each other. There is a song they sing back and forth about how ""I need you like a hold in the head"" and that type of thing. And their voices are terribly annoying.I was immediately uncomfortable, but then I heard my son starting to say this stuff to his sister...HEY, I KNOW THE KIDS ARE GOING TO PICK UP MEAN LANGUAGE SOMEWHERE, BUT WHY ENCOURAGE IT?MY ADVICE: LAND BEFORE TIME I-III DO NOT SUFFER FROM THIS LOW LANGUAGE."
1,WHAT!?!?!?,"WHAT IN THE NAME OF GOD IS THIS?!?! This is definately not a Land Before Time movie! We have two incredibly dumb-as-a-doorknob and very idiotic villians with really boring names. We have an incredily dumb plot where ""What's his face's grandfather"" is ill. I mean, COME ON!! Give the audience a better plot like a race against time or something! But introducing a female dinosaur amazingly similair to that dumb dino-brain is just plain boring. Then that brainless oaf Spike actually says one word for once: Ducky. Couldn't he have said something like ""Wow! I can finally talk?"" But when we finally think he is going to say something after he discovers he can talk, what does he do? He just inhales and eats a big pile of cowpie. If you have a child who likes LBT, save him the misery and the lousy amount of money for something else."
1,Scary for young children,This series of videos is scary for young children. Do not let the G rating fool you. I watched the video with my three year old son who loves dinosaurs and he was scared during several of the scenes. Also there is a lot of name-calling and teasing in the videos. Not something I want my child learning. Very poorly done story lines. Pick Dinosaur Train or Dino Dan instead!
2,Not what I expected.,I was rather disappointed with this book. Not much interesting I learned about the City. Lots of advertisement. I was expecting something much better.
3,OK but you don't need it,If you live near by and go frequently then maybe this book would be of use.
5,Finally A Great Chillout CD,"This CD has it all: mood, music and a really cool cover. Other ""Various Artist"" compilations disappoint due to lack of focus...they slap chillout in the title and give little thought to the actual musical content. Cabana Beach Club sets a vibe and then rides along its own undulating wave...there was a lot of thought behind this. This CD has a lot of new stuff as well as a cool remix of The Door's ""Riders on the Storm"" and tracks by Thievery Corporation and Nightmares on Wax. Even Chichi Peralta shows up in an Ibiza remix. I first heard this in an ultra-trendy restaurant in Miami... the server said people ask about it all the time. This is a must for fans of chillout with a global beat backdrop."
4,A Taste Of Ambient Trans Music...,"I picked this up recently on a whim and I'm glad I did. It's a good ""chill"" CD which takes the listener on a journey deep in the mind's eye. My only negative point is after track #11, it slowly turns more techno and kind of ruins the state of mind I was in when I first put it on."
5,This story is also in Richard Scarry's Best Storybook Ever,"Just wanted to let other shoppers know that this story can also be found within the book entitled, ""Richard Scarry's Best Storybook Ever."" When my sisters and I were little, ""Good Night, Little Bear,"" was one of our favorite stories in the Best Storybook Ever. If you don't already own a copy of the Best Storybook Ever, I highly recommend obtaining one. It's a collection of many short stories like ""Good Night, Little Bear,"" as well as some silly one-page stories that capture the attention of little ones."
1,Not in depth review; only anectdotal stories.,"Kava is a great herb and you should know more about this herb. But if you are looking for more than stories that you can find yourself by browsing, this book is not for you.This book is useless if you are looking for in depth review about kava. The only things in this book are stories and anectdotal experience from kava users that you can actually see on the internet.The worst thing about this book is the author recommend the use of kava for hyperactive child to stoned them."
3,Break it down,"As a beginner climber, I was hoping for more detailed breakdowns and more diagrams related to the technique of climbing. At times, moves such as locking-off are introduced and never explained. The section on equipment and hand grips is adequate. Many of the photos are small and lacking detail. Overall for the price the book, you are getting what you pay for. I'm hoping Comp Guide to Rock Climbing, which I have on order is more rewarding."
4,A Perfect Ending!,"This is my second Johanna Lindsey book and I really enjoyed it...At first however it was a bit slow for me to climb in to but then I don't typically read a western type historical...but once the details were in place and the characters met, the story soared! The chapters flew and it never lagged... I found my self intrigued by the clever lies each was telling the other in the name of self preservation... I never found their deceptions to detract from the core fact that these two were truly falling in love with each other and their true identities...because you can only conceal so much... actions will always speak louder than words... And I have to say the ending was SO clever! And it all made sense... I love it when I can read a book and be as surprised as the character as they experience the twist!I am very eager to move on to another of her books...MindyL"
5,Outstanding...Informative and humorous. A must read for Dad,This book was very good. A great tip book for new fathers...particularly first time dads.Highly recommended!!!
5,Incredibly Warm and Human...,"...Just like the band itself. Rock and Roll is a romantic mystery to many. But to watch a talented group of adults commited to making great music through thick and thin for so many years say a long goodbye to one another cuts as deep as the best lyric or the best songs. This is a bittersweet goodbye, maybe not only for this band, but for authenticity and, well, love, in an increasingly sterile business."
2,"Wow, I really like Luna, but...","I've been a fan since 1995. I love the music, I saw them play live, I bought several albums at import prices b/c I was able to get them one week - two months in advance. That said, this movie is sub-par.We do not learn anything beyond what happens on and is said on this tour. Aside from a few, like three, anecdotes about tours past. We do not learn where the band members are from or anything about their biographies that is noteworthy. We only learn surface details about their lives. The whole movie seems rushed and thrown together.The two stars are awarded b/c there are some great live recordings on the disc, whole songs even. That is it. If you can get the thing on the cheap, do it. Otherwise, buy with extreme caution.PS, I like, ""Watch Me Jumpstart,"" ""The Devil & Daniel Johnston,"" ""Slow Century"" and all the Talking Heads movies, documentary or otherwise. So I am not just dismissing this ""rockumentary"" w/out basis."
3,Doesn't work on Athlon64 Systems,"Adapter works fine on non PAE (physical address extensions) enabled systems. However, the drivers are not compatible with 64 bit systems, like the Athlon64, which use PAE. The manufacturer does plan to produce a driver but does not know when."
4,My review,"Got this way before I thought I would, which pleases me greatly. However, please do not put stickers on the DVD cases again. I had a terrible time removing them. It left residue on them and i'm not pleased by that. Anyways the discs are in great shape and I sat down and enjoyed some episodes last night."
1,if there was a lower star i would choose it,this game was unbelived to be the most anoying game i have ever played.i hate the jumping and the runing around you have to do.when it says action no theres none all u do is swip a sward and they walk in to you thats why you need never buy this game.its up to you but thats the truth.when i heard the story line i thougth it would be good save your self from the castle gain your trown back all bull dont buy unless you want to waste money.gameboy color please try this time
5,"fluid mechanics ,transprtation of fluids","it is the best books i have ever read in my semester ofchemical engineering. the topic i like the most, is transportation offluids .this book is recommended by my professor. the matter of turbulent flow and laminar flow is just fantastic.thank you!"
1,This book is inadequte,"I feel that this book is inadequte for students and professionals alike. It does not explain well how systems act in real life situations, like most academia books"
2,Graphics Good. Game Boring.,"While this game has some excellent graphics, after a while the scenery gets old. The challenges get redundant as you search for sticks or fire or ammo, or shoot at raptors or big bird things scene after scene (after scene after scene). As Kong, mobility is limited to a single correct path that you have to find. Players have little freedom of movement, and while swinging from branch to branch, or running along the side of a cliff or building looks cool, players have limited control over where Kong goes. Not Fun. The game is also very short. Less than 10 hours of play."
5,loved it,this is a great movie for children me and my husband get a kick out of watching it too. would recomend it
1,Stop!!!!!,Enough already! The first one was good and came out when I was 5. Now 6 years later there's a 6th movie. It wasn't very cool. The kids I babysit for hated it!
3,Just another clicker book,"This book was a good deal, however it did not keep my attention. To this day my dog is not clicker trained."
1,ANOTHER DUMB BOOK FOR DUMBER OWNERS!!!,"Click, click, click, let's just give the dog treats and have him lose total respect for you. That's right. You become the ""briber"" instead of the ""provider."" The only time this device makes sense is if you are mute.Haven't you seen super trained dogs WITHOUT the clicker? If this method is so smart and so effective, why is it we don't hear or see it in the news? Why clicker training hasn't been on Oprah, Larry King or Charlie Rose? Because it's crap."
3,A warning about the Japanese threat in WWII,"America's ambassador to Tokyo for the ten years before Pearl Harbor tells why the Japanese think they can win this war and what we must do to defeat them.Joseph Grew was the US Ambassador to Tokyo for the 10 years before Pearl Harbor. On his return home he was shocked at how dangerously Americans underrated the Japanese, and began a series of addresses on the ""real nature of this enemy"". The book is based on these lectures. He was able to leave in August 1942, an alert that the common American public assumption that Japan is weak is unfounded, and that they are at least as potent an enemy as Germany. The book, published under wartime conditions, does not challenge American pre-War policy. However, it sounds an alarm about the struggle ahead. ."
4,It gave me itchy feet!,"This is a wonderful introduction to the history of pilgrimage in Ireland. It is accessible (and entertaining with it); it is full of facts and folklore; it has marvellous plates. It is a companionable book: I felt that I was listening to a guide who not only had the story of each particular site but could relate them to pilgrimage patterns elsewhere in Ireland and abroad. The author obviously knows and loves his subject.Coming as I do from an ancient place of pilgrimage - the parish of Glencolmcille (""the valley of the dove of the church"") in County Donegal - I had never before experienced a yearning to go on pilgrimage in any other county in Ireland, apart from the Reek/Croagh Patrick in County Mayo, but this book has given me itchy feet!One of the many nice things about this book is the author's generous praise of other writers. Go on buy this book! You don't have to be religious or spiritual or new-agey to enjoy it!"
4,Speaker jack,Because the case has dimensiopnality to it it generates a smaller length for an external speaker system jack to fit in the iPod. So unless it is pushed down hard and kept down a connection won't be made
3,Mostly very good,"I picked this cd up after seeing Hillman and Pedersen in concert recently. This could easily have been a 4 star effort if not for ""The Mystery that won't go away"". It's one thing for bluegrass to have a murder song like 'Tom Dooley' that tells an obscure story that may not have ever been known otherwise. It's another thing to be allowing the tabloids to determine the importance of a story that never should have been a worldwide concern. It's hard to believe that the group would have gone along with including that number on the album."
3,A Tribute To The B-3 Yeah!,"As a Keyboard player myself, I bought this in hopes of learning from it. I have been playing lead guitar 51 years.In the early 80's, the Hammond organ sound that I loved working with was falling by the wayside in favor of small light weight synthesizers with piano and organ want-to-be sounds. I missed the good organ sounds so much that I bought a small Hammond portable and an electric piano. I decided to add another Guitarist to the band and I would learn keybosrd stuff. With a lot of patience from my band mates we worked me over to keys, eventually I wound up not playing guitar that much. So even though I have been playing almost 30 years now, I still try to learn and pick-up new licks etc. From that standpoint this DVD is a bit of a disappointment, if I had had it 30 years ago, it would have helped. He doesn't really show me anything I can't already do, If you are a beginner this will help,"
3,Interesting Thesis,Honor and Shame takes a look at the way cultures base their behaviors. The theme is very interesting and helpful for anyone working with Honor/Shame styles. I wish that the book included more anecdotes and stories to support the thesis. There were a couple of good examples like the response when a lifeguard blows a whistle.
5,this one is a real jewel,"I had no idea when I bought this cd that I would be so pleased. I love every single cut on the album and highly recommend it to not just merengue lovers but to anyone who enjoys latin pop. Marco Hernandez is extremely talented and Hector Anibal's voice is pure dinamite! I live in the D.C. area and had the pleasure of listening in on a radio show they were on and it seems they're having a real good time. With all that talent, it doesn't surprise me at all. Hopefully they'll come back to D.C. with a concert. I'll be anxiously waiting."
3,"Nice illustrations & very descriptive, incomplete","This book is really a book about Barre and Adagio exercises. The Allegro exercises are supposedly in a companion text, though descriptions of adagio techniques are included (assemble, pas de chat, etc.). But it's a very nice book for just the basics. The barre in here is simple and straightforward, though also missing common exercises like fondu and developee. The french is a little over-the-top compared to what really gets used in a class, but it's nice to read something so robustly written with regards to dance once in a while.I bought it because I'm trying to get into ballet teaching. I'm disappointed that there are not allegro routines, but those exercises included come with a reasonable number of cues to aid instruction & learning."
4,Good for the Money,"'89 Civic didn't come with a tach. Mounted this one on the steering column with little effort. Works great. I also have a Toyota pickup with a small Autometer gauge. Both tachs work equally well. If you care where they are made, the Equus comes from Taiwan and the Autometer is made in the USA."
1,EGOTISTICAL DRIVEL MASQUERADING AS KNOWLEDGE.,IT NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE ME HOW SOME PEOPLE CAN PASS THEMSELVES OFF AS EXPERTS IN A FIELD THAT THEY OBVIOUSLY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. MR GUNNELL POSES AS AN AUTHORITY USING HIS POSITION AT KRAUSE PUBLICATIONS AS A SHIELD. IN REALITY HE JUST REGURGITATES WHAT OTHERS HAVE WRITTEN BEFORE HIM.
2,Very bad quality DVD,"This review concerns the DVD quality only. The story is fine. The sound is very difficult to hear and the picture very grainy, to the point that I can barely stand to watch the films. You get what you pay for, I guess!"
3,Serves the purpose.,"Sound quality on these mics is really average at best. I almost always get a little bit of hissy static in the background, no matter how close I am to the receiving unit. Also, the power plug for the receiving unit is VERY touchy. I always have to jiggle it a bit to get it to eventually find the right place that allows it to receive a current. And then I have to hope that it'll stay in that position. Make sure you have no obstructions between the mics and the receiving unit when using this system. Also, even though the mics have a 'standby' setting, it doesn't work at all. It's either on, or off."
1,Mixed reviews about this,"First off the feel of it feels like you are going to break it. Second watch out when you change the battery, when you screw the bottom on, you can break the whole microphone. It cuts in and out. Very poorly made."
2,Skip this model! Move on to another.,"I purchased these to use for our church group event at my house, and based on my experience with them, Amazon shouldn't even allow them to sell on their website. The range is very poor. I can't even get them to go 8 feet in a wall-less (?) room without getting fuzzy and breaking up. Plus, when you get out of range, in order to restore the signal, you have to go all the way back to the receiver and physically TOUCH the bottom of the mic to the antenna. One of the two antenna receivers broke while I was putting it away, and I'm not careless with my stuff.So, trust me, you won't get any good use out of this model. Naxa is not a good brand. If you're looking for something cheap, but good, go with Nady. If you don't have too much of a price limit, go with Shure or Audio-Technica. You'll enjoy those brands much more."
1,Worse microphones I have ever seen,"Tried saving a little money on some cheap microphones.... I took them out of packaging, put batterys in, turned on and after 2 minutes with them, I put them back in the packaging and sent them back. Worse Microphones ever. Dont even waste your money. They cut in and out and ALOT of STATIC"
1,VERY disapointed - this is just plain junk.,You know those cheap plastic toys that you can buy at the Dollar store? This product looks exactly the same. Absolute JUNK. Don't talk yourself into thinking you may luck out-- you won't. When you look at all the unfavorable reviews for this product I am surprised that Amazon allows this vendor to function on Amazon. Totally useless. I just threw it in the trash. You will too.
3,Inoperable,"Only one microphone works. With new batteries installed, both microphone's lights go on. The working microphone's light is red, and the non-working microphone's light is green. I dont see where I can call or email someone with this problem. But I want to know if you test your products before shipping? Also, is it worth complaining?"
1,The Worst Ever,This arrived and has a warning on the side that touching the wires can cause cancer and is banned in California. How can we be selling products like this? The manual is loaded with errors and written in such poor English that it is pathetic.
2,This is only OK.,"For the money, this is not a bad product. But, there is alot of hissing sound which doesnt really allow for clear vocal quality. I dont really use them. I use the wired microphones because of the sound problem."
1,"Unable to use for meeting, not what we expected.","The description is misleading. This can't be used as a stand alone type of microphone for meetings indoors, nor outdoor gatherings. There is nothing to attach it to, and no indication in the description that another machine is needed. It's a waste of money to return it, shipping, handling charges, and the restocking fee offset the cost of the unit. Glad it did not cost any more than it did. I was very disappointed. Amazon usually checks its vendors merchandising a little closer. I was also disappointed that Amazon carried such a cheap,'buyer beware' type of article. Shame on Amazon, shame on me, I could have purchased a dress on sale."
2,Buzz Buzz Buzz,I bought this item because I appreciated the price. First thing you should know is that its so cheap that even the plug isn't the same as is standard in the US. Both prongs are the same size and it won't stay in the outlet.There is also a buzz that seems to come and go and it's really annoying.This item is going back!
1,I wish there was a lower than 1 star rating,"You can expect this item to be cheap just by looking at the price, but I think the quality drops lower than the price. Sounds like you are mumbling when unsing. Anoying hiss. I think the planets need to be aligned in certain order for the red mic to work since it turns on at random times (not like I care if they work anymore since I find the box they came in more usable than the actual mics). In a few words, NOT recomended! Not even for a paper weight."
4,It Works Well! I am glad I didnt get turned off by the bad reviews,I am very satisfied with this item and am quite surprised how loud and clear the voice quality is. This is great value and good performance. The only negative is that the instruction manual is weak and hard to understand because....I am guessing..that is was translated from one language (Chinese) to English. It comes across as vague and confusing. I figured it out quickly and was up and running shortly after deciphering the manual.Excellent product when considering the price paid!
3,hi,"When i read other reviews on this product after I paid for it, I was extremeley nervous. After I recieved it, I got exactly what I paid for. They are perfect for what I am using them for. I plug the receiver and my Ibenez into my Line 6, mix it, and it works great. If you want tour quality mics, SPEND MORE MONEY. These work great in the garage for practice. One day I will be able to afford better quality. Until then, these are great!!"
1,THIS IS A PIECE OF CRAP,I SHOULD HAVE NOT BEEN CHEAP. FIRST OFF WHEN I PUT A BATTERY IN THE RED ONE IS STARTED SMOKING AND NOW DON'T WORK. THE ONLY ONE THAT DOES WORK IS THE GREEN ONE AND THAT WILL NOT LET YOU GET MORE THAN 20 FEET AWAY. I AM SURELY GOING TO TRY TO RETURN THIS AS SOON AS THE HOLIDAY IS OVER.
3,Refund money and do not need return itmes. Okay,"Since this company called me send new product kit. I am accept. Very fast received other one. The product sane problem not working on my notebook. Now refund money for me and keep the products kits(2).I am okay refund.but I need working products. No any comment, because they could not change other high price and good products for me try connect my notebook. We do not know the product problem. Or my notebook problem.I recommend very very careful check detail, make sure no need buy extra equipment connect."
4,A look at where David Bowie's lyrical brilliance came from,"David Bowie was 19 when this album was released, and it is proof of the origination of his unearthly writing genius. Released in 1967, it's sound has it's own light oddness, but it's distinctly mid-1960's London. However, the album's sounds are extremely contradictory to the subject matter; The incongruities of suburban London. The track ""Please Mr. Gravedigger"", is the story of a gravedigger with an unhealthy fetish. It's subjects that lie within remain to be explored by the listener. From polotics to things that seem to be plainly silly, but deserve the most inquiry."
4,Wish I'd bought Deram Anthology instead,"Even though I like this album, because it's a cool but too brief look at Bowie circa 1967,I wish I'd bought ""Deram Anthology"" which has more tracks,back in 1998. Sadly,this CD on the budget Rebound label was several dollars cheaper & I was just too cheap to spend a couple extra bucks though I was fully employed at the time. I love the early melodies & witty songs (I also like the sound quality) of Bowie & this CD just makes me want more of his Deram label material! I'm not even sure ""Deram Anthology"" is still in print since lots of great CD's from the 90's are out of print. I guess that's what I get for being a cheapskate!"
5,Works great.,"I'm not using it with a pc setup. It's currently setup with my home theatre system. a 50'' plasma at about 470watts along with a dvd-r, cable box, xbox360, and a 400watt 5.1 surround system. It backs up everything for over 10 minutes. I've experienced many power surges since its installation due to electrical work being done in my house, and it has kicked in seamlessly everytime. This is a definite go!"
1,Amazon Should Remove This,I order a lot from Amazon and am usually very pleased with their products. I am disappointed and surprised that Amazon would offer this at all. It is a 42-minute cartoon of poor quality. My grand kids stopped watching it after a couple of minutes. A waste of money.
1,Worst Kids Movie So Far,The title of my review says it all. It is clearly designed to deceive people who might think this is Disney. Beware.
5,windy wu - homecoming warrior.,If i could I would raite this movie as 10. It is very funny and allso intertaing.I cantn't stop watching it.brenda did a exlent jobe of acting. I deferenly like the part win wendy wu was beeting up on the teacher.
3,An OK DVD,The first 20-minute video I like very much; the 30 minute walk video froze after 5 minutes and did not play further. The rest of the videos are ok.
5,Excellent for beginners!!!,"This video by Leslie is absolutely excellent for those beginning an exercise regimen! The One-Mile walk alone is a perfect set to do when you find you just don't have time each day to commit an hour or two at a gym. It takes all of two minutes! And guess what? If you don't have those fancy hand weights that Leslie uses - you can substitute canned soup to start with, and build up to using peanut butter jars (creative!).You will break a sweat during the one-mile - not pouring down the back/socks dripping wet type - but a good forehead sweat! Perfect!As you get accustomed to the one-mile then finish the whole video each set. Take your time, gradually adding segments!I love how she shows you how to do the less-impact exercises while walking. For instance, if you can't stretch your arms all the way out like you are flying, no worries, she will (along with her 'helper') show you how to do smaller, yet just as impacting exercises!DEFINITELY recommend this to most everyone!"
3,"Great workouts, horrible picture quality...","As stated in the title, this dvd has a good variety of workouts. We own a couple of her dvds and this one is a nice change. However, the quality of the picture is just horrible. Especially noticeable if you are viewing on a larger HD screen. It was cheap but come on...."
1,"Do NOT buy this if you liked ""O Brother Where Art Thou""","I completely agree with reviewer Nancy L and only wish I had read her review before wasting my money. I never listened to bluegrass before, and bought this CD because I love the soundtrack to ""O Brother Where Art Thou"". What a disappointment. All of the songs on ""O Sister"" sound like the same women and the same banjo on every track. If you are looking at this CD because you liked the music on ""O Brother"", look elsewhere!"
3,Not for foragers,"If you want a few fancy recipes, or are new to sea greens, then this is the book for you. The author is very experienced at using sea veggies to spice up a meal. However, except for a couple of salads, I did not see a recipe where sea veggies were the main ingredient. If you want to forage your own then don't get this book. Not only does the book not tell you how to pick them, it discourages you from doing so."
3,beautiful detail but falls apart easily,"I bought this toy for my two youngest kids (age 2 and 5). They are both Shrek fans. They haven't used it as a memory game as yet. They just play with the adorable little plastic figures. The little figures are about an inch high and are beautifully detailed. beware, however, that they snap easily off their bases, and some of them come apart in the middle pretty easily. We glued them back together, but it makes it rather dangerous for my 2 year old who still likes to put things in her mouth occasionally."
3,looks cool,"It looks cool,i like the idea of how they add pistols onto the main gun.I dont own it but it seems like an ok gun to me.The tank on all of the guns seem a bit small though."
3,A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS....,"This is a nice pictorial history of Mount Everest with accompanying text. While the text is not wholly factually accurate, it does give one a feeling of the tumultuous history surrounding Mount Everest, ever since modern man attempted to scale its heights.The ninety photographs will delight Everest junkies everywhere. Those of Mount Everest, in particular, are spectacular, and alone are worth the price of the book. The photographs, however, are not only of Everest, but are also of those mountaineers who braved the elements to try and unravel its mystery. It is a lovely book which has a place in the library of anyone who is a true Everest aficionado."
3,Not worth the money,"I am a huge La Mer fan, their products really work wonders, but their lip balm does not meet the cut. This lip balm did not keep my lips hydrated, I was thinking for the money it would have done something my Kiehls' #1 did not, I was wrong, was like every other lip balm that I have ever tried. Oh well, back to the Kiehls counter!"
4,PS2 Game,This is the first Prince of Persia that I have played or ever seen. I bought this for my son He loves the Prince of Persia games. He has played a few of them including one on the PS3 but he hadnt played this. Anyway he really likes it and hasnt complained.
1,EXTREME DISAPPOINTMENT,"This is a miserable sequel to the other PoP games. If the earlier games were worse than this one, then they must have been pixelish boring games. The GRAPHICS are ATROCIOUSLY BAD... When i started, the fire was one massive orange pixel. The cinematics are very visible pixels. And the PoP is a monkey. His arms are very long; down to his legs. I would think after a few games, they would be able to make him the right proportion.If the graphics aren't a factor to you, then the gameplay might repel you. The gameplay is a miserable, worthless thing. It is all puzzles. If you like that, well have fun with Prince of Big Pixels."
4,Pretty cool,"This cd has some cool songs on it. It's really ubeat, so if you like music that has a mixture of rhythms and stuff, you should check this out. I like it a lot."
4,"Andres, el cuerdo","Este album, asi como todos los albums de Los Rodriguez, y los otros solistas de Calamaro tambien, valen la pena ser escuchados. Calamaro tiene un estilo que es muy particular y, en mi opinion, es un artista muy bueno."
2,A mess!,I loved Rebelde when it came out on TV here. I have been waiting a long time for the 1st season to come out with english subtitles. However I would not have purchased it if i had known it wasn't complete. They cut off so many scenes it realyl doens't make any sense. On each disk the scenes run together (not like a TV show DVD usually works). I wish I could get my money back and wait for a better version. i would have paid more for a complete season than 20 bucks on this piece of junk. Save your money and wait.
4,my daughter loves this movie,"I got the movie fast and it made a great christmas gift. Also, it was in great condition."
3,Cool,"This DVD is really good, but it didn't work on my DVD player! It would freeze up and be this green color. I decided to tried it on my portible DVD player, and it finally worked. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because it didn't work at first. The shows and the special features were good, though. But don't think that you should buy this movie. I think that it is just mine that didn't work. If you love Hannah Montana like me, then you should buy it."
1,not worth it,"the music was so slow paced,there is no way you can use this cd for a cardio workout. not worth a penny."
3,A classic Christmas,"A Double Holiday Dose of Hazel is just one more video cassette released from a cllassic television show. Hazel,protrayed by Shirley Booth, is the lovable but sometimes meddlesome housekeeper for the Baxters. In the two episodes contained on this video - Christmas makes for laughs.Just 86 shopping minutes Left Till Christmas is an amusing story of Hazel wanting to purchase a gift for Mrs.Baxter when her husband George decides against giving gifts or anything to do with Christmas.Buying Mrs. Baxter a Christmas gift also plays a role in the second episode. Hazel's Shopping List is also a charming and funny tale of Hazel moonlighting to bu her ""Missy"" a beautiful vanity set. Although at times even the viewer will become annoyed at Hazel's behavior laughs are always present. However, the real star of this show is the store's shoplifter.If you are looking for a screwball comedy and out-of-this world antics like I Love Lucy, Pease buy this tape."
1,Dell doesn't care about you or your data.,"I bought one of the Dell Handhelds and found that the SD slot did not work after buying three cards to try. I ended up calling Dell Support to help troubleshoot my problem and they told me to perform a ""hard boot"". They failed to tell me that this would wipe all my data on the device and I lost two days worth of information on it. When I found that this was the case and the representative didn't mention that it would wipe it all, I was very frustrated. Worst of all, it didn't fix the problem. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was informed that they didn't have one because ""they've all gone home"". As a result, it's been sent back and I'm very happy with my iPaq--and its support. Buy a Compaq, they know that data is important and my calls to support don't get treated as a casualty of doing business."
5,"Every bit as good as ""Mob""! Great summer reading.","There are fifteen selections in this book, the only fiction piece being the scene from Godfather II in which Vito Corleone rises to power. There are a couple selections from more scholarly works on the rise and workings of organized crime in Italy and America, a couple of ""I was there"" memoirs and some great reporting on recent figures like John Gotti. But also some very interesting work on a town in Ohio where the town fathers are hand in glove with OC, an interesting piece on NYC Chinatown tongs and on the Bulger brothers of Massachusetts - one a state senate leader, the other a mobster - particularly relevant now (July 2003) because they are back in the news with the wanted mobster gone missing. Every selection is interesting and closed-ended enough that you can enjoy it. Six are stand-alone articles. If you enjoyed ""Mob"" you'll enjoy this, and vice versa. Great light summertime reading."
1,Terrible Packaging,"I ordered this item for christmas. It was damaged upon delivery (both ends broken from the center column). I assumed it was due to UPS mishandling the item but after I reordered a second one and it also came damaged, I realized it was due to insufficient padding and support for the product. So, after 2 failed attempts, I'm getting a refund and I'll look elsewhere for this item."
1,"Don't bother! Looks great, but won't last!","I searched all over for a reasonably priced pedestal for my gazing globe. THe first one I ordered arrived broken. Amazon was great, they replaced it quickly. Now the second on broke. And it broke before the hurricane, not in it. We were putting it away in the shed... my husband carried it to the shed, and put it on the ground so he could open the door. The base cracked open when he put it on the ground. The resin is very thin and now that's 2 in a row--and I've had it only 3 and a half months. Go for a concrete one! I am!"
2,Great back in the day,"I used to use Cleaner all the time. It was once the best encoding product out there. I don't know why Autodesk abandoned it (well, other than money). I would love to still use it but it is now hopelessly out of date and as such woefully overpriced.A great shame as I don't like the Compressor interface - but it gets the jobs done.A"
2,As usual.....high in salt and low in asparagus!,This is a very tasty soup.......but it is still very high in salt and it's mostly just a slightly flavored liquid cream with a very small amount of asparagus...just enough to make it's name legitimate. It's good to use as an additive to casseroles since it's mostly liquid cream and will add a nice flavor to noodles or rice when it's absorbed. I find the 'low vegetable content' to be true of almost all the Baxter soups. They are tasty but I don't think they are really worth their high price!
4,Learn by example,"If you have never wrote your resume (vitae), this book offers you a lot of examples that would give you an idea of what format and contents are good for your case. The ""theory"" is shown in a few pages. Just to tell you what you should write and avoid, including a list of verbs to help you writing.There are also some examples of cover letters that I found useful. They show you the style, length and other features of these documents.You would think that four stars may be too high if you have read other books on this subject, but I took only this book and it was enough for me: I was called for an interview. I am not giving five stars because I have not compared the book with any other."
2,All resumes no how to,"This book is basically all sample resumes, which I don't find very helpful. It is probably better to tell someone how to write a good resume than give them a bunch of examples and tell them to copy them. So if you just want examples and about 7 pages of writing go for it otherwise, not worth it."
5,"""Hostiles spotted Captain""","This truly is an awesome game. I was a big fan of the series for the original X Box, but this game takes things to the next level and beyond. The graphics are amazing while the gameplay is well thought out and smooth. I also have Rainbow 6 Las Vegas and think GRAW is a much better game. If I had to have a gripe about the game it would be that during the later levels your health depletes quickly. It seems like you take only on or two hits and you die. It would be nice to be able to heal yourself the way you can heal your team mates. Or have more ammo boxes available to heal. Other than that I can't wait for GRAW 2 in March."
2,"Nice Shoes, TERRIBLE service from Macy's","The shoes r nice,as expected from Skechers. Macy's service was TERRIBLE: I never got a way to track the shipment after the order was accepted; weeks later when I emailed them to ask, they had the nerve to ask me what the order was! I asked for refund, and they didn't know what to do with my request. Never will buy from Macys again, n would recommend to avoid this seller to everyone."
3,all they needed was some great songs,"of course that's the rub for many good local bands. the wipers were (are?) a very good local band but i had never heard of them before amazon .the reason for that is there are no great songs on this box set. they play great, sound great but nothing is memorable (except maybe the overall guitar driven sound). comparisons to the velvet underground, love or big star are absurd because all those bands had many all time great songs. and that's the main difference between all time greats and very good local bands. great songs. it's what's lacking on this box set. 3 and 1/2 stars."
5,"go ""over the edge"" with punk classics","If you like punk music or culture at all you MUST LISTEN TO THIS. they helped to save the Northwest for the punks and indie kids, if you are punk and indie check em' out NOW! Sage has a very unique guitar style, easily recognized - danceable angst flanged rhythms of doom hammerin' over yr head!! yah, this box set IS worth it, it's actually worth it, go ahead and buy it all three records are PURE PUNK"
3,it's fast and can be fun,"This game is a throwback to old school fast shooters that can be fun but quite frankly does not hold up to other multiplayer games such as modern warfare, Halo Reach etc. If you have been gaming for more than 10 years and want something that reminds you of days of yore than this is it for you. However if you can not remember a time before killstreaks than this is probably not for you."
2,BORING,This game is too linear and there are no options to explore. You have to follow the path that the game allows you to take with all the creativity and problem solving removed from the game play. I definitely do not recommend this game.
1,Yep... great at first,"It worked flawlessly for just about a year, maybe 2-3 times a month, then just quit holding temperature."
2,Cheap,"Very cheap quality. You get what you pay for. I'm using them for practice for school, so it's ok for me, but I wouldn't want to rely on them for motor building!! The one I recieved was not the same one as pictured. Very hard to read markings as they are not colored, just engraved in chrome. Easy to adjust 0 point. Not expexting them to be accurate at all though."
5,Another good read,"Reading this book now, you have an insight into just how much damage a country can do to itself for so long. 20 years down the line, China is making the same misguided choices it is making today.It gets a little repetitive sometimes, but this is still a good read."
4,An Honest Account of the Situation Then,The author has written as was the real situation then. There was no white-washing of issues about the pain and sufferings of the citizens in China immediately after the communists take-over in 1949. Informative to the extent of being shocking at times.
3,Stamina Pilates Upper Body Workout Series DVD,"This workout by Stamina is a short upper body. It is a little easy but good if you are just learning the reformer. It is good if you need a short workout or are trying to get the upper body in shape, you can add this every day to your regular workout."
1,Home of more dropped calls per minute than any other carrier,"Purchased an iPhone 3GS in June 2009. In about August 2009 Verizon finally allows video and picture messaging on the iPhone.As of August 2009, I drop about 65% of my calls.I suspect their network cannot handle all the voice and data.Kicked AT&T; loose, gladly paying the ETF just to be free of all the dropped calls. Got the Droid X from Amazon for a penny. Only one dropped call in about 45 days with Verizon.Guess we know who has the better network...."
3,so so,if you really like Sherlock Holmes get the Jeremy Brett series - you will love it and will be entertained better than with Rathbone SERIOUSLY
1,Compatible with Force Feedback Pro Joystick,Unfortunately I could not get this adapter to work with my Microsoft Force Feedback Pro Joystick. My computer does not have a game port as it has built in audio....only USB ports. This Adapter may work with some other joysticks but I could not get the computer to recognize it no matter what I did. I am using Windows XP w/SP2. I took a Creative Labs sound card out of a slightly older computer and installed it. Windows XP recognized it immediately now I can use the joystick.
5,Great solution to the pet hair problem!,"We own a Himalayan, and our vaccum cleaner was no match for the long cat hair deep in our carpet. We purchased the Rug Rake on a whim, and it has worked wonderfully.I agree with another reviewer who mentioned that the design doesn't maximize contact with the carpet, but the rake still picks up a ton of hair and is quite effective."
2,Hard to Use,"I was so excited to try this out. I could only get it to work if I pulled it towards me. It got some hair, but not enough to make it worth it. I have a Shar Pei/Lab mix and he is constantly shedding. His hair is like pine needles and works its way into the carpets. We bought a Dyson Animal and it helps a bit, but it can't get all the deep down hairs. I hoped this rake would help, but it isn't worth the time/ money."
1,Plastic lining tore despite lowest dryer setting.,"Although we used the lowest dryer settings, the plastic lining developed tears in various places on the first run. The weight of the lining is surprisingly light, and it's exposed to damage on the bottom of the pad.By comparison, theCarter's Keep Me Dry Waterproof Fitted Quilted Crib Pad, Whitehas the waterproof lining sandwiched between layers of fabric. We have not experienced any leaks with the Carter's brand despite constant wash/dry cycles."
4,Very good quality,"When I received this mattress pad, it was packaged very nicely in a little bag like a quilt. The quality of the pad was very good for the price, and the plastic backing seems to be durable as well. I washed it in the washer on ""delicate"" and dried in the dryer under ""delicate"" as well, as I read other reviews that it rips/tears when washed and dried, but I did not have those problems. I would highly recommend this product."
2,Cheap thin plastic on underside,This is the third mattress cover I have purchase - all three have been different brands. This one by far is the cheapest one quality wise for the backside plastic. It is thin and ripped and left holes in the plastic AFTER ONLY ONE WASH! My other two mattress covers are almost two years old and have NO RIPS after multiple washes. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Stick with a Carters brand or Especially for Baby brand.
4,"Quite good, actually","Normally I don't like the books in the Teach Yourself series, since they're much to often based on artficial forms of the language in question and aren't that user-friendly. This book is one of the best, though. It presents a very neat presentation of Welsh, explaining most forms of grammar and giving a decent vocabulary. I do recommend it, but want to point out that Colloquial Welsh by Gareth King is an even better and more complete introduction to Welsh"
4,Bib for young babies,Very nice bib for young babies. Not too big at the neck. Could be a little longer.
5,The Prostate: A Guide for Men and the Women whoLove Them,"I was given this book prior to prostate surgery and it's now the only source of information to which I refer friends when asked about my experience with prostate cancer. It is well written, easy for the layman to understand, and very thoughtfully spells out the available options a prostate cancer patient faces. My wife also read the book, and it gave her a sense of understanding of my problem which she'd not had. Thanks Dr. Walsh."
4,Cuts like a dream !!!,"We were replacing an ancient set of steak knives with this set. We LOVE the weight of them and the style. They cut like a dream! However, I was a little disappointed in that the wood on the handles isn't very nicely finished. It is sanded, but almost like a rough finish. We had some fine grain sandpaper for finishing and wood conditioner for our wood block so we used some of this on the handles after sanding them down a bit more, and are pretty happy with the results. We will have to recondition the handles again, but given that they are wood it's to be expected at some point. I think they will last us many years! Overall I'm very pleased with them, but I wish the wood would have been finished prior to our receiving them."
2,Kong is destructive! He destroyed GBA SP,This game is boring! YAWN! As soon as I wake up I will tell you how bad it sucks!!!!
3,"Warning: Not truly ""leather bound""!","From WotC's description, the Special Editions are ""premium black bonded leather"". ""Bonded leather"" is a manmade compound; it is essentially leather fibers plus latex. This is far from the quality of a true leather-bound book (which would use real leather). As one bookbinder puts it: ""recommended for use only if the book will be used infrequently."""
4,my search is ended,"this contains the definitive version of ""ojitos bellos"" i think. i'm buying for this song alone if i can't find grupomania. at 4.98 used one can't go wrong. find some dominicans to dance with and you are rocking."
1,DO NOT BUY this¬°¬°¬°¬°¬°¬°¬°,"Creative Doesn't has soport for win 2000, so you won't be able to play dvds with is so called DVD Decoder, # years later they haven't relesed the win2000 driver, and i'm sure they aren't ever going to."
5,Life Changing Book,I've read this book and I guarantee you are gonna love this book. Not only is this book good it is so good and will change your life. It teaches you how to change your handwriting so that your whole life changes. If you are shy and scared by criticism and you read this book and you follow it day by day you're going to be more open and not afraid. Or if you're stubborn this book will tell u how to change it. This book is a book for succes. Forget about those stupid infommercials that teach you how to be rich. If you want something that really works and will change your life forever buy this book. This is the best book I've ever read and I definetely recommend it for everyone.
5,We love dogs at our house and Clifford is fun to read about.,"My grandson wanted to read this one several times, as he loves dogs and she really had fun at Christmas this year."
3,State Dept. has a sense of humor,These anecdotes and recipes are charming and bring back memories of our time spent in Nigeria.I enjoy recipes with a tropical twist so I plan to try some of these.
5,Rating the APC BE350R Back ups,"They use these back ups where I work and have 100's of PC, so I figured they must be the best because the one hooked up to my work PC has never failed me in the six years I've worked for the company.Ralph Speer"
1,A sad disappointment from APC,"The unit I received must have been defective. After it had been online for a few hours, it shut down, emitted continuous beeping, and didn't power anything. Reset it, it ran a few more hours, same problem. Other APC units of different models here worked worked fine and did not have any power issues. I returned the unit and will look for a better one."
3,"Not a bad UPS, depending on your needs","APC, generally, makes very good quality UPS's. This is an entry-level UPS, so do not expect more than a couple minutes of runtime if you have a computer plugged in to it. (This was purchased to provide backup to a cordless phone base station. In this application, the UPS provides 90+ minutes of runtime.)One thing to keep in mind is that only 4 of the 8 plugs are UPS protected. All 8 plugs provide conditioned power.A nice feature is that one of the outlets is offset from the others. That way you can plug in an AC transformer without it covering half of the neighboring plugs."
2,Way underpowered,"I bought this as a backup for my media computer, which is a Small Form Factor Shuttle machine with only a 200W power supply. That computer is the only thing plugged in to the battery ports of the UPS (no monitor) and it still only gives me less than 2 minutes of backup. This isn't even enough time for Windows to shut down half the time! I will be purchasing a larger unit like I should have in the first place, and downgrading this one to use with my router and cable modem."
3,Two years doesn't seem long enough,"I had one for about two years. After a power outage of about 90 minutes, it ran down, lasting about 40 minutes, powering only my cable modem and router. A few weeks later, I could hear the relay inside clicking on and off, over and over. I don't know if that's bad, but it certainly can't be good when there is no brown-out condition. Had to take it out of service.I suppose it worked well enough for two years, but I just figured it would last longer for what was, at the time, fifty bucks."
2,Uninspired book,"This book was poorly organized and careless thrown together without guard to accuracy. Although many of his observations are true, the observations are neither unique nor especially well written. The book seemed careless thrown together. For example on page 45 he states ""talent is never mentioned"" (in proverbs). I remember my parents reading to me Proverbs 22:29 as a young child. ""Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will serve before kings; he will not serve before obscure men."" Never is a strong word and should only be used carefully. The inaccuracy and careless of this sentence is representative of the whole book."
5,Storytelling at its best,"I read this book when it came out in the '70s and it had quite an impact on me. It's beautifully written and the story is unforgettable. I have bought used copies for my younger friends through the years, as it's no longer in print. It's a classic for the ages."
4,Beethoven and Billy Joel?,"I haven't been able to hear the ""audible noises"" that the texan reviewer (Ms. Redundancy) seemed so distracted by. The score is great for all the obvious reasons.I am curious as to whether anyone else unfortunate enough to be familiar with the Billy Joel song (circa 1985) ""This Night"" from the ""Innocent Man"" album has noticed that it is a direct and complete rip-off of the Pathetique piece repeated at tracks 1 and 12. Its ridiculous, but it's really plagueing me--I can't listen to it without noticing it."
4,I Wish I could too!,"One January day kid from Wisconsin, named Judson Moon becomes the youngest president in America. The Kid Who Became President is a book tells about a thirteen year old boy that is sworn in as president and what happens during his years as president and what happens. Will all go as planned? Or will every thing go wrong? In my opinion is that I loved the book. It made me want to read more! It also made me think, laugh, and learn. The book makes you feel like you are watching Judson Moon! The book tells how hard it is to be president and what you have to do. I recommend the book to everyone over nine, boys and girls. I even recommend the book to adults. In the book you get surprises, good news, bad news, and a recommendation from me. I gave the book four in a half stars because I loved it and I wish there is a sequel. I did a book review on this book because I want to share the book with you!"
5,The Kid Who Became president,I love this book. I read it agin and agin. I am only 11 years old and i have decided to run in 2004 for president of the usa
1,poor product,Worked for about twenty minutes was really under powered did not even feel like requesting a refund just not satisfied at all.
4,Great sound by great price!,"I was looking for a pair of tweeters which offers me the rare combination between price and quality, and that was exactly what I got. I'm very satisfied with this product. The only con could be their aspect (not very good looking), but are not horrible."
3,An okay movie,"First, this movie is not directed by Ernesto D'Alessio nor does he appear in any part of it. Amazon is in the process of verifying these facts. For a latino movie of this kind I thought it was average. I liked the plot but the story didn't flow very consistently nor did it really make you feel for any of the characters."
3,Nice mellow prog.,"Gordon Giltrap is a fine acoustic 12 string slinger,in the vein of Anthony Phillips, and 12 string electric guitar..On this album, his first venturing in to the prog world with electric instruments.We get a fine balance of Anthony Phillips acoustics,the classical rock style like Sky and Alan Parsons orchestrations (toned down mind you).It is all instrumental and a very nice flowing album.Giltrap on this album gets help from Simon Phillips on drums,Rod Edwards on keys and John G. Perry on bass.3 very big stars."
3,Wish I Hadn't Bought It,"The major categories in this book are Supplies, Color, Surface Design, Transferring Images, Embellishments, Decorating the Home, Quilts, Wearables, and Celebration Banners. To me, the painted fabric is unattractive, sometimes downright ugly. On page 26 is a photo of a piece called ""Rapture and Tea"", which I don't see why the author included in her book. By contrast, photo H on page 38 is, to my taste, more attractive, as are some others in the remainder of that chapter.The transfer methods dealt with are Carbon (not what you might think), Acrylic Medium, Light Box, Permanent Pens, and Fabric Marking Pens. The embellishments shown in the section of the same name, are pedestrian at best, as are the items shown in Decorating the Home. Except for the front cover quilt, the painted quilts are OK. The wearables were probably more acceptable in 1997 when the book was published. Patterns, which have to be enlarged to workable size, are provided on crosshatch paper."
1,Title Should Be: Not Enough Material for a Book,"Relatively thin information on Peter Lawford is padded out by Ted Schwarz with generally known histories of people and events related to Lawford. So you learn a bit about HUAC and the blacklist, too much about Louis B. Mayer's background and romantic aspirations, far too much about Joseph Kennnedy's ditto, and WAY too much about how President John Kennedy acted in bed. The things that you might want to learn about, such as Marilyn Monroe, and the Rat Pack are passed over lightly.What there is about Peter Lawford is sprinkled in between these diverse page-fillers and the whole is seasoned with opinions often are not backed up.Too bad that Schwarz didn't put some effort into researching Lawford, the supposed subject of this book. Instead he seemed to have churned it out for the sake of adding another publication to his massive list. This book makes me wonder if they are all as poor a job as this one."
1,Not as good as it looks,I am very disappointed in this product and should have returned it. It is much more bulky than it appears however the worst part was trying to adjust the band. The metal pins are very difficult to remove and even more difficult to reincert. The band is very poor quality. I bought the watch so that when I travel I would have correct time in different time zones with a watch that wasn't expensive but still looked good. This is a very cheap version of what I expected.
2,meh,"The watch is very ugly, and the satellite was not very consistent. It would keep going in and out of signal and sometimes changing the time to an incorrect time. Not worth it!"
4,A Must read for beginning investors,"This book provided me with so much insight into the real estate market. It gives you a technical step by step approach on how to go about investing. He starts with the very basics and teaches you to build a good network of people that will assist you with any kind of real estate investing. From buying your own home to owning commercial real estate property, this book is a must read!. I highly recommend it! C. Gaines (thegaines@prodigy.net"
1,Dell Doesn't Care About You Or Your Data,"I bought one of the Dell Handhelds and found that the SD slot did not work after buying three cards to try. I ended up calling Dell Support to help troubleshoot my problem and they told me to perform a ""hard boot"". They failed to tell me that this would wipe all my data on the device and I lost two days worth of information on it. When I found that this was the case and the representative didn't mention that it would wipe it all, I was very frustrated. Worst of all, it didn't fix the problem. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was informed that they didn't have one because ""they've all gone home"". As a result, it's been sent back and I'm very happy with my iPaq--and its support. Buy a Compaq, they know that data is important and my calls to support don't get treated as a casualty of doing business."
1,What is this?,"I sometimes remember the day I bought this cd and I listened to for the first time. I had only two questions : How could I have bought this one and how could I forget what I had heart. It was easy, first throwing it away and after listening to guys like Van Morrison, Radiohead, or Pink Floyd, just for allowing the music to start again."
5,Powerful film,"This was a rare glimpse into the world of the Afghanis, the people who are simply viewed as statistics in the war being waged in their country. Finally, we get to see the mindset, culture and overall thinking of these people who are human beings first, and part of a political, military struggle second. Really opened up my eyes and made me feel something for these young, brave people. A fascinating film."
5,birthday gift,the product came as described and in perfect time. This company is a pleasure to do business with. I would highly recommend them and the product to anyone who knows and appreciates quality.
3,NOT MADE IN USA,"IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION YOU CAN READ THAN THE CRAYONS ARE MADE IN MEXICO, BUT WHEN I RECIVIED THEM YOU CAN READ MADE IN MEXICO. ACTUALLY THEY ARE PRETTY SOFT LIKE I SPECTED BUT THEY ARE NOT AS DESCRIBED."
5,A source of guidance and strength.,"I found ""The Woman's Book of Spirit"" when I was very needy. The readings and meditations have been a source of help for me. I'm on my second reading and frequently go back to certain high-lighted parts. May Sue continue to inspire and encourage us to listen to our souls and follow our intuitions tn order to cope with life and be all that we can be."
5,great for workout recovery,"I take two of these in the morning and two after I workout at night and they greatly help reduce the muscle soreness, I took just 2 after working out and noticed slightly more soreness, then stopped taking them and immediately noticed a increase in soreness."
4,Eh...,"Noticed nothing, but who knows. Probably won't be getting this again. I do like Now Brand Probiotic though. I took this to help out in the gym."
3,"Excellent Quality screen. But, only ONE in the package","(deserves 5 star for quality).Quality is really good. Perhaps even better than bare PDA screen. I could write better with this screen protector than PDA screen without any screen protector. Perhaps, this is very durable and may last for a long time, but I do not know how long it will because I used it only for few days. CAUTION!!!: The $13 package only contains 1, (store usually sells by dozen). So, if you make mistake when you apply it to your PDA, you have to pay for another."
1,Do not buy regret purchase recycled item do not work well,"Product did not work return product under issued RMA no credit issued back still waiting, this seem to be a not an honorable vendor"
1,Horrible Game,I rented this game from Blockbuster and was so bored with it I returned it the same day. The gameplay was horrible and each event was thought out and designed very poorly. I would be emberassed if I were part of the design team that published this terrible game for such a great system. Do not buy this game without first renting it.
2,Only a Teaser,"This book is a nice introduction to Pontormo's work, but not that satisfactory. His best paintings and drawings are brilliant, and one suspects that the publishers could have included more reproductions of his finer works. Many of the paintings in here are mediocre/ deteriorated/ or plainly less accomplished. The book is from a series on Italian masterpieces, and is limited to a standard number of pages."
3,Thirty bucks?,"Parappa 2 is a lot of fun to play. If you are familiar with the style nothing will surprise you, it is essentially the same as the first version where you press the various controller buttons in time with the beat. However, paying thirty dollars for this game seems like a waste.There are only 8 levels, so finishing the game takes only a couple hours. Even for a complete beginner like me, the gameplay was too easy and quick. I was flipping burgers on day one and rapping with De La Soul on day two, that's not making the most of my gaming money.Also, several of the levels didn't seem to have much to do with the Noodle Syndicate plotline. The boot camp and hair salon sequences felt out of place in a story about noodles taking over the world.All in all, this game offers a few good laughs and a few finger flipping challenges, but not enough to pay full price. A used disc would offer as much without the guilt of having paid too much for too little."
3,"Not as good as Um Jammer Lammy,but still cool","I love this game but there's one problem......TOO EASY!!!!!!I mean,it is soooooooo easy that there's almost no point to even buy this game.Sorry SCEA,but next time,Think Money!Oh Yeah,And another thing next time make a Um Jammer Lammy 2."
5,Alejandro es incre√≠ble,"MAS es uno de los pocos CD's donde todas las canciones son excelentes (en realidad una es mejor que la otra). Alejandro es uno de los pocos artistas que compone de esa manera tan asombrosa, realmente es admirable. Soy fan de √©l y este CD demuestra su crecimiento como artista. Creo que ser√° dif√≠cil para √©l mismo superar un trabajo de esta naturaleza. Alejandro felicitaciones!!!!"
5,"Nadie como t√∫, Alex","No hay persona mas tierna,romantica y sensual a la vez como t√∫ Alex, y esque es a travez de tus canciones como puedo darme cuenta de ello. t√∫ y ""M√°s"", son lo MAXIMO!"
3,ok book,This book wasn't what I thought it would be but it has great art work and a nice fall story.
3,Big Book of Intro French,"This is pretty good. Hippocrene has a couple dozen ""beginning language"" books, this is the only one that is 400+ pages though! It's thorough, it's no nonsense, the author dives right in. I think most people would find this a little off putting as a very first book, but if you know another romance language or some part-remembered french and you like a more grammatical approach....then, you may like this and it is inexpensive for the volume of training and practice you get. but she dives right in, for example, the word ""for"" and ""pour"" usually translate, except never use ""pour"" for time (for six weeks, for a year): ok, this book tells you that in the first few pages!!! On the other hand, it's a pretty good fact to know and easier to remember when told point blank."
1,An Inspiring and Instructive Book,"I can add little to the outstanding reviews of this book that others have written. In retirement, I read 50-100 books annually and would rank this book as being among the top 1-2 percent of books that I have read. Pointedly, without my reference to any particular denomination of set of beliefs, this book increased my understanding of what I think life should be about. Forty years of my life was spent working in the medical-industrial complex. I wish that all of those employed in healthcare could read this outstanding work. Maybe we could come to appreciate that caring for those who suffer is more important than short-term return on investments."
3,GOOD TOSCHES BUT NOT GREAT TOSCHES !,"I am a fan fanatic when it comes to the work of Nick Tosches , and having read ""In the Hand of Dante ', and then ""Where Dead Voices Gather"" , I am convinced Tosches is a genius. I am still in the process of buying up all that he has written. Having lit the candles and incense at the Tosches altar , I must admit that after reading ""King of the Jews"" in two days I was disappointed. This time he was not able to spin the magic as he did in ""Trinities"" and ""Cut Numbers"" , which I consider his masterpieces to date. I will still buy everything he writes and hope to meet him for dinner at some future date before we get much older."
5,Great resource for parents & teachers,This is a comprehensive book that every parent/teacher of a child with any disability should read! It's a resource that you can refer to over and over! Well worth the money!
4,Not Bad!,"This sweet sauce is just like described, a sweet heat. I really have never had anything like it, and it really goes well with many different foods, I have been using it on wings and grilled chicken but would imagine it even would be very good on sliced white turkey meat, lol. The cool thing is that it is not overbearingly sweet or hot so don't let the fact it has habaneros in it scare you. I usually limit my hot sauce to Louisiana types and this seems less hot to me then they do. I could see this being used wherever you would normally use a glaze. Try it and you will be pleasantly surprised."
4,Nice flavor blend,Mango and ginger make an excellent flavor blend. Fischer & Wieser do a nice job with the sauce. Nice consistency - not to thick or too runny.We did a very nice grilled chicken with it.
4,Not as much kick as expected,"As a marinade I found this to work well, the flavors aren't overpowering and temper well with heat, perhaps a little too much. The ginger flavor is strong although the habanero element is not as spicy as I expected. Its a nice variation on the basic hot sauce and could work well with barbequed chicken."
5,Mango ginger habanero - three of my favorite flavors!,"I like spicy food. I love ginger, and I can never pass up anything that involves mangoes. Obviously, this is right up my alley. It is zippy, but not to the point where you have to blow your nose afterward; tangy, fruity and gingery all through. I tried it with meat, with vegetables, and on a cheese sandwich, and they were all good. I haven't tried it on ice cream yet, but I just might!"
4,Sweet Heat,I have tried several of the Fischer and Wieser sauces and wondered if I would like this one. I am not a big fan of sweet and hot together but this one surprised me. I used it as a marinade and baste for a pork loin and it was wonderful. I served extra as a dipping sauce and got compliments on it. The balance between sweet and spicy was good with a tad bit more emphasis on the sweet. Could compliment a variety of dishes and think I will try it on baked chicken next.
4,"Good, but really sweet!","Mango, sugar, honey apple cider vinegar, ginger, habanero and spices. That's all that's in this product and I must say it tastes great. The only draw back is that it's REALLY sweet. My wife and I have tried it with two different kinds of fish and it was too sweet for both of them. We're gonna finish out the bottle with some pork this week an see if that can hold it's own. There is a good level of ginger and habanero flavor. I might also use this as a dipping sauce for an asian inspired meal"
3,Great on Mahi Mahi,Our Costco sells a frozen Mahi Mahi entree which tastes just like it has Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce on it. I can save myself some money and put the sauce on the fish myself!
4,More heat than sweet,"If you like something that brings the heat when you eat, then you'll love this mango ginger habanero sauce. It's not like Fischer & Wieser's raspberry chipotle that probably rates about a 2 or maybe 3 on the spiciness scale (and it's heat is slow building).The habanero sauce, however, is quite hot, with only a hint of sweetness. I'd say that if Louisiana Hot Sauce or Tabasco sauce rates an 8 or 9 on the spiciness scale, then this Habanero sause rates about a 6. And, the Habanero sauce heat starts right away.I hope this was helpful!"
4,"I Like It, but $5/bottle?","I really like this sauce. It's great with stir fry, egg rolls, as a sandwich spread if you want to kick it up a notch. The Habanero heat gives a good burn, but it won't kill you like those Habanero wings you tried once that left blisters on your tongue.I'm not sure what I would do with 6 bottles of this, or if I would pay $5/bottle. A little of this goes a long way. I've used it several times and still have 2/3 bottle left. If you buy 6 bottles, that's pretty much a lifetime supply unless you cook for the masses."
2,Too Sweet for me!,"Sugar is the second ingrediant listed and you can taste it. I have tried other products that mix the hot and sweet with success. This marinade just did not suit my tastebuds. Now, to be fair-my family loved it. Yet since I was reviewing and I am the only only to shop, I rated it with my viewpoint."
4,This stuff is good!,"It says finishing/dipping sauce. We can add jelly to that title. I'm sure it's a great finishing/dipping sauce..it even tasted good right out of the jar. But, I make up concoctions of things I have in the house to suit my tastebuds at the time, and I decided I wanted toast for my snack 2 nights ago. This finishing sauce was great on my toast. I like really hot things, but not on toast. The sauce was just right. This sauce just has a hint on habanero taste, and the sauce is fairly sweet. This would probably be good poured over cream cheese for an extra treat.Would I recommend it? Yes!"
4,A very good finishing sauce,"When I first saw the word Habanero in the title of this sauce I was expecting my taste buds to be assaulted by the flavor of those little peppers. However, when I actually tried it (brushed over grilled chicken) I was met with a tangy flavor that did not overpower me at all but enhanced the flavor of the chicken.I will readily admit that I am a picky eater and hesitate to try anything new, but after trying this I am glad I did. Now, more seasoned 'adventerous eaters around me tried this as well and also agreed that it had a good mix of flavoring and was not overpowering, nor was it underwhelming either.All in all a solid addition to spice things up over the summer grill."
1,So hard to get through,"I've been assigned this book for English for summer reading, and I still haven't finished it!! I alwyas get distracted becuz It's so boring and I can't keep my mind on it."
1,Fantasy Island,This book is the most boring book that I have ever read and I hope I never have to read it again.
1,Game Lover,"If you love snowboarding, DON'T buy this game. There are no course options, not able to save scores and there are only 3 jumps in a very short course. This game was a HUGE disappointment!"
3,"VERY Poorly packed, staples a mess,but work","These staples must have been dropped in someones warehouse, or run over with a fork lift.They arrived with other air gun nails (those were in fine condition) in a taped Bostich box all broken up. Good thing they work in the air stapler.The overall box shipped to me was barely taped, ten times bigger than it needed to be with the product sloshing around inside.Very shabby. I would never buy ANYTHING expensive and delicate from Amazon. NEVER."
4,Pick this CD Up!,"At first I thought this CD was going to be [bad]. The album cover design is amateurish and probably scares a lot of people away...but for real, you should get this CD. The music really grooves. My favorite tracks are Wake Up by Rex Havoc- the repetition builds and makes you want to dance- and Freak on a Leash by The Bug Funny Foundation- whose sexy voice makes you want to grab someone you know real well and grind. This CD suprised me, and will really suprise you."
4,wow these are great,"So i work in a bike shop, and i was putting these on my bike that i cruise campus on, i got these pedals thinking they would be some supper cheapo pedals to throw on my bike for a while, i love these there is only one thing is they are a bit stiff coming out of the box but they soften up and hold strong. Thses pedals the stock refectors fall off pretty easy but that is the only thing to make these a four not a five"
2,Won't Recharge Perfectly Good Batteries,"My main gripe with this unit is it won't recharge perfectly good batteries that will recharge in other units. Plop the batteries in this unit and you get the flashing red light and they won't recharge. Put them in another type of recharger and they recharge fine. Since this unit is marketed by a battery manufacturer, it kind of makes you wonder if this isn't intentional....."
3,GREAT WITH NEW BATTERIES,"I think it is designed for only relatively new batteries...All the rechargeable batteries I own from a year ago dont get charged on this charger. I have to use my old overnight charger.. However, while the battery is new (so far batteries 6 months old or less), this charger is working perfectlty!! (15 is a true 15 minutes)..I charge half my batteries( the relatively new ones) on this charger, and the others on the older charger..The thing is all my batteries are the same, only how long ive been using them is the only difference.. This is a new way for batteries companies to make you change ur rechargeable batteries sooner! even though the old batteries might still work properly (maybe not in digital camera), but for sure in computer mouse or mp3 player.."
1,Battery Annihilation,Oh the little blinking red light letting me know another battery was unusable. Lost countless batteries (old and new) to this piece of garbage. It looks like I am not alone and many people have experienced this shong i tong. Maybe Energizer should stop making this unit...
4,the only problem with this cd is the title......,"yep... the cd is a perfect example of good deep lounge music. i'm not quite sure where or what he two first reviewers were smoking but the compilation is deep and soulful and wonderful.its only problem is that i think the label wanted to ride the portishead moniker.i actually got it for the dust remix. beautiful acoustic beat music!i usually never respond to a lot of reviews but i had to refute the two earlier ones.i am the biggest massive attack and portishead fan in the world (i know folks would fight me over that) and if you're looking for music like that look elsewhere. but if you're looking for some hed kandi vibe deepness, give it try! if you dont like it. hit me up... i buy it off ya!!!"
1,Trash,"Horrible, absoloutely horrible, you only sell these types of films when your really low on cash. The plot sucks, and theres hardly any fighting in it. Oh yeah, and it's in catonese just like the other so-called, ""kung fu"" films I ordered and only one of them was in english 2.0 stereo/mono. Please for the love of god, let buyers know what language a kung fu film is in."
5,Liked the book but...,"This is a good young adult book, I read it and the rest of the series because my son was asking for them. The whole series is great, but this one implies it is the last of the series, and I want more of the story. I would be quite interesting to continue to explore the relationships between newly reunited family members and how each of these owls that we have become to know so well continue on with their lives, in a new era of a new king."
3,Going Downhill,"Kathryn Lasky is starting to disappoint me. The first five or six books were great, but once they started to bring in Coryn and Nyra? The series started to go downhill. As with most series, if the author starts to write too many books, the writing gets sloppy. What happened to the action of the first book? Why bring in weird characters in weird ways? For instance, the wolfish creatures in the Beyond the Beyond. I'm saddened that Lasky can't make her old characters more interesting! I loved the Band, but now there's only Coryn. Please Kathryn, do something!"
4,a wise woman,"This one really is good. She has a sexy voice, but doesn't use it just to come on to men and alienate women. She speaks from the point of view of a woman who has learned a lot in life and takes responsibility for her own pleasure, which she has in abundance.Not content to wither and sing the blues when her man does her wrong, she instead vows to ""make love to the next man that I see."" In ""I love you. I am no more"" she is a housewife who is so caught up in lovemaking that she ""doesn't know if the kids have eaten,"" an amusing and liberating line for us working mommies who run around feeling like we have to be everything to our kids, jobs and men.Another beautiful line from ""I Love you.I am no more"": ""I think there was some kind of sunset."" That's just one of the many poetic verses in this album."
2,Could have been much better,"After the death of songwriter/composer/singer/guitar player Andr√©s Bobe in 1993, La Ley still had enough creative impulse to make ""Invisible"", but in this later album, ""V√©rtigo"", which was almost entirely done by Beto Cuevas (singer), we find a severe lacking of smooth rithm and lyrics and instead an eclectic not-so-great mix of electronic music and rock. No wonder they changed their style for their next CD ""Uno"". Buy ""Doble Opuesto"" instead of this one."
5,I really like the range og fellings in this cd,I hope everyone can sample at least one cd of these band's work. The diversity that of cultures and feelings. I have enjoy the past cd's and these new one is no eception. The many emotions that I get from this type of music are very profound!
1,The fate of the self-indulgent,"Although Mr. Corngold writes with all the outward flags of intense academic prowess (the rhetoric is spot on), his book is weak in the sense that it hasn't got any really new point to make. Or rather, if a new point is being made....The book refers to all the right things, and yet seems to say nothing. Perhaps the parameters are too general. I find works like these, full of the correct discourse presented in the correct way, but without any insight, tell us more about self-indulgence of the author than about the problematic question of the self in Western discourse."
5,A Blessing,"Being a Walter Hawkins fan from the beginning in the SF Bay Area, I was very excited to learn of his new solo project. From the time I purchased it months ago, it has been a mainstay in my car CD player and I have another for my home. It touches my soul daily. Every song relays the message, ""it's alright, God's right there with you through it all."" After listening to it on my drive in the morning, I feel so inspired, I can take on anything that comes my way. The range is from that soothing melodic that is the Walter Hawkins trademark, to the funky beat that will have you bouncing your head and praising at the same time."
2,Dull,"Construction looks good, but it does not cut well. Bit was very dull compared to other bits. But comperable bits are several times the cost."
4,Pretty good but could be better,This game was very good. The graphics are excellent and the gameplay is good. The big flaw is that there are only six events but all these events are pretty good. I am hoping for more events in Athens 2004.
2,Umm....I thought the Olympics had more than 6 events.,Personaly i think this game had good graphics and was pretty fun....for 4 days! The worst thing about this game is the selection....6 events! ooooooo ill never get them all done! When i rented this game i had an idea that maybe it would be like a good Nagano '98 (witch had extreams amounts of events but each [was bad]) Another problem is the loading. If you do Ski Jump olympic mode you load for about 60 seconds then do the game for 2 min. then load another 60 seconds to get back to the menu. Its not really much fun. Also and last but not least the commintary drags on and on but at least you can shut that off.... i didnt give this 1 star because for what it did have it was pretty good but comeon guys its time to make a good olympic games and stop making these jokes.
3,Little Underwater,My biggest problem was the insufficent ammount of actual underwater footage. I expected some actual dive film on several of the key ships but got none. I didn't buy this to listen to fat natives talk about the attack.
2,Not for me,"I really enjoyed Pamela Clare's contemporary books and on that basis bought three of her books set in the mid-18th century, trusting that I would enjoy them as well. Afraid not. For a start, the ridiculous, purported Scots accents are so distracting that I just ended up annoyed. I could not find much sympathy for Iain and his brothers and did not feel any pull of attraction to him. The over-done analysis of British (e.g. Scottish and English) contemporary politics was a bit puerile and simplistic. I realise that it's popular in American cinema to make the baddies Brits but this was just very thin and unsupported, IMO. Frankly the heroine just did not fit in the timeframe and again the background she was given seemed pretty one dimensional to me. This just wasn't for me. I am sorry that this book was such a disappointment but there were too many jarring, inaccurate and overdrawn themes in the story and characters about whom, frankly, I did not give a damn."
5,Amazing!,Couldn't stop reading SURRENDER! The characters jump off the page and into your heart. Pamela Clare is a brilliant writer! I highly recommend this book!!!!
5,Best of Chris Isaak,"You will love this - probably one of the best collection of songs ever. One of the good things about Chris is that he always includes ""Eye Candy"" for the guys as well as doing his own bit for the ladies. Really cool videos to what must be some of the best songs ever recorded."
5,Alabama Thunderpussy,if you like metal music then you will want alabma thunderpussythe music is ausom i got all the albums.
4,Horner's excellent IRIS,"As a musician myself, I immerse myself in all types of classical, film, and opera music -- especially with magnificent writers/performers such as James Horner and Joshua Bell.First, this is the one Horner score that will distinguish itself from his many other soft spoken scores. Many will say, ""Well, it sounds like his music from 'Spitfire Grill,' and it's nothing original anyway."" Liars, liars, pants on fire!! Horner includes some chords from ""Spitfire Grill,"" but this score is very much DIFFERENT from the above score -- this is an original score, people!Second, this is a gentle, delicate, and beautiful score -- very much the opposite from ""The Red Violin"" score. Bell's solos are incredible throughout the CD -- he is able to play so loudly & yet so softly, too -- incredible!Congrats, Dr. Horner!DEFINITELY worth your money!Dimitri Ntatsos"
4,"Remember ""The Spitfire Grill""","If you liked ""The spitfire grill"" soundtrack, also composed by James Horner, then you'll love ""Iris""."
1,This was the most confusing book I have ever read.,"This was the most confusing, jumbled up, out-of-order book I have ever read. It is next to impossible to follow. It sounds as if Renault is more concerned with using ""big"" words and a confusing plot, than in making the reader understand and feel."
5,BEACH OGLER,"Well, Yusaku's dream has finally come true! He's gonna get to see his great love Kyoko in a revealing swimsuit as he agrees to take little brat Kentaro to the beach. It's too bad that his rival, tennis coach Mitaka is also along for the ride. But he has one thing on his side! Mitaka is deathly afraid of dogs, including Kyoko's Mr. Soichiro. Maybe Yusaku will get to show his macho side and prove he's the better man? That's if he can endure Mitaka and Kyoto going out on a date. Yusaku himself has his own miniature shojo romance going too, when he meets up with Kozue, a former co-worker, when he's desperate for a date.Rumiko Takahashi is a master, or should I say mistress, of creating awesome and endearing characters. Her designs are beautiful and her style is very recognizable. The great thing about Maison Ikkoku is that no single element overwhelms you. The comedy, romance, and at times deep emotion all work in harmony with each other. Very well written and funny. Masterpiece."
4,sharp minidv,"Just got my sharp minidv and is a beauty, very simple to use, did not have to look at the manual at all, menu's are very clear and logical,is light and small, just a little bigger than my fuji digital camera, video recordings are excellent and sound is very good to excellent, depending on what mode you choose.IMHO a very good buy, I'd like to have a screen protector and I think the smart media card should be included."
3,Worked 1 week fine,"I liked the size and the quality of pictures. The digital pictures were good also. The problem is getting the pictures to play back. Seems the clogged head syndrome appeared. The picture was distorted and now after 1 month, I have to return the camera for repairs. For the cost of this camera, one would expect to use it more than once every month. I think the price of this camera should reflect that of one that has a manufacturers rebuild. Recent research shows we will be waiting for parts to get it fixed."
3,Get a warranty with Sharp camcorders,"This one, and others break. They break without warning, and you are out 500 to 800 dollars.Buy the camcorder from a store that is authorized by Mack Video (they do all camera, and video repair)You can get a 4 year video warranty for about $50 and it's a good warranty."
4,Starts early and keeps going,"This book has a wide range of activities that use common household items. My daughter is developmentally delayed and this book really helps with ideas to hone her fine and gross motor as well as cognitive skills. There are many ""toys"" she will play with daily, even after that week has gone by."
3,A little tedious,"This book comes highly recommended by parenting groups.And, while you'll find lots of interesting ideas in these pages,there are some that on a day-to-day basis may bore you, frankly.As an eager new Mama, 6 years ago, I tried to diligently follow this book weekly as it suggests.But by the time my boy was 3 it was collecting dust on the shelf.I'd suggest thumbing through, finding your favorite ideas ahead of timeand pulling it out at the appropriate age so you don't get tired of it too quickly.Inspiring, but a little tedious."
4,Do it yourself composter,"This composter comes with about 30 pieces, which require assembly. Putting it together was a bit of a challenge, but once it's finished you can start composting. (Make sure that all of the logo stamps in the back are facing the same way.) The side door sticks, so beware. Also, there is no bottom to this unit. The lid secures very tightly, so you don't have to worry about squirrels or other animals trying to get into the box. This product is made in Canada!"
2,Smells last only about a month,"The cedar smell, once out of the package, lasts only about 3 weeks, So make sure to order some cedar oil to spray it with every so often."
5,excellent!,"Beautiful pictures, fascinating in their ambiguous interpretations. For anyone who likes Escher, these are many artists, all of the works worthy of long perusal."
5,Great Illusion book,Really great coffee table book - excellent pictures and the details on the authors are amazing. Very highly recommended.
2,Deceptive Search Results!,I did a search for Vladamir Kush and this book came up 2nd. I expected to see his work included but it was no where to be found...just other artists. Some of the work was interesting but it just wasn't what I was looking for. Deceptive search results is more like it!
2,Adult content,My 8 year old is an outstanding artist and I purchased this book to stimulate that ability. The book has graphic images of both male and female naked bodies and body parts. Not what I was expecting.
5,optical illusions,20 different artists are featured with biographical information that adds to the reader's appreciation of their works. There are websites and suggested further readings for those interested in pursuing the subject. The book is a wonderful mix of color and black and white reproductions. A great addition to anyone's collection of optical illusions.
4,So far so good...,"I am still watching Season one, but so far the story is intriguing and I enjoy the fight choreography."
4,"Great Show, but where's the episode guide?","I had been waiting for a box set of this show. I caught it a few times during its original run and knew it would be a show I would love. I didn't want to buy the individual seasons so when this came along I was psyched! The only major gripe I have is the lack of episode summaries. The book included in this set is really kind of pointless. It would have been useful to have an episode guide, like the BUFFY box set has. There are times when days or weeks will pass and then I will forget what episode I left off with. An episode guide would help a lot! Other than that, love this set and love this show!!!"
4,"Stupid design, good product","I bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday. After reading the other reviews and seeing all the horror stories about discs being scratched and unplayable, I checked every disc immediately after the product arrived. Most of the discs were in good shape, but some had minor scratches. Nothing too bad, but the design is just stupid. I was very impressed with the actual look of the box, and the secret compartment is pretty cool. If only the disc sleeves didn't induce scratching. Overall, a very good product though."
3,Packing could have been better,Everything went ok with purchasing etc but when the article arrived the box was squashed and the top part needs to be stuck back on. The reason I purchased this pack was for the Rambaldi artifact box and it was for a present. I realise that it had a long way to travel but I am disappointed it was not packed a lot better. All the discs seem ok and in good order. I will think twice about buying this way again.
5,For Die-Hard ALIAS fans,The Rambaldi artifact box replica is amazing! It may even take you a few trys to get it open. And there are great extras on all the season DVDs and bonus DVD. There's even a secret compartment...
4,Upscale in the Veneto,"Any fine old house one chooses to restore immediately turns into a money pit--all the more so a historic Palladian villa in the Veneto. Thank goodness there are people able to do it--and to write about it in as engaging a manner as Sally Gable. With the restoration project comes a whole new life for the Gables, complete with new friends, hosts of visitors, and Venetian country recipes. This is a delightful book for anyone acquainted with this unique part of Italy or planning to become acquainted with it."
4,sweet,"This is a pretty decent Action/RPG for PS2, It's kinda more of a rental in my opinion, though. The graphics suck, the controls are a little weird, and it takes up 1,499kb of space on the memory card!! Holy crap!! Drakan is still worth a try, though."
4,Glad I purchased this remote,This remote is the best in the business. I did not give it 5-stars because the user has to remove the batteries when not in use. Wish it had an on-off switch.
2,Laser dies quickly just like the VP4300,This was the second atempt to try the Interlink Remote after disappointed with the VP4300. It had almost the identical problem as the VP4300 except the buttons are a little firmer. The control of PowerPoint is excellet except again the blank screen button is often accidentally pressed during the presentation.My biggest problem is the laser. It is way too weak and dies often in the middle of a presentation.
4,Very Good CD - With some flaws,"This band is very good compared to most Latin ""Rock"" bands. Most Latin ""Rock"" bands tend to be poppy and not really rock - they are just labeled that way. This band, however, is very good. Sure, there are some pop songs on here, but most songs have an 80's metal feel, which is very rare in today's music scene."
2,Same Info Is Easily Available Elsewhere (On web),"Somewhat useful book in that it pulls together the info that is readily available on the internet, particularly from state government websites."
5,A MUST if you're switching to Linux,"This is perhaps the best book that I have ever read for learning to adminster Linux Servers. It assumes that you already have at least basic Windows admin skills and explains by comparison most of the time so that you have a base on which to build. Another awesome book for NT Admins is ""Linux for Windows Addicts: a 12-Step Program for the Habitual Windows User"". Both are great for people like me who work in a mixed Windows/Linux environment."
1,Print Cartridges,"Absolutely the worst....didnt even have ink to print 1 page. Went to Office Max and bought the real thing. I will never buy print cartridges from Amazon again, this is the 2nd time this happened! I wouldnt even give 1 star but it wont allow me to rank it a 0."
4,Good Value,"With a original price tag of only $9.99, this product is a bargain among contructional toys. I bought it for my two-year-old, she enjoys play it with me as I build a house for her. Basically, it is like a chunky version of Lego, with much fewer variation in parts. The smallest parts are large enough so that I don't need to worry that my kid will swallow it. I think it works great as a pre-lego constructional toy."
4,"Mehaz 4"" Mustach Scissors for $11.39","Researched for a week online to find the best scissors for trimming the Mustach growth.Mehaz seemed to be a well-made scissors but it does seem expensive for $11.39If you find it cheaper, I did definitely recommend this."
1,Not Worth the Money,This is a really cheap book that gives poor samples of cover letters and resumes. I could have done better w/o it!
2,not so good,this b daman is not that good. the shot is slow and the horn always falls off. buy this b daman just for the focus barrel and then attach it to a b daman like cobalt blade or chrome zephyr.
2,Not fun,"Mindless repetitive missions and lackluster gameplay. Just isn't fun, even for the couple bucks I paid for it."
3,"Okay, But Not as Great as GTA 3","This game is made by Rockstar games, who makes great game's like Max Payne and, of course, Grand Theft Auto 3. This game is basically GTA3, without the ability to drive. There are missions where you either blow something up, beat someone up, or retrieve something. The announcer in the game gets extremely annoying and the civilians can get in the way. If you want a much better game get Grand Theft Auto 3, otherwise just make this a rental."
2,Only fun if you like repitition,Here are two reasons why you shouldn't buy this game:1. Mercenaries2. Any Grand Theft Auto Game after GTA2
3,Should I? Or shouldn't I?,"I'm 12 and I got this game because it was recommended to me by a friend. ITS GREAT FUN! (for about 15 minutes). I complete it almost straight away. Come on! I seriously think rockstar games should have made it alittle better. Besides, it could have been a great game, but that just wasn't to be."
2,this game bites,"I dont know how people can actually rave about this game, it is one of the worst games I have played. The graphics arent very sharp, the rioters all run in circles, it is STUPID. Dont waste your money on this. ... What a disappointment."
1,State of Emergency,TOATALY GARBAGE this game has got to be the worst game I have ever purchased. I took it back to the store within 24 hours after I bought it. This game was a total let down and about face from a great game such as GTA3. I only buy good games and this wasn't one
1,not even worth a rental,"state of emergency - PS2 games get worse and worse. it is only fun for the first 15 minutes or so, then you can just throw it away or burn it on the camp fire."
1,THIS GAME IS GREAT!..... for 5 minutes,"Yep you heard me right, this game is fantastic.. For the first 5 minutes, it gets oooollld sooo fast. Doing the same missions over and over again it just seems so bland. do yourself a favor and go rent this game. you will hate it."
2,Nothing like a good old fashioned riot,"I don't know what to make of this game. I think the idea is for it to be serious, but I wound up laughing at this game while playing it. You are going against the corporation and all h*ll breaks loose. For that matter, everything breaks loose. The crowd is all rioting by breaking into stores and stealling. You go around with your trusty baseball bat and club people to a nice pulp. But wait till the cops get a hold of you. You won't be a happy camper for long. Basically, the idea is interesting, if not a little warped. But the final verdict is that it is boring to play and has very little story line, if any, to keep you wanting more. I would say I got a few good laughs out of it. You haven't lived until you have seen a town go on a riot rampage. Speaks volumes about how RockStar sees society. Lots of people were looking forward to this game. It is luck that there wasn't a riot after they found out how poor the game was. Good thing I only borrowed the game."
1,AAAARRRRGGGHHHH!!!!,WHAT A LETDOWN!!! I bought this game thinking that it was going to be a next level GTA but it wasn't. I never got past the mall because the game was too ridiculous and all you are doing is running around the whole time which is so stupid. Rockstar could have kept this game in the closet.
2,A Big Disappointment,"Normally I like the ideas of a ""smashmouth"", in your face type of game but this really stunk. State of Emergency was not fun on the basis of getting beat down by 50 guys isn't fun. I could barely clear the second stage. The only thing that people keep telling me about how fun this game is, is because you're in a RIOT. O.k. what else? - Blank stares and immediate silence -Yeah I thought so.Really, everytime I'd complete a level and from what I thought was a high score, I'd lose twice as many points because of civilian casualities? Um, hello if you're in a RIOT and you're stealing and breaking stuff, wouldn't that make you a criminal too?My thoughts are my own but if you have your heart set on getting this game, rent it first and then see what you think.Happy Gaming!"
2,State of Boredom,"Unlike many people, I was not expecting a GTA3 clone when I rented State of Emergency. I've learned to not do that when it comes to games. That fact notwithstanding, I was still pretty disappointed in this game.The premise is not so bad, but the execution leaves much to be desired. The missions get stale very quickly. Though, I didn't play very far into it, so maybe they get better? Serving as an escort for rebellion force members that can't/won't fight is rather disheartening. Also, I have a complaint about the aiming mechanism, namely that there wasn't one. You just sort of have to point your weapon in the general direction of the goons and shoot. Combine this with the sometimes awkward camera angles, and you have a difficult time offing the Corporation with anything but your bare hands or a melee weapon. The game is not all bad, though. The music and sound effects were nicely done, the graphics were excellent, and the sheer chaos of the levels were fantastic.<BR..."
2,GTA3 is better,"Although this game is entertaining, its gets old fast and repetitive. The goals are timed and a little too coached. If your a kid you'll love this game, but if your a little more mature and like a more realistic feel to a game, get GTA3. I wished I had not wasted my money on this game, but with any game... it's a gamble. If you want a hot new game, I suggest MAXIMO. Now there is a fun game with all the goodies."
1,Bad,"No Plot, sense less no point violence. If some one can tell me wha the point of making this game is I may pay you. This game flat out [isn't good]"
3,WHOAH!!! don't think this is GTA,"The first thing that i would like to say is if you are under the age of 18, do not play this game (you won't be able to buy it anyways).When i first got it, i had such high intentions afterall GTA 3 is probably one of the top 3 best games ever. Most people have not even played the game who are posting messages...Ratings out of 10Gameplay-5: Fun for the first little bit, but then it's so repetitive that you really get sick of the game. Going around killing everything in site the same way for a long time is boring...funny at first, but then very boringSound-5: GTA had great tunes for everyone....This has your lame basic video game musicGraphics-8: Have to grade kind of high here just because it's amazing how they can have so many different characters on the screen at onceFun Scale:First couple hours-7: Fun, but kind of dissapointing because it's not what you expected50% through-4-5: WHY DIDN""T I RENT IT FIRSTOverall: 5-6: (...)"
1,booooooooo!,"Man this game stinks.It was fun at first for about three days.The graphics are bad,the missions suck, and man it gets boring. This game is not worth [money] at all."
1,NOT in the same league as GTA III,"I couldn't wait to get this. GTA is the greatest game - ever!I can't stand playing this for more then 15 minutes. It's mind-numbing just running around doing the same thing over and over.The characters are funny for the first 5 minutes, but that's it. I rented it, and didn't even keep it the full 5 days. Thank God I didn't buy it. I think Rockstar just threw some [stuff] together while GTA is still hot. The story line, block graphics, lack of plot, and awful gameplay all show that they put zero thought or effort into this game.I guess I'll just have to wait for GTA IV."
5,Naturally The BOMB,To get started Rockstar has come on out wit awesome games. Grand theft auto 3 is one of their games and all i heard about it is that it is great. This game has incredible features such as the weapons and gameplay. Goin around blowin up things and robbin banks is what makes this game da BOMB! I think u would have a blast rollin wit dis game. So start da engine and punch the nos button to get to Best Buy before u go home empty handed!
1,"I'm in a ""State of Disappointment""","I guess if your 13 years old and have no clue what is actually entertaining, You'll love this game."
4,Great for 30degF and under!,These are great running tights for the cold winter runs. From 30 deg F road marathons to 20 deg F trail marathons.Draw back is that although I was between the small and xsmall I had to go with the small because of my curves; this makes it slide a little after maybe 10 miles. Other than that I am very happy with the purchase. Ski season is approaching so I might try them for that as well.
5,Great edition!,"Great edition, have a nice book with wonderful pictures and hace 5 blu-rays!The 3 Batman films in ony one book."
5,perfect!,i purchased this for a friend wishing that i myself didn't already have the first two! the casing and the book that comes with it make it the perfect package!
2,Wish I hadn't Bought It,"Packaging is weak. Not great special features. Not the blue ray collection that Gothan deserves, not the blu ray collection gotham needs."
5,Great collection!,I watched it multiple times! Nothing bad to say about it. Some questionable story line directions or acting but overall it delivers a full entertainment satisfying me and my family.
1,Digital Copy SUCKS!!!,"If you are buying this for the digital copy... DON'T!!! It's thru UltraViolet/Flixster and is definitely not worth the extra money. I've yet to get it to work. Sucks, when you buy this for a 14 year old who expects to be able to watch it on his iPod and it won't work."
1,TOOK TOO LONG,I was told/read that this product would ARRIVE withing 2-3 days. I BOUGHT this product about a week BEFORE Christmas and it STILL DID NOT COME. DISAPPOINTED! And this was a gift for my family member!
5,Its Batman what more do you need?!,"Could get the 3rd movie on Blu Ray for $22 at Walmart, or pre-order the set for $27.00 or whatever I payed for at the time. Was a no brainer. Plus it is Batman and all three of these movies are a must have. Picture book that comes along with it is an extra bonus worth having!"
5,THE DARK KNIGHT HAS ARISEN!,"I Ordered this from amazon, after it was sold out and best buy within the same day. I was so frustrated because there's the only two places within my driving distance that would have the movie for that price. It came within three days and I was so happy. best 30$ I ever spent. im watching it as we speak and for 30$ it's a steal. all three movies on blu-ray plus bonus disks and a book in a soft shelled case. what's not to like. I do notice that amazon has boosted the price on everyone else after. I dont know why but i guess it's a fast seller and someone is making tons of money off the cuts. But 50$ is still not bad for a boxset of the greatest superhero story besides the avengers... ever..."
5,BATMAN,Ordered 4 sets of these. 1 for me and 3 for Christmas gifts. Everyone loved them. The box set has a cool rubberized kind of feel. Looks impressive. Any Batman fan would love this collection.
2,Faulty disc,"I purchased this for my father's birthday. By the time he tried watching the third disc, the return window had closed. The disc does not play at all and he's now stuck with a non-working end to an awesome trilogy."
5,WTH is the UltraViolet copies,"@ BrainWash89 wrote: ""Just got mine in the mail. It does indeed come with UltraViolet copies of all 3 movies!""You might be thinking ""WTH is UltraViolet?"" It's the digital copy. It just has the code on it.You go to flixter.com/getUVYou type the code that is listed on the little UltraViolet paper that comes with the DVD Set.It tells you what to do from there!!!!I bought this for a family member and secretly wanted to just keep it for myself.They let me have the UltraViolet digital copy though.So now I am a very happy camper!!!"
4,Great value for great trilogy,"One of the best movie trilogy, no doubt, as I'm sure many will agree. Great value for all 3 movies. Only thing is the packaging smells and feels kind of funny."
3,You do get the movies...but...,"I still can't get over the lack of behind the scenes footage. Really lacking in that department. I mean, it's a plus cause you have all three movies. I would wait though."
1,If you want a Deluxe Collectors Edition do not buy this!! Updated 12/20/12,The movies were great and are even better when watching them back to back. However when I bought my Blu-Ray player I made the decision to buy only the premium products (deluxe edition/special editions/directors cuts etc etc) I did not want to clutter up my collection with movies I might watch once or maybe twice. The things I buy now I know I will watch at lease several times. The reason I gave it one star is simply because AFTER you open it there is a little piece of paper telling you that in 2013 there will be a Deluxe Edition box set released. I would have rather waited and paid a little more for the deluxe edition.Also each disk goes from scenes in full screen to letterbox and back again but I am told that is because of the IMAX scenes.If you are like me and want to buy the special/deluxe editions in box sets do not buy this YET.
4,What was intended for.,Very nice compilation with the whole trilogy. Nice case and the booklet is a definite bonus. Extra features are as good as you can get.
5,Excellent Movie,"The best movie ever!!! i like this series if you're fan you need to buy this epic movie, i really enjoy blue ray format..."
5,Great buy,Great item and enjoyable collection. Son loved getting this collection for Christmas. This sucks to have to use 15 words.
5,Batman,I bought this as a Christmas present for my dad. He loved it! Definitely a great value for what I paid
4,a great collection,a great collection for the nolan batman fan. the 3 films in glorious blu ray and the 2 bonus discs give a great collection to own for batman fans.
5,Good Trilogy,"My son wanted these and is thrilled with this set. It comes with a book that includes pictures of the 3 movies. Good buy, delivered on time and intact."
3,Widescreen Format Changes Throughout 3rd Film,"Unfortunately, this trilogy does not allow a viewer the chance to watch the 3rd movie (The Dark Knight Rises) in a consistent 2.35:1 ratio. This common cinematic ratio is used in most ""widescreen"" films on DVD and Blu-Ray. Throughout the 3rd film, the format will change from 16:9, then to 2.35:1, then to 16:9 again.This is a disappointment to have the Trilogy released with such a blatant flaw."
5,"Great product, exactly as described!","The product is great, exactly as described by Amazon.The movie quality is good and I got the concept art book which I wanted.Besides, good price... excellent purchase. Recommended to all Bat fans."
4,great saga but not the best nolan movie or neither the best batman flicks,"i really enjoyr this films as a batman fan and movie lover but there is still something missing. these film are cold, spiritless but really well done. the packaging is excellent by the way in comparison with the french one."
2,No iTunes,"No iTunes codes are available just dumb uv codes that can't be used to please these great movies on your Apple TV. Who wants to watch a great movie like this on a 9"" screen. No thanks."
1,Flawed Digital Technology,"60 minutes after I started, and Flixster will not link to Ultraviolet, so I cannot watch the promised digital copies of the movies. I don't know if this is a temporary problem or something ongoing, but either way it is unforgivable force a DRM system on your paying customers and then waste their time when it does not work. I may be in for a fight as I try to get a complete refund for a defective product even though the seal is broken on the physical copies. The quality of the content is irrelevant if you cannot get through a flawed DRM delivery system."
4,Awesome,The pack is incredible. It arrived on time and it was shipped carefully. The BD menus were static or the movie just started. That was the only thing I dislike. Thanks amazon
5,Exactly what I expected,"In my opinion, these are the best Batman movies ever. It is definitely cheaper to buy this set than to buy each movie separate. Each disk contains extra features and this set comes with a 60(+/-) page booklet about the making of the movie.The sound and image quality is superb so if you are a Dark Knoght fan you will not be disappointed."
5,Super happy!!!,"Great set for a Dark Knight fan! The booklet is nice, digital copies of all 3 movies plus a 23 minute sneak peek of the batmobile documentary, and 5 blu rays for less then $30 is a great deal!"
5,GREAT!,I bought this dirt cheap at like 26 bucks. Would definetly recommend if you can get near that price again.
5,Very Good Trilogy,"Without any of the Xtras you can probably see on YouTube, on sale for $17 & still living in a standard definition DVD household - how could I refuse.Three great movies. I will watch them many times over."
5,You won't regret owning this.,"Just awesome. In my opinion, a must own trilogy for all batman and action movie fans. The quality is superb."
3,so so content,"It doesn't tell me anything, and it seems to make believe. I got the DVD in good condition."
2,Cute item at a great cost,"A great gift for a 4-year old who will play with it for a little while, because that's about how low it will lasts.....a little while. All and all, worth the $1.99 cost."
2,Broken hearted princess,4 year old daughter was so excited when she opened the box. Carried it everywhere for one day. Broke when it hit the ground
1,Just don't work,"I bought this ear plugs, are uncomfortable, my ears hurt, and in the first use, just fall down I just prefered the ones who are made of pvc, are better."
4,Great book for early readers and reading aloud,"This book is great for a short history lesson, for the pre-school to grade 3 student. The chapters are usually 1 page with a picture on the opposite side.If you are looking to teach history to the youngest, or a child attention span this book is for you.The hardcover book is pretty costly for 20-30 minutes of information. Hopefully the paperback will be more affordable."
5,bed time favorite,"I really enjoy these drawings! Simple but so touching!It does to philosophy what high intellectual speculating cannot achieve: touch your hearth with the reality of everyday living. A treat every night before falling asleep!European drawings are certainly known the world over as masterly executed cartoons; but here, in Bill Watterson's series of Calvin and Hobbes, the American's sense of humour express itself by reaching the intellectual and the down to earth feeling! It brings back memories of childhood and fundamental questions adults rarely take the time to ponder, even for themselves! Five stars for this delectable reading!"
4,Good Condition,Good condition and fast delivery. I was dissapointed that it was smaller than I expected.
3,"Sometimes delightful, often taxing","Of the four Caudwell mysteries, this is the one to read last or not at all. That Wildean wit and off-center logic that are a part of the characters in all four books are there, but Good Grief! the wading one must do through tax codes, financial details and fiduciary claptrap. Caudwell becomes almost pedantic about government regulation on tax matters (will there be a quiz after?) and that is very tiring. Any of the other three is a better choice, particularly as a first Caudwell read. (Note: Given a vote in the matter, I do believe that Prof. Tamar is female, though it seems not to matter one way or another.)"
2,"Disappointing, thin, cursory -- and lazy","I borrow the words ""disappointing,"" ""thin,"" and ""cursory"" from other Amazon reviewers, and I agree with them fully. I would add ""lazy."" I read the Artificial Woman right after Little Big Man, a novel by the same author written 40 years earlier. Little Big Man shows hard work -- lots of historical detail woven into a complex story and told with a distinctive voice. Artificial Woman has none of these virtues. It reads as though the author had a kernel of a decent idea but didn't feel like putting much energy into the project. There is some sex, but it is uninteresting. There is some science, but of the comic book variety. There is some politics, but it is inane. Skip this one unless you feel you simply must read everything by this prolific author based on the remarkable talent he has shown in other stories."
5,Very good Product,Nice picture quality and decently priced. ordered two of them and both turned out good. . . . . .
1,Died within 4-months,"Bought this item for my home theater to hook up my computers to my projector for netflix movies. My new laptop has only HDMI outputs. This cable worked fine for 3-months, then on the fourth monthly promptly died. I have tried this cable with 3 different computers and 2 different projectors all with the same result - no signal detected. Contacted importer520 for a replacement and below was their response. Not unreasonable but now I will leave my negative review: Look elsewhere for a better quality product!""Dear Customer,Thank you for contacting us regarding your inquiry.Our return/refund policy states that the request needs to be made within 30 days of receiving the merchandise. Unfortunately, your order has exceeded the 30 days. We sincerely apologize for the situation. Your patience and understanding are greatly appreciated. If you have other questions or concerns, feel free to contact us.Best Regards,Lisa M.Customer Service"""
1,Only HDMI Cable out of five I own that doesn't work with anything!,"Have to return it. I tried plugging this into my receiver, blue ray, and cable box to no avail. All my other cables work in all of my devices."
1,Does not work,Simply did not work out of the box. It detected my display but did not... display. Don't fall for this.
1,Quality has gone down,I had purchased this product in the past and was happy with it. Last week I received another cable and it's not the same. It is too thin. Even the 3-6' HDMI cables that I own are much thicker than this one.
2,Broke in 2 weeks,"I bought it because it was the cheapest 25 feet one I could find. But it just stopped working suddenly when I plugged it in to my laptop, 2 weeks after I bought it. When I first got it. I noticed the metal part of the ends were kinda lose from the casing on both ends. Now side seems to be even more lose than the other. I guess it wasn't built for use in a dorm room environment, being plugged and re-plugged multiple time a week. If your just gonna plug it in to something and leave it there forever maybe this is for you. If you are a relatively heavy user, probably not.I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Not like picture,"The one i got has 2 round coils at each end, harder to pull in a wall. I get picture from my blu-ray player every third time i turn it on. Brand new tv and blu-ray. I new the price was too good."
1,Not Good,"I purchased this 1 month back it worked find until today, but suddenly the end that connects to computer broke and I am unable to fix it.."
1,Bad experience with this cable,"This cable failed after about 40 days. Picture just started going funky green. Replaced the cable works fine. A very inexpensive cable, but I would still expect it to work for more than 40 days."
4,Good deal. Works.,"I really didn't expect much, but it was the best available deal at the time. I needed an inexpensive way to connect a tablet to a receiver. Surprisingly, it does the trick."
2,"Ordered 2, one was a dud, one wasn't, no response from seller","I ordered the second cable before I unpacked the first, in whose sheath there were some small punctures. Fortunately, the second cable was free of damage and works fine. (The first cable transmits the signal but little white dots of noise show up in the otherwise good picture.) I contacted the seller about the damaged cable in the first order and got no response, which is why I have to give 2 stars. The one cable that wasn't a dud works fine getting HD signal from my FIOS DVR to my Samsung 1080p TV and also works getting HD signal from my Samsung Blu-ray player to the same TV. The good news is that the price of these cables is so cheap that I can afford to order another one risking it not working instead of buying some fancy cable. By the way, anyone who is shopping around for HDMI cables, just ask an electrical engineer who will tell you that HDMI quality is not important because of the error correction in the signal, etc."
1,Doesn't work,"If you like a lottery and have $10 to spend on something, try buying this cable. If you win, you get $30 worth product, just of lower quality. If you lose you get what I get - piece of cable that doesn't work.Connected laptop to the TV and there's no signal (works with other 6' cable for $8)"
1,Cable didn't work.,Order a different brand and save yourself the trouble of sending them back. I was very disappointed I wasted my time.
1,Didn't Work,"I bought this cable in May 2012 and didn't immediately need it. In December 2012, I purchased a Blu-Ray player and connected it to my HDTV using this HDMI cable. The player would not output any video higher than 480p - standard definition. I tried a different HDMI cable and the Blu-Ray Player worked perfectly. That leads me to believe this HDMI cable was dead on arrival. I cannot recommend it."
1,1080p from projector to ps3 doesn't work,"took me a minute to figure out why my ps3 and all my other 1080p devices were not appearing on my 1080p projector after buying this cable, until i switched over to my 720p apple tv and it was working fine. this cable can't handle 1080p, on any device i own, don't buy."
5,GREAT BUY!,"So I bought this product simply for how cheap the cost was and I love it! been using it for about a month and still working, so definitely worth the cost!"
1,Doesn't support 1080p,"This 25 feet hdmi cable is a junk. It gives me a green blurry screen. I knew it was the cable so I performed some testing. I changed the settings to auto and it gave me 720 output, then I try to manually choose 1080p, but It didn't let me, I got an ""unsupported resolution"" Are you kidding me? I'm using a Pioneer 1021 with a Mitsubishi HC3800. Then I went to the big box store and bought a monster cable to test. HUGE difference. Everything worked as designed. Now with this I'm not saying go ahead and buy a Monster cable because I think they are overpriced (i return it :) ). This is a horrible quality hdmi cable, I though about saving money when I bough this piece of junk, but I was so wrong, Invest on a good cable if you are going to be running a 25"" cable."
1,Not worth the cheap price,"I bought this cable to connect a desktop computer to a second monitor that is mounted across the room. The cable sort of worked, in that I did get picture. However, the picture was filled with snow/static and vertical lines across the screen. I was able to navigate my desktop but the static and lines were obviously unacceptable. I tested the equipment using another HDMI cable and everything worked perfectly. I contacted The OEM Shop and to their credit they sent me a replacement promptly at no charge. I received it today and sure enough, I had the same problem. Once again I tested the equipment with another cable and it worked fine. I'm not sure if these are defective or just lousy quality. Either way, it won't work for me. I'm sending these back for a refund. I'll have to spend a little more for something that works."
2,not woking cable,"The cable was used for my led projector and after hook up the picture was distorted and non viewable,I dont think the length had anything to do with it because I used a monster cable same legnth,and thank goodness it worked,the price of the item was inexpensive compare to the monster cable,so I guess you get what you pay for, case in point.But on the plus side the led projector that I bought through amazon works great and I am very pleased with it!"
5,"Great cable, beware who you buy it from.","I purchased one of these cables last year through Amazon and it works great. I needed a second one for the office and ordered again through Amazon this time from a different seller (Importer520). While the cable arrived quickly as usual with Amazon Prime Fulfillment, it does not work. When comparing the new cable to the one from last year; the new cable is different from the product photo whereas the old cable is identical to the photo (the lines on the back of the plug are straight on the new cable, the old one has curves like in the product photo). Luckily Amazon rocks for returns.While it's possible Link Depot changed the connectors they're using, I'll warn people to be careful who they purchase from as it's possible that this one particular seller is substituting inferior products.In short: great cable, just be careful who the seller is."
3,"Quality, low cost HDMI cables with overly fat cords","These appear to be of quality construction and low cost compared to the stores and other mail order suppliers. Remember that as far as digital signals go, it either works or doesn't. It will not effect picture or sound quality. (the same applies to most analog cable but that's so yesterday)However, the cords are relatively fat and stiff compared to many others. Not a problem if stuffed behind furniture but challenging if threaded through certain types of conduit, especially the cosmetic surface mount conduit. You can easily run out of space if you are running 2 or 3 of these."
1,"Poor signal, constant video dropout","I guess I got a bad cable, because I get a solid connection between my DVR box and TV for about 2 seconds, then it drops out for a while, then a few seconds again, repeat. Obvious I'm just not getting enough signal through the cable to get the video stream. Considering all the good reviews I guess I got a dud. My only option is to return it so I guess I'll do that and try a slightly more expensive cable to see if I get better results."
1,Bad Cable,I bought this cable to connect iPod and iPad to a TV. The cable worked on and off right out of the box. I kept having to unplug it and then plug it back in to the device to keep it connected. After a couple days it didn't work at all. I know it's a bad cable because I tested with a shorter cable and I was able to connect my device just fine.
5,Why pay more???,"If you are looking to purchase hdmi cable and you go to Radio Shack, Best Buy or other retail outlets you will get taken behind the shed and beaten thoroughly. 25ft cable at radio shack $140 approx, best buy $180, are you kidding me. Link Depot's cables are a freaction of the cost and work just fine with the same clarity as higher priced hdmi cables. There are not different levels of quality with hdmi cables. Save your money."
2,My bad..,"I ordered this to connect my HP laptop to my Vizio LDC 42"" tv but it is only a usb connection not the right fit for either.My bad."
5,Long and work,"The cable is long and it works great. I can definitely tell I am getting HD quality. Now, I can play Diablo III and StarCraft II on my 60"" TV."
2,DOA,"The cable almost worked, but the image was not correct, it could best be described as digital looking signal fuzz. Just sent it back, so far its been a hassle free return."
1,Dead at the door,Straight out of the Box this HDMI cable didn't work. couldn't get any signal at all. Tried multiple sources to multiple displays. NO video or audio at all. I'm returning it today for a refund.
1,Terrible - do not buy!,"I bought this cable to watch HD videos from my laptop on my HD TV. The first movie I watched showed red lines across the screen intermittently for the entire movie! When I attached a different cable (Fanatic Digital HDMI-to-HDMI Cable Ultra Clarity 6') to the same computer and TV and played the same movie, the quality was much better and there were no red lines. The only variable was this cable - don't waste your time or money!"
1,Horrible Cable,The cable did not work and not only that but it shorted out my HDMI port on a brand new projector. Amazon refunded the cost of the cable.
3,"Great length, Questionable Quality","It was very difficult to find an HDMI cable that was over 20 feet, so I was overjoyed when I found this on Amazon. The quality of the couplers could be better, though."
5,Super,Cable is very handy and easy to move from both computers in house to the television to display downloaded movies and music.
5,Really can't beat this HDMI cable for price,"I got this for my projector installation. It works perfectly with no problems with audio and video. Whatever you do, unless you need a HDMI cable immediately (like right this second), DO NOT GO TO A BIG BOX STORE or a place with Shack in the name to buy a HDMI cable. They are always priced 10-25 times a functionally perfect equivalent like this one."
5,great price for this product,"I bought this to connect my laptop to my television across the room. This cable was going for almost 4 to 5 times the price at other stores so when I saw this price, I jumped on it. This cable works as good as the more expensive ones at a fraction of the cost. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a longer HDMI cable."
1,3-sided Black Rotating revolving earring countertop display,"This thing was a flimsy piece of crap that fell apart within the first 15-minutes we used it. The screws fell out of the vertical parts and the tabs that hold the earring cards snap off if you barely touch them. Do not buy this, its a waste of money. Crap like this should be removed from the Amazon marketplace."
4,A true story of courage and friendship,"Poorly prepared, two friends, and their half-indian manservant ""George"", decide to travel deep in to the interior ofLabrador. The hardship they endure and the hard choices they make are a testimony to the resilience of the human spirit.This book gives great insight into what life was like in eastern Canada at the turn of this century."
3,Heavy Reading for a Heavy Counter Culture,"A book of essays with a nice blend of philosophical wondering, sociological research, and amusing anectdotes. A good description of the anti-stereotypical gay male. I enjoyed most of the book except the essays that went into deep psychological jargon. They seemed out of place in a book dealing with down to earth men."
5,Translation Teachers Should Read This Book,"It is unfortunate that the only other reviewer of this book (so far, November 2003) has chosen to focus only on politics. As a teacher of translation, I have found Mona Baker's book to be invaluable, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has the somewhat thankless task of trying to teach an unteachable subject. For people who are trying to teach themselves some of the finer points of translation, this book is an excellent place to start, or pick up some pointers."
1,for advanced readers,"It's an advanced book, if you're latin american and English is your second language, I don't recomend this book, it has arabic, french.. explanations that it will make you confuse"
2,Save your money- just buy the battery,"I get tired of Suunto charging 10x what something is worth. This is an example of them overcharging. Although they claim you could damage your watch if you don't use your tool, I would just use a penny to open the watch, replace it with a battery from your local drugstore, then put the same cap back on. I just don't think there is a need for all the extra crap."
1,"Correct part number, wrong part!","This is the fourth or fifth time I've replaced the watch battery in my t6. The newer covers (with a short straight edge that facilitates removal) and installation tool are great. I hope Amazon has fixed my problem by now. My order arrived and the battery kit (battery, replacement tool & cover with ""O"" ring) had been relabeled. The ""new"" part number was correct but this was NOT the battery kit for the t6. This kit had no tool, a different cover (lacking the short straight edge) and a battery that was 3 mm too large for the watch.I placed a subsequent order on Suunto's web site and everything was good. The correct part even arrived faster from Suunto than from Amazon (I am in the USA).Amazon gets one star for the quick credit to my account. This is the only time (since the 90's?) I've been shipped the wrong product by Amazon."
3,Rick Alitzer,"CD case was old and broken. This was obviously not a problem that happened in the mailing process, which was disappointing."
4,umm.....yeah,this is a really cool single...the judith video is really cool and the whole program that runs it on your comp is pretty awsome....the bunk mix is really cool...and the live version is awsome....the play renholder as an intro to it
1,not good,This product does not work well. The pointer is often delayed and the wheel does not respond when it is being used. Im pretty annoyed that I spent my money on this product and if given a chance to do it over I wouldn't have bought this product.
1,Its very pretty... but,"I received this bracelet for Christmas and really love it. It is daintier then I thought it would be but I was actually excited to find that out because I like dainty.I did, however, want a bracelet that I could wear everyday including in the shower never take it off style. After only 2 weeks of wearing this bracelet The pretty mettle pieces that connect the larger round circles started stretching out and are at risk of falling off (and poke me in the wrist and have gotten caught on shirts). I find it weird that those pieces are not fixed in a way that they are a solid piece of metal.I have not contacted anyone about this issue and so I don't know how they would have resolved it.The bracelet is beautiful but is not for everyday wear."
4,DVD version is an editted version of the original.,"The picture and sound quality of these movies are magnificent on this DVD release. However, the explicit penetration scenes have all been removed. While most of the content and storyline remains the same at the original 70's version, the graphic sex scenes have been toned done a lot. The sex scenes have become closer to what one would expect to see in a modern movie by Seduction Cinema."
2,"OK, but not what I expected","I have learned just as much from ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" and could really have done without the African names/meanings and tips on how to use kente cloth in a nursery. ""WHat To Expect..."" is much more thorough, although a lot of the information overlaps. The pictures in ""Mama's Little Baby"" are great, but not sure that you'll really learn how to bathe a baby based on these pictures...Get ""what To Expect"" and save the money..."
5,A must for someone using their Palm for business,"Absolutely the best way to keep your Palm safe, secure, and handy for business. Just the right mix of electronic and paper organizing."
4,HMMM,"GEMINI IZ ONE OF MY TOP FAVORITE RAPPERZ, LIKE NUMBA 3 OR 2, GREAT LIX, GREAT FLOWZ, GOOD BEATS! HISTORY IN THE MAKING IZ LIKE MY FAVORITE ALBUM! BUT THYS ONE IZ HOT TOO! GO AHEAD GEM, KEEPS STACKIN CASH!"
4,Gemini On the Rise,I read the first review and went out and bought the cd. Its definately a rising album with some tight songs his styles like a mixture of tech n9ne and eminem if you like them go and check this album out and you wont be disapointed.
5,Transparence and delicate Vocal,"Most of the representative music of Jose is collected. The sound quality of the recording is excellent, too.There is a lot of my favorite music, too.If you are his fan, please add this disk to your collection."
3,Better than Campbell's,"This soup isn't bad. It's a step above Campbell's, but not excellent. Several of the cans arrived dented. I was disappointed and canceled my subscription after the first order."
3,beautiful but confusing,"the ring I received was beautiful. But, I admit, I thought I was getting three. I may be a little slow:) and for that price why would I get three, but found the title, photo and description to not be helpful.Recipient LOVED it."
3,nice but...,"I like it because of the color I think, but, each time I plug the ipod in my computer or the ipod speakers I have to take it out of this cover, so, If I had to do it over, I would purchase a cover that I could leave on. Sometimes the cover interfers with the plug for my ear buds too. Cute but for me, not very practical in the long run."
5,The Action Picks Up Here,"This is the DVD which starts the Goku/Piccolo vs. Raditz battle, where the action, that Dragon Ball Z is famous for, starts to pick up. I can hardly wait to see how it is the way it was suppose to be. And with the FUNI cast (the better cast) at the helm, I know it's going to rule!"
4,Triple Double Pleasure,"When this program first came out on CD several years ago, I enjoyed the juxtaposition of pieces. (You had to buy three LPs to get these pieces way back when.) In its ""Living Stereo"" reissue, it sounds less harsh, which is even more pleasing. I just wish BMG would be more generous with program notes. It's fine to use ""original notes whenever possible,"" but how about adding some more recent information? I like to learn about the recording sessions, and a historical perspective of the recordings."
5,Heifetz CD,Anything recorded by Jasha Heifetz is superior to virtually all other classical music recordings. His mastery of both the technical and the emotional sides of music is unsurpassed. Even remastered digital recordings such as this are pleasing to the ear and elevating/transporting for the soul. -- Allen
3,requires a certain type of listener,"I hate Mozart, and Bach's double is a million miles below Heifetz's level. As for the Brahms, all the technical things were there, but there was one thing missing, INTENSITY!!! Bramns is [poor] if the intensity isn't there, and some of the parts that require exploding just get punched, and the typical aloffness of brahms isn't there. Heifetz is of course amazing, and he is not at fault for these shortcomings. The Conductor and the Orchestra were horreible, and I feel bad that Heifetz had to play with such placid accompianistsGo and buy the recording with Itzahk and Yo-Yo Ma, the two are a perfect match, and Barenboim evokes all the intensity one could handle from a superb Chicago Symphony Orchestra."
2,Where do you draw the line?,"An all too predictable indie production: street level story aimed at the youth market with raw editing, dialogue, sound-mixing all indicative of a low (almost no) budget. Unless you are part of the target market the characters and plot become forgettable very quickly.I thought the Extras were of more interest having watched the film. Director Benjamin Morgan and Brant Smith's efforts to get their baby into film festivals and then expect to be suddenly surrounded by distributors wanting to get their hands on the film were touching. No go with Sundance but Berlin accepted, where it joined the dozens of other (better?) films on show. It turns out that word of mouth marketing worked best to pull in the punters. The film's website offers the DVD, a book and a CD so maybe the crew might make a few bucks in the end."
4,Good Movie !,"I really wanted to like this movie more,but the action was a little slow at times. Great acting ! Mr Morgan (Supernatural) does an outstanding job on his character."
4,A good read,"The romantic elements are pretty much predictable.The rest? Intriquing. A very different turn on a known theme. Actually, several different turns ...."
4,good product,"My family uses stevia as their sweetner. This chocolate stevia is pretty good. The price is not bad although I wish it were a little cheaper. My son uses it to sweeten plain yogurt and we use it in milk for chocolate milk. It is a real help when I am trying to raise my kids having as little sugar as possible. It is kind of hard to do when all their friends eat cookies, candies, juice, soda ect. They feel like freaks because we don't have any of that in the house. So stevia helps me out to be able to give them something sweet."
5,soulfull to the bone,this is a very soulfull blues c.d. you can identify the Muddy Waters influence and yet you can feel that unique Willie Big Eye Smith voice with a very tight talented band. Blues lovers you must have this c.d in your collection.
2,Be very cautious when purchasig this mp3 player,"This player is a couple years old, it has no video or picture views or color for that matter. The problem I had was that is malfunctioned most of the time I had it. I had some time to use it, and when it worked, it was enjoyable, but those times were few and far in between.The player functions were pretty good, the voice recorder worked quite well. The ease of use was great, but had too many problems to keep the player I had. Keep in mind, I purchased a refurbished player, not the wisest choice for quality, but for the money, it seemed good.I had to mail the player back to the vendor, because of my many troubles with the player and hopefully they will refund my money. The trouble I went through with this is not worth my time or money for that matter.Seemed good, but not worth the trouble with all the malfunctioning."
5,Willis Harman's finest book,"Willis Harman's ""An Incomplete Guide to the Future"" started me on future studies, and his writings have helped focus my studies since. ""Global Mind Change"" is a powerful statement, digging deep into our language and assumptions as he explores the history and current thought in humanity's attempts to define reality through science. A must read for the new century, and an excellent text for interdisciplinary social and scientific studies."
1,Totally disappointed,"I love Kellerman. I have read all of his books - but this is pretty lame. Too much time spent trying to write like a tough cop, and the pitiful 'cameo' of Alex Delaware at the end seems like a ploy to suck in the loyal following to read this thing. I usually finish a Kellerman novel in under 24 hours. This took weeks, because I just couldn't find enough interest to keep picking it up. I had to re-read ""Over The Edge"" (my favorite Delaware novel) just to keep up my faith in the author. Better luck next time."
2,Kellerman's first disappointing book,"I love Kellerman and have read all his books but this is the first one that I have not enjoyed. I did not like the writing style and found the characters' thoughts to be very dull and simple-minded. I found the book very boring and wanted to put it down but since I paid for the hardback, I felt I needed to read it."
3,Slow Read but Ultimately Satisfying,"This is the first Jonathan Kellerman book I have read and it will probably be the last. Although the storyline was interesting, his writing style is slow, more complicated than necessary and akward. I really enjoyed the sections where Billy was narrating but the bulk of it dragged. I would still recommend it though (hard to believe) because of the overall storyline. When it nears completion, it keeps you reading."
3,Enjoyed this book,Billy Straight was a lovable boy. I wanted to bring him home to join my other children.
3,Kellerman's best book in a long time,"After a deluge of Alex Delaware novels, the last few of which were frankly not up to the standard of the author's earlier books, it was good to see Jonathan Kellerman returning to child psychology which, after all, is his fort√©. The characters are credible and likeable. A good read."
2,Disappointing,"Jonathan Kellerman is one of my favorite authors but this book didn't measure up. There are three parallel stories going at once which breaks up the narrative flow. The characters are not well-developed. What happened to the great psychological insights I've come to expect? Worst of all, there is not much suspense, no amazing twist where some minor character reveals the key needed to unravel the mystery. There was potential here -- a good idea for a plot and potentially interesting characters. It's as if this were the rough draft and not the polished version. I recommend all his other novels except The Web; my favorite is Silent Partner."
2,Packaged very poorly...,"Unfortunately, when I received this ring in the mail, not only was the silver bent (so the ring was at a weird angle), but the lapis stone had fallen out. The ring was packaged very poorly and the ring suffered for the mistake that was made."
3,Exhausting,"Sometimes it's hard to stop the research, hard not to tell just one more amusing story, very hard not to add just one more fact. This is what keeps Finlay's book from being a total success. Instead of exhaustive, it's exhausting. The result is that the reader--this one, at least--starts skimming and then loses interest. To me, the book's too self-indulgent by far, so detailed it's a bore."
2,long winded,"Long winded and packed with irrelevancies. For example, the chapter on ochre describes the use of ochre in the social and religious practices of aboriginal australians in excruciating detail. The chapter on red goes on at length about carmine derived from cochineal bugs but gives scanty mention of the large number of red pigments available as a result of modern chemistry."
3,Rambling,"The author rambles about her travels more than explains any technical history of colours. Maybe I bought the wrong book; I was looking for an explanation of how colours are made. While not altogether boring, the stories around colours are not very enlightening."
2,Waste of time,"THis books seems to be a great footage of rock articles. IT presents no definitive theory about the rock industry, nor it gives a real portrait of the rock scenario through the years. It only gives separeted pieces of histories about Springsteen, Buffalo Springfield, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Peter Frampton, Grateful Dead, MC-5 and a handful of others. The writing style is dry and badly developed. DOn't recommended."
4,liberty hardware coat hat hooks,the hooks have a very nice finish they are well packed and price is very goodi recommend the item to anybodykaren
1,Lame!,I was very disappointed in this book. The plot seemed to stall from beginning to end. The characters were very bland and the story was too far-fetched.
3,not the best Swyteck book,"This is not the best ""Jack Swyteck"" book I have read, and I have read them all. BUt I would definitely give it a read, although it is a bit slow at times, it does end with a bang. If you like Grippando's writing you will still like this book."
5,Yuen Kay-San Wing Chun Kuen,"This is an excellent book on a rare form of Wing Chun. Very meticulous in the instructions given. In my opinion, this may even be superior to Ip Man's version of Wing Chun. Having practised martial arts for the past 18 years, I fell in love with this style of Wing Chun."
1,Pure Mexican Immadurity,"this is for immature people, this music is for immature such as Roberto Gomez Bola√±os faceGROW UP dont waste your smart hears in this stuff"
5,Pat Green keeps true to his roots,I was excited to see that Pat Green was releasing his first cd on a major record label. It has a combination of his old favorites and some new songs which are sure to become favorites in the future. The new songs all stay true to the Texas music sound that we have come to expect from Pat Green. My new favorites from this cd are Three Days and Who's to Say.
3,good record,"When I first read about Pat Green, he was refered to as Guy Clark lite i.e. someone who is trying to mine the authentic Texan vein of song story lines. And its true that at times Pat can get so enamored with writing about the myth of the unending Texas party that it can be tiresome. However at his best on songs like ""Three Days"", ""Carry On"", and ""Threadbare Gypsy Soul, "" it becomes clear that he is the real deal.IMHO he is one of the folks who has been hurt by the development of the cd and the requirement for more songs to fill the available time. If this was the 35-43 minute album of 20 years ago it would be a country classic"
4,Can't wait any longer,"in fact, i've been waiting for two years. i got a chapter in it. hope it will not be disappointing! i am curious to see otherp people's works too!"
2,HORRIBLE MOVIE;BEAUTIFUL ACTRESS,"Being a Dominique Swain fan, I decided to check this horror title out!This is a horrible movie and the ONLY positive thing about it is the fact that Dominique Swain plays in it!If you're a fan...watch Lolita instead!!"
4,Amazing Cd From Mr.Cheeks,"I just finished listining to Mr.Cheeks debut album, and it is certanitly worth the money. The best songs on it are,Mama Say,Bump Heads,Worldwide Bounce and Til we meet again. All the other songs are just as good though. This Album is definitly one of the best ones to come out this year. Definitly buy this one."
3,Very basic,"I'm glad it wasn't very expensive. It isn't helping me become a full fledged vegetarian. Quite spare. The cleansing diet in there is terrible! I tried it for almost 2 days and I was having an out-of-body experience, along with a horrible headache! There are a few good recipes in there, but not many are full meal recipes, and are very basic. I make up better recipes myself on the fly."
3,Still seems daunting,"I like this recipe book, but quite frankly the way it is all presented, it is anything but quick and easy becoming a vegetarian. There is much to learn and this book does provide that. I was thinking when I ordered this book that it would give you straight forward, easy meals that were quick to prepare. There is nothing quick about learning what food to buy and the proper way to prepare them as far as I can see with this book."
4,Vegetarian on the Go,"Turned into a perfect gift for my daughter-in-law who works full time, and is DEFINATELY a vegetarian. She loves to cook, but often finds therecipes limited in her lifestyle. Thanks for calling this book to my attention. ~MLM~"
3,Go Saddle the Sea is predictable,Go Saddle the Sea is about a boy called Felix. It is quite exciting but predictable. A dying servant gives him a package. He cannot make out what the writing on a piece of paper is...
1,Age Spot Formula and eb5 Facial Cream,"After 8 weeks of using both of these products, I see no lightening of age spots os any change in tiny wrinkles in my skin.I took a ""before"" photo to compare.HOW long do I have to use these products to see even a tiny improvement?"
4,Power Metal at it's finest!,"What Hammerfall does is write good tunes. They are solid in every respect. Vocally they rock, instrumentally they rock, production wise they rock. It just always sounds good and that's what you want if you're going to be spending your hard earned dollars on cd's.This is yet again another masterpiece. Theirs really not much to say about it, after all it's sounds like it's supposed to and that means it's as good or better than anything else they've ever done.If you like these guys or power metal in general?, pick it up as you wont be disappointed!"
3,"Nice, easygoing music; great for relaxation","Normally, I steer clear of music like this (Ray Lynch is the only exception). But positive word-of-mouth made me look into it, and I wasn't disappointed. I normally prefer more upbeat music, but this is a perfect tonic for a bad day. Most of the tracks flow easily, violin and ensemble perfectly complemented by appropriate use of flutes and vocal highlights. The album is mostly sedentary, though a couple of songs--""Stella Maris"" and ""Heaven and Earth""--are gently upbeat. Good for relaxation and comtemplation/meditation."
1,The Very Best of Angie Stone,Well I'm having trouble viewing it on my dvd player. I need a better copy
4,Fun with Feud,"We used this game for a family reunion... and if your family is fun, the game is going to be fun. (My brother was doing weird Richard Dawson imitations, etc.) The game works like the TV show. It would be nice to have some buzzers for the competition rounds- but we just had people raise their hand for that part of the game. We added our own sound effects as needed. There are plenty of questions in the game and even the younger kids were wanting in on the silliness. It was a good purchase."
2,blah,kind of fishy tasting with a few potatoes floating in it along with a few green herbs not worth the price... its not awful but not great either
4,Not very chowdery,"Unlike the December 2006 review, and much like the most recent reviews, there's not much in this soup, other than very small bits of seafood and some potato. I'm thinking that 1) the recent quality has gone downhill, or 2) the December 2006 review was a ""plant."" Anyway, the taste was okay, but it definitely doesn't rate up there with Legal Seafood (which I've had at one of the restaurants, and at the Boston airport, both much better than this)."
2,Not as the bottle shown,"It comes in the newer bottle that you find, the twist top. I wanted the bottle shown, trying to return it now."
4,Good Ink though price is going up every year.,There are two places I can find ink for my R2400 other than amazon. Adorama (which sells them in amazon) and Atlex.Both are almost the same as far as pricing except Adorama's shipping is free. Atlex is close to my studio so I can drive there if I want to pick up some ink or paper the same day if it is required.On a side note I hate that companies try to force you to upgrade and create landfills of these machines that work well. I had to run a special program to stop the printer from auto-stopping which Epson does to make sure the quality of it's prints doesn't diminish which is another way of saying that you need to throw away the machine and buy another. Planned Obsolescence in other words. I hope to continue using this printer for several more years. The price of ink has gone up every year and it used to cost $9 and now it's up to $13 per cartridge.
2,White residue everywhere!,"I bought these bubbles for my new puppies because my last dog loved bubbles. I got these and was kind of surprised to see that the flavor was peach, instead of bacon like the previous bubbles I got from another company. I started blowing them, and noticed that everywhere the bubbles land, they almost become plastic and leave a white residue. I was scratching it off my tv, off my dogs faces, it was everywhere! One of my dogs was terrified, the other one only had a small interest. I figured it should be an outdoor toy only."
4,"Puppy loves the bubbles, but bubble blower is too small for big ones.","I just received this yesterday and my puppy loves the bubbles. She liked chasing them and catching them...one landed on her nose. BUT, the little bubble blower in it is too small to make any big bubbles. I also got the replacement bottle of bubbles, but there is no blower inside...just the liquid. I think I'll go to a dollar store or someplace and try and find a bigger bubble blower...not bubbles...I like the fact that these don't pop of they stay in the air long enough....but I just would like a bigger, rounder bubble blower. I'll be getting these again IF I can find a bigger blower."
3,"Not for every dog, but works as described","My 12 year old and 1 year old dog were both terrified of these bubbles. The product, however, was as described. If you use these inside make a note of where they fall, because once they pop they leave sticky plastic-like residue behind. The bubbles didn't smell too great, either, at least to me. After about three months I noticed the bubbles no longer maintained their viscosity- they popped so easily they were hard to blow out of the wand."
2,getting smaller and easier to break,"I think newly purchased feathers are much shorter and narrower than I used to get; therefore, the toy does not fly well in the air and does not spin much. My cat likes hovering feather with spinning sound, but Da Bird refill cannot excite her any more. They are easy to break and I am disappointed. I prefer paying a few more dollars to get bigger, sturdier feathers so my cat can have fun with them."
2,Not as durable as the original,I had the original teaser end for my Da Bird toy for at least 3 or 4 months before it kicked the bucket. It was used daily for rigorous play session and it was quite durable. Thick and stiff feathers stood up to my very rough and tumble cat who flips 2-3ft off the ground to catch the toy.I got this in the mail and within 3 uses the first feather teaser was completely destroyed. The feathers were very light weight and flexible and my cat really just ripped them to shreds and broke them in half. This is our absolute favorite interactive kitty toy and i'm sad these died so quickly.I'm quite disappointed in the quality of these. DEFINITELY not worth the price for 3 uses for each teaser end.
2,disapointed,"What a disapointment!the book is not at all sufficient to operate small repair on leicas. it assumes too much knowledge and lacks step by step explanations and diagrams. I have found much more usefull dismantle description and repair instructions for free on the web. moreover, the subject treated are not systematic at all. restoration is treated on one camera, speed tuning on another. most of the pictures are useless as they descibe dismantle stages without showing the parts been discribed in the text for better clarity.This book is the output of someone who apparently is a good repairman but completely lacks any comunication skills."
2,No trouble shooting guide,I was hoping for a trouble shooting guide for a malfunctioning Leica IIIg. All this highly recommended book told me was how to disassemble the cameras.
1,big disappointment,I love mana. But their early sound is far different from their sound from at least six years ago. I will not recommend this cd unless you want to explore mana's roots; try their en vivo album instead--it's beautiful.
5,True fan......,"This CD is what we call an old school great. If you are a true fan of Mana and want a mix of latin rythms with rock en espanol, go for it. As for the people who believe this is not one of their better CDs, they must have jumped on the bandwagon at the wrong time or for the wrong reasons. Their following CD put them on the map, those after that, are still good CDs but lost some of its old school appeal. You can't blame them for trying to capture a different fan base. In either case, they are one of the best latin bands of all time and it appears they will continue to be for a long time."
5,The O'l days of music good music for my soul,"This production happens to be what brought me to life within my culture of celebrating life and happiness in all we do! It embodies all types of sounds to keep the flow fresh and upbeat. All of the sudden you are watching a clubbers classic called ""Circuit"" and you realize that a lot of the songs on this album are being featured in the movie.I love this album!"
4,The Fantastic World of Ivalice,"I was expecting that this game, which I played in my entire childhood, will be the one that will have no flaws and no errors, I was expecting the correction of every mistakes that it had on the PSX version, indeed they corrected the translation errors, but some sounds are synchronized to the attacks. The history of this game is amazing, It will be the 3 stars if I don't have this game as my favorite game of my chidhood."
5,Great Game,"I got this game a couple days ago and have been playing it all the time!I have to say this is the best game on PSP that I have ever played so far!Great story line, great customized scenes. Interesting battle system! Definitely a great RPG game!The only flaw I would say is the graphics of the battle still stays the same with games that are 10+ years old.Still quite fun to play! If you like RPG games, this is a great start!"
3,Great Player Who Complains Too Much About Everything In This Book,"I'm a huge Yankee fan and read a lot of books about the Yanks. I loved Graig Nettles as a player, but this book was a bit annoying for me. He complains and complains, non-stop. Everything is always an issue. He's not getting enough respect. He's better than this player or that player. He should be paid more. He can't stand George. He put all his thoughts out there in this book, which took a lot of guts... but reading his list of complaints gets boring and I came away from this book with a little less love for Nettles. Apparently so did the Yankees. He was no longer wearing pinstripes shortly after this book came out. I hate to say it, but he did it to himself. He comes across as a pretty selfish and self absorbed guy in this book. 3 out of 5 stars... He's still a great Yankee, but less great to me after reading his laundry list of complaints."
4,Adhesive bookplates,"Asian Birds and Flowers - Set of 20 Adhesive BookplatesThe print quality and colors are vivid and high quality. The pricing of the product itself is a good value, but paying equally as much for shipping was disappointing."
2,no fitting for inside faucets,Fill kits used to come with an attactment for an inside sink and the bed fitting. The inside fitting is for a hose end not a sink faucet. No way to fill the bed inside the house with this.
3,For the Low-Thrill-Threshold Crowd,"Pretty tepid stuff here. Nothing bad, but not much that really stands out. Every song starts out very promising, with a thumping dance beat, but quicly bogs down in a mushy 1980's dance mix (you know, the multitracked, high pitched female vocals, and synthesizers layered so deep they bury the rhythm tracks).There's better stuff out there for both dancing and listening: this one is for the over-the-hill dance clubbers. The biggest ""thrill"" here is the photography on the cover."
5,the second wave is here,"Think new order, the faint, or the magnetic fields. Synth Pop is back. This cd is incredible. The only reason you probably haven't heard this band is because no major label has signed them. This is some of the catchiest and wittiest music out today. Highly recommended"
