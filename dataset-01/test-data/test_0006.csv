1,Worthless!!,"This kit is a ""universal"" kit therefore you will need to modify it! Don't waste your time or money with this kit. It was to wide and tall for my 95 Camry and nothing fit correctly, the radio cannot be mounted to the adapter at all and just sits there, I purchased mine on ebay for 25 and it came with the wiring harness adapter so I did not have to cut my factory harness, that worked good but for this kit just stay away."
5,Operation Condor (1990),"This is a confusing situation. now ""Operation Condor"" is also known as ""Armour Of God 2: Operation Condor"" whilst ""Operation Condor 2: The Armour Of The Gods"" is also known as ""Armour Of God"". Why is this? Well Armour Of God 1+2 was their original title but Armour 2 came out before Armour of God 1 and so Armour of God 2 was named Operation Condor. a Great film!"
3,"Humorous and exciting, but pulling for laughs in parts.","Jackie Chan displayed his fantastic prowress and ability for humor in this film as much as in his others, but some supporting characters seemed to drag the movie down with their ""melodramaticism"", their lack of ability to execute lines at the precise moment, and their unconvincing acting. One thing you may wish to look into is : You advertize this video at ""PG-13"", whereas it is found in video stores as ""R"". If this is a mistake that you can remedy, you may wish to do so."
4,.,"One of the better Jackie Chan movies of the 90s. As usual, the cheesiness and humor are nearly excruciating, although often amusing, and the hand-to-hand sequences are plentiful, inventive, and energetic. The ""big stunt"" climax in this one is a fight in a giant wind tunnel, and it's far more entertaining than some of the ""big stunt"" finales of films like Rumble in the Bronx, Supercop, and First Strike."
3,Good Movie but not great...,"I remember seeing this film in the theater with my brother and not really getting into it until the wind tunnel scene and the outtakes... The wind tunnel scene was awesome! If the guy wasn't wearing wires, you could swear that he was really flying like Superman! Other then that the movie seemed to keep showing nude ladies behinds... I bought the film for the wind tunnel sequence... I will never get tired of watching that sequence..."
3,Dated,"Maybe when it came out this was seen as a good and original film, but now I think it is dated. Better films on similar topics like Inception are available. This struck me more as kids film.A top-secret project to manipulate people's dreams is launched, and our reluctant hero joins the project.The story itself is for movie is satisfactory. The dialogue is also passable. The characters are clearly stereotyped. The special effects are fairly ordinary by today's standards. The filming is ordinary.The acting is good.I would say it was more a kid's movie then an adult."
5,Long Before Inception,"Along with older sci-fi films like Brainstorm this movie is the birth of the modern movie Inception and for the time more interesting. When I watched this as a teenager, i found it more interesting than when I watched Inception as an adult."
4,Thriller.,"Reminds me of some of the dreams, the few I can remember, that I've had. Spooky, and a bit frightening."
5,Great Cast and Movie,"I watched this movie a dozen times so far, and really enjoy it. Based in the 1970's George Jung (Depp) and Tuna head out to California to find themselves in the thick of a drug infused environment. The two east coast guys find themselves in Derek Foreal's eccentric salon discussing how they want to sell pot. Eventually George Jung becomes the name to buy from at that time and expands. He eventually is selling Coke to all the people of California in the late 70's and becomes the king pin of coke in California. Based on a true story George Jung and Pablo Ecobar go through a lot of rough patches together after meeting in prison.I found this movie to be quite entertaining. The cast is very good and work very well together. This is one of my favorite movies because it is a funny and entertaining movie. The movie itself is has a good plot and has its ups and downs. All in all a very good movie and worth the money on BluRay."
5,Awesome,"The movie is not necessarily what I expected from the previews-but it rocked. As an added bonus, the good guy (if that is what you can call George Jung) didn't win, which always causes a thumbs up."
4,Good,"This was a good movie showing a small part of the history of the drug trade in America. I was expecting more action, i.e. shoot outs, ext. Even without the action I thought this movie was still very enjoyable."
3,DEPP strikes again !!,"Johnny Depp continues his tradition of not selling out completely to the mainstream and making movies that are, at the least, intriguing. BLOW is a good movie, technically very well-crafted, not overlong, not indulgent. Of course I don't care the least about JUng's final destiny, I hope he rottens in jail. Penelope Cruz is the only weak actor performance here. All in all, a good movie without purpose."
3,Break out the Bengay,"Ok, we're all getting older, but as much as I love Paul Hogan, this film was not a good script for him. It needed to be a bit less ""Obi-Wan"" (if members of my generation can follow) and a little more ""Die Hard"". Funny moments (""G'day Wendy! they'll be six of us for dinner tonight."") dampened by a tired plot and a weak ending. C'mon mate, we love ya'! Give us some action! This film was anticipated by a lot of folks who will think twice if they see a ""part four"" advertised."
4,Much better than expected !!,"Crocodile Dundee II was terrible, nowhere near the class of the origin Crocodile Dundee. The third one arrived 13 years later. I would say it is way too late for a sequel. So it didn't do well at all the box office. But surprisingly the third one is much better than the second one. The story about Mick Dundee visited LA only to discover a Hollywood film company is smuggling expensive paintings from former Yugoslavia. It is quite funny and with quite a few of one liners. George Hamilton and Mike Tyson appear as cameo. The DVD itself is good. Excellent picture transfer and the Dolby 5.1 is OK. Worth at least a rental."
1,Not the Buddy Holly I know and love,"My husband bought this CD for me during a recent visit to the UK, and I don't like it. I'm a Buddy Holly fan, but sound quality is poor, and it doesn't compare to his later recordings in terms of arrangements and singing style. Not my cup of tea."
2,Great Book. Bad copy of the book.,"I hate to rate a Burroughs book so low. I've been a fan of his works for a very long time. However, this version of the book is incomplete. The previous reviewer stated the book jumped right into the action with no back story. That is because this version is missing the first several pages. I happened to have two versions on my Droid Kindle app. and accidentally switched to this version after starting the other. The other version is the complete Mucker trillogy for $0.99. Well worth the price for three very good books.If you want free, this version of the book will stand on it's own minus the back story, but if the back story is important to you, get the full version."
5,Short and sweet,"I will keep this short as I totally agree with the other reviewers, but just let me say that this album is raunchy, gritty, and conveys raw pain like no other record I can think of. I don't often play air trumpet but""Right Off"" makes me!"
4,right off funking rules,"right off kicks off with billy cobham, michael henderson, and john mclaughlin dropping some serious southern rock blues no wonder folks could'nt tell if this was jazz or rock miles delivers also and herbie hancock does one of his wickeder solo's if you like long instrumentals from outer space this is for you rest in peace miles. miles fans who prefer the fusion period should definetly purchaes this."
5,Amazing scholarship,"John Roth has presented an exhaustive amount of research on Little People in a scholarly and yet available and easy-to-use volume. It is a great resource, and quite helpful in research on this subject. Hard to find, but worth looking for, as it is a unique and valuable tool."
2,They don't crash in Alaska!!,"The video box says they crash in Alaska, but in the movie they say they are crashing near Tumbler Ridge, which is in British Columbia. They say it is North-North-East of Edmonton, but it is North-North-West. This movie is so full of holes!! The plane comes to a rest half off a cliff, but no other scene shows the cliff. They drive from B.C. to Niagara Falls for the (quite awesome) bridge scene, in a few hours. A guy falls several hundred feet during an avalanche, while moments before he was in a wooded valley. The snow comes and goes. People arrive out of nowhere. The bear eats two humans in as many days. The movie box also says it is a chemical weapon, but it is a mind controlled weapon, with what seems to be electro-magnetic parts. The only chemical is there to destroy the machine. This movie is a good one to watch to see how many holes you can find! It doesn't take much to find them. Treat must be nearing the end of his career."
1,It's Hysterical!,"This is probabaly one of the worst movies I've ever seen, although it was good for a laugh - some of the lines are too funny - too bad it's suppose to be a drama. Anyway, if your in to terrible acting, snow making machines, bad writing and bad editing then this is for you. It was so bad it was funny."
4,Strangely Depressing,"While I loved the book and its concepts, it left me feeling rather depressed about the characters. It was written well and really got the author's philisophical views across, developing characters well."
4,Very good,"This chilling, first-person account of a man who struggles with his sense of guilt and innocence (and indifference) probably defines the existential novel. ""The Stranger"" is a small, bare story about big feelings in our complex world."
5,A haunting insight into the prevailance of injustice,"At first this was just one of those books assigned to read during tenth grade English. The sheer immediacy of the tale changed that. This book is philosophical to the hilt, questioning the general concept of reality itself. The reader begins to mistrust everything, especially government rule and its version of justice. A true revolutionary novel and one of the best written, ever, hands down."
5,Absurd,"Absurd. That's all I say about the world after reading this novel. If you read between the lines well enough, you'll begin to see why the world is so absurd. How society is absurd, how people pretend to live life to its fulllest when in fact they are living like dead people. Justice,society, people: it's an absurd world we live. This is a MUST read for anyone who has read The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, and to anyone with an open-mind about the world."
5,Sophomore Opinion,This book was very misleading but always interesting. I wouldn't recommend this book for sophomores because the material is mature and has more meaning behind it than a teenager can comprehend.
3,Had to read for class,"The book starts out a little slow, but starts to build quickly. I have had to read far worse books for class. I probably wouldn't read it again."
4,a stunning portrayal of alienation...,"....and the problem of living with fidelity in an alienated and ""absurd"" world. The first line is not to be forgotten for its evocation of numbness."
4,This book will make you think,"This is the first book I read by Camus and it inspired me to read more. If you like books with lots of plot and little introspection this is not for you, but it is the short plot that makes it more interesting I think. Mersault lives in an algerian town in the 1940s and this book describes his life and a crucial event in it. The point of the book was to show us how our actions and thoughts are dominated by society's expectations. In it Mersault is presented both as a conscious human being whose actions we (as him) understand but also as the monstrous figure he presents himself as to society, re: attitudes to his response to the death of his mother, the way in which he treats Marie. I was struck by this book because not only could I see myself in Mersault re his sensualism, and selfcentredness, but also by the way in which I as part of society condemn the actions of others.It is a simple book to read, but one which will make you think, so I recommend you try it."
5,"Challenging, but worth my time!","This book is very easy to read, but very hard to read well. It was amazing!"
3,Not all its cracked up to be,"The only part that is worth mention is the simple manner in whcih Camus writes... the message is somewhat worthwhile. The reason i became engrossed in it was because I expected it to become better, but it never did. My advice:DON'T START READING IT EXPECTING TO BE A MASTERPIECE!"
5,Translation not as strong as previous ones.,"_The Stranger_, of course, is worthy of five stars. The translation of it is not; Stuart Gilbert's translation of the _L'Etranger_ is worthy of five stars."
4,Deserves A Second Read...Deep,"I have often heard that in a translation, part of the story is lost. I could not help feeling this as I was reading this book. Although I feel as though I have missed a few things in Camus' message, the novel offers interesting (and sometimes bizarre) insights on certain subjects such as death, love, and religion. The grotesqueries in the book are often behind great thought, and because I read this in a day, a deeper analysis of the book might help in understanding some of Camus' intents. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quick (but long lasting in thought) reading."
3,"""Poetry is that which gets lost in translation.""","My mediocre rating is for the translation - not for the novel (which is magnificent). Matthew Ward's humdrum translation makes me prize all the more the original, Stuart Gilbert, translation, which I grew up with and which became so indistinguishable from Camus' own voice. Ward is an American, which is somehow an explanation for his nondescript prose. Robert Frost, who penned the title of this review, was also an American, capable nonetheless of writing slendidly and evocatively. I know that Camus tried to flatten out his prose, but I cannot believe it's as flat as Ward's."
4,bit odd...,"I found it a little weird because when I was looking for the copy of this book on this site and I was looking for the specific cover that has black ""zebra"" stripes on white. But I got the different cover instead and with few weird piece of papers being left behind, but thats okay as long as it is still in good condition and same writings as the other book."
3,I finally read the classic,The Stranger by Albert Camus was an interesting read and very thought provoking. It didn't leave me in a particularly good mood after reading it because of the nature of the novel and its subject matter. I sympathized with the main character. It's a wild ride of absurdity and enjoyable if you're in the mood for a philsophizing and thinking.
5,It's my favorite novel,I read its Korean version and I bought English version.The title was different(The outsider) but no problem with it.
2,highly over-rated but intriguing short novel,"Though Camus is an exceptional prose stylist he is no thinker and this is never more clear than in The Stranger. Walter Kaufmann has noted the general vacuity of Camus' thought in his (Kaufmann's) prolific criticism on existentialism. Philip Freund, in his meticulously long essay ""Albert Camus and Symbolism"" (in The Art of Reading the Novel) has convincingly demonstrated the alarmingly weak structural integrity of much of Camus' fictional work. I recommend The Stranger as an experiment, as it incidentally yields some intriguing insights; but I qualify this recommendation as, architectonically (inclusive of plot execution, coherence of symbolism, philosophical cogency) The Stranger, largely, is a failure."
1,This book was mediacator,I thought this was a very UNREALISTIC BOOK. I thought was written very poor.
2,I Got an A+ On My Paper - But I Hated It,"I read this book in High School and I hated it. Even to my young 17 year old brain, the concepts of philosophy seemed ludicrous. I guess I must have understood them on some basic level, because like I said, I got an A. But it was a shock to me as well! I understand why a book like this is in an Honors English class. It may be more interesting in the original French."
1,bad translation,"Please let shoppers know who the translator is. It makes a difference. If you want the classic Stranger, don't buy this edition. This is translated into ""American."""
3,Skip it,"I read this book because I found a reference to it as something relating to existential philosophy. I currently understand existential philosophy as a doctrine that views man as responsible for his being, for his nature and every act he performs.The main character throughout the novel shows his indifference to everything. He is responsible for everything but yet he does not care? Surely it won't make any difference to the universe, but it will make a difference to him, which is all that matters.I for one did not find the book amusing."
2,Read Old Magic Instead,I had read the book Old Magic which is by the same author and I loved it. Then I read this one and I felt very sad. The characters feel like they have no depth to them. The story moves along slowly and painfully. I suggest that every one read Old Magic and spare themselves from this aweful book.
1,Wrong Book sent.,"Sent me the 1986 version, not the one pictured. It was only volume 1 also which only covered words starting with the letters A-G."
1,"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged","The first three items I checked were not in this dictionary. I don't like the way they credit everyone who has a definition for a word. My daughter bought the one just under this one in price and it is a great source of word definitions. This is pretentious and a big disappointment.Jeanne MatthewsSeverna Park, Md., 21146"
1,Sent Wrong Item! Ordered 2002 edition/Sent 1986 edition!,I ordered a copy of this Dictionary that according to the site was published in June of 2002 for a local school spelling bee. I was sent an older copy of this dictionary that was published in 1986 that is too old to be of use in the spelling bee. I have written e-mail to the seller asking that he either send me the updated 2002 dictionary or refund my money and have not heard anything back yet! I hope that my school's students are not going to be dissapointed!
3,Bait and Switch,Amazon has a picture of three volumes and other reviews talk about a CD. What I got was a single volume and no CD. Buyer-beware and do not be in a hurry like I was.I wonder why I have never been disapointed with the private individuals (or tiny book stores) that sell through amazon?crs
5,Nice bracelet watch,"This functions like a bracelet and contains a watch when opened. It is attractive and practical, indoors or out."
2,fast-paced one-problem/one-solution approach,"Pournelle isn't a classic sci-fi author, though he has co-written some fine novels (with Larry Niven). So, naturally I was interested in reading a stand-alone novel by Pournelle. First I read Future History, which was a power-struggle based sci-fi novel. It bored me. Then I came upon Exiles to Glory and I thought Pournelle could justify himself.Unfortunate for me and for Pournelle, I thought this book was also a bore. It's pace is written like a golden age sci-fi novel in its ""fast-paced one-problem/one-solution"" approach. It was unflavored and the plot was jerky most of the time. It was so jerky that the holes in the plot are pretty easy to piece together yourself. This will probably be my last stand-alone Pournelle novel."
1,A Train Wreck,"This film really misses its mark. Billed as a black comedy, it fails to deliver any satirical bite whatsoever. Suzanne Stone's frequent video segments where she speaks directly to the camera and the flashforwards to some sort of Jerry Springer-like show are painful to watch. Yeah, Nicole Kidman is extremely sexy (duh), but it's not nearly enough to overcome her marginal acting, the clumsy dialog and the amateurish direction.See this movie for all the humor of ""Dying Young"" coupled with the social commentary of a SpongeBob episode."
1,should have been ceramic for what it cost,"The thing is plastic. Very expensive for plastic. I would NOT have gotten it if I had known it wasn't ceramic. I needed a flat round ceramic ""platter""."
5,A slow read,"Reading this book will require some time because of the transcription and content. Carl Rogers made significant changes after his contact with Martin Buber. If you have only listened to the tapes or read previous transcriptions and you need to read this book. I think reading this book provided some insight regarding both men. I have been interested in Buber's philosophy and Hassidic Judaism, and this book has been helpful. I highly recommend this book for the serious reader or student, but take the time to let the words sink in."
1,What A Waste,"Don't waste your money-this is the least interesting book I have ever read. The essays are so badly written and many are so self-serving it is offensive (who is that half-wit Julie Gold?). I'm not sure how it's possible to make a boring book about John Lennon but this one succeeds. Too bad, it could have been great."
5,A delight for fans of Anita Harris!,"I have always loved this film as it features a surprisingly sexy belly dance by Anita Harris as the duplicitous Corktip. As a kid I was aware of Ms. Harris, as she often appeared on British TV in the sixties as a wholesome family singer. This film made me see her in a whole new light!"
2,Disappointing,"I love Conrad, so I was very disappointed when I read (or slogged through) LORD JIM. Conrad was heavily under the influence of Henry James when he wrote this book, and if you like Henry James, then you'll probably like this one. But, as Michael Crichton said about Henry James, ""I can't stand Henry James. His stuff reads like a first draft."" Conrad writes like Henry James here in that the sentences are eternal and convoluted, and take forever to make a point. And every little thing in LORD JIM is symbolic of...you name it: man's despair, etc. As I said, I love Conrad: HEART OF DARKNESS, NOSTROMO, his short stories. But I found LORD JIM a totally unwelcome change in his writing style, and it was pure tedium for me to make it to the last page"
4,Tasty!,"Good option for people too lazy to stand over a pan (like me)! I got this as a birthday present, and I use it all the time. The Hello Kitty faces don't always come out perfectly, but you can still kind of make out features- the sandwiches otherwise always come out good. Plus the sandwich maker itself is a Hello Kitty face!"
4,Fascinating but exhausting,"This book was very different from Exupery's Little Prince which was more fast-paced and concise. This book has beautiful language and vivid imagery which makes the reader feel like they are in the pilot's seat. However, long-winded descriptions of circumstances, no matter how great they are, are quite tiresome when they go on for pages at a time. If you've got good concentration and mental energy, you'll love this book. I can only read 10 or 15 pages at a time before I get tired. Otherwise, I enjoy the book very much, and I love the wisdom Exupery offers in every page."
2,Very Average Film!,this Film had a Promising Name List but it doesn't Make it all the way through.the Jokes just didn't Hit Home for Me Fully.The Story Line was just kinda there.it wasn't as Deep as it could have been for Me Personally.Very Average Film Overall.
3,A Good Book,This book is good for a beginner because it gives you a more philosophical view of being in a sub/dom relationship. It stresses safety when playing. The writer is an experienced dominant who expresses himself well. It is a good companion book to SM 101.
3,this shouldn't be your first book on the lifestyle,"This book has some very good information and the author is very experienced in all things S&M but the lack of photos and/or diagrams is very disappointing. Trying to learn about decorative bondage from text on paper is ridicules, and the knots illustrated won't do much good to a novice unless they are shown in the context of actually restraining someone. I would strongly recommend ""screw the roses send me the thorns"" or ""sm 101"" as a first book."
4,Well...I liked it,"All the complaints - Hey...it's only one book.And face it...Fagen is the voice of Steely Dan ; he's gonna get a bit more attention than Becker. I enjoyed it, I learned a lot and it was entertaining. What more could I ask for for $4.50?"
4,Sign in Stranger,"This book is a keeper for any Dan Fan. Contrary to some of the other reviews here, I would like to have learned even more personal information about the ""mystery men"" behind, in my humble opinion, the ""Coolest Group Ever."" Their lives and personal relationships, when not involving their music, is glossed over, almost as an afterthought. It was interesting, however, to get a glimpse of what in the world some of their songs are really about and how my original interpretation differed. This book may be, in some respects, a lightweight. But for the true-blue Dan Fan, it's the only game in town."
3,Where DID you get those shoes?,"This book is compelling reading for the serious Steely Dan fan. However, one must take it with a grain of salt, as the dynamic duo weren't involved in the book project at all. The mystique of Becker and Fagen represent part of their attraction, after all, and their legendary reclusiveness permeates this book. This reader noted a few glaring errors in grammar, and perhaps typos, but considering it's British authoring, it may be correct as far as the King's English goes. A good read nonetheless...I am glad I read it, however, as it seems to answer some of the nagging questions all Dan fans ask. Buy it with confidenc, but don't expect too much."
4,A forgotten mystery,"I found this book at an antique store for $2.00, and bought because of the very dramatic cover and because I like mysteries from the 30's. The story itself is well written and reflects the time and language of 1930's America. The descriptions and characters are exaggerated but fun to watch. The detective is not a superbrain. He is a regular person thrown into the position of solving the murder. If you like old time mysteries with strange characters living in a strange big house with secrets and plot twists- this book is for you. The book is best visualed in black and white."
1,"Re-Releasing ""An Evening With John Denver"" under a different title!","If you already own ""An Evening with John Denver"" (five star album) then you don't need this one! The same program (exactly) has been repackaged with a new title and cover...less the two best songs! ""Boy From The Country"" and ""Today""...the original is fabulous but why do it again?!?!?"
4,Sam's Letters to Jennifer,"I really enjoyed reading this book by James Patterson. He really gets into the characters, writing from the women's perspective and really making the reader feel they know the people in the story as well as ache for the protagonist.The only issue I have with this book is, even though there are multiple facets or stories entwined here, is how one is ended with just one line in regards to what happens to Sam. Since a large part of the book centered around Sam and Jennifer, and their relationship, I felt that that parqagraph should have been more than one line.Just one reader's thought."
1,A waste of time,"I loved ""Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas"" and was hoping that Mr. Patterson would again engage me in a really good story, even if it brought me to tears. That didn't happen here. Instead, I found this book filled with every possible cliche and circumstance, as tho he'd created a list of every imaginable sad scenario, and checked them off as he worked them into this novel. Young, beautiful woman widowed....then a miscarriage...now a beloved grandmother in a coma, with her own life's story to tell via letters....and then a new boyfriend dying of cancer. C'mon! It is so far beneath his talents for a good story, that I can't imagine why he would take the time to write it......unless he simply enjoys laughing all the way to the bank. I read it in less than 2 hours...hoping that he would redeem himself and make it worth my while. Didn't happen."
4,SAMS LETTERS TO JENNIFER,"I LOVED THIS BOOK - I READ A LOT OF MURDER MYSTERIES, AND I LOVE PATTERSON, BUT NOW AND THEN I LOVE A GOOD ROMANCE NOVEL, AND I LOVED THE WAY THE STORY UNFOLDED WITH THE LETTERS FROM THE GRANDMOTHER - MADE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU KNEW ALL OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED AND WERE PULLING FOR THEM IN EACH OF THEIR OWN STORIES. THANKS JAMES PATTERSON - I LOVE THE WAY YOU WRITE."
4,A tear-jerker...,"I thought this was a really nice story. I read it in one sitting, but it was sooo sad. Make sure you have a box of tissues! The setting (Lake Geneva) sounded beautiful. The only problem I had with this book was that it seemed a little rushed. I felt there could have been so much more as far as the actual letters to Jennifer. I figured that'd be the majority of the book, but Sam's story was only a small part.Regardless, it was sweet, and it definitely has been drilled into my head that Jennifer is ""the most beautiful girl in the world""...(it got a bit old after a while). Anyway, aside from the few small downfalls this book has, I do recommend it. It's a great summer story."
5,Moving,"I am a huge Alex Cross fan and have avoided any other of Patterson's books. This CD was loaned to me so I felt obligated to listen and what a surprise. I am not normally affected by books, tapes or movies, but this one was so well written and read that I found myself deeply caring about the characters involved. This book might not be very original - but well worth your time."
3,Good book!,"First off, I love James Patterson anyway, but I really liked this book. It wasn't as good as Suzannes Diary for Nicholas, but it was definitely worth reading. This book moves really quickly and doesn't take long to read at all. I read it in 2 short nights. Sometimes it's nice to have a quick read after you've finished a long book. I thought the characters in this book were great and people you truly felt comfortable with. It was a sad book, but had a good ending that I was very happy with. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."
5,Not intended for die hard mystery fans,"This book is for those sappy at heart. Those who enjoy love in its my simplistic form. A very easy read; or maybe it was just the fact that I couldn't put the book down. I would never have read James Patterson if it was not for Suzanne Diary; and this the second book I have read by him- could possible leave a spot on my soul forever. If your looking for mystery, murder and intrege, your reading the wrong book. If you are looking for ""my life isn't all that bad"" and something to make you live life a little more ""from sunset until you can't keep your eyes open."" this book is for you!!"
2,Blah,"The only reason this book was enjoyable was because you could read it in one sitting. The chapters were short, unchallenging, and the storyline didn't require much thought.The story felt rushed, and I didn't feel like I got to know the characters very well. I thought there were too many different dramatic things happening at the same time which kept shifting the focus of the story. Throughout the book I was wondering why Jennifer wasn't spending more time with Sam. I also wondered why we weren't told more about Brendan and Jennifer's childhood together.I don't read many James Patterson's books and this one didn't inspire me to pick up another one anytime soon."
4,Sams Ltters to Jennifer ( Patterson James ),"Extemely refreshing, will capture your interest as Patterson always does. Easy reading that stirs the inner fellings of love we all harbor for one another."
1,Why?,"It is inconceivable that this book would have been printed without the reputable name of James Patterson as author. The plot is simple, the word choice adolescent and the characters are flat and similar; Jennifer is the same as Sam and Brendan is the same as Daniel. I don't take lightly to slamming another writer, yet it is difficult not to when coming across sentences such as these:""I was soooo glad to see Brendan's smiling face.""""...less than three weeks later, something really terrible happened.""""...my eyes were swollen and very, very red.""To use some of Mr. Patterson's own jargon, let me just say: This book is very, very bad. Soooo bad and really terrible."
1,Why is this tripe an NY Times Bestseller?,"Another book that is supposed to make you cry. But the only tears I shed were ones of boredom. The characters were bland, the plot schmaltzy and contrived and the writing just okay. I couldn't finish it."
2,This is Og Mandino at his worst,"This is a fast read, which continues to remind us that we should appreciate each day and those around us. Yes we should but I don't understand why Mr. Patterson wants to venture out of the genre that he excels in...mystery novels."
5,Even better than Suzanne's Diary!,"This book was so good, I read it in about 4 hours! I could not put it down. It was even better than Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas. It really touched me, this book I think touch's upon life that everything is not always perfect and you run into obstacle's once in awhile! But in the end something always turn out right! I hope that James Patterson will follow this pattern and have another book that is similar! We should all be so lucky to have a grandmother like Sam!"
3,A quick read but a good one....,"Mind you, this was my first James Patterson novel and compared to all the other reviews I have read I am sure there are other great books by him. I am now reading ""The Lifegaurd"" and so far it's great.Sam's letters to Jennifer was a good read. I read it in two sittings and it kept my attention the whole time. I thought it had a good story line and I enjoyed to two love stories.I believe the story could have been played out more. But you can tell it was a get to the point story. I wouldn't surprise me if Mr. Patterson wrote it over the weekend.I recommend this book to someone who is taking a long flight or isn't a avid reader - because it is such a good short read."
3,Engaging but not riveting,"Like many others I found this book disappointing compared with Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas (which I loved). The story held my interest, but only just. I thought the characters weren't particularly well developed but they were likeable and I cared what happened to them. Just not enough. Certainly, I didn't have to reach for the Kleenex.I did start to wonder, however, if James Patterson gets product placement fees for naming brands in his novels. Hmmm - food for thought."
1,"No Matter How Many Alphabet Letters are Used, it's Still Bad","Although it is not a sequel to Patterson's masterpiece Suzan's Diary for Nicholas, it is obviously a hastily put together piece trying to cash in on the success of that novel. It fails miserably in its ability to keep you turning the pages, the main character Jennifer is just not that interesting and you really couldn't care less if she makes it with old childhood friend Brendan who like all bad 'chick flick' type books is dying of a disease, in this case a brain tumour. The other main part of the story revolves around Jennifer discovering who the secret mystery lover was of her grandma Sam, who is lying in a coma whose letters Jennifer is now reading. The book is boring and predictable is a severe understatement. It is just not worth spending even one cent on. If you haven't read Suzan's Diary for Nicholas defiantly do so, but forget this rush job."
2,TOO SHORT!!!,"I have been a fan of James Patterson since Along Came a Spider...However, I have to agree with the few reviews I read that he has gone downhill. This book was a little over 260 pages, big type, with his usual short chapters that makes for an impossible to put down book. Needless to say, I was able to finish the book in less than 2 hrs!!! He could have gone into so much more depth on everything, including the letters that were written by Sam, which were an integral part of the book. I was extremely disappointed by the lenth and lack of substance for this book. That being said, if you want a quick read and happen to borrow someone else's copy or find it used, it's worth it, I guess. But it does not even begin to compare to Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas. Someone else mentioned not even bothering with Sam's and just rereading Suzanne's...I may have to agree."
3,NOT ALL ARE THE ORIGINAL SONGS! CONTAINS FAKES!,"MANY OF THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM ARE THE ORIGINALS BY THE ORIGINAL GROUPS, HOWEVER, SOME ARE NOT!IE: Little Darlin' The Diamonds - THIS IS NOT THE DIAMONDS!There are more, if you truly remember the original songs, you will be able to detect the fakes. The 'originals' are of good quality."
5,Only Doo-Wop Cd,Bought this for my husband. It's true- it's the only doo-wop anyone could want. He plays it continuously. I would highly recommend it to any doo-wop fan.
3,Doo Wop,The sound quality could be better overall it is a good CD if you like Doo Wop it is worth the purchase
4,The Only Doo-Wop collection you'll ever need,This is a fantastic overall collection of Doo-Wop groups/songs i have heard.This covers most of the variations of songs let alone the big hits of the day many years back
2,POINTLESS REMAKE,"Virtual scene-for-scene color remake of the 1968 classic, directed by FX wizard Tom Savini. George A. Romero co-wrote the screenplay, but all in all; apart from being bloodier than the original it is all pretty pointless and boring. I'm just grateful that they haven't done the same thing to DAWN OF THE DEAD."
2,Don't expect a classic.,"The thing that made the original Night of the Living Dead so great was that it was played straight and the characters was played realistic. This remake adds humor to the story and have the standard naive american view on people as either good or bad. One of the most interesting things with the original was that it showed that the hero became as evil as the monsters he fought against. This remake could be a winner, but turned out to be just another american horror film we don't care about. It's not that bad, it's just... nothing. We have just seen it hundreds of times."
3,Romero's Genius brought the Horror Genre to the 21st Century,"For a film that is widely considered a horror classic, ""Night of the Living Dead"" has been handled with surprisingly poor care in the home video market over the years.For the longest time, the film was generally only available on VHS copies that could often be found in the bargain bins of your local video store. The reason for the cheap price became apparent after viewing. The picture quality of many of these editions was so poor that viewing them made you feel as if you were watching the movie through dirty aquarium water.With the advent of DVD there have been ocassional first rate packages out there but more often than not the film was still mishandled. n if you've seen the film, countless times, watching this DVD is almost like viewing it for the very first time."
2,Are you kidding,"Are you kidding me? Tom Savini directed this. The master of special effects gore. This movie should be rated PG except for the language. There is no gore or blood. None. I'm not kidding. The original was edgier and gorier and that was 1968! I bought it because I love zombies and the Romero trilogy and Savini but let's be honest, the acting was horrible and the gore was nonexistent."
5,a very scary movie with great acting !,it's scary every time I see it. and a good but differet ending than the origional flick.
5,Classic Horror,"I've seen this movie many times in the past, and always thought it would make a great addition to my movie collection. Found it used here on amazon for a great price! it was deliverd quickly,and the dvd was in excellent to perfect condition! All around great deal, and would purchase again from this seller!"
3,good remake,"This is a good remake of the original 1968 classic. Its got good acting, good gore( not to much, not to little), good locations, and strong characters(especially Barbara, she was better here than in the original.) I didnt care for the ending too much though. All in all a good remake."
4,I LOVED IT!,I thought this version was just as good (if not a little better) as the first one. i loved how barbara kicked butt in this movie! im a big zombie movie fan and was so excited to get this DVD.
1,Night of the living dead -1990 remake,"I have not watched yet as i did not know that i cant watch movies from the U.K. here in the states! Lesson learned. Pass this info on, Please!!I have reordered and am waiting for arrival. I found it in Blue-Ray at a high cost. Only 3000 copies made! Will put post up when i watch it. Before halloween 2012."
2,Bloodless remake,"I couldn't believe how bad a zombie movie this was in the hands of the two people most associated with the Living Dead series. Romero's dialogue is awful, and isn't help by some of the terrible performances (esp. Tom Towles). What I was looking forward to was better special effects than the original due to the bigger budget. The fx sucks. The zombies are boring and the blood looks brownish (chocolate syrup again?) You'd think with Savini behind the camera, the effects would have played an important role in the film (ala Chris Walas' Fly sequel). But the zombie's look like a bunch of drunks. I know that this film had to be cut to get a R rating, but I've seen much gorier films from the 80s. I watched this movie for the second time after seeing Day of the Dead a few days before, and there's no comparison between this and Romero's superior film. And all you people who keep giving this movie 5 stars must have never seen a real horror movie before seeing this snoozefest."
2,It worked well while it worked,"Just like my title says, it worked just as it's supposed to until it suddenly stopped working. I am ordering both 64 oz bottle and a small squeeze bottle so I could keep refilling small squeeze bottle with the big bottle."
3,"Inspired, yes...but HARD to read aloud!","Honestly, I'm no read-aloud wimp! And my kids are usually up for anything. They giggled like mad at the pompous puns of Mr. H.M. Wogglebug T.E. in the Oz books, and urged on my faux-Yorkshire accent in the Secret Garden. The century-old Australian slang and endless sea shanties of the Magic Pudding, though, just about did us in. It really is a magnificent flight of fancy, but there were just too many incomprehensible sentences to paraphrase and longggg songs to make up tunes for. Save this for when you're at your most daring and energetic, read-aloud parents!"
4,Revival of rare Mercadante opera,"This Myto release---now out of print---presents a rare performance of Mercadante's IL REGGENTE, based losely on the same subject as Verdi's UN BALLO IN MASCHERA. The cast is headed by Maria Chiara, Giorgio Merighi, and the performance dates from 1970. The sound is clear mono, and the performance is very solid and music very agreeable. Sadly, this issue is out of print and hard to find, but it repays a search...to hear how Verdi's competitors fared during the 1840s."
3,Cute and Light,"""Someone Like You"" is cute and light, but basically it's a Meg Ryan movie without Meg Ryan, and boy is she missed. Ashley Judd does her best, but she's upstaged in every scene with co-star Marisa Tomei, who's far more appealing. Luckily the movie has a dashing leading man in Hugh Jackman. He makes the whole movie worth watching. It's not a bad movie. In fact it's just good enough for you to wish it were better. But, like I said, Marisa and Mr. Jackman are terrific and make it worth your time to watch. Enjoy!"
5,Pleasant Romantic Comedy,I found this movie to be very pleasant to watch. I enjoyed the humour and romance that starts somewhere different than you would expect. The entire cast seemed to blend into a heart warming film. I really enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone.
4,Totally cute,"This is a great little romantic comedy. Ashley Judd is adorable and Hugh Jackman and Greg Kinnear are perfect. The most hilarious part of the film is the fake psychologist Judd creates to put forth her comparison of humans to cattle, comparing man's polygamous mating drive to that of a bull. Some genuine laughs and a heartwarming romance. Recommended."
2,A Judd Miss,"Saw the film because, to date, have enjoyed all this Judd's films. Big disappointment.The opening of the film was promising. Thought I would be entertained with the ""cow"" theory. But the film went flat quickly and much time was spent bashing men (and their inability to be faithful to - or even desire only - one) throughout the film. 5-10 minutes of this would have been enough. But an entire film resting solely on this theme gets old.She's beautiful and interesting to watch on film, but even a date with a great man can't make up for this miss. I found myself cringing with each line and new scene dedicated to exploring this premise.The previews looked interesting, and like many comprise the only slightly funny moments in the film.I did enjoy the soundtrack, however...."
3,Someone Like You--Not as Good As I'd Hoped,"I bought this mainly because I'm a Hugh Jackman fan. Frankly, I was a bit disappointed. The movie is terribly ""chick-flick"" orientated, and the plot revolves around the insecurities of women who make foolish decisions (like sleeping with their egotistical bosses and convincing themselves it's true love). Ironically, Jackman plays the outright egotistical ""player"" and eventually ends up being the hero. I have to admit that whomever it was that came up with the ""old cow"" part of the plot had a zany sense of humor! It fits in with the insecurities of the lead character wonderfully! And, there were a few nice scenes of Jackman (New Year's Eve party, insomnia scene, and of course, the end). Would have been better had Jackman's character been more developed, in my opinion."
5,What the fans say:,"I don't know who the hell ""the critics"" are but the review above written by an aforementioned ""critic"" is hogwash. The Alarm is foot stomping good fun. The music is powerful, the lyrics are great. These guys aren't U2 nor do I think they wanted to be. These guys are as relevant to the music of their time as the Clash was to their's. My advice to all of you: Buy this album and hear a little bit of God whispering sweetness in your ear. My advice to the critics: Lighten up."
3,Comfy,"Since I live in flops, I was told that I can't go wrong with these. They are ok. I have been wearing for 3 months and they are not yet as comfy as my Nikes."
3,Good at first,"I liked these flip flops initially, but the light color really attracts dirst and you can't really clean them. They are very comfortable unless you wear them on a long drive the hemp canvas is abrasive to the bottom of feet after an hour."
2,Not worth it!,These look NOTHING like the picture. They are long and narrow and look like they came from a dollar store. Not worth the $33.00
2,Not the best....,The print is great but can not find more than half of the answers for my puzzles... Tried over and over and the book is one big failure...
3,WCW best of?,I have a lot of respect for WOW. Because they actually made WCW look like it actually put on an interesting show. WCW should hire the people from WOW to help them book.
4,14 Foreigner + 3 Lou Gramm = 1 good CD,"Made in AUS in 1999, Serial# 7567-80949-2, Playing Time 73:22This compilation features songs up to their ""The Very Best... And Beyond"" album (track 12). Foreigner sold millions of albums... If you listened to rock radio in the 80's you know (probably by heart) half of the songs on this CD.I am somewhat puzzled by the track selection: I can think of at least great 40 songs to put on a CD, but they wouldn't all fit; so why choose 3 from Lou Gramm? I would have preferred a 2-disc set with 1 disc of ballads, 1 disc of rockers.I'm not sure why anyone would buy this: I would have left out some of the songs to leave room for some others. Maybe some of those were very popular in Australia, where this disc was made.If you don't own most of their albums, get ""The Very Best... And Beyond"" instead; and shame on you for missing out on these icons of the 1980's."
1,NOT a self help book!,"Author is utterly self-involved and the book is not helpful by any means. If you want to spend your time in someone else's dreamland, go ahead. But if you're looking to gain some self-understanding, or any insight at all, look elsewhere!I consider this book to be false advertising."
2,Not widescreen,"I've been looking for the widescreen DVD of this film to add to my collection. Although this product was listed as widescreen, it was not. Still a good flick, but out of place in my collection..."
3,Michael is a fantastic actor but the service needs improvement,"I obtained this via amazon's instant video streaming. I like the idea of being able to not have to have the disc for every movie under the sun, but sometimes the connections get lost causing some lag time -- I just wish I could down load the movie to my personal large drive so that I don't have to worry about it.As for the movie -- you can't NOT watch it if you like M. J. Fox's films and t.v. work."
2,could have been better.,"i liked the film good story fun bunch of colorful people, but now the down side the bad nudity for one & lauguage for another. minus those things it's a great picture, when i saw it on television i love it the edited version aka airline cut so if you get a chance to see on tv than i recommend doing so personally i think that's the way it should have been released in movie houses in the first place. but if you still want this version i'd recommend that people over the age of 13 can see this. parents may want to view this film first before letting your family watch this. i know i'm old fashioned but it better to be safe than sorry if you know i mean. i would actually buy the edited version of this one."
2,Doc Hollywood,I was disappointed with the nudity in the movie---I guess the version I had originally seen and enjoyed was edited for tv---I had to throw the dvd I bought in the trash---guess I need to be more careful about what I buy.
3,DVD a big cost for little return,I love Pinocchio but it is not worth paying the extra cost for this DVD just because it is Disney. There are NO extra features except trailers. How disapointing that Disney feels they can charge 10 or more dollars extra just for the priviledge of owning this on DVD. It feels like they are punnishing us for not buying the video which has more extra features on it then the DVD! How sad. I would not buy either and complain to Disney about their sneaky tactics! I am a huge Disney fan and can say this!
5,The Jewel of the Disney Animated Crown,"Mary Poppins is the greatest Disney film ever made, but if your looking for Uncle Walt's greatest animated classic, this is the film. Pinnochio is superbly written, animated and designed. It's an exiting, dark and detailed picture with charming characters and wonderful lessons.It's a shame that Disney has not decided to make this part of their ""Platnium Edition"" collection. It surely has more merit than The Lion King. It's a great film!"
1,NO EXTRAS!!!,"This is really the pits. Disney could easily put a few little ""extras"" on these DVD releases, like ""the making of..."", interviews, etc. But all we get is the bare movie. This sucks. How much more could it cost to add these extras? Virtually every other DVD released nowadays has added features. Shame on you, Disney."
3,disney movie classic,I got this movie for my kiddos to watch. I was a little surprised by 2 of the scenes in the movie that I don't remember from when I was a child. One in which there is smoking of cigars and the use of a sensitive word. Yet overall is a classic that I remember from my childhood.
4,great movie,i would have given five stars but it didn't come with outer sleeve... didn't say it didn't or anythingotherwise fantastic and very happy with purchase
3,There's a Better Way,"If you like long, tedious introductions and the need to sort through endless words to find what you're looking for, then you might want this version of Euclid's work. On the other hand, if you want to get to the point and prefer a clear resource for study, the version published by Green Lion is FAR superior to this one."
3,More Fashionable than Functional,"This is a nice looking hat, and fairly comfortable. However... I'd rate this as a light duty hat more suited for temps in the 30-45 range. Why? The ties are only 6"" long at the stitch points which means that you have about 5.5"" to tie a knot with. Unless you are an Eagle Scout, or are a very deft weaver, this is just too short. Your ears are basically at the mercy of the wind. This is not an issue if the temperature is above 30 since it is not that cold, but I wore it in MA during a recent storm and the bottom of my ears were cold. I've had other hats of this type so I know the difference, the design of this one was more for fashion and the ties are there for the ""look"" rather than to serve a function."
5,Christopher Walken is superb,"Christopher Walken in a Stephen King tale, can it get any better?!! I'm a fan of both and I ordered it because of that."
4,In good hands,I just watched this film again for the first time since it was new. I had forgotten how well and easily this film fits into the Cronenberg canon. Both Stephen King and viewers of the film are in very good hands with Cronenberg.
2,Anecdotes,"I gave this book TWO stars instead of ONE because of the included anecdotes about patients of the authors.Save your money, and read this review instead of buying the book:Boys have feelings, not just girls.Boys are just as sensitive as girls.Listen to your son and he'll be emotionally healthy.Boys are special because they have lots of energy.Nope...nothing about your son being gay, if that's what you're looking for.I just listed those four things off the top of my head without even thinking about the book. As I read over what I wrote, I see that my blind guesses were right: That's pretty much what the book says in its 250 + pages."
2,Men who wish they were women,THis is classic 70' and 80's pshychobabble written for men who wish they were women or in the least think that if they say what women want them to think they will be loved by them. Reeking of PC misinformation - Really people - quit reading this junk and just go out and spend time with your son (or daughter)!! I cant tell you how many women spend hours and hours reading these books trying to 'understand' the men and boys in their lives - you know what - you would learn a lot more by just getting involved in what they are doing -
4,"Elaine's ""Raising Cain"" book review","Every parent, teacher, youth sports coach, and general public who interact with boys should read this book. After reading it, discuss with others who read it. Women, ask questions with trusted male friends."
4,a must read,"As I am looking back into my not-yet-gender-aware early childhood, I remember having been both fascinated and weary of boys. On one hand, they always attracted me with their spirit and honesty, on the other they scared me because I perceived them as impulsive and aggressive, not understanding what motivates them to do things they do. This book helped me fill in those long-forgotten gaps of knowledge -- just in time to better understand my rapidly growing son :) Even though this book does concentrate almost exclusively on a 'stereotypical boy' (i.e., a jock or an angry dropout), it is an invaluable resource for everyone, especially teachers and parents."
4,Only 4 cuz I have'nt had time to finish the book yet.,So I have had the book for only a few weeks but I'm very much enjoying it! It's a great book for parents. I wish my Parents would have had a few more recources like this when I was growing up.. There just was'nt alot in print concerning ADD/ADHD. When I was growing up. Now I plan to Minor in Psy.Chad
1,Sweet but oversimplified,The authors of this book create a sweet cheerleader-like portrait of boys that attributes their only challenges to a lack of emotional range. It's really a one-note book and many of the vignettes in it seem superficial and don't ring true. I didn't like this book nearly as much as REAL BOYS by William Pollack. Pollack's book really shows us what it's like to be a boy in America today and gives lots of helpful hints to parents about what to do. I got numbed out reading Raising Cain and had to push myself to finish reading it.
3,leave out the Hawaiian part,"the title is kind of misleading - I expected more traditional Hawaiian songs & less ""see spot run"" type instruction -"
5,Wonderful Book for Anyone Interested in Women Studies,"All I want to say is this book is the best anyone can get for students who are taking classes on women studies or anyone who appreciates feminism. It is so thoroughly detailed on collections of writings and covers wide range of categories from periods of time in America to race and ethnicity to rights among both genders. It is also easier to read because there is the information about the author(s) before each writing so I can easily imagine what life was like for women in certain periods of time, being the minorities, in employment, etc. Go read this book as soon as possible and feel what women in the writings go through and what the authors want us to interpret."
4,consummate romp of wacky madcap hijinks.,"Hulk Hogan's previous acting endeavors like ""No Holds Barred"" and a guest appearance on ""The A-Team"", not to mention his cameo in the beginning of ""Rocky 3"" do not even begin to prepare you for this piece of celluloid gold. Hogan plays a space commando who must take residence in - not the urban area - but - the suburban area, hence the title. Was my usage of hyphens there correct? END"
4,HULK'S BEST MOVIE TO DATE,"YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. I SAID IT. THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE HULK HOGAN HAS EVER DONE. THIS EVEN TOPS ''NO HOLDS BARRED''! AN OUT OF SPACE ENFORCER [HULK HOGAN] LANDS ON EARTH TO TAKE A BREAK FROM HIS ADVENTURES. BUT, TWO BOUNTY HUNTERS ARE ON HIS TRAIL. IT'S HILLARIOUS AND IT HAS SOME GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS. UNDERTAKER PLAYS ONE OF THE BOUNTY HUNTERS, IN CASE YOU DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW. THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE FOR HOGAN FANS [LIKE MYSELF] AND EVEN MAKES A GREAT FAMILY FILM."
3,it's okay,"This movie wasn't an all time great, funny in a few places. It does have Mark Calloway, The Undertaker, as the ""bad guy."""
4,Good Flick,Movie starts out in what seems to be a corny star wars rip off but then gets hilarious. I was really skeptical after the first 10 minutes but by the end I was hooked. My roomate even rewinded it at some parts they were so funny. This is a definite must see.
2,"""I was frozen today!""","""Suburban Commando"" is one of wrestler Hulk Hogan's many forays into ""family-friendly"" movies. In this one, he stars as Shep,an intergalactic hero on the run from evil bounty hunters and a preening,flamboyant bad guy. He crash lands on Earth, meeting an uptight businessman (Christopher Lloyd) and his wife (Shelley Duvall). He gives helpful inspirational moral lessons throughout the film, not unlike the '80s kiddie shows of the time ""He-Man"" and ""She-Ra."" The difference being,those shows were only a half hour,and actually enjoyable. In one cringe-worthy scene, Lloyd and Duvall are on the verge of making love. Yes,one day the kids will ask where babies will come from, but this scene will make them celibate. The final fight is horribly cheesy. ""Suburban Commando"" does embody the crass materialism of the suburbs.... no, it's just a bad movie."
5,Graboids!,"My husband and I both love this movie. Val and Earl are the perfect comic team. Funny, campy horror you can't go wrong!"
3,Campy fun with decent special effects,"Tremors is one of those monster films that makes fun of itself and other films in the process. The film takes place in a small desert town called Perfection. It's far from perfect and little do the townspeople know what's hiding underneath.An intentionally campy sci-fi horror film that offers plenty of laughs and a few thrills. The worms aren't bad designs either. It doesn't look like an ounce of CGI was put into it. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are very good as the handymen who take charge when the body count starts to pile up. Lacks a bit in the ending, but still good fun."
4,...So Bad It's Good!,"If you like cheesy horror movies, Tremors may be for you. But if you are looking for originality, I doubt you'll be impressed. Still, the actors do a reasonably good job and there are moments of shining comedy, such as the pole vaulting scene and the one where the aging couple kills a giant subterranean monster with nothing but firearms (way to go!). Still, I really don't like it when they portray all beastly animals as evil.As usual, Kevin Bacon saves the day with his naughty-but-nice personality, ladies-man charisma, and heroic deeds in character."
3,"Quirky ""Horror"" Comedy","In TREMORS, a small desert town is attacked by huge man-eating, destructive 'worms', and two cowboys - Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon - set out to stop them. That's the premise: no explanation for the worms' arrival, no elaboration.And this works. TREMORS is not a horror movie: it's not even scary. Sure, some moments make your heart beat a little faster, such as when the guys are being chased across land by the worms. But TREMORS doesn't take itself seriously, and you shouldn't take it seriously either.A few of the jokes fall flat, but on the whole TREMORS is an amusing, quirky comedy that's been overlooked."
4,"Funny, scary, corny, and downright great.","This is one of those movies I can sit back and watch over and over whenever I don't need a mental challenge. This movie is nothing but a little fun with some corn thrown in. I've seen it a dozen times and it always delivers the entertainment. Other than a little bad acting on Reba's part, its watchable. For some unknown reason everyone yells every line in the movie, but its still a fun ride. It would be a great movie to watch with the kids, but the language is a little rough in spots. Keep the mute button handy."
4,fun characters,"This movie has an interesting plot without the nonsense of an unnecessary backstory. The characters are fun to watch because they are extreme examples of every one of us. Although many people will deny it, I think that all of us can identify with one of the stereotype characters in this movie. Although the characters are over the top, I truly like everyone in the film and found myself talking to the screen, telling the characters to run or be quiet or whatever would save them. All in all, a fun movie and quite entertaining."
1,Worst Movie Ever Made,This movie is extremely pathetic and contains some of the worst acting I have ever witnessed in a movie. I can't believe all these fools love this thing...it's about gigantic mutant worms coming out of the ground! Check out Tremors 3: Back to Perfection for the best movie ever!
4,"Scary and awsome, Graboids Attack!!!!","Ron Underwood's best film yet, I say. If Graboids attacked my city, I would pull put A Mac Mashine Gun and shoot them!!!!!!!"
2,unpleasant memories of God,I tried to like this book but I just couldn't get past the number of accounts Bondi gave to her horrid upbringing. I realize this wasn't her intent but just when I thought she'd celebrate her success in working through her own theological beliefs- Boom! Back she went to retell the sources for her misguided theology from youth.It is truly remarkable that she had the will to seek answers; I was just hoping she'd give more attention to the life she now leads.
4,A good read,"Assigned to me to be read as before a spirituality seminar, I really enjoyed looking at the theological reflections of this past generation through the eyes of a theologian who is a woman. I was able to relate so much of what she said to experiences I have had with other women who have had a great influence on my own growth of thinking about God in these years."
5,Secrets are damaging! Speak your truth!,This book has changed my life and helped me to find myself and God. I recommend it to everyone to speak their truth to their loved ones.
3,Born with a Gift of Laughter and a Sense that the World was Mad...,"Make that 3+.Hey, I like my musketeers with a fair helping of daring, a twinkle in the eye, a sense for the droll, and some of that old-time gallantry too, and if directors see fit to take liberties with antique technology and to push the physical limits of human strength, agility and endurance in order to put on a good show then I say go for it and the critics be damned.And, of course, this is not a film I would expect to be winning critics' awards. It's all about entertainment. Crack open your favorite beverage, sit back and take it for what it is. A galloping romp. Perhaps not the greatest romp ever filmed, but close enough.That the film may stray from the Dumas canon is of no consequence to me whatever, and indeed the film's title as much as informs the viewer that we may be going off the well-beaten path. The acting, in my view, was adequate to its purpose. Deneuve was Deneuve and the principal cast carried the day."
1,What the hell !!!!!!!!,"can't remember the last time I rolled my eyes so many times in a movie I knew within the first 10 minutes of the show that it was gonna [be bad]See the acrobatic martial-artist French 17th-century swordsmen &#65533; words you had a right never to expect to see together! and the action is so badly edited and darkly lit that it's hard to tell what's happening many scenes dark and difficult to seeThis movie was one of the worst I have seen this year bad acting and the awful remake you must have watched Richard Lester's very enjoyable ""The Three Musketeers"" (1973) and ""The Four Musketeers"" (1974). Save your time and rent those two tonight."
3,Worth The Watch!!,"Alot of people ripped this movie, and thats all it is, a movie. There is alot of action and the sword fights were good but very Fast pace. DTS sound was GREAT on my system! I thought the story was good, it held my interest. If you just want to watch a movie and see the GOOD guys win, this is it!"
1,What kind of crap is this supposed to be?,This movie sucked. The Disney version was way better. Don't waste your money on this.
1,What the hell !!!!!!!!,"can't remember the last time I rolled my eyes so many times in a movie I knew within the first 10 minutes of the show that it was gonna {be bad]>See the acrobatic martial-artist French 17th-century swordsmen &#65533; words you had a right never to expect to see together! and the action is so badly edited and darkly lit that it's hard to tell what's happening many scenes dark and difficult to seeThis movie was one of the worst I have seen this year bad acting and the awful remake you must have watched Richard Lester's very enjoyable ""The Three Musketeers"" (1973) and ""The Four Musketeers"" (1974). Save your time and rent those two tonight."
1,Why?????,"Someone involved with this film should have read the book at some point. This makes either of Disney's versions valid. The best adaptation, to date, is the mid-'70's Three Musketeers/Four Musketeers directed by Richard Lester (A Hard Day's Night)and starring Michael York, Oliver Reed, Richard Chamberlain, Frank Finlay, Raquel Welch, and Charlton Heston. That version actually follows the book, for the most part, unlike this Musketeers meets Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon catastrophe."
1,It's pretty funny when people have to...,"...say ""sure, it's no Rob Roy"", or ""sure, it's no Mask of Zorro"" to defend this film, since the latter two films weren't all that great either. Or better yet, say ""Every film can't be an Oscar"". In conclusion, ""The Musketeer"" = worse than most B movies."
1,Not Worth even Renting,"I strongly prefer ""The Three Musketeers"" with Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, and Chris O'Donnell over this. The ladder room scene what the only this I actually considered worth watching."
1,Lackluster waste of time,"Many reviewers have done an excellent job detailing the shortcomings of this movie. I wish I would have looked here before renting it. On the plus side, The Musketeer has some nice looking sets and some well lit scenes. On the negative side, the lead actor is awful, the script trite and humorless, the whole presentation is just bland and unengaging. I didn't even like Tim Roth, who is just too sickeningly evil and even HE can't bring the part to life. Worst of all was the action choreography and editing. The fighting was so poorly staged and cut that I had to go back 2 or 3 times just to figure out what happened. Did anybody storyboard this stuff out? Why do these filmakers think they need to cut the action so fast? You rarely get a good look at the Musketeer when he's fighting. I quit watching after the 2/3 point."
1,"Make the ""i"" in HORRIBLE sound like a ""e"" and u know what i mean!!!","This was one of the worst movies I have ever watched. The story line is weak and the acting is horrible. For example, this woman got shot and she was like ""I'm not dead yet, please go and kill him!"" ok, that was just stupid!!!Also, they overdid the fighting and it was just too much, as if they tried hard to make it too amazing.Overall, HORRIBLE MOVIE!!!"
5,The fabulous Mambo Kings,Great Movie. Enjoyed the performances of Armand Assante and Antonio Banderas as brothers. 2 late great salsa musical talents. Celia Cruz and Tito Puente.
4,great old movie,It is a really good movie I watched long time ago i recommended to my wife and she love it to thank you.
2,Great compilation inferior audio quality,"I bought this compilation because it's filled with so many great songs. It even has some of Smokey's solo tunes. I am however disappointed with the ""remastering"" of a couple of key tracks on the first disk. Both Oh Baby Baby and The Tracks of My Tears sound terrible on this compilation. I'm sure there is some high quality recordings of these two songs out there. If audio quality is important to you pass on this particular comp."
3,The Further Perils of Laurel and Hardy,"Having enjoyed the Youngson Compilation on VHS (""Laurel and Hardy's laughing Twenties."") I waited for the producers to release the sequel, which was actually the first one I saw. The transfer is a little fuzzy and unclear while being almost white in certain portions. However, the documentary is jam-packed with a lot of jewels that have never been released before. The opening sequence from ""You're Darn Tootin'"" is a perfect example of how to edit a silent comedy scene with music as the central gag."
5,Surprisingly Good,"I was surprised how effective this CD was in helping me get a good sleep, better sleep than I've had for a while. At first I wasn't sure if I liked the approach, but the more I listened, the more sense it made. Mary really gets to some deeper issues around the whole insomnia thing, for which I'm grateful."
4,Da Vinci Set of 300 Welcome To Las Vegas Poker Chips w/Aluminum Case,"Quality is cool, but a little bit too light.I love the cool logo on the chips. good for normal game"
2,Too Fragile for Any Use Other then Display,"This was a great deal at under ten bucks and the set is very pretty. I photograph drinks for a website so this was perfect for presentation. The first glass broke from a very light TAP to the bottom when I placed it in the sink. The second glass to break - BROKE ALL BY ITSELF (SHOCK!). I had just finished washing the dishes (by hand) and went into another room. About 5 minutes later I heard a POP and the rim of one of the martini glasses popped right off in a complete circle. I have no idea how the third glass broke - when I picked it up the rim of the glass was separated. I will use the rest for photos, but this is NOT a durable set and would be a real disaster to serve guests, especially if they are wearing nice clothes."
1,Not good!,Every box had a problem. In each set there was one or more chipped glasses. I know that it was cheap but I cannot give them as holiday gifts as I planned. Totally disappointed.
3,Cute but poor Quality,"The martini set was cute and cheap, so I wasn't expecting excellent quality, but these things were breaking with the slightest touch. If you want some glasses for one time use and throw away these would be an excellent option. If you actually want something that will last for 3 to 4 uses, keep shopping around."
1,Damaged goods,"While my sister was extremely excited about the glasses I got her has a gift, one arrived broken. When I called customer service to replace the broken glass I was notified that Amazon would not replace the damaged item. I could get a full refund, but they would not send a replacement. I was appalled. What business refuses to replace damaged items? You can guarantee I won't be buying anything being shipped through Amazon anymore. I will buy directly from the seller."
3,really cute but not martini set,"this is a really cute set, and I got it for a steal... BUT it is nowhere near a martini glass size. the glasses are maayyyyyybe an apperatif size (hold about 2 oz.) and the large glass is gigantic. could be used for shot glasses or liquers."
2,cheap and flimsy for your pocket change,"Its not glass at all. It feels like plastic.The first time I filled the shaker with ice, the temperature drop caused it to simply crack and break.I paid very little for this item so I suppose I got what I paid for.However, it really does look just like glass. Perhaps there would be some decent reasoning in purchasing this just to keep your apartment looking a bit more interesting. Not much for use though."
1,Buyer Beware,"I thought I would take chance and buy the martini set, well when I opened the box, the plastic tray was cracked and all scratched up. One of the martini glasses had a chip on the rim. I sent it back. I had hoped it would make it to me in one piece but unfortunately not. Do not buy this, you will not be impressed."
4,AS EXPECTED,The Art of Oil Painting (GRUMBACHER LIBRARY) is an old book. I was happy to find a good used copy for below $1.I expect good service. i received good service.THANX!!
1,One of the most disappointing romances ever,"This one was my first book by VH and it has left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I'll think twice before I buy other books written by her. I read the book till when Kitty marries Charles and finally, sleeps with him while she still had Patrick in her heart.I couldn't read another page after that. Throughout the book she's been saving herself for Patrick and at the end of it she gives into someone she's not even in love with. Kitty's character is a very sorry example for a heroine, especially when she's tempted to give into most men she meets at every turn, including the captain of the ship that transports her from United Kingdom to United States...Skip this book, you're not missing anything."
2,Didnt enjoy very much....,"This is the second book of Virginia Henley's that Ive read, and I was disappointed in it after reading ""A Year and a Day"". It was no where near the quality of story as a Year. Don't get me wrong I did not hate the book, but I found the characters totally stupid at times, and unintelligable. Im taking my book to the used book store tomorrow to trade for something else. I guess I will have to try another one of Virginia Henley's books to see how they fare."
4,Entertaining Crime Fiction!,"The flow of the book is a little strange. It starts out in short, sometimes incomplete sentences which bothered me a little. However, once I got into the book and used to the flow, I thouroughly enjoyed it! Kinky Friedman is the main character who is a country singer turned private sleuth. The crime and clues are as puzzling as the strange array of friends and suspects. I thought I had the mystery figured out about 6 times, but did not know the truth until the end. Puzzling, Funny, and Bizarre are the best words to describe the Kinkster. A very entertaining read!"
2,Keep this away from Children!,"This product was not properly labeled as unsafe for children! I had bought this to power an invention I had picked up at Professor Manglebot's garage sale, but the twins got into the can and now I have two fused three year old boys who keep burning holes into the carpet with their eyes."
2,Does Not Work in Flux Capacitor,I bought myBack to the Future: Flux Capacitor Replica Unlimited Editionfor my time machine in 2034. It worked fine for a while but broke down when I was in 2011. Now I have to wait 23 years until the warranty kicks in.Having quite a bit of time on my hands I thought I'd tryUranium Orein the flux capacitor.Nope.I guess now I'm gonna buy some crossword puzzle books and wait around for 2034.
4,This Uranium Tastes Great!,"I know what you are thinking. ""It is really hard to beat some fresh Plutonium on organic whole wheat toast."" You'd be right, but this uranium is not bad for the money. This uranium will really get you going in the morning. It warms you up all the way down. It also stimulates an almost instant bowel movement. It will surely keep you regular. Just make sure you have on hand a large supply of quality toilet paper. The only drawback is the rectal bleeding. Still, this uranium deserves a solid 4 stars. Yum!"

4,Not a substitute for Buttocks Ointment but works,"Truth be told, I ran out of buttocks ointment. I was really chafed and irritated after a long day of wearing my new dungarees. The high humidity did not help. In my predicament I was willing to try anything for relief. I swabbed a two finger amount of this Uranium Ore on the effected area, and was pleasantly surprised of its instant relief qualities. It glowed a little through my pants, but other than that, no noticeable problems."
4,Ore What?,Uranium Ore what? Or else? Or not? Or haggis monsters sing thee to thy rest? But had to order some to find out. Makes good snuff. I hit 600 in my softball league when I use it. Sure clears out the sinuses. Could drive a truck through my nasal passages. But still don't know ore what?
3,I guess this means we invade Amazon,This is the kind of stuff we as a people used to go to war over(last week). The new guy has only been in office a couple of days so perhaps we can still squeeze in another war. We can just send a can of this stuff to a would-be enemy (Canada?) and we get to invade. Then we zip on over to the UN and piss off the French and any other European who is for the yellow cakers. After we ignore the UN because they won't let us pick a fight we invade (Canada).If I were a tin-horn dictator I would be watching my mail really closely from now on. Talk a about opening up a can of whip-a$$...
3,Woops!,"I bought this Uranium to power my DeLorean but after I received it I remembered that I needed Plutonium. D'oh! I'll be damned if I'm eating the shipping costs, so I've decided just to build a nuclear sub for trolling around Lake Erie."
1,This was a bad idea,I ate the whole thing and it tasted funny and now I feel funny and sometimes I lose control of my finghersda';jaf[sdij but mostly I'm okay I guess. What I'm trying to say is that this candy is terrible.
2,Needs more cowbell,After receiving my can o ore I just cant help but to think it could use a little cowbell.
1,dosent work at all,I bought it... I used it... It dosent work...I dont want to talk about it because Just talking about it makes me angry...and you wouldnt like me when Im angry.
3,Works as advertised be BIG WARNING,"This product works as advertised, but there's a BIG WARNING: I had this in the back of my car and was driving on the freeway at night. When I hit 88MPH I hit landed in a barn, hit a pine tree, got chased by some jerks (one wearing 3D glasses for some reason) and had the HARDEST time getting home. Oh yeah, some lady kept calling me Calvin even though that's not my name. Strange. So be careful. This stuff is heavy."
4,Hard to Find Refill for Madame Curie Play Set,"My daughter was hearbroken when she ran out of the uranium ore supply that came with her Madame Curie Playschool set. These things always happen at the most inconvenient times....in this case, when she was almost half way through recreating the Theory of Radioactivity. Of course, she has done this already over 20 times (and demonstrated the difference between polonium and radium) but like most 8 year olds, if you like something, you just do it over and over again! My husband and I looked everywhere for the uranium ore refill and I don't have to tell you how hugely popular the Madame Curie play set was over Christmas! The refill was sold out every where....even in Toys R Us and Costco. Finally, we found it on Amazon. The price is a bit high but it is certainly worth our daughter's happiness. She's been looking a bit pale lately (she's always been a little anemic) and this will certainly brighten her day!"
1,Shipping Costs are Ridiculous and Packaging Insane.,"I contacted the seller to order the 2000 Tons I would need for my, er... project, and inquired about a shipping discount for larger quantities.Not only will the seller not offer any sort of bulk discount, they insist on shipping all orders at advertised unit size and in the pictured can!I'm going back to the Parking Lot Libyans. At least they won't up-charge you to repackage for bulk purchases; and THEY offer Free Delivery to any mall within 50 miles of your house."
1,Lack power.,Very pleased with the price.....and then I tested it. Might be a batch problem but my sample was only able to generate 1.20 gigawatts.
5,I ordered some....,To send to that nice Mr Ahmedinejad in Teheran.He told me he wanted it for his garden.Sadly my order of a thousand tins was rejected and some law enforcement dudes want to speak to me.
3,What the heck?!?!?!,"I bought this along with some thorium lantern mantles, 500 ionization smoke detectors, some sheets of beryllium, some lead shielding and a textbook on nuclear physics. Then the next day the NRC, DHS and the EPA were knocking on my door.... Really, what the hell man, can't I make a plutonium breeder reactor in the privacy of my own home?Also after ingesting a small amount, the poor cat's hair has fallen out, he's been glowing for the past month month and keeps chasing himself in the dark, is there anything I can do for him?"
4,Veterinary Chemo for Cheap!,"My pet rat had some weird tumor in her side, so I just taped a chunk of this to her for a couple of days, and before you knew it, boom! Tumor gone! Only 4 stars because she was dead too, but that makes the whole taxidermy thing a whole lot easier, so hey!"
4,Great for snowboarding,"My office mate bought the uranium ore as a white elephant gift at our office's holiday party this year. At first I had no idea what to do with it. Perfect white elephant, right? But then I realized that since it was just always so warm, I could use my steel grinder at home to shave off a bunch of dust, put it into one of those cloth bags my wife uses for potpourri and I'd have an instant hand warmer for snowboarding! I've been using them all winter and started selling a few on e-bay. Well worth the investment."
3,It's not as cool as you think...,"You open the can and really all you see is a boring piece of rock in a plastic bag... The warnings that come with it freak you out enough to not want to open the bag or touch it- not for fear of getting too close to it but so the Uranium dust isn't absorbed by your skin or sucked into your lungs.After a few days you start to wonder, how little is little when it comes to dosages of radiation? Ultimately you think about getting rid of it but figure trying to throw it out, bury it, or toss it off a bridge will just come back to haunt you when someone finds a 3 eyed fish and this can that has somehow probably been registered to your name.Finally you pack it in a bunch of other metal cans, and put it in the furthest corner of your garage or tool shed and hope for the best. One day I will take it back out and attempt to grow tomacco."
3,What I didn't find on Amazon Africa,"I heard in a televised speech by a famous dim-bulb that a now-deceased, third-rate tin-pot dictator tried to buy this product from Amazon Africa, but later I heard from a friend who actually visited Amazon Africa on advice of his wife that the dictator didn't in fact attempt to buy this product. It turns out that my friend was right and that had the dim-bulb listened to him in the first place he could have avoided a great deal of trouble. In spite of this, apparently the dim-bulb and his posse, perhaps motivated by embarrassment, spent a great deal of time and energy spreading nasty falsehoods about my friend and his wife. So devoted were they to their childish rumor-mongering campaign that eventually my friend's wife lost her job. What sort of adults would engage in such shameful behavior? It's hard to believe."
2,no purificatioon so forget it,if I can't purify the stuff and get at least 2-3 pounds of fissionable u-235 what good is it to me ... I ask you? I just want to put in a swimming pool - admittedly a BIG one in a certain country that has a name that is made up of 4 letters and the first one is a vowel. BUT HEY what the heck. Just kidding
1,Very disappointed,"My husband was assured by a certain group of scientists that this would make his hair grow back so we immediately bought several containers. His hair grew alright...on his back, on the soles of his feet and I won't even go into details about the fact that he'll never be able to wear swim trunks out in public again. His head, however, remains bald. To add insult to injury, now I've started growing a moustache and I've never even used it."
3,Failed miserably,"I bought this to power my Uranium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator and it didn't even destroy an entire asteroid, much less any small planets. Well, back to the drawing board..."
5,"At Long Last Amazon... my Fave ""As Seen On TV"" product !!!","Hey, Kids!!! Get your very own core sample, as seen in the opening credits of 'The Simpsons' !!! Mmmm... Uranium.The infomercial features none other than Billy Mays, continual winner of the ""World's Most Obnoxious TV Pitchman"" award for over a decade now. Hopefully Billy will have a 'mishap' during the taping and drop the sample down his pants."
3,Wait for the Upgrade,"I have it from a inside source that the upgrade version is coming out soon. I'm waiting for the Plutonium edition. If you order now, they'll throw in a symmetric imploding sphere FREE!!! And I thought I would never be able to buy a neutron bomb. I do think the manufacturer has been a little careless in not disclosing this is for entertainment purposes only. I mean Kim Jong Il keeps ordering it by the truch load and they keep running out of stock. This way only the true nuke home gamers would get their bomb, uh,hum I mean provide the peaceful civilian application of nuclear technology to the complex and expensive power needs of a growing world."
1,complete bs,"jack t. chick is a psychopath and writes these things that promote intolerance in the most extreme way.he says lots of people are going to hell, but it will be him who ends up there for not treating his fellow man with respect and kindness."
2,What WERE they thinking?,"Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt are both fine actors, and no doubt have their choice of dozens of great roles anytime they want them. So how did they wind up in this stilted, overproduced piece of jetsam? I should know by now that any film written or directed by Nancy Meyers is going to stink, but somehow I watched this one anyhow. Big mistake! Every scene feels contrived; you can just see the writers going ""now comes the scene where.... ""If the same premise had been developed by the ""Seinfeld"" team, it could have been hilarious. As-is, it's heavy-handed and moralizing through and through. And Gibson gives his hammiest performance since ... well, ever. Ugh! I'm giving it two stars (rather than one) because Helen Hunt's warmth and sincerity make it at least bearable, and the production values are quite good for the most part."
3,Great movie - terrible ending,"My wife and I purchased this movie thinking Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt must be pretty good - after the first 1/2 hour - it became a car wreck. Not really anything worth watching but you do anyway. The ending was the worst, about as good as the ""6th Day"" ending. The writer just leaves you hanging. Definitely rent before you buy."
2,"TIRED, FORMULAIC DRIVEL","I am not a fan of Mel Gibson, nor am I a fan of Helen Hunt. Their pairing here is not endearing. The jokes are tired. The story stale. The idea of a chauvinistic, womanising man getting electrocuted and then magically living through the ordeal only to be able to read the minds of all women he encounters... in his dreams. A man this callous and shallow would not use this power to become a gentler, more sensitive man. He would use it to get exactly what he wanted. Sure, his character does exploit his new gift to an extent, but of course, the end is just picture-perfect because he has become so sensitive and soft-hearted that he can practically read the mind of leading lady Helen Hunt even without his improbable skill. I am not impressed."
3,Not much to offer......,"This movie was very disappointing! I will never learn to not believe the trailers for movies. Mel Gibson is great with the comedy in the first 45 minutes but after that played below his usual level; Helen Hunt has NO character charisma and NOTHING going between her and Mel Gibson. The movie was predictable and has a disappointing/flat ending. I think I expected more from the main characters and more story from the movie. Not this time! BUT...I watched it all the way through, laughed a lot and recommend that if you choose to watch the movie, rent and do NOT purchse the movie."
3,A hit and miss at the same time,"Who doesn't love Mel Gibson, but What Women Want is not the best work he has done, even with Helen Hunt as his counterpart. There are funny moments in this movie, but Gibson's chauvanistic character gets to be a little too much to handle. There are funny parts, but it didn't live up to what it could have been."
3,What Woman dont want!,I enjoyed the comedy in the movie but the ending totally ruined it. its a good rainy day movie and definetly a chick flick.
2,What do women want?,"My guess, is that women want a stronger movie than this. It's an interesting premise. But what we have is a strictly average movie. The movie is formulaic. The movie is beneath Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt, and I'm surprised that either of them took the parts. In the end he turns around to be the better man, she gets her job, love wins out, a neat, pat ending, blah, blah, blah. We've seen this movie many times before. This one just runs a little longer."
3,"Thank god for Mel, but too silly for him","I liked the movie, who doesnt like entertainment you don't have to think about? but my problem was helen hunt-why does everyone think she is so great? i think the plot was kinda clever and funny and maybe got old a little too quick, but she was the worst part. visually annoying and not conducive to a good movie. i don't get what hollywood see's in her-mind boggling! i feel for mel, he is amazing-lets not lose faith in him."
1,*GAG* - Not another sugar-coated chick flick!!,"This movie proves that Hell is full and the dead are walking the Earth, making these movies and sitting in theatres watching them. The old ""all men are scum until they get in touch with their feelings"" plot is dredged up again in this lamebrain film. I guess I was supposed to get all doe-eyed and say ""Is'nt Mel dreamy?"" and laugh at the supposed ""Comedy"" while watching this flick, but it made me wretch! Boring, silly and a waste of time.What do men want? Our money back!"
3,"So-So Flick, Could've Been Better","I felt that because of a few scenes in the movie, it kept me from liking it like I wanted to. There was a sex scene that really didn't belong there and kinda made you not like Gibson's character. I realize he was supposed to be a womanizer, but I just didn't like it. It coulda been better, but Helen Hunt really shines and I enjoy everything she does!!!"
3,Could have been good.,"I actually quite liked the premise of the ""man's man"" all women adore. I loved the beginning of the film, and how his mother was a chorus girl, etc. I liked his scoundrel personality and wished I could have seen much, much more of it. Unfortunately, stealing someone else's ideas to get ahead and steal her job is not the action of a charming scoundrel you're supposed to love despite yourself - it's the action of a louse you can't help but despise. Worse than that, he actually becomes rather good at the end of the picture, and repents and saves the life of a totally unimportant and boring female victim, just so we ""forgive"" him. What a waste of a good idea.Watch the first part and turn it off."
4,Daft funk.,"Some may ask why, but I say bring on a collection like this. Why not? This is primo music. Is it techno or electronica, who cares, just dance and enjoy. My biggest complaints are, why six tracks from ""Homework"", and only three from ""Discovery""? Also, some of these songs like ""Rollin' & Scratchin'"" and ""Robot Rock"" are SO repetitive (I know that's the point), they get old by the three minute mark. Yet, other tracks like ""Around The World"" and ""One More Time"" are perfection, hence the classics they are. One other disappointment....where the hell is ""Digital Love""? That song should be here before many of these. Still, these are all good at the least, and it's a good sampling of their three albums. Toss on a few remixes to choice tracks like ""Da Funk"" and ""Human After All"", and you've got a collection even a robot could love. There's also a deluxe edition of this with videos, but hey, that's what Youtube is for."
2,Well written but diagrams useless,"The book is very well written but, if you need to see what the moves look like, you'll need to get a video or another book. I cannot make out a single move from the diagrams provided and the few photos are so lacking in what comes between point A and point B that they are useless too. I was glad I didn't pay much for the book."
3,"A Good Starting Poing, but....","A fair while back when I was just beginning my queries and foray into Taijiquan, this was the first book I purchased. As a beginner's aide for an overview of the subject, it was a friendly and helpful introduction. Now that I am broadening my studies, there are books I bought early on that I still continue to use; this book is not one of them. The information contained in this book, compared to others, is incomplete in detail and provides only enough to wet your appetite. At the price, I wouldn't call this book a bargain meal or a waste of money, but I would suggest you check for it in your local public library before purchasing it. More than likely, it is a book you will quickly outgrow (within months at most) if your interest in Taijiquan (or Qigong for that matter) is more than a passing phase."
1,There are none so blind then those who refuse to see!,"Yes Mrs Pulling has done her best to caution others about ""breaking with reality"", and her book serves as an adequate example of what can happen when someone does become reality impared; it contains no real facts to support her claims that Dungeons and Drangons had any thing to do with any deaths what so ever, and what ""facts"" she does offer are either falsely described or out right lies. I agree that if you are a bad parent you should probably error on the side of caution and limit the activities of your little monster, but I think ""not keeping guns in the house"" and ""not letting your child butcher pets"" (both things Mrs Pulling admits she or her son did) should come well before stopping them from playing D&D. Besides if you get rid of D&D who will you blame when they finally do kill someone?"
5,This book is an epiphany--,"This book changed my life. It changed my entire perspective of my citizenship in this country. It gave me an insight into our country's history that made it possible for me to understand all that happened afterwards. It gave me a way to find hope within the realization of despair that the aftermath of Reconstruction caused, then and now. It gave me a way to understand the deepest meaning of the music I express--jazz improvisation. I think this is one of the greatest books ever written. It is a history classic, on the highest level."
5,QUAIL HUNTING TRAINING YOUR BIRDDOG,A VERY GOOD AND INFORMATIVE VIDEO OF THE PROCESS OF TRAINING A BIRD DOG FROM START TO FINISH. THE VIDEO WAS NOT REAL CLEAR BECAUSE OF BEING USED BUT SATISFACTORY FOR THE INFORMATION I WAS LOOKING FOR.
5,My new favorite book,"I higly recommend this book. This book ropes you in from the beggining. This review may not be helpful, I just wanted to rate this a five. Read the book, you won't regret it."
5,mcosby,It wa SOOO good I couldn't put it down. I'd read on the way to work and loathe having to end my public transportation commute( which clearly says a lot for those of you who have to suffer on the bus)
3,Great story. Bad Modern Library translation,"The Count of Monte Cristo is a great read and one of the first ""modern"" epic adventure novels. Dumas' style is years ahead of his contemporaries. But you wouldn't know this from reading the Modern Library edition because its poor translation gets in the way of both the story and the storytelling. The translator - who is not acknowledged (you won't find his or her name anywhere) - chooses words poorly, punctuates badly, and uses English words that while literally correct are either archaic or inappropriate in context. (For example, using the word ""bullet"" for ""cannon ball."") Alexandre Dumas is well worth reading and I recommend the Count of Monte Cristo to everyone, but choose another version. Most Modern Library editions are exceptional; this one is an exception."
5,Exceptional Book,"IT'S BY ALEXANDRE DUMAS!!!!!Simply put, an amazing book. The quality of Dumas's work is incredible. I couldn't put it down the entire way through. It is witty and yet intellectual. I have never read a ""classic book"" in all of my 16 years that compares to this (although several have been quite good!). The Count of Monte Cristo is a must read for one and all."
5,A pretty slick book.....,"Needless to say, it's not everybody's cup of tea, but I like it. It's not like the three musketeers, with a brawl every two minutes, though I also liked 3 Musketeers. It's more for the type who like to read about manipulation, greed, and intrigue out the wazoo.....and a lot of people dying spasmodically. As for the comments that it's boring, well, Dumas is occasionally long winded, but the story is extremely clever all in all, and pretty much anybody can see a little bit of himself/herself in Edmond Dantes, or vice-versa."
5,Kudos to Dumas & especially Robin Buss,"I was first introduced to Edmund Dantes as a child (circa 1946)and was enthralled by the child's edition of this classic. Even the movies of the day told the story of The Count of Monte Cristo (abridged and with the ""typical Hollywood altered screenplay."" The story has been a classic since its inception; but Robin Buss translates the French with aplomb clarity and poetry. He has made this magnificent novel in French a magnificent novel in English. Read it and enjoy. It is a masterful translation of a masterful story."
4,count of monte cristo,its a great story no problems but i wish it had table of contents but for FREE cant beat it
4,Fast Delivery,"I bought this book last minute as a Christmas gift and received it just in time for me to wrap as a little something extra. Great, new condition and happy with the service"
2,too small,print is too smallbook is too smallexpected book to be biggernot happy at all wish i could return
1,The Count of Monte Cristo - (for Kindle),There are TONS of words that are joined with no space between them. There are too many as to be conscionable. Does no one proof read these things?
4,A Classic!,"It is one of a must have classic stories of all time. With the price, and the illustration, there was no second guessing on buying this book."
4,Outstanding!!!!,"The bottom line is that this is an outstanding book. Unlike many works of classic literature, this book does not gbet overly wordy. Unfortunately, Dumas does begin to confuse the reader at times. This is due to a high number of characters who are either having affairs, scheming together, etc. From that standpoint, it was at times (short though they may be) like a very complicated soap opra. Fans of Monte Cristo are advised to read Les Miserables, by Victor Hugo."
5,A gripping novel of harrowing adventure and suspense!,"This is clearly one of Dumas' masterpieces. In the first chapter the reader is immediately enthralled by the evocative prose and lush descriptions. I've always thought that being exposed to great literature would inevitably have a positive impact on the reader, enabling him/her to use language to better effect and perhaps even spell correctly. Sadly, in the case of other Amazon reviewers, this appears to be completely untrue."
3,An oldie but goodie,"This is a very dated but enjoyable romp. If you just want to be entertained and to enjoy a simpler time than our stressed out world, step back into this novel. Nothing deep, just pure escapism."
3,"Great book, but buy a different version","This is a great book and I highly recommend it, but don't buy this enriched classic version of the book. It was good, but I felt like something was missing, and not until I finished the book did I discover that this version leaves out significant portions of the actual story. Nowhere in this book does it tell you that it is an abridged version, but it actually is. Buy a different version of this book."
5,Expectation Realized,"I bought this book without a picture, but by the description written. It turned out great. It got to me in a timely manner with no problems and was a book in excellent condition."
3,A great book in desperate need of an editor,"Great story, excellent writing. I love the approach, but in the end, it's too durn long. Dumas needed an editor in the worst way -- he goes down long rat-holes (well-written rat-holes, mind you) to advance the plot a centimeter."
5,Twisted plot and deep characters highlight this superb book,"I read this for a summer reading book, and although sometimes I had to reread some parts of it to fully grasp it, it is one of the best books I've ever read. The characters are incredibly realistic while the themes and inner stories are rich and touching. If you enjoy exhilerating adventure, tender romances, or cold blooded murder, this story is definitely for you."
5,AN ALL TIME CLASSIC!,"I was absolutly intrigued from the very first page. The rapid sequence of events makes it impossible to put the book down. I particullarly favor the part when Edmond is in jail and befriends, and later gains immense knowledge, from the Abe. I was panicked when Dantes attempts to escape (and succeeds) after being hurled into the ocean in place of his dead friend. I love the genius character (Edmond Dantes)that Dumas has created. Dumas' wonderful way with words leads the reader to feel an array of emotions through the coarse of the novel. ~15 yrs."
5,A brilliant classic,I was surprised how brilliant this book was. After the first few chapters the story was so compelling that I could hardly put it down. Dumas has the art of telling a story whilst placing it in the context of history and making the historical characters believable.Each character seems real wth flauxs and all. A wonderful story perfect for everyone to read and perhaps easier than the Three Musketers and the Man in the Iron Mask.
5,Amazing masterpiece!,I can't believe I just read this for the first time. A grand and sweeping epic that is spellbinding. Do not question...buy it!
3,The Count of Monte Cristo (Tor Edition),"I purchased the Tor Edition Count of Monte Cristo for the Kindle. I have always enjoyed this novel because of it's wonderfully involved plot and characters. I was disappointed in Tor Edition. This is an abridged version with much of the flavor of the original edited out. I read several chapters and found myself missing much of the writing that connects the story's plot lines and makes the story coherent. Rather than continuing with this edition, I found a more complete, possibly unabridged, edition also for the Kindle.I would not recommend the Tor Edition of the Count of Monte Cristo but recommend to anyone wanting an excellent winter read to find an unabridged version and settle in for a great time."
4,Incomplete. This is a major undertaking...,"I happened into a foreign film of theCount of Monte Cristo, and was charmed by it. So I checked Amazon for a written copy. Heavens, it's a 'classic'!It was originally written in French a couple hundred years ago, so you have to depend on a good translation.You may also want to concider an abridged version if lots of details and many words annoy you.It takes place as Napoleon is in and out of power, and the politicos are jumping back and forth with theiralligence. And there is misplaced love, castles, dungeons,luck, no luck etc....and I'm not very far yet! But it does make me want to read on. Ann Cedar Rapids, IA"
1,No results for me,"I bought this with the hope of boosting the signal from my large attic-mounted outdoor aerial antenna. I have a 3-way splitter sending the signal to the TVs in the house. My house is ~30 miles from the antennas on South Mountain with clear line of sight. Things were fine before June 2009, but since the digital changeover a few of the Phoenix channels (12, 15, 45, 51, 61) have become weak and sporadic (available one day, not the next). One of my TVs has a signal meter. It read ""75"" before I installed the booster, and ""67"" was the best I could get after I put it inline between the antenna and the 3-way splitter. Since installing the booster I no longer get 12.1 (or subchannels) on one TV, and cannot get 15.1 (or subchannels) on the others. On all TVs channel 45.1 and it's subchannels stutter as if half of the digital bits are coming through."
3,had 28 channels,had 28 channels on my dtv .... took a chance to see if i could get better or more because my cable wire is about 50 feet ... after installing by the instructions i had 16 channels .. so i removed it and i am happy with the 28 i got ... tried it over my folks they had 13 channels now they have 27 ..
4,"An interesting idea, which they sort of pulled off","The idea for this issue is really interesting: A collection of works of art and short stories, each with a companion piece of music on the accompanying CD by They Might Be Giants, with contributions by others including Philip Glass and Mike Doughty. Unfortunately, most of the art included is not very good, but some of it is at least amusing---and the short stories are pretty good for the most part. Likewise for the music, the tracks that accompany the art selections are mostly just okay, but the ones that go along with the stories are generally more substantial, longer and better. On the whole, a cool little book which I quite enjoyed perusing. Three and a half stars."
4,Good Product,"Arrived on time, works fine, nothing broken. I would have liked to have it be fulfilled by Amazon, but maybe they will change that later. 4/5"
4,Women from another planet? Our lives in the universe of Autism,"The first part of this book was extremely difficult to follow at times, because of the nature of formatting of the discussions. Having said that, what was interesting in that section was the way in which the discussion developed and the many varied ways the women expressed themselves. As a woman diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome, I read this yearning to hear how other women on the spectrum thought. It is brilliant for that.The second part of the book is where people have written aspects of their stories and poems. This is for reflection. It is quite amazing and many parts of it, showed me glimpses of how I thought. I was not alone! I was 'normal' like these women.This book was a godsend! Thank you."
4,Great material,Material receive in great condition. Very cost worthy and practical. Highly recommend future purchases for my continued education needs. Material will be added to reference.
3,fair,"I have done a number of SAT prepatory books; the 10 Real SATs. Barron's, Grubert, and recently I finished this one. There are actually only 3 tests in the book, the rest of the tests are in the cd rom. The book itself is decent, although the tests and examples are a bit easy, and the scale for the scores are too high. However, if you really want to get ready, you'll be better off buying the Grubert first."
1,Very bad Blu Ray transfer,"I like the movie. But this recording is terrible.It is NOT 1080p, and the sound is mostly mono."
1,Dvd does not work,"Dvd does not work in my samsung blu-ray player..... Just keeps trying to load... Very disappointed. Would have order a replacement, but saw that somebody else had the same issue. So why bother.JUST WANTED TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW WHO HAD THIS PROBLEM THAT THE DVD DOES WORK. YOU HAVE TO GO TO SAMSUNG'S WEBSITE AND DO THE UPDATE FOR YOUR BLU-RAY PLAYER. AFTER WE DID THE UPDATE BLU-RAY DVD WORKED GREAT."
5,Es grandiosa!,"Esta película es una de mis favoritas, nunca me canso de verla y ahora que la he encontrado en video definitivamente voy a comprarla. Me encanta la historia de amor entre Johny y Baby, los bailes son maravillosos, la música es excelente. Además te enseña a luchar por las cosas que valen la pena. Es un clásico!"
4,Dirty Dancing again,Item was very nicely packaged. Watching this movie brought back the memories of when I first watch it when I was much younger. The bonus DVD had alot of behind the scenes and extras which made it a very nice addition to any fan of the movie.
4,High Entertainment with lots of sex[y] energy!,"This movie is so fun, the dancing is just so enjoyable to watch and the love affair between actors Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey is so real. The way they moved together playfully but professionally was capitivating. The movie was mainly positive and upbeat except for the thread of social prejudice that comes between actors Patrick and Jennifer. The modern dances mixed with the older steps all blended so well together. I haven't seen a dance movie of this calibre in a long time. I saw Moulin Rouge but it just doesn't live up to this one. The visuals in Moulin Rouge are really stunning but Dirty Dancing has more chemistry between the two actors and the dance numbers just seem better to me! Well, needless to say, a must see!!Lisa Nary"
5,Dancing Your Way to Independent Film Spotlight....,This is an amazing film especially because it is one of the first of the independent films to break through the glass ceiling versus studio films. It is a great film to see for anyone who wants to write their own script or yearns to turn their own novel or life story into a movie. Nostalgic look at coming of age through a summer experience of awe. Jennifer Grey is hauntingly warm and amazingly open in her performance. Patrick Swayze remains eternally sexy. Dance is simply a vehicle for showing passion and expression especially in a generation gap world like the surroundings of where they work in the Poconos. This film has a heartbeat that just keeps on going -- kind of like the Energizer bunny-- you can watch it at different phases of your life and find that it reminds you of something in the past yet at the same time hints at the potential for your future even if you can't waltz or Foxtrot your way to the same spotlight they chose.
5,This is the best movie in the whole world!!!,"I know the whole movie word for word. There isn't one bad part through out it. Patrick Swayze is a great actor. And Jennifer Grey did perfect. This is my favorite movie, I watch it everyday. Everyone should own a copy."
1,bo-ring,"i don't like dance movies in the first place, so it was really hard for me to enjoy this.actually, i didn't enjoy it."
5,A Must See For Everyone! Best Ever!,"This movie is the best one i have ever seen. I can't ever seem to get enough of it. Between my girls and I, we have wore out 2 videos watching it so much. If you haven't seen it, you are really missing out! You'll hate yourself for not watching it sooner!"
5,a classic!,my mom and i both enjoy watching this movie from time to time so it was awesome to find a used copy for only 38 cents! thanks so much!
4,Dirty Dancing DVD Review,The original product we received had a scratch but it was immediately replaced. Excellent customer service.
5,Gag gift,I hope this movie bring loads of pain to the recipient as it was in response to an errant comment in e mails passed around. hehehe It certainly brought a good laugh upon opening.
5,A great help when studying the skeletal anatomy,I am a radiography student and this little skeleton comes in very handy when studying the bones and learning the bony landmarks.
5,rateing usher,I love usher and his music. He is great. I love his c.d. he is a greeat dancer. Every time i see his videos all i can say is damn! He is extreamly gorgeous and the brother can sing! all i got to say is that i've(GOT IT BAD) for usher.
3,Pretty Good,The CD is decent but not great. I think one of the major problems is that however recorded it did not do a good job mixing it and making the music clearer. If if had been recorded better I think it would have sounded better but most of the songs just didn't do it for me but still if you are an Usher fan it is worthwhile to buy but only if you like Usher quite a bit.
4,Beauty,"yes!. About time. The wonderful music in these films are worth it by themselves, Great actors in Mickey Rooney and Judy garland.Great escapism from a serious world.Wonderful!"
4,A little hard to follow but I like it!,I had to read this 2 times to catch on to what was going on (I don't think I was paying enough attention). It's wasn't one of those books that I couldn't put down although it was very good.
3,I think it was ok,I bought this book twice and still can't really tell you what it was about. While reading it the 2nd time it sounded really familiar but don't most urban fantasy books? Cast in Shadow is not awful and not great but somewhere inbetween. The author has good ideas so I'm going to try the rest of this series.
2,Cast In Shadow,"The book was enjoyable enought to read once, but not enough to re-read when the next book comes out in the series. When I became intrested in this series 6 books were out. I read all six. If I buy it I read it. I'm 90% sure I won't buy number 7."
1,LATERAL THINKING IS RIGHT-BRAIN PROCESSING,"Lateral thinking is right-brain processing. de Bono didnt invent anything new.I'm a de Bono fan going back to 1968 and his book NEW THINK. But since 1972, or so, all de Bono does is repackage NEW THINK and sell it to new converts and acolytes."
1,STALKER LOVE,"This is a reprint of a story from a former era when it was not only apparently acceptible, but actually romantic for a man to become obsessed with a woman he doesn't know, repeatedly watch her from a distance without her knowledge, and then lie to her about knowing who she is when circumstance causes them to meet (he's watching her again when she is finally made aware of his presence). I found this to be far more creepy than romantic. It's interesting that this title was determined worthy of reprint at this time. It's worth reading only by someone interested in the idea that this could have been considered the beginning of a healthy relationship a generation ago."
2,not her best,this book is not one of her bests. i found it boring and that i was struggling through it. when i read the intro it sounded good but then when i started reading i just didn't like it at all. i mean it was basically an on going battle between Trevor trying to make her love him and her protesting because she loved Richard. it was just sooo boring!
5,Just what I expected from Sandra Brown!,"I really enjoyed this book, especially it's ending. She captures people's feelings especially Trevor's and it makes you sympathize. It just is one more that shows how talented Sandra really is."
2,Soft Porn,I am no prude but this book was a little too revealing for my taste. It wasn't a classy love story. It was basically pornographic in some parts. And the whining by Kayla. It went on and on.
5,Excellent!,"Whether you're a fan or just curious, this is a fabulous DVD. Thorough, interesting and entertaining. A must see!"
1,below expectations!,"I was disappointed with this film, having heard all the good reviews. The chase scene really isn't that spectacular. I could not believe it when I saw this garbage beat out A Clockwork Orange for best picture! For a better action flick, check out Dirty Harry; It has a much better chase scene which involves Clint Eastwood riding on the roof of a school bus."
5,Political Correctness must have been invented after 1971,"As long as you're not easily offended, there's a lot to enjoy in this gritty film. No doubt aided by Friedkin's background in documentary filmmaking, the handheld cameras are reminiscent of later works by Paul Greengrass (director of the second two Bourne movies).Seven bucks for the Two-Disc Collector's Edition? Ridiculously good deal. Includes a full-length commentary by the director, plus commentary snippets from Hackman and Scheider. Also a couple documentaries, deleted scenes, and more.I don't like DVD cover but that's just nitpicking. The one from the Blu-Ray release is better, but from what I've heard, the content itself on that release isn't.FYI the sequel isn't even in the same league."
3,Eh... Kind Of Boring,"The French Connection has a great plot, but the car chase is very weak. The French Connection is about a cop, wonderfully played by Gene Hackman, who teams up with a french cop to take down a drug cartel. It has a very good plot that paved the way for one of the best drug related films Traffic and the miniseries Traffik. However, I believe A Clockwork Orange deserved that award. Rent this first, don't expect much from the car chase. Then if you like it, buy it."
1,French Connection,"WARNING: THIS BLUE RAY DISC IS THE WORST AND I MEAN THE VERY WORST FILM TRANSFER I HAVE SEEN ON VIDEO. SOME SCENES ARE ALL GRAIN. I don't care what they tried to do with this release, they just blew it badly. The PQ in a lot of the darker scenes is inferior to a bootlegged VHS tape. Just my opinion of course. The outdoor sunny scenes are fine. If you must see this one, RENT IT. NOT RECOMMENDED!"
2,Possibly the most overrated film in history!,"This movie is terrible! This movie deserves one star for the greatest car chase in film history & the other for Gene Hackman's performance. ""French Connection"" is very uninteresting & boring at most times. It is not an intelligent movie & the characters are weak."
2,Completely unsatifactory ending!,"I have read the other reviews and think that most of the other reviewers are aging hippies that saw this movie in the '70s when it came out. The music was great and imaginative. The stake out scenes were too long.There was probably 30 minutes during stake outs that had maybe 4-5 pages of dialoge. Anyway the ending was typical of the time like ""Billy Jack"" or Easy Rider"". Show the cops in a bad light and let the rotten drug dealer get away. I'm sure it appealed to teenagers back then, but not today where we have 30+ years of hindsight on the drug scene. The mark of a great film is how soon would like to see it again. The answer in this case is never. I would rather get a root canal!"
3,The French Connection,"Maybe the years just didn't do this movie justice, but I did not think this 1971 oscar winner was anything extroidanary. It was a well acted, well directed cop drama with some good action scenes. Gene Hackman is defined by his role in this movie. His character reminds me of Tony Soprano, except on the other end of the law. After playing Mafia for a couple weeks, I think that the game designers who made Mafia must have been watching a lot of this movie, because there are too many similarities to be a coincidence, not in story, but in setting and in some of the action sequences.Overall, this was a decent movie, but I was not impressed at all by the ending, which may be why I'm giving it a low score now. It dragged on some times when it should have just moved on to the next scene. Good movie to watch after a lazy sunday dinner."
4,Handbook a Must!,This book is a must for anyone who is considering in becoming an officer. I used this book as a guide for me in studying for the exam. I haven't taken the exam as of this review. I will recommend this to a friend.
2,VERY LOUSY,"Is this what African-American films have to come to these days?This piece of junk has to be one of the lamest Black films to come out in a minute.It's not really funny and Vivica Fox & Co. seem like they want their check-and that's it!I don't blame them 'cause if I was in this dumb movie,I'd just show up for the check too!"
2,it was just stupid,to me and many others this movie has no point it didnt even deserve the 2 stars the worse movie vivicas been in and the worse movie morris has been in since the brothers just BAD
3,hmmmmmm!,"i guess ill give it 3 stars. the preview for this movie looked really good! but the movie did not match i dont think it was horrible, but it was not the hilarious wonderful movie i was expecting. i think those kind of misleading previews can really kill a movie. it was ok, but ill probably never watch it again even though morris chestnut is in it. some of it was funny but not really funny and alot of it just wasnt funny. maybe if i didnt expect so much from it i would have liked it more."
4,Morris needs lessons from Anthony?... As If!!,"I loved this movie. It reminded me alot of relationships I'd had in high school, lol. The only thing that really aggravated me about the film is sexy fine man Morris Chestnut seeking and needing advice from dumpy funny jokeman Anthony Anderson. I mean, come on now! If that's the case the roles should have been reversed with Morris giving advice to Anthony, that would have been more believable. The other thing that irritated me is watching Monique in yet another role where she is desperately seeking laughs as the fat woman hanging with skinny B?%ches as she likes to call them on stage and I'm sure off. Other than that this movie was great. Vivica never fails to please, Morris is as fine as ever, Tamala Jones is especially funny and gorgeous. Thumbs up!"
3,Not a Commentary,"This book was a recommendation from one of the ministers of my church. This recommendation was made during a discussion of study aids for the bible. He said you didnt need any other book if you had this one. I assumed that meant that it was a thorough commentary for the books of the bible. It is not. It summarizes each book, broken down by theme within the book, but it is not what I would consider a commentary. It does have worth, but not as a detailed study guide."
5,Beautiful photos with a wonderful text,"What a remarkable and brilliant collection of photos are included in this beautiful new book! I don't usually go for the photo gift book, but this is like nothing I've ever seen. Each photo captures some wonderful moment of the French landscape, whether it be a natural or built one. I loved the way Krohn understands the color and shapes of any one of his photographs-they really become a bit like abstract paintings at times. The section of quotations by a variety of authors (from Robert Stevenson to MFK Fisher) placed at the start of the book is a wonderful treat. A perfect book for the holiday season."
1,Memorabilia ONLY,"If you want to know what items like clothes, personal effects of MM, and fan magazines are worth at recent auctions this book is for you. If you want to know anything else, FORGET IT!"
4,crystal set,"I gave the ultimate crystal set to my very smart 7 year old neice for a Christmas present. I asked today what she liked or did not like about the crystal set. Overall, she LOVED the set but thought that the instructions were not as clear as they could be. She had two experiments in the kitchen she and her dad had made and she was quite excited about the results.Hope this review is helpful.denise"
2,Crystal,Do not waste your money on this product. My kids used all products it contained in one sitting and is complicated for even my 15 year old niece!
4,Holds the kids interest,A great way to introduce some science into a child's education. We got this for an eight year old who was fascinated by the kit his friend got for Christmas. This kit seems to be high quality. There lots of different types of crystals to grow which helps keep their interest. NOTE: need to purchase plastic wrap to cover container.
1,BOOOOOOring...,"This movie sucked, yes i agree that it had it's funny parts but for the most part it sucked."
2,Meh...,"Glossy. Pretty to look at. Gorgeous apartments, pretty people, sexy sound track. But, tries to be funny and it so isn't. Tries to be smart and it so isn't. Uma tries to act well but she doesn't. Poor Meryl. So not worthy of her talent.Skip it."

3,Fails to deliver on the promise of the premise,"Strong comic premise and megastar casting oversell what is ultimately the script for a B-grade romantic drama about mismatched couples and emotional (im)maturity. Pitched as a romantic comedy with a deep vein of social embarrassment just waiting to be mined, it simply fails to deliver on the promise. Redeemed somewhat by likeable leads, Streep's occasional magic, and a bittersweet ending that refuses to indulge the romantic fantasies of its intended audience."
1,The most goyish jewish mother in the world.,"However did they convince us Streep was the best actress of her time? The female De Niro! Here she tops even her Lindy Chamberlain Australian travesty. Australians still laugh at her accent in that ""performance"". Here she channels Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie to play a wooden Jewish psychologist. Her ""Jewish"" mannerisms do not ring true at all. All stereotypes and woodenness. Merryl honey, find me a New York Jewish psychologist as inarticulate and mumbling as the one you portrayed. Yeah right! The plot is weak and strained as it tries to parlay a single idea into a whole movie. Uma Thurman is the best thing in this movie and that's pretty faint praise my friends.Avoid this film like the plague. It has the feeling of made for TV at best."
1,Okay !!!!,"This movie was okay, it wasn't a 10 more like a 3..... I could have gone without buying this foolishness"
3,Could have been so much more,The plot of this movie is a wonderful concept and the actors they picked would have been an excellent movie but the writing was just not there. Granted there were a lot of cute parts of the movie but there was also a lot of fluff that just turned this movie from a 5 star down to a 3 star. If you are wanting to see a movie and this movie is the last movie you haven't seen then it is worth it but I would wait until video so you can get up take a break and let your brain come back to life.
3,Entertaining but long winded,"If you read the bullet points above, you have a good idea of what this book covers. Note that you must take these bullets LITERALLY! Where it says discusses, explores, and introduces ... don't expect anything more.My grouse with this tome is that I have almost finished it and still have not learned how to coach myself ""with practical cognitive and behavioral techniques that rapidly change problem patterns and build new, positive ways of thinking and behaving"".If time is money, then the value of this book goes down because it is unnecessarily long winded. As such I can only give this 3 stars."
3,it's a very good book but not my best choice,"i had hoped to buy a book about energy trader.from the introduction on website before i got the book, i didn't found anything about industry background.But in fact, it talk more about stock makert trader"
2,Sickly Sweet,"There's a fine line between the embodiment of beauty and the chocolate box. The higher the stakes, the more unpalatable the pale charicture reveals itself to be. This album is far from Damon & Naomi's earlier incandescent incarnation as ""Pierre Etoile"" and the results are disappointing. It's a rather cloying and saccharine set of takes on the ""sweet tune"" with old-school instrumentation that seeks to contrive wholesomeness but ultimately basks in naivité. There are slightly more engrossing tracks towards the end, but listening to Big Star's original version of ""Blue Moon"" on the heels of Damon & Naomi's neutered cover will highlight just how lacking this whole project is."
3,"Not Hemingway's greatest work, but worth checking out","As I die hard fan of Hemingway, I found this one rather mediocre compared with such greats as A Farewell To Arms and For Whom the Bell Tolls. It is not his finest work. Even still, it contains curiously interesting tidbits of information about the nature of the bullfight, though it seems needlessly lengthy at times. At least worth a look."
5,Great Value--tasty and affordable,"Toasted Rice Green - 100 CTThis tea taste great--mild with toasted rice aroma--AND it's a great buy. If you drink a lot of green tea, this is the one you want."
1,Nowhere as good as the original,"Tremors 2: Aftershocks is a sequel that's nowhere up to par with the original. Not only is Kevin Bacon missing, the laughs and fast paced entertainment are missing in the sequel. Instead, we have a film that fails miserably as a sci-fi horror film and even more as a comedy. It's not as campy as Tremors and doesn't have the suspense, either. Stick with the original."
2,one of the reasons i dont like sequels,well sequels arent exactly the best of movies. Mainly because in a sequel it is basically the exact same thing except with maybe a few extra characters. This movie as you may have guessed is about giant man eating worms with multiple tounges that try to kill people. The acting in this movie is just a hair above saved by the bell the new class material. This is nowhere near as good as the first (i loved the originol tremors).
3,Not his best,"If any other author had written this I would have given it 5 stars. The use of English is, as usual, fantastic, but for some reason it didn't come together for me as a whole."
1,AWFUL,"This deserves -10000000000000000000000000000000000000 stars. It is the worst movie ever made. While the first was a good film that can be recommended to fans of The Mummy, this is some Kiddie Crap (referencing an episode of my favorite TV show) about a punky little dork. They ruined it the same way they ruined Conan the Barbarian, by making a KIDDIE sequel."
3,Dragonheart - A New Beginning,"I think that, while this movie was nice, the first Dragonheart was a lot better, which I gave 5 stars. The plot is good, still incorporating the dragon's heart into the movie. The dragon isn't very realistic looking, though, and looks like a cartoon at times. Plus, if Geoff was growing up in England, and everyone else has accents, how come he doesn't? He's a lot more American than English. I think the first movie had more effort put into it as far as graphics and actors. I was somewhat dissapointed when I saw this movie. Although, some people believe the dragons can spit ice as well as fire, which Drake did in the movie."
5,Perfect for a textured tub,My bathtub has this horrible textured finish so suction cups will not stick to it. Bathing my son became challenging once he started trying to walk around in the tub. These strips provide the perfect amount of traction for him so that he doesn't slip and slide all over the place and he can confidently play in the tub. Great product!
3,"Good as a 4th book to the first Dune, poor as a standalone","As others have said it is good as a 4th book to the first Dune, it tells the more realistic story of what happens to Paul and his kingdom a decade after the end of the first book. It explores the price the Paul pays for choosing his Golden Path.It is poor as a standalone book as it is very short in comparison, and does not have the same scale or epicness the other books in the series have.However it ties in nicely between the first Dune and Children of Dune (3rd book) and answers many questions about Paul that would otherwise have been left unanswered."
3,"Good read, good sequel, but NOT deep","Messiah is a good enough next step in the story of Paul and his family. I would recommend it to anyone who has read Dune first. However, if you want deep philosophical reading, go elsewhere. There's a lot of supposed deep thought in here but it's really just a bunch of rambling verbiage that fills the pages. Nothing deep. Go read the Tibetan Book of the Dead if you want deep thought!"
5,A great book!,"I am always looking for good books, and so I look for reviewed books at Amazon, and browse through the comments in order to select what to read. This one is highly recommended, so I bought, and...It is great! This dates from the 60's (past century) and is way better than the most known dessert planet with Jedi Knights.When I bought the book, I was reading Lord of the Rings (I know what I did was heresy) but I read some ten pages of Dune, out of curiosity... And I was hooked! I have finished books one and two, and I am still around page 200 of Lord of the Rings, ouch!In short, I must also highly recommend this book to those who like Sci-Fi mixed with Fantasy."
5,One of the most thought provoking novels of all time!,"Frank Herbert creates an intricate and believable world set thousands of years in the future. From the mind altering spice to Bene Gesserit training to Guild Navigators...it's all perfect! What a remarkable concept! I can not reccommend this book enough. It will challenge you, thrill you and most of all entertain you!"
1,Not the same style,This book moves away from what makes the first book so appealing. Instead it focuses on the stupid back stabbing and wrangling for position of the king of Dune. This creates a slow book that doesn't develop characters. Where I hated to put Dune down I now wish the planet didn't exist.
3,An interlude in the saga,"With some disturbingly bad twists in the plot, the interesting mix of characters and Herbert's contrapuntal story telling make it a pleasant, though a bit short experience.A must to those who want to reach the plotty Children of Dune and the philosophical grandeur of God Emperor of Dune, the highlight of the Dune series."
5,A Masterpiece!,"THE BEST SCIENCE FICTION NOVEL EVER WRITTEN! This book is a masterpiece. It has every thing you could possibly ask for from a sci-fi book. There is a war, magic, alien races, new, interesting planets, strange weapobns, and, best of all GREAT CHARACTERS! However, the book can be really confusing if you don't know the basic plotline. I won't spoil it for those that want to read the book not knowing what's going to happen, but it really is easier to read when you know what the main events are. The only other science fiction book that even comes close to comparing with DUNE is ENDER'S GAME. I deffinetely suggest reading both!"
1,Amazon? You people are stark raving mad.,"Look, I love Herbert, and I love Dune, and I just got a Kindle for Christmas, so I figured I would get at least the first three books, but, guys? You might want to take a look at your pricing, there. I am NOT going to pay MORE for the Kindle edition than for the paperback. Particularly not for a book I already own, just for the convenience of reading it Kindle-ized. I hope that is some kind of silly, easily fixed error. Oh, and guys? Also not paying more than four bucks for an e-version a book as short as Dune Messiah. If the publishers are making you do this, feel free to forward this review to them."
5,Simply The Best!,"First off, if you have not read this book, buy it now! Do not waste another second, buy it, read it, and then read it again!This book still captivates me after all these years. Even if you are not a fan of science fiction, I would find it hard to believe this book will not grab your attention immediately. This is a science fiction tale no doubt, but it is much, much more than that. At the root of this story is an epic adventure about a young man coming of age. The relationships and conflicts he encounters are told with such passion that the reader cannot help but feel deeply for the trials and tribulations of the young Paul.I have yet to discover a book that has moved me the way Dune has. It's unfortunate that many won't go near the book because they didn't like the movie. If you are of this opinion, I would strongly urge you to reconsider."
5,Quite possibly the best book ever written.,Frank Herbert takes you on a voyage of discovery that is unparrelled. His explorations of politics and religion are enlightening. Anyone would thoroughly enjoy this wonderful book
2,Dont waste your time.,"This book was so incredibly boring it was mind numbing.The first few chapters kept me going, but to get to the end...good god. I literally had to force myself to read it! The only other book I had to trudge through like this was The Grapes of Wrath...and if you liked that book, well then maybe this one is for you..."
4,"Good, but not that good","Although a literary achievement in the ordinary world of fiction, Dune Messiah can't be judged with those premises. It is the sequel one of the greatest novels of all time. Messiah failed to keep pace and continuity with the climatic and geograph pretense of the planet. Politics and religion showed strong potential for a monumental struggle, but didn't really collide as I figured they had to. The role of Paul seemed to be a bit misguided and without a positive stand for or against his sister's corruption. The marriage to Alia showed the farce of power that Paul had to escape. All in all, the themes of this book had to live up to the original but stand up on its own, which it failed to do."
3,I was not impressed,"""Dune Messiah"" was OK, but I was not impressed. It was a fair follow-up to ""Dune"". I was mainly interested in the character, Paul, not in his children. However, I was losing interest in the story by this point."
2,like lost world compared to jarisic park,"This book was disiponting with Paul as emporer he was to powerful and he did not do much himself it was more ploys and counter-ploys. With not as much done in the book it was like polotics today, boring and uneventful. The idea of him going blind and still being able to see was kinda of tacky and wierd. Do better on the next one."
4,Glad I read it!,"It took me a little bit to get into the book because of the (albeit necessary) complicated, lengthy exposition. Once I got a handle on the characters and backplot, however, it was difficult to put this novel down. I enjoyed the character development and the relationships between them. I see why it is a classic!"
3,Great book for adolescents,"This book would be a great gift to a younger reader (age 12 or so) to get them interested in the science fiction field. However, for older readers there are just a lot of better books out there. To some a three star review is bad but this is not a bad book. It is just not a great book."
1,there is no way i am paying $17 for the kindle edition of this book,"are the publishers crazy? i was hoping to pick up the kindle editions of at least the first 3 in this series to reread on a long train trip later this year, but i am not understanding what makes this '40th anniversary edition' so special that it should cost 3x as much as any other book on my kindle. pass."
5,One of the top ten of a lifetime,"Dune may well be the finest piece of science fiction ever written. I read it over twenty-five years ago and it still sticks in my mind as a great and memorable book, one with a language and a world of its own. It is an awesome piece of imagination. I had my wife (never a science fiction fan by any means) read it and she too was amazed by how intense a read it is. You don't need to read the entire set, though. The first book stands on its own as a complete and satisfying story."
1,AN APPALLINGLY BAD BOOK,"AN UTTERLY ABSURD AND INORDINATLY LONG BOOK THAT INEXPLICABLY SPAWNED NUMEROUS SEQUELS THAT RESIDE ON THE SAME LITERARY LEVEL AS THE ORIGINAL.BORDOM, POMPOSITY AND PRETENTOUSNESS DO NOT A GOOD BOOK MAKE AND THAT IS PERHAPS MORE EVIDENT HERE THAN IN ANY OTHER BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.THE PLOT IS BIZARRE AND STRONGLY AKIN TO THOSE OF THE 50'S B-MOVIES THAT WE ARE SO APT TO FORGET,THE DIALOGUE IS LEADEN AND THE STYLE IS HEAD GRINDINGLY BAD."
1,Ebook Version,"The prices that publishers are now charging for eBooks ($15) are ridiculous and makes me regret the purchase of my e-reader. If the prices were like they used to be (9.99) I'd buy it without hesitation. Well, they are not going to get my money anymore, I'll go to the library or look for a good used copy on the Market Place. Shame....."
4,A World of its Own,"Dune is a very complex novel, possibly even TOO complex. On the surface, it's an epic tale of good vs. evil, emperors, dukes, royalty, and romance all set on an alien world known as Arrakis. The cultures and concepts in this book are so palpable, that it is mindblowing. My only complaint when it comes to the novel, is that this book is very difficult to follow, and can be downright boring in certain parts. But all in all, Dune is a must-read."
5,I don't understand why others seem to hate it,"Although Dune Messiah undoubtedly did not turn out as good as Dune, it was a good read. Granted, it had less action, but I am certain that anyone who is vaguely interested in SF, philosophy, or realistic atmospheres and characters could pull through this book, which is less than 300 pages long anyway. Some people closed the book feeling unsatisfied, but I didn't; the ending was, I thought, very fitting. It was also, as mentioned in one of the previous reviews, better than a ""happy"" ending. I thought I fully expected to be disappointed and to feel very gloomy after reading this book, but I loved it, and it deserves more credit than it has gotten. It you have read this whole blurb, you have been a brave person. ; )"
5,Don't be discouraged by the length,"When I started reading this book, mostly because I wanted to have read the book before I saw the miniseries that my dad had bought on DVD, I was a bit discouraged by the size of the book. The edition I had, which had photos from the 1984 movie on the back, was over 600 pages, which seemed pretty darn long. However, I devoured the book in three days--and then, what do you know, I read it all over again. Then I read the sequels, and watched all the movies, and read the prequels, and in short became a huge fan.Don't be discouraged by the length. You'll quickly forget that you're reading a book to rival Harry Potter once you start reading. The characters are complex and the envisioned world is mind-boggling. Don't watch any of the movies first, because they kind of ruin it. Between the adaptions, I liked the miniseries more because the architecture was less depressing.Lord of the Rings? Practically pulp fiction compared to this!"
2,It helps to be able to write,"Herbert is one of those people who have a great imagination, with beuatiful skills of creativity. These people can create amazing worlds in their head, with politics, culture, and a unique language. The only problem is, he can't write. I am an avid reader, and recently decided to pick up this renowned novel. I was sorely dissappointed. With such poor development( I do not mean an introduction-I hate introductions. I mean actual coherency), I could barely bring myself to finish this book. Don't waste your time. This so-called ""Brilliant"" sci-fi novel is nothing more that a pieced-together third-rate material. (By the way- anyone who wants to tell me that writing isn't as easy as it looks- I am a writer, and would be glad to email some of my stuff to anyone who contacts me.)"
1,$15.99!,"Wow, the Kindle version is selling for $15.99 but the used paperback is selling for like $3.25, the new paperback for $9.99. It's also free at your local library. The publisher sets the price. I like this book, but for $15.99 it gets 1 star after adjusting for the value proposition."
5,This Book is the Bomb!,"This book is easily among the top five greatest science fiction books ever written. Frank Herbert leads the reader on a magnificent trail through the life of one young boy and the fate of a planet. If I could only read one book in my life, this would be it."
5,Best sci fi book i ever read....that's no lie.,"I have read Dune fifty times and i still could read it another 50 times. This novel can be read by people who don't even like science fiction at all. Hubert's fantastic vision of mans far future is so real and profound that it could actually happen. The Characters are just superb and so real you could touch them. The Movie by lynch based on the novel is nothing like the book, but i've seen that movie a 100 times because i really love the Dune novel series. This novel is about Man's ultimate destiny in the cosmos in relation to the many archtypes of humanities various beliefs and the apothosis of those beliefs, which is the perpetual survival of the human species. This is a novel to be read and cherished as a true monument to human creativity."
5,On caladan we ruled by air and sea,"One of the best scifi books ever written. The imagination and the planning that had to go into these books is just simpley amazing. Even though I don't agree with all of Frank Herbert's politics, the books are still amazing. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes sci fi even though the reading is a bit tough, and i might take a few chapters to understand still a great book, well worth you money."
4,Dune 2,This book wasn't as good as the first book but still written out very well. The first book had too much description and so does this one. The dialogue is what keeps me reading the book. The story is a 4 out of 5 because of the comparison to the first book. A fairly large portion was left out between books but that is in all series (or most). I still look forwasrd to more of these books.
5,Wonderful book...way too expensive,"This has long been one of my favorite books. A true classic. But, Amazon, there is no way to justify the price for a book you don't even have to print or ship. I love my kindle...but, please don't rip me off."
2,"Good, except for the characters",I heard a lot about this book but when I actually read it I was not impressed. Everything in this book is great except the characters. They are overbearing and ridiculous. It is hard to read a book when you hate the characters.
2,"Passable, but flawed","This is a passable, but flawed work. My apologies to the devout, but poor pacing is an appropriate criticism to any work. You cannot claim the title of ""masterpiece"" and totally ignore that essential element to a good story.I also found the society that ""Dune"" postulates to be hopelessly unrealistic. ""Ohhh, let's put a byzantine empire in space!"" I said it when I first read this book and others like it, and it's more obvious today. Technology changes the kinds of cultures that are possible. This culture could not come about. Willful suspension of disbelief is one thing, tossing it out the airlock is another."
2,Typos in the Kindle preview before purchase left me disappointed,"After seeing typo complaints about the Kindle edition, I decided to look at the free initial chapters before plunking down that much $$. It didn't take me long: '...he was bom on Caladan..."" in the 5th sentence of Book One! Come on Penguin (and Amazon), either significantly reduce the price or get it right (and do the 40th Anniversary proud). Why not give the first reporter of each typo $1 credit and then fix them. I was hoping to reread the entire Dune saga (this time on the Kindle 3 when it becomes available). Now I think I'll just dig out my original hard-covers instead. Very disappointed!"
5,Depth and Grandeur,"What can be written about this book that hasn't made its way into a critical essay, somewhere? The thing I find truly remarkable about this work is how it stands up to the tests of time and repeated reevaluation. Like the protagonist of this story, the author seems to have had a certain amount of clarivoyance. This book bears repeated reexamination and discussion, and will until the current year and the books year coincide (around 10,000 AD or so, I think...) On a personal note, I find the idea of the best warriors in the universe using primarily blades, not guns, to be an interesting futuristic anachronism. Not to mention very cool."
4,"Not the best book ever, but it is up there.","This book made me order the rest of the series, and even tempted me to buy the ones written by his son, despite the horrible reviews they've been given on here. You will lose yourself in the world Mr. Herbert spins. The 2 movies made from this book don't do it justice."
5,Dune,"My grandmother first raved about this book when I was younger, but my first exposure to the story was the movie. I did not understand all that took place in the movie, so I read the book (I did the same thing with 2001). I was overwhelmed by the depth of the story and it's implications. This book is not just for Sci-Fi fans: It helps to understand how cultures come to differ, it is an epic (coming of age) story, and it blazes a trail for those who want to learn how far imagination can take you. This book immerses you into the venue of religion AND politics, leaving you with comparing our world at any time with the universe described in it's pages. Sci-Fi fan or not, you would truly miss out on a literary classic if you just saw the movie, or didn't read it at all."
1,"Fantastic novel, terrible ebook","An amazing book, probably my favorite. This ebook is shocking though, it reads more like a bad OCR job. The price is shocking for the quality. FIX IT!"
1,Publisher Stupidity,Dune is old scifi with an excellent story line for its time. One might call it a classic of the genere. It has been reprinted many many times and one can find it used for minimal cost and most libraries have copies as well.Penguin publishing was previously one of my favorite publishers but now they are failing to adapt to the market conditions and alienating their customer base. While I don't say I'll never buy anything published by them again I do closely scrutinize and have to be moved from an initial not buying position. All publishers are really going to need to become lean product development houses that do not attempt to lock author's works or customers dollars in. Doing the opposite will cause authors to go around publishing houses all together and customers will just acquire the product in other ways.The price of this kindle product is rediculous and it is penguin's fault.
2,You can skip this one. Not worth the time,This book was first published in 1967... so it's an old story... but calling it a classic? No way.Too slow... too boring....Many things do not make sense in this book and it was frustrating to read through them. Move on to another book on your list. This one is not worth it.
1,twaddle,"There are some good things in Dune. But the bad swamps the good. Clumsy writing, heavy-handed symbolism, self-righteousness, unbelievable dialogue, characters even a comic book would blush at. A book that insults the intelligence at every level."
2,"A classic. By which I mean, really boring.","Herbert has masterfully written a deep, fleshed-out, utterly unappealing world and filled it with complex characters who are impossible to relate to. Now that I have read it I will check the box on the back of my geek credentials and never pick this book up again."
4,Reading with Tequila,"Dune was so hard for me to get into. The first hundred pages dragged on and I often thought of just giving up on the book completely. Luckily I'm stubborn and kept with it because once I got into it, I really got into it. The last 400 pages flew and I began to understand why Dune is one of the most beloved science fiction classics."
4,Dune,I thought that the book Dune was a great science fiction book. The book had many new ideas to add to science fiction. I thought that the book was great because it had so much information. You have to be fairly intellegent to understand this book. The book was really deep in explaining the whole world of Arakis. The characters were used well in so that you could understand each of their personalitys.
4,The conspirators gather!,"Constrained by his own oracular vision, Muad'Dib becomes increasingly resigned to his godhead status and fanatic followers. Can he escape from this position and still preserve those he loves? The powerplay of Dune continues as the grim realities of religious empire are explored"
1,We need the remaining 3 episodes!,"OK the Moroccan program with Anthony Bourdain is fabulous, love it! Fascinating food, people, country, love the details on Moroccan cooking. But, OK Amazon, this is the 3rd video I've found with errors. Please please please include the other episodes including Russia!"
3,Read Her Books,"I suppose there's some truth about Jane's unhappy love life. I'm sure there were treatable studies in the ways of men folk in her midst, the rich young men suitable for marriage though Jane's nobility was low. Her brain sure was not low and she found her voice in a certain fantasy, the life of young women catching their rich Lords despite philosophic differences or outright serendipity. Jane simply takes Shakespeare's' comedy's and puts country bonnets on pretty little heads. She's the mistress of clever phrasing and complicated turns. A man who would marry such a woman must be confident indeed.Jane in film satisfies the lazy. I recommend actually reading her work and find out what all the excitement is about."
2,Becoming Jane is becomingly o.k.,"I thought Becoming Jane was well acted,and the photography was very interesting.This is supposed to be the story of JaneAustin becoming a writer based on made upmaterial. I gave it 2 stars."
4,Becoming Jane,"Beautiful performances by a highly talented cast. Anne Hathaway renders a loving, intelligent and vibrant portrayal of Jane Austen as a young woman. The story invokes scenes from Austen's novels but avoids the trap of drawing the whole story from them. Jane's parents and sister Cassandra are admirably drawn characters, as is her somber suitor, Mr. Wisley (sp?), who appreciates Jane's true worth and settles for her friendship when he can not gain her heart and hand. Tom LeFroy is not an appealing enough character as written to account for Jane's infatuation - but such is often the case in real life, and James McAvoy gets the most out of the part.The pacing seems a bit off at times, and some of the characterizations are a bit flat, but overall, it is well worth adding to any collection of Jane Austen novels and movies."
4,Curtain Call for Miss Austen,"Once all her novels have been made into movies, it is hardly surprising that Miss Austen herself was made a heroine of another film. Would she be happy with this predicament? Absolutely not. She was a reticent figure, sitting quietly in the corner of the sitting room, making some notes to herself she would not show to anyone which after quite a long time she decided to publish and did not live to see the apex of her career.In other words if you want to see Miss Austen ""becoming Jane"" you may as well as miss the movie. It is however a charming period piece with a surprisingly decent cast (James McAvoy is getting better with every movie!) and nice even if purely imaginary plot. Some entertainement and some knowledge (very lightly treated!) for a nice Sunday evening."
4,Becoming Jane,"If you love Jane Austen and can't get enough of her, this is a must see. Not as good as her works, but true to the genre"
4,Jane Austen made real,"This excellent movie presents Jane Austen in the flesh, with all the trappings of society there that defined her and against which she so supremely triumphed. You don't have to have read her books to appreciate what she accomplished with her life. The supporting cast is excellent, and the story well written. The period feel was superb."
4,Delightful.,"A delightful journey into the life of writer Jane Austen, whose character's lives in her books have happier endings than her own. Torn between giving up the man she loves so he may help his impoverished family and please his rich uncle, Jane clings to her passion for the written word to help heal her wounds in the real world. Choosing not to marry another rich suitor because she does not love him, Jane hopes to 'live by her pen'.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,Just fun,"This movie has a great idea. And it's fun! Although it's rediculous, but I saw it 2 times. My complaint is that the trials seem to be more and more trite and unexciting. I love the first some surprises, such us bat, bug, and eat-flowers. But the tramples of the elephants, the shooter, the flood seems to be predictable. BTW, The ending of this movie is so bad, I dislike it so! A cliche!"
2,Sorry Robin,"Jumanji has its moments, but you might as well tape it off cable. Robin Williams is probably embarrassed about this film, although it's not entirely his fault. The film drags, the characters are stick figures. Almost dreadful."
4,Jumanji is fun!,"What a great movie and a clever concept! A board game that sucks you into it, and must be finished by the originals who played the game. I remember seeing Jumanji in the movie theatre when it first came out, and this past weekend had the opportunity to rewatch it (thank you resale DVDs!)Starring Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, the action is fast paced and easy to follow. No swearing in this movie makes it appropriate for all ages, though little ones might be frightened by the rampaging animals. There is nothing Disneylike in their qualities.Still, the story of sticking together and teamwork prevail throughout the entire film. Bebe Neuwirth and David Alan Greier are great in their supporting roles. Bonnie Hunt gets some of the best lines in the film with regards to cheating and a downtown sale. An early Kirstin Dunst is also great.If you have never seen Jumanji, I encourage you check it out. It's fun and you always wonder what the game is going to come up with next."
2,What was that all about?,"Robin Williams' recent pictures tend to bore me to death but this one didn't. Somewhere along the movie there's a redneck gunnut playing... the Mexican National Anthem! How come? How weird!(Besides, there's no mention of it in the credits. Should Mexico sue?)"
4,The Kobayashi Report,"This really isn't much of a favorite anymore, but it is still a decent movie. There are some points where I'm in the mood to see this."
3,Jumanji Review.,"This was a movie that I watched when I was a kid. I bought it remembering it as a good movie. While it is still a good movie, it was not as good as I remembered. If you have never seen it, it's worth at least watching it once, and if you have seen it before, I'd say it would be worth adding it to your movie collection even though it's not among the best movie made."
4,My kids went Ape over it!,"My wife and I first saw Jumanji on the day we were due to deliver our first daughter. Last weekend I showed it to that daughter, now eight, and her six-year old sister. I have never seen kids so engaged in a movie as they were with Jumanji. They shouted warnings to the characters, jumped back when animals charged and instinctively raised their feet when floodwaters filled the house during the movie. The youngest has since begged me to let her take it to school to show her class.Personally, I thought it was cute and entertaining. As to buying it, I wouldn't if it was just for me but having seen the way my kids behaved while watching it, I'll be getting it in a heartbeat."
3,what did I just read?,"just finished the journal of Eleanor Druse and had to hit the internet to understand what I just read. Stephen King wrote this, right? It's a lead in to a tv show? I know it's fiction, because the library has it marked as such and the book cover itself tells me to watch the tv series. So...all I can conclude is Stephen King is trying to trick me? As usual, I am intriqued. Love, Luanne"
4,A supernatural mystery,"Eleanor Druse is a woman with a gift: she can communicate with the spirit realm. While visiting a friend at Kingdom Hospital, she has a near-death experience and discovers that humans aren't the only inhabitants of Kingdom. The story starts out a bit slowly, but by the second chapter, I was completely hooked. The pace never lessens and the characters are believeable, especially vain neurosurgeon Stegman. The book leaves off just as the Stephen King-produced miniseries begins, and it should be a must-read for any King fan."
5,A great resource,"This book is a great resource when planning lessons. I am a first-year Fifth Grade teacher and this book has proven invaluable to me when it comes to breaking down lessons into sequential activities. Another larger textbook was recommended to me, but comparatively, this book is concise and is very practical."
1,Plays but is noisy,"This is noisy CD player it makes a whiring sound when CD's are played. Terrible fast forward and backwards, goes to slow. Awkward to use. Worst CD player I have ever owned. Don't buy it, you'll be sorry."
3,works for me,"I have used this MP3/CD player for at least 4 years and it has worked flawlessly for me. It has been powered up at least 12 hours a day playing CDs, sometimes for days at a time continuously. (sometimes when I forget to turn off the player). So I must say it has been very durable for me. The quality is acceptable for me, and I would assume most people listening to MP3 CDs will have low quality MP3s anyway that wont even get close to the limit of this machine. With audio CDs it also sounds good to me.The only problem I have had with this unit is that you can't skip through tracks very fast. It waits until a song is loaded and ready to play until you can skip to the next track, so skipping through MP3 CDs with a bunch of songs can take a while. This is really the only gripe I have with this player/"
1,This book covers very little on AutoCad 2002,"I'm a newbie to Autocad. I was fooled by the previous reviewer, thinking this might be a good book to start out my Autocad carreer. When I got the book and realized that the content is too little and it mentions NOTHING on the 3D part of AutoCAd. I have to return this book and got ""AutoCAD 2002: No Experience Required"". Now this is a much better book to get started if you are a newbie. It covers most of the 2d stuff then has some intro to 3d. Then I got AutoCad 2002 Bible, which covers virtually everything a Autocad."
1,Brinkley is no David Brinkley!,"This book should be catalogued in the non fiction comic book section of the bookstore. I was able to breeze through this book with much speed. It was almost comical how the author built into fact so many disassociated items of fiction. I wanted to challenge them as I read but there were so many. If this were a film, the critics would pan it as too unbelievable to be credible. One must approach this book in the context that what one reads is totally fabricated."
1,Traitorous,"As a daughter of a army veteran and a true ""indenpent"". Many of those who died for the USA consider Kerry a traitor. Our family were there Nothing in this book changes that my opinion."
1,Book'c content not supported by Kerry's military records,"This book is more a work of fiction than reality. As a historian Brinkley's book contributes nothing to the history of Vietnam and it is inaccurate in it's portrayal of Kerry's exploits. It relies too much on Kerry's diary and not enough on the recollections of the 200 plus men who served with Kerry. As a retired naval officer and a collector of navy medals for over 40 years, I found major holes in Kerry's records indicating conflict between the book and reality. Regretfully, Kerry has not released numerous pages of his record thus the truth of the matter will not be resolved. One would expect that if the records indeed supported Kerry, that he would have proudly shown them to the world. In the end, Brinkley's scholarship is lacking through a failure to pursue readily available sources. The result is an unbalanced view of Kerry and his service in the Navy."
4,Good Book,"This is a well written and informative book. I've noticed that some of the reviews of the book do not review the book but advance a political outlook. Undoubtly the same reviewers rated books by Ann Coulter and others as great works even though they are poorly written and poorly researched. I severed 18 months in Viet Nam and when I returned in 1970 I also joined VVAW because it was an unjust, unwarrented war. Many of the reasons I chose to oppose this present war is bacause it is as assinine as Vier Nam. I am not opposed to war if the cause is just and the reasons clear, but any war based on lies and misinformation is wrong and does nothing but undermine the Nation."
4,great biographer,I was captivated by Brinkley's prose. I'm not a big fan of war stories but this was very well researched using stories of the men on the ground as well as providing the historical context of what was going on during the time period. I found this book thought provoking and very well written. This was the first book I read by Brinkley and I look forward to reading more of Brinkley's works.I am stunned by the partinsin comments in the other reviews here. It's not that I'm shocked people have opinions but that their voices are filled with venom.
1,Tour of Duty,"The book reads very well, but the analysis is pure political puff. As a Vietnam Vet, I can tell you that atrocities were few and far between. Brinkley ignored most of the Swift Boat charges against Kerry. He presented most of the Winter Soldier ""Investigation"" as fact when much of it has been discredited.It is interesting to read this book in conjunction with Unfit for Command. You get a totally different interpretation of what went on. And it appears to me the numerous officers who contributed to Unfit for Command have it right.One of the interesting things is that Brinkley never even bothered to delve into Kerry's admission on the Cavette and Russert shows that he committed war crimes, including the burning of civilian homes. Hard to believe he did not ask that question. A glaring ommission."
2,you ain't the only vet out there John,"If John Kerry believes he is qualified to be President of the United States simply because he is war a veteran....5 million other veterans of this nation should be on the ballot as well. Mr. Kerry stop talking about Vietnam and start talking about the issues. No one in the country wants to be reminded about a war we lost. My registration card says democratic, but come November my vote will not."
1,Not a hero.,"Offshore for so long in his first tour. Then back for only four months, received minor wounds, got medals and ""out"" while others slogged through jungle in the real war.....Kerry is no hero. A biased book the purpose of which is to win an election, not to give a true account of the war.Kerry came back and accused our soldiers of hideous acts of cruelty and murder; he testitied to these facts while our men were still there. Some of them were even being held prisoners by the enemy at the time. How do you think they were treated by the enemy after hearing what our soldiers did to their people?A disgusting excuse for an objective book. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
5,John Kerry is a real war hero!,"I find who is really John Kerry. He is a real war hero. John Kerry is very patriotic and loves this country so much... He is FIT to be the ""Commander in Chief"" of the United States of America."
5,Liberals Read This Book!,"A Masterpiece!Reviewer: A reader from New York, United StatesTo say that this is an informative easy read is to grossly understate thefacts. I have been a lifelong democrat...ok a liberal democrat. I alwaysjust assume that all of these guys are just Rush Limbaugh clones, allsinging from his hymnal. A friend of mine convinced me to read this book andI must admit...I have started to re-think some of my views. This guy stateshis opinion & gives you the FACTS to back it up...it's hard to dispute whathe says. I'm still a democrat (notice I left the ""d"" lower case), but nolonger consider myself a liberal...I can't believe it myself...READ THISBOOK!"
2,Eeeh...,It's a good and well made beanie toy just would pay that much again for a little bear like that ...
4,Not a bad knife,"I bought it for an emergency knife to keep in my glovebox for my car, I occasionally use it camping. The blade quality is nothing exciting, but I do think the knife itself looks good. Considering I will probably never use it, I'll give it 4 stars for looking pretty and shaving kindling when we go car camping"
5,The book that started it all!,"I am a fist-year English teacher serving in a low-performing high school (based on states tests scores)in an inner-city public school district. I struggled to teach on-level text to below grade level students. Once I found this book, I felt like I had a master teacher standing next to me as I taught me students how to use strategies to create meaning from text. The title of this book is befitting of its content because when my students lacked comprehension, I had specific strategies to aid their understanding. Direct instruction of these strategies is based in cooperative learning. Hands down, this warmly written book equipped my students with the ability to comprehensively read any text that any teacher gives them.Main contents of the book covers reading strategies, vocabulary, fluency, phonics, literary discussions, the reading process, philosophy on direct instruction of reading strategies, and cooperative learning."
2,RECALL!!,"Well I just got the bad news that this camcorder had a recall & I just missed the cutoff date for a free repair courtesy of JVC. An error code of E01 appears on the LCD screen indicating it is in ""safe mode"" rendering it inoperable, GREAT! I've used it maybe a 20 times and now I have a usless camera w/a tape stuck inside, oh wait, it's gonna make a great paper weight! I'll never buy another JVC product....Ever!! Other than than that worked great."
4,Family member onboard,"I was surprised the writing wasn't better as I believe Mr Thomas was a popular author of the day but I was facinated by the story because a member of my father's family was onboard the ship- he did survive although his father (also onboard) did not. Interesting reading for people who enjoys survival stories, true stories of endurance or sea-faring tales. It was a hard read for me as I know Staff never really recovered from the ordeal although he was a sucessful businessman in Portland."
1,A very forgettable novel,"I chose this book from three options to do a term paper on in college. The only reason that I selected it was because it was not Huckleberry Finn, which I had read twice in high school. This novel is torturously slow and uninteresting. The characters are as rich as saltines. Save your psyche, read only if you have insomnia."
5,Liberty? Equality? Fraternity? Hmmmm......,"If you're the kind of person who knows something about the NWO, CFR, Bilderberger, C100, etc, etc then the best thing about this book is the detail. Very impressive, full of leads, a little scary and great food for thought.Or if you're the kind of person looking for the first time at the possibility of covert government and secret agendas, then why not start here? It's as good as anywhere.Oh, and don't bother if you're the kind of person (see Rick from Seattle below) who has an emotional problem with Christianity. You'll probably get very angry and won't like the discussions about Communism being manipulated towards the destruction of Christianity, or Karl Marx enjoying Satanist tendencies. The author is a Christian but he makes nothing of it: it's just well documented and well written prose, full of provoking arguments and new insights into the historical dramas of the past.Hold onto your hat, it's quite a ride...!"
2,Meh,"This is pretty awful. The jokes are all pretty stale and predictable - a regurgitation of some notion of what humor is supposed to be - not the real thing. What's even worse is that it's an all-star cast, so with expectations so high, it has a long way to fall."
4,Enjoyable!,"This was pretty good! I enjoyed it! I do tend to enjoy British drama more, but as this was recommended for me, I bought it, and it was worth the money."
4,Excellent Comedy from the 1970s,Very funny comedy from the 1970s and I liked it even more now that I'm more familiar with the characters being parodied. Acting is fantastic - great ensemble cast and great sight gags. Well worth the cost of the DVD; wish they made them this funny nowadays.
2,Only watched this movie to see Vin,"Okay, this movie is really not very good. I don't like James Bond type of movies. They are always unbelievable and full of outrageous stunts which annoy me. Well this is XXX. Vin Diesel, who plays Xander Cage, is a daredevil criminal of sorts who is recruited by the government to be a secret agent. There is really no other plot. It is goofy and full of one-liners that are lame. Samuel L. Jackson is disappointing, at best. Asia Argento isn't a horrible actress. Vin Diesel, what can I say? I bought this extremely disappointing DVD simply because Vin is the star. Vin is hot. I would watch anything, even this movie, to see Vin Diesel. He is amazing. There should be a Vin Diesel channel where it is only Vin 24x7. That is a perfect world. Perfect..."
1,not even Rammstein could save this movie,"The first 3 minutes is all that you need to see. It shows a spy being chased into a Rammstein concert where it shows them playing the song Feur Frei! After that the movie just sucks, it has a bad plot and bad acting."
4,Non-Stop Pure Entertainment!,"xXx is no doubt the most action-packed this summer. Extreme sports come into play as Vin Diesel (xXx), a sports icon, becomes a spy, who uses his sporty stuff for an awesome adventure with breathtaking visuals, lots of laughs, and decent acting. Though not up there with Bond films, this is pretty close, and I see lots more coming for Vin Diesel. Highly recommended summer entertainment!"
1,Triple Disaster,This is the worst action movie ever. This is my first DVD that I had that I was so bored. That I wanted to take my DVD movie and break it to a million pieces. Save your money get something else.
3,To Bond like for me,"I love James Bond. I own 13 of the twenty movies. If you make a spy film you have to look at Bond as the mark to match. I just feel like XXX tried to match it to much.XXX follows the Bond storyline to closely for my taste. You have a wanna be Q and M. You have a wanna be James Bond and villian. They do however provide a James Bond like Bond girl. Asia Argento is hot.If you like James Bond and want to see him more high paced adrenaline movie then you will like XXX. I didn't hate the movie, and I do own it. I just like Bond better."
2,A good movie - if you are a 12 year old with ADD.,"I saw this movie with a group of friends - we rented it. We only watched about 3/4 of it too because it was so terrible: the acting is very poor, the special effects are over-used, the plot is full of holes and is not very credible, all in all - it's just a waste of time.I'm sure there are plenty of pre-teen guy out there who think this movie is [great] but anyone with the smallest amount of good taste would give this movie a thumbs down.Save your money, don't buy or rent this ..."
5,PARTY HARD!!!,"This movie is so extreme! It's so extreme it has to have 3 x's in it's title!! That's how extreme it is! Oh yeah, plus the opening scene has Rammstein blowing fire!!! HOW EXTREME IS THAT YOU ASK?!?!? REALLY EXTREME!!!!Anyway, Vin is a highly entertaining individual and this movie is recommended for massive amounts of extreme fun!!!!!YES!"
1,Should be triple s for [poor]!!,Boring tedious bad acting I couldn't bring myself even to suspend any belief for the stunts. This film is garbage. I have 1 good thing to say the GTO looked nice.
3,It needs work,"It's not like the movie was that bad but it wasn't great I have seen worse. The problem with the movie is that it lacked...something... like a plot, good dialogue, better actresses, actors, and some type of theme. I only wanted to see the movie because Vin Diesel was in it well I guess that's good enough, glad it was free, I suppose I got my money. ;) The movie may have been better if they had shown some of Sam's and Diesel's background to add something to the movie. The movie just did not flow. It was like it was a great movie and then it went to the editors they chopped, the pieces feel on the floor and was pasted together good clips and trash. It's not that the stunts were bad, but slightly unbelievable. Like I said it needs work."
5,Sensory and Escapist's Action-packed visual paradise,"The cast is sexy, the music hot- the setting (Prague) is exotic and beautiful- not for those seeking deep and interpretive value, xXx is a terrific way to get away from it all and live vicariously through shallow, uncomplicated characters while enjoying lots of action, well-shot cinematography, and Vin Diesel just being his sexy-self."
1,Shoulda gone straight to the local $ discount rack,"Yikes. Was sucked in by the hype. Holy Moly Batman.It is sooo bad it may well become a camp classic, akin to Marijuana Madness.Big money spent on explosions, cars, motorcycles. Early in the movie, late in the movie. In between, you're stuck with plot and dialog that came as the prize in Crackerjacks.There was one person in the theatre hooting and hollering everytime Vin Diesel did anything. Everyone else was busy snickering at the inanity of it all. In the restroom after the show, people were actually bonding over the discussion of 'what the heck were they thinking'. This is an example of what happens when there is no one around to say 'no, you cannot spend $20M of daddy's money making a movie'.Samuel L. Jackson, what were you thinking?OTOH, from my 11 year old nephew's perspective: It ROCKED!!"
1,Man this is one wack movie,"Don't watch this...vin Diesel is a really bad actor ... and how come Sam Jackson signed up for this movie ...I can't explain how bad it is, It's not even funny bad it's just a head ache"
3,PG-13 action at it's best,"XXX is clearly one of the best PG-13 action movies of 2002. The film is full of amazing stunts,action sequences and one-liners. Vin Disel should have been the new action star of the millenium. While XXX should been his second franchise following Pitch Black sadly it wasn't and we lost a new action star on our hands in the form of Disel.It would have been nice to see the action movie posters saying Disel on top of the title in films such as XXX2, Hitman and A History Of Violence but oh well."
1,Don't buy this crap,"If you want a real spy thriller movie go see ""Die Another Day"" and watch it on DVD. I saw this when it came out to the theatres and trust me it's a big ripoff. Everything in it is Diesel's 007 impersonation. He's jealous for one thing: he's not Bond, James Bond."
1,"Top 10 reasons you saw ""XXX""","10.You're a girl that has a crush on Vin Diesel 9.You're a kid that has no idea who James Bond is. 8.You're a serious movie goer looking for comedy relief. 7.You thought it was rated XXX. 6.You're a student from the USC film class ""Bad Movies 101"". 5. You had nothing better to do with your time and money. 4.You're a first-time moviegoer that was tricked by your 15-year-old sister. 3.You're a critic that's in hot water with his boss. 2.You believe that the WWF and WCW is a real sport. 1.That Vin Diesel guy is hot even if he can't act."
2,Where's the beef?,This is an empty movie. Diesel can't act and doesn't try. Where's the action? Where? There are humorous moments but try an enjoy those on the third viewing. The most pain inflicted in this movie was certainly on the audience. From head bangin' music to bad acting by the star - this movie will leave you feeling empty. You won't remember it in a week. Skip it and move on to something with some meat to it.
1,Is this a comedy?,"Wow, this movie sucks really bad. I don't get the whole extreme sports thing? Is that cool to do an ollie with a motorcycle while shooting gaurds? Is it even possible? Vin Diesel sucks (literally). He just doesn't seem right doing half of the flips I see him doing. And, he looks like a bad transvestite when wearing a fur. The only good thing about this movie was Eve. Her ten minutes of fame. And, come to think of it, Eve looks like a bulldog. So, I guess there really is no plus to this movie. We need to send this movie to where Eve needs to go, back to the dog pound!"
1,Low jack James Bond,"Be warned, this is not in the same class as any of the James Bond series of films. Initially advertised as a new age, or hipper James Bond film, this one does not deliver. This was like K-mart James Bond with horrible dialogue, flat acting, and unbelievably bad stunt work. There wasn't a single stunt in this movie that impressed me, I was left thinking oh wow, I can't believe there was that many explosions and it still stunk. Even the gadgets were goofy and unbelievable. You know its bad when the gadget guy manages to outfit an old GTO with a warehouse full of gadgets in an afternoon and provide a thick hand drawn instuction guide with it! A total waste of time."
1,XXX or ???,"Director Rob Cohen hooks up with his Fast and Furious star Vin Diesel for an abrasive exercise in wall-to-wall stunts. The mindless, contrived plot well-serves the eye-popping action sequences, but only time will tell if Diesel's hip hop secret agent will replace the durable Bond franchise for the video game generation.The amazing, extreme stunts and chases make this worth considering. Extras include deleted scenes and an alternate ending.Eye candy at best and mindless FX at worst. One great avalanche and a listless, perhaps embarassed (?), Diesel can't really save this oddity."
1,BIG FLOP,"THIS WAS EXTREMELY BORING,THIS MOVIE REMINDED ME OF THE RIDICULOUS MOVIE IF LOOKS COULD KILL STARRING RICHARD GRIECO A FEW YEARS BACK...PLAIN SILLY."
1,"Thought it would be good , it wasn't.","I thought this would be a good movie, I was very wrong.The acting is terrible, not only Vin Diesel's but all the actors are not doing a very good job, even Samuel L. Jackson's level is being dragged down by the rest.In this kind of movies the story doesn't have to be that good if the stunts are great, but they can not even do that right: All the smoke and explosives can't hide the ramps they use.Even the ending isn't exciting !That this was such a big blockbuster is a really surprise to me and it's probably the worst ever!Do not watch this if u like Vin Diesel, you won't after this !"
1,Rated XXX-Not Suitable For Anyone!,"With last year's 'Fast and The Furious' and now 'XXX' Director Rob Cohen and his team have come up with a new kind of movie franchise; take some bad acting, sophmoric dialouge, surround them with a heavy metal soundtrack, a lot of special effects and tired stunts and hope for the best.....Vin Diesel was fine in supporting roles in ""Boiler Room"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" but he ain't no James Bond, and as an action superstar in ""XXX"" he displays as much charisma as yesterday's bed of lettuce.Even the great Samuel J. Jackson is crippled by the deadly screenplay..you can almost hear him saying to himself ""let me get my check and get the hell out of here""...The DVD is loaded with special features, but when a movie is this bad, it's kind of like puttting a Lexus hood ornament on a Dodge Dart."
3,3 Stars AT BEST...,"This movie was alright. I mean it was pretty interesting, but bascily it was a [spin] off of 007:James Bond except with a guy from the ""streets"" unlike Bond. The story line was descent but it definitely could have been more interesting. I'd say RENT THIS, do not buy unless you are a HUGE Vin Diesil fan and must have every movie he is in."
1,Bond will always be king of the spy thrillers!,"""XXX"" is a complete knock-off of a Bond film. Nothing is original or entertaining (Eeven the name XXX was copyed from The Spy Who Loved Me). CGI is used way too often, and the plot-line is absolutely dumb! And Vin Diesel really dosen't help the film. Diesel's acting is horrible and film is filled with nonsense scenes.A few weeks ago I saw the new Bond film ""Die Another Day"", and it totally blew ""XXX"" out of the water!"
5,XXX a must have for any action fan!,Remember how you felt when you walked out of the Movie Theatre after watching the first Die Hard? Maybe you forgot however when you see XXX you will never forget the adrenaline rush that comes with it! Vin Diesel was awesome in this movie! It's Jam Packed with some of the best action scenes coexsisting with awesome special effects. XXX is a must have for any Action Movie Fan!
3,"Vin Diesel, Action Star!!!","To be perfectly honest, the only reason I originally watched this movie was solely because of Vin Diesel. After seeing him in ""The Fast and the Furious,"" I was very interested in seeing him some more. Well, ""XXX"" didn't disappoint in terms of that man. However, the film did disappoint me in other areas. While the overall story was pretty good, the movie seemed to drag inbetween the action sequences. Sometimes I just wanted to move the film alone because the drab dialog was putting me to sleep.I will say that the action sequences are on point and Diesel gives a pretty good performance as an action hero, something, I'm sure, he was destined to eventually become in the film industry.I would suggest this film to fans of Vin Diesel and action fans. But be advised that the story will drag at times, but that's no worry since you can always fast-forward on the DVD!"
4,Triple X,Nice action movie Vin Diesel is doing some crazy stuff in this one. Some of the toys that he has are a little bit cheesy but in all it was a pretty action packed movie.
2,Hurt my foot,At first I thought they were comfortable (I got one for each foot)but after wearing them all day the part under my toes start to press into the bottom of my big toe and bottom of my foot. They also did not keep the top of my toe from getting red. After wearing them a few days I decided it my toes feel better without them.
1,The authors lost an unique opportunity,"The importance of the subject can't be overstated. The authors, however, are more interested in selling advice, keeping unrealistic cases without a full solution, using phrases like ""We used a simple binomial model to get illustrative results"". What results? Incomplete answers, however, are nothing compared to basic conceptual mistakes. In chapter 10, the authors estimate the value of an established firm using a current multiple; then, for using the B&S formula, they bring it to present value!! Want more? Just read the book..."
4,Easy to read and understand the value of real options,"The book goes through basic concept of real options and presented in a way that easily understood. Nice examples using both binomial method and Black-Scholes to identify real options value. Also some practical application of real options are presented as guidelines for people who is new to the subject. Finnally, real options doesn't have to be a topic for rocket scientist."
3,Decent!,"Warm, big, fluffy- it's everything you want for camping. Probably not a backpacking type size or weight, but useful enough for the car camping my friend and I did with it."
5,Newest audio cd version is excellent,"Of course, there is little I can add in praise of the book. It is one of the most outstanding examples of use of language, development of character and of setting that I have ever encountered. But I would like to call the reader's attention to the latest audio version (unabridged) read by Michael Emerson for Recorded Books. This is beautifully read, and in some ways enhances the experience of reading the book, because the exquisite language is sometimes even more enthralling to listen to than it is to read. I noticed a negative review of what I assume is an earlier audio version, and I wanted to share my very positive experience with this newer one.Any format you choose, this is a book not to be missed."
1,deplorable,"this was the worst example of american literature ever published. warren feels the need to describe such trivial objects as doorknobs, the color of the street, or smell of the rain. is this really needed? this book could have easily been condensed into one half its size. the author's continuing mention of ""The Great Twitch"" has no impact on the average person's life. this book is a waste of your time, don't read it!"
2,Terrible coloration,"While i love this painting, the print that I received had a terrible coloration. It is faded and the deep blue of the waves does not stand out at all. It is cheap though..."
1,Not specific enough,"I was intrigued by the title, so I purchased the book ""Study is Hard Work."" Unfortunately, the book did not live up to my expectations. There were not enough methods on HOW to accomplish what you need to succeed. There were certainly parts of it that were useful, but the majority contained no ""Aha"" moments or insightful clues as to how to get the most out of a subject. If it were reorganized or contained more diagrams or descriptions of how to study for each particular subject, it would be better. -LP"
2,Thou Preachest Too Much!,"This book has a preachy tone that current readers will find hard to take but at the core of this book there are useful truths and insights into the learning process. For the good student, this book will confirm what he or she already knows and may add a few additional touches to personal trouble spots. For the average to poor student, it may be hard to get past the school marmish tone to get to ""the goods"" this book has to offer. I'm afraid in today's environment, this book won't reach those who need it the most."
1,Hate it,It was nice and in expensive but it stopped working after about a year or two. Next time I will look for something better.
5,Not your average gay movie,"Jeffrey is a fun movie following the trials of the main character Jeffrey. Set in the 80's with the spectre of AIDS over the community Jeffrey swears off sex. Very much akin to the '40 Days and 40 Nights' plot. However no sooner has he sworn off sex then into his life comes Steve who not only is a 'dreamboat' but is HIV+ as well.Interestingly this movie is one of the few that breaks the '4th wall' where the characters will interact with the audience.Patrick Stewart is a very camp interior decorator and is wonderful, and the rest of the cast is filled with some very familiar faces like Signorney Weaver, Micheal Wiess.The pace of the movie is good, and I thought it was the right length to get the story across."
5,HILARIOUS GAY COMEDY-DRAMA,"Romantic, gay comedy-drama which stars Steven Webber as Jeffrey who has given up sex until he meets the man of his dreams, Steve who is played by Michael Weiss. The comic acting and timing of the witty punchlines are perfect. The dialogue remains highly amusing throughout the film. Theres a great supporting cast which includes Patrick Stewart, Bryan Batt and an excellent cameo apperance from Sigourney Weaver who's delivery is spot on! Hilarious and poignant are the best ways to describe this classic comedy!"
4,I laughed so hard my stomach ached!,"I saw this movie when it came out in the theaters back in 1995, and I simply loved it. Steven Weber plays Jeffrey very believably, considering Mr. Weber is in fact straight. Patrick Stewart also plays his character very well; it's a very unexpected role for him to play, and I like it when actors and actresses play against what audiences expect of them. While the plot is actually pretty predictable, the sheer humor makes that ok. I totally recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh."
5,A love story between gay men.,"""Jeffery"" is the story of a man that is afraid of sexual activity in the 90's. A hilarious, accurate portrayal of problems of homosexual men in the 90's. This film stars Steven Weber of ""WINGS"" and Patrick Stewart of ""Star Trek."" This silm is a very moving tale of love, and fear. Jeffery meets Steve, and handsome man, that is HIV positive, Jeffery's worst fear. But soon after ignoring Steve, Jeffery starts to think about Steve 24 hours and day, and soon realizes he is in love. Steve is also in love with Jeffery. But first, Jeffery has to look beyond his fear of AIDS, and learn to love unconditionally. I reccomend this film."
3,Big Bang Little Pop,"Definitely not up to par with other albums -- very average IMHO. Loved ""Bridge to Babylon"" -- don't love this one."
4,This time they mean it,"It's a wonderful surprise when your expectations are bettered by a band. After ""Bridges to Babylon"" I wasn't expecting much, but this album is the Stones playing with passion, conviction and an energy that a band one third of their age would envy.As always Charlie Watts is awe inspiring, Keith Richards and Ron Wood play with ferocity but its Jagger that really impresses this time. He is singing with none of the awful affectation of the later day Stones and is speaking from thje heart, mixing rage, heartbreak and one of the best sneers in music.Stylistically they stay exactly where they are comfortable - blues, country and full ahead rock 'n roll. Outstanding tracks include: Oh No Not You Again, Back of My Hand, She Saw Me comming and Sweet Neo Con.I know its fashionable to sneer at ""strolling bones"" but get over it, because they sure have. If you like great music, played with heart this is an album that will not dissapoint - it's really great to have the Stones back again!"
5,"""A Bigger Bang"" is excellent!","""A Bigger Bang"" is excellent! This is the Rolling Stones' first album in 8 years.1. Rough Justice2. Let Me Down Slow3. It Won't Take Long4. Rain Fall Down5. Streets Of Love6. Back Of My Hand7. She Saw Me Coming8. Biggest Mistake9. This Place Is Empty10. Oh No, Not You Again11. Dangerous Beauty12. Laugh, I Nearly Died13. Sweet Neo Con14. Look What The Cat Dragged In15. Driving Too Fast16. Infamy"
2,"Woah, nothing new on this one",Nothing new creative or artistic. Time to stick with the live tours and hang up the recording process. It's painful to watch them consistently getting worse as they age. Kick butt live though!
2,I felt liked I was Cloned?,mmmmmmm.....Was Mick Jagger thinking of the Rolling Clones when he sang that line? The Rolling Clones/Unplugged I often wondered about that one.
1,Mostly Fit for the Toxic Waste Dump!!,"I recently heard this played straight thru at a small party consisting of mainly over-50 types. Mainly third-rate guitar blasting and thumping, vocals that would make a howling animal sound good, and lyrics that were simply non-understandable. I listened (or really tried to close my ears, but that was impossible), and politely refrained from comment. If this is the best the ""Greatest Rock & Roll Band"" in the world can do, then the state of current pop music is at least as bad as I though. Compared to Brian Wilson's recent ""Smile"" this is a D-. For comparison, listen to the 40 year old CD's by Sinatra/ Basie, also recorded while the performers were over 60, and you'll realize how bad this ""Bigger Bang"" really is!"
1,Nothing to get excited about.,"Imagine everything you've hated about the Rolling Stones studio output during the past 15 years. Weak singing, uninspired lyrics, lame ballads, recycled riffs - It's all there on this limp offering."
4,No Hype This is a Good Record,"I've read the reviews, like I read the clapton reviews. Bigger Bang is the stones back to what they do best. I hated bridges to babylon, Voodoo Lounge was so so and Steel Wheels had some good songs, but this is probably better than all of those. Mick and Keith actually sound dangerous again, not just rich.I know people want the 1972 stones back, it aint gonna happen. And they are never gonna make another Exile on Main Street or Sticky Fingers. If you like the stones, you'll like this. YOu'll probably like it more than any new stones CD in a while.And the new clapton STINKS, at least the stones can still make worthwile records."
4,Yes it is a Bang!,"With the twilight threatening to become a full on sunset the Rolling Stones have somewhat surprisingly (well to this listener anyway) halted the dying of the light and brought out a genuinely excellent new album. It's loud. raucous, bluesy in parts, and overall bloody good. Sure there are one or two songs they could have left off (both featuring Keith as it happens) but there are a thousand bands out there who would kill to produce even one song as good as the songs on this collection.I'm not going to run the list of songs but instead I will tender this advice to Amazon readers thinking of buying this CD. Do not hesitate! Go straight ahead and buy the thing and then play it loud. You can dance all the way through and you won't even need beer to help you...."
4,cut the crap,Strip out the filler and you have a damn good recording. Maybe that's what artists and companies expect us to do for ourselves in the digital age ... for our own good we are being given creative control. But I'm old fashioned and expect to buy something that's already been edited.I think a very good 10-song release would have been something like the following (in order):1. Rough Justice2. Let Me Down Slow3. Driving Too Fast4. Rain Fall Down5. Look What The Cat Dragged In6. This Place Is Empty7. Laugh I Nearly Died8. Back Of My Hand9. Infamy10. Oh No Not You AgainSorry if I left off anyone's favourite track but the other songs are forgettable (and that's being kind).
2,Jurassic Rock,"Sorry, but the Rolling Stones are no longer relevant - unless you count the intriguing oddity of ""Sweet Neo Con."" Try as they might, ""A Bigger Bang"" is largely a bust. It's too bad that Mick, Keith and company didn't pull the plug after ""Tattoo You"" (1981). For the past 20 years, the Stones have existed as a well-paid oldies act. ""A Bigger Bang"" fails to reverse the group's sad decline."
4,Customers in control - how to respond,"This is a practical approach to changing customers and how best to respond. In my opinion, it builds on Fred. Newell's book ""Loyalty.com"" What I found most useful about this book was the practical examples - relevant case studies like Egg, HP and best of all Tesco (page 250). For another book with good case examples of customer relationships, check out Cram's book ""Customers that Count"".Another good point, Seybold puts up an interesting form of measuring customer relationships in chapter 8, called the ""Customer Flight Deck"". Structurally, the book has three principles: 1. Customers are in control, 2. Customer Relationships count. 3. Customer Experience matters. Then she lists eight tenets of a customer.com company - for the most original take a look at step six, valuing customer's time. Recommended."
1,This CD reminds me of a not good CD,I was definately not ready for the disappointment I suffered when I decided to buy this instead of another Tom Waits CD. I was very sorry to see that the early music by the Cherry Poppin' Daddies was just as god-awful as all the other alternative music that I hate.I like mittens!
1,A Complete Bore,"This movie runs around 2 hours, I was checking my watch at an hour and fifteen minutes. Wooden peformances abound. In some ways, Kinsey patterns itself after Shindler's List -- down to the teary finale and participant interviews.There are more than a few heavy handed moments; a lesbian who redeems Kinsey when all seems lost, the sexual predator with a massive hardback volume documenting his exploits, and last but not least around 2 minutes of silent credits at the end designed to encourage applause. But I was laughing."
1,Ignore,"The real Kinsey was no 'hero'; he used stats for his 'study' on the sexual response of children - the information he took from one source, a convicted paedophile's own journal.With such scientific 'backing' as this, the real Kinsey then published these derranged fantasies as fact."
4,Compelling and well-done,"As someone who is interested in history, I found the depiction of society most compelling here - a window on a time in American history when sex was filled with gross misinformation. The tale of the relationship between Kinsey and his wife, and his growing popularity, was also intriguing and interesting. My only real complaint is that the ending seemed somewhat aborted. Other than that, this movie is well worth your time."
5,Like a well-aged wine ...,"First published in 1993, ""The Complete Book of Drafting for Handweavers"" has aged well. I was afraid that it pre-dated computer programs for weaving and that I'd need to 'translate' between drafting on paper and on the computer.I'm working my way through this study guide very sequentially because Madelyn suggests that each chapter builds on its predecessors. I'm looking forward to drafting and designing my favorite weave structures and working with ones I've woven but haven't really understood.""Drafting for Hasndweavers"" is geared for 4 - 8 shaft weaving, although I think I'd feel a little short-changed if I had only a four-shaft loom."
3,Needs more tracks with both emcees together!,"Two reasons why i did not give this a perfect rate: CD is very short. And because they (both Apathy and Celph Titled) do not rap together on most of the tracks. At times, felt more like a Celph Titled cd- which isn't bad cause I am a big fan. The reason why I almost gave this album 5 stars is the J-ZONE produced track ""S.M.D."" Jesus, he kills that track with sick samples. and then Celph Titled rips it apart. I wish this track was on the Celph Titled and J-Zone CD Hog Barbarians. Anyways, I like the effort but next time, have both emcees on all tracks."
1,Excruciating Reading,"For all the hype, (NY Times Bestseller??!!!), I was absolutley floored by how bad this book was. The writing is so poor I had trouble concentrating on the plot, which was probably a good thing.How many times can each character say something ""grimly""? Other repetitions with adjectives, verbs and adverbs (often in the same paragraph) drove me to distraction. Someone please buy Jance a Thesaurus.Conversations between characters were vacuous, and Joanna's thoughts in italics were just plain stupid. Did I mention the exclamation points? That's 12th grade stuff, folks. Who the heck was the editor on this book?The only mystery about this book was why I read the whole thing. Guess I wanted to see how truly bad it was, and I was not disappointed.If you want good tight writing and twisting plots, try Karin Slaughter's books."
1,Good as a sleep inducer.,It took me over 2 months to slog through this muck. Character and plot development is so jerky that by the time Jance returns to a thread you no longer care. The last two chapters get better but it's not worth the wait.
5,Thank God Tracy Lawrence Is Back,"3 years ago, Tracy Lawrence released one of the best albums to come down the pike with The Coast Is Clear. Welcome to 2000 and after a long hiatus from recording Tracy has proven that he is still a talent to be reckoned with, on Lessons Learned, his sixth studio album. Every track on this disc is a winner, the highlights being ""Lessons Learned"", ""Steps"", ""Long Wet Kiss"", ""Unforgiven"" and ""Just You and Me"". I have been a fan of Tracy's music since the beginning and this time around he has proven himself to be a more mature artist in the choice of songs and in his own writing. This is a must have album for any collection."
1,NO ENGLISH SUBTILES OR CLOSED CAPTIONED FOR THE DEAF!!!!!!!!,"Hello, you should think twice to make a dvd with english subtiles or closed captioned for the deaf to understand the movie....you only made spanish subtiles, so it really insult the deafies without the english subtiles or closed captioned. I think that movie is good, but I completely don't understand what it is TALKING ABOUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you don't care about deafies, get a LIFE!"
1,Roth's is the only decent performance,"The description for this movie is grossly misleading. The abusive husband was more like a tortured husband whom the wife could not help nor understand and was led to alcoholism and self destruction. The only decent performance is Tim Roth's who only seems to be in the movie for about 5-10min. There is very little suspense, or horror beyond a few weird phone calls and a wife with a guilty conscience seeing her dead husband. Worth seeing if you are a Roth fan but I wouldn't waste too much time otherwise."
5,Outstanding Film,"Congratulations to First Look Pictures on showing Hollywood how to produce asuperb DVD with neither violence nor four letter words - just a great script, excellent actors in all cases, and great photography and direction.Don't miss this one. A little bit spooky, but solid entertainment.Andie McDowell deserves an Oscar nomination for this one."
4,from an insider,"coming from someone who worked on this project, the fw-i1000 is super cool. i have one sitting next to me right now as i write this. you can listen to music from all over the world, music you wouldn't be able to get by conventional radio. it does have problems, though.the connection can sometimes be flaky, and if there is other internet traffic over your link, the music sometimes gets choppy. on the whole, though, a brilliant product."
5,"Gentlemanly, Irreverent, Serious,","This insightful diary by pitcher Jim Brosnan recounts his struggles on the mound for the 1959 St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds. Jocks weren't supposed to write books, but this college-educated ballplayer (uncommon in the 1950's) wrote a very good one. Brosnan's mild irreverence annoyed the game's overseers in an era when ballplayers earned modest paychecks and rarely popped off. Older fans may enjoy reading about long-forgotten ballplayers playing in now-demolished ballparks like Forbes Field and Sportsmen's Park. Brosnan followed this book with ""Pennant Race,"" a diary from the 1961 season. Some alledge that the Chicago White Sox tried to insert a clause in Brosnan's contract banning him from publishing anything, while others say he was blackballed from the game after 1963 for his writings. Readers may also enjoy ""Ball Four,"" pitcher Jim Bouton's funny and more combative diary of the 1969 season."
5,"An excellent book, not a stone left unturned","While Brosnan ruffled some feathers with this book, it isn't anywhere near as controversial or raunchy as Jim Bouton's ""Ball Four."" Brosnan does mention his difficult contract negotiation, but it's not as bitter as Bouton discussing contracts. Brosnan has an elephant-like memory for conversations and the batting history of every hitter he faces. You get to see every aspect of a game, from the pitchers discussing how to pitch to a batter to who's got the best pitch to the manager's pep talks before the game. Brosnan has an excellent grasp of the language and even perplexes some of his not as scholarly teammates with some of his words. Overall, a great read from a talented pitcher and author. I look forward to reading ""Pennant Race."""
3,Dana Stabenow's other (and much older) series,"Star Svensdotter is the female lead of Dana Stabenow's trilogy about the director of a space habitat being built at L5. This is the second in the series, after 'Second Star.' It was a fun read, with Star now leading a prospecting/mining expedition to the asteroid belt, but it's also very dated (80's?). So, it's one of her early works, it's sci-fi, and it doesn't have Alaska or Kate Shugak. Having read a lot of her later works, I'd rank this series behind both the Kate Shugak and Liam Campbell stories. But, it's still an enjoyable read from one of my favorite authors."
4,JOSEPH AND THE DREAMCOAT,"""I THINK IT IS A WONDERFUL VIDEO AND IT'S FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. IN MY OPINION ANDREW LLOYAL WEBBER HAS HAD A GOOD IDEA AND THIS ISN'T LIKE ALL VIDEOS WHERE ACTORS HAVA A SCRIPT.I ALSO LIKE IT BECAUSEIS A STORY FROM THE BIBLE,SO IT IS VERY ORIGINAL. THE NARRATOR,MARIA FRIEDMAN,HAS A POWERFUL COMMAND OF HER VOICE AND SHE SINGS WITH PASSION,SHE ACTS VERY WELL.I LIKE THEPART WHERE THE CHILDREN SING AND TAKE PART IN THE ACT. THE ACTORS WERE SPLENDID AS WELL AS THE SPECIAL EFFECTS. THE COMBINATION OF THE COSTUMES AND THE WAY OF LIFE OF THOSE DAYS AND THESE DAYS, IS AMAZING. HE PART I LIKED MOST IS THE ONE WHEN JOSEPH IS IN JAIL,BECAUSE THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COSTUMES AND BACKDROPS."""
3,loved the show,"show was great, but seems like the dvd is just a copy from a vhs tape. still worth the viewing though."
4,Go Go Joseph,"I just got the video today and have already watched it twice. It's not what I expected but I found myself falling in love with it. Donny Osmond is wonderful and the brothers are a riot! My only complaint is Ms. Potifar, my 9 year old was full of questions. That part could have been a little more ""family oriented"". All in all it's a great performance, and my family and I will watch it for many years to come."
5,Joseph an dthe Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,Was very please with the product and the timely fashion in which it arrived.
1,I LOVE this movie wish it wasn't all whispered though,I LOVE this movie! BUT! The sound really does suck. It's all whispers and no matter how loud you turn it up you only get whispers. UNLESS you have surround sound as I have just learned. Surround sound makes it sooooo much better you can actually hear it!
3,Five stars minus two for the audio,"Everything about this production is great. My kids love it.However, the audio quality is horrible.The audio track overall is far too quiet. Can't hear the dialogue at all, and forget about background vocals at typical volume levels. Having cranked the TV up to hear anything (and you eventually will), you'll be blasted with a musical intro when the next scene comes up.I find it very hard to believe how this issue sneaked past the duplicating engineers."
4,Great Movie!!! Ü,I have the video but not the DVD I would buy the DVD but it is in WIDESCREEN and I HATE WIDESCREEN! I agree with a lot of you I love the music but some of the costumes was a little much. I wanted the soundtrack (the CD) to be like the movie (I mean the motion picture) instead of the Original Canadian Cast Recording.
4,Joseph is great!,"I really liked this musical. The songs were catchy and funny, the dancing was phenomonal, and the acting was pretty good. The only problem I have with it is Mrs. Potiphar. I like the character, but the dress is a bit revealing. They say it is a musical for children, and if I ever show this to my future child, I will make sure he/she doesn't see that part. Also, I thought the narrator didn't have to act ... during her song with the brothers."
3,Eleven Stalks of Corn,"This delightful little piece was created for a boys' school many years ago. It is a humorous re-telling of the Old Testament story of Joseph and his brothers who sell him into slavery in Egypt. Because it is both funny and heart-warming, it has been in production ever since. Joseph offers many varieties of music, from a Country/Western howdown (""One More Angel in Heaven""), to a French Apache-dance lament (""Zose Canaan Days...""), and a howlingly funny ""Grovel Grovel"" when the brothers are literally brought to their knees. Watch it!"
2,Big Disappointment - Not for small children,"I was excited to finally find this title on DVD. I'd seen the show live in Chicago years ago and loved it. We've had the soundtrack on CD (fabulous) for years and it's one of my daughter's favorites. Unfortunately, the video version of this production is significantly different than the live show and, in my opinion, the music is not nearly as good (as the show or the CD soundtrack). Even more disturbing is the addition of several scenes that make this video inappropriate for small children. I can't understand why these sexual innuendos were added, they certainly don't add anything to the story and as far as adult entertainment is concerned they're pretty lame. With just a little effort this could have been a great family video."
2,Not for Children,"Donny Osmond was wonderful as always, the female lead was not as strong as the CD. This video is not for children. The costumes in the Pharoah's scene are offensive and in poor taste."
5,Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,"Joseph is my favorite musical. It is an outstanding award winning movie that I would have loved to see in the movie theater. This version is as good as any live production. Joan Collins as Mrs. Potifar is terrific. This movie has made Joan Collins one of my favorite actresses. This is the first time that I have see Donny Osmond in such a great role. I really really like Sir Richard Attenbrough as Jacob. The narrator did a fairly good job of telling the story. I loved the songs Potifar and Jacob and Sons. If you are buying this video, you are in for a real treat."
1,dissappointed and read only half of it,"I ordered the book after watching ""north and south"" tv adaptationto another of elisabeth gaskell's book. i was curious to know more from this writer.but this one was nothing similar:the plot is slow, including irrelevant and too detailed side stories.the main characters are not clear and are very distant to the reader,in a way it's hard to care for them. so it was easy leaving the book in the middle."
5,Little Einsteins excellent book,"Delightful Little Einsteins book about caterpillers becoming butterflies.Little Einsteins is the most intelligent, entertaining childrens' work I have seen. My little granddaughters are entralled by each episode of the tv program or by the DVDs.Disney and Curious Pictures have produced the best in childrens' media."
1,Shocked at the Inefficiency and Utter Disregard of the Sender(s),"This book is incredible, along with the two other books I ordered from the same sender: a collection of poems by Langston Hughes and one by Maya Angelou; however, whoever sent me these books piled them onto a single layer of cardboard and wrapped the texts in plastic wrap--yes, plastic wrap!! The books got to my door all smashed. Even though they were hardcover books, they are all ruined. Luckily, the pages are still readable. I STRONGLY recommend that other book lovers like myself avoid this seller!!!!"
1,"Leaked right away. Terrible cheap stitching, quality has been managed out","Beanie Babies aren't what they used to be. The quality has been managed out, so I advise to NOT get this toy. Kids love and deserve toys, and there are lots of better quality items available."
5,"WOW, A MUST HAVE CD!","I heard this cd in a store for the first time and had problems tracking it down -- thanks amazon! This cd is pure piano music, but it is so full of emotion, it sings in ways vocal arrangements can't. I love the Piano music (#2) -- the cd from the movie isn't as nice as this, as well as the theme from the Snowman (#1) -- brings back childhood memories.... Highly recommended!"
2,Okay but short of expectations,"I got this book to accelerate my knowledge, but I decided that it s not as good as other books of the same kind. Namely, Hi-Fi Guide to coloring Comics, and the lettering book by Comicraft. I got this book because its a book about DC comics, my personal favorites, and I thought I would get better direction on how to ""do these things like they do"" Sadly this just isnt the case. The direction is just a skimming off the top and gives great history, but actually I have yet to find anything helpful in it. The Comicraft lettering book gives you step by step in Illustrator; and once you learn it it sticks in your mind. Simple as that. The hi fi book, gives instruction and comes with hady texture maps to give your colors more appeal. I would probably recommend this book to younger artists 14 and below. Maybe this was the age bracket it was intended for?"
3,WAY FUNNIER THAT IT SHOULD BE! 3 1/2 STARS!,"For me, each genre of film has its own rating scale, so when I see a film like this ""teen school romance comedy"", I already know how it's going to begin and end. 'Sorority Boys' will not win points for originality, but the cast's enthusiasm more than makes up for it. Harland Williams is just funny to look at and while the film loses steam halfway through, it is very funny for the first hour and finishes the way we expect it to.The film gets a boost from some cameos by Animal House Alumni and Bosom Buddies cast members too. The guys in drag are funny to look at and they pull it off despite their odd appearance. If you like these types of films this is certainly worth seeing and if you are not into this stuff, why are you reading this? ;-D"
4,Young Bleed Is Hot!,"Alright people I'm going to tell it like it is...like I always do. Young Bleed along with C-Murder who is now in jail, Master P, Silkk, Mac, and Soulja Slim were the tightest in No Limit. Soulja Slim is now deceased, C-Murder in jail and Young Bleed is not with No Limit which believe me is a good thing now. I will admit, this is Young Bleeds SECOND best album behind My Ballz And My Word. I don't know how one could even argue that but nonetheless this is a good cd."
3,Cool Lyrics...remixes OK,"I like Anastacia from day one. She's awesome. This mixes arewhat you can normally can expect, but the song deserves more.., Another round of remixes of this great song please :)Blue Amazon,Tom Middleton or Jason Nevins are welcome.Gracias!"
1,STUPID MOVIE! STUPID! STUPID! STUPID!,"This movie should be banned! Only some sick and perversed idiot would watch ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". This is such a horrible novie. Should be rated X! Not R! I litarlly had to rush for the bathroom to hurl everytime I saw a leg chainsaw off or blood spilling everywhere, not to mention the horrific screams of the victims. How can you stand it? And what's with the shaky camera. Must of been run on a 16mm camera(like the Blair Witch Project). The TCM is all sick and wrong. It should be banned forever. Anyone who likes this movie has to be some messed-up sick guy who likes to watch people getting chomped up."
4,Visceral charge...,"This film really digs into the core of your being and overwhelms your senses with jarring imagery and sound. The transfer of this film to the new Blu-ray format is great, considering this movie is now over 30 years old. Also, the extras and the 5.1 mix make it a worthy release. There is some grain to the picture, especially during the evening scenes, but overall, the print looks great. Tobe Hooper liberally uses tracking dolly shots in this offering, and it becomes tedious after a while, but it really sets the mood--as if the camera is another character in the piece. As a fan of more mainstream horror, it took me a while to warm up to this picture, but this edition is a prized addition to my collection."
4,one of the best horror films ever made,"the low budget nature of this film enhances the claustrophobic atmosphere when the killing starts, a real shocker!"
4,texas chainsaw massacre,"This is one of the greatest horror movies of all time and one of my favorites. Its so much better than any horror movies put out today, (scream, i know what you did last summer). If you can sit through the first 25 minutes you're in for a great film."
2,Had Potential,"This film had the potential to be good,but because of very poor casting it was not.why production companies keep casting recording artist who obviously cant act for s*** in either leading or supporting roles is beyond me."
4,Great classic that doesn't need splashy gore to frighten,"I wanted to give this all-time fright classic 5 stars but some of the acting early on was tough to sit through (particularly the wheelchair-bound guy), but it is still a film I could watch many, many, many times over. The scene where one girl stumbles into the room with human bones littering the floor and being made into chairs and other furniture, and her getting sick and running out and Leatherface sliding open the door and grabbing her.. ah, classic. And Marilyn Burns' unbelievable portrayal of being stricken with complete terror (especially at Leatherface and co.'s house) is the kind of stuff classics are made of. Buy it buy it buy it!!!!"
3,Not a major improvement over regular edition,"The movie looks about as good as it's ever going to considering the low-budget production values; it is undeniably a classic.My issue is with the dysfunctional packaging (the outer plastic sleeve fell apart completely my first time opening it). There was a quick change to the packaging about two weeks after its release, but that doesn't do much for those loyal fans that purchased it the day it hit the market.There is also a lack of extras above and beyond the last edition. Sure, a commentary is nice but where is the making of featurette?! Don't be fooled by the ""A Study In Filming"" segment, it's a novel concept, but it's really just a bunch of raw footage -- for anyone that has ever made a film before it's nothing new.This is probably the best edition we'll get for another five years or so, and it's not bad. Maybe next time they'll do this film the complete justice that it deserves."
1,Waste,"There is no character development, no real storyline of any kind, terrible cinematography, and incredibly slow moving. All I can say is thank god this was re-made, this movie is terrible!!!"
3,decent blood and guts,"not a great movie but worth seeing, my biggest problem with it is having a lame rapper that cant act and 2 or 3 rapsongs, rap doesnt belong anywhere but especially in a horror movie! nothing will ever beat the original!"
2,An over-rated movie that is boring and pathetic.,"When I first heared about this movie I thought it was going to be brilliant and really scary. The film is banned in the UK (for some strange reason) so it took me a long time for me to see it. I finally orederet it from America on DVD and when it finally arrived, I couldn't wait to see this so called 'notorious' film. After viewing it I was so disappionted with it I felt like taking it back! There was nothing remotly scary about it, it is just a film that lasts for ages and is absoultly boring. There is no gore in it, nothing to keep you on the edge of your seat and basically, it is just pathetic horror movie! If you really want to be scared I suggest seeing the Exorcist, or if you want gore then get a Fulci film but don't wste your money on this garbage!"
5,Absolutely Perfect...,"I have never seen TCM before. I like horror flicks and I bought this DVD edition of TCM. First of all I must admit that the animated menu is quite well because you watch dripping blood on the title while you are listening to the screaming people and after a while Leatherface jumps out towards you... that really scared me! The extra materials are perfect, too. Original scenes (w or w/o sound) are added and theatrical trailers are somewhat creepy... The picture quality is 5 because an old film can not be transferred better than this... Buy this or repent!"
4,""" I bet your family reunions are a blast leatherface!!""","This film opened up the horror genre, no doubt. Marketed at the time as the most horrifying and grotesque film ever made, no gore is really shown, but your imagination is the best role in this film. You can hear and somewhat imagine what these people are going through, but you are not invited to watch as a close bystander. Brilliant. The lack of musical score incites your perception and keeps you involved. The first part is in daylight, and the hitchhiker and the remote house will give you chills. The dinner scene with the lone survivor is enough to give you a coronary, her screams, and they last awhile, tend to stay with you hours after this film concluded. Creepy, errie, repulsive, sickening, and downright chilling, that is why it works. Check the next package of groundbeef when you buy it, who knows who produced it or is starring in it. Sweet dreams."
2,Meh.,"I dunno how people can prefer this over the original. It is not suspenseful at all, and it is remotely entertaining. Other than that it is pretty boring and overall plotless. The ending was dumb, the opening was slow, and how somebody could walk out of the theatre in a ""state of shock"" after seeing this poorly done film.However, there were a few points that I found entertaining. Such as the pursuit scene through the woods, and at least Leatherface rakes in the bodies here. Hammers, chainsaw, hooks, etc. All that stuff is here but it wasn't the gothic, dark, dirty, creepy bloodfest that the new one was.The new one was far more entertaining and suspenseful, not to mention Leatherface was much scarier looking. I mean, in the this one (original) you do not know that his mask is made of skin, but at least you figure out that they're cannibals.All in all, I give the original TCM about a 2.5. It was good enough to keep, but I kinda wish I had gotten those three other Freddy movies instead of this."
2,Slow....,"This movie had some great performances by Harvey Keital and Robert DeNiro. I really like the Scorcese combinations with DeNiro but this one just doesn't cut it. This Scorcese film seemed like a practice session of directing until he got into his more later works. In this movie DeNiro plays a wild young man who is trying to still find acceptance and trust in his older and much wiser collegue and caretaker(Keital), but this movie should not be in any mob movie collector unless you just want it cuz everyone else says so. This movie doesn't really hold up in today's movies. I mean i really appreciate other movies made during this era...like Deer Hunter, Taxi Driver,Chinatown, etc......Those movies should all be in any collector's collection. This movie is slow and the only thing that gives it a glimmer of interest....is the acting done by DeNiro and Keital......Buy this movie if you want to finish your DeNiro collection.....but that should be the only reason you buy it for."
5,Greatest Movie Ever Made,"I don't have much to add beyond the title. If you haven't seen it yet, you probably won't watch it based on an Amazon review."
1,Not Good.,"'Mean Streets' is one of the few Scorsese films that is not good. In fact, it is quite bad. Aviod it, but only watch if you are curious about Martin Scorsese films."
1,Terrible for a Help Book,This is a terrible book. I am a total novice in FrontPage and web page creation but have lots of experience in computers including programming years ago.Usually I am the one everyone asks questions of with computers.I was unable find the Button she talked about on the 3rd page. I searched everywhere for it and asked Microsoft and HELP and still haven't found it. She assumes you know where things are but we DON'T. very frustrating experience.
5,Tina Turner put s out a great CD,This CD is excellent. Tins sort of slows things down a bitaltough there are plenty of songs Tina is famous for. I am justamazed at the production and quality of Tina's voice on this CD.If you like Tina Turner you will love this CD>
2,very average,"first of all Tina Turner is a musical Genius,Legend etc,etc...she has done it all and continues to perform at top level.alot of the younger acts should watch a true Pro in action.however she chooses for the most part safe&lightweight music to put out.this album is no exception.i really liked when the heartache is over&the great remake of thelma houston's don't leave me this way.but overall it's pretty much formula that shes been doing already.if i could recommend something for Tina it would be Robert Crays last disc.the Memphis soul.if this is truly her last hurrah she should go out with her true soul roots.she can do most of this album in her sleep.the Lady is bad but this doesn't reflect that."
5,A hellish and scary nightmare of a DVD!!!!,"I think this one of the best NOES movies. It's also one of the scariest. I saw it some on t.v. It was pretty cool. The DVD format is the best. It features a widescreen and fullscreen sides. It has a cool trailer. If you want to see a DVD movie that will scare the daylights out of you, buy this."
4,original,"Wes Craven's final installment (or at least the last one that's been made so far) to the Nightmare on Elm Street series is an original concept. Instead of creating a fictional show, he bases this one in the real world--Freddy comes after the actors and filmmakers involved in the films. It's highly original and really well done. And after listening to the commentary track, you realize just how well made this movie is (Wes Craven does a good commentary). The acting isn't anything spectacular, but it isn't bad. And Miko Hughes (the little boy) plays these chilling kids very well. He does a great job. And Freddy seems a bit more sleek, and darker than the previous films (except for 1 and maybe 2). I like the series, and this is one of the better (and original) installments. Oh, and an interesting feature on the dvd is the 'Jump to a Nightmare' option, here you can go to the different nightmares (like you would in chapter selection). Intersting."
3,really great,"this one is probably the best of them all.when i was about to get this movie i thought it would have like a whole lot of violence like the 2nd-6th.but it didnt.but whenever heather langenkamp's son,Miko Hughs,came in the movie just got kinda......cheesy.cause the kid dont know how to act at all.but other than that the movie was cool"
4,"Try it, you might like it","I'm not into this sort of stuff. Too contrived, I thought. About six months ago I was in Houston, and was persuaded to see these guys live. Their energy is totally infectious and I was blown away. So try it, like me you may be pleasantly surprised."
3,more and more depressing,"I loved this CD when I first got it--I couldn't get enough of it. But the more the lyrics sank in, the more disturbing I found it to listen to, and it sure is hard to summon up the joy and energy to dance when you're listening to the painful lyrics in tracks like ""Drunk Daddy"" and ""Master and Slave"". Some of the songs are also just downright mean-spirited, like ""When I Change Your Mind"", and ""No Mercy for Swine"". I still love a few of their songs though, like ""Brown Derby Jump"", and ""Lovemaker"". Warning! If you like swing and love to dance, do NOT get their Rapid City Mucle Car CD expecting songs like the ones on Zoot Suit Riot."
5,Finally a band with some talent!!,"I don't know about anyone else, but I am sick to death of new people who become famous and can't sing worth crap. Half of them don't even deserve the title of ""musicians"". How refreshing to find recent music that has some sort of quality. By far the best songs on this CD are ""When I Change Your Mind"", ""Cherry Poppin' Daddy Strut"", and ""Shake Your Lovemaker"". I'm wild for this band, it's worth the money to buy the CD. Anybody with music knowledge will love it!!"
5,This CD Kicks.....,"This CD combines the best of thier first three albums, plus features thier best song to date, ""When I Change Your Mind"". The horns section is completly amazing on this album, and the line ""OK Dad, you can beat me, but you'll never beat me"" still sends chills up my spine. The only bad thing about this CD is the song ""Here Comes The Snake"". The sexual innuendo is, as always, funny as hell and blatently obvious."
3,O.K. But Not The Best Current Swing,"This is decent modern swing but the vocals are a bit abrasive. If you want some really smooth vocals, listen to Big Bad Voodoo Daddy or Brian Setser."
3,not the best,"Setting aside the matter of CPD's sometimes uncomfortable lyrics, this is good swing -- but not the best out there today. 'Zoot Suit Riot' is danceable, but that's nearly the only song on this CD that can make that claim. If you're looking for good swing-dance music, look to Big Bad Voodoo Daddy or Brian Setzer instead."
2,A CD with only two good songs,"The CPD is one of the bands trying to bring back the swing craze. They have two good songs on their CD (the rest are not all that great) and two songs can't make one whole CD great. If you are desperate for only two songs, I suggest that you buy the singles or listen to a friend's CD. This is not an all around great CD. You want some good swing, go buy the Big Bad Vodoo Dady's CD. They can play better, and all of their songs are good. Beat that Cherry Poppin' Daddies. Do NOT buy this CD!!!!!"
5,Refreshing sounds that break away from the mainstream.,Growing up during the 50's and 60's provided lots of opportunity to witness rapid changes to the music scene. The Cherry Poppin Daddies have given us a cherry to top it off. (No pun intended)
3,"Great Music, vulgar lyrics","The music is great, but the lyrics are pretty vulgar on most tracks. I would like to hear a strictly instrumental album."
3,Not as good as BBVD,"If you like real swing, get the Big Bad Voodoo Daddy CD. Those guys know how to do swing right. This CD has a handful of decent to good songs (Zoot Suit Riot, Brown Derby Jump, No Mercy for Swine are the high points), but most of the songs sound like rock songs they tried to shoehorn into a swing format. It just does not work."
4,We want more of this type of music!!!!,I really like most of the tracks on this CD. I hope this inspires more artists to incorporate a swing type of feel to their music! It is great to dance to! What the youth of this nation need are lots of dance halls that play this music - kinda like the USO halls of the 40's....
1,"Wow, she really knows how to identify herself!","Hoku is just another dumb blonde. She has a horrible voice, and have you noticed that the lyrics to that song are kinda like Whitney Houston's ""It's not right but it's okay""? My advice? Go find yourself ANOTHER blonde, but make sure it's NOT Hoku!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Another dumb song,I don't understand what people see in this song. It doesn't even sound like she's TRYING to sing on here. All she's doing in talking (in a bored tone of voice) in the same melody of the music. I'd even listen to Truth Hurts over this.
1,How not to write a serious book,"I recently took a history of science course (the Learning Company) by Lawrence Principie, who holds dual appointments at Johns Hopkins (Organic chemistry and The History of Science). In one of the lectures he spent considerable time spotlighting this book and expressing his conviction that NO serious student of the history of science takes this book seriously. It is full of errors; the author misquotes sources and is generally thought of as a great example of how a book should not be written and how an author should not do his research. Read this book but don't take it seriously."
2,Of interest as a historical source,"The ""History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science"" may be of significant history for a reader who is interested in 19th Century views on religion and science (and as such it certainly has great merit), but for a reader seeking genuine insight on the books topic it largely useless.The author, keeping with his time, follows an evolutionary vision of human thought, instantly discarding any thought of the ""primitives"" and seeing true value only in his ""enlightened"" mind-set. Perhaps even worse, there is more than a bit of religious propaganda that sneaks its way into the text, without the author ever denoting it as such. For example, the ancient Christian polemic of Bahira, the heretical monk, is repeated as historical fact with no indication that it is at best pure legend."
4,"a fun book, definately worth it","i would definately reccommend this book. it is well written, has good character development, it is a quick read and quite interesting. i liked how the story is told from each character's point of view. it raises some interesting questions and makes you think, if you feel like it, or you could just sit back and enjoy the story for itself. i know it is fiction, but it is quite plausible, and the subject of noah and the ark is an interesting platform for a story."
1,Horrible,"This is honestly one of the worst books I've read all year. You can tell the author probably isn't Jewish OR Christian just by the messed up theology in this book. He also potrays Noah as a abusive husband, Shem as a son who blindly follows his father's faith. He also doesn't understand that God would have kept the animals on the ark alive (he has several animals dying, including a rabbit [which means there would be no rabbits in the world. Rabbits are unclean, therefore there would have been 2 of them. Kill one, there are no rabbits.])It also gets sexually graphic at points, which really doesn't have a place in this book.Overall, if you must read this book, borrow it from a library. It's not worth the paper it's printed on."
5,Anne Golon's legal battle,"I have discovered that the reason the last three books have not been translated into English is because the author is in a legal battle with the publisher over her authors rights, which has drawn on for 6 years! Her day in court is coming, Oct 4, 1999! There are petitions to be found on the web for support of Anne. As many of us know, these are books in one of the best series ever written, (to my mind). The author is actually writing the final two, now, but has become impoverished because of her legal battle."
4,Great but not Classic,"I am a big fan of SCC and i thought that his new album really showed how much he has grown after his three year departure from the studio. He is one of the best song writers in the Christian music industry. It's a great album in it's entirety but i doesn't give us that one song that will stay with us over the years like the great adventure or lord of the dance, but it's a good CD to turn up the radio on."
4,-- Honesty --,"The biggest thing that strikes me about SCC is the honesty that he puts in his music - you can tell that lyrically, he writes from the very depths of his heart and soul - and he has been given the music to sing it. This album will definitely grow on you the more you listen to it."
5,My new favorite...,"This album is incredible--the music is diverse and the lyrics are moving...SCC is a very talented artist whose songs on Speechless are truly works of art. They are entertaining and they are brave. They are songs that inspire me and remind me of God's strength and power and love. And they are touching...Chapman dares to touch our hearts with topics that are not always easy, but always important.Thank you, Steven Curtis Chapman, for this marvelous work."
5,One of the best CD's ever,I got this CD with my doubts about it but it looked good i put the cd in right away and it is possably the best cd ever.
5,He gets better with time,"One would think after 10 years of bestsellers that it would be hard for an artist to sound fresh, but SCC accomplishes that on this CD. It's a totally different, more ""open"" sound because it's recorded with the touring band rather than the studio band...it's a GREAT sound. There are a number of worshipful songs here, lyrics you can really cling to, especially in Speechless and Great Expectations. A must-own, and one I'll probably give as a gift."
5,wonderful,"wonderful, truly a blessing, very uplifiting. glad to add this to my collection of music that helps me get through the day with out being over stimulated."
2,Only works outside the Body,I read that Aliens like to do Anal probes so I thought if I hid this in my Bum I could detect them before the got me. Well needless to say I am writing this on my way to Epsolon Epsolon Ack Ack Bivivito 7. I am amazed at how good the Interweb is in space but disappointed that the detection kit did not work as intended.
1,UFO detector is an oxymoron,"I'm very upset. Sure the device works fine and immediatly detects all UFO's in the area. Unfortunatly, once the UFO's are detected they no longer qualify as unidentified. How am I supposed to keep believing in UFO's if they no longer exist?"
2,Same as Eros Original,"This product was no different that Eros Original, with which we were unsatisfied. There are beter silicone-based lubes to be had. Highly recommend Wet Platinum instead. It's superior in all regards and is of the quality I was expecting Pjur Eros Origiinal to be. The interesting thing is that a small sample of Wet Platinum arrived with the Pjur Eros order, or I would never have known about it. Wet Platinum can be found at staywetlonger dot com, among other places."
5,OH MY GOSH!!!,"This book was excellent. I havn't read a lot of books in years and a friend loaned me this one 4 years ago and I finally decided to read it and I was done in three days. I read during my breaks at work, whenever I had the chance. I couldn't put it down. And last night I was reading it, it was almost midnight but I refused to go to sleep until I was done. Then I had to get up and go sit in the bathroom so I wouldn't wake my husband up while I was crying at the end. So real and so many lessons you can learn from this one! READ IT!!!"
1,All the time in the world,"The author missed out on this one. While it is a good read, the author mis-uses a genetic disease for what afflicts the heroine. Just another book to confuse the general public about neurofibromatosis."
1,Simplistic in the extreme,"For a book on the lyrics of a band as complex and intellectual as Rush's, this book is a joke. Even with the most simple examination of these songs, I can not figure out how this author could have come up with this analysis. I am a die-hard Rush fan and I still could hardly get through it."
1,I hated and I hate it now,"My sister got this thing, and made me listen to it. I really don't hate a lot of music, but this. *shudder* This is terrible, on all levels.First, there was the ""lesbian"" stunt, which was simply disgusting and cheap. Even if they WERE actually lesbians, they way they played up that angle was just... repulsive.Well, fine, publicity smublicity. If the music is good, we can forgive that cheat stunt.Ha. The music? Generic, forgettable dance. And the voices are annoying and ear-drum shatteringly shrill. And repeatative. Since I didn't get enough of the singer's shrieking out ""They're not gonna get us"" the first time! Eugh... And they don't even write or anything on their songs. All they do is sing. In short, UGH."
5,Russian music magicians,"These two Russian hotties proclaim their hearts to the world through their wicked (awesome) lyrics and beautiful voices. I recommend you purchase t.A.T.u.'s album, 200 km/h in the Wrong Lane, if you haven't already. The beats are ""off the hook"" and the vibrations flowing from their mouths come strait from the heart revealing vibrant colours of passion for music and love."
5,If i could add more stars i would!,"This CD is great. It has all the great songs of t.A.T.u. I recommend this album highly. I have thwe Not gonna get us being shipped also, i recommend that too.GREAT ALBUM!!! ^^"
3,they won't go very far in the future,"Tatu seems to be just OK. The tunes are kind of catchy. I don't think they will get very far in the future. I don't think that this CD will sell a lot in the U.S. I doubt they will have a 2nd CD. ... Also, I don't think they are really lesbians. I think it is just a marketing scheme. I watch TRL all the time and when I saw them on the show and they were kissing during their performance of the song ""All the things she said"" it seemed really fake like they didnt want to be kissing and they had never kissed each other before. All in all I'll give them a thumbs up for trying."
2,Nothing but a lesbian gimmic to sell records,"ok, this gimmic of theirs is clever because they're both pretty damn cute, but aren't very talented in the singing area. one of my friends bought this CD several days ago and i thought i was going to insane because of how they sounds. in ""not gonna get us"" they sound like a couple of off-key chipmunks. some of the lines in ""all the things she said"" just plain don't make any sense.maybe i'm one of the few who can see right through this gimmic for what it really is....an attempt to sell [bad] records with hot girls who claim to be ""in love with eachother."""
5,LOVE IT LOVE IT,HAY YALL BUY THIS ROCKING CD ITS THE BEST THING I EVER HEARD I TOOK ME TWO MONTHS TO GET THE SONG NOT GOING TO GET US OUT OF MY HEAD PLEASE....................
2,Candy from strangers,"Fun, frothy stuff from more girls with a bunch of guys putting words in their mouths and beats behind them. Not really a new concept, is it?""All the Things She Said"" works fine and locked itself in my head for days, but then so did ""The Sign"" by Ace of Base when it came out. The whole of the disc is fine and has plenty of electronic samples and sterile echo tricks to amuse one, and the Russian versions of the tracks are nice little surprises.Though I would be delighted to see Tatu grow as artists, I cannot help but think they are the Chumbawumba of 2003."
3,Why can't a whole cd be good?,"I bought this cd after I downloaded most of the songs and thought it would be worth the cash. I was partly right. Out of 11 songs, I'd say 8 are worth it. However, out of the 8, 3 are just remixes of three other songs! The good part of the cd is the faster paced psuedo-electronica-pop-chick vocals. However, if it had more electronica/techno, it would make those songs better. Also, I have to say now, I'm a sucker for chick vocal techno, i.e. fiori, plummet, engelina, etc., so, I am a little biased for this album. They're voices are very haunting and sound good, but the album is only average, because you've heard it before and only 8 of 11 songs are good."
2,Fitting title,"I think it just highlights the state of the music industry nowadays when record companies have to go as far as russia to reel in the money. Although i think it was a really well executed plan to bring two very controversial, easily manipulated youngsters to our ears. Musically the album is pretty good and the songs show some degree of emotion, i think the vocals are grating at times but that's all down to taste. ""How soon is now?"" is a very tame effort, which was a song written by ""The Smiths"" in the 80s. The record company wanted to produce easily digestable pop and it succeded. You'll love the songs just long enough to go out and buy the album which will be forgotten in a couple weeks of listening. If you think you've created a special emotional bond with the fore metioned artists think again, they don't even understand what their singing (They Don't speak English) Vocals are dull and unemotional. :)"
4,200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane [ENHANCED],"I love this group! I really dont get up the urgeto want to buy CDs these days cause there isntmuch out there, but I had to go get the new tATuCD cause I loved ""all the things she says"" andthe music video which I found to be powerful. Iwas very pleased with the tATu cd. The smalldrawback is that there is only 11 tracks on thisCD and 3 of them are remix doubles, so you only get8 different songs. Maybe Im just a tad angry causeI want more tATu; dont we all? Still I found 7 of8 of the songs to be great and the 3 remixes aregood too! Its cool to hear them sing in Russian. Ireally hope these girls dont lose their young softvoices as they get older and make new albums. Anyway,if you liked ""all the things she said"" and your thinkingof buying the alblum, then just buy it and you will behappy! They dont write their own songs, but who doesthese days. It doesnt take away from the emotion, soul andimmortal greatness of these tracks!"
5,Modern Genious,This album is one of the most engrossing albums I have ever heard. I have listened to it over and over without concept of time. I feel that the girls have worked really hard and deserve all the sucess that they acheive. I recomend anyone to listen to this album and challenge modern boundaries and openly accept this album and get a much pleasure out of it as I have.
3,It has it's downfalls...,"I personally like the album, but since I didn't want to spend my money on something I might end up not liking, I downloaded all the songs and listened to them one at a time. Most of them are pretty good, but some I can just be without. If you like dance/pop, be my guest and buy it. But if you hear it on the radio and skip it unless it's ""the only song on"", then I suggest you stay clear from this CD."
2,Mostly [bad],"Not only do most of the songs sound the same, its formula techno-pop junk. It goes from boring, to boring, in 45 minutes... Its pretty [bad]. What you heard on the radio or on TV is all they have to offer."
5,tatu me,brillant not gonna get it your loss if you dont i love it how soon is now thirty minutes sweet. buy and enjoy
4,t.A.T.u. rocks my bloody socks off!!,"OMG!! t.A.T.u. is possibly the best fricking band ever. This CD is sooo freaking great!! You will want to listen to it over and over and over and over and over and over over and over and over and over and over and over over and over and over and over and over and over again!!!!!! I only gave it 4 stars not 5 though cuz really you only get 8 indiviual songs and one of them is a cover of The Smiths ""How Soon Is Now?"" (which, might I add, is freaking great!!)... So that's it... BUY THIS CD YOU IDIOT!!"
5,Helper springs for pick up,The springs were delivered on time and fit perfectly. We were very happy to find them. Not and easy thing to find for an old pick-up.
4,LOVED IT.....,"i have always been a J.R.R. Tolkien fan and i enjoyed the movie very much,actually i grew up watching it.I couldn't help but see it again.The songs in the animation was beautiful and enchanting. This is a fantastic movie for children as an introduction to J.R.R. Tolkien work,ofcourse its not like the book but still was great.If you are looking for fantasy and adventure,this is it."
3,poor copy,"The copy was not the best. The images were very dark and the movie skipped in a couple places. Nice to have the original cartoon, but copy was not what I had hoped."
3,Okay,I will say that there is won good thing about this movie. It got me interested in The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings which I really enjoyed. But I think they should have waited until technology improved or just put a little more effort into it. Otherwise I say its okay but I think the characters and settings are represented strangely.
2,The film left out significant characters,"I noticed in this film that my favorite character Beourn was sadly left out. The film also jumped around alot. The goblins looked really pathetic, along with the woodland elves. It never explained how the dwarves got captured by the Woodland elves in the movie.But it was good I must say for an overall feeling and is great for younger Hobbit fans."
5,The Goblin Cleaver,"Pure gold, end of story, a must have for any DVD collection of fantasy fun...dillholes..."
4,"I Like it, but it's a bad movie","I've been watching this since I was really little, so its an essentiel part of my childhood. That's probably the onyl reason I like it. The music is hilariously funny, since there's a guy in a wobbly voice singing a twisted up version of ""Roads go Ever On."" The lines are so lame it's laughable. An old family quote of ours is ""Eggs and bacon...my garden at twilight...a pocket handkerchief...""Though the movie is pretty lame, its worth taking a peek. If Peter Jackson ever decides to take a stab at ""The Hobbit,"" it will be the ultimate lame movie. Fortunately, I don't think he will since ""The Hobbit"" is so much lighter than LOTR.I like it, and I might recommend it, but its not a very good movie."
2,"Sticks to the plot, but horribly adapted, with worse music","Put quite simply- this adaption does not even come close to feeling like something from Tolkien. I'll admit, the animation isn't bad (although not really what I pictured when I first read the Hobbit), but if the creators felt they had to dumb down the dialouge as much as they did to appeal to a younger audience then they shouldn't have even bothered, and just let the book speak for itself. I can see where a five or six year old would enjoy this, and if it gets them into Tolkien, all the better I guess. But for anyone looking for a deep, faithful adaption of even the most simple book concerning Middle Earth- AVOID THIS MOVIE"
5,Just like I remember!,I ordered this to add to my Lord of the Rings collection. It is just like I remember from watching it as a kid!
2,you get what you pay for.,The truth be told this was a poor copy the sound was good but the pitcher was very dark and hard to see in many spots. To be fair I did buy it cheep and that is what I got a cheep copy.
3,Really bad art and animation,"Although this was a pretty good adaption of the Hobbit and crammed a lot into 78 minutes, my biggest gripes are the art, which is purely awful and the many songs. I really got bored with the characters breaking into song every minute. A few songs are okay, but throughout the whole movie? I also found myself falling asleep during the last half so really can't critique it on content. Lord of the Rings (animated) is ten times better."
2,"I usually don't care about effects, but they didn't know and","The Hobbit is a poorly drawn together picture. I'm no cheapskater when it comes to movies, but this was really low. The Spider scene was insanely disappointing. And it left out SO MUCH!!! It was loyal to the story, but that's not enough to save this lousuy movie. Hey, is it just me, but when the dwarf was telling his death wish thing, I coulldn't understand him because the background music was so loud. And the lighting sound effects was done by some guy. They were not detailed nor were they down to earth. I hated it."
1,a terrible representation of the intricacy of Tolkien's work,This video along with all the other animated films mocks the significance of Tolkien's work to the fantasy genre. The only possible reason a person would enjoy this film is if s/he is a child or has never read the books. Support of these movies is a tell tale example of the weakening literacy of the population.
1,Be careful what you order!!!,"I ordered this for my fiance' for Christmas. He was really excited as he has been wanting this movie for a while. He opened the product and watched it and it seems to be ""counterfeited."" There are spots where it skips and also spots where it is soooo dark that you can't even see what you are watching. Not good at all. Be sure you are getting a legit copy before you order!"
1,Not good,Very very poor quality. Skipped in several places and was so dark in most places that you could not even see what was happening. It was obviously made from a very old VHS version that was nearly worn out. Very bad. Look for another version.
4,adventures make one late for dinner,"i was born in the early 80s, and one of my favorite childhood moments was watching this movie. back then i knew nothing of the lord of the rings trilogy or any of the novels. i remember renting this movie when several times when going over to spend the night at my grandparents. well seeing how im a huge fan of peter jackson's trilogy now, i decided to go back and watch this movie after what must be at least 18 years since i last saw it. the magic was still there and it brought back quite a bit of memories. the only thing i noticed this time around is the speeded up story telling. as a kid you don't notice that, but now that i'm in my early 20's its quite obvious as how much they were trying to squeeze in. oh well.. still a classic!"
3,Good effort,"Perhaps my opinion of this as a mediocre film is aided by the fact that no video can do Tolkien justice, but, nevertheless, I found Hobbit to be different from the book in that fleeting ""feel"" quality: it's too cartoony. The songs, the voices, everything is great and true to the book, but the characters are either intolerably rounded off to make them look cute (as in the Hobbits), thinned off nearly to stick-figurehood (as in the elves), or dried out and parched ( as in the dwarves, who looked rather like pieces of firewood). This is not epic or enthralling, partly because you know what is going to happen and partly because it's botched."
1,incomplete veriosn of this classic cartoon movie,First the picture quality id terrible & it's missing a good portion of the sound effects. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. You would do better finding the old vhs tape from the 1980s
1,I am a fan of the LOTR movies but this is worth skipping,I went to my grandmas house and she had rented this for us to watch i thought it would be cool that gollum was in it (since i LOVED gollum in LOTR) but i found this movie very disapointing.1. the animation is HORRIBLE2. i was very disapointed with gollum he looked like a frog and a horse mixed together and his voice i couldn't even understand3. sometimes it was hard to understand the charactersi found myself wanting to shut this movie off i would have if i were all on my own. Save your money for LOTR it is worth seeing not this. I found it hard to follow who was who. So rent/buy lord of the rings it will be way better then this.
5,love this movie!,"The Hobbit is one of my favorite stories, and I love the animation of this movie. It is by far better than the Lord of the Rings trilogy"
3,Great movie - bad DVD,"I have loved this movie and seen in countless times on TV and VHS since I was a kid. The picture on this DVD is great.However, there are HUGE problems with the soundtrack. Large portions of the sound effects (and some dialog and music) are completely MISSING. Often there will be action on screen with no sound effects at all, just music or silence. These effect have been in every previous release I have seen. Somehow, Warner Bros. Home Video messed up and used the wrong track or else remixed the sound and somehow left out a few tracks. Apparently the newer VHS copies also have the botched soundtrack.Unfortunately, this ruins the movie for me and I am forced to watch my old VHS copy with its inferior picture.Hopefully sometime soon Warner will release a corrected version. Until then, buy a used VHS copy if you want to see the movie properly."
2,Disappointed...,"What a bummer. First off, it was late getting here even though it was sent 2-day Prime. So it barely made it for Christmas. The worst part is the poor quality of the DVD. It skipped in SEVERAL places. Brand new out of the case, first time in the player, and it skipped. The quality of the movie is awful too. You'd think if it was that bad to begin with, it wouldn't have been transferred to a DVD to begin with... :/"
2,Poor Quality,The DVD quality was poor. A lot of the scenes were too dark to see and the scenes would skip brief moments of the movie or replay moments of the movie. Overall it was a very poorly produced DVD.
1,Terrible Quality,"I was so excited to get this dvd and share it with my son, as it was one of my favorites growing up. I was terribly disappointed in it when it came. The color quality is awful, the darker scenes, like Gollum's cave, are so faded out you can barely see it. The soundtrack is missing in places, the special effects (Smaug's fire, Sting's vortex sound, etc) are completely missing. They repeat themselves in places. Utterly let down."
3,Great story...mediocre animation,"I love the whole Tolkien Ring Cycle, but it has never gotten the presentation on film it deserves. It is presented here as rather silly and without really great animation. I am still waiting for the really great film treatment it deserves. This may be adequate for children, but will leave the discerning adult yearnng for somethng better."
3,"Hey, at least they tried!","If you're a big fan of Tolkien, this version of ""The Hobbit"" will probably be a big disappointment. I just don't feel they did a good job of capturing Middle Earth. The soundtrack is awful, Gollum is awful, and the elves look like evil gnomes! On the positive side, I liked Gandalf & the Dwarves OK. They also changed some of the plot for no good reason."
4,A Good Movie If you are Young.,"This movie is ok,but it is more focused on littler kids.You can tell that it is by the songs and stuff. This movie doesent really go indepth on some of the key events that happen in the book.But if you dident know about all those events it's a good movie.So I sugjest that you watch the movie before you read the book, but make sure you read the book.This movie is a great gift for a younger brother or sister."
1,"Ugly Video, Missing Sound Effects and Skips: A Rip-off!","I hope this review gets posted in time to warn fans of the original release to AVOID this copy. My college-age sons and I have been Hobbit fans since their toddler days when watched our original VHS tape until they had it memorized (dialog, songs and sound effects) and our tape disintegrated.Seeing Peter Jackson's version made us remember the simple joys of watching the Rankin & Bass production together in our younger days.I purchased this VHS thinking that it was going to be like our tape of old, you know, with a watchable picture, clear sound, wonderful sound effects.This version is a mess. The picture was dark and murky. Several skips interrupted what could be seen. Worst of all, the wonderful sound effects that enriched the key scenes in the story are missing from this VHS tape.Pleas, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this miserable copy!"
5,Classic,I remember this from my early teens. This is comfort food on celluoid. I have the vhs version and wouldnt give it up for any fancy DVD or super duper Blu-Ray version. There is an ambience with vhs that is lost in digital. I have stacked duel vcr players plus a back up built in the TV. Anyway get the movie and be a kid again-good stuff!!
1,Not worth a look,"Poor qualitity, leaves a lot to be desired, purchased for my son who was really young even he could not watch it"
2,"Great version, small print","I bought this bible, because I was wanting a good everyday devotional bible. I love the way that ESV puts things. I was very imressed with the cover. Great details. However, the print is too small for every day use in my opinion. I gave my copy to my mom, and she seems to really like it. So, if you're concerned about print size, check out the TruTone Personal Size Reference Bible. It is slightly larger and has bigger print without being bulky."
3,small font!,"for someone just over 40, consider the font of this Bible - just too samll to read. otherwise, this would be the absolute perfect pocket Bible. the translation is wonderful."
3,Grippy Little Orange ESV for Microscope Owners,I like how small and rugged it is. It would be my preferred bible except that the 7 point font is unreadable unless I hold it about six inches from my eyes. Others may not mind.
3,A little too small,"This is a beautiful Bible with a nice cover and a great translation, but this compact Bible is way too small for any real use. The type is so little that it is very difficult to read, and the proportions in the picture are misleading because it is quite a bit smaller than the regular thinline Bible which is what I intended to purchase."
5,Holy Bible,How can anyone live without it - it was a gift for my daughter and she seems to love it - i may have to order one for myself in the near future
5,"Fantastic, concise Bible!","I purchased this ESV Bible because I wanted something small and portable, as well as a good, practical, readable translation. This print is excellent, the font is clear and not too small. The leather cover being soft gives the book an elasticity while not being too floppy. I have truly enjoyed my first few weeks of using this Bible and recommend it to everyone."
4,No Surprises,"You get what you pay for. Looks nice and is very basic, seems to be made pretty well. Two things I wish it had are red letter writing for Jesus' words, and a built in book mark ribbon."
3,Handy,"For large print, the print is pretty small, but still, I like it okay. Fits in my coat pocket. Nice feel to it."
4,Small and adorable!,I love this bible. It's nice because it just looks like any other book. Also I must not have read all the way but it is ESV which is fine. It was exactly what was described! It's very lightweight and can be carried in a purse which is nice.
4,BEAUTIFUL!!,"THE ART WORK ON THE COVER IS VERY DETAILED!! THE PRINT IS NOT HARD TO READ - AND THE PORTABLE SIZE MAKES IT EASY TO CARRY AND FELLOWSHIP!! I ORIGINIALLY PURCHASED THIS BIBLE FOR MY SISTER, AND UPON DELIVERY, REALIZED I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE EXACT SAME ONE FOR MYSELF!!!"
1,GOOD BOOK,"GOOD BOOK-- GOOD COVER, PRINT WAS TOO SMALL FOR ME .... MORE OF A CHURCH PEW BIBLE.. NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.. WOULD RECOMMEND BUT NOT FOR ME"
2,Tiny Font,I bought the ESV single column legacy imitation leather Bible based on the stated font size of 9 points. When I received the Bible I could barely read the text even with reading glasses. I could not read the even smaller footnotes.I measured the capital letters and found them to be 0.090 inch high. According to Wikipedia the current font standard is 1 point = 1/72 inch. That should make a 9 point font 0.125 inch high. Even the old font standard has the 9 point font in the 0.125 inch range.Other than the font the Bible seems to have good quality. Use of the very large margins should allow the publisher to use a full 9 point font without increasing the page count.The Bible was promptly returned.
3,"""Large"" may be overstated","The print is larger than most of the Bibles we have owned and used over the decades. However, it is signfiicantly smaller than we had hoped for. Now that we know, we will be seeking ""GIANT"" print."
2,LARGE PRINT BIBLE,"THE LARGE PRINT WORDS VERY LIGHT, LIKE ITALICS. NEEDS BOLD PRINT FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED LARGE PRINT."
3,important notice,"I'm sure this product would help and the price is right. But,...I had to return it because it wouldn't fit on my truck. What they don't tell you is that this product will only fit if your leaf springs are under the axle."
4,Acessing One's iPod,The Yamaha YDS10 Universal iPod Dock works well with my Yamaha RX-E410 receiver. It was easy to connect and works seamlessly with my iPod.
3,Nice gift for grandma,"I bought the Minolta Freedom 70QD this month for my mother-in-law as a Mother's day gift. She has been looking for an easy-to-use camera with features including Zoom and Date, but doesn't want fancy stuffs that require learning. She doesn't like the digital ones as she is the traditional user who wants to keep the photos in the photo albums instead of in the computer. This camera just fits her need, with a reasonable price (cheaper than other comparable brands). Film loading is easy, as she has already taken 2 rolls of films without problem, but she complains that it is not smooth to open or close the lid. The quality of the photos is acceptable for this price. Recommend to use ISO 400 film, particularly for indoors. Not recommended to shoot moving object, which is a limitation for most point & shoot cameras."
5,Totemo Sugoi!,"Lady in Gil is a maginificent book that has captured me like books used to when I was little. Growing up my mind became more critical of fantasy worlds, and I began to enjoy the genre much less. However, this has caught my attention like Lord of the Rings once did. The attention to detail is phenomenal, without being boring. I would strongly reccomend anyone pick up this book without hesitation, as its uncommon hero and the world he lives in will not fail to please any fan of fantasy novels."
2,Could have been better.,I'm sorry to say I read about half of it until I gave up and skipped to the end and partially read the last chapter.I dont know what it was about the book that just didn't keep me hooked. Thankfully I got it from the library so it didn't cost me anything.Hopefully Sigaloff's next book will entertain me more.
4,Finally I have a copy,My dog's breeder recommended this title when I began exploring raw food. It took some time to locate it. I was very glad to see it released on Kindle!
5,Hotlanta's Finest,"These guys have the kind of raw talent only found in the DIRTY SOUTH. They are definetly off the chains. I really enjoyed the down south flow and blazing beats. For true Southern rap fans, you'll have no problem recognizing a rap classic such as this one. Oh yeah, Sean Paul is a God."
2,Paint drying on cedars,"I was disappointed with the film version of David Guterson's book, which I loved. The movie moved so slow, even though I knew the outcome, which I won't give away. The cinematography was wonderful, however. There just seemed to be something missing from the story. After I finished watching, I felt like I hadn't watched it. It just ended. There was no climactic ending at all. I thought it very boring with no emotional qualities. My advice: READ THE BOOK instead!"
3,Worth seeing even if you have read the book,"I know some critics have praised the film adaptation for it's strong resemblance to Guterson's novel, but I was less impressed as I thought Guterson's novel already read like a screenplay. In fact, I thought the film betrayed the book by portraying Hatsue's husband as a harsher and more distant man than his literary counterpart, in an attempt, I'm guessing, to win over the white males in the audience. The highlights of the film for me include the gorgeous cinematography, and Max von Sydow's perfect portrayal of the decrepit but experienced defence lawyer. Scott Hicks' flashy direction also kept things interesting, which was helpful, as I was already familiar with the story."
1,"Shallow, Pedestrian","Strip away the beautiful scenery and what's left is a shallow, pedestrian take on...nothing. There isn't a well-drawn character in the bunch. The movie is ostensibly about Ethan ""hole-in-a-movie"" Hawk's transformation from a wounded, lovelorn child into a do-the-right-thing man, but the moral dilemma he resolved was trivial, and 90% of human beings, ... would have resolved it in the same way, but a lot sooner and with less grief for others."
3,Not a winner.,"This was the most disappointing of the many ""adventures"" of Sherlock Holmes I've read. The writer seems to be trying set himself above the original author who created Holmes but Conan Doyle would never have used such sarcasm. The most unforgivable remarks were his denigrating treatment of Dr. Watson. Boo, hiss and no accolades for Michael Hardwick from this reader! Would not recommend this writer to anyone."
2,Arrows song is killer but nothing else was real impressive,"Im not writing this review to disparriage the band or the cd, its decent rock n roll and worthy attempt, but after listening to the album in its enirety I felt compelled to write this review because it did not live up to my expectations. I too heard the song Arrows on Pandora and that is why I bought the album. However the other songs didnt have the energy of Arrows and most of them failed to get me excited to what I was listening to. Triggerfinger and Barricades are decent songs but overall the lead singers voice fails to flow smoothly with the aggresive play of the guitars and only Arrows has a really fresh, polished sound that makes you yearn for more"
4,"Amazing series, less than stellar picture quality","My husband and I are great fans of David Attenborough's nature documentaries and love this amazing series on birds. Unfortunately, I have to take one star off for the poor picture quality that does not do justice to the beauty of the birds and their natural surroundings. The colors are rather washed out giving it the appearance of a much older production (like the shows made in the 70s and 80s). This is a pity as such an amazing production which has obviously been meticulously researched deserves better treatment.There are 10 episodes on 3 discs:Disc OneTo Fly or Not to FlyThe Mastery of FlightThe Insatiable AppetiteDisc TwoMeat-EatersFishing for a LivingSignals and SongsDisc ThreeFinding PartnersThe Demands of the EggThe Problems of ParenthoodThe Limits of EnduranceAspect ratio is 1.33:1, in English with interactive menus and scene access. Fans of David Attenborough will want to own this set, but do take note of the inferior picture quality."
3,THE LIFE OF BIRDS BY DAVID ATTENBOROUGH,"of course, everyone including amateur birders loved this video; i am itching to buy it but i'm gonna wait, because what would be really awsome is this video on DVD... for crying out loud, get with it people- VHS is soooo eighties!"
3,Video Quality Very Poor,The information in the video is very interesting and educational--but the video quality looks terrible on our HDTV! One of the reasons I purchased it was because I was expecting it to be similar in video quality to Planet Earth. It definitely isn't. I hope someday they will release a version that looks better than these DVDs.My rating system: 5 stars for educational quality. 1 star for video quality. It averages out to 3 stars.
5,geat sound!,I bought this exhaust for my wifes 2006 dodge ram. It fit great and the sound is incredible. It's a quality partThe stainless steel body will probably outlast the truck. I would even say I gained a few horsepower. All in all this is a great product and I wouldn't hesitate to buy from this seller again.
2,Failed me when I needed it.,"This product failed me. It wasn't warm enough fast enough for 10F weather in a camper. I bought it for low power consumption, but a smarter idea would have been to buy one with adjustable heat setting which I could have turned down. THis one has no adjustability so either leave it on or unplug it... but no matter what you do it will never keep you warm in extreme cold and isn't large enough for a single person. It's smaller than it seems when you factor in that it has to wrap around the body in a 3D fashion and that takes a lot more than the width of your body."
1,Worked great at first,I bought the electric blanket for my husband because he is an over the road truck driver. He had one he had bought at a truck stop but it was getting worn out. The blanket worked for 2 weeks. He just informed me that it quit working - there is no heat at all coming from it. I am very disappointed.
1,Don't waste your money,"This lens set will fit the Canon 650A according to the seller. What it fits is the adapter tube you buy from them. Poor quality and not worth the money. Cost too high in restock fees to return. Gave it one star because they look cool. If you like the circular corner cropping, well these are the lenses for you as long as picture quality doesn't matter. Buy a decent set. Keep shopping."
5,Nostalgia,"Great product for my brother - memories of childhood, watching tv, playing games, collecting the toys. Amazing to find the whole box set for such a great price. He was thrilled."
5,A very cute movie!,"This is a great movie for the whole family, cute and funny. Brendan fraser is absolutely adorable in this role. Definately one of my favorites!"
2,Brief on Explanations,"I've been going through this book page by page for the last seven months with my child (who is a straight A student) and we both find this book to be very short on explanations. IF you're using this book just for practice problems in conjunction with classroom teaching, then the textbook would be fine. I find that there is very little in the way of explanations, and what explanations of concepts that is present, is very brief and less than clear. The book does have a lot of practice problems (1/2 of which have the answer in the back)."
3,The messenger delivered,"The story of Joan of Arc as portrayed in ""The Messenger"" is highly uplifting and deeply moving despite some of the most akward scenes, and the many errors with the story. The way that Milla potrayed Joan was on my account moving to the point where it has pushed me in new heights with my beliefs about God and how I react on a whole. She showed a Joan of Arc that was a teen, a loyal follower of God, and a fighter till the end. She poytrayed a Joan that in my opinion is a role model in the fact that she practiced what she preached, followed her heart and faith until the very end of her life. The only part of the movie I really didn't like was the rape scene really made me sick. The fact that they put that in there and it didn't really happen was kinda disturbing. The movie in a whole is good, and is definatly rentworthy or a good purchase."
3,A Tale of Revenge and Madness,"It is hard to say if this is a good movie or not. What confuses the issue is that it purports to be the story of Joan of Arc, which it is not. So I ask myself, is it a good movie if we change all the names?. And I would have to say, yes, it's a good story. Implausible perhaps, but gripping, scary, weird, dramatic: a psychological study of frenzied revenge ending in insight, repentance and inner peace. But as a dramatization of the life of Joan of Arc it is a flop, an ""F"", a Zero. The Milla Jovovich character is as far from the winsome, simple, and tenderhearted peasant girl as the East is from the West. For those of you who want to learn about the real Joan, there is a wealth of information including extensive first hand accounts from the Trial of Nullification. It is well worth the effort. Joan's life is one of the most incredible in all history, very moving and thought provoking."
3,A visual stunner with impressive battle scenes.,"Milla Jovovich is the titular heroine who believes she's a messenger from God who's come to free the French from English tyranny. Luc Besson's interpretation of the legendary historical figure is visually impressive and the battle sequences are bloody and exciting. Unfortunately, the story is muddled, the film is pretentious, and scenes meant to come across as deep sometimes come across as goofy and campy. Good performances across the map, with Jovovich faring quite well in a rather maniacal portrayal. Mostly middling material, with occasional excellence. If you're looking for a Medieval period, battle-filled epic, you could do a lot worse, but Braveheart is still THE clashing-sword masterpiece.** 1/2 out of *****"
2,I have seen better versions of Joan D'Arc,"It is definitely a Hollywood version. They have changed a lot the real history of Joan D'Arc. I don't think that Joan of Arc was angry all the time like they present her in the movie. Joan, according to the story heard voices from three saints, St. Catherine, St. Margaret and St. Michael. But in the movie they present three images and they never speak. Is like the same angel or saint in three different ages. The movie has more o less a slow pace and it turns really boring after 3/4 parts of the movie had elapsed. I think the version of Joan of Arc, starred by Lelee Sobieski is more loyal to what really happened than this one. Even the one in black & white with Ingrid Bergman was even better than this one."
2,INCREDIBLE BUT TRUE ! THIS MOVIE IS ALMOST FRENCH !,"I'm french and i've seen this movie with french language in zone 2 ! But without ten additionnal minutes Mister Luc Besson, a frenchie as much as me do not want make a complete movie for my country ! Is it normal ? No ! Sure ! In the same movie LEON whitch he as created ! Mister Luc BESSON don't like the Fenchmen MOVIES ? OUTLANDISH !!!"
1,Not True to History or Joan of Arc,"Save your time and money - avoid this movie.I have studied the life of Joan of Arc and was extremely disappointed by this movie. The Messenger portrays Joan as a mental case who was unsure of herself and full of doubts. The record is clear that the real Joan was confident in her faith and in ""her voices.""Also the movie has many scenes of graphic violence that are purely gratuitous and unnecessary. Yes war is violent but to include scenes of a head exploded by a giant wreaking ball adds nothing.I do not recommend this movie to anyone who is serious about learning about Joan of Arc.Get the 1948 Ingrid Bergman movie - it is much closer to the true story.For the best version of the real story, read Mark Twain's book.This movie is an insult to a young woman who is quite possibly the most remarkable person who ever lived (aside from Jesus)."
1,Painful to watch!!!,"What is with all of the screeching and yelling?? I got so tired of it I had to FF through the last half of the movie. The best part is when they finally burned her at the stake! I knew she could scream no longer... What was Dustin doing playing Obe Wan? I must have missed something but could not stand to go back and look! I love history and the legend of Joan, this fell short. I would not recommend this movie to anyone!!! Unless you are deaf..."
1,A Saint???,The woman in this movie was no saint. How can anybody who signs their faith over to save their own neck be a saint? And then she goes and admits that she did everything for her own revenge. Was God in this movie at all??? I doubt it. The devil was in it though and Joan surely goes straight to Hell after she is killed. I was expecting an uplifting movie about a woman of God. Instead I got a movie about some nut.
1,"pathetic, horrible","My biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't give any rhyme or reason as to why anyone, least of all the King, would follow her. It does not explain how Joan became known as the Maid of Lorraine or why the ""peasants"" would love her. She acted pretty much psychotic and very high-strung throughout the entire movie(based on the fact that she saw her sister raped even though this is not historical). The woman in that movie noone would have followed.My other major problem with the movie is the ""visions"". They made absolutely no sense, and instead of getting a sense of ""God"" (goodness,light,etc). You just get a dark feeling. . . .ugh . . ."
1,French Garbage,"This review may sound pretentious and ignorant, but in truth I'm a big fan of British history, so bear with me!Even as a film itself, it's surreal, and I don't like the acting. But as with any historical film that includes the British, they're made out to be the absolute bad guys! Sure we were forging an empire within France (i.e. The Hundred Years War), but rapists and murdering pillagers!? Never!Historically accurate, full of British sentiment, and down-right weird. Avoid this film today, folks!"
4,If I had wanted accuracy I'd have read a history book.,"Before watching MESSENGER I read the mixed reviews and expected a disappointing effort. To be truthful I expected to watch the normal 20 minutes that I give most movies (13th Warrior, for example) and then turn it off. But instead, this is a movie I will recommend to friends as a companion to Braveheart and Excalibur. As for accuracy, I'm not a historian. But if you want a grand scale motion picture that looks like you've jumped back in time then MESSENGER does not disappoint. 4 1/2 out of 5 stars. Not 5 because the accents don't seem quite right. NOTE: I recorded a copy off the pay channels but plan to pick up the DVD for the widescreen treatment."
1,Horrible.,"Joan was not crazy, was not a schizophrenic, and did not look like that. This movie tarnishes her memory. If I had lightening bolts, I would strike down the crew and actors of this movie, who BLATANTLY decided to throw away pure fact and focus instead on ""Can we make a lot of money of this instead of telling the truth?? CAN WE??!!"" Disagree? ...I am very vehement about this subject and would be glad to prove you wrong...I mean...talk with you about this."
5,Great Overview of Talent,"This CD illustrates Arturo's extraordinary trumpet playing ability while providing even listeners who only moderatly like jazz great songs such as Maria and My Way. If you are a fan of jazz, his songs and especially the classic A Night in Tunisia will fulfill your desires. All songs showcase Sandoval's diversity and ability. If your a trumpet player, you will be impressed and astonished, but this CD will be enjoyable to all who appreciate and enjoy music."
4,Very Good,"This cd is very good, it has a very good production. It is not too country like her other albuns and not too pop like breathe. The Best songs are the Dianne Warren penned ""Just To Hear You Say That You Love Me"" and the up tempo ""The Hard Way"". The ballad ""I Love You"" is perfect in her voice."
2,"Weak as an album, with some standouts","Bought this for ""This Kiss"", which is easily an ""A"" song.Also enjoyed ""The Secret of Life"", which is a solid ""B""However, beyond these two for me, there is not much going on. Lots of ""C"" )average) and ""D"" (below average) songs on this album.I generally like Faith Hill, but I was expecting a little more consistency given the high reviews on Amazon.As an Album, I give it a ""D"". Barely passing, but well below average. It is too bad, because Faith is very talented artist."
4,Surprisingly Good,"Faith Hill has never disappointed me with any of her albums. Though not as good as her latest effort Cry, it is much better than her most popular album, Breathe. This CD has her most notable hits of the late '90s - This Kiss, Let Me Let Go, The Secret Of Life and Just To Hear You Say That You Love Me, a duet with her hubby Tim McGraw. One of my favorites is Love Ain't Like That but, unfortunately, it failed at radio back in early '99. And unlike most country albums of the '90s, the unreleased songs aren't filler. In fact, my very faves are Better Days, My Wild Frontier and I Love You - all unreleased songs. Surprisingly, Faith's version of I Love You is much better than the original Celine Dion version. After Cry and It Matters To Me, Faith is my favorite album by the beautiful and talented Faith Hill."
3,Okay CD!,"This CD has only one good song and that is ""This Kiss"". I would only reccomend this CD to people who really like the song This Kiss!"
4,I love this woman !,A good CD. There're four or five songs that are hi - quality. Country music is lucky to have her . I recommend it to ya all !!! Faith still have a lot of things to say in music.
5,Increbile.... The Best Country Album Of 1998,"After a three year hiatus, Faith Hill returned to the musical elite by releasing her third LP in the spring of '98. The album has the qualities of a traditional country album...but with such a rock/pop edge that it sold an excess of 5 million copies. It produced five hit singles. And that doesn't even begin to cover the true greatness of this album. Such unreleased tracks like ""You Give Me Love"", ""I Love You"", & ""The Hard Way"" all have a great mainstream quality that makes them infectuous. But the standout track comes at the end. The Sheryl Crow-written ""Stand By Me"" becomes the 6-minute epic on the album. Faith Hill has never put (and maybe never will again) so much emotion into each track as she has on Faith. This is one of the few country albums made that you can hit ""play"" and listen to it the entire way through, and at the end you feel that you've gained something from listening to it. That's how you know an album is truly great."
3,"Have ""Faith""","In all fairness, I had to give this CD three stars in reviewing its overall content, style and originality. That is, once I was able to get past the track titled, ""This Kiss"". It's the best song on the CD, even with it's ""Pretender's/Shawn Colvin"" influences ringing here and there throughout. It's one of those records that has such great energy, you can't help but feel good. There are some very unique vocal tracks on this CD and Faith Hill's ability to be versitile should not be overlooked. It isn't ""Deep"", but if you just want to kick back and have fun, this is the one."
2,A big disappointment - nothing new here.,"I was very disappointed after listening to Faith Hill's new album ""Faith."" With the exception of the single ""This Kiss,"" which was what made me want to hear the rest of the album, all the songs sounded pretty much alike. How sad that all Nashville studios seem to turn out in their female artists are cloned, generic pop-like slush. I couldn't tell the difference between Faith and any other female singer on the radio with this album. An overall disappointment in song choices and performance. Too bad, because I really wanted to like it."
4,Perfect Size,"Yes, this is an official Nintendo case. It is cute and just the perfect size for the discs. It has a nice rubber Nintendo logo at the front. Small & very portable, you can slip it into your pocket. My complain about this product is that the sleeves inside is not sturdy enough. 3 of the sleeves are now ripped."
3,pretty average,"as far as autobio's go. i guess i could attribute that to its being written by a conservative, old fashioned man with no particular opinions i can remember about anything important. boxers may enjoy it but its not something everyone would be interested in, i don't think."
4,"Good, but not as good as some of their other music","There are some very good songs here. What I think is missing is the power of the their other albums. This is more on the pop side of things. I will say the music is very catchy and put together pretty well. It's a very good album for what it is, I just don't like it as much as the other stuff. I guess I like louder kind of music better in general."
1,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"i am a saggy old man in tights...i am about 95 years old and still wrestling..if you call it wrestling...i was in my prime back in 1970, now i just come out to the ring and enjoy the spotlight with batista...dave batista that is...the most dominating man in all of sports entertainment...batista should really be in the picture also becuase they are tag team partners..and batista does all the work and ric flairs does jack""im the jet flying, saggy backin, boat drivin, not high flyin...wooooo old man...great picture to have up in a manly room like the basement...i personally use my flair picture to toss darts at...the bullzeye is if you hit that fat cow numbered number 55 in the background..."
4,Ayn Rand Jitterbugs With Chairman Mao,"As always, Clavell puts together a wonderful labyrinth of subplots that keep this capitalist/communist/opportunist thriller moving all 1370 pages. If you loved Tai-Pan, you'll enjoy Noble House. Clavell was fond of Ayn Rand's philosophy, so it was interesting to see him portray those ideals through some of the characters--curious how laissez-faire would sometimes need to hold hands with the bamboo/iron curtain."
3,Not as good as Shogun or Tai-pan,"As good as James Clavell is, this book was rather disappointing for me. Don't get me wrong, it's good - however not comparable to Shogun or Tai-pan.It's rather similar to Tai-pan but in a different era. There's also way more pseudo-political subplots interwoven into the story, for those who like that type of thing. For me, I thought it was a bit too much. I wish it focused a bit more on Ian Dunross the main character.For those new to James Clavell, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SHOGUN. His magnum opus! It is the best book I have ever read. You will not regret it."
3,Slow moving,"I was pretty excited when I came across Le Fanu's book as I had read somewhere that he was one of the originators of gothic literature. Perhaps I am not used to the pace of Victorian novels, but Le Fanu's book was too draggy for me. I am not even sure it was very suspenseful at all. Too many minor characters also spolit the book for me -- was Captain Oakley only in the novel to show off the naivety of Maud? The mystery of Uncle Silas wasn't very engaging and I was just dying to get to the end of the novel just so I could move on to other things. The ending of the book is also predictable, and Uncle Silas basically lived up to his horrible reputation."
1,wrong vol,ordered vol 2 got vol one if they didnt know the difference the should have sayed it was that they had a lot of vol ones and were really trying to get rid of them and had only one vol 2
1,Terrible book.,To me this story is baloney to begin with but if you believe in miracles you may enjoy it.
1,Picks Noise from Everything,"I have three CB radios: Honda JC-216H for my motorcycle ($600.- and it's the reason that I start with CB), Midland 75-822 ($85), and this Cobra 18 WX ST II ($64). My ratings to these three CB are: Cobra 1 star, Midland and Honda 5 stars.The 18WX is very bad compare with 75-822 about noise filtering. I installed them two in the same SUV with identical antennas (Cobra HGA-1500), the 18WX picks noise from every thing: engine, fuel pump, folding motor of mirror, air conditioner, horn and even horn of those cars beside you. The 75-822 just pick nothing but a little the folding motor. It's totally terrible when you use it while driving."
4,perfect fit,"This sleeve fits the Apple MacBook Pro 15.4 inch perfectly, and it has fabric that protects the zipper from scratching your computer. This extra fabric does add a little extra room around your computer, but it's barely noticible (not like the InCase I had originally bought, which had about 3 inches of extra space!). Only reason I give it 4 stars is that it didn't come with the cord pouch like the other ones do, I think you have to buy that separately maybe. Other than that, it's the best sleeve I've found, and for someone that has tons of other bags but just needs extra protection for your laptop, this is the way to go."
4,These Guys COULD be GREAT!,"It is sad to think about how awesome these guys could really be if they tried. Their music is great and the song craftsmanship is excellent. But, it all gets ruined at the end of every song with this very stupid sounding distorted scream that simply discounts the whole listening experience. If they would keep that out of it, they songs would be much more listenable and would withstand the test of time."
3,The ever changing Pillar,"You know these guys use to be in a nu metal scene? Little rap, little rock.Well that got old and they moved on [like thousand foot krutch] and made another album which hinted some raplikeock in Fireproof. but with their ""where do we go from here"" they entered a striaght up rock album that rocked.[like thousand foot krutch]Now they seemed to have changed again, Trying to get into some of that screamo stuff eh? well...it doesn't work. They don't have any athem like songs.Now it does have some good songs, but I was expecting better.I give it two stars cuz I'm a harsh person and wouldn't want to mislead anyone into thinking its a great cd. Buy it and expectt a couple good songs."
5,Stuart Little,I ordered this movie for my son's birthday. He was too young when this series came out. He is starting to enjoy movies that aren't always animated. Lovely story. Recieved this DVD on time and brand new. I will continue to shop at Amazon
4,For all ages!,"For the young this DVD is very entertaining because of a very nice film and wonderful DVD extras. For Adults, the film is very well done, amazing animation that can't help you but live the events of the film with all its laughter and tears.If you are looking for a light entertaining commedy, this I'd recommend... especially that it's very rare now-a-days to find good commedy films. My only dislike is that the movie is a bit long that gets boring in the middle but this doesn't affect your acceptance of the film."
2,WHAT A MISTAKE!,"DELUXE EDITION? FOR WHO? RELEASING THIS FILM AGAIN BUT NOT MAKING IT A WIDESCREEN RATIO IS A BIG MISTAKE. IF THEIR AIM IS TO PLEASE CHILDREN, I HAVE NEWS FOR THEM. KIDS DON'T EVEN NOTICE THE BLACK BARS WHEN THEY ARE WATCHING WIDESCREEN MOVIES. PARENTS BUY THE MOVIES AND ENJOY THEM ALONG WITH THEIR CHILDREN, EITHER OFFER THE MOVIES WITH BOTH WIDESCREEN AND FULL FRAME VERSIONS AVAILABLE OR SUFFER LOW SALES BECAUSE OF SHORT SIGHTED SALES BLUNDERS."
5,Animals steal the show,"There are few kids movies I can sit through more than once--this one I've already seen 7 times! My son is now over 3 and he can load the DVD player himself and turn on the TV. Guess what gets put on now?! I must say that I love that the movie doesn't patronize my son. There are heavy issues here: fear of being alone; fear of violence; fear of failure--but the characters aren't obsessed or broken by their fears, they confront them and work through them. For example, when Stuart is trying to make friends with the family pet cat Snowball, Stuart says rather naively, ""Can't we just be friends? Do you want me to scratch your ear? Can I pat your tummy?"" to which Snowball answers, ""How'd you like to pat it from the inside mouse-boy!?"" Direct, without wishy-washy handwringing, or moralizing. My son says that he ""loves Stuart."" I too love Stuart."
1,erroneous message,"I found this movie to portay the adoptive process erroneously. I'm very glad that I previewed this movie before allowing my children to view it. The movie makes a mockery of the adoptive process and the committment and legal finality of the process. The writers could have stayed true to the origional story by e.b. white and still made a truely wonderful and fantesy filled movie. But instead the movies ignites every fear an adoptive child has about being taken away. The movie should carry a warning about its content, like ""This movie makes a mockery of adoption."" Or ""This movie will terrify adopted kids."""
4,this movie is ok,"Stuart Li5ttle is a sad movie here, he is alone in the world untill he finds a friend. It has some humor with the cats and Stuart does some himself."
3,ok,It was a ok film. It started out really boring and it dint get better till almos the end of the film. It was funny but not as funny as I thought it was going to be. But it is a ok film it is more for little kids thow.
4,"Add a ""Little"" Stuart to Your Life","What a wonderful ""little"" movie about adoption, love, friendship, and loyalty. Fun for all ages. Michael J. Fox and Nathan Lane's voice-over work is top rate. Let Stuart come into your heart and home. You'll be glad you did."
4,Adoption message,"This is a fun, wholesome movie. It also provides a starting point for discussing adoption with children. Even if children aren't adopted, they will certainly meet others who are. This movie presents adoption in a positive light, an attitude which I believe even young children can begin to emulate."
1,Where's the book?!!!??,"I have a couple of reasons why this is bad:1. Loads of language such as ""Lets rep his head off"".2.Nathan lane and Steve Zahn are the only funneies in the movie.3.Mild peril for PG.4. They talk about Wine and Beer. Note: Its a innuando.5. Wheres the part where when he falls in love with the 2 1/2inch girl? The screenwriter must have been pretty stupid to leave that out.6.There's a picture of death off camera wich is very harshly taken.7. They talk about killers.8. This is not for adoption children.9. This is half false advirtisment, bechause the charecters from the book reaturn, but its not the book.This is probably the worst movie of 1999. So please, save your money, save your blockbuster movie pass, even save your library card, this is a horriable movie. FALSE ADVERTISMENTS!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Previous Yellowstone Visitors,"If you have been to Yellowstone for a few days, you will love this book!"
2,A dissapointing book,"This book seemed so interesting on the shelf...but it wasn't. Instead of telling good stories - the author just chronicles the ""stupid"" deaths in Yellowstone National Park over the years. Yes, some of these are truly astonishing, but most of them are rather unremarkable.Whittlesey loses his way and the book becomes merely a listing of the deaths. It is so exhaustive that he fails to ever go anywhere with his material.If you are looking for a comprehensive listing of foolhardy deaths in a National Park with no overarching narrative, that reads like a dictionary at times, then you've found it. Enjoy."
2,Great phone - unless you are outside or in the car,"I only needed a basic phone - no MP3, camera, or FM radio. This phone delivered with great reception, good sound quality, great battery life, and a very small size. Inside a building it works great. Why the low score? The tinted plastic over the display makes it impossible to see the display outdoors and in the car. If the sun is out, forget it! I even managed to figure out how to remove all of the wallpaper backgrounds and to maximize the contrast. Still, don't plan to use this outdoors. Nokia should recall this product to replace the tinted cover. Update: Yesterday this phone took was accidently dropped onto a very hard ceramic tile floor and it still works perfectly! A similar drop ended the life of my digital camera a few months ago. So, if I were to rate this cell phone now I would give it 3 stars, maybe even 4 stars. I like reliable, sturdy stuff and this cell seems to be unusually well made."
1,George b,"I see this highly rated and don't understand how that can be, unless screen visibility is of no concern to those reviewers. Look before you buy this one!I'd never recommend this 2610 because of the single issue that the display is unusable in daylight & barely marginal for inside viewing. It's a shame because the sound is good. Maybe that's why AT&T; gives them away free - hoping to get rid of them."
3,Waste of time for Contract renewal,"You can buy this ""Go Phone"" for $20 to $30 in most local stores and simply stick your sim card in it. There is no reason to renew your contract to get this very simple phone. Walk into a Walmart, and pick it up with no new contract required."
2,Poorly written,The paragraphs in between and explaining the works were pedantic and had several errors. I would recommend simply finding all the the individual works from free sources. They are published free on the internet and available from libraries.
3,Not rocket science but helps reinforce good habits,"I bought one each for two family members, daughter and brother, with the hope this book would help their 'focus'. Each is in a fast paced, time consuming job which leaves precious little personal time. This book could help, but as you may have guessed, neither has read the book even though I gave it to each one 5 months ago. ""You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink""."
3,So what?,"The title is the answer to what a woman say after she's transported to the future and finds out she is sterile from the transfer process; she says (as best I can remember after 30 years), ""But that will mean the end of the human race!""I have quoted that line every since; I can't begin to count the number of times. There were 10 people in the theatre, and it was the 3rd day after opening; no one I know has seen it except for the 9 other people I went with. However, like ""A Boy and His Dog"", it's a film you will never forget.The ending is also something I've talked about for 30 years; it'll be nice to be able to show this to the many people I've told about it. (I think it should have been a Craftsman screwdriver, and not a Great Neck.)"
3,Would give it 3.5 stars if I could,"I used this for my Computer Science I text at North Dakota State. It gives a solid intro to COMPUTING CONCEPTS, hence the title. It makes no attempt to teach every detail about Java, but if you have a good professor they'll let you know about the Java API documentation, from where you can explore everything about it. The book is riddled with errors, but Horstmann lists them on his web site and has made and effort to correct them in subsequent printings. The first chapter on applets (Ch 4) is horrible, though, and that really drags down my view of the book. It gives people a bad feeling early on and drives some people away. Also, arrays/vectors should be covered earlier because they would make some things a lot easier to do."
2,Don't Let This Book Confuse You,"Interestingly, I attend San Jose State University, and the author of this book is a profesor at this university.To establish my credibility, I'm quite an experienced programmer. I've taken quite a few programming classes and have never received anything less than an A.But I've never touched Java before, and this book totally confuses me. It keeps referencing back and forth different classes/methods with similiar names, and in the end I'm completely lost.Even at the beginning of this book, it discusses some concepts that just wouldn't make sense at all to a beginner. I'm glad this is not my first programming book, or I wouldn't have any idea what the first chapter is all about.Too bad for me, this is required for my Java course, so I'm stuck with it. If you're not required to own this book, AVOID IT."
4,This isn't a bad book,"This is a very good book to use as a teaching tool in a classroom, but unfortunately unless you are very aware of what you are typing and have a good understanding of the language this may become troublesome because of typos in the code. If you are trying to learn on your own this is an easy book to work with, just make sure you know of some one you can go to with questions."
1,run if your teachers uses this book,"i put alot of time and effort reading all these chapters and it just did not payoff. This book is horrible if your a novice in java, DO NOT START WITH THIS BOOK. If you dont have a teacher to help you, really run fast!! This book gives examples of exercises and gives you all the terms and building blocks, but it just doesnt help. Find another book is my best advice."
2,AVOID IT,"I'm not suprised so many schools use this book to teach introduction to computer programming. Why? Because like all educational textbooks, they're boring and usually confusing.This book certainly has those characteristics. Virtually everything about the text is bad - from its organization to elucidation of concepts.Even if your school uses it, just buy another Java textbook. IT ...! IT IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY."
4,A Good introduction to programming & Java,"I found this book pretty neat if one wants to develop an object oriented approach to programming .Though java is not covered exhaustively, but it does give the beginner a feel of how java works.I had a teacher to go along with this book & that too helped to get the maximum from the book"
3,"Love the Show, but the new Theme bites!","My favorite sitcom of all time, but this anemic replacement theme song really puts a damper on collecting the series. For me, it's all about having the complete, original show - theme included....an NO, I'm not going to play the CD theme song before every episode. I'd gladly pay a little extra to get the real thing. IMHO."
5,Perfect,The package was in great condition! 100%!I got this as a gift for my dad and he is Enjoying every minute of this hilarious TV show!
3,3rd season DVDs and we still bad video quality,"They finally released the famous and some say the best season of MWC (after nearly a year of delays, thanks to the struggle over theme music rights), and Sony still hasn't done a thing about the video quality. It's still pretty bad, even when compared to much older TV shows on DVD. I think I read somewhere that Sony figured buyers of these sets would be low class anyway, and wouldn't care about quality as much. So they are still compressing to much data on only 3 discs. Business is business, I suppose. I would have preferred clean crisp video (c'mon, even Doctor Who looks better than this), but it looks as if this trend of bad video quality is going to continue. Anyway, great show, one of the most famous and funniest of the seasons of MWC. Worth the price? Ehhh... If you're a true hardcore fan, you have to get it. There's no alternative.1 star for video quality.5 stars for the show itself.3 stars for an overall."
4,Married .....without the theme song.........,"0 stars for Sony's unforgivable mangling of an ""uncut"" original.An almost typical release from Sony's TV Series of DVD's and as a fan of Married I can't resist even though its put out with the minimum of effort, but they have managed a new low this time -- they've REPLACED the classic theme song with A THIRD RATE DIRIVITIVE PEICE OF SYNTHO-GARBAGE! Apparently reliscening was just too much money. What's next MASH with a reggae beat? Imagine Hill Street Blues , Dragnet, 5-0, Cosby, etc. etc stripped of their iconic theme songs and replaced with a tone-deaf monkey's attempt at music. Its a struggle listen through the credits in fact, its a struggle to even want to watch the episode after listening to the garbage - I suggest everyone start exercising their ""fast forward"" fingers!"
5,One of mom's first acting gigs,"This show was one of the first that my mother, Marilyn Pitzer, appeared on. She is in two episodes of this season; only one with lines however. Life's a Beach. The cast and crew of MWC were all terrific and it was a thrill for my grandmother to see her daughter on the set of a television show with her own dressing room. Marilyn went on to appear in Growing Pains (The Recruiter), It Runs In the Family, commercials and tv specials. And a couple of cult movies, including The Willies."
2,Could have been better,"I bought this book for the unique spreads and read it thoroughly. I would have liked to see explanations for why the cards are laid out in certain order and places. I thought the questions were too specific and would be difficult to answer with numerous cards. Interesting spreads, good subject matter, not well executed or explained at all. Please rewrite the book, Ms. Abraham and I will buy it again."
5,Excellent steamer,"Slowly but surely I am changing to healthier eating habits and this steamer is a big help. Not only is it a beautiful piece to hang in my kitchen, but its generous size allows me to steam a good quantity of vegetables or fish. I use it atop the CIA saucier - a great combo. Highly recommend."
3,Not the S.A.M.E. as you might think,"I am a part of SKYWARN for the NWS, so I thought this radio would be perfect for me. I had to wait for 2 months to get one (via Amazon). I tried for a month to get SAME to work, but no luck. Turns out that once you decode the programing instuctions and set up the codes, SAME may not work if you are too far away from the NOAA station. While I can receive 4 of the 6 NOAA stations, none of them are strong enough to trigger the SAME. Based on feedback from others, I would pick a different radio if you have a real need for SAME."
2,Old Model Weather Radio,"There are newer models for portable weather radios that fix some of the problems in the reviews listed here, including the WR113 that includes a charging dock, and the WR601 that has non-volatile memory and a dock, so you don't have to input your SAME codes after the battery runs out."
4,Great value,"Great value - very useful in the middle of the night when you want to find out quickly whether the thunderstorm that's going on around you, is really something to worry about ... Should come with an AC power supply though."
3,Less Than Expected,"I bought the Oregon Scientific WR102 to supplement an older weather alert clock radio that did not have the SAME feature. I never could get it to work right. I set it according to the instructions and missed alerts that my other older radio picked up. My wife took the WR102 to work and tried to get it to work there and got the same results; it would not pick up local NOAA alerts. It would pick up the local NOAA station when the NOAA button was pressed.I bought the Oregon Scientific WR103NX to replace my WR102 and it works fine. I have had no problem with it and both radios are programmed in exactly the same way. Maybe I just got a bad radio. It happens. My suggestion is to pay a little more for the WR103NX (which comes with a docking stand, alkaline batteries, DC converter and a ""non-volatile"" memory that preserves your settings if the batteries die)."
1,It sucks!,"What is this? The whole idea with DVD sucks with this title! The picture and sound quality is worse than a heavily used standard 8 mm film!The movie ...and of course Dorothy Lamour, is worth something better than this. Take it out of your stock and replace it with an appropriate copy.No recommendations what so ever!"
1,DVD quality lacks..,"This DVD-production [is bad]! The movie itself is a real good one with beautifully acting performances. Although the dvd-edition do not cost a fortune, it's more like a lousy super-8 after running threw the projector one million times! I'm truly disappointed. The movie is worth much better treatment."
1,"Only wish there was ""Zero Stars"" rating","Wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing this wretched ""dvd"". Beyond pathetic. It's like watching something found in an abandoned theater's basement. It actually hurts to watch a great movie being butchered by this production company.Just saw it on Turner Classic Movies - tape it in SP mode and make it a part of your permanent collection. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DVD!"
2,This is not Pratchett,"This is a strange book, quite good, but it reads like well-informed fan fiction, not at all like Terry Pratchett himself (i have read all of the Discworld series, some titles several times over).The style is dry, the characters non-developed, the pacing and structure do not have the same feel as other works, and it lots of ways this story is flavorless.It doesn't feel right...."
3,missing Nigel Planer,"The story here is a nice addition to the Discworld series, and Vimes is a great character, though I felt Carcer was underdeveloped and a bit one-dimensional -- would have been interesting to get more background on him. My three stars are for the readers on the Book-on-tape. They all do a good job, but I desperately miss Nigel Planer as narrator and hope he will be back for future Discworld titles. Hearing Vimes and company in someone else's voice(s) just seems *wrong*, Planer is such a talented reader and has such a tremendous range, I just couldn't get used to hearing anyone else. Please bring him back!"
4,A must for all gifted educators,"This book addresses the differences between gifted students who are wealthy, middle class and poor and how they interact with their world. It further helps educators to meet the challenges of identifying gifted students of poverty through interviews, inventories and guidelines. While putting all the templates to use for every possible gifted child would be daunting, if not impossible, a gifted educator would be remiss in not using them for highly verbal or creative students of poverty. The book is well worth it for the teacher inventory alone."
1,Poverty Does Not Isolate You From Giftedness,"The argument that growing up in poverty causes one to be overlooked with regard to giftedness doesn't fly with me. The author lays it on pretty thick about how poverty negatively affects how teachers view giftedness in their students. There was little in this book I found noteworthy when read with common sense as my guide. Our American educational system needs a serious overhaul and the focus on ""feeling good"" simply because you're in the classroom needs to go by the wayside. Poor or rich, all students are capable of giftedness. They just need to apply themselves and make the necessary effort to achieve success."
2,MONIQUE'S PERFORMANCE LACKLUSTER; THE PRISONERS ARE THE REAL STARS HERE,"A couple of reasons why I didn't like this project:a) Monique tends to tell the same jokes in all of her routines. These women have been locked up for many years, many are never getting out. I thought that they (and those who support Monique) deserved a better show.b) Too much profanity. She is already a funny lady. Lazy people, however, lean on profanity when creativity is lacking (see above). I know for a fact that she could have done better. She isn't a lazy woman by any means, but it is painfully evident that she wasn't motivated here.What I loved about this project, however, was the interviews she had with some of the inmates, and that rousing encore song by one of the female prisoners at the end. She had everyone crying (including me!). I hope that Monique kept her promise to that young lady long after the cameras stopped rolling. For these reasons alone, I gave two stars."
3,She got them laugh!,"She may cussed and is nasty , I dont like it . But I don't look at that for a factor. I was looking at how she treats cellmates to keep them laughing and let them know they can STILL do anything they dream of. It is touched. I know she has nice side even thru she cuss, ppl just don't see it. They are too busy judging her. She told them to not come back! That what got me smile and she almost cried when a girl hitted note about she is not worrying about tomorrow because she still have God in life. WOW (applaude) ...."
5,Great value!,My mother loves Red Door so I got her this set for Mother's Day. She loves it and it was a great deal!
1,Great value for the money,"This product was purchased as a gift, and it was definitely a value for the money."
3,Choral version,"This CD has nothing to do with the sounddtrack. It is an arrangement by Rózsa based on his music for Ben-Hur and King of Kings, specially for choral performance and sung here with organ accompanient. The 12 choral pieces which include a new one especially composed by Rózsa had a sheetmusic issue at the time but which is now sadly out of print. The performance here is OK but rather uninspired. They need rerecording with modern technology and an enthousiastic choir."
5,Chiefs TVmini-series review,I have been looking for this TV mini-series for a while. Saw it back in the 80's.......very suspenseful!!! Wish I could buy the dvd with the full series. Kathy
1,Chiefs,This movie was ordered on 9 Sep 12 and it is now 26 Oct 12...I have yet to receive it. So for that reason I'm unable to give any type of rating.
1,Very poor sound quality,"I was very disappointed with this product, the sound quality made the movie unwatchable. Perhaps the German soundtrack is better?"
5,Mini Series from the past,"I remember watching this mini-series when it came on T.V. and was glad I was able to find it again. Chiefs was written by Stuart Woods and I have read all his books, prefer the Capitol series that follow the folks from the mimi-series,a fantastic show."
1,Trash it,"This has to be the worst book Twain has every written. I had to do a book report on a book that was dull, stupid and lackluster. I love sifi and fanstay book but this is the worst I have ever read in 30 years"
5,Amusing History and Memoir,"Every time I look at a river, I think of Mark Twain and his adventures on the Mississippi. His writing, always funny and warm, tells us first of the history and stories of his beloved river, and then of his experiences learning the steamboat trade. I found his description of being a steamboat student very similar to being a medical student: two-hundred years later and in completely different trades, route memorization and gradual responsibility for people's lives still have much in common. This book made me want to travel the Mississippi, not as it stands today but as it appeared to Twain in his youth. I feel the same way about Gabriel Garcia Marquez and his Magdalena river. I think it is amazing how these inspired authors can make me love a river I have never seen."
3,Hard To Get Into,"I remembered reading this a teen and wanted it for my Kindle, especially since it was a freebie. But this time around I found the book very hard to even get into. Maybe it's age, but I didn't enjoy the book and ended up deleting it from my Kindle."
2,weird & funky,"i have one of the originals of this book and it's so old and crusty and it was so weird and hard to understand with all those big words, and different from the new copies made of it. The only reason to read it would be for school."
2,"I didn't really like the book it was boring, the end=best.",It was grat at some parts and boring at others. The end made up for alot of the book.
1,I only gave it a 1 'cause there isn't a lower Rating!,"Hi everyone! I had to read this book for school and it was torture. I would not ever reccommend this book to anyone. It was soo boring! Mark Twain tried to be funny, but he was not! The chapters droned on and on about boring topics. This is not a lie at all: I fell asleep with the book open on my lap!"
3,very cynical book,A very cynical and satirical look at life in the middle ages. It starts out rather cheerful and relaxed but it turns mean spirited towards the end. I didn't like the way the tone changed. Interesting but not as good as Twain's other well known works. Still it is worthwhile reading for any Twain fan.
5,an excellent choice,"It is not Twain's best book, and certainly not the same as something like Huckleberry Finn, however this is highly recommended reading. The satire is excellent, and although some people who may be a little too serious about Arthurian legends may not appreciate it, I certainly did. Based on this book I would guess that Mark Twain would've been the among the best, and definitely the funniest, science fiction writers of all time if he had decided to follow that path. This book is great for anyone who loves the humor of Mark Twain."
2,A blast From The Past Yea Right,A Connecticut Yankee Takes A blast from the past. Yea right! this book is extremely long and rarely has any action to keep you awake if I were a book rater I would give this book a two out of ten thumps up . this story takes place in the 6th century and the only good part was when they were going to burn Hank Morgan and to top it off they didn't even burn him because brought his knowledge from current time and fooled King Author by saying if they don't let him go he will shut down the moon but it was acuity a solar eclipse so the moon slowly faded away so they let him free. Honestly I think this book is not for kids our age it's more for adults. Because I couldn't even stay focus it was so boring I started reading other books. This book may be for determined readers but you better keep a cup of coffee near by full because you might fall asleep.
5,Another Heritage Press Release in Slipcase,"This review relates to the Heritage 1944 edition...Heritage's Life on the Mississippi features a dusky green slipcase; book is covered in textured green cloth with a riverboat emblem. Over 40 Thomas Hart Benton illustrations in color and black & white.Includes ""a number of previously suppressed passages, now printed for the first time and edited with a note from Willis Wager.""418 pp, decorated cloth over hardback boards, sewn binding."
4,A Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes,"Among the many works of Tibetan masters devoted to the three codes, none has enjoyed more notoriety than A Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes by the celebrated author Saskya Pandita Kunga Gyaltshen (or Sapan, 1182-1251), presented here in a Western translation for the first time. Not so much a text on the content of the codes themselves as an examination of the many particular questions that relate to the codes - questions that Sapan saw as subject to misunderstanding on the part of his Tibetan contemporaries - The Three Codes has a strongly polemical character. Thus it is easy to see why some readers found the work objectionable in places, others praised it, and all have become fascinated by it. Few indigenous Tibetan writings have inspired so abundant and diverse a body of later-commentary, commentary that rivals even that on the great Indian Buddhust treatises in its extent."
5,Excellent social history,"To gain even a little understanding of the social, cultural and political elements that were bubbling in the period just before the First World War, I don't think 1913: THE DEFIANT SWAN SONG (a/k/a 1913: An End and A Beginning in its US edition) has been bettered.Despite the age of this book (published originally in 1967), it stands up very well as an introduction to this era, particularly when compared to certain recent books about this time period. For example, Juliet Nicolson's The Perfect Summer: England 1911, Just Before the Storm, was a disappointment, both in its somewhat hyperbolic execution and as an error-free social history.But Ms. Cowles was a seasoned historian, as well as an edifying writer. This book's brevity is its only fault. The reader is left wanting even more."
4,Nephew LOVES these!,Nephew loves it. Wont stop watching them daily! I will be buying more in the future for him! Little boys love Little Einsteins!
2,broken,We purchased this at Babies R Us and one of the episodes didn't work. Of course we couldn't return it because it had been opened and used. It must have been a defective disc. We were disappointed to only get two episodes out of it.
2,Misleading Description on DVD & Disney Site,"Don't be misled by the DVD description or the description on the Disney website.This is NOT a movie!This is 3 separate episodes that have been shown on TV over and over:The Treasure Behind The Little Red Door, Super Fast, and The Great Sky Race RematchThe descriptions do not tell you this, they lead you to believe it's one long episode/movie...my kids were sooo excited! BIG disappointment because they'd seen all the episodes so many times on TV...nothing new at all.These DVD ""movies"" are actually episode collections - don't be misled!"
1,False Advertising,"Race for Space has *nothing* to do with outer space, even though tv advertsiements. literature and the back of the dvd state there is a new space episode, there is not. None of the episodes have anything to do with outer space. Rip off, avoid."
1,Our Big no Huge Disappointment,"There is nothing associated with outer space. My son loves the Einsteins and he loves space. So when I saw this I assumed that they would have an episode associated to outer space. No just the brief chase of the last little piggy. Something tells me that Disney knows what they did and are just trying to get more money. Unfortunately, our kids pay the price because like the other reviewers our son was so excited and then angry because he didn't get the race for space show. Shame on Disney!"
2,its ok,"this book is just ok,the art of stealth is much more than illustrated in this book. as an expert in the art of ninjutsu stealth, i can tell you,you cannot expect to show the true aspects of stealth and clandestine movement by not showing methods of silent walking, proper hiding and camouflauge, and so on so forth. it explains a few helpful tips, some of which really are just plain common sense to be honest. maybe i might recommend it to someone now beginning in stealth training...MAYBE. i actually rather recommend getting stephen hayes' book ""the mystic arts of the ninja"". it shows a few ways of walking as well camouflauge and escape"
5,toshiba sd3750,"Great replacement for a Panasonic DVD-31 that died only 7 months into the purchase (and out of labor warranty of course....grrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!) I like most of the features except the remote which seems to be a problem with Toshiba dvd players regardless. Anyways very happy, no problems during playback, zoom, etc. MP3 quality on CD-R media is excellent, never used MP3 on CD-RW. Great sound quality using the Yamaha Amp. Also great for the future for the progressive scan output. Forget Panasonic, they don't have zoom feature. Menu selection a little slow to change screens but good layout otherwise."
5,All you need.,Mr. Steves pulls off another winner book. It is all you need if you do not speak french.
5,Full of Surprises,"An intelligent and useful phrase book but full of surprises. You have to read the whole thing--how to handle yourself in a bar (Viva la France!!), how to tell the taxi driver that he is going so fast that you are going to throw up, and on and on. But lots of useful stuff too, including phrases that a standard guidebook wouldn't think to tell you about."
5,Buy it now!,"If you watched the DVD of this concert, then you will want to buy this. If you don't own the DVD, then what are you waiting for? If you are a Peter Gabriel fan, then this is a must have! If you aren't a fan, then this message isn't for you."
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST CD'S OF ALL TIME---FANTASTIC!!!,"NOT EVERY BODY CAN GET TO SEE PG LIVE. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE A FAN OF CLASSIC ROCK MUSIC, THE LIVE RENDITIONS ON THIS RECORDING WILL GIVE YOU GOOSE BUMPS. JUST CRANK UP THE VOLUME ON ""IN YOUR EYES"" AND YOU'LL RAISE THE HAIRS ON THE BACK OF YOUR NECK! THESE TRACKS ARE SUPERIOR TO ANY OF THE STUDIO VERSIONS - ADDING EXCITEMENT AND ANTICIPATION TO YOUR LISTENING PLEASURE. IF YOU ARE DEBATING ON WHICH PG CD TO GET, YOU AND YOUR PARTY FRIENDS WILL CERTAINLY ENJOY THIS ISSUE!!!!!."
3,in your eyes?,"the version of ""in your eyes"" is a cheap permutation of the original POV version and edits remotely available. Paula Cole is a contributor to the shame and luke-warm performance of it, however, ""secret world"" is a well done and is worth having. note that the disc has more songs on it than the video concert ""secret world."""
2,Does not get hot enough,Amazon did a great job in getting the item out to me fast. Unfortunetly the item does not perform up to standards. It doesn't get hot enough to do a proper seal. It left bubbles all over the item. I tried it a couple of time by letting the machine warm up for up to 15 minutes and still did not get a proper seal.
2,Not Much Of A Camera,"I got mine in a ""it's got to go"" sale at a local big name computer/office supply store for about $29. The directions are less-than-stellar; you're going to have to experiment. The photo quality isn't all that bad for a cheapie. Getting an updated driver from the Micro Innovations web site seems to be a chore for many buyers as there are NO drivers available as of the time of this posting. Get something good for your money."
1,Echo echo echo echo,"Wow, the sound quality on this phone is poor. The person I'm talking with sounds like they're down a well, and there is a constant echo of my own voice.I've tried a couple of different style headsets, too, and though that takes care of the echo, the volume put out the headset port is inadequate. Also, there are some intermittent clicks and pops with either headset.Sure, it looks cool, but it's a piece of junk."
2,No better than a corded phone,"Phone works fine, but signal dropouts begin when any more than 10 feet from the base. My old 47mhz cordless works better from the same location."
5,"Great bag for summer, spring and fall trips",Bought this bag a few years ago. Very warm. Lots of room to move in--I'm a heavy person who doesn't like to be closed in. Never a problem with the zippers. Love the inside print.
2,Needs to cover the basics!,"""Cracking the SAT/PSAT"" provided some really helpful vocabulary lists but the test taking strategies were non-helpful. The idea of the Joe Bloggs principle made me uncomfortable and the book focused too much on eliminating obvious answer choices and guessing instead of teaching how to solve the problems by knowing the right technique."
5,GOOD SAT PREPARATION.,This book is very good for preparation of the SAT. My daughter is really happy with the effect of the book because it provided with really actual examples and a lot of practice problems. All these all the key issue to raise scores in the SAT.
2,Only O.k.,Should of had more information regarding Bob Hopes secret life. That was the title of the book! Most of the book was about the things he did in his career. Anyone could of found that information. Few and irrelevant photos. No follow up on stories. Disappointing.
2,poor craftsmanship,"This is much smaller than expected. you get what you pay for, and is equivalent of a key chain tool."
4,Great Camera!,I love this camera....I've had it for a little over a month now and it's been nothing but good to me. The instructions were clear and the pictures even clearer!!
5,beats digital!,"Having both versions, analog and digital, the analog by far outperform the digital! Sound quality blows away the digital and you can adjust the volume as loud as you like, not limited by OSHA. Buy these now before they are fazed out!"
1,Cheaply made.,"All during the first year of use (3 hrs./wk.) the music would mysteriously cut off. The company, AO Safety, was no help-they never returned e-mails. So in frustration I pried them apart and with a multi-tester found that the switch-a cheap little pressed together thing, was bad. I'm no electronic wizard, but have taken apart and fixed many things, and I gotta tell you, these things are cheaply made and flimsy. I wish I could recommend a better brand, but I've never had any others. I guess you get what you pay for. They were so cool when yhey worked, though, and I'll probably spend more here at Amazon on a better brand."
2,"Great product initially, wear out in about 8 to 12 months.","I have purchased two of these units for use in my wood shop and they work just fine for the price. The analog tunung knob is easily changed by turning the unit off and on. Reception is good, not great in my area (urban). The only real complaint is the lifespan. In both of my units, the same problem occured, the cable between the battery case and headband failed within months of purchase. I have fixed the cable to prolong the life of both units until it simply got too short to solder. In the case of the last pair that died, a cable became crossed and it nearly melted while I was wearing them. I would advise purchasing a different manufacturer, as I will this time."
3,Not very satisfying or rigorous,"A key thing about this book: it's basically typed up lecture notes. Especially as it gets further along, it displays a notable lack of rigour. Some of the problems are not necessarily provable using information from the book. Furthermore, theorems don't clearly state the assumptions under which they operate. In chapter 5, the author resorts to basically presenting a laundry list of facts about differential forms on manifolds, so it's hard to get much beyond a basic idea of what's going on.I believe this book may be good for a course where the instructor can answer student's questions about ideas that aren't addressed rigorously. For self-study, it could be, at best, a supplement to another book. I'm actually a little baffled about why it seems to be so well-reviewed."
1,A device that does not work,"This product is NOT recommended. I was unable to successfully load the drivers and hardware and thus was never able to use the device. The instructions are clear but they do not work. Waste of money. Unfortunately, your choices at present are to buy more than one reader if you have multiple media types...or await a 6 in 1 type device that actually works."
4,Just a T.V. Star?,"Conventional wisdom has it that two of the Monkees--Mike Nesmith and Peter Tork--were musicians and the other two--David Jones and Micky Dolenz--were actors who had to learn to fake playing instruments. These pre-fame recordings of Micky Dolenz show that he was a reasonable rock guitarist and, low and behold, a songwriter. And, this was before there was a Monkees television show. Some of Dolenz's singing is not up to the standard he set on ""I'm a Believer"" and several other notable Monkees tracks, and some of his compositions are not the most distinctive rock or pop of the mid-1960s, and maybe he didn't know how to play the drums when the Monkees cast was assembled, but Plastic Symphony proves that Micky Dolenz really did have a pop music background before the Monkees. Would he have been a commercially successful musician had he never been cast for the show? This EP doesn't really answer that question, but he might have had a chance..."
3,Good book,"I bought this book used and it had pen writing all over the front cover and writing inside of it. When buying it did not mention this information, had I know I would have not purchased it."
5,Horton the Hero,"Horton never gives up, this is a classic book of perseverance and doing the right thing at all costs. Brilliant and well-written for the reader of all ages!"
1,thank you,This one gift I could give my grown daughter. I read this book over and over to her as a child. It was in wonderful condition!
2,Coin Collector Forgettable Book,"I have never used this book. I found the Red Book and Blue Book easier to follow, and organized more like my brain."
4,Coin grading book,Coin grading is done by strict standards. Value is set by the grade of the coin. This book helps approximate the grade of your coins.
4,Kids love it!,"Sanding and painting and putting wheels on. Especially good for the mechanically inclined (we have a girl and a boy that both are makers and tinkerers. The quality was good. I'd hoped they were a bit larger, but they are ok as is."
2,not as advertised,"These blankets are not ""gray"". They are a multi colored mish mash of wool fibers. Probably useful as an emergencty blanket but not an attractive looking item."
1,horrible quality,"I would barely call this ""woven"" wool cloth. It is almost like they just took wool and pressed it together to hold temporarily.They constantly give off fibers. Use these and every week every corner of your bedroom will be full of ""dust bunnies"" made of bundles of fibers from this blanket that just come off.And overall, if compared to any type of blanket that you would normally get for home use (even a cheap one from Walmart or Target) this is junk. It is rough, cut ugly, ugly looking, cheap looking blanket that I would only consider giving to homeless people (except considering that it is $26 and you could do much better for that price).I know that this is not a home product, but a military surplus product. But that doesn't change the garbage quality of it. It is almost like a piece of artificial foam. I can rip it with my bare hands with very little effort.Definitely don't even consider this if you got dust allergies."
4,I've gotten my money's worth,"I first purchased this as a gift for someone else, then bought one for myself. I use this as the DVD player for my bedroom, in addition to my portable automobile entertainment system for long family trips (doubles as a CD player). My only complaint is that sometimes the pictures freezes. This is one of the better deals because of all the accessories that come with the kit. The first one I bought had a faulty remote control, which audiovox replaced without any hassle. The screen is larger than many DVDs that are on the market today. Great product for the money."
2,don't plan to play rented DVD's on this,"This is an attractive player. The accessories were what sold me on it, and I was pleased with the package. I was disappointed, however, when I tried to play rented DVD's on it. It skipped very badly. I contacted Audiovox and was told that this is a low energy laser and that DVD's need to be clean to play in it. The same DVD's that skipped so badly in this player played fine on my husband's Toshiba laptop."
1,Buyer Beware,"Well, I've gone through two of these and both malfunctioned repeatedly. The first unit was a Christmas present. Worked the first time, then would not load dvds (several were tried) and once I got to work again it was very inconsistent, froze up, and often would not load. Put it in the car for our kids to watch in the second seat of our minivan and it took many tries to get it to work.After return to Target got a new one and while this one worked the first few times, it was not possible to hear it at full volume on a plane, a big disappointment. Once overseas, it started freezing up and doing strange things again.I've learned my lesson on this one. The Audiovox is not ready for prime time and i would recommend being very wary of this product."
3,Price Right,"I bought this unit from Amazon a this months because I was looking for a low-price portable DVD player with large screen. The player works great, but just be aware that the screen is 4:3.The screeen is 6.8"" not the 7""As such the actual screen size is much smaller than a 6.8"" or 7"" player with a 16:9 screen.Also, another minor thing that bugs me is that in spite of having a remote control, you cannot control the volume from the remote.And the picture quality and sharpness not as good as Panisonic."
5,THE BEST ON THE MARKET!,"I have tried them all, and this one works. I have several DVDs that freeze or skip at certain points of play that I tested at several offline retailers as well as Amazon.com. This unit comes through with flying colors. It played them all! The price is right. I highly recommend this DVD player.It also has amazing image resolution and sound. I have this unit next to my bed and use the input jack which is connected to my digital cable. When using ear plugs I can watch TV without disturbing the wife at night."
2,AUDIOVOX 1680 PORTABLE DVD PLAYER,i RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT TO USE FOR AIRLINE TRAVEL AND FOR USE IN MY mOTORHOME.i PLAYED DVD'S AND CD'S AND FOUND BEAUTIFUL SOUND AND PICTURE QUALITY.hOWEVER AFTER ONLY 3 USES THE UNIT COMPLETELY STOPPED WORKING.dISCS WOULD SPIN INTERMITTENLY AND NOT LOAD.i LOVED THIS PLAYER WHEN IT WORKED BUT I'M AFRAID TO TRY IT AGAIN.tHE PLAYER HEATS UP WITH EXTENDED PLAY WHICH MANUFACTURER SAYS IS NORMAL BUT IT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE BREAKDDOWN.
2,pretty but not very comfortable,This bra works okay but the material is really uncomortable. The lace cups isn't feel like flour sack material.
5,Finally found what i was lookin for,I heard Jerrod sing some of these songs in Texas and had no idea they were available. I think he is entertaining and has a great voice. I'm sure we'll hear from him in the many years to come
5,Great especially for a budding pilot or a lover of planes,My daughter (9 years old) received this as a gift recently and she loved it. She sat down looked through the entire book (it's not that long) and enthusiastically pointed out things to us she found noteworthy. It is full of great pictures and good general descriptions of the planes. I'd recommend this book.
1,Worthless Radio,"Mine quit working a few days after buying it. The radio portion will only work for 3-4 seconds before volume fades to zero. Tried to contact Oregon Scientific for warranty for over three weeks -- no one answer the phone and e-mails go unanswered (not returned as undeliverable, but simply not answered).I will never buy anything from Oregon Scientific again."
4,Very good,"It is my second favorite, it is written diferently than the other two. It's themes of finding love, and the new generation vs. the old. I'm glad the triology ended when it did; I don't think another book would have ended it as well."
2,it was ok thats all,"i have to admit the author did a good job of writing it,but ive read better books.mary anne is nice but i wish shed just get over logan.in the other books he ,like , ran her life.i think it was a good idea to bring sunny & MA together in 1 book."
4,A Good Entry in the Series,"This is a very good entry in Rosemary Rowe's interesting series of Roman Britian. Libertus and his patron Marcus solve a mystery involving the death of a very unpleasant character called Perennis Felix. Along the way we meet up with some fascinating characters and learn quite a bit about Roman life, particularly in Glevum (modern Gloucester). Very enjoyable."
2,not so soft,The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so. The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality.
2,Boring,"Starts out good, with a potentialy good story and a great cast. But then it drags on and on. Somewhere in the middle it should have ended. The movie is too long and too boring."
5,Another great book from Monty,"More horse sense from Monty. If you love horses and want to understand them better, Monty's books are a ""must read."""
5,For Millennial Man,"Monty Roberts has crossed the line from horses to the realm of people. It is about time. Monty reaches down to take out everything the horse have taught him and gives a straight-forward and pragmatic description of how people can better interact without physical violence or emotional domination. How easily his ideas move to families and the work place!This book is long overdue. While other books try their best to unearth their way into an aspect of human behavior, Monty uses his gentle style to sketch the framework for an entirely new way for human to relate with as little friction as possible.Books like this don't come often and are rarely couched in a way that is easy to understand and intuitive. It is truly a backbone work for Millennial Man."
1,Bad,No u bolts washers nuts wrong width don't buy this unfortunately I didn't see the other review before I purchased nobody else make this mistake
1,garbage,"it works good for the first week you have it (kinda) then its 30 seconds of shaking for 2 mins of light, mine completely stopped working after a month. this is junk!!!"
1,EVERLIGHT IS LITTLE LIGHT,LIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIGHT FLASHLIGHTS.THE PARTY THAT SAID THERE WAS ENOUGH CHARGE DURING SHIPPINS IS A LITTLE SHAKING IN THE HEAD. IT TAKES AT LEAST A COUPLE OF MINUTES OF OF SHAKING BEFORE THERE IS EVEN A GLIMMER OF LIGHT. AFTER THAT IF YOU DON'T CONTINUE TO SHAKE IT DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY.THIS LIGHT MAY POSSIBLY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE BUT THERE ARE OTHER LED FLASHLIGHTS WITH BATTERIES THAT ARE SUPERIOR TO THIS ONE. THE POWER USED BY THESE LEDS IS LOW AND THE BATTERIES LAST A LONG TIME.
1,"Reed switch doesn't work, the flashlight is inoperable.","I am helping my son with an electromagnetic induction science fair project and have studied extensively the requirements for these types of flashlights to operate. This flashlight is better than the 'fake' shake flashlight we'd previously ordered for $2.35 at amazon.com, because it actually uses a real NIB magnet and appropriate circuitry. However, the reed switch (which uses a small magnet to connect the capacitor's stored potential to the LED)doesn't work. Thus, the LED won't light. I'm very disappointed with this purchase. There are genuienly amazing shake flashlights that, both in function and design are truly brilliant devices, but they cost a lot more than this flashlight, so it seems that the old saying, ""you get what you pay for"", is proven true, once again."
1,Total Ineptitude,"First of all, the wrong product was shipped. I ordered the smaller light and the 11 inch version was sent.Secondly, the on/off switch on the light is very balky and requires an extreme amount of pressure to activate. The light was ordered as a Christmas present so there wasn't enough time to return/replace it. I'm sure I would have to eat the shipping charges which makes this item an albatross."
5,Organic Soy Beans,"Bought a soy milk machine. Now make quinoa milk, rice milk and soy milk. Big money saver and easy."
4,Good written book!,"This book is great! Best Voyager book I've read so far. The bad side: you don't understand everything at once. You have to read it twice. The bar scenes are missing but the first, the last chapter and a few comments like: ""Understand captains?"". There should be more breaks, for explanations for the reader. But not like in ""The Captains Table: The Mist"". There are too much."
2,I had the opposite problem as E. Alpos ...,"I was expecting a fun, campy b movie. Instead I got a well filmed low budget chick flick version of a zombie movie that took itself way too seriously. This movie had huge potential considering the story line. It seemed more like a lecture about the bad people who are wrong to hate others. Even going so far as to have the people speaking out against the zombies quote the Hitler. Most of the things they tried to make humorous failed to be funny. I would suggest saving your money if you are looking for a fun b movie. If you are looking for a zombie social commentary, than this is for you."
2,The truth,"The book was really written by Craig's mother Barb, that is why the one review picked up on the depression. His mother has always denied her son's problems. This is sad and hopefully someday she will come to the realization he will never be normal. Craig has competed everything with her by his side, she guides his hand on the keyboard, she speaks for him (which is really just her talking), basically she has completed school for him. Craig is a sweet person and he has a wonderful caring family. Hopefully someday his mother will come to terms with his physical and mental disabilities, when she does, it will help Craig more."
3,Good Value for the amount not so good of a product,We bought these as I hate to pay $11 at walmart for the same amount of tape. Although a good deal I would probably not buy it again as it seems to not stick very well to the box unless you use a lot of tape to wrap around the box. It also seems very thin and breaks very easily when pulled tightly. I've also had the problem with it crunching up fairly quickly when trying to use it. But if you want a cheap tape this is the one for you!
4,It's tape! You can ... tape things!,"I bought this 6 pack of tap to use in the free dispenser that the US Postal service gives you. I was moving. I used 5 out of the 6 rolls, [...]I feel like I got a good deal - and let's face it as long as it's sticky it's good tape."
1,Bad!!I false advertiser!,"I have to give them a negative-10! the add clearly says a 6pack so I ordered 5 sixpacs and the only sent me 5 rolls! Clearly false advertising! I even orderd some for my sister! What a rip off! Don't order from them!!!!!!!!!!!!Plus the shipping of $8 that is a RIP OFF!!!!!Scotch Sealing Tape, 1.88 x 54.6 Yards, Clear, 6 Pack (3690)"
4,stones in good form,"this is the sound of the ""corporate stones""....not the savage young stones bangin it out live,but nonetheless this is a great addition to anyone's RS collection.the sound is perfect......mick is in good form.....some different song selections...including a surprising factory girl......great for your next party."
4,This CD is great up until Brown Sugar,"If I never hear Brown Sugar, Jumpin' Jack Flash and Satisfaction again I could die happy. Other than these three which I just happen to be sick to death of this CD really rocks!"
3,Flashpoint?,The Rolling Stones Flashpoint is one of their badder live albums while Get Your Ya Ya's presents true rock n roll. It is well mixed and it includes guitar god Eric Clapton but the sound is too thin if you listen to the recording you will hear what I mean. It does include all of their hits everyone loves but it was not the stones at their best. For the most part Flashpoint is worth 3 stars. I think it is a great album considering I gave it 3 stars but the sound quality is not the greatest which is really too bad. Listen to the samples before you purchase it and enjoy!
4,"ah yeah, I remember how much fun Battlefield was!","If you're a fan of the origninal Battlefield series, this is your next fix :)What the!?! Who just sniped me!!Play it in the jungles, Freaking MOSQUITOES!!!Amazingly, enough people are still playing this on the free online servers to always be able to find a good game :)River boats, tanks, jeeps, motor scooters ;0 , lots of helicopters and planes, flame throwers, AA guns, caltrops, .. awe yeah!"
3,Only rec'vd one of the two discs,This is a great cd but I only rec'vd one of the two discs. I'm still waiting on the second.
2,This Cadillac Records ain't the Chess Truth,"As a piece of entertainment this movie may be OK. But why take REAL names of REAL people (some of them fortunately are still living) to tell a story which, for the most part, is completely inaccurate. Other reviewers have rightly pointed out the most blatant inaccuracies that this film carries. But as I have seen and met most of the artists involved in the plot (and for some of them - like Muddy who went dining at my home in Lyon (France) - I've had the fortune to know them personally) what worries me the most is that their personnality are also very inaccurate. For instance, Muddy who had an incredible charisma is portrayed here essentially as a very tepid character who thinks mostly to chase women. And Howlin' Wolf - a tough man certainly but a very bright and articulate one - is here portrayed as the terrorizing Wolf he PLAYED on stage and never out stage. The true story of the Chess saga (and the Chicago blues) is yet to be told properly"
2,A whole lot of mumbling going on,"The music is good. The actors competent. The movie leaves the viewer feeling that we've seen this story before. The dialogue is at times incomprehensible, detracting from the experience."
2,Good intentions gone awry,"I looked forward to seeing this movie - but it was a huge letdown. Besides the historical inaccuracies as detailed by earlier reviewers here on Amazon - I felt the actors chosen to play these music icons weren't based on ability, but to try and get a younger audience to pay attention to the film. Mos' Def is NOT an actor in any way, shape or form - his portrayal of Chuck Berry was wooden and inaccurate. On the other hand, Eamonn Walker's take on Howlin' Wolf was STUNNING. I'm sure the makers intentions were good - but the obvious budget restraints and poor choices in actors left me feeling like a great opportunity to shed light on an otherwise under-documented period of music history was squandered."
4,Blues with a feelin' that's what I have today,"Chronicles the birth of urban Chicago blues and segues into the eventual offshoot of the blues, Rock and Roll and Rhythm and Blues.The story narrated by legendary blues song writer and bass player, Willie Dixon is a bit embellished but captures the tension of the Chicago South and West side and the music that emanates from that tension."
4,Cadillac Records,"The rise and fall of Chess Records, which launched the careers of Muddy Waters, Etta James and Chuck Berry. Leonard Chess scoured the South, checking out the various blues scenes and selling records from the back of his Cadillac. The soundtrack, more than anything else, is what makes this movie so enjoyable."
3,"Poor battery life, Fair shave, Great trimmer",Shaver works good on my thick whiskers. I'm 56 and whiskers are grey and hair strands are getting thinner. This does not shave the thinest hairs. So I have to occasionally run the trimmer over my face to remove the finer hairs. Trimmer works great. Very precise. Battery charge only lasts 1 week. My old Panasonic which is now 3 years old held a charge for 1 month when new and is now down to 1 week. That's why I was replacing my panasonic was because of the poor battery charge life. So I'm using both. Panasonic for a better shave. Remington for trimming my beard.
2,zuchini recipe is bad no liquid needs 2 cups,"Hi allConsidering that these recipes are used to get the body ready to cure itself, they need to be tested by GERON. I tried the zuchini and rice recipe and was amazed that it did not state how much liquid to use. After the required 1.5 hours in the oven the rice was a mess.So, I placed all the ingrediants in the pot and cooked with water added 2 cups of it. Then it was fine. Obviously GERON had not used the recipe.IDIOTS as usual.Why can't people do it right?Capt GP"
1,This is not a useful text,I found this text to be amateurish and of little value. I can find more information on line or in the other Gerson material.
3,nice chart may not waste my money on it,"a nice chart but not necessary to have purchased I would recommend for a kitchen reminder but other then that, I am not sure why it would be worth getting"
3,I see an early Hugo trend here,"Reading through the Hugo's chronologically, I've just finished Double Star. As with ""The Demolished Man,"" this book could succeed totally independent from the sci-fi genre. It is a pleasurable analysis of politics. My first Heinlein book, and I enjoyed it. I've noted that I'll be reading several more of his novels that have won the Hugo. Interesting side-note to see his development of the character Penny. So 50's ish. Would never fly today!"
2,Not recommended,"I didn't really care for this product. While it did work, the signal was VERY weak and dropped off entirely quite frequently. It received a great signal...as long as I had line-of-sight to my access point. Put even one wall in the way and the signal dropped to about 25%. Take it from a certified PC technician: spend a few extra bucks and get something with much more range."
5,works through my condo floors,"Wireless depends so much on environment, but here in the burbs, in a nice old brick co-op, I have this device sharing my upstairs neighbor's broadband connection, via her Linksys wireless router. Signal strength is showing pretty low, but even fixing the TxRate at 11Mbps works beautifully, with no lost frames. There's an auto setting to optimize the TxRate in the event of an unreliable signal, and 11Mbps is way more than broadband needs, AFAIK.The installation under Win98 was accomplished seamlessly, truly PNP; it hopped right on the network and got all the info it needed from DHCP. Which reminds me, always restrict access to (and encrypt) your wireless network, unless you want to give free bandwidth to any chucklehead in a 200 ft radius. This chucklehead helps his neighbor with her computer pretty often and I plan on proposing that I continue to do so free of charge and/or share the costs. Power to the people!"
1,Disappointing,"The device randomly disconnects itself from the WAP. It may randomly come back again, but no guarantee. The new drivers from Belkin's web site have not solved the problem. Unreliable. Go for another product."
4,Works right next to my eMac,"My eMac's ethernet port died after lightning storm, so I bought this bad boy to be able to hook it up. It just worked. The software for OS X works great and I had no problems connecting to a NetGear router. The OS 9 drivers are a bit weird and the documentation is nasty.This is just what I needed, have been using it for two weeks without any problems. Could not verify the drops that others have witnessed because the adapter is 3 feet away from the router. If you are looking for a wireless network adapter that works with OS X (10.3.5 for me), this is the one to get.=============Update after a (almost) a year: It works, but if the machine goes to sleep, then it will disconnect and a reconnect from the belkin software is needed. Driver updates are non-existent, and the documentation is really not a good one. I'd drop it down to 2 stars if I had the chance again, they created the OS X driver in a rush just to sell a few more."
3,Cobra CBAntenna,Portable CB antennas just don't perform like those installed on your vehicle and this one is no exception. We get good reception from about a mile away from the vehisle but not much over that distance. The antenna is the one recommnded by Cobra for the portable CB that we have. It holds great to the roof even in high speeds. Very easy to take down and install.
2,Too weak of Mount,"I have not used the antenna...because I feel the magnetic mount is TOO WEAK!I like the size and it might work well, but I may never find out, since it feels like it would just slide off the vehicle."
3,bad sharpener,it does not really sharpen pencials as well as others likeX-Acto School Pro Heavy-Duty Electric Sharpener (1670)buy that insted. it is industrial with better quality
4,"Excellent, insightful and applicable.","Ever read a book of this type that just drones on and you say to yourself, ""just get to your point!"" Well, this one makes the point without being wordy. It's great to use for busy adults who want something thought provoking with great scripture referance. It's great for adult Bible Studies for folks that don't have alot of time for homework or prep but want to grow spiritually and be challanged on what was thought to be their Spiritual Gift(s). Only negative is that this rewrite from the original (1970's)could have updated some of the examples that adults under age 40 may not be familiar with."
5,Another wonderful effort,Nobody can spin a story from whole cloth like Munro. She is able to create meaning out of the smallest object and thought and carry the reader effortlessly into multiple minds and thoughts.
5,Save the Reaper,"The title seems to refer to a poem about reapers. I have been unable to find the quote. Help, anyone?"
1,Terrible,"This movie shared no commonality with the Green Gables characters except names. Hideously disappointing. If you're looking for quality representation of Montgomery's writing, stick to the first two. Don't subject yourself to this let-down."
1,Anne The Action Hero,"I was greatly disappointed with this movie. They might as well have called it 'Anne The Action Hero'. Instead of staying true to Lucy Maud Montgomery's story, Anne and Gilbert go off to the war, the war their children were actually fighting. Instead of seeing Anne and Gilbert settle into family life with their children, the writers instead made up this crazy movie with so many plots and basically a lot of chaos. It was so sad to watch this movie knowing that they had officially ruined the Anne of Green Gables trilogy. Sadly too, the movie was made so many years after the second one that Anne looks very aged. It would have been much more appropriate to follow her family life and watch her children growing and all the great adventures they had."
3,Haters gonna hate,"If you did yourself a favor and researched the plotline to this movie and saw how it related to the other movies then you wouldn't be pissed off you spent your money for nothing. Derp. Its still a good wholesome movie for the family, i haven't read the books but i still wouldn't care, its still good acting. Stop bitterly complaining before you scare other people off from getting this movie. Shame on all of you."
3,What's with the inappropriate flirting?,"This movie was easier to watch than I had anticipated given the horrible reviews. I found everything to be okay, however what was with the inappropriate flirting?There was a hint of promiscuity going on in this DVD, which certainly is NOT like L.M. Montgomery's chaste writing. This movie clearly degrades Anne, who almost has an affair with another man. In addition, in the Special Features section, it shows a scene of similar discomfort between Mrs. Rachel Lynde and Mr. Harrison. It was repulsive.I do plan on buying this so I can flip to my favorite scenes of Anne talking with Diana. However, I'm going to have to go back and watch the first 2 Anne of Green Gables and read the continuing books in the series to get this movie out of my head."
2,Fan Fiction with Anne Shirley,"First I have to say that I am an Anne of Green Gables book fan. I've read all the books several times. We all know that movies WILL BE different from the book upon which it is based. But this movie is a version of fan fiction. Kevin Sullivan took the AoGG characters and wrote a whole different story from anything L M Montgomery has ever written!! There is no resemblance between this series (movie) and the sweet flavor of the first two AoGG series (movies) he produced. If you are not a book fan you may enjoy this movie... if not, don't waste your money and read the books again instead."
1,NO STAR OPTION PLEASE!,"It's been several years since I watched this movie on PBS for the first time. I can't tell you how excited I was to hear that the final part of the AGG Trilogy was finally here! I even convinced my husband to watch as he knew how much I loved the first two movies. Til this day, I still cringe at the memory of that first viewing. WHAT A TERRIBLE MOVIE!!! For some strange reason, Kevin Sulliven chose to completely abandon the books and concocted this cheap melodrama that has the most random and ridiculous story line. How completely tragic. My husband was also in complete disbelief at how bad this final movie was; he felt very sorry for me."
2,What were they thinking.,"As a movie in and of itself, I thought this was passable, but I can't understand why it was made when it had absolutely nothing to do with the books. The first two movies at least stayed true to the feel of the books, even when because of time, and trying to condense things, many events were changed and condensed into one. I guess I just dont' see the sense in making a movie with these characters just for the heck of it. Even the timeline was WAY off. Anne and Gilbert's children were grown during WW1, they were involved, not the parents. If they wanted a war movie, they should have used the delightful characters of Anne's children. This also would have been more concinvcing, with Megan Follows as a fourty something mother, than a twenty something girl."
1,Anne of Green Gables The Continuing Story,"For those who fell in love with the first two installments of ""Anne of Green Gables,"" you need not waste your time on the final. Although it was good to see the main characters, Anne and Gilbert, marry, the Continuing Story is so far removed from the previous stories that viewers will find it difficult to connect them. The richness and wonder found in the first two films are totally absent in the final. After watching Continuing Story, I immediately threw it in the trash, then watched the first two again, and ""pretended"" the third didn't exist."
2,Not what I expected (or hoped for),"If you have not yet seen this movie, I would recommend that you rent or borrow it before you decide to purchase it. Hoping this new sequel would pick up where the movie ""Anne of Avolea"" left off, I was disappointed to watch and discover that the movie doesn't even show Anne and Gilbert together that often. The wedding that ""Anne"" fans have been waiting for was brief and rushed, lasting about two minutes of this three hour movie. After the wedding, the next scene the viewer sees is Gilbert going off to war. Honestly, I think my husband would like this movie more than I do given all of the war scenes. Though I enjoyed seeing the old cast reunited, I didn't feel that this movie was very true to the characters from the previous movies, and certainly not from the books. I plan to sit down and watch ""Anne of Green Gables"" and ""Anne of Avonlea"" all over again so that I may recapture the sweet romantic sentiment that this movie lacked."
1,Soooooo disappointed,"I was so happy when I borrowed this movie from our local library. Now I'm only happy that I borrowed it instead of purchasing it. The books were , basically, thrown out when this movie was made. I was so disappointed. I will not watch this sequel again. If you really liked the first two movies, I would not bother to watch the 3rd. It left me feeling sick to my stomach at such a gross departure from the books and story line."
1,What Were They Thinking??,"I am also a guy who loved the first two movies. It was a real treat watching these masterpieces with my wife and children. And then this hideous third go round comes along and I have to agree with everyone else. What was Kevin Sullivan thinking? When David O. Selznick produced Gone With the Wind and Rebecca, he made the BOOKS! Why? Because people loved them and wanted to see these stories on film. Both went on to win best picture of the year. So Mr. Sullivan takes Anne out of Avonlea in this third installment and makes her a spy in Europe????? The endearing Anne in the first two movies is nowhere to be found in this embarrassing mess. She is so serious and not very likeable and the story????????????? So what if Selznick had taken Scarlett O'Hara and made her a mud wrestler? Or had the second wife in Rebecca become an opera star? Ridiculous? You bet. I rest my case."
2,"I don't think Lucy Maude would like this ""adaptation""","I was a true ""Anne"" fan growing up and loved the first 2 movies, so I was excited to see this one come out. It was nice to see the old characters, and even Mrs. Lynde makes a welcome appearance, but overall I was disappointed with how much liberty was taken with the story. I much prefer it all as LM Montgomery wrote in the books and maybe being so familiar with the books was what spoiled the movie for me. I would have to say that the movie did not have a cohesive storyline, provided too many unanswered questions and unbelievable coincidences, and the character of Anne had sadly lost her magic and her spunk. Megan Follows and the rest of the cast tried, but they just had nothing to work with."
1,Boring,I would rather watch a documentary about the rate that toenails grow in a day observing them for a whole day. It Is Horrible! Do Not Buy!
5,We loved this movie,"Unlike many other reviewers, my daughter & I loved this movie, in part because Anne & Gil finally have a love that makes sense -- it's mature and passionate and deep, unlike the love of their youth. It may differ from the first two in many ways, but it still portrays Anne's charm & bravery. We rented the movie but will definitely buy it."
4,A pretty good movie,"I have never read the books but I have seen all of the movies. And I gotta say that anne 3 definately tops all of them. I'll admit the war story is a bit odd, but the romance is enough. The love Anne and Gilbert share in this movie is very special and it makes you wanna go out and find your Gilbert Blythe. There are a lot of kissing scenes but its so cute. The best parts are when Anne find Gil after singing their wedding song and when Anne wakes from a bad dream and then tells Gil about it and then Gil promises her that he will find Dominic and then Gil wraps his arm around Anne. But where was the wedding? I mean we have been waiting for this moment for a long time. And instead we get a lousy 15 minutes. Hmmm. >:[ But all in all this is an awesome movie and you should buy it! Its so touching and heart-warming and romantic.<3"
1,Wonderful Story,"My husband, our 18-year old granddaughter, and myself just love Ann of Green Gables. We've seen them all, and never grow tried of watching them. If you're interested in G-rated movies, then this is a wonderful choice."
2,Darcy,"On it's own, the movie is a very decent sort. However, it's quite disgusting the liberties Kevin Sullivan took with the storyline while pretending it was a continuation of the Anne of Green Gables story. I was very disappointed."
1,Don't Make the Same Mistake I Did...,"I bought this DVD despite reading all the negative reviews. Thinking that I would like it. What a MISTAKE!!! This movie is nothing like the first two that captures the love between Anne and Gilbert. I was bitterly disappointed and wanted to kick myself for spending the money to buy it when I should have just rented it. So, that is my advice, before you make the mistake of buying this movie, RENT IT FIRST!!! That way you can decide whether it is worth your money and your time."
1,A Big Disappointment,"The characterization and plot of this story are so different from the first two miniseries that it can hardly be called a sequal! I'm not a purist, but I think that a screenplay should at least be faithful to the spirit and vision of a novel/series, and this one fails miserably. The characters have the same faces, but their personalities have changed. They have been time warped from the late 1800's to 1914, and their behavior is unfaithful to their former portrayals. Take some advice--watch the last scene of ""The Sequal"", sigh happily, and forget you ever heard about this one."
1,"Def-Con 4. Total Turkey, even for a B movie","This movie gets one star because the war sequence itself, from the perspective of orbiting astronauts, is actually quite intense.The film itself? Retarded beyond description. ""Mankind can now rest in piece"". Yeah. Mmmkay.It only took a whopping two months after a full nuclear exchange between the superpowers to reduce Newfoundland to an irradiated landscape of cannibals and slave camps. Come on now.The astronaut who's wife was in Detroit (which you get to see nuked on a heat-sensitive camera) just 'happens' to survive? Come on now.Everything about this movie is hokey, all the way down to the pitiful acting and blatantly unrealistic conditions.If you're looking for a more provocative and believable film about the post-apocalyptic world, get ""Threads""."
1,Save your money for a nose-hair trim!!,"This is the sorriest excuse for a movie I think I have ever seen. it does have its good points, however, such as....uh...um...oh, yeah, it makes a wonderful ""gag"" gift, and should you get the friends together for ""B""-movie night, this is sure to be a crowd pleaser. If you are looking for academy award material, however, you are certainly wasting your time."
4,Inspiring,"One of the gravest dangers facing young men today is that they will be trapped in early, loveless marriages and waste the rest of their lives. As this book aptly demonstrates, pornography is probably the strongest countervailing force to the ""play for keeps"" sexuality taught in many schools. This superb book points the way to a genuine alternative."
2,NO Substitute for DSM-IV-R,"Although this text may be of assistance to some, it may also be used incorrectly and the criteria set forth in the DSM-IV-R is stringent, complete, and also complex. Do not confuse this edition for the one you will need when working the psych ward or in higher education seeking a degree in a psych or psychiatric related field."
3,Somewhat helpful,This title was somewhat helpful in my program. I will keep it around to review the criteria and hope it will become more useful.
2,Not what I was hoping for............,"I was disappointed in this package. There was no rhyme or reason, no direction, no coaching on where to begin. I was hoping to use it for my teenager and she was completely lost. If you want to learn the mechanics of the language, don't buy this package. If you simply want to memorize a bunch of phrases and words in French, I guess its ok. Definitely not what I expected for software in todays interactive environment"
2,Too many propellers,"I bought this book hoping to learn MS Project Server workflow from a functional utilization perspective. While the book covers the features, it fails miserably to connecting the dots in a clear manner. This has diminished this book to a reference guide. In the next edition, take note. Make the security model more clear. Make the portfolio feature more clear, etc., etc., etc.I have worked with many epm tools in a similar manner as a field consultant and this book as written for MS Project Server does not advance the practice.On a brighter note, you have a strong foundation, wear the shoes of a PMO leader to gain better understanding of what content is required in your next edition."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"I am a teacher in a high school, and we have these pencil sharpeners in our classrooms. The X-Acto model L is literally a piece of garbage - you could sit there and sharpen for 2 minutes straight and still won't have a useable point for your pencil. A kitchen knife would be easier to use to sharpen a pencil than this piece of worthless metal. Awful pencil sharpener."
5,Exceptional pencil sharpener,"I am a counselor and test coordinator in a high school and have used this pencil sharpener for the past two years. A colleague at a neighboring school recommended it to me as the best he had ever used. Although they insist it is not true, I believe my fellow counselors secretly covet this sharpener and probably wish they weren't stuck using a noisy, energy wasting electric sharpener. My X-ACTO L has performed admirably, having sharpened hundreds of pencils and I highly recommend it."
2,Step Back in Time,"Jack Nicholson is a staple of today's 'pop' culture. Today we see him at the Oscar's, being interviewed; like he has always been present. THE WILD RIDE is a step back BEFORE ""EASY RIDER"", the television westerns. I get the impression that his part in this film took very little effort to get into character. Car/hot rod buffs will enjoy what 1960's movie directors thought were the 'hot set-ups of the day. I would recommend this as an addition to round out your Nicholson collection, a early step in his development."
4,My favorite of his.,"As much as I like ""So"", sometimes it's a bit too commercial for me, and as good as ""Sledgehammer"" is, I don't want to hear it a 500th time. I think ""Us"" may be my favorite of his. Front to back it's just really pleasing. The first 3 tracks are beautiful slower ones, with ""Sinead O'connor"" singing backup on 2 of them. ""Steam"" was a hit, and is probably the ""Big Time"" of this record. There is a subtle world music vibe on many songs, but it doesn't dominate the album, like on Paul Simons ""Graceland"". My favorite song here is ""Digging In The Dirt"". It just seems to have everything good in it. Many of these songs are on his 2-disc ""Hit"" collection, but I could never get rid of this. It just seems made for people like ""Us""."
3,The Stormlands Story continues.,"Mr. Roberts continues the strong story about the story of a land in turmoil and the journey of a young man.The story continues as the evil antagonist from the first two novels continues towards his goal as king of the world.This time, the hero is one of the young sons of Hael, King and Hero from the first two books. Roberts keeps the theme of self-discovery going with personal insights to the young Prince, his companion and a brief look into the mind of Hael's enemy.Again, Roberts' theme of self-discovery is the core of the book. The action and descriptives are wonderful, and I particularly enjoy all the touches of primitive technology and the implementations of technology, new and lost in a primitive society."
4,Clean and simple,"The router has performed very well during a month of continuous use with Belkin and other wireless adapters and with a standard ethernet card--there is a 10/100Base-T switch. Setup was quick and free of problems.We have two minor complaints:1. After a cable modem service interruption, the router may require a reset to restore Internet access to the network. A reset may be accomplished, usually, via a web interface on a connected computer, so it's a small matter. (To be fair, we don't know how often our cable modem goes offline. For every time we have to reset the router, there may be 100 times when the router brings us back up transparently. Or not.)2. Indoor range is far less than that claimed by the manufacturer. This seems to be true, obviously, for every wireless system. We mention this for completeness.We are happy with the router and would be surprised to find a unit in the same price range that performs better."
1,"Bad PPPoE performance, terrible tech support","This router slowed my PPPoE internet connection down to a crawl, both wirelessly and even when directly plugged into the router. After multiple calls to Belkin tech support (with horrendous hold times) and several firmware upgrades, I finally gave up. Got a Linksys instead, and it works great, no slow-downs or dropped connections."
1,"So, it failed.","It seemed like a good idea at the time.But these are the old - 1st generation? - routers and this one just flat out failed.Plus, the package had been previously opened so it might have been a return."
1,(...),"(...)DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.It's a lousy piece of hardware. I gave it away and bought a Linksys router that actually worked as advertised.The Belkin tech support guy actually told me to ""call Microsoft because their having a lot of problems with their browser"". True story."
2,not up to expectactions,"While I did purchase this phone refurbished, I still expected far better performance from a 2.4 GHz phone. While distance has not been a problem, the quality of the reception has been poor since day one. I really do not use any other the features so I can accutately comment on those."
1,Lousy support after the sale,"We lost the handset. Called Panasonic to get a replacement, they would not sell us a replacement handset. Overall disappointed with Panasonic and this phone."
2,terrible battery life,"The phone has great features and reception, but the battery's need to be replaced within 3 months. I have 2 Panasonic cordless phones and this has been a problem with both phones."
5,Cusinart Chef's Classic Shine!!!!,"Need sunglasses when you cook with these babies...most beatiful shine and great temperature dispersement. Run the stove top flame/heat less than you normally would as this set is highly thermally conductive. Can scratch them easily so use wooden and high temp good quality plastic utensils. Need to sometimes use oven mits as the handles are not insulated from the pots and can get quite hot. Use care with the lid covers as well. But these are small things.The pots and pans hold heat very well and your cooking should improve. Suggest using a PAM product before you add butter or other fats as it makes clean up a breeze. After cooking, soak the pot or pan in hot soapy water and the clean up is easy. Recommend Cameo pot cleaner (non abrassive) for keeping these cooking tools dazzling. And don't forget the sunglasses! I have owned this set for almost a year and recommend adding the large skillet and cover and the steamer insert to round out the set."
5,Great but almost unfindable,"The two songs on this album (I heard the original ""What Do You See"" on a local radio station before Thanksgiving 1991, how I remember such times - have been recording radio since fifth grade).Took 17 years to hear this music again. What would we do without the Internet?The version on Another Minute is far from these similar versions. I don't like that 'industrialized' version. (I am not into today's style of music anyway - what happened to the good old times?)Good thing to bring back a childhood memory.Perhaps the rarest album ever purchased. Wish this were more mainstream!"
4,"Reader From Reading, PA","I liked this book, but there were alot of things in it, that I just skipped over, that did not capture my interest. But all in all it was good enough for me to loan it to people who I thought would get some use of it, like when she describes about being in the void and a few other things. Not a bad book at all."
4,Wish it was longer,I've been playing HU LHE exclusively for a living for about 5 months before I purchased this dvd. That said I think it is pretty good. If you are a beginner to the HU game it is a very good purchase indeed. It will take you immediately to a level where you will be very good against most fish. That's who you want to be playing anyhow.If you are already an advanced HU LHE player this unfortunately wont have much to tell you that you don't already know. I would love to see a part 2 with more advanced content though because I like the way the information was presented by Mr. Jacobs.
5,Wonderful excursion into the field and into history!,"I finished reading this in 2 days. I couldn't put it down - wanted to keep reading so that I could turn each corner with the author and other members of this excursion and see what fern, bird, or historical artifact would be observed next. I loved the extra background history about foods, artifacts, architecture, etc. The book truly took me right along with the group on their fern-hunting trip into old Mexico.Thanks for taking me along as a stow-away. I can't wait to share this book with my reading group."
3,The real Gem of this album is LOVE IN VAIN,Most of these songs have been played to death and quite honestly sound better in original recordings. But the one true hidden gem on this album is the Robert Johnson cover Love In Vain. For me its one of those songs you can play over and over a hundred times and get something new from it each time. This sounds absolutely amazing in a quiet room or car and the volume turned up. My recommendation is to buy the single and skip the album.
5,Great Live Stones,"I read that Charlie called this an overlooked live Stones album that he considered on of their best. After listening to this, I agree. Stunning song selection, filled with gems and treasures. A must for the diehard Rolling Stones fan!"
3,Enough with the ghostwriting,"Perhaps I'm being anachronistic, but I don't think an autobiography should be written by anyone other than the subject him or herself. If the person doesn't feel up to the job, he should have an authorized biography published with a vignette explaining his involvement in the project. Whatever her reasons, Ms. Abramson's decision to employ Richard Flaste was a big mistake. If she was too lazy to write this book herself, she should have at least taken the time to find a competent writer. Reading this book is like trying to drive across a treacherous bog in a Ferrari. You hope there's something good on the other side but the journey is so needlessly frustrating and unpleasant, you aren't sure if it's worth it. Let me save you some trouble. Even if you had a Range Rover, this journey wouldn't be worth it. My conclusion: for someone who is so assertive and logical in her public speaking, Ms. Abramson has published a very disappointing autobiography"
2,Dull But Intelligent,"I have always liked the way that Leslie Abramson handles herself as well as being a fairly big fan of her courtroom practices. So, I went into this book with some preconceived biases. Well, they were all proven wrong.Abramson is an extremely intelligent woman, and an excellent attorney, but her writing, as well as that of Richard Flaste, is quite dry and rather boring. She has some nice stories to tell, but the manner in which she delivers them is undeniably dull.The book clearly had no cogent flow to it whatsoever. The book was somewhat hard to get through, but I read on, hoping it lead to something better. But, it truly didn't.I gave the book two stars simply because the information on the cases, and the behind the scenes stuff was pretty interesting. Unfortunately, that is all this book really has to offer you."
5,absolutely lifechanging,"I am a somewhat cynical person; however, after seeing this film I was absolutely blown away. It affirms what I have known for years, but some had forgotten, that the best way to serve God is to serve your fellow man. Watching the devotion to others and to God that the people in this film exhibit under very trying circumstances has caused me to recommit myself to the cause. I highly recommend this film to those who, like myself, heartily dislike the standard vanilla ""Christian"" fare usually presented in the mainstream, but still would like to be able to view inspirational type films that relate this strongly to the real world. The joy that these people exhibit in worship and in daily life, set against the backdrop of addicts, gangs, and urban decay, makes me ashamed that I've not been more thankfull for where I am, and how little I've given back. If I could, i would give it 10 stars...."
4,Good film,I really enjoyed this film. It shows how situations can be made better when church and community are one. Amen.
3,Poor Production,"Peter Gabriel's second self-titled album suffers from poor production by Robert Fripp. The songs are strong in their lyrical value, but Mr. Fripp's production ruins their potential strength. Mr. Gabriel voice is an expressive instrument, but Mr. Fripp decided to bury the vocals deep in the mix. The overall production is murky and tough to listen to, but songs like the brilliant ""D.I.Y."", ""On The Air"" and ""Mother Of Violence"" work through the mess to stand out."
3,"Not his best, but he was learning.","I love Peter Gabriel. In fact, I'm a fan of his work since six years ago, and the more time I'm fan of his, the more I understand his musical concept and extravagant personality. But, thought it sounds illogicall, this album is which less satisfies me. It's not his fault, he was learning to be on his own, and this record is not bad. I think that Peter here is not as dark as in PG3 or Security. In fact, this album is one of his most accessibles, in my opinion. Nevertheless, mention appart deserves ""White Shadow"", ""Floatsam and Jetsam"", ""Exposure"", and maybe ""A Wonderful Day in a One-Way World"". The other tracks are not bad, but they are not showing neither the talent that Peter has shown in PG1, and even in Genesis' ""The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway"", nor the amazing genious that he would show in his posterior work."
3,Blast From the Past,"There's a lot to like about this fairly-well dated dance romp, starring a pre-pre Sex and the City Sarah Jessica Parker and a still winning Helen Hunt.It'll probably leave those refreshing their memories wondering what happened to former child actor Lee Harcourt Montgomery and watching SJP's stunt double with a jaundiced eye."
4,I wanna be on DanceTV!,"Surprise,surprise! Sarah Jessica Parker can *actually* dance! I enjoyed watching her and the other talented actors/actresses kicking their heels in this movie. The plot's pretty simple: Janey (Sarah) is brought up by her mom and extremely strict father, loves to dance, auditions for a dancer spot on Dance TV with best mate Lynne (Helen Hunt) and gets paired up with bad boy Jeff (Lee Montgomery) in the finals. Will her dream of becoming a regular on DanceTV come true?Get the DVD and see for yourself! ;)"
5,This is THE book for women who want lean strong bodies,"Brad Schoenfeld does a wonderful job with this book. It is well thought out -- and moves you from the beginning exercises to the advanced. I have been doing the beginner exercises for about 8 weeks now and have seen a tremendous improvement in my body -- and my energy as well.It is imperitive that you have access to a gym to work out. Or else you will have to have an extensive gym in your home.I really learned a lot from this book -- and have every intention to continue my work outs. I know that I can get to the advanced levels -- but I am moving slowly so that I don't injure myself.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about starting a weight lifting program. I have learned more from this book than from the ""personal trainers"" at my gym.Kudos to Brad!!"
5,Sculpting Her Body Perfect,I liked this book. I am trying to learn all about our bodies & how they work & how to get mine in shape & how to do it. It is an interesting & useful book.
4,sculpting her body perfect,"I am pleased with the purchased of this book, since I am exercising and very much focusing on toning my body. It has great ideas and pictures to follow along with exercise to help you follow."
3,Warning!,"There is much to recommend this book. Indeed, when Mr.Denby gets pedagogic the book is as good as it ought to be.Try reading chapters of authors you are familiar with--in my case those on Austen, Conrad and Woolf--and you willfind it does not get any better than this.However, Mr. Denby defeats his noble purpose by too muchpersonal self congratulation. Constant references to hiswife and two boys, his Upper West Side life style and hisdefence of bourgeois capitalism smacks of self justification,as though he needs to prove himself a ""regular guy"" in spiteof his academic jouney. There is nothing regular ormainstream about those of us who care about seriousliterature and I resent Mr. Denby bringing it down to thislevel. Had he steered from these digressions and just stuckto the task at hand, as in the aforementioned chapters, theoverall quality of the book could have been improved."
2,Not so deep,"Almost every book that Denby defends so wholeheartedly in this book is worth reading. Still, his exploration of the culture debates seems superficial. He is able to attend these classes and come out with basically the same opinions with which he left, having absorbed nothing of the justifiable rage of groups left out of the ""core curriculum"", smugly sure that the books he grew up with are the best that are out there. His dismissal of the liberal students' concern as ""tragically mistaken"" seems glib and self-satisfied, and the book is tainted by the bias of its author, whose purpose (to re-educate himself, to find himself) is defeated from the start by his closed-mindedness."

2,Facts on Jim Cramer's ............work+Book,"Let's start with facts first1. JC did a bad investment in TheStreet.Com, a money losing proposal.2. JC is quitting his job of managing hedge funds, and turn to journalism.My personal investing experiences tell me that, as an investor, when you hear a journalist tell you a story, you laugh at it, as you don't invest in the jokes. Books you probably could learn or should learn from are real classic books by Jesse Livermore(speculation legend), or Richard D Wyckoff(Accumulation and distribution theory, millionaire), or Buffeit(A true billionaire).You don't want to learn investing from people whose major is journalism.JC can't survive in this market, he still talks about it."
2,There is no such thing as out smarting wall street!!,Is there really such a thing as out smarting wall street? They could have easily titled this book how to buy stocks that go up and short stocks that go down. Remember this book is from folks who don't know how to make profit in the business they run? Do you really want to learn how to invest from these people?
1,Two in One Day,"I was doing some outdoor finish work around the house and decided to rent a finish nailer as my brad nailer was a bit light for the job. Instead of renting I decided to buy the Bostich 15 gauge. Excited to get to work I struggled a little to get the hang of loading the magazine. The magazine is plastic and has a bit of a unique loading procedure. Nothing like my Bostich brad nailer or my rough-in nailer. I finally filled it with nails and went to fire the first round...nothing. Checked the air pressure, hose and fittings. All was OK. Tried for 5 minutes and succeeded in firing maybe 3 nails, one every 15 tries. I took it back to Home D___t and got another one. Same model, same problem except this one fired once every 10 times. A two hour job ended up taking me all day running back and forth to the store. Never again."
4,Hurrah for Early Henry James!!,"Though nothing I've read so far compares to Portrait of a Lady, this novel is up there (with Roderick Hudson, The Bostonians, and What Maisie Knew) with his best work.Yes, it's a page turner with the standard James conventions - the European setting, the culture clashes and faux pas, the decaying nobility with their dark secrets, and wry humor.Very entertaining, and great for a summer read. I heard that Masterpiece Theatre is working on an adaptation."
1,"Doesn't work with XP, Terrible customer support.","Can't blame Amazon, but this webcam does NOT work with XP no matter what you try.I've waisted hours trying to install it, downloading drivers that don't work from the company's website (and other sites as well), speaking with customer support (who promised TWICE to e-mail me the drivers, but never did), and after all that trouble, it still won't work.I wouldn't even try any other Micro Innovations products, due to their terrible support and service."
3,Works fine with XP,"When you install the driver, it tells you that the driver doesn't have a signiture for XP. It's still a win 2000 driver, if you click OK, it installs and works without a problem. I agree that this is unacceptable... but it does not affect performance. It works fine.I've had no problems with the functionality of this device.Picture quality is OK for the price, it's all I need to see friends and family across the country. Be sure you have a lot of light... lower light produces images with a blue tint.My wife bought this to communicate with family. If I had made the decision, I would probably have bought one that had in integrated microphone. Probably the logitec when it's on rebate... But I see no reason to replace the IC100C.If you're looking for something cheap with no rebate hassle, this will do the job.. and for under $20."
5,Bullet in the Face,"Very tongue in cheek. Over the to humor, violent and sexual. I couldn't stop laughing It is only 6 20 minute episodes."
2,"Very good performance, but died after a year...","I bought one of these a year ago in Germany... I was very happy to have an IBM hard drive although they were made in Hungary... It was working well until a month ago when bad sectors started to corrupting my data... As I live in Argentina, IBM will not change the defective hard drive..."
1,Known to crash,6 mo. old drive works good but crashes when warmmed up. Was told they have faulty controllers that are sensitive to heat. Can't take a defragmentation with out crashing soon after in a 60 deg.f room
4,"this song is tight, some elements missing, :)","the A Cappella verson is so off the hook..i like this cd alot but i think the album verison is missin some elements..i cant wait to hear her whole cd.The Track DONT CRY is tight also, its a little bit different from any other slow jams but its hot :)"
4,Sturdy Realism,"This book provides a sturdy portrayal of Scandinavian immigrants living in the Dakota's in the late 1800's. Per Hansa and his wife Hans Ola are tough and determined, having left Norway to become homesteaders in the upper Midwest of the USA. Their existence on the plains includes remoteness, locusts, endless labor, sod homes, and harsh winters. They seem hopeful in America despite the hardships - although she didn't want to leave Norway. But for the many it was an improvement over what they'd left behind. This story is one of realism and determination rather than of joy.Author O.E. Rovlaag, himself a Scandinavian immigrant in Northfield, Minnesota, captures the experience of the many Scandinavians that settled in the upper Midwest. I read this book in high school class and found it a bit stiff, but with a memorable message of grit and determination. Readers might also enjoy the 1971 Swedish film on the Subject, THE IMMIGRANTS."
1,Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to watching Cher do her thing. It said it was filmed at the Mirage in Vegas? Such a small stage no room for her over the top numbers that I love so much. She wore better costumes when she and Sony did their TV Show. There wasn't any energy at all, it was as if she just walked through her numbers. Not to mention her singing, it seemed off key. Like I said I'm really disappointed with this DVD. Doubt I'll ever watch again."
4,Paganism,"This is a good book. However, there are better books available. If you are a beginner or inquirer, this is a good book to start with."
1,waste of money,i bought this for my kids to sharpen their pencils for school. we have had it since august 2010 this thing is truly a piece of junk. It wont sharpen straight now it wont sharpen at all wont stay still. This company should be ashamed to sell this product.
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this becuase I needed a sharpener for my classroom. It worked very well for about 7-8 weeks. Then the plastic bowl part that catches the shavings broke. I bought a second one, and the same thing happened. I would rather pay more money for one that lasts longer."
1,Don't Buy These!,"I purchased two of these pencil sharpeners for my 4th graders classroom and in less than a week, they have both broken. Do not purchase these for classroom use."
1,No Good,"The suction on the vacuum mount doesn't hold, the plastic casing comes off while you're trying to sharpen, spilling pencil shavings everywhere, and the blades leave a lop-sided point."
1,This thing is useless!,This only sharpens the pencil on one side and pops off the table every time I try to use it. I'm exchanging it tomorrow. What a waste of time!
2,Poor quality- broke after a week use.,"Purchased for a collective playroom. The toy arrived is great condition: fun design and great colors. Adults and kids loved it! But It stopped spinning only after a week. The frog just wouldn't go down, as if something was blocked inside. There was nothing to be done, and the toy was useless as it was. I had to throw it away, which was very disappointing for a Chicco toy."
5,superb lit,"I loved this book. Wynne has a cool, easy, intelligent, original style, unencumbered by the obvious ego that mucks up so many books. He loves his characters, doesn't sentimentalize or trivialize them, just lets us know what's going on in their heads without judgment, superimposed morality or high-flown drama -- these excellent stories show humanity in all its weirdness, beauty and multi-dimensionality. More, please."
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this unit because I wanted to replace my CD changer and finally add a DVD player to my setup, all in one nice package. The picture and sound quality have been great. I used the component video and optical sound outputs. I highly recommend buying a DVD player with these output capabilities if your system accepts them. But the overall quality of the unit is poor. The buttons are cheap. This seems silly but you'll know what I mean when you use the unit. There is no jog dial, on the remote or unit itself, an item I now realize is a must have -- fast forward and reverse are a pain, and you will be doing both a lot I found as a new DVD user. Finally, as in other reviews, this unit is very s-l-o-w on start up, open/close, play, changing discs, etc. Nice unit, but there are better."
1,Another one bites the dust....,"I've had this about a year and a half. I liked everything about it, but a few months ago it started skipping sometimes when playing CDs. I tried using cleaning disks but it's just gotten progressively worse, now it's just too annoying to play a CD. I called Toshiba and they said the CD lens probably needs to be replaced, I called an authorized service center and that would cost $150. haha.We had a Sony before that likewise died after about 2 years...From reading reviews, it seems that anywhere from 30-50% of even high-end CD/DVD players won't last more than 2 years.It really is ridiculous."
3,prompt notification,"this is the first time that i have used the one-click method of making a purchase.and i have been waiting for about thirty minutes for confirmation via-e-mail.is it my imagination,or is the other way quicker?"
4,Picture quality is excellent,"Like other reviewers, there are things I'd like to see changed on this product. However, the bottom line is that once you start a slide show, it works very well and has an excellent picture. For the price, this is a great digital frame.Most digital frames don't have internal memory so that is not an issue. SD cards are so cheap, who cares? Many digital frames don't accept a USB device so that is a real plus for this unit. While it is true that grandma may have a little trouble figuring this out, I didn't buy it for grandma and anyone from the digital age could get this up and running w/o ever looking at the instructions.My only complaints are:1 - The remote sensor is on the top behind the edge so remote functions must be done from above.2 - I wish there were a few more choices for sideshow duration (I'd like to have a picture up for 5 or 10 minutes).All in all, I highly recommend this unit."
4,Great way to show off your photos!,"This is a really nice product. Looks good, functionality is great and very easy to use."
4,Axion AXN-9700 7-Inch Widescreen LCD Digital Picture Frame,"This is a great frame for the price. Since it is only a 480 X 234 display, it doesn't do justice to high quality landscape shots but if you need a low resolution display in widescreen format, this will do the trick. If you are after a high resolution widescreen frame, you are going to have to spend a lot more money than this."
3,Good price but resolution not great,I am am not as happy with the resolution as I had hoped. I suggest potential buyers look as samples in stores and note what resolution which you find acceptable to compare with the technical specs of on-line digital picture frames. More magapixels doesn't improve the display but it does increase the loading times. A nice feature is that the batteries allow it to be passed from hand to hand. Another aspect that I don't like is that the display area is wider than typical diginal photos so that there is either back bars on either side of the photo or it gets cropped on top and/or bottom.
5,Great frame at a GREAT price,"I was lookin for a big frame without the big price, this is perfect!! Very easy to use I bought a 256m sd card filled it with about 130photos and just put the card in, after adjusting the brightness I was all set, its very simple to use, and for the price well worth it!!!"
1,Do not purchase,"First off, the frame was black, not brown as displayed in the picture, which was a major reason why I bought this item in the first place. After we had plugged in the memory card and turned it on, it only worked 3 times before it stopped displaying the pictures. It would say slideshow but show a blank blue screen. I don't know if we just happen to buy a lemon product, but as a result I will not buy any Axion product ever again."
1,Worst Digital Picture Frame Ever,"Reason why this product is not recommended by me:The transitions between photos takes too long (2.5 - 3) seconds.It is not as smooth as the other brands I've seen in stores.I put 2 different kinds of SD cards in the unit to view my photos.After taking the cards out, all of the photos were destroyed and can be only viewed by using the axion unit. I tried every means possible to retrieve or fix the photos. I tried Bad Disk Pro, various card readers, everything. I also did everything I could to figure out where I could send the unit for repair, but Axion has very little to no info online. Stay clear of this unit and this company."
2,No quality,"For a cheap first try into digital frames, this one's not too bad. However, there are reasons why it's cheaper - most importantly, the screen quality is nowhere near good, at all. Pictures are blurry and colors too shiny. Pictures also take a good 5 seconds to show up in the slideshow mode. Other than that, the frame itself is cheap plastic, and there is no USB port, which is a huge bother. I guess it's a cheap mistake - but it's sure a better idea to spend some more money and buy a frame where pictures show up as they should."
1,Don't Waste Your Money...Distorted Picture!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have two 8"" picture frames that are other brands, and they are GREAT and I use them for Open Houses all the time! I got this one as a gift from a friend, and it is terrible!! The instructions are difficult to understand. The wide screen makes everyone in the picture look FAT and distorted! This is a weird size and I am not happy at all!! I don't recommend it."
4,Nice product for the price,"Bought this as a gift and works just fine. Just as the other reviews, this DOES NOT come with a remote as described. Accepted the momory stick just fine. Full picture did not come on the screen, but I haven't tried to adjust anything yet. Hopefully that won't be an issue. I'd give it 5 stars if it came with a remote as described, but that would probably get lost later on anyway. All-in-all, not bad."
2,Lousy picture quality,"When I bought this, it was the most affordable digital picture frame so I thought to give it a try.Unfortunately, the pictures did not turn out as good as I had hoped.I even resized it so that it doesn't have to resize itself but 480 x 234 pixels doesn't really help.I realized that I had to go for about an 800x600 pixels to get a quality that I can accept so I returned it.The only good thing was that you can put batteries in it to make it mobile unlike many other frames."
3,Great multiplayer. OK single player.,"I'll begin by saying that the multiplayer features are very entertaining. Being able to customize your player's appearance, taunt other players, and watch players dance around during play is hilarious.However, the single player game is not as developed as some other golf games I have played. If you try to hit the ball when a player's animation sequence starts, nothing happens until the animation is complete and then the swing starts unexpectedly. Some of the announcer's comments don't make any sense. Of course, you can turn the comments off. Also, the program crashes in the middle of a game occasionally. Although a crashed game can be recovered, sometimes the program continues to crash on the recovered game. There are other frustrating areas, but all games have their quirks.Overall, this game is great for multiplayer but, if you're looking for something to play by yourself, you should definately shop around first."
4,Founding Father,"It is unfortunate that Washington has been reduced to an unsmiling portrait on a one dollar bill, the story that he had wooden teeth, and a fable about him fessing up to chopping down a cherry tree. Here was THE founding father of our country. In an era of great patriots: Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Henry, they chose him to be their leader. It is not unreasonable to state that if it were not for Washington there would be no United States today. Brookhiser successfully examines Washington the icon and gives us insight into Washington the man. Washington's accomplishments are staggering to consider. He had the sagacity to defeat the most powerful military force in his time AND launched a new nation that would endure throughout the ages. This book should be read by every American. In a sense he is a father to us all. I wish the book was larger in scope."
2,Luke-warm outline of a great American's life.,"In ""Founding Father"" Richard Brookhiser attempts a moral biography of George Washington which focuses on his public life, all in order to bring him closer to us 200 years later. While a noble effort, Brookhiser does not follow through. Although mildly interesting, this book is too sketchy and reads as a mere outline of a more comprehensive work. There are better works out there that bring Washington closer to our hearts than this one."
3,Lost without Banks and Rutherford,"Let's be honest folks Gabriel is not as great as he has been made out to be. Actually, I think Banks' solo outings are more interesting and that is not saying much. I do like Games without frontiers and I like the progressive vibe throughout some of the songs. But, overall this is minimalistic garbage that somehow attracted an audience. I really can't understand why Phil and Pete became so popular. Both put out some of the most banal lacking music of the 80s and 90s. At least we still have their wonderful work of the 70s."
1,A Very Disappointing and Frustrating Book,"I have no doubt that Basil Pennington is a very loving and well-meaning man,and an expert on his subject. But he is also very maddening.If you want to know about the background to centering prayer then probably this is as good an introduction to that aspect of the subject as any. But if , like me, you actually want to know how to do centering prayer, then don't bother with this book. It tells you just about everything you could wish to know about the history, benifits, and application of centering prayer (it even tells you how to structure centering prayer retreats and seminars). But unbelievably, within its 254 pages Pennington devotes little more than one page on how to actually do it, and what he does say is vague and interspersed with latin phrases. I have the impression that Pennington has written something more explicit somewhere, but this book is definitely not it."
4,Heed my advice!!!,"I had a lot of trouble getting this to work with Windows XP, but to all those people out there who are having the same trouble, THIS CARD WILL WORK, it is just a real pain getting it to do so. After spending hours trying myself and using tech support, I figured out the problem on my own. First of all, you must download the XP drivers from the Belkin website. THEN, you need to use the utility that comes on the CD rom, *NOT* the generic one for Windows XP. Besides the setup trouble, the card works fine, the price is right and I have no complaints [now]."
1,Will NOT work with Win98se,"Tech support states that this card is known NOT to work with win98se (F5D6020 ver.2). BEWARE trying to install the Compaq WL100 card's driver as a work around. My 98se box just kept VXD-blue screening after I installed the compaq WL100 driver trying to get this belkin card to work. Both cards may be based on the PRISM-2 wireless chipset, and this MAY or MAY NOT work for windows 2000 (as reported also in these feedback results), but it definitely is NOT a workaround for win98. I can see the card alright in device manager, the lan monitor utility comes up ok, but the card will not save settings for WEP or anything else....I.E. the card cannot be configured using win98se."
1,Don't buy ! get Orinoco Gold instead!,It's a poor quality card ! Getting it to work with XP is one pain and then software and else !! This card doesn't give you a good range (others do very good ) and is not supported by many softwares (such as Boingo.com) and networks and is not recommended either ! So I would definately ask you not to buy this card please ! unless you are a computer expert and like to deal with challenges and deal with a poor range !
1,Does not work well with Windows XP,"Windows XP includes a utlility that allows setup of a wireless network card. This card is not recognized by XP as such, and the setup is next to impossible. Sent mine back and bought a different brand."
2,recording quality flaws po' lightnin,"yes, the tracks on this album are quite good. but my problem with this disc is the recording quality. granted, these are old recordings, but the archaic ""hiss"" that accompanies old country blues recordings is not the annoying ""hiss"" on this CD.i bought this lighnin CD and returned it the same day; try 'double blues' or 'lightnin! '.if you want some early lightnin, the BEST set is the 'complete alladin recordings,' for its price and number of tracks."
5,Great intro to a great character,Really enjoyed this book. The area (covered by the plot) was relatively small but this allowed for the development of some great characters.
2,Typical of current technology,"This keyboard works about as well as any of the wireless keyboards I've used. As usual the pointing device works about as well as that of any laptop (pretty bad). It also sometimes misses, or doubles up on keystrokes. The internet keys across the top are a waste of time, mainly because the included software is pretty poor. It does not integrate well with Windows XP, and appears to have been written for a much earlier version. As usual, no Linux version of the software. Keep in mind though, I've tried many wireless keyboards in the past, and they are all pretty much like this one."
1,Not up to par,"Bought this keyboard after having previous experience with an RF Wireles Keyboard + Mouse from memorex. Was interested in a combo unit. The range of this unit is barely 8ft with many ""blind"" spots where the signal drops out. Very unlike the memorex unit. It's possible I just got a defective unit. But an online review from another person listed simliar problems. Avoid. Hope someone can find something better."
4,a movie fan,"The story is delightful even if sad in the ending. Good photography and a good dubbing to English. Print wasn't as good color as I remember the original, but then tape doesn't retain color as well as a disc. Nevertheless, a good value for the very low price I paid for the videotape."
2,Elvira Madigan,I have bought this DVD for my father who heard about this movie years ago and tried to buy it for a lot of time and did not find it. I asked him if he enjoyed the movie and he told me he was quite dissapointed. It is not what he expected to be.
5,portable,great antenna you can use on any kind of vehicle and move from car to car to another car or to a truck or? Well you get it works well and magnet holds great
1,Very poor quality!,I wasn't very impressed with this antenna at all. Upon taking it out of the box the rubber cover that is supposed to be wrapped around the magnet mount fell on my garage floor. This thing is a cheap piece of junk. Save your money and your time and get the Little Wil. The rubber that is wrapped around the magnet is beyond cheap and the rest of the antenna is not very impressive either. Mine went back to Amazon.
4,Different than I expected,"The book dealt more with her social/personal life than with her as a journalist in the aftermath of the war. The book is well written and very readable, I had just expected more of a post-war history.I'm sufficiently intrigued by her story that I've already bought her other biographical book, ""Borrowed Finery,"" and look forward to reading it.Coleen from Kent, Wa"
4,Great Nicholson Film,I know the critics didn't seem to like the film but it is a good follow-on to Chinatown and a classic film IMO.
4,The Two Jakes,Not a bad film and if you enjoyed the first one you will most likely enjoy this one. It is not the masterpiece that was Polanski s film and it doesn't flow as well. Also there are moments in the film that go against the establshed mood. Some of these moments come off as overly melodramatic to almost borderline camp. The true saving grace and what makes this film worthwhile is Nicholson's performance. Revisiting the role of Jake later in life and to see how much more jaded he is and not nessesarily wiser. This film does tie into the first very directly and that surprised me a bit. It happens early and in a way telegraphs the very ending. But nonetheless it was a fun if uneven journey.
2,poor,It was a story that had a man threatening to kill people and the same man dying and crying because he had cancer and I am thinking that was the basis for the whole plot.
1,"Very large, does not synch to fit -hangs off the body","I was disappointed in this product. It's really big and hangs off of me, there's no way to fasten it tighter or synch it - The only way for me to wear it is for me to strap myself in using sail-ties from my boat or other ropes... it looks (and feels) ridiculous) If you are on the fence, please take this into account -you might be better off spending the money for something more sophisticated than a cut-out piece of burlap with pockets and no fastners..."
1,Missing weights,"When the vest arrived it was supposed to have 20 - 2 pound weights (bags of sand) and it arrived with only 19. I tried to contact the vendor to get the weight that I paid for, but I was unsuccessful. If you don't mind sewing a little bag and filling it with sand, then order this vest."
2,Romantic Snooze,"For those of you who found ""The Philadelphia Story"" a witty rom-com about the upper crust will enjoy this film immensely. For those who found it a ponderous bore should avoid ""Holiday"" at all costs. ""Holiday"" is the more excrutiating of the two films with characters even less interesting. Despite their Herculean efforts to breathe life into this inert material neither Cary Grant nor Katharine Hepburn makes you care much about their characters. The fault lies not only with an uninteresting script but also with the lackluster direction of George Cukor, probably the most overrated director this side of Vincente Minnelli. Yawn!!!"
4,Holdiay - for Any Day of the Year!,"This is one of our go-to, feel-good movies. If you appreciate the old films, this one is lesser known and great fun. It is perfect for after Christmas - when you are still in the mood for a holiday movie - or for July, when you want that holiday lift, but a Christmas movie just seems a bit much. Cary Grant couldn't be more charming, and Katherine Hepburn is the black sheep of the family Grant plans to marry into. Edward Everett Horton and Jean Dixon are Grant's delightful friends in this perfect romantic comedy."
4,Smiles abound,This is one of my favorite Cary Grant romantic romps. The DVD itself is good quality. I am very happy I purchased this classic.
2,Too small,"The color is great and so is the feel. I love jersey knit. I have a pillow-top matress and the fit was pretty snug right off. I wish I would have returned them right away, because I knew that once I washed them they would shrink. I did tumble dry on low, but they shrunk considerably, and even with stretching they are just too small for my mattress. These are not meant for a pillow-top. So I gave them away to someone who has a full and they fit perfectly."
4,Good Value,"Good Value for your dollar. Not ""out of the ordinary"", but as good as I expected. The ""Sage"" is not what I envisioned, although it's a pretty color. It's more the color of the inside of an avocado -- a bit more of a dull lime-green that what I would call ""Sage"""
5,Super Soft Jersey Knit Sheets,"I have been using jersey knit sheets for the past 3 years for all of my beds. These sheets are far superior to any brand that I have gotton so far as you would expect from Northern Lights. They are thicker to begin with while still being lightweight enough to use year round. They are very soft and hold up well in the wash. The fitted sheet, even after going thru the washer and dryer still is plenty big to accomodate my overstuffed mattress.I would recommend to anyone that you buy these sheets."
1,SO . . . what's the big deal?,"This wasn't my kind of singing. Peter sounded like he was straining to get his words out, though I must say the instruments used in the songs were well done (drums were especially good). The only song that impressed me was the very first track on this album, Red Rain.This is a CD you'll regret buying. You'll find yourself sitting in your room (listening to this perfectly horrible collection of nursery ryhmes) rueing the moment you handed the cashier your hard-earned money..."
5,"peter gabriel, des SO(US) !!!","Le meilleur album du Sire, parce que dépouillé et clair, le ""So"" de l'Ange Gabriel frle nos abmes et touche du doigt nos plaies faites d'incommunicabilité et de désirs mal étreints. C'est avec plaisir qu' ""I hear that voice again""and it's a redit's a redit's a redit's a red rain's gonna fall"
5,peter gabriel hits the big time,"peter gabriel's so is his most successful album. the hit songs are sledgehammer at#1,big time at#7,and in your eyes in the top20. other good songs are red rain,don't give up,this is the picture,mercy street,that voice again,and we do what we're told. i have enjoyed listening to this album again,thanks peter. ed wilson"
4,A Good CD but...,"This is a very good recording. But it is not the best that PG has in his catalog. Depending on whether or not you are a lifetime follower of PG or just a bandwagon SO follower. PG has some mezmerizing work, Security/PG3 and even UP are better than this.. but don't get me wrong, this is a great cd, and I am glad that PG made it, because US was not as commerical and UP is way out in space like his early work.Merit, but not as great as his early stuff, or his new stuff.. and how many artist can you say that about?"
4,Excellent but definitely a Step Down,"This is Gabriel's first thoroughly Yuppie-Friendly album & though meticulously crafted, a definite step-down from all 4 previous albums. The weirdness & bizarre elements that made his first four masterpiece albums so dangerous (and they're all masterpieces with 3 & Security being the peak period)is toned down towards sentimental overstatements like ""Red Rain"" & ""Don't Give Up,"" infectiously silly but quite shallow hit tracks like ""Sledgehammer"" & ""Big Time"" ( rather than awesomely nutcase ones like ""Shock the Monkey"" & ""Games Without Frontiers"") & the album would get only 3 stars if not for great 3 track combination of That Voice Again, In Your Eyes & Mercy Street & the great ""We Do What We're Told Milgram's 37"" that comes after the annoying distraction of the loud & funky ""Big Time."""
3,probably worth a 3.5,"how much you like this album depends solely on how well you can stomach a peter gabriel hit, because the three biggest ones are right here: ""sledgehammer,"" ""big time,"" and everybody's favorite, the genuinely wonderful ""in your eyes,"" as haunting and subtle a love song as ever topped the charts. me, i like peter gabriel, but this isn't one of my favorite peter gabriel albums."
5,Classic,"So it was, So it is. Remains an integral part of any music collection. A must have for Mr. Gabriel fans."
1,Beware this outdated software,"This software is designed to run on a monitor at 640x480 resolution. This means that if you are using a relatively new computer (less than 5-6 years old) your resolution is probably greater than 640x480. If so, the game area will not fill your screen, rather it will shrink depending on how high your resolution is. The window you are running in will fill the screen, but Sierra fills the space not used by the shrinking game area with black. My monitor is a couple of years old, but was designed to run at 1280x1024. The actual game area uses about the center 1/3 of the screen. The card backs on the Solitaire are so small I have to strain to read them. I guess you could change your screen resolution before you play and then change it back afterwards, but that makes the game too much trouble for me. It is a shame too, because the games are quite good (probably 4 stars) if you can see them."
4,"Dynomax Turbo Muffler (""Thrush"")",Nice sound without being too loud. Seems to give somewhat better performance and gas mileage. Very well constructed - a great value for the money.
2,One dead star = A dull read,"The premise of this sci fi novel is interesting enough: four men are sent out to investigate the discovery of a dead star. They arrive on the ship by means of a matter transmitter (like a teleporting device) because the ship is already so deep into space. Now you know that tragedy will eventually strike, but it's difficult to get around the science to the real reason for the accident. Occasionally Pohl gets too deep into scientific statistics, but then again, some people enjoy that realism. I, however, don't. The flat characters add little to the book. There are lots of conversations between them after the accident, but these are not deep characters; you understand most of them pretty quickly after they are introduced. Although there is a nice dose of suspense, the lack of any interesting plot or characters made this a book I wished I hadn't spent any time on even though I finished in two days. Science fiction fans should look elsewhere for excitement."
2,Not as helpful as Lonely Planet,"I recently took a trip to Europe and needed 3 language books. I had Lonely Planet books for French and Italian then bought this book for German. I was really disappointed in this book after having used the Lonely Planet books prior. The menu translator, in particular, is lacking. I could hardly find anything from the menu in this book...and I went to Oktoberfest. I'm sure the food served was traditional German food so why wasn't it in the book? Next time, I'll stick with Lonely Planet."
3,fine for travel,"I really liked the pronunciation guides and the phrases, but i had difficulty finding the specific words that I wanted. For example, I couldn't look at a restaurant menu and then look in this book and figure out what my food options were. Probably works better for a touristy trip, than my permanent move."
4,The Sacketts/ Crossfire Trail,"As always we received the DVD's in record time from USA. Both DVD's were excellent and as they were from Louis L'Amour's books which my husband has all of his books, we did enjoy the films.We like buying off Amazon as we know we will get a good product.Thank You"
5,The Sacketts Rock,As a western movie fan I am very pleased with this series L'Amour created for the written page that is so well adapted to the screen world. Well worth the viewing time.
1,Where is it,"Ordered this and it never showed up, as usual Amazon made things right with a quick refund"
3,Narrow shoe,These are beautiful shoes. A bit dressy but very nice. The only problem is that they are rather narrow even though the description says that they fit medium widths.
1,Does not fit 2005 Tiburon GT 5 Speed,"This is not a direct replacement for a 2005 Hyundai Tiburon GT 5 speed Manual. It is a massively inferior product and to use it you would have to pull out the existing half shaft that is attached to the transmission as well as the bracket on the engine block that holds it in place, thereby making the front end substantially less stable.Avoid this bogus product like the plague."
3,good history on D-Day,"exciting and interesting story though some parts about the preparation and training for the mission a bit teidous at times. This book sparked me into purchasing a Dvd copy of the ""longest Day""."
5,Fantastic story about true D-Day heroes,"Great story of the British glider troups that captured (and then bravely held) the bridge on the eastern edge of D-Day beaches in early hours of June 6, 1944. One of the great rarely-told stories of D-Day. Very easy read, great maps and photos. Once started, can not be put down!"
4,"A GOOD STORY, TOLD","Stephen Ambrose's book tells the story of D company, 6th para. and the taking of the bridges over the Orne canal and river. It is an excellent, if skimpy, telling of one of the facinating stories of WWII. I have always found the incident interesting since seeing it portrayed in ""The Longest Day"" It is a quick read, and I'd have liked more detail, but it is a good book none the less."
2,Do not buy if you like war action !,"I had lot of expectations in this book. Unfortunately, the most important fight in the early hourd of D-Day were very little covered. Too much silly episodes, rather than a more comprhensive description of the firefight. On the other hand, you can find a very good introduction of training of company, the glider landing and the first minutes of the combat. After all, after LT. Brotheridge died, nothing more is clear, there is not anymore a storyline, it seemed that the author had to finish the book at a glance."
4,More history!,Interesting story telling of the hardships of the pioneers. They truly had a tough time of it and most have wanted to go to Oregon in a big way.
3,NOT Kenderish.,"Legendary Uncle Trapspringer? The first 30 pages have nearly nothing to do with the plot. Some story. As it is, I only got past the 30 pages, and am extremely disappointed. Where's the famous Kender humor that we love Tas for? Not present. Dull, boring....TSR's editors and writing staff are decaying. And it shows in this book."
1,Deceptive description,The description leads you to believe you will be getting 21 1 quart bottles. Which is awesome for $15.98. Its actually only 1 bottle. A very pricey quart.
2,"phone is ok, but no power-batteries not included","Not only is it cheap, but it doesn't come with any batteries. Then if you want to get power to it without batteries, you have to buy a ac adapter that costs twice as much as the phone."
2,Don't Expect It To Last Very Long,"Good features, but the materials and manufacturing quality are woefully sub-par. The display broke after one year, and the dial tone disappeared after two. Although customer service is helpful, the 1-year warranty is basically worthless. If you expect a corded telephone to be reliable for many years, then you may wish to keep searching for a higher quality model."
3,Good for an afternoon of escape.,"I read books to go get lost in them and although this book is not one I would have choosen in a book store ( my Mom gave it to me) I did get into it. The story is good and I liked the characters what do I care if the places the Author used are made up, I knew when I starting reading the book it was FICTION. Good for getting wrapped up in others romance for a lazy Sunday."
1,Save yourself the bother,"whatever you do please do not buy this album. as a verve fan since i first saw them in 1993 i was hoping against all hope that somehow richard ashcroft could possibly rebound from his steady decline since the end of the verve. however, this album sinks to a low which i could never imagine. he has become a middle of the road balladeer with none of the fire or passion which set him apart earlier in his career. upon buying this album a friend and i listened and were overcome by the sheer ridiculousness of the album. we actually laughed more than once at the overblown lyrics. what exactly is ""restless swagger"" anyway. say your hopes and money on possibility nick mc cabe will one day make an album to remind us all why the verve were great."
3,Hit and miss,"I'm a huge Richard fan...There are a few tunes on this one that I think are great, but a lot that I just skip through. My favorites are Check the Meaning, Buy it in Bottles, and Lord I've Been Trying. A couple of others are catchy too, but I was disappointed with Nature is he Law, the collaboration with Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. It's just not inspiring at all..."
4,Good sprinkler,"Having owned this sprinkler for over a year, I have never experienced the problems reported by the other reviewers. It is true that it is a little difficult to do major adjustments when water is flowing, but that is because the water is putting pressure on the gears. You can easily make minor adjustments while it is running, but it is better to stop the water before making big changes to the pattern setting. The sprinkler is solid and performs better than the many cheaper oscillating sprinklers we have owned previously. The only suggestion I would make to the manufacturer is to make the nozzles removable so that if a small object inhibits the water flow, it is easier to remove."
3,Plot holes the size of Utah,"So why did he have to make a decision of shooting him or pulling the chute? How about shooting him, dropping the gun and then pulling the chute with the SAME hand? There's poor scriptwriting and then there's this. If you enjoy action/aventure, then it probably won't matter. But if you enjoy solid scriptwriting, you could find much better in this genre even. It was fast-paced and exciting, I'll give it that, but come on."
5,"Dino Andino got $100,000 to do that shot - money well spent","I adore surfing. Nothing tops the feeling of pulling into a wave and taking part in the constant battle against the inconstancy of the sea, and when you get the better of it, it's like riding pure nature. I loved the film for all the classical reasons -action, romance, script etc, but what made it a classic was that it showed surfing as it really is. The passion in Bodie's cry at the end when Utah handcuffs sums up the obsession you can get with surfing better than mere words; believe me, I know. Watching the film is a good start, but going out and doing it'll show you what I mean. It's a beautiful film."
2,I will NOT FALL,"I love this film, and I just recently picked up a PS3 to enjoy BLURAY movies and such. However due to the quality of (wink wink) digitally remastered transfers only HALF of the SMALL amount of films I want to watch on BR are worth seeing, this is NOT one of them sadly. This looks no better than the last DVD release. Ive seen MUCH older and cheaper made movies come out looking better on BR....me sad"
4,"Nice plot, so dont screw up the movie Swayze!","For some heavenly reason, this FBI/surfer movie lacked the need to list ""the rules"" of going undercover as most early 90's FBI, hitman, or criminal movie would do, instead, this movie takes on a more action role than a comedy role. For yet another great reason, this film turns and leads into a real climax after the main action scene, instead of slowing to a stop."
4,Definitely one of my favorites !,"Yes, some 90's movies can be hard to sit through now a days.... NOT THIS ONE. I have always enjoyed watching this movie. Its a great plot, good action, and love the cast. How can you not like a movie with Reeves, Swayze, and Busey in it??!? The image of them in their president masks will always be very memorable. If you haven't seen it, watch it. And hell, right now its $7.99 for the movie on BLU-RAY. Amazing deal."
1,Thumbs down!!!,"Fox Home Video messed up again... Like they did with their European release of Point Break released a year ago. I am a huge Point Break fan and I know this movie by heart.. I know every detail. So when I bought the DVD I thought something was missing, so I dug out my old Point Break on VHS ( 4:3 format )... NOOOO !! WHAT HAVE THEY DONE !!! THOSE INCOMPETENT.... They had actually cut approx. 1/3 of the movie format by adding black lines to make it look like Wide screen enhanced... Again... Like they did with the European version. Do NOT buy this crap!!! If somebody at FOX reads this, Can I please have my money back?"
4,Cult Favorite,"I wanted to see an early Kathryn Bigelow. There are so many compelling parts of this film, it is easy to understand its cult status. The acting is the weakest part of it, except for Patrick Swayze who completely shines. I read that it is being redone."
1,I thought that this movie was the worst .,this movie dosen't show the true meaning of the sport of surfing..it was 1 of the worst surf want to be movies ever..
1,The Pitching Edge by Tom House,"House did not write this book for Little League coaches who want to help their kids. It is loaded with hyper-technical jargon that House does not explain and won't make sense to experienced players and coaches. For example, in a section on how to pitch off a mound, House states, ""A pitcher must find and keep an upper body spine-to-hip relationship with a constant angle of flex in posting knee at front leg lift, stride and landing -- directing upper body into torso rotation and launch of a baseball."" What? His science may be correct, but you won't benefit from this book because House does not translate the science into common sense terms that ballplayers will understand."
5,One of Gilliam's best movies!,"I thought Gilliam's previous movies were just eclectic and I didn't really get them, but ""The Fisher King"" really hit home for me. If you like a movie to have deeper dimensions and allusions than just the central storyline, then this one is for you. I would compare it to what I experienced when reading Shakespeare's works. There is usually a very straightforward story, but the delicious ""a-ha"" moments usually only occur after several reads and serious reflections.If you don't want depth in a movie, then this movie is fairly entertaining just to see Robin Williams (Parry) rub his toosh across the grass in Central park like you see dogs do from time to time. I've never seen that in a movie before. Not that I look for that, but it clearly demonstrates the sincerity and vulnerability of the characters portrayed.""The Fisher King"" is not for everyone, but I really like this movie."
4,Touched my soul,"While I'll agree that this movie might not be for everyone, I loved the story and bought the cassette and paperback years ago. I might just have to buy the movie now. Robin Williams has long been one of my favorite actors since he starred on Mork and Mindy. This is one of his best dramatic performances. You can feel Parry's pain and understand why he went mad. On a happier note, I liked the part where Parry and Jack were naked in Central Park. That should have sparked your curiosity enough to check out this movie. Not for everyone, but if you are a lover of fantasy, and a fan of Robin, check it out!"
2,"Uneven, cutesy in parts, Williams overacts again","Generally unbelievable film about a man's dissolution and redemption. Jeff Bridges does a magnificent job with the material; unfortunately, Robin Williams is miscast as a crazy person (who has gone crazy by an act that was precipitated by Jeff Bridges' character). Williams should have played his part with some degree of complexity, but all that comes out is tics and showiness. What a shame. The script is uneven, in parts very insightful and in other places simply stupid (the dinner with the four main characters is just awful). If a the movie and therefore the script had been shortened by 30 minutes, the movie would have been much better. As it is, the unbelievability overwhelms whatever good points the movie has. Too bad."
5,Beautiful....,A feast for the eyes and ears. A presentation which alters your perception of time and natural occurrances in one the most beautiful spots on earth.
5,Since By Man,I've seen them live and I think I died of happiness that night. I've never heard anything like them...and I do anything to see them live again. You are consumed and pulled in by their music and you forget all the bad and negative things that have been going on for awhile...buy the cd. It's definitly worth it
3,"How to reach customer service, program two-touch","To all those who buy a Northwestern Bell phone and find that nobody ever answers the VTC customer support line -- after much searching we found that you can reach an outfit called Unical, which sells these phones and offers the VTC support, at (626) 965-0218, in City of Industry, Cal.A nice lady there told us that people inquire all the time about how to program the two-touch numbers on the 76510. It's simple, but not mentioned in the manual. You don't use the M numbers at the top (they are just for the one-touch), you use the regular keypad numbers below.So I guess we'll keep it. It has all the other features we want, and I just hope it lasts longer than what some of the other reviewers said."
5,Great simple phone,"I love this phone, have three of them, easy to read, simple to use, can see caller ID easily. Have two on desks, one on the wall. They have worked for 9 months now."
3,the ligh shall set you free,"regurgitated new age channeling, belive it or not, I havent heard from the other world beings yet and I am very disappionted."
5,Life changer,"This book changed my view on the universe and its laws, very recommended if you are on a path of enlightment.."
1,You will NOT buy this book!,"This book has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the game (Magic the Gathering). The only thing that relates to the game that I could find in this book is the word 'mana'. But then again, you can find the word 'mana' in many other non-MtG books.I guess that the other people that gave this book a positive review are not Magic the Gathering players. This book is a total ripoff.If you want to buy this book anyway, make sure you read it BEFORE great MtG books such as Arena, The Thran, the Artifacts cycle's, etc. That way those books will only be greater!"
5,Excellent! I feel this was one of John Wayne's best films.,This film has the excitement of putting out oil fires. Added to two classic love stories. I have always enjoyed this film and now my 15 year old son is enjoying it as well.
3,Constant cloging problems,"The windway of this instrument is quite narrow. So, saliva from your mouth will always clog it. Moreover, the breath pressure you should apply to this instrument is so marginal, so low that at begining you won't be able to produce nice sound on this recorder. Maybe try plastic Aulos, the ones I tried don't have clogging problems and they are more tolerable of regular breath pressure. Better yet buy yourserf wooden Moeck recorder."
2,Plastic sounds like plastic,"I have to disagree with the other reviewers; this recorder sounds like a plastic recorder. I bought one, and then compared it with a wooden Kung recorder, which only cost about $100 more, and there is no comparison.Considering how much time I put into playing, its easily worth the extra dough for a low end quality recorder, kung, moeck, etc. Try Lazar baroque recorders online; he lets you try a couple and send one back."
5,America's Top Ten,"Life is competitive, right? This is an engrossing book that really helps explain why Eleanor Roosevelt ranks #1,Abigail Adams #2, Dolley Madison #3, Jackie O #4, Hillary #5, Rosalynn Carter #6, Lady Bird Johnson #7, Betty Ford #8, Edith Roosevelt #9, and Sarah Polk #10. Find out why Laura Bush is only #24!This book dishes lots of embarrassing details passed over by other more flattering accounts of first ladies. Don't be bothered by hisotorical nit-pickers who can't see the forest for the trees -- this isn't an encylopedia, it's a way to measure first ladies. You'll never think of them in old-fashioned stereotypes again after reading this book."
5,First Ladies Fanatic,"I'm a fanatic for books on first ladies. I found out about this book when I saw the author's television interview on John McLaughlin's show, One on One. After reading it, I can't believe I hadn't heard about this before! What a great exploration of how women have been White House partners. There are also lots of juicy scandals and some truly bizarre behaviors glossed over in other books. This is must reading for any fan of first ladies!"
5,Great Start to ASP,ASP for Dummies was the first computer book I ever read cover to cover. I learned to do use ASP efectively with this book in less than a week!The exapmple code in the book is well written and easily portable.This book was so cool that it forced me to buy weebspace on a decent server so that I could share my ASP Pages with the world in less than a month.
5,Buy it Today,"Read most of the book, helped me a great deal, worth every penny (considering the company payed for it). If your a beginner in asp or want to know more about server side scripting, buy this book today."
1,for dummies is right,"I just read some of the positive reviews and I cant believe it! This book is so vague and so spotty, that it cannot be relied on at all. And on top of that, the paddy-cake paddy-cake language is downright obnoxious!!If you want to be able to actually do something, then I would go to the wrox programmer to programmer series specifically the professional active server pages 3.0."
2,No Table of Contents,"Do not buy this version of Spoon River. The material is great, but this particular edition lacks a table of contents or index, so finding a specific character's monologue is tedious and annoying. Also, I'm not sure of any others, but this edition does not include Dippold the Optician."
5,The story of America by Americans of all kinds,"A classic of American literature, it tells the story of the America I grew up in, the one that still exists and thrives."
3,Ok But there is a New Adaptation which is Better,"This adaptation of Spoon River Anthology has been around for almost 50 years. It is kind of boring. It is too long. There is finally a new adaptation for the stage which, in my opinion, is better than this one. It is much more assessable to High School students, College Students and even Adults. It is called The Spoon River Project."
5,Comedy at its best,"No real plot, no real emotion just scene after scene of hilarious stupid humor, just the way a movie should be made.""Ah! I lost my cap! Swing around and we'll pick it up"" ""We're on the mission sir"" ""Ah, good thinking. Put Rubertawitz down in a life raft to mark the spot."" ""We could be out here for days sir"" ""Then put some food on the raft! Do I have to think of everything. We'll tape all his favorite show, he won't miss anything. Fine, how am I suppose to be an Admiral without my cap. It's out there all alone, and I'm here powerless to do anything about it."""
3,Disappointing,This book reviews in detail how mental illness has been evolving over the years. There is minimal attention given to causes or ideas about what is leading to the increase in cases of mental illness until the very end of the book and then it is a cursory list without much discussion.I found it most disappointing.
4,GREAT!!!!!!,"VERY WELL WRAPPED, PLAYS REALLY GOOD, MY HUSBAND BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS. THIS ITEM CAME QUICKLY. THIS CAME AS DESCRIBED. WOULD BY FROM YOU AGAIN THANKS."
4,this was a must have,"This book had been in our family since I was old enugh to know what a cook book was. As the years passed- it was used by all, some pages more than others, and I wanted a copy for my own home. It has all the classics, and keeps the memories alive. Its so much more than a cookie book."
5,An old favorite coming back!,"I've had a copy of the original Betty Crocker's Cooky Book, 3rd printing since 1966. I use it almost exclusively when baking cookies - it has all the favorites we grew up with! Pictures of each cookie are included and all recipes are fast and easy. An exact copy (same printing) went for big $$ on e-Bay. I wouldn't trade mine for anything. I highly recommend this cookbook to all cookie lovers, especially now when it's back in print and you can get your own new ""original."""
5,The book YOUR Grandmother learned to bake cookies from!,"That is how I introduced my granddaughter to this new & less ragged copy of my beloved Betty Crocker's Cooky Book! There are no ""hard"" recipes here, very little ""artificial"" and all of it good. A wonderful way to share some fun with the kids while eliminating all the ""junk."""
5,For cookie monsters,"I originally bought this book as a gift for my mother. I thought she would enjoy it's charm and it's old fashion recipes. then before christmas I went over to write down a few recipes to bake for christmas. I could have been there for days! they all looked simple and good so I bought myself a copy also. after trying several of the recipes I have found that they are mostly simple and delicious. It seems that no matter what combination of ingredients I have in the house when the mood hits I can usually find a recipe to make. Great book ! and my kids love the pictures ,and the cookies too of course!"
1,"Oh,Lordy....","Im sorry, but, if you ""pre-teens"" want the independence you crave so much,- you have to earn your parents respect. By listening to THIS, youre lessening your chance of ever getting there. Im mean, come on! You can tell that these poor kids don't even want to be doing this! Pft!-""Dream Street"". I wonder how long it took them to think of THAT name. No wonder these ""boy-bands"" are losing the popularity they once had to artist who can atleast WRITE THIER OWN SONGS.-*"
2,They sounded better in their debut,"As you grow up, your voices mature. They are suppose to get better. This did not work for Dream Street, unfortunately. Their debut is so much better, even though Jesse was what, 14 and sounding as Aaron Carter did when he was 11. I think it's highly unnecessary for a soundtrack, just because they are in the movie, to have 65% of the songs theirs. The only songs I really liked on this is ""I Say Yeah"" (which is, again, WAY better w/ the original version) and ""I'm Gonna Make You Love Me"", even though I dislike Play, I thought the song was pretty cute and Chris added a nice 'flair' to it."
2,"cute pictures, bad messages","I was looking for a breed specific book, this is mainly a book on puppies in general, with a few specifics, and many pictures if ig's.I was VERY disapointed that there was no mention at all of rescue dogs, and the author recomended a puppy over adults because you can train them how you want them. It was very pro breeder overall. The main reason there are so many wonderful dogs in rescue , is that breeders pop out many pups to make money, but never educate people on the specific needs of these dogs.If you are looking for an ig book, go elsewhere. If you want a book on how to train your puppy to sit and stay, and look at some cute pictures of iggy's , then , maybe you'll like it."
4,IG book,"This was probably the first book we read before getting our IG, and we found it very helpful. If you talk to a responsible breeder about IG's, they should tell you what you need to know about them. Also, one search on the internet and it will bring up the IGCA. We have several books related to IG's and this book is just fine. IG's definitely aren't the breed for everyone. And they aren't very hard to potty train, you just have to be willing to teach them."
