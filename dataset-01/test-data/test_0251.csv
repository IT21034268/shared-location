1,Why did I buy this CD?,"Let me count the ways -- 1) See Spot Run would make for better lyrics than All Cheerleaders Die. 2) No basses, means no homeruns. 3)I worry when bands hire image consultants at the supermarket. 4)If your not good enough for my brothers bar-mitzvah-- you not makin it to the charts."
4,Cool Helmet Cover,Shipped and received within 5 days. This little helmet goes great with my new football head cover.
3,A PLEASANT READ,"A PRETTY DECENT READ. A REAL PAGE-TURNER. TAKE A LITTLE OF """"ALIENS"""" AND ADD A DASH OF""""INV. OF THE BODY SNATCHERS"""" AND A SKOSH OF """"THE RIGHT STUFF"""" AND SOME """"ANDROMEDASTRAIN"""" TO TOP IT OFF AND YOU HAVE A FUN THREE DAY READ. MEDICAL, TECHNO AND SCIENTIFICJUNKIES WILL RELISH THIS NOVEL."
4,4+.. Great Read!!!,"I avoided this book for the longest time. After reading all of Gerritsen's other books, this one didn't interest me. Im not into space/science fiction stories. My mom read it and loved it. So... I tried it. I should have known Gerritsen could envelope me in the story. It was soooo interesting, and believable. I really enjoyed this book afterall. It had an eerie feeling to it. Definitely highly recommended."
2,Great cover masks mediocre book,"I love science and modern medicine thrillers (as opposed to science fiction) and anticipated something rather special with this book: something well written, intelligent and original. Sadly, I was disappointed. GRAVITY has some good detail and a plot that basically works, but the writing was surprisingly flat and unintelligent. Above all, I felt the story lacked a clever or original premise - which for me is the main thing. Good new ideas are obviously in very short supply. But what a cover!"
5,Best Jewel Cases out there,"These are the best jewel cases that I have found. They don't break like the regular jewel cases, which are very brittle, and these are easier to open. I've been using these for years to ship CD's to my software customers. I have yet to have a CD show up damaged."
1,Terrible,Just a lousy example of soft core. Save your money but more importantly save your time. There is no reason in the world to rent or buy.
5,Book review,"Purchased book(s) for manufacturing company: COO, Director of Manufacturing, and VP of Engineering. They have found it helpful."
2,less than impressive,"having seen the genius of ravi shankar unleashed upon a spell ridden crowd, (see Monterey pop, and others), the ensuing energy released causes an instant sense of unity, and a feeling of having witnessed/participated in something altogether extraordinary. I once saw him recieve a standing ovation after spending six or seven minutes tuning his instrument. he seems to have abandoned his focus on this outing. at one point he actually seems to be briefly running sitar blues riffs...eh???"
5,"inexpensive, and very, very, good non-stick",I was pleasantly surprised when I received this pan. This is the unstickiest piece of cookware I have ever owned. Even I could flip crepes into the air with a flick of the wrist! Crepes are fun to make and so yummy. My picky 8 year old brother ate all that I could make and asked for more!
5,Great Sign!,This sign is much better than I anticipated. The picture doesn't do it justice. The metal is heavy and it resembles a real street sign!! The graphic and painting are fab!! My father loves this sign!!
3,Bernard Leach: Life and Work,"Whilst not being criticla of by Cooper's book considerable caution needs to be taken with a statement such as Bernard Leach being the father of studio pottery as many predated him, with just a few beingBernard Palissy 1509-1590Ernest Chaplet 1835-1909Auguste Delaherche 1857-1940Martin Brothers 1873-1923Fishley family from early 1800sWilliam Moorcroft 1873-1945William and Edward Taylor, at in Pottery in late 1890sCharles Vyse 1882 - 1971"
4,"Handy, excellent value","I am a college student who depends on these pens entirely for well-organized, understandable notes in all my subjects, and I find them invaluable. I prefer the orange barrel (fine point) and appreciate the freedom of customizing the four colors in the barrel with trade-offs between the designer-color model (turquoise, green, pink, purple). For an inexpensive pen, most colors write very well and the barrel is comfortable enough for extended use, although I find the purple ink from the designer line bleeds through my notebook paper over time (the four colors in the original lineup do not). In all a good pen and a great value, and handy little tool for those of us who have alot of information to learn, access, and organize."
3,Hard to write,"If you like pens that ""glide"", then don't get this pen. The tip of this pen pushes in every time you apply pressure to write. This makes it hard to write and makes my handwriting look weird. This is a problem to me especially, because my handwriting is kind of messy already. My handwriting + this pen = a page of scribbles that requires a hieroglyph expert to decipher. However, if you got good handwriting, or if you don't mind a pen tip that pushes in, then this is the pen for you!Also, the blue and white color makes the pen look kind of childish. This doesn't really hinder its functionality, but it's just something to be aware of, if you care.My advice: Look for another pen if you want a ""smooth"" writing experience."
5,Painting is alive !,"Excellent book, is a MUST, unbelievable artist, is a response to many people that surrender instead of confronting life problems, he simply takes this raw material to create ART, and he does it in a way only comparable with greatest of old times : Rembrandt, Vel√°zquez & Caravaggio.Photographs are amazing, the price is just a low contribution to what I have got buying the bookA modern figurative painter should buy it immediately !!!Vincent Desiderio is undoubtedly a great master of our age, sorry : of our culture, time does not matter in this assertion"
2,Too small and thin fabric,"I should've paid more attention to the dimensions. I was hoping to use these blankets for swaddling but they're too small and too thin. The fabric is a little cheap.. but hey, this is a cheap buy. I ended up using the blankets to tuck the baby's arms underneath her, and then use something else for swaddling."
3,Too small,"I Bought this for my baby before she born and I could not wrap her very well, for the blanket size. I just liked the color, and it was cause i pick up the right color."
2,No flavor,"Green Tea Pomegranate smells heavenly when you make it, but it will taste bland no matter how long you steep the tea bag."
5,comfortable classy chair,I bought this chair for my psychotherapy office for clients to sit in (I already have a nice chair). It is comfortable and classy and a very good value. Highly recommended.
3,Chemise is not flattering,"I purchased this set as a surprise for my husband. I gave it 3 stars because, the robe is great but, the chemise is not flattering at all. It shows every single curve you have and bunches up in the back, especially if it is too large for you and creates a much ""larger"" body frame. This is my personal opinion on this product. I have given away the chemise and kept the robe. I do not rec. this item unless you have a beautiful figure and if you are looking for a new robe."
1,robe and nightie,"I was not happy with the material of this product. I like the robe, tho, so for the price I kept both colrs,(red and black)I am not a ""return "" type person."
3,"Nice robe, bad babydall","The robe was very nice and a good size for my girlfriend. The babydoll was a bust. it seems poorly constructed and was way to big for its size. there was no structure to it, it was just like a big peice of cloth. we are not too upset because be were just looking for the robe and that babydall was a plus. But we were very happy with the robe and would suggest the robe to anyone."
5,"Good, put not as good as Godzilla 2000",This book was well written and had an interesting plot with world super powers building giant robots. The main problem was that godzilla was not envolved enough except in the final battle. Despite this i think it was an excellent novel and would be enjoyed by any godzilla fan.
4,Janis ROCKS!,"If you lived in Canada in the early 1970's, then this incredible behind-the-scenes docuconcert will be very much appreciated. From the old Exhibition Stadium in Toronto, to Saskatoon and Calgary, the memories will come flooding back.The sound and video quality is extremely well preserved.Keeping in mind that this 3 day trip happened over the Canada Day holiday weekend in 1970, Janis died on October 4th of that year. Janis shows off her awesome talent while touring with the Grateful Dead, The Band and others. I highly recommend this dvd for anyone who remembers what it was like to be a Canadian hippy in 1970."
2,Not enough music,Way too much time was spent on the issue of the people who thought the concerts should have been free. DVD contains mostly interviews and few performances. Not worth the money.
5,"A,mazing","Festival Express is one of the greatest music movies I have ever seen. It is up there with The Last Waltz and A Hard Days Night. It is an amazing documentary about the wild train trip across Canada taken by members of The Band, The Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, etc... My friends and I saw it its opening night in Rochester and absoutly loved it. We sat in the back row and sang along to songs like ""Casey Jones"" and ""I Shall be Released"". It the perfect movie if you are looking for ""footage"" of Rick Danko, Janis, and Jerry Garcia since the majority of scenes offstage evolve around those three. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone and I cant wait to order it for myself!"
3,"Long ago, and far away! 3 1/2 stars!!","I bought this as a ""set"" with the Tom Dowd DVD. I wanted it because, I love the era (60's), I love the music (rock), and most of all I miss the artists, and I am sad that very few ""carried the torch"" and kept rock alive.I personally liked the train scenes the best, the parties, the jams, the artists off the stage. Its far from perfect (from my understanding, this was shelfed for years), but it does give a glimpse, a time capsule, see Jerry Garcia, Pig Pen, Janis, Richard Manuel, Rick Danko, and others who are are long gone, just like the wonderful music they played"
1,Not the right region code so I'm unable to watch it,Probably a pretty good DVD if I could watch it. It won't work on any of my DVD or Blu Ray players because it says it's the wrong region code. . .
5,Janis steals the show!,I never got to see Janis and now I wish I could go back in time so I could see her perform live! She is amazing!
4,Almost Perfect,"Lisa Belkin has done a good job relating the behavior of the sample of doctors she selected.For those not in the medical profession, it is heart warming to think that doctors ""care"", and have emotions just like most humans do.From my first hand experience in the medical industry, I would also have liked to read about those doctors who behave quite differently. The ones who ridicule patients, make ribald comments about anesthetized women on the operating table, and who treat their work like an hourly paid worker.Perhaps her sequel would give a more balanced view of this honorable profession which has unfortunately, in the past decade or two, seen a decline in the high standards it once met."
5,Great Product,"I love the Nature's Gate Roll-On Deodorants. Great smell, does not break out my skin like others. Highly recommended."
3,It's ok,"Smells too fruity for a man to use confidently. Needs to cover every spot of the armpit in order to work effectively. Is better at covering odor than at preventing it. Due to the fruity/flowery smell and its coverage issues, seems better suited for women, especially with their shaven armpits."
4,Just Dandy,"Overall, a good product. It has a fresh scent which reminds me of Irish Spring soap. I did find that this deodorant did not work as long as your typical store brand, but it is good for 12-15 hours (probably less if you're exercising.)"
1,Natural,It's ok looking for a more sustainable one has a musty scent almost looking for something with better scent because Iam active a lot
2,"Love the smell, but it doesn't last for crap!","Unlike another reviewer, I actually love the smell of this deodorant. However, the effectiveness is just plain awful. Under normal usage, I'm lucky if I go half the day before it's like I'm wearing nothing at all. I can't even go an entire work day without it wearing off. That's terrible. I've used Axe or Right Guard for the past 12 years or so, and they provide 24 hour protection, so I haven't smelled my armpits since I was in my teens! I honestly think this stuff might have ingredients in it that CAUSE your armpits to smell! I never, ever stink or smell, but after wearing this stuff, I smell like pure B.O. at the end of every single work day. It's incredible. This stuff is garbage! Back to Axe I go!"
4,seeems to work so far,"I have one year old twin boys who discovered that they can watch Baby Einstein any time they want by pressing the right button on the tv. They have watched me do it many times, and caught on quick. Now that I use the tv guard, they have ignored the buttons. although the first day that I put the guard on, there were a few frustrated screams, but after that they don't even bother to notice. Now the only problem is that they steal the remote. I recommend it to any parents of children who aren't little terrors that are going to rip the guard off, or break it in half."
4,I was brought up on the movie....,"To me Indiana Jones is Harrison Ford, brown leather, and fedora.When reading the book, i kept replaying the movie in my head of that scene.Nevertheless, reading this book, I do recommend. It'll fill in gaps that the movie missed, and like all books will paint a much bigger picture that does a movie."
5,Exciting page-turner.,"This is such a good example of how unwise it is to pre-judge a person until you really know them. There are many people in this book who deserve a waiting period before passing judgment on him/her. Also, I found this book satisfying inasmuch as there was NO profanity, no sex, no activities I would not want the teenagers in my family to read. I loved it - and found it very exciting."
5,Spellbinding,"I was skeptical at first reading a book by a first time writer, but then, all writers have to start somewhere.From the first page until the last page, Ken Merrell holds you captive to his book. I love books where the plots twist and turn; First you think one thing, then another. This book has it all!I can almost see James Patterson writing a book like this.Can't wait for the next one, Ken."
5,Lets make this book a Discovery channel show!,I can't believe the discovery channel or TLC hasn't done a special on this book. It would be one of the greatest shows they've done. Lets email them to get a show on this book!
5,Technology of the past still hidden from mainstream research,"Great book from a fresh perspective on the technology of the distant past. Mr. Dunn shows us the evidence of advanced construction and machining techniques used to construct the largest building ""man"" (I hope so) has ever built. The establishment will have you believe this pyramid is a tomb to project one mans ego into the eons. Mr. Dunn shows us instead this monument was built for a more universal purpose of generating power. What that power was used for is perhaps an even greater mystery."
2,Looks Good but very hard leather,"The product looks good, however, it was not right size for my Motorolla Rizer Z3. The leather is very stiff. The vendor gladly took the return and refunded full amount."
3,Ok,"I haven't broken in the shoes, but so far they are narrow at ball contact. The shoe of course looks wonderful and classic. The leather inside gives a good fit, but for some reason I don't have a nice feel of the ball as I did with my old predators."
2,Overpriced for calf skin,"They try to boast that this calf skin is comparable to kangaroo leather...It's not. The feel on the ball is soft, but when you strike the ball, it isn't even close. I love adidas and bought 4 pairs of Profi's before they were discontinued. At the same price, these just don't cut it. Stick with the copa's, at $90, they may wear out a quicker, but a seasoned player can tell the difference. On the plus side, I do like the traxion."
1,not happy,"First off, I bought this product because you market it like it is going to be a live DVD of the concert we just went and saw in Vancouver as we purchsed the tickets over the internet. That is false advertising. Second I pay the rush delivery so I can get it before Xmas thinking this was the exact DVD we just saw in concert live when I could have just saved the money and ordered it anywhere.."
2,"How the hell can ""Prayer"" be left out?",I don't understand how they could leave out Living On A Prayer! That's a MUST for a Bon Jovi concert!! I am totally appalled!!
1,"Very confusing, bad for beginers","I would like to know if there are any books that beside this book so that I can learn Illustrator. In particular, Using the Pen tool or other features. That's right, so I can learn and understand more about the topic and get well prepared for a career in design and graphics.I am wondering if this is possible, I'd like to learn about Illustrator ASAP.Thank you very much for your time and help.If you are reviewing other Illustrator books, please inform if they will be able to help. So far, this one and two others have been of no good to me."
4,Very Nice Jewel Case,An elegant but simple design. I reserve using the 5th star only because I've just started using these and the longevity factor isn't there yet. What I can say is that they have an ingenious method of enclosing/extracting the disc on a locking hub;the disc does not spin while in the case. Best DVD(CD) after-market case I've come across!
2,They are slim....and warped.,"I have had these out of the package for less than 5 minutes and already on here to write a review (and after a decade with Amazon and very, very few reviews, that means something...only when total crap would I waste my time writing a review to serve as a warning to others).Put simply, these are going back - pure warped junk. They close in the center with a little bubble and none of the corners seal shut. Moreover, the soft plastic cases are all warped a little and don't sit perfectly flat/square. Cheap, Chinese junk, not that I expected much more...but they offer little if any protection and are just cheaply made.I could value the stack sitting here about to go back at $7.95, tops."
2,Seachem is great for filtration.,"This stuff is awesome for your fish tank and provides some of the best filtration on the market, but it tastes horrible. When I put it on my cookies it had a very bad flavor similar to melted plastic. The bottle is excellent for snuggling up against and its got a big wide hole that's nice too."
3,Fixin' the misconceptions of DB.,"Hi, I'm a big fan of Dragonball, but what a lot of people don't understand is that Dragonball and Dragonball Z are two diffrent series. Dragonball is an adaption of the chinese book ""Journey to the West,"" and stars the monkey boy Son Goku. It is a comedy adventure series with a little action. DBZ on the other hand is the story of the Goku's family. It is an action series with a little adventure and comedy. They are both very good however, but may not be everyones cup of tea. On a side note, try and get the uncut version of the anime, the cut versions are horribly butchered and look silly. Thaks for letting me rant. Your quite sad if you've read this far. To regain your life read a book (""Journey West"" is a good start) ^_^0"
1,"Not Bad Good, Just Bad Bad.","I'm not a huge Dragonball fan, but I am a huge fan of outlandish films, especially those from the far east, so I bought this film hoping to get a lot of good laughs at it's expense. What actually happened was me groaning a lot, and wondering just what the heck was supposed to be going on in this stinker, as I dozed off again and again. The plot is so threadbare that it's about as developed as an Power Rangers episode, and the martial arts are along the same caliber. The special effects are laughable at best (couldn't they do better than that rubber crocodile?) and the dubbing is just plain pathetic. I can't recommed this film to anyone, except people who enjoy suffering through absolute dreck. I would've given it no stars if it were possible."
2,this movie SUCKS for dbz fans!,"this movie SUCKS! but i WILL give credit for the actual stage fighting! they showed they could actually fight, the fights dont look too fake. But if you are a dragonballz fan, like me this movie is STUPID! they tried to mix in dragonball with dragonball z and turned out stupid. when monkey boy (goku in the real version) flies it looks soo fake! and since when did sayjin's have CURLY hair? yuk! they have SPIKED hair! and goku used the magic cloud cuz he couldn't fly, and when he could fly, he didnt need the magic, the candy cloud anymore! anyways... they didn't even do a KAMEHAMEHA! and thats the dragonball main move! and ALSO! they don't even go super sayjin! and TOO, they couldn't even get the damn names right! the movie looks sooo fake! so basically... this movie is WACK! and would be worth about a penny to a dragon ball, dragonball z or dragonball gt fan."
2,Cats overpower Panic Mouse,"Even with the stablizing bar in place my Siamese overpowered the Panic Mouse within 10 minutes and sent it tumbling down a flight of stairs, bending the arm, impacting it's functionality (now limited). The thing sucks batteries four times as fast as the last moving toy I purchased. Medioce at best; poor if you have an ""assertive"" feline when it comes to hunting."
4,Cute movie for girls,"This is the type of movie you watch during a slumber party. Girls will watch it, and a few moms too. The story and message are very good, acting is o.k. If you have a preteen or teenage girl you probably already have this in your DVD collection, recommended."
4,Bad acting offset by catchy songs and a warm story,"My son can't stop watching the movie (he's seen it 20+ times in less than a month); he sings the songs from the movie constantly. Although the acting is really bad, the movie does have a warm story."
3,h20,it was a good movie. You can easily tell its for younger children by the one girls acting but it was very cute. the ending was adorable
4,Liked it when I was a young teen,This movie is super cute for young teenagers. I recently watched it again because I saw it years ago and while my tastes have obviously changed I still thing it is a cute movie
1,had to try it,"was curious about the product from what i have seen others write, unfortunately the product is mostly a waste of time and money, didnt do anything, no real change after taking the product, the usual hype for a herbal product claiming to do wonders but not the case here, seek other remedies for what this product claims to help with because it will not accomplish what you seek, a lesson learned for me , but was less than 30 dollars so not the most expensive lesson i have learned, i would not buy this product again based on my experience with it , but you need to make your own decision."
3,One of packages slit,"Upon arrival, one of the packages was slit with little teff seeds everywhere and no return option for this item!"
1,Waste of Money,This book was useless for me. Very dated. Hit very few topics that were helpful for a beginner. Look elsewhere.
2,Not enough TMNT,"This is the second volume of the new TMNT series. A lot of plot points are introduced in these three episodes, including the Turtles' first encounter with vigilante Casey Jones, their discovery of some interesting secrets concerning their new lair, the construction of their Battle Shell assault vehicle, and the introduction of the mystical Sword of Tengu. The Turtles also encounter a microscopic robot known as the Nano, which leads to an above-average filler adventure. If you're a Turtles' fan, these episodes are essential viewing.However, see if you can either rent this DVD or catch the re-runs on TV. 3 episodes a disc is a blatant rip-off. WB puts at least 4 episodes on its Batman/Justice League DVDs. Those are bad enough, but 3 is inexcusable. As much as I love the Turtles, I'm not wasting my money on these DVDs.TMNT is a quality cartoon series. This DVD is not."
5,tmnt volume 2,i have seen the series i love it its new and has darker story line to each charcter rapheale has and edge and michaleangelo is actually funny in this series unlike the first turtles series can anyone tell me the differnace between this version and the uncut version of this dvd ive seen selling on ebay.?
5,CHROME WIRE FRUIT BOWL,THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT. IT CAN HOLD A LOT OF FRUIT AND IS VERY STURDY.FAST SHIPMENT AND GOOD CONDITION.
5,Fruit anyone?,"Good day! This is a great fruit basket. I received this really quickly and it is huge compared to the size I pictured in my mind. You can easily fit about 10 apples in the bottom, good sized, and still have room for the bananas to hang. It also helps to keep fresh fruit. I have apples that have been in there for a week or two that are just as fresh as when I brought them home. Even if you have to pay shipping, trust me, this product is worth every cent!"
4,Cool Banana Hook!,I bought this because I thought it was unique and it does look great. Can tip over easily however. Otherwise wonderful!
5,Chrome Wire Fruit Bowl,"This is a great product and it is HUGE! So beware if you barely have counter space. First I was worried about the gaps, but this bowl is for fruit that do not shed. So far it works great. By the time we received it my 3 year old ate most of the bananas, so I ended up putting tomatoes on the hook that were still on the vine. It worked perfectly, of course. Buy this item!"
1,Cheap product!,"This item broke within a matter of weeks! It might look nice and sturdy, but its not. Its cheaply made and cannot withstand more than a few bananas at a time. The glue on the basket section did not hold for very long.I tried to contact the seller multiple times but never got any response! Very frustrating!!Don't buy this product because even if it breaks, the seller does not respond to contact."
3,Wrong dimensions,"Cute shelf but the dimensions are completely wrong on Amazon. The shelf I received is 19""L 7""H 4""W. Haven't decided whether I'm going to keep it yet. However, I will say that it was packaged very well and e shelf arrived with no damage. I'm investigating with amazon to see if they shipped me the wrong item or if the dimensions on the website are incorrect.Update 8/1/12:I ordered another shelf just to see if I could get one that matched the listed dimensions. Unfortunately the second shelf arrived the same size as my previous. The shelf matches the nursery decor so well I've decided to keep one. Just know before you order, the shelf is smaller than the listing information lists."
4,Adorable shelf,"This shelf is good quality and very cute. It looks great in our daughters room. My only complaint is that it was difficult to hang. It's also very shallow, just deep enough for a picture frame but not so good for books or larger items."
4,"A Minor Crispin, But Still Fun","It is necessary to understand that Edmund Crispin was the pen name of Robert Bruce Montgomery, a scholar of English, organist, science fiction writer and anthologist, teacher, and film score composer. His books are in the tradition of J.I.M. Stuart, an Oxford don who wrote under the name Michael Innes -- literary, erudite, and mischevious. This one is primarily an intellectual enterprise, though it does have some of the mad humor that fills his better works. I found the climactic scene too similar to part of his Frequent Hearses for comfort, and he tends to deal with his villians by having them die in a ball of fire, but we all have our faults.If you're looking for a quick and stylish Brrrrrritish Mystery, this is a pleasant read. But if you want Crispin at his best, I highly recommendThe Moving Toyshop (Classic Crime)orGlimpses of the Moon, his last full-length novel."
1,Durability Issues,We have a problem with the disk in the middle no longer working on 3 of our 6 phones-which makes this phone semi-useless.
1,selection wheel stops working,"After only a few months the round multi-selection button on the center of each handset stopped working. It makes it impossible to look through your address book or caller id. If the button on only one of our three handsets stopped working I probably would have not posted a review, but all three handsets stopped working properly. We are very disappointed that they wore out so quickly and will be replacing them with a different brand."
2,Bad Speakerphone,"I purchased this phone for our small business and we make a lot of calls using the speakerphone. We have another Uniden phone and have been happy with it, but the speakerphone on this unit for both the handset and base unit is not very loud for both sides of the call. Unfortunately there are very few cordless 2 line phones, but we will be returning this because of the issues with the speakerphone."
2,Great Promise But Didn't Deliver,"I purchased this system (with 7 handsets) about 2 years ago. I have a home business and a 2 line system that I could place handsets in office and house areas was a great hope. Handsets would not work in every area of the house. I tried placing the base unit in different areas but our Master BR unit usually would not ring when a call came. That can be important. But the most serious problem is that now the base unit gives me an E2 message and doesn't work. Uniden Support responded after my second email to say that E2 represented an ""internal issue with the unit"". They offered that the only recourse was to send the unit back for warranty work. Of course, they noted that the warranty is only good for 1 year from purchase. I will never take such a gamble with Uniden again. So, anybody out there want a good deal on 7 Uniden handsets?"
1,Uniden Unhelpful,I purchased this item for $99.99. The unit worked for about two months and then stopped working. The handset and the base will not connect. I contacted the customer service line and because I don't have my rec from Staples (I had to submit to get my money back and lord knows where it went after that!) they won't do anything for me. I was told I need to go out and purchase another one at my cost. Like I'm going to purchase another Uniden after this. I don't think so!
4,Good Value,"In reading the previous reviews, I was concerned using the phone with two lines - I use a conventional line for incoming calls and Voice over Internet Provider (VOIP via my Cable Modem). As it turns out, there was no cause for such concern. I simply set the default line to the Line 2 (VOIP) so all outgoing calls are automatically on the cheap line. Not that it was hard to chose lines a the top left button is Line 1 and the top right is Line 2. Overall, the only complain I had was the ring volume control - three settings (loud, half loud and off) and perhaps size - the hand sets are relatively small. Luckly the different ring tones are somewhat quieter. Overall they work well. I have four hand sets and they were really easy to set-up and use. I gave the product 4 stars only because of the ringer volume control."
1,Not a self study book,This book is for the class room (only) this is not for self study.A good book. But was a wast of my money. As i wanted a self study book.
2,disappointed,"I do not have the aboundance dinnerware. I was looking for various serving pieces to go with my solid colored dishes. I recently purchased these salt and pepper, the gravy boat and the creamer sugar of this pattern...I was sooooooooooo disappointed with the dullnes of the fruit. It looked washed out. I would never buy this pattern again."
3,3.5 Stars For This Romantica.,"This is My first Jaid Black romantica. It was really hot, but I was also a little disappointed after reading it.What bothered me most is the way JD treated Candy, which lacked respect and consideration. I don't think enforcing the heroine in the nude for several days and exposing her to other men while she's doing something intimate is romantic. Also the anal sex...that was a turn off to me. Over all a lot of lust but not so much love.I've tried her ""Tremors"" which was much better. Also hot and erotic but sweeter."
1,Waste of time and money,"Even though this ""book"" was only around 50 pages in pdf format, it was still a waste of time to read. There was no plot or backstory whatsoever."
2,these do not work for me,"i only used for 2-3 days, noticed only intestinal discomfort after taking. gassy & a weird bloated feeling. I discontinued use & my system went back to normal. Note, I have taken other brands of acidiph. in the past and had the same problem. Maybe it's just me???"
1,Didn't work for me.,"When I had some painful constipation recently, these Pearls didn't work at all to relieve any of the symptoms - or to keep the constipation away in the first place because, in fact, I was already taking the Pearls before this bout of constipation started. I was even taking 2 Pearls a day instead of the recommended 1 - but still no results. After I finish this box, I won't be ordering another one. I'm going to use a daily stool softener (200 mg/day per my doctor's advice) to try and keep regular instead."
4,A great yogurt substitute,"This product is great to take because you are not consuming any sugar, calories, etc. The tiny pills are so easy to swallow and they seem to work as good as yogurt...will have to take them awhile longer to see just how good they work...I know I will buy them again."
5,Changed my life!!,"Pearls have changed my life. I have been taking them a few months. I had been suffering from silent reflux which caused me to have swallowing problems. I had to take multiple prescription acid blockers. After only 2 weeks in pearls, I am off the medications and feel great. It has helped my irregularity, cleared my skin. Love this product!"
5,Great for prevention of yeast infections too!,"Since going off the birth control pill, I was a frequent sufferer of yeast infections. One of these pearls daily keeps me ""in balance"".It has also helped with my digestive regularity. I highly recommend this item!!"
2,Did not work for me,"I have suffered with IBS for many years and have not found a product that worked as well as Zelnorm. After reading the reviews I thought I would give Pearls a try... well after two weeks still no luck. I am now into my third week and still no results.I'm glad so many have found a product that helps with IBS, sadly this one is not for me."
1,Messed with my stomach,"I started taking these because the reviews were so great. Well it totally did not work for me. It did a number on my intestines and lets say made it very unpleasant. Some people can take certain things, some cant. I felt there was no difference in anything, just intestinal upset."
1,Isn't doing anything for me...,"I haven't been taking this product very long (about 1 week), but so far, it isn't working for me. I suffer from irregularity, constipation, and (embarrassingly) a flatulence problem. I was really hoping this would work since I am not a big fan of yogurt. Maybe it just doesn't contain enough probiotics, but I am afraid to take more than the recommended dose (1 pearl a day). I am going to continue taking the them until they run out, and will be sure to update my review if anything changes."
5,Best probiotic I've found,"These little pearls are great! They're so easy to swallow and the coating makes the probiotics last. They do take awhile to start working, but after about three and a half weeks, I started seeing improvement. Much easier to take than comparable products, and at least as effective. It's literally been a life changer in terms of what I can eat, I couldn't be happier."
5,Probotics rock,I first tried this product when a friend recommended to me after the success she had with it. I have IBS which causes me to suffer greatly with stomach issues and foods that cause irritation. After a month of taking this product my stomach problems have been reduced by 85%. I am now able to enjoy a meal without the constant concern over whether my stomach will tolerate what I am eating. I highly recommend this product. It doesn't solve all my issues you get suffering from IBS but it certainly has enable me to have a more normal lifestyle than I had prior to using this product. I love the fact that I can save money using the Super Savings Club and it is conveniently delivered to my door. Give it a try and see if it doesn't make a difference in your quality of life. It did mine.
2,"Bummer, doesn't work for me","As I said, doesn't seem to help me. Everything arrived on time and packaged well. Hope it works for you."
5,I liked it,very helpful for someone who has little previous knowledge of the subject. I needed a simple lead in and this provided.
3,Informative book on the men and the company behind the boats,"The history that made one of Americas most sucessful boat companies is excellent. The intrigues and negotiations leading up to the founder family parting with their company is great reading and the coverage of the early racing boats leaves little to be desired. The coverage of the massproduced boats is however less informative. The vast majority of the boats designed are only referred to with model name, available sizes and price ranges.All facts and figures are imbedded in the body text which makes the book impossible to use as a source of reference. Almost all pictures are overviews of one boat at the time. There are very few pictures highlighting unique or clever designs, and/or comparative pictures comparing various models and/or year classes."
4,Great for Yu-Gi-Oh fans,"My husband (yes, I said husband!) is an AVID Yu-Gi-Oh collector, as are our kids. I purchased this for them for Christmas, and if DVD's could get worn out, this would have done so LONG ago. I'm not a fan of the series, but judging by the looks of joy when the rest of my family watches these, they were an excellent buy. Plus, the show is not violent, and the ""monsters"" (cards) are ""WAY cooler than anything on Pokemon"" according to my family."
4,The New Breed: Systems for the Development of Your Own Creativity (Book With CD),This drum book gives a lot of different ideas. It starts out with easier pieces and continues to get harder as you go through the book. I have learned by using this book.The New Breed: Systems for the Development of Your Own Creativity (Book with CD)
5,Funnier than Lucky Jim by a factor of three.,"Amis has succeeded in making a hard-drinking, hard-drugging, and occasional date-rapist a profoundly sympathetic character. The more frequently the protagonist--if he can be called that--overdoses on pornography the more you ask your girlfriend to get up and get you a beer. Such is the state of the tail end of the 20th century, as Amis brilliantly conveys."
4,Gorgeous writing.,"Eloquent and heavy. A fine read. Didn't entirely grab me, but there were some absolutely gorgeously written passages, insights, and affecting scenes."
1,Why Pollute my Day!,"I honestly tried to read this snarkey and clever book. However, after laboring and then feeling like I was being dragged into the gutter, I decided life is too short for this. I quit - something I rarely do."
5,SOFT!!!,"These are the softest, tiniest, cutest little diapers ever. All of the other sizes are just as good. Wish they made Swaddlers in all sizes."
4,A good read for understanding the joy of whittling,"This was a very good, easy read for learning the techniques to whittling and the fun of creating things out of wood. Recommended to those interested in the joy and fun of wood carving."
2,Better books available,"I've read and collected quite a few books on whittling and carving. Some are good inspiration, some, historically interesting, and others teach ""how to"". this book fails on all counts.The directions are vague at best. The illustrations are of poor quality, and just add to the confusion.There are some good books out there, but this isn't one of them.If you want a book to start you out, tryThe Little Book of Whittling,by Chris Lubkemann.Happy Carving!"
5,Perfect for the youngest race fan,"I just received the Nascar toddler bedding set. It is for my 22 month old son. His dad races, so he loves anything to do with racing.This is the best bedding set that I have seen for little boys. The quality is great & actually the picture on the web doesn't really do this product justice. The coloring is just remarkable, this is really a high quality product."
5,Julian the last brilliant light of dying pagan Hellenism,"This is a delightfully enjoyable read as a novel.Equally valuable is the depiction of the Roman Imperial world shortly after Constantine, and Julian's attempt to revive syncretic pagan Hellenism as the official religion of the Empire.Julian, an intriguing Emperor, distinguished for his traditional virtue-- or to use the Greek word, arete-- who was also a potent warlord and administrator, philosopher-- in a way Julian was the last flourish of the dying Hellenic pagan world eclipsed by Christianity. The author illustrates, depicts, personalizes, and explores these reknowned aspects of Julian and almost magically recreates a living character out of the ink on the page."
5,My new favortie book.,"I like history, especially about the Roman Empire. I really ended up loving this book. It never gets boring, that's really something to say about a historical novel. I would like recommend this book to anyone, but, most likely, not everyone would enjoy it. It also has a lot to do with religion, which was surprisingly very interesting. I enjoyed every page of this book; the last two chapters are definitely page-turners! So, hopefully you purchase and read this book, it's totally worth it."
1,Connection was problematic,"When I connected this cable between my DVD player and my TV, it worked sporadically. The signal was intermittent, and sometimes did not work. I ended up replacing the HDMI cable with a component video cable."
3,Went back to component cables after using this,"Cables work fine, just didn't provide a ""clean picture."" Definitely added grain to the picture, while my component cables did not.if you bought this cable off the startech website, it would cost you 53 bones, so this is definitely a deal if you wanted to use it for an audio receiver. but the video playback is nicht so gut."
1,"Snap, crackle, pop!!","Plugged the cable into my cable box and Samsung 40"" LCD, and got nothing but crackling and popping noises, along with the video cutting in and out. I replaced the cable with another HDMI cable, and the problem went away. No doubt it was the cable. The price was right, but the quality was not."
1,Stay away,"I was also tempted by the low price of this cable. Plugged it in, saw little difference between it and my component cables. HDMI cable stopped working 12 HOURS LATER (sending garbage signal to the TV). Don't waste your money."
1,StarTech 15FT HDMI Cable - Don't waste your time,Don't waste your time ordering these cables. We plugged them in and then unplugged them to move the TV and the ends came off. Not worth sending them back - don't want to pay for shipping.The only place these are going is the garbage can!
5,I love this movie,I first saw this movie when I was around 16ish. I rented it because Christian Bale was in it. Anyhow I loved this movie sooo much. It was sad and the music in it was amazing. It inspired me to pick up swing dancing. The soundtrack is excellent too. I own it and if you don't have it you should really really buy it.
2,Before Batman and House,"An ok movie about young folks living in Hitler's Germany. It was interesting to see Leonard and Bale before they were so very well known. And yes, it is based on a true group of young Germans not accepting of the politicos who were in power then."
4,"A Good Movie, But The Ending Was Way Too Corny!","I saw this movie late last year, unfortunately I did not tape it. However, I purchased the movie from z-shops, the other week. It is a good film, with good acting performances all-round. It also managed to capture the atmosphere of 1939 Hamburg, under the National Socialist regime and showed how hard it was for the those amongst Germany`s youth who went against the prevailing Nazi flow. Because, make no mistake, the Hitler Youth membership accounted for 90% of German males aged between 14 and 18 years of age, by 1939. So, it would have been extremely hard for teenagers to resist the Nazi propaganda that was prevalent in all corners of 1939-German society. Swing Kids was all in all a good film, though the ending was far too corny for my tastes, been a 23 year old male. However, I would highly recommend it too anyone with an interest in those times, especially teenagers!"
3,THE THEME OF THE MOVIE IS TRUE,"When the Nazis came to power they outlawed jazz and swing music. (They also banned the foxtrot and the tango). Thus, listening to jazz and swing music became a way of protesting against the Nazis.Many Germans were fans of Ameican jazz and swing music and jazz and swing records were in high demand on the black market during the war.While the movie has many overly dramatic scenes, the basic theme is absolutely true as an investigation into the the Third Reich will reveal. Skeptics should read : Swing Under the Nazis"
3,good but not great,"This book definitely put some good perspective on living childless, and helps outline the emotional journey of making the decision to live a fulfilled life without children, but I felt it could have been better, and ended up wanting more from the book. I agree with a prior review that relating to these extraordinary, artistic people was sometimes difficult, and I feel many of them did make the decision to live a childless life for purely selfish reasons. I also felt the book suggested that most people who choose not to be parents are defective or incapable in some way, and are better off or more balanced without children. I personally disagree with that sentiment, and hope that most people who choose not to have children do so because they have made a rational decision to go in a different direction with their lives. Despite my negative comments the book was worth reading if you are trying to decide whether or not children are for you."
5,Why I keep reading this book,"Love, Acceptance, and Forgiveness changed the way I view church, ministry, and Christians as a whole. As a result of first reading this book ten years ago, and rereading it every year, I have discovered that people need unconditional love simply because they are humans.The key concept is simply that people need to be loved and deserved to be loved because they were created in the image of God.Acceptance should have nothing to do with stature or position, but simply with the fact that we are all humans.Forgiveness should flow freely without strings attached because we can all receive that same gift.I would encourage all people to read this book, embrace the concepts, and allow it to change the way you opperate as a person. In the simplest terms, in the most concise way to put it, it will challenge you to examine the way you view humanity."
2,Check With Simpletech before you buy (ditto!),"Like the previous reviewer, I purchased this and my motherboard could only detect 128M (half the memory). My motherboard takes 256M PC100 non-ECC unbuffered SDRAM, so I thought this would work.Simpletech has an easy-to-use compatibility calculator on their web site, so go there first and come back here to buy! I also found their instant-message based tech support speedy and helpful."
5,Cubic Zirconia Ring,Beautiful ring. One of the best rings I ever bought for the price..Definite buy..
1,Religious take on Tolkien,"Unfortunately, despite the title, there is no ""behind"" the movies at all. No background as to the making of or powerbrokering of the movies. Furthermore the book is infused with a whole lot of religious mumbo-jumbo - one lot of fairytales trying to compare itself to another lot of fairytales."
2,What about the rest of Europe?,"Interesting reading, as others have noted, but the author is shamelessly pro-British in his choice of stories to tell and his version of the stories he tells. Such jingoism does not belong in a book about the ""history of science."""
5,Floor Mat,This padded mat helped my wife stand without pain. The size makes it portable so it can be used in multiple locations.
5,ETTA JAMES IS ONE OF THE BEST R&B SINGER,"OF ALL TIMES ,THE SONGS ON THIS GREAT CD ARE W-O-M-A-N/NUMBER ONE /HAY HENNY.AND SO MUCH MORE TO HEAR . THE FRIST TIME I HEARD ETTA JAMES WAS ON THE CD AT LAST AND THE SONG WAS TOUGH MARY AND I KNEW I WAS HOOK ON ETTA JAMES , AND NOW IM A FAN OF ETTA JAMES AND THE BLUES . THANK YOU YOUR NEW FAN WIL JAMES HOLMES."
5,Wonderfully cozy,"This is one of the yummiest blankets my daughter has. It is very soft and cozy. We have had it for 9 months. We live in a warm climate, so it isn't used too much, so I don't know how it stands up to lots of washing. But it is working great so far for me."
5,"No Words Can Describe The Best Album Of All Time, But I Will Attempt","One day about two years ago I was cleaning my kitchen. Suddenly, XM's 'outlaw country' played the track ""Three Chiefs"".My life changed that day. I immediately purchased the album. It is almost the only album that I listen to anymore. I have since taken a boxtruck full of blankets and a Semi full of linens and furniture to Pine Ridge Concentration Camp. My awareness of this situation is 100% due to this album. If you read this and don't purchase this album, the only person you are hurting is yourself. I will leave the comments on the album alone. Suffice it to say, the album changed my life. If you listen to it, really LISTEN to it.. it should change yours as well. My life is filled with issues, and the native issue is now a major one of them. I am doing what I can to help that issue. I owe it all to Marty. Thank you Mr. Stuart, I can't express my thanks enough."
3,Not great with other bottle brands...,"I bought this sterilizer when I was using Avent bottles and it worked great. There is a place for everything...bottles, nipples, and caps. Our microwave is 1200 watts, so using this sterilizer saved me a ton of time...bottles were done in 3 minutes! However, when I had to switch to Dr. Brown's bottles, I was in for a shock. Apparently the Dr. Brown's bottles are just slightly taller than the Avent bottles, so they would not fit in this sterilizer standing up. I had to lay them down and pile everything on top of them. Its a shame because this is a great product, but I can't recommend it to people unless they know for sure they can use Avent bottles only."
4,a quick way to sterilize bottles and especially pump!,"i found that if i rinsed the bottles with cold water after they were sterilized, they dried much quicker. this sterilizer has worked well for me, but i don't know that i'd purchase it again, as i don't sterilize this terribly often. the dishwasher seems to work just fine."
5,My mother wishes she had had one!,"Bottles, nipples, pacifiers, etc. are sterilized in five easy minutes (time depends on your microwave), without my having to keep an eye on the stove. What else can I say!? Every new mom should have one!"
4,Quick and Easy,"This makes it quick and easy to sterilize. Four minutes in the microwave. Fits four bottles in the center and nipples, etc. around the outside. We use it daily. Works best with distilled water- less residue- but tap water is fine too."
5,Lifesaver,"This product was a life saver. I used it constantly, and I could not have gone through the bottle feeding months without it. I found this method much easier than boiling water."
2,Waste of Time!,"This sterlizer is just not worth the time. You are better off just boiling some water and throwing your bottles in there for a few minutes. For the money, its definitely not worth it and I wish I never registered for it."
5,Great product I didn't even think I would need!,"This is one product that delivers exactly what it promises. It works quickly and well.I have used it daily to sterilize not only my isis breast pump... but also a hospital grade rented pump, too. I am happy to say that neither of us has suffered from thrush or any infection.It's also wonderful for pacifiers and bottles. I use the avent bottles which fit perfectly... but also have mendela bottles that fit wonderfully, too.I would highly recommend."
1,need correct wattage,"I bought this item and realized that my microwave was 1500 watts and it is for 500-1100 wattage microwaves. I called and the rep told me i could use it with my wattage. Dont do it, it burned up my microwave somehow. Avent says this is not possible, but what a cooincidence."
2,I wouldn't bother.,"We found that this was a waste of money. It is just as easy for us to sterilize the old fashioned way. You can't fit all of the bottles you need sterilized in the steam sterilizer at the same time. Also, when you get the bottles out of the sterilizer, they are soaked with steam, meaning I had to wait a while for them to dry out and cool off. It may be useful for someone but not us."
3,Get the Novum Testamentum Graece et Latine,"Novum Testamentum Graece Et Latine - Greek/Latin New TestamentThis volume is excellent in what it is. Well-bound, clear print, etc. A basic edition of the Greek New Testament for the ages.But don't get this one. Get the Greek/Latin edition linked in, even if you don't care about the Latin (which you probably should). Get the Greek/Latin because the marginalia are superlatively helpful for study and cross-reference, almost as helpful as the text itself. Check the sample pages to see what I'm talking about."
5,reading is fun-damental,"Todd Parr's positive messages and cheerful artwork convey what is so great about reading (in case there are any doubting Thomases!) Rreading is an adventure, reading helps you learn new things, and ....you can read anywhere!"
2,like the price but,like the price but it ha no structure to it an just flops over with the tools in it.you would have to fill up the center with a bunch of stuff to actually get it to stay upright.
2,Save your money,Don't waste time on these ancient decks. Just save up for a solid direct drive turntable. the mixer is all but useless and the decks are garbage. I used these for about 30 minutes and then went out and bought some real turntables.
1,I had to force myself to finish this book,"I was searching for a new author and will obviously continue my search. Read other comments and you will get the message, he doesn't really understand us and how our system works. If you think that a hostage situation, as outlined in this book, could have the impact on decisions as it does in this book.... I say wake up and smell the coffee. I was waiting for this book to allow the President of the United States to become in harms way because of the 2 hostges held by the milita.As for the story as pure fiction, how much can one swallow? The ALERTs in this book are anything but... If some people think this is similar to Clancy's Rainbow Six team, they better reread the book. At every turn they make mistake after mistake and keep getting another chance."
2,"implausible, nerve grating","I found this movie's characters and plot too implausible and irritating to enjoy or find humor in this movie.I find it implausible that:1)At first glance Hepburn's character decided she wanted this guy and thus decided to ruin his life with her ridiculous tricks.2) He would be so gullible and/or weak as to continue to give in to her demands.3) He could even possibly fall in love with someone so selfish, controlling and manipulative.While I suppose these types and personalities do exist, what it boils down to is that personally, I can't stomach these types of characters and don't find deception and selfishness funny, nor the gullibility or willingness to submit to such a person entertaining."
4,One of my all-time favorites. Print quality not all that great.,"This is not a review of the movie, as this is not only one of my favorite comedies of all time, but one of AFI's top 100 movies of all time. There's no need add my two cents of opinion.However, as to the product itself, the print quality seems a bit of a disappointment. I had once read that the National Film Registry for Preservation had selected 'Bringing Up Baby' for preservation, which normally includes renewal of the master. I highly doubt that this is a print from such a master, despite the DVD set's ""remastered"" claim. Perhaps we'll just have to wait for a Blu-ray version.This set is actually very good, with featurettes on Howard Hawks, Cary Grant, etc. And it is, actually, the best print available on DVD at present."
5,Full tilt comedy and mayhem,"We loved this classic movie. We talked about it for days afterwards, recounting scenes and lines that were so clever and funny."
1,"Mindless, pointless, irritating...",Katharine Hepburn is extremely annoying in this movie. The plot seems to come from nowhere. Overall bad movie... it gets better toward the end though... still a VERY stupid movie.
5,The Music of the Spheres,"This is a beautiful, crisp, clear performance of Mahler's Eighth, with good liner notes. I used it to ""prepare"" for this year's opening concert at Tanglewood, with the BSO under James Levine. The live performance was awe-inspiring, but there were some parts [i.e., the finale] that built to a higher [and more satisfying] crescendo on this CD."
5,Quick and easy to use,"I'm not sure how I made it through having my first child without this. It's so quick and convenient to use. Works great for bottles, pacifiers, and breastpump attachments (even though I have an other than Avent brand breastpump). With my first daughter I used the dishwasher to clean her bottles which was not always convenient. When the dishwasher needed to be run and when I needed to wash bottles didn't always turn out to be the same times. This is also great for travel. I've had this sterilizer for 9 months and LOVE IT!"
2,Leaves condensation that lasts FOREVER!!,"At first we were thrilled to receive this sterilizer as a gift as we have twin girls and use A LOT of bottles but then we realized that after they were sterilized, they were left with condensation on the inside of the bottles and nipples. We thought that we needed to ""air them out"" for a short period to get rid of it; however to our dismay, letting them ""air out"" was not the solution. The only way the condensation clears up is if you have the bottles upright and not the on the rack, which to us seemed to defeat the purpose of them being ""sterile"" if we had to have them upright on the counter to get rid of the condensation. We have tried everything we could think of to ""fix"" this problem...but it continues to happen. We do not recommend this product at all and were VERY disappointed especially since it isn't cheap and our friend wasted thier money on this gift!! Two thumbs down!"
4,GOOD PRODUCT,"This is a good product and very easy to use. My only complaint is that the bottles come out really wet and it is a bit annoying, but I guess that is expected. I put less water sometimes, but they still come out soaked. Anyway, in general, it is something necessary and the automatic shut off is a big plus."
2,Not worth the money,"As a new mom I thought I had to have a sterilizer. I bought this one and used it only twice. After it runs, everything inside remains wet. If not promptly removed and dried, it's a breeding ground for bacteria. I then read in several books that sterilizing is no longer considered a must. Washing everything in hot, soapy water is much more efficient and cheaper!"
5,"Pure, unadulterated and unapologetic pop at its best!","I was a big fan of OMD from the release of ""Electricity"" and religously bought their new releases into the mid-80s. Unfortunately, with ""Dazzle Ships"" and ""Pacific Age"" I started to lose interest in the newer stuff and so I fell back on the early albums, which I still played a lot. I bought the ""Architecture and Morality"" DVD and heard a couple of good songs that I was not familiar with, notably ""Pandora's Box"". This made me buy the 'Sugar Tax"" CD (pity it does not seem to have been released on vinyl) and I am so glad that I did. It's a truly superb ""pop"" album, in the very best sense. Not as thoughtful or experimental as the early albums (""Stanlow"" anyone?)but great melodies and arrangements make this an album that stands up well in its own right. If, like me, you felt that OMD peaked with ""A&M"", get ""Sugar Tax"" and wallow in pure, unadulterated and unapologetic pop music at its best."
2,Disappointing and confusing,It started out ok. The title Wolfsbane got my interest and Harry was a good companion in the series but the ending was confusing and the eighth doctor doesn't really do much at all. Most eighth doctor books pretty much make him more human than a time lord. I wouldn't recommend it.
5,Pursuit of Holiness,This is most probably one of the best books I've ever read. It shows how you have to be Holy and can work towards it.
5,Best Of The Bosstones,"This is probably one of the best Bosstones albums next to or tied with Let's Face It. This has some good songs on it, maybe one filler song. Jackknife to a Swan is a very good opening song and 7 Ways to Sunday is an acoustic song, something new for the Bosstones. I don't think I've ever heard them do acoustic. Anyone can listen to it. My parents even ask me to play it sometimes so they can listen too it. Best songs: Jackknife to a Swan, Mr. Moran, You Gotta Go!, Everybody's Better, Sugar Free (my favorite),... outta luck, and Seven Ways to Sunday. Catchy Tunes! Buy it!!! I saw them at the Warped Tour and they are the best live band ever!"
5,Better than the previous 3 albums!!!,"In my opinion the last three Bosstones albums (Question The Answers, Let's Face It, Pay Attention) were great albums but not as good as their first three (Devil's Night Out, More Noise And Other Disturbances). Finally, the Bosstones have returned to their routes. This album is as loud as their first three and possibly consists of the best guitar riffs on a Bosstones album to date. I really miss the original guitarist (Nate Albert) but I'm glad to see that he has been replaced by a worthy guitarist (Lawrence Katz). Even if you haven't heard the Bosstones before, buy this album! It consists of best aspects of previous Bosstones albums and none of the bad.George"
5,Vintage Bosstones,"The Bosstones will never attain the commercial success they so richly deserve, but they continue producing increasingly better material. In fact, the Bosstones B-Sides are incredible as well. This disc revels in Dicky Barrett's amazing lyrical hooks, Lawrence Katz's screaming guitar, and the big, fat horn section. From the opening, title track to the last track, the Bosstones display a range of musicianship that no other band can match. Anyone who is a music fan should keep this disc in the player for a while."
1,"This is junk, stay away","Mexican men are macho rapists, gangsters or ineffective bureaucrats. Mexican women are semi-pagan, pious fools. There are self-serving corporate types and even a pushy, culturally-insensitive liberal female reporter.The story is absurd, the characters are unbelievable, the stereotypes are offensive."
2,Remastering helps,"This remastered version of Cooper's Welcome To My Nightmare concert in London is both good news and bad. First the good. The picture quality is improved significantly from the original release. The bad is that the sound quality is still fair to poor. Most annoying is the original editing of the movie...I know it was the 70's, but any amatuer with a video camera and basic editing ability could make a better video. Watching Cooper stagger and prance through this classic concert is still fun. But too bad that the event wasn't documented more effectively."
5,Smashing!,Astaire and Rogers really light up the screen in this musical hit. Their combination of voice and dance talent make this brilliantly written film into a heavenly masterpiece
5,Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers? a cosmic couple!,"Top hat is one of the top ten musicals in any time. Its charm is so fine , so human that still beats you besides this film dates from 1935. Astaire and Rogers make a couple hard to find ; the rapport among them was an artistic fact. You think in Gene Kelly , for instance in Singin n the rain and you feel the absence of the female counterpart Cheek to cheek , Isn{t a lovely day to be caught in the rain? . Top hat , White ties, and tails Piccolino and other songs from this mythical composer Irving Berlin become themselves in other actor.This film inspired Fellini in Ginger and Fred and more recently it was employed as a smart emotional link in The green mile.Captivating and overwhelming. A film for all the eternity!"
3,Charming Escape,"I would never have picked up this movie if it hadn't been for the touching scene in THE GREEN MILE when death row prisioner John Cofey requests a picture show on the eve of his execution and the warden selected TOP HAT. The ""Cheek to Cheek"" scene plays tenderly on the screen as tears stream down his face and he escapes into the wonderful romance of ""angels dancing in heaven.""Who cares if the plot is typical, predictable, and done a dozen plus times before?? No one could dance like Fred and Ginger and Top Hat proves that it's fun to ""escape"" now and then into the carefree and simple world and pure old fashioned entertainment of a 1930's picture show. Enjoy this gem. It will do your heart good!"
1,A piece of crap!,I'd really give it no stars. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. Save the $10 and also get the cooler feature with the First Years Night and Day system. This piece of junk doesn't warm up as fast as it says. The bottles are always still cold. The warmer lights flicker on and off indicating that the bottle is done but it's never warm. And there's no auto off like the night and day system.
1,Be Careful with this one!,Heats up the bottle in much less time than the directions say (I boiled my first bottle). The lack of on/off switch is unsafe. My hand slipped pulling the plug from the outlet and I hit the warmer and knocked it over -- scalding water and all! I was (thankfully) holding my baby away from the counter - but this could have been a disaster.
1,Terrible Bottle Warrmer,"This bottle warmer is a terrible design. It's way overpriced and worst of all it needs to be unplugged each time a bottle is warmed. Everyone says Avent products are the best, well this product will not help that reputation at all. I would NOT recommend this item, I actually went out and bought a different brand's bottle warmer."
3,Nice for traveling,"This was the first warmer we had when our son statred to drink from a bottle. We were happy with it at first, but as many of the other reviews say, there is no on-off switch. That is a pain. However, if you keep an eye on it, the bottles do warm up pretty quickly and evenly I still use it when I travel. It's small enough to fit in a suitcase. This would not be my first choice if I had to pick another warmer, but it's okay for when I need it."
3,"A good warmer, but could be better","I have been using this warmer for over a year now, and kind of stuck with it, which says it works overall. However, I totally agree with some readers' complaint. The most import one: it needs an audio alert to let you know the food is ready. I often found myself overheating the bottle when I got a fussy baby at hand. For the money spent on it, I shouldn't be standing around and watching and waiting."
4,baby feeding,"it's a very practical item, it saves time and avoids forgetting milk/food being overcooked/boiled!is very easy to clean.is not heavy at all, you can carry it everywhere."
2,Save your money,I didnt really care for this. I couldnt tell when the bottle was ready and the light would go on and off and not warm the bottle or else get it to hot. Might be user error but I didnt care for it.
3,It's OK,This bottle warmer is OK. It does its job but it doesn't automatically shut off when the bottle is warm thus causing the bottles to be overheated sometimes. It also is only good for Avent bottles. I have put Dr. Brown's bottles in there but you have to add more water for it to work. I also purchase The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer. I like it much better.
3,Built to last but burns the milk!,"I've had this warmer for 3.5 years, and have used it for both of my boys. It still works, after 3.5 years, as well as it did when I bought it. The only thing I don't like is that you have to add water almost everytime you use it, and that it doesn't have automatic shut-off. I have burnt much milk and formula in my life! (When you're chasing two kids, it's easy to forget you're cooking a bottle!) And, there have been times, too, that I've forgotten to unplug it for hours at a time... my fault, I know, but another reason auto-shut-off would be great."
4,"Have it, have rarely used it...","My husband and I received this warmer at our baby shower and while it was great to not have to walk downstairs to warm the bottles for early morning feedings, after Sofia hit 5 months, we never used it again. She's 9 months old now and it sits on a shelf in her nursery waiting for baby #2. I wouldn't buy it for myself, but I'd give it as a gift. I say that because it'll get more mileage than the typical cute outfit and will cost the same."
4,Great Warmer,"This is really a great warmer. It warms the bottles exactly for the time the instructions indicate. The only disadvantage is that it does not have an on/off switch. You have to unplug it to turn it off, which sometimes we forget. I was amused by some of the negative reviews because I find that it works just fine, it is so much better than running the bottle under tap water."
3,"OK, but I did not really use it","This warmer does the job, but you should be careful not to forget and leave the milk in it longer than it has to(unfotunatelly there is not timer or allarm), because it gets HOT in no time. That happened a couple of times to me and I stopped useing it. It was much easier for me to put the bottle in a hot water from the sink. That was doing the same - without overheating the milk and spending $40."
1,Doesn't have auto shut off!!!,I've burned 2 bottles so far - for this price they should put in an auto shut off - don't buy it. Get one w/ the shut off option.
3,Could've been better...,"I like this warmer only because I have my daughter to help most of the time. It gets the job done, warming baby's milk in about 4 minutes. It also offers a constant temperature setting which warms the milk to the right temperature and keeps it there which allowed me to put get baby's milk warm before feeding time and not have to worry about over-heating/rapid cool down issues.Unfortunately, there is no power on/off switch or no auto-shutoff feature, so it wasn't as great a product as I have come to expect from Avent."
4,Good product to have,I like this product since it is faster than putting bottles in a bowl of warm water. I don't like the control settings that much though...since it doesn't seem to be accurate...but I am happy to have this product.
5,AWESOME grill pan!,"I own a Loge grill pan, which was too heavy to use and very slow to cook the food. I wanted a lighter grill pan and this fit the bill. Sooo happy with it! Pan heats up quickly, very easy to use, and grills food very nicely (grill lines show up on the food). Highly recommend!"
2,Great idea for kids,The Garden root viewer was a great project for my 3 year old daughter but we were disappointed the carrot seeds never sprouted.
2,Not everything sprouted,"The onion seeds never sprouted, the carrots and radishes did sprout but after months of being in the little tubes, they never did grow any carrots or radishes under the soil. My 4 yr. old was disappointed and so was I. I did everything right. I finally gave up and dumped them out. Maybe the tubes are too skinny...I did give it two stars because he did get to see the tops grow, he loves to garden."
4,Gran Disco,Luis Enrique presenta su cuarto disco solista a donde logra una excelente producci√≥n. Busca a compositores por todas partes para gritar que la salsa est√° viva y consolidar su estatus de principe. Vale la pena ampliamente.Excellent for salsa lovers. Even if you don't understand the lyrics you'll be dancing and feelin love.
3,A Handful Of Time My Thoughts,"A handful of time is about a girl named Patricia who has to go to her aunt's cabin for the summer.When she gets there she doesn't like her cousins and her cousins don't like her.So one afternoon she comes across a cabin.She goes in there and she finds a watch under her floor boards and starts playing with it.Her aunt says that she needs to know how to row a canoe so her couisin Kelly teaches her.She doesn't want to learn , and she is also not doing to well.Patricia is a girl who hides in her own world.In this book you will learn alot and Patricia achieves alot.When you read this book you will see if she comes out of her own world,learns how to row a canoe and find out if she will like her cousins.So be sure to read this book to find out what happens to Patricia."
5,Excellent,USA made and the quality shows it. Replaced a worn-out set of Craftsman needle-nose.I would recommend these over tool truck pliers.
5,Ice Road Truckers Season 1,we watched this series on tv and enjoyed it very much. I have grandsons who are very interested in truck driving so this is a perfect gift.
5,I love Ice Road Truckers!!,"The DVDs are great. I can watch the shows when ever I eant to, not just when they are on TV!! LOVE IT!!"
4,Great Item,"This is a great set. I bought it for my son who loved the show, but was disapointed that it isn't on anymore (he's 5). Can't wait for the next season!"
2,Song on the Commercial,"On the TV commercial, they play a song thats nowhere on the CD. Besides the Peter Gabriel song, theres also a song that goes ""baby, youre amazing, i want, to let you see."" Why bother using a song to promote the movie, when youre not giving any credits to the song or artist?"
1,Song on commerical,was wondering why the song on the commercial for the movie is not on the soundtrack...i would like to know the name and artist of that song.
5,Works great already!!!,"Ok, I have been taking this product since a couple of days after Thanksgiving. I must say, I am pleasantly surprised! Yes, my urine does look like Mountain Dew (this effect is already starting to fade). However, my hair is so much softer and shinier since I've been taking this vitamin. I have also noticed that my nails are much stronger than they have ever been. Did I mention that my hair is growing already?The pills are rather large. I had to buy a pill crusher so I could mix the vitamin in with my applesauce."
1,Did not work for me,I have been using this product for three months but have noticed absolutely no thing! I follow the directions too but have seen no change at all! Also it tastes really bad and when I take it I feel I want to throw up. Don't waste your money on this.
2,ummmm?,"So, these tasted AWFUL! And I didnt notice a change in anything. I didnt even finish the bottle because they were just so gross."
5,Worked for me!,"In one month of use, my hair grew a full inch. My hair stylist was amazed!I have also noticed improvement in my skin and nails (less dry, less breaking).The only downsides are that the pills smell/taste gross (like most vitamins) and they are large. Also, because my hair is less dry I can't go as long between washes. But, honestly, those things are a small price to pay. I am going to have the long hair I had hoped for on my wedding day!! Hooray!"
3,Maxi-Hair,"After reading one reviewer mentioning this product contains Soy. I have a thyroid condition & am not suppose to have soy. So waring to others please read the ingrediants on the bottle or everyone's reviews.I am looking for a good hair grower without soy, so thanks to the person who mentioned that."
1,Did not work.,The most this did was make my urine yellow and smelly. My hair did not grow. And these tablets are a task to swallow.
2,BEWARE,Really made me break out!I know they said i would stop breaking out after the first week but I didnt even want to try. I had multiple pimples all over my face! Who wants long hair if that means an ugly face
3,It's ok / Biotin is better,It was ok. Since your looking at this product start searching for biotin supplement. It really feeds the fatty acids your hair needs to grow.
3,"Not too sure, but I guess it's working","A couple months after getting my hair cut, I didn't see much of a growth. Once I received these pills, I actually seen a slight difference. But everyone else seems to see a big difference, so maybe it is working."
5,Essential Listening,"Essential listening is what this album is. The Python team's individual and ground-breaking treatment of British society and history is exemplified in this album and it therefore serves as a perfect introduction, and summary, of the team's oeuvre. Python should be part of the national school curriculum of every country that feels is has something to brag about (and which doesn't think that?)The most entertaining, and accurate, British history lesson you could imagine on one album, plus a world view relevant to everyone.Buy it and worship at the shrine of the great god Python!"
3,Great Illustrations and Well Written,"This book was very informative about the expedition to Easter Island by Thor Heyerdahl. While, at times, the writing was characteristic of a journal...it was nevertheless informative and a good read."
5,Great Deal for Replacement Lens,Sometimes replacing the lens is all that is needed to return your lights to full functionality. These replacements lens are OEM and fit perfectly.
5,"I just own the ""Sleep Sheep"", but this seems like a great gift idea!","The ""Sleep Sheep"" has really been a lifesaver. We started using it when my daughter was a month old, and the sounds of the calming surf still work on her, three months later. The sounds are very soothing (there are 4: heartbeat, rain, surf, whale songs), there is a volume control knob - which is great (its not just ""high"" and ""low"" settings), and the sheep itself is just too cute!"
2,Uncle Ted Rants and Raves,"you know, I personally love Uncle ted, but, this book is not about his life, its about his view on politics, he goes on and on about how he hates the laws abd what he would do to make this a safer country. In short this is a collection of whining and crying about what HE thinks is wrong with the country. end of story"
5,Ted Tells It Like It IS!,Awesome book! Refreshing to read a book like this. A similar honest book I read with the same virtues was the hilarious KISS & Tell book about Ace Frehley by Gordon Gebert and Bob McAdams. I mention this because I heard Gebert on the Ted Nugent Show and both of them were promoting both books. I bought and enjoyed both immensely.
4,A good book for learning Portuguese,This book is really good at helping you get the grasp of the portuguese language. If you remember how you learned the english language it will help out alot. If you can't remember it will re-teach you the english that you did'nt learn.
3,A terrific beginning,"I love this album for one song and one song only, ""Happy Birthday to Me"". I play it full blast driving through town not only on my birthday, but most Fridays as well. I also love ""Mr. Wrong"" and ""Dr. Bernice"", too. A 10 each on the old prankster meter. ""Feelin' thankful for the small things. . ."" Thanks Dave and Johnny and Crew."
3,I like it!,"What more can I say. I had never heard of Cracker before, now that I have I will purchase at least one of their CDs."
3,"Good, but could be better","This book includes everything you need to take care of koi, but sometimes in too much detail. Many of the items in this book are exactly the opposite of what I have read elsewhere (e.g wheatgerm sticks are bad for koi??)While too much detail is usually the problem, there are also many parts when there are not enough facts to actually understand what thi book is trying to say.It's an OK beginners guide, but some parts can be tedious and confusiong."
4,Good but needs improvement.,This is a good manual for the do-it-yourself kind of person. I only wish that the manual came with a complete list of tools and diagrams for every job.
3,Meh.,"The novelization was much better. I did however love the Boba fett plot that was added, as well as the artists renditions of Leia and Fett. Absolutly amazing.However it just didnt have the power of others ive read. 3 stars"
5,Great for filling in the blanks of the movies,I thought that this book gave you backgrounds on some of the unknown things in the movies. It also explained the new video gameswith the SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE titles. It was avery well-writtenstory and I have recommended it to lots of other people. It had duels and even small wars in it and is one of the best of theSTAR WARS series.
4,Very good book.,"I read this book in 2 hours and do not regret it. It was definetely worth the $10 I paid for it. It gets a little confusiing at times, but you just gotta keep reading it. Now you can find out when and where Luke constructed his new lightsaber, and much more. If you are a star wars fan, you won't regret it, if your not, you probaly won't have any idea whats going on."
3,An average but interesting book.,Shadows of the Empire was a good book. It was a little boring at times but it did have some exciting parts. I really dug the rivalry between Darth Vader and Prince Xizor. Dash Rendar was cool but seemed liked a second coming and more arrogant Han Solo. I give the author credit because it takes real guts to write a book in between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi and expect people to buy it.
5,Great Product So Far.,"Needed a larger pan and this one has been perfect. It's light, came with a lid, and easy to clean. Very pleased with my purchase."
5,Awesome,This product was perfect and still working great! I have enjoyed collecting this series so far. I would definatly recomend this product for anyone interested in this show!
5,a wonderful documentary,"Flight from death is a ""must see"" documentary. I saw it three times since i've received the DVD last week and each time i discover new aspects. Images are beautiful and the commentary (narrated by Gabriel Byrne) is just outstanding. Before seeing it, i was a little bit anxious to see how they can translate in a documentary the rather complex thought of Ernest Becker. As a reader of Becker's books for many years i can tell that Patrick Sean and Greg Bennick had done a fantastic job. Each important parts of Becker's understanding of the impact of death anxiety on human behavior are explored and very well explained. I understand now why this documentary won seven prizes. Please do not hesitate to buy this DVD you won't regret it!"
3,"Not Perfect, but better than nothing","Having been a proponent of Ernest Becker's theories articulated in The Denial of Death since its publication in 1973, and of terror management theory, I came watch the movie with great expectation considering the past reviews. While acceptable as a purely introductory movie, it did not add much to my understanding of the subject of death's impact on human motivation and behavior. Still, by confirming the viability of Becker's ideas, my immortality project was enhanced. And that is always good!"
2,Not what I expected.,"This documentary has won a boatload of awards, but I was personally not too happy with it. After I watched the dvd I felt really depressed about everything around me. I felt hopeless. I was at a point in my life where agnosticism seemed to make sense to me. But I seriously felt different after seeing this. The one major flaw in the dvd is the one main professor in it sounds like a total burnout when he talks. I am sure he is well-respected and I know he is intelligent, but when he talks it is like fingernails on a chalkboard. This is just my personal take on it, but I would watch a friend's copy before dropping some cash on this. You can even buy mine if you want to...seriously."
1,face cream,"This stuff was sticky, did not let my makeup go on smoothly. I discontinued use after a month. Dont waste your money."
3,Okay,The book comes across to me as some type of revenge. The relationship was taking a turn that she did not want. If the minister had not decided to work things out with his wife would this book had been written?
1,Poorly written and edited.,"I am not going to address the political correctness of the book or the author's motives. However, I am going to suggest to the author and publisher to invest in a guide to proofreading. In my opinion, the book was poorly written and obviously not edited. I could not fully grasp the storyline without proofing the book. For those readers looking for a quality written piece of literature, keep looking."
4,Works like a charm!,"I just received two of these for our new home and I was able to put both up myself with no trouble. It looks great, compliments our patio and most important - it keeps our youngest daughter from slipping through the patio railings. The cords were a bit long but they were easy to cut to a more desired length to be less noticeable. The only problem with this product is that two were not long enough. It would be wonderful if Safety 1st offered this product in different lengths since we have a 2 1/2 foot gap in the railing after installing the netting - but that is easily covered by furniture. It looks great and you can't beat the price! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with a very inquisitive and busy toddler!"
3,Not a fan,"Tried installing this against our wraught iron railing, however, had very little luck making the screws work (may have been a carpet issue). May do the job but doesn't seem very sturdy."
5,Bores nice holes for my Blum 38N hinges,"I bought this bit to bore holes in the back of the cabinet doors I am making. I am using it in my cheap GMC bench top drill press to drill through 3/4 inch pine rails and stiles. It drills a nice even hole without any cut through to the front. The bottom of the hole is fairly flat, and doesn't leave any deep hole in the center. Seems pretty sharp, and does a good job at cleaning the sides of the hole.Don't even think of trying this bit in a regular drill unless you have it in a drill press type mount."
3,QQQ,"This phone was a gift for my husband and he loved it until the 2nd week when the speaker started to malfunction. He's still using it but every now and then the speaker will malfunction, but we learned a trick just turn it off for 2 minutes. Apart from that it's a wonderful phone and we like it!"
5,Listen.......,"WOW! What a great band!! Too bad there isnt any sound clips of this album but trust me it is AMAZING!! This will make any 1960's Brit Pop Fan Smile, What an undiscovered Gem of a band. The Merry Go-Round are from California and where led by a young lead singer who was very gifted with melody,he does channel Meet The Beatles Era McCartney, which is definitly a good thing. I always thought The BEatles where the only band who could play like this. I was wrong. it is really really great, easily one of my fave 60's bands beides The Beatles and The Kinks. These guys are 100 times better than comtemporaries like Hermans Hermits, and Dare I Say it The Byrds? I did, just better song writing that ages better, Sorry to Any Byrds fans out there."
1,Shameful,"If you expect this pillow to last the long haul, don't buy it. Therapeutica does not replace the pillow free of charge during the 5 year warranty. They prorate based on years of use and allow you to purchase a new one for a price near the cost of a brand new one. Not all it's cracked up to be. A little shady if you ask me. The customer service rep is really a piece of work. I had to send her pics of my clearly broken down foam pillow and a copy of the receipt and they graciously offered to let me buy one for $48.95 plus shipping as they prorated each year of use @ $12. Puleeeez."
3,Great idea...but,"Love this idea. I bought it along with the Ultimate Wipe Warmer made by the same company. The products claim to fit together by design and they do. However, I found that it did not fit my changing table with the wipes warmer on it. My changing table is a 'sleigh' type and the upper bar blocks the wipe warmer from fitting on top of the Diaper Depot. Unfortunately, I had to return this product for this reason. Great idea, if it fits your changing table."
2,Not good if you want to actually put sutff in it!!,"We got this item as a gift and at 1st it was great!! We stored everything in it full sized diaper wipe bin on top diapers and the holing area and creams, meds, and other gadgets in cubby holes on sides. Let just say it cracked in half. I would not ever buy this again."
4,works with Graco Pack N Play,"we bought a second hand pack and play and there was no diaper caddy attached as some pack n plays offer. I ordered this, fast 2 day prime shipping, and upon receiving it, immediately tried it (empty) on the side of the pack n play. It fit and appears to be secure on the side so we can use the pack n play changing pad and have our diapering needs close by."
4,Great Product!,"This is a wonderful product. Much more helpful than a standard diaper stacker as it holds your wipe tub, powder, rash lotion, etc. all together at the changing area. My only complaint is that sometimes two diapers pull out and it's a pain to stuff it back in or unload everything off the top to put back on the stack.But that's not a big deal and otherwise I love it!"
5,awsome!!!!!!,this is a wonderful product. saves space keeps things organized and is well made.....this is my second child and second diaper depot (gave the first away) a must have for all changing tables!!!!!
4,Fits nicely on changing table but two side pockets are not attached securely,"This diaper caddy is a wonderful addition to our baby room which has very little counter space to put stuff. It fits our munchkin diaper warmer but just barely and holds about 20 diapers in the storage below. When you do pull diapers out sometimes 2 or more come out. The side holders aren't locked in so if you try to pick up the entire diaper caddy just by holding the side pocket it will fall.If you're looking for more reviews of baby registry essentials, read the baby registry guide from AllMomsArePerfect.com. Good luck!"
2,Be careful,"Be careful when buying. This did not clip onto our crib or changing table because teh crib has a ""sleigh"" top and both are rounded and did not work witht the plastic."
2,Wipes Warmer Does Not Fit!,"I was excited to find this product since my little girl was getting longer & needed more room atop our changing table. Well, what a big disappointment when the wipes warmer did not fit snugly. We have the Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer, which is shown on the side of the box fitting nicely. Yeah, right. It teetered over the edge and looked as if it could fall off at any moment. Needless to say, I returned this organizer thing and made my own with a little ingenuity and only a few bucks. My prototype organizer works better and was much cheaper!"
3,can't use mine anymore!,"I loved this when my son was born, but found that I couldn't use it once we bought a different changing table (we had to return the one we borrowed from a friend). Anyway, there's no place to hang it now as the hanging part is too narrow. Also, I had to return my first one as it was cracked in the box, but I still loved it while I could use it."
5,'Mr. Lucky' is John Lee Hooker's masterpiece!,"John Lee Hooker should be proclaimed a National Treasure, and 'Mr. Lucky' is in my mind his masterpiece. It is not a 'greatest hits' collection, but a unified work of timeless music. 'Stripped Me Naked' is worth the price of the album alone. All-star supporting musicians!"
3,Mr. Lucky,"Not my favorite ""HOOK"" but good enough---but the jacket cover is worth whatever price is being charged to a collector like me"
5,All around best (scratch) protection cover,"I had the original I-skin with my older generation Ipod. So when I purchased a newer version ipod I knew that I wanted the same quality fit and protection. The new version comes with a thin layer of silicon skin covering the click wheel which adds further protection to the ipod. Although the marketing write up says that you don't have to remove iskin to place in cradle, this simply is not accurate but not that really big a deal."
5,Pathology,It is an excellent book to study in order to perform well on the USMLE step I in the field of pathology.
4,EXCELLENT REVIEW!!!,CONCISE AND COMPREHENSIVE ENOUGH TO BUILD CONFIDENCE!!I RECOMMEND TO ALL MEDICAL STUDENTS AS AN ADJUNCT TO PRIMARY TEXT: ESPECIALLY THOSE PREPARING FOR USMLE STEP 1
5,"The Best Pathology Review, No Need for Goljan's Rapid Review","I studied for the boards from this book and was exactly what I needed, don't waste your time with Goljan's Rapid Review because is really hard to read or understand, get my advise and pass step 1 with this concise and very well written book, you will find what you need with no need to get those messy Goljan;s notes. The book is easy to read and digest. I recommended 100%"
4,Stone alone!!!,"Si hay algo que Mick Jagger debe envidiarle a Keith Richards es su carrera como solista, nada comparable. Cuando escuches al Keith, te daras cuenta quien es el que coloca el toque maestro en las canciones de los Stones. Contiene lo mas granado de su carrera como solista: ""Take it So hard"", ""Whip It Up"", ""I could have stood you up"" (de lo mejor del disco). Tan solo 4 temas Stones. ""Time is on my side"" vocalisada por Sarah Dash, ""Connection"" del ""Between the Buttons"" mucho mejor que la version original, ""Too Rude"", que es muy parecida a la original y ""Happy"" por supuesto la mejor de todas, una version de m√°s de 6 minutos de duracion (insolitamente sin ningun solo de guitarra incluido). ¬øPor que no 5 estrellas?. Hay que reconocerlo, a Keith le falta mucho feeling en vivo. Una verdadera l√°stima!!!"
2,Not good for much.....,"Doesn't work well at all. Cans constantly hang up at some point. I'm using 5 of these presently and can only say they keep the different drinks in an orderly fashion.......I bought them, therefore they're being used ! Good for a garage sale................"
2,"Really convenient, but shatters if you look at it too hard.","This thing looks great on paper - very high can capacity for taking up so little space in the fridge. Cans dispense easily, yet they don't come flying out while you're loading it.However, of the four I bought, two have already cracked just from assembly. I wouldn't dare tote these things around by the handles, but stacked two high in the fridge they're probably ok.unless you move them, or stack things on them, or look at them hard, in which case they'll probably go to pieces."
3,12 pack can holder,"they work, but if you stack the bottom tends to let cans stick rather than fall. (some mechanial agitaion needed to free them up)if you are planing to carry them I have no idea, kinda cheap feel and I am not gonna try it."
5,WOO HOO I LOVE THIS CD!!!!,"I love this CD, you have to purchase it. You don't know what you're missing!! One time I listened to it six times in one night, thats how good it is!!! And the guys are super nice too!"
2,more reference than street smarts,"I was looking for a street smarts sort of guide. This is not it. Perhaps it is really only designed to assist with a path to certification. It is written more like a reference manual with very short detail on each subject. With a title like street smarts, I'd expect things that are not found in SQL online help. But this does not have that.To its credit, it covers topics in a thorough manner and is simple to follow and use for finding information. It also covers a vast array of topics."
4,Everywhere computers - everywhere useful?,"If you want to read a critical review on computer revolution -and the Internet is just the last one - then give this book a try.Besides it's fun to read, you will find arguments that should at leaststartle you (for example the comparison snail-mail vs e-mail)If you are a computer enthusiast, this book is the right starting pointto think about where to use computer - and where they are abused."
5,Required reading for anyone with a computer it is GREAT!!!!,"Cliff Stoll hits the bullseye dead center with this book. It should be read by anyone who is online or planing to be. Cliff debunks all the myths about the ""better living with computers than with out them. This book will make you think."
2,Like a literary time capsule,"Clifford Stoll is not a terrible writer. His powers of prediction, however, leave much to be desired. Warning us against the perils and pitfalls of such evils as internet commerce, Stoll paints a picture of the internet as a dark place doomed to languish in obscurity, because people are obviously much too smart to communicate with others primarily through a computer.Basically, the mere fact that I'm reviewing this book a) online and b) at a site like Amazon prove Stoll's central, secondary, and tertiary theories utterly, utterly wrong. But if you want some Clinton-era, luddite nostalgia, then by all means pick this up."
3,Good but not great,"Stoll wrote one of the best spy books of the information age before anyone knew that it could even happen. This follow up is very interesting reading, and I agree with most of it. The best part is his feeling to turn off the computers in schools and go back to the personal interaction of learing. That is so true, we are harming our children for the future."
3,Stainless Steel?,"The paddle is awesome, the size is fantastic but the welding done where the paddle attaches to the handle was poor and was not plated.I wanted to use mine for brewing beer but when I took it out of the sanitizing solution areas around the welds had rusted and made the tool unusable as a brewing utensil. Now I use the paddle for soups, broils, and boiled peanuts but I can't use it for the reason I purchased it."
4,Brew Gigantic!,"I love this paddle, makes my house feel like a real brewhouse! That being said, this thing is monstrous! I have a 10 gallon cooler as a lauter/mash and this thing is waaaaay too big for that. I still use it once in awhile on big beers to help move grain around (stouts, 15lb+ beers, etc) but I have to have it on the ground and it sticks way up. It also hits my filter in the bottom and is hard to sneak between the edge of the wall and my kettle screen. All in all though a good product, I just got one way too big!"
4,"Anything for my kid, when I can.","My daughter and I, really got into the Batman Animated Series, and she had just finished her belt test, (and passed) so as a surprise I got her three favorite characters. They are not real sturdy and for all the collector geeks who are upset at this news, she enjoys playing with them. Sorry guys, toys are meant for kids to enjoy, and not to sit on shelves and collect dust. The product came in good condition as advertised, and they're a little flimsy for my liking and I overpaid, but bottom line is they are nice in detail and exactly what she wanted."
3,Disappointed,"Not a horrible film, but nothing great either. I was expecting a lot more considering the two main actors' great performances in other Danish films. This is one of those films you just watch once."
3,Marinade's Just Right,"This is quite a twister, even granted its revisiting the familiar territory of, Delicatessen. The straighteness, the dourness of these Danes give it an extra dryness that had me in fits. Everything this team of actors and director touches is worthy of a visit...Adam's Apple, Open Heart etc. The scripts are tight and convoluted, the morphing of real and surreal has a compelling edge.The editing is tight. And you'll not see better acting anywhere as I write."
3,"""Aim"" is off","The book is filled with info, but it ""focuses"" on the digital SLR, rather than the point and shoot. There should have been a warning in the description. It's still useful."
1,beware,"took 850 shots in spain. then card fails. am unable to retrieve any images. seagate says: ""too bad.""grrr.."
3,OK,"This game comes from the same line of games as Europa Universalis and Hearts of Iron. Two Thrones is not as good as EU, but can still be fun. The scope of the game (really only a strategic war between England and France) limits this game somewhat. AI is not very intelligent and easy to beat. This game is worth the price."
1,"It's a dictionary, alright, but....","Pros: Got to my house very, very quickly! I like Amazon's Prime delivery options!!Cons: So, I decided to order this dictionary for my Intermediate Japanese college class, since the professor recommended getting one. Well, I decide to buy if off of the rating, and the fact it said ""Eng-Jpns Jpns-Eng"" on the description. So I thought ""Awesome! I'm getting this, and it's only $10!"" How wrong I was, I thought the dictionary would use kana characters, but instead uses Romanized characters! What the heck!? Item is NOT as advertised! They should change it to say it's Romaji and not hirgana/katakana! Be warned!"
2,"It's okay, but not what I expected","I agree with the other two star reviewer that this book is okay, but not worth the hype. It is basically a typical grammar exercise book with some interesting, but not overly different, lessons. The content seems geared more towards middle school than upper elementary. I couldn't find anything in the description to suggest it was geared to that group so I had purchased it hoping for a match. Also, the pages are extremely boring in presentation, which adds to the lackluster review. I had really hoped for more. As for for other suggestions that may be better (although I'm still reading these and forming my opinions): Mechanically Inclined, Funner Grammar, Teacher's Guide to Sentence Combining.This book will be returned."
3,Nice but...,Wouk have been nice if it was spiral bound. It's a great resource but hard to copy. Overall. A good product for middle school teachers.
5,"Good, Fun Book!",My students like when I use material from this book. The approach is different from the typical textbook worksheets. I enjoyed using this book when I teach grammar.
5,Great shoe,"Excellent quality, and strong for a child, I have brought my daughter upon the recommendation of a friend, she has 3 pairs for when she outgrows these..."
3,My curls won't stay in place >__<,"I don't know if it's my hair (it's kinda thick) but not even with lots of hairspray it won't stay put for very long U_U...and i dont like the heavy sprayed look, I want my curls to look natural so without spray theres no way I'll get the look i want..and the tool is super hot! >_<"
2,poorly edited.,"The sound is poor and the continuous splicing of clips after clips of lectures could make for a boring sitting! They really didn't do any justice, and where's the new info. of 2008?"
4,great for undergraduate study,"I bought this book recently and I love it. I think this would be a great supplement to a General Biology course, but is too detailed for regular use in a high school biology course, with the exception of AP. I think it is a little too detailed for a high school bio class, although it covers everything that I was introduced to in my Bio 110 course.A slight caution--many people may see the title and bright cover thinking this would be a 'fun' way to learn or a great 'fun' gift to someone interested in science. In reality, it's set up like a textbook. It's meant to be a serious aide to someone learning biology. In that sense, it's a great tool, but this isn't like the coloring books we used as kids! So don't be misled.For those of you looking for a supplement to a high school class, perhaps the ""Biology Coloring WORKBOOK"" would be a better choice."
5,Very Positive book,"The book was given to me as a gift. I cannot tell you how great it was, to start a Sunday Morning out, in such a positive way. Jesse James has a great sense of humor , but still profound. His namesake would be proud.I hope he does another book soon. I am a new fan. Very impressed!"
2,Great Subject...Lousy Book!,"What a great story! Capital Group has one of the most amazing long-term performances and is one of the most unique organizations in the industry! But this book just stinks. I can barely believe the Charlie Ellis wrote this. It's completely disjointed. There's no structure at all. It's like they just published his notes. He skips across generations within a single paragraph. He contradicts himself. About 150 of the 300 pages is fluff and adds nothing to the story. About 1/3 of EVERY page is footnotes that add nothing. He references chapters within the same chapter. It's just terrible. It's obvious the publisher was just in a hurry to get the book out to make a buck off the mutual fund scandal before the hype died off. How ironic that Capital Group takes a long term approach, launching new funds against the tide, while the people at Wiley (by launching this book before it was ready) have shown themselves to be a bunch of short-sighted money grubbers."

1,No BP-970 battery charging with this,"The picture shows 5 adapter plates,mine came with 3 which mean I did not get the one for my Canon xh-a1s which uses the BP-970battery. I can I guess still use it on my BP511 and G9 batteries, but I did not need that. Very angry!"
1,un-installable,"I spent about 6 hours trying to install one of these locks, I finally gave up - you need a magnifying glass to read the instructions and see the pictures, and none of the pictures seem to correspond to the instructions- I wasted $20 on these locks which are now sitting in a bag in my garage. I'm usually pretty good with assembling things (I've installed my own ceiling fans and built my own shelves!) - but these are impossible - dont waste your money."
4,T'was a very good movie,"this movie was extreamly entertaining and if you like anything that has a paranoid,erie and dark feel to it you'll enjoy it alot."
2,Awful,"I believe Problems of knowledge is a very biased book, because from the very beginning Williams has the goal of selling you his version of contextualism. His treatment of coherentism, foundationalism, and other epistemological theories is geared only to set up his own views of which he overly generalizes in order to hide many of his own shortcomings. His argument for why contextualism isn't a form of relativism is especially bad. However, it is not as terrible of a book as my first review implied. Chapter five on Aggripan skepticism is very good, and the book gives an excellent overall summation of the history of epistemology. In regards to writing style, I find that the book is very dense and dull, and Williams' sentences are often not very clear. To make matters worse, it is also a very difficult book, and one that I would not suggest to someone not highly interested and trained in philosophy."
5,Neat Resource!,"Great way to get an overview of many of the classics that have been enjoyed and read by so many over the years. Detailed synopsis, author details, and much more! Worth owning and having on the shelf or bathroom basket as it may be LOL!"
4,Interesting Idea,"Don't let the misleading title fool you. You shouldn't be ashamed to buy this wonderful book. The Bathroom Book series are jam packed with the best books ever written condensed into two page summaries. Everything from Steven King to Shakespeare is inside. Useful for getting some background info on a certain book if you plan on seeing the movie, or if you know you've read that book but can't quite remember what happens, this book refreshes your memory."
3,SHADE DOESN'T MATCH,"Shade of white does not match purchased dinnerware, as implied!!! Perhaps Corelle should consider making accessories out of the same material and colors as their dinnerware."
4,2-piece gravy boat,"I bought this gravy boat for thanksgiving. We have a small gathering of around 10 people and this is more than enough for our need. I ordered it at the last minute and thanks to amazon, received it just in time. The best thing I loved about it is that the saucer is not attached to the gravy boat. I really wanted a set with a ladle and for the price I paid, I felt that the ladle should have been included. However if you don't mind pouring directly, it is great without the ladle too. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase, but there are similar products out there for less and if it hadn't been a last minute purchase when all the other good gravy boats were out of stock, then for the price this product would not have been my first choice."
5,Wonderful Gravy Boat,Gravy boat is easy to use. Even my grandchildren enjoy it. Is very well balanced for easy use and very good looking. Keep bringing us great items like this one. Thanks again.
4,Digital Multimeter RSR Multimeter MS 8000 Series,"Purchased as a gift. The meter seems like a good one, but it needs to be used to determine that."
3,a superlative novel about attila the hun,"the magic of this book does not depend on the plot but on the crisp dialogue , the tense succession of episodes , the kaleidoscopic change of scenes ! costain at his best - setting his scene with high competence and keeps his plot at the bubbling point to the end..."
4,Could have taken the best tracks combined it with anything goes,"This music is challenging and a bit esoteric. The compositions are rich and full of unexpected harmonic twists and turns. We have come to expect this from Mehldau. The energy level is slightly muted, much like ""Places"" another recording of completely original music. It may take repeated listening to get inside of this music.Brad Melhdau is a brilliant and unique musician. it is extremely difficult to create a singular voice as a pianist. He has done this more than most musicians who have come out of the jazz resurgence of the 90's.All of Mehldau's CD's are recommended, but this might not be the first one to buy if you've never heard him before. Try Art of the Trio Vol. 4, or Anything Goes."
1,Only One Shoe Fit,"I ordered these for an elderly relative (female) who has difficulty putting on shoes and walking. Over the years, she has purchased several pairs of lace-up navy blue Keds with which she was very satisfied. Due to this, I ordered her size (8 narrow) in this slip-on style. Unfortunately, while one shoe fit perfectly, the other one was much too loose - at least a size too big! I'm not sure why this is the case, but I tried to remedy the situation by buying heel pads. This did not help. I even stuck two heel pads together and they still did not make the shoe fit. These shoes will be returned soon. We have since found a pair of Sketchers that fit her much better."
4,keds,"Shoe is fine, but it runs not wide enough. I had to ware them for a week so they can comfortable fit."
1,Poor quality,"Shoes are not like other Keds I've worn in the past. They have little support, are flimsy, and look cheap."
3,Word 'Beginning' in the title is misleading,"If you are looking for a comprehensive text on PHP and do NOT have a programming background, you may want to start somewhere other than this volume. It is definitely NOT geared toward the rank amateur. I got this book to learn PHP and more specifically to help me integrate forms better into my Web pages. Sadly, 'Chapter 11: Forms and Navigational Clues' has only about ten pages of PHP as it relates to forms and half of that is semi-useful scripting examples. I'm sure this book is a fantastic reference if you are already familiar with programming but if you are a PHP novice, like I am, this book is not where you want to start."
3,A brief comment,"This film has its moments, and the Elvis impersonator/parachuters late in the movie are sort of funny, but overall it's sort of a poor man's An Indecent Proposal with Robert Redford, Woody Harrelson, and Demi Moore, but with a slightly different premise. As I said, it occasionally has its moments, but all in all there's not a whole lot to distinguish the movie, although as one writer here commented, the film gets some points for its unvarnished and unbiased portrayal of some of the more unsavory aspects of people and of life in general. Even the portrayal of Caan, who plays a manipulative gambler, is pretty even-handed and neutral. I like Caan and Cage as actors, and this is probably the only time they've worked together, so perhaps the film is somewhat noteworthy for that, and Parker is easy to look at, too. So although not a great movie, I could recommend it as a rental for a dull night, especially if you're a Cage or Caan fan."
1,Honeymoon in Vegas,This is a review of Amazon's product. The ad fails to mentioned the movie was subtitled in French which was so distracting it made the movie worthless. Amazon should disclose DVD's with flaws. Shame on Amazon.
4,Little Atlas - Progressive Rock From Miami,"Little Atlas is a progressive rock band out of the Miami area. They have earned accolades locally have garnered a small national following. The band is led by vocalist, keyboardist, and guitarist Steve Katsikas who also writes all of the material. This is a nice little album. The songs are mostly in the 5 to 7 minute range and are quite accessible. The band pretty much sticks to the basic guitar, keys, bass, drums format with Katsikas vocals on top. The playing is all good, and the songwriting is relatively strong. This is an album that will probably not blow you away at first listen, but give it time and it tends to grow on you."
4,Nice Simple Keyboard,I bought this keyboard to upgrade from a microsoft photo keyboard and I am NOT disapointed. I like wired products over wireless due to no having battries die on you wile gaming. The back light is very nice and great in a dark room. only down side is that at a 30 degree viewing angle you cant read the keys but at 45 degrees its perfect. The dim setting on the keyboard is kinda pointless cause its just too dim to see but on the max setting its just right. The keys are nice and responsive with out and delay or sticking.Purchase and you wont be disapointed
3,No big deal,"I don't know. I thought this would be a lot cooler. It looks neat in the picture, but now that I have it, it is basically a glorified keyboard that cost me 50 bucks."
3,Gamers Beware,"Just got this and wanted to say: the ""lighted"" feature is great for typing in low light so that's fine. Also the keys are responsive and have a good feel to them. But there is an issue for gamers, the arrow keys cannot support more than two key presses at a time. This is a known issue if you do further research. So if you play games and ever use the arrow keys to move or drive, just know it is two at time. If you are pressing forward to move and a side key to turn, you will for example, not be able to jump with a third key press, or whatever your game requires. Now this oddly enough is not an issue if you use WASD to move, then you can press three (I even tried four and it worked) with no issue. Arrow key users beware, now you know."
2,Not a happy camper!,"I've owned this for almost a year and now the keys are cracking. I lost two in the last week, the control and shift key.I expected more with the lighting but it too is poor, not bright enough to be of use.I've searched and searched for a good keyboard and come up empty, almost every one has its problems.I recently bought the Logitech G15 and it arrived with Italian keys. Apparently there are three different G15's available.I'll keep searching but I think it's hopeless.Beware of which G15 you buy if you are considering one."
3,"good keyboard,but-----","I bought this keyboard because I am a lousy typist.Cannot touch type which would be the solution to my problem.It is good looking and has a nice touch.My problem with it is the size of the letters on the keys.Too small,even with the illuminated background.I needed to use my desk lamp anyway.So I sent it back. Amazon was fast with a full refund.This might be just the thing for some,but not for me.Maybe new glasses and typing lessons!"
1,sucks,"This keyboard worked fine at first but after about six months the keys malfuntioned. I have to hit certain keys a few times before they do anything. I've had problems with keys sticking too, my shift key sticks a lot. It was a waste of money, I will have to throw mine out."
4,"Nice as far as it goes, but should go farther...","Pros: This is a GREAT keyboard! It lights up through the keys unlike the xenix. It has a smooth keystroke and the keys are positioned correctly, even has a large backspace button!Cons:Won't work with USB to PS2 adapter through a KVM. Don't bother. No USB hub on the keyboard. Lights are difficult to see in a dim room, even on HIGH setting.More:This keyboard is great, I love it! But it could be better. Stronger lights would allow you to have them running in dim rooms instead of dark. My office is like a cave and during the day the keys are indistinguishable, but at night this little sucker lights up like a christmas tree. Much easier on my BF2 game :) If only the lights were a few lumens higher they'd be perfect."
2,Go with the PC Gamers Keyboard instead,"I previously purchased the PC Gamers Keyboard and thought this would be a nice upgrade. WRONG! Sent this back immediately after opening...Backlighting was very dim and silver keys were hard on the eyes....was a nice try, but not good enough."
4,Lighted Saitek Keyboard,Great keyboard for the price. The blue light is really soothing at night but it doesn't show up all the keys real sharp.
2,not great,"The coating on the keys is poor and has begun wearing off after only 6 months. Its the ""gap"" in the coating that creates the letter shapes. Therefore, some letters will soon be hard to read. N and M already look like blobsAlso: I use the volume controls frequently.. NONE of them are back lit,Also, the position of the light source behind the numeric keys make it very hard to read the punctuation marks that you use with the shift key. For example, when you need #,$,or % I have to shift far forward over the keyboard to see these symbols."
4,Saitek Keyboard great but missing 1 feature...,"Keyboard is great, lighting is not need during the day and actually makes it hard to see the keys (if you are looking when typing) so I tend to turn off the lighting during the daytime hours. Works great in the dark though. Great feel and nice soft sounding keys when you are typing.Only drawback is there is NO volume control on the keyboard... other than that it is a great keyboard."
3,worked fine until it didn't,"I have had this keyboard for a bit over a year...it worked fine until today, when it suddenly and oddly failed--when I try to hit certain characters, I get other characters...for example, pressing the tab key gives me asdf instead...and the backspace gives me the backslash (\) instead. Naturally it is past the 1 year warranty, so I have to decide whether to get another one (I really need the backlighting...)I am not a heavy user nor a gamer, so I did not have the problem with the paint wearing that others have reported.Also, for those of you with keyboard trays--the shape of the keyboard makes it difficult to fit well in an under-desk tray, and the cord comes out in an awkward place (at least for my tray)...maybe stress on the wire contributed to its demise."
2,An O.K. Keyboard with Cheesy Backlighting and no Fn Key,"I wanted a keyboard that I could use in low light with both my PC and Mac, and this one is reasonably o.k. Those users who enjoy the backlight of a Mac PowerBook or MacBook Pro will be disappointed by the cheap approach Saitek used to illuminate the keys, though. On the Mac, each key has its own embedded light under the key. On the Saitek light is splashed under the entire keyboard, reducing the contrast and making it much harder to see the keys. But it's better than nothing, and is helpful in low light. It would have also been nice if they had an Fn key, but such is life."
1,Did not receive,I did not receive this item nor have heard from seller although I have sent messages asking when I would get it or where it was. It have been almost a month lacking 1 day. I would like the book if I could get it for I am reading this series to my sick husband.
4,"Not your traditional ""story.""","I liked it! Don't worry about a plot! It's all the characters, with whom it is surprisingly easy to get involved.At first, you wonder how you are going to follow so many main character, but Adams' style really brings everything to life. I found this to be a 'real' novel in the sense that that is how life is - everything changes, are we ever satisfied?, and we can't solve other's problems; so have to live our own lives. Entertaining, intelligent, and an interesting, detailed San Fran. setting. I couldn't get into the 80's era that it was supposed to represent though. Don't try it if you are looking for a ""story"" that builds up to final ending."
5,Best book,This book was really really good. As soon as I got it I could not put it down. I recommend it to any fan of Sweet Valley.
5,I could NOT keeps my hands off this book,This is a GREAT book. It really surprised me that Elizabeth would cheat on Todd. And I can't believe that Sam ended up with Jessica. But I think Liz should have dumped Todd. I don't think she really likes him that much. I thought this one was way better than Jessica's diary Vol. 3. You should read Jessica Vol 3 and A Night To Remember.
4,A Forgotten Classic.,"It is probably seven years since I saw it last time. But it is a fabulous crazy-comedi, which I really would like to see again. The story takes place during or after a kind of civil war. There is a group of people who knows how to stop it, and they try. They meet all sorts of different people and warrios; the all girl-army and the man whos arms or legs yuo cut of turns in to more men of the same look. A brilliant film."
4,A great show,"Nyan Koi is a comical show about a teenage guy who accidentally breaks a holy cat statue and thus becomes cursed. In order to lift the curse he must perform good deeds to cats, the only problem is that he's allergic to them. He also has the issue with deal with a number of fellow classmates vying for his affections. The only thing I found unfortunate was that there was no attempt to dub the series."
4,really liked it,"I've read books by Susan May Warren and have liked them. This book is a story of love, regret and redemption. I look forward to reading more in the series."
4,Excellent asset for intermediate level Chinese,"I found this entire book serries for $1.50 at a used book sale and didn't even look at it until recently, but when I did I was amazed. I have extensively used both of today's most popular Chinese texts New practical Chinese Reader and Integrated Chinese in different classroom enviroments. This is far superior to either for a student studying independently. Grammar explainations are much clearer than Integrated Chinese and there's more practice for new patterns. Also there are several translations of famous stories and anecdotes from classical Chinese, giving the book more cultural value. As for the general format of the book. You can tell NPCR was based off of it. This book is not worth 24.95 but if you can find it used it is a big help. The cons are that this book is available only in simplified characters and there's no guide as to character stroke order (not that hard anyway for simplified)"
2,Handle the Crack,"To our surprise, when we lifted a pot full of tea by the handle, a hairline fracture occurred across the handle. Perhaps this is too much weight for the handle to ""handle""? And, perhaps you should make sure you support the teapot with the other hand as you lift.This may be a unique experience. Otherwise, up to the crackup the teapot was great. It is large, well-shaped, and a nice addition to the dish set."
3,no companion cd,yale university press no longer produces the CD and a lot of the text is companion listening. many words are pronounced phonetically different than written and the CD would be useful. i had no luck finding it.
2,"Thorough book, but dated and lacking kana and kanji","Well, I can say that this book is extremely thorough. It will teach you how to speak Japanese fairly well, if you can wade through it. However, I personally dislike this book.This book is quite dated, as are all Jorden books. We're talking 40 years here. What's worst is the lack of kana. You won't be able to read Japanese at all. You can study kana and kanji on your own and in a class, but you'll never be very good at it unless you work yourself to death. Textbooks with kana and kanji in them, such as Nakama or the extremely good Genki are great in that you begin to be able to read Japanese nearly as fast as you can understand it, and kanji recognition is much easier."
1,Trial By Fire,"This is not a great book although it can be used as a great illustration as to ""you should always write about what you know best."" In this case, I find it difficult to believe the author knows a thing of combat, World War II, history in general, making love or story telling. The story line is weak. The dialog is corny and the book is quite poorly researched. Even the ""cussing"" is forced and complete gratuitous - I doubt if the author ever listened to a GI talk. The book reads much like a Harlequin, a poorly written one. I would suggest the author stick to his empty Westerns. Jacket and in-book synopsis are quite misleading."
2,"Fine concept, but...","As a sufferer from Crohn's Disease, I was particularly interested in reading how a doctor would explain it to a child. I was disappointed. No child I know would talk to another using these words. The dialog was stilted, didactic and inappropriate for the age level. It is understandable that a doctor would have trouble talking on a simple level about a disease that is not simple.The idea of making flowers from toilet paper, supposedly due to the numerous and lengthy trips to the bathroom that are often necessary, is a cute hook. However, in reality, many of those trips are too painful to be creative at the same time.In summary, I don't think a child would understand the condition too much better after reading the book. They need easier words."
4,Solid rediting of first edition,"This edition of the text is an improvement on the first edition in its movement away from the east-coast view of women's history and a move towards a more inclusive analysis. As to the lack of definition of such terms as ""oppression"", as alluded to in another critique of the text, one is tempted to answer ""I know it when I see it...,"" postmodernism just being the latest form of academic ""oppression."" Clearly Sara Evans is an outstanding practioner of history and one whom understands the skill of an historian's work. How easy it is to criticize that which you know so very little about."
1,Not Logitech!,"I ordered this believing it was from Logitech, when it arrived, it was labeled at ""Labtec,"" a company Logitech purchased. I feel misinformed by Amazon because the page clearly states it is a Logitech mouse and keyboard when it is not."
2,Fireplace guard,"I bought this item for my sister-in-law and then later one for myself and we both feel it isn't all that great of an item. I felt it was a little pricey for what you get. The cushion doesn't stay on very well. It comes with double sided stick tape to put it on the edge of the fireplace and it comes off very easily. My 8mos old is now crawling and grabbing edges of tables etc. to pull himself up and he pulled it right off the fireplace. It has good cushion to it, but just doesn't stay in place. My sister-in-laws came up off her fireplace just like mine did and she wasn't that impressed with it. If you can find another product, I would try it first. I have seen some in magazines, they cost more, but might be worth it if they stay in place."
4,Works great,"It is so annoying that my son figured out how to rip these off.. but at the same time I love this product. Very soft, cushy, works great, looks nice, easy install. No complaints here! Makes me feel more comfortable with him playing in the living room : )"
2,Does not stay stuck on,"My son was able to pull this off right away. I'm constantly retaping it to the fireplace. When it does stay on, it's great. Have prevented a few bruises/cuts."
4,Does a good job,We have a standard fireplace hearth (no odd angles) that is about 6 feet wide and this has worked out great. It sticks to the brick without a problem and my 11mo old plays on our fireplace constantly. Since we bought these from BabiesRUs He has managed to get one piece off but considering he weighs 25lbs and has been pulling at these constantly I'm only taking 1 star off. Otherwise this is doing a great job keeping him safe and reapplying the one piece isn't that hard.I bought the brown ones and both my wife and I actually think it looks pretty good on our gray brick fireplace and brown tables. We also bought a 4 pack of their edge guards after the first two brands we tried couldn't survive my son's curiousity. I'm sure my kid will still find some weight to hurt himself but hopefully now it won't be a call 911 kind of hurt.
1,Wish I had done more research,"I bought this product to protect my son. As soon as he could maneuver himself over to the fireplace, the first thing he did was rip the strips off. They dont adhere well to brick and did not fit together properly. It was a total waste of money."
1,This book is hardly a dream; it is a nightmare.,"I simply do not understand why people are going crazy over this book, claiming it has deep meaning and that the character is persecuted and misunderstood. Rather, he is self-centered, foul-mouthed, inconsiderate, and dislikable. He shows disrespect to others and breaks the law for the sake of no one but himself. Worse than that, the reader has to sit through his long descriptions of what he does or has done to make himself more in touch with his rather phony-sounding ""Indian identity."" But perhaps the worst thing of all, is that this book, while advertised as a story that shines a noble spotlight on the Dakota tribe, does just the opposite, as the tedious and immature narration makes the time-honored traditions of the Indians sound like utter buffoonery. Therefore, if you wish to be spared a period of utter torture, I suggest you do not waste your money on this wretched waste of paper and ink."
2,Not the Best By Far,"I think that is sad that my High school chose to use this book. My friends have such nicer ones. I would not recommend buying this book, it is out of the 1980's and turns today's French learners off to the French language and culture."
2,Hohner Bluses Harp,Been using for years --- the wood really gives it a great natural sound. Reeds last a reasonsble amount of time with moderate abuse. Can blow them them out but sounds GOOD doing it!
2,Commercial Slant,"With the exception of an interesting theory on the difference between ghosts and spirits, this book wasn't very helpful, informative nor interesting. There is a definite commercial slant as all of her ""answers"" are set-ups for her to refer you to her other books, etc. Glad I checked it out from the local library instead of paying for it."
5,exceeded expectations!,"Don't be afraid to order this bed frame sight unseen!I am so glad I did. What quality, and we were overwhelmed!"
1,Water spots and rust,I have limited counter space so this seemed like an ideal solution for a dish rack. It looked nice out of the box but the base rusted fairly quickly and left unsightly water spots that would not scrub off. Went into the garbage. Now I just use a microfiber towel I can just hang after.
2,Not stainless,"I bought this item, after few months, you can see it rusting away.. compact? yes... stainless? no."
1,not so good,came dented (2 times) just sent it back and bought a diffrent brand. the new one is even nicer than this one and better quality for same price.
1,Small,This Rack is rediculously small! It doesnt even hold dishes well i would not reccomend getting this it doesnt take up much space but i found that the spaces inside the rack to be too small!
2,Polder drainer,"I have a 10.5"" wide niche next to my sink that I would love to put a drainer in, so this seemed ideal. I got it set up, and then tried to dry some dishes in it. I will say, if you only use dishes, and nothing else---cups, pans, glasses---it would probably be fine. But if you want to put anything else in, it just doesn't hold it.It does sit within a large sink, so if you think you could use a small drainer that way, it might work. I had to send it back, though---just didn't do the job."
2,Not Completely Stainless...,Nice and compact. Works fine - lack of cup holders a bit of an issue but for the size understandable. The only thing I have a problem with is while the tray may be stainless and the silver-wear holder cage is stainless - the rack is not (or is of such a low grade of stainless as to allow rust). The rack is rusting where it sits in the tray. Buy this only if you wish to wash and dry it after every use.
4,Very nice c.d.,"My favorite Christmas music is religious music, not so much of the ""Santa"" stuff. This c.d. work very well for me because of that. I recommend it to anyone who also prefers religious Christmas music."
5,Good tub for the in-between months,"I would recommend this tub for those with the extra space to store since it is quite large, it can be left in the regular bathtub when not being used or hooked onto the wall. Good for babies that are too big for the infant tub and too large for the big tub. I have been using it for 4 mos+ and will continue until I can use the larger tub around 8 months, this can also fit into the large tub if you would rather fill this instead of the full tub at that time. I have been happy with this."
5,My First Spa,"As a first-time mom, I was nervous about dealing with a slippery baby, but using this tub has made me much more comfortable. The molded seat really does work as advertised - our baby weighed 7 pounds, 4 ounces at birth and has just about doubled since then, and she has always fit quite nicely with no scary sliding. Since she feels secure, we both enjoy bathtime. Yes, it is enormous, but we store it in the bathtub. And yes, it is a tad expensive, but since it is going to serve for about two years, I thought it was well worth it. I wasn't able to find the Eurotub at our local BRU and was tempted to buy something else instead of ordering it online, but I am glad I didn't."
5,Best tub ever!,"This is, without a doubt, the best baby tub EVER!!!! Don't let the size of it deter you from purchasing it. The design allows for babies of all sizes and ages so you'll get so much more use from it than other tubs. One end comfortably holds your baby so that they can't slip or twist and the other end safely lets your older child sit up and play! We absolutely LOVE this product!!!!"
4,Great tub,I have a deep soaking tub so i needed something that would be a bit larger. This is definitely larger. My infant daughter is still very small for the infant seat but she will grow into the space. I also like that there is a drain in the tub. would have given 5 stars if there was an insert to buy for infants. One of the other reviewers commented to buy no slip pads and this is very helpful. will be very slippery without.
5,Nice for Newborns,"After I read all the reviews here on Amazon, I bought this bathtub right before the baby was born. I had received 3 different baby tubs as gifts and returned them all and I'm glad I did. The baby is now 6 weeks and I can say that it is a well designed tub.Pros: Works great for newborn and the baby can continue to grow into it. The baby feels safe in the built in cradle for smaller babies.Cons: Only downside is it is super big. I have to use it in our kitchen or the master bathroom where we have a large enough counter top. Make sure you have enough counter space to place the tub on. I would not put this in a regular size tub, can't imagine bending over like that is good for anyone's back or knees.Overall: I highly recommend this tub. Baby is happy and safe."
5,AWESOME TUB!,"This is a great tub! A co worker told me about it, and I was hesitant to buy it at first (too costly). But after reading so many positive reviews, I decided to give it a try. Our baby (now 5 months old) is happier and comfortable. I had an inflatable one before (what was I thinking), so I got this one. Get it! It is great!"
3,Could be better,"Although Amazon did an excellent job packaging the tub, it arrived dirty. Considering it came from a warehouse, It's understandable, but considering it's for a BABY, I think they could be a little more generous with the storage of the product. The tub is made out of a plastic type substance that when held in the light looks even dirtier. I think it's just the imperfections in the plastic, but not exactly eye candy.As long as it does it's job, (it's a gift for a baby shower), I am satisfied. I'm not sure if this product comes in other colors, (I bought it in white/pearl) but if it does, I recommend getting one of those instead.Mostly I was concerned with the dirtiness of the product, and if not for that, I wouldn't make such a fuss."
3,Has Good and Bad Traits,"This is a BIG tub, but it works. We put it on the counter between our double sinks so it is easy to use. I bought it because you can use it for newborns as well as toddlers. For small newborns it is not as comfortable, they kind of slide around a bit. I wish there were some kind of gripper for them to lay on, we use a towel so he doesn't slide around as much. It is nice and deep, which is good for boys just in case they pee, it doesn't make it out of the tub. I get annoyed at the plug to drain the water, the pressure of the water flowing through it closes it, so you have to hold it open to drain the water."
3,Not good for young infants,"This tub is VERY VERY large. It is too big to fit in my sink so I must put it on the countertop to bathe my 3 week old or be subject to putting it into my bathtub which is hard on my back. It also has very high sides so it is very difficult to reach into it to bathe him; even though I am 5' 8"". I had a smaller tub for my daughter which fit very well in my sink (sure comfort deluxe) but I had lost the net which is required for a newborn so that's the only reason why I purchased this one (it got very good reviews). I am going to go back to the sure comfort deluxe tub once my son has better control over his movements. I am very suprised that this tub got such great reviews because of the size of it. My son is lost in it."
5,Look Mom - no hands!,"My daughter loves to kick and splash around in this bath. She is now 8 months and we have had this bath since she was born. Although I don't take my eyes off her, I don't have to keep a hand on her (which is good, or I would get extremely wet from her splashing).I have put her in the bigger side a few times. Even though she can sit up fine, it makes me nervous that she will lean forward into the water, so I am keeping her on the reclining side for now.The bath is rather bulky, but we just hang it on the bathroom wall. We are very pleased with the Eurobath and we think you will be too."
4,Great tub!,"I like the tub a lot, my baby who's nine months old (and a big girl) can still use both sides of the tub. I like that it is so big."
2,Too big and uncomfortable,This was too big for our two month old and he was very uncomfortable. His neck is still unstable so I had to hold his neck the entire time while taking a bath rather than it whacking on the hard plastic. Also the protruding centerpiece is a good place to crush a baby's balls so watch out especially if he's too small to fit in the tub properly! I think this tub would be good for older infants or toddlers but not for our two month old. Hopefully in the future we can use it again.
5,The best there is!,"This tub is worth the extra money. Knowing what I know now I would have paid even more. My baby is 4 months and had outgrown the sink. I asked some fellow parents for recomendations and I got great ones for this tub so I bought it. It totally secures baby so I can use both hands to bathe her, which I feel is more safe. Plus, as an added bonus, she loved it! She kicked and splashed for half an hour. It makes the bath enjoyable for her because she can move around while being safe."
5,Found my signature baby shower gift!,"I am the mother of two girls. With my oldest, I tried several different tubs and wasn't happy with any of them. I saw this one and read some of the reviews. I must say it is definetly the best tub out there. My baby is 13 weeks old and she loves to splash around in her tub. The way the tub cradles her while she is in the tub, it is like having an extra set of hands. It is worth the extra shipping charge! I wish I had had this one with my first child."
5,Great Tub!!!!,"This tub is great. It makes bath time so easy, especially when you are bathing a newborn. My daughter is 3 months now and loves bath time now. She has a ball in there, and is not slipping or sliding all over the place. She remains warm since she is in the water all the time. I think this is one of the best gifts that I have received."
5,Great Bath Tub!,"I purchased this tub when my son started to outgrow the one I had gotten at my baby shower (at 2 months). My son loves this one. I feel that he lays in the tub so much better then the other tub I was using. He loves the extra room to splash with. I was worried that it would be too large to put in our bath tub, but it fits just fine. Love it!"
4,Great For Toddlers,"This is a great tub for older babies. I think it is way too large for infants, but great for toddlers. It is a little bulky, but I just store it in the shower and remove it when in use."
5,Must have!!!!,"This is the #1 product I recommend to all mothers-to-be! I love this tub. My daughter use this until she was 23 months old. The design is great! I used the one end for infants where they are reclined about 45 degrees until she could sit on her own, and the other end for the next year and a half! It was so convenient to be able to just put it on top of the kitchen sink and bathe her while standing. Great for bad backs! When I was done I would just pull the drain and walk away. The large size didn't bother me because when not in use, I just hung it in the doorway of the basement. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TUB! IT IS WORTH THE FEW EXTRA BUCKS!"
4,Good Product,"Pros: Solid construction, attractive color, large sizeCons: Baby is too big for infant section and too small for big kid section. She slides around a bit, but she enjoys it."
3,what is all the fuss about?!,"Ok, I know I haven't tried other tubs, but this tub isn't that great!! First of all, it is HUGE!! I have no place to store it and it hardly fits in my bathtub. Secondly, it has no cushion or anti-slip features at all. Thirdly, it is sooooo heavy when you fill it with water that it is difficult for me to fill it and move it from the sink to a table. I guess it is ok, but not five star quality."
3,Primo EuroBath Baby /Toddler Bath Basin,"I bought this for my sister for her baby shower and it's a good product. You can find babies on one end where it's smaller and toddlers on the other end, which is larger. The only drawback is that it is quite large, so unless you have alot of storage space in your bathroom or nearby, it may be a bit of a hindrance. Needless to say, my sis has a very small bathroom so not sure how much use it will get."
4,Good bath for older babies,"We got this bath for our newborn. Unfortunately we weren't able to use it until very recently when she turned 4 m.o. The issue is that the triangle stopper is very wide on newborn side and my girl was crying when we put her in this tub. Even now she prefers to lay her legs on top of the stopper, not around.So for the first 4 months we used the infant bath seat made by the same company that was absolutely great. And the stopper in this seat is much narrower and much more comfortable for a baby."
3,Great Manual for simple off-grid installations,"This manual and the SEI workshops date back to the days before Grid-tie was the norm. Even though the text has been updated through the years, it still has a distinctly off-grid focus. Still, if you want to know a little something about battery banks it's a very good read and pretty thorough. James Dunlop's book (Photovoltaic Systems) is far superior and a must have for anyone who really wants to understand this field and technology.The discussion of wire-sizing in the SEI text needs to be updated and is largely misleading for most modern systems using string fuses."
1,Not very informative,"While this book is full of information, I believe itshould be accompanied with a CD.The information is vast and requires lots of explanation."
3,"Very Technical, Useful in Spots",This book provides a detailed analysis of solar pv. I wonder how many people would really want to understand all of the principles of solar at this depth of detail. As a textbook or reference book this could be used as a great tool.
4,surfercr,The book is 25% full of solar insolation data you will never need and if you did it is on line. It is a waste of paper and the tables short be cut out to reduce size. This is 2011 lets keep data on line.
3,Lite in content and heavy in tables.,"I am interested in designing and installing a DIY solar panel system for our home, so I purchased this book hoping that it would be packed with useful information for realizing such a project. Unfortunately I found it to be rather ""lite"" (if you have done any type of electrical wiring beforehand) and not quite up to date. 80 whole pages are wasted with ""insolation"" tables and ""sun charts"" covering sample locations around the world .. from Alabama to Afghanistan .. an immense waste of space and trees.Otherwise, it is a well organized basic textbook with many worksheets, examples and diagrams.To improve the value of this textbook I recommend that the publisher1) simply includes a link to the ""insolation"" tables available elsewhere on the Web,2) incldues additional and current data on the available component alternatives and a means for evaluating these alternatives in the design process, and3) raises the assumed level of the audience addressed by this textbook."
2,Not much depth,The 70 pages of solar data was a definite waste of paper. I just went to the referenced website and downloaded the data plus additional temperature data for my site so I could better estimate panel derating during the summer. The book mentions the need to derate expected panel performance in several places but doesn't provide the data or worksheets to do this. I also found the discussion on wiring dissimilar modules to be misleading and incomplete. My impression of the book is that is was a compilation of notes from several different instructors and probably makes a good textbook/workbook but definitely falls short of being a good stand-alone installation manual. The best design and installation information I have found is free at the Sandia Labs website (www.sandia.gov/pv). This and other websites and resources are listed in the book. I did learn a few things reading the book and I expect the worksheets may come in handy.
3,"Attachement Parenting is not ""pop psychology""",I am offended by this and that Dr.Willian Sears a quack! Dr. Sears is a pediatrician with years of experience who has studied the effects of AP in his own home. He is not the only one to have studied this either. AP is not meant to cause guilt in parents. There are many ways to do this. You don't have to do everything that AP teaches to feel close to your child. You do what feels right for you.
3,Very warm and spicy,"This is a very strong, spicy cinnamon tea, great for cold days. However, you do need to really like cinnamon to enjoy this tea. I find I have to be in the right mood for it, as it can be overpowering. In contrast, I have a friend who LOVES it, and just bought her 2nd box of 50 bags of this tea. It's well-blended, but it's serious about its cinnamon."
2,"cheap, cheap, cheap","I wasn't expecting super quality but these are below par. The ""belt"" is too flimsy, I took the accessories off and put them on one of my child's dress belts just so it'd be more stable. Overall he is having fun with it but I don't expect that it will last long."
4,Great Halloween and dress up accessory...,Perfect addition to my daughters costume. She loved it! The belt itself is however huge and a bit flimsy. Overall though for the price it worked out great.
1,Horrible quality,"This belt, which is way too big for any toddler, is of very poor quality and has fallen apart after 2 months of use. The plastic handcuffs did not survive one day, and the belt itself has separated at the seams numerous times. I have stapled (!) it back in place repeatedly but even the stapled pieces continue to simply fall apart. My four year old son kindly overlooks the cruddy quality, but even he has given up on this item. Problem is, I can't find any other police belt online - these morons seem to have a monopoly on the police belt business! Order this only if you want a disposable belt and/or you have a toddler with a 46"" waist."
1,policeman's belt a total ripoff,If I could give minus stars I would. This cost over $20 and was worthless. Cheap plastic pieces broke within minutes of being unwrapped. Good news is I found a better one at a DollarTree for $1 and the children are still playing with it.
1,This is a RIP OFF!!,"We ordered this Policeman Belt for our grandsons Halloween costume. He was so excited but when we finally got it in the mail....WHAT A LETDOWN! For starters it was missing everything! There was NO belt, NO flashlight, and NO gun! All the main goods....how disappointing. It is not the fact that we wasted $14 on this non-sense but now there is not much time to find a replacement. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I'm sure you can find better quality somewhere else."
3,Review on Afghan,The story is really good but was not very action packed. Just a normal story based on the Afghan war...Would not call it a thriller...
2,NOT UP TO PREVIOUS,"I found the scenario to be cannily possible---America be warned. However, I didn't LIKE anyone in the book, nor did I feel anything other than a clinical emotion when the main character died or was in trouble. No development of character in this book- and it is strange to read a book without a hero that you like . It is well researched, and believable... but with little ""soul"". Fist of G-d was much better."
3,Good spy novel,"As usual, Frederick Forsyth keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next, although I was extremely disappointed in the ending. I've never felt that way before about a Forsyth book. Most of his fans will probably like the book."
3,"Great story, marred by continuity errors.","Given this book is essentially a sequel to Fist of God, one of my all timne favorite thrillers, it is marred by a large number of continity errors relating to Fist of God. These include:a) Mike Martin's bullet injury - in Fist of God it is stated that he ""picked up his bullet"" in the Falklands. In this book he is supposed to have got it in Africa.b) In Fist of God Martin's brother, Terry is not gay, but ""sharing his life"" with woman (Hilary - I think)c) In Fist of God, Martin was on assignment in the Middle East when recruited to go into Kuwait, not in a Desk Job in LondonOverall, I liked the story, but this careless attention to detail spoilt the book and though Robert Powell is good, I preferred Simon Jones who narrated Fist of God."
3,"Good idea, poor follow through","I found the beginning of the book quite gripping and educational, but as I got further and further into the story, I found myself getting bogged down with longer than necessary Afghan history, long Arabic names and conicidence after coincidence. That an American AF plan could just happen to crash onto a remote cabin was just too much.I am grateful for all those in the USA and GB who work daily to see that attacks such as the one planned in this book never happen. That there are some who are prepared to give their lives for people they never knew and who never knew of their sacrifice, I have no doubt. Some probably already have.The book just needed some shortening and plot reworking. The concept, though, is frightening...."
3,Much flawed in the second half,"Being familiar with the region (both Pakistan and Afghanistan) with numerous visits, I found the first few chapters extremely enchanting and the descriptions authentic. But halfway in the novel (from the faked escape of Martin on his arrival in Begram), so many details were flawed, and really I wasn't able to focus on the story. The conclusion was so dull (precisely as expected) and uninteresting."
4,"Goo book, better than ""ICON"".","Forsyth has been writing good books, but it's a known fat\actor that his best works were written in the seventies.This latest book, at least, is better than ""ICON"", the book that almost made me quit Forsyth."
1,He has lost it completely,"Unbelievably bad. I mean, I was stunned. The Day of the Jackal and the Odessa File are two of the greatest, most expertly plotted suspense thrillers EVER. I hadn't read the guy for 25 years and thought I'd try his latest. I almost didn't even finish it. Thin characters, a ridiculous plot - the whole book is very short and lazy-feeling. He used to be known for the density of his prose.But the worst part was the use of bad tough-guy cliches that sound like a freakin' Ford Truck commercial (""7500 foot-pounds of titanium-jacketed unpleasantness""...that sort of thing). Cliched, lazy, awful - I wanted that 4 hours of my life back (his books used to take a lot longer).Time to retire, Fred."
5,Great workout!!,"If you want a challenging workout, look no more. Whether you want to use it to lose weight or shake out the stress, this workout will help define muscles and strenghten them. I have bought several videos from Cathe and they have worked perfectly for me. I recommend this and other videos from Cathe becasue they really work. And you will sweat like crazy."
2,Disappointing,"First, I am an enormous Julia Fordham fan. I consider her songwriting to be second to none. Her album Porcelain is one of the most sublime pop albums ever crafted IMHO. Unfortunately, this live recording does not hold up. The most disappointing aspect of all unfortunately is Julia's voice. There are serious pitch problems on almost every song on this album. If it were simply an occasional slip up it would not bother me. I found this to be very distracting from the overall enjoyment of the music. The performances are also not very inspiring. I probably will not be listening to this again."
2,"No rhyme, reason, or rationale","Willa Trent ""loves"" her stranger husband who ignores her, rejects her, and has no interest in her. There is no chemistry between the two main characters or even any reasonable premise for them to like each other. I love a farfetched but compelling love story, however, this book would not even entertain a teenager with its unbelievable romantic tension."
3,No Kidding!,"Any Christian should know that Satan is at work in this world, corrupting those he can. What amazes me, are the many, many people that believe they are saved, and are not."
5,Great read,My husband heard about this book on EWTN radio. He eagerly read through it and liked it a lot. He's encouraging my dad to read it now.
5,"superb journal of a doctor who revisits & reevaluates his beliefs, changing his whole practice, sharing his awakening, a gift!","Bought this book for me, am now sharing it with others as I've developed such admiration for this doctor. I do admit wanting to revisit it, dictionary in hand, as he writes well above my literary expertise. He shares his evolution & change of heart after realizing that abortion is unequivocally murder of a living human being. I would have like to have met him, but did not know that he died recently. He lectured nationally & explained his reversal of thinking, remorsefully regretting his former practice. It takes a big person to admit wrongdoing. Rest In Peace, you've done well, Dr. B."
5,This pillow kept me from giving up breastfeeding...,"When my baby was born, I had a hard time nursing. I was tired from labor, drowsy from meds--and dreaded the late-night feedings. I was also a slow learner with breastfeeding positions. The ""My Brest Friend"" pillow was literally my lifesaver. When I strapped it around my waist, I could easily roll my baby in toward me, cradle her in my arms, and keep my hands relatively free to readjust her when she got unlatched. For a 1st-time mom who is planning to breastfeed, the ""My Brest Friend"" pillow could be invaluable."
5,Great for the Motorola E815 mobile phone,"Got my tf card a few weeks back, and I love it. I can store all the pictures and video I take on there, and the card makes them easy to transfer to and from my pc. It also bumped the video recorder from 15 seconds to 3 minutes. Great for storing mp3's on the phone too. I recommend that everyone with a Motorola E815 (or any other compatible phone) pick one of these up immediately."
5,san disk 256 mb transflash memory module for motorola phone,great price. product works as advertised. adapter for the card works flawlessly in both my laptop and desktop machines
2,overly love stories,"The thrilling part of the book it's fairly OK and almost a page turner. But then in the middle of the book start the main sexy love story and when you finish that 50 pages or so and you'll think that the thrilling part is going to begin... Guess what, you'll start a second love story of another 50 pages. So you'll forget about the main plot after you read those loves stories that at least the second one doesn't have to do anything in this book."
5,FLEECE CAMOUFLAGE SLEEPING BAGS,MY FOUR GRANDCHILDREN HAVE ENJOYED SLEEPING WITH THE SLEEPING BAGS EVERY NIGHT SINCE CHRISTMAS. THEY HAVE GONE ON A SLEEP OVER AND EVEN TOOK THE SLEEPING BAGS WITH THEM.
2,Good router if you don't play online games,"Don't get this router if you plan to play online games like ""World of Warcraft"" for example. You'll get frequent disconnection for no reason. Otherwise, the router is great for anything else (downloading large files, browsing, checking e-mail, etc) other than gaming. Gamers, stay away from this router."
2,Port forwarding doesn't work,"I tried setting up a web server behind it using port forwarding, which Belkin claims is working on this model. One out of every 5 http requests *might* get through, and then it wouldn't let any requests through for a while after that. SSH sessions froze after just a short time when connecting from outside as well. I came back to my office after a weekend only to find out the router had lost my internet connection three hours after I left on Friday night, and that was the last straw. I just connected a LinkSys and port forwarding works great on it. This router was a waste of my money, and I won't buy Belkin again."
1,"Awful, horrible, useless, annoying","Cuts out at least once or twice a week, doesnt do port forwarding at all. It does the basic routing (barely) so if thats all you need it for, I might suggest it, but probably not. Go with a Linksys. ( one star is pushing it )"
1,$39 garbage,"just got this installed today, and it was fine for maybe 3 minutes, now it just doesn't send anything. It goes back to the store in a few days. Hopefully I can uninstall the crap software in put on--seems as though i'll have to track down where it is on the computer first...........don't buy this!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Wrong product description,"After 2 bad Linksys routers and many hours on the phone with their tech support and being told that I must have had 2 bad routers from the same batch, I bought the Belkin. I was able to connect to BellSouth in a matter of minutes and so is the 2nd desktop in my office. The 2nd computer is able to connect to my hard drive, but, I cannot connect to it. When I called Belkin, I was told this router is just to connect to the internet, not set up to share files and printers. The product description clearly states ""share files and peripherals."""
5,Still precient,"The other reviews here really help sum up this text, though in some ways the proof is in the application. Read through the theoretical sections of The Mass Psychology of Fascism and then try Googling Reich's name. You will find a number of hysterical appraisals of his work (plus a series of pages wrongly attributing authorship of The Authoritarian Personality to him), many of which display exactly the same rhetorical strategies Reich aligns with fascism: calls for a strengthening of the family; the return of women to the household; a fixation on race; an obsession with the health of the ""mother country."" He was definitely on to something. Even if you don't buy his account of sex economy, he was very alert to the fascist use of metaphors. That alone constitutes a strength of this book."
4,Beautifully recorded SACD,"Pentatone always does an amazing job on all of it's SACD, and this one did not disappoint! Beautiful sound, staging, atmosphere. I would highly recommend this SACD if you want the piano trios. And I would recommend any Pentatone release for any classical piece you are in the market for."
5,Whitney Blanket Storage Bag,"This product is well made, well conceived and is an excellent storage solution."
2,Whitney Design,Whitney Design Cotton Canvas Blanket Storage Bag. Wanted to use it for sweaters but it has no structure.
2,just use a regular garbage can with a lid and empty it often,"I'm a first time mother, got the Diaper Genie while pregnant because it seemed like such a great product, and actually used it for a whole year, all the while assuming that the faint poop smell on the baby's bathroom was inevitable, even using this state-of-the-art, top ten greatest invention known to new moms, system. Then I got a new nanny who refused to deal with the Diaper Genie claiming that she didn't know how to use it, and who just threw soiled diapers in the kitchen trash can. She then empties the kitchen trash can about twice a day (ours is a rather small can with a lid). Hooray!!! Gone is the poop smell in the bathroom, and there is not even a trace of it in the kitchen, since we empty the trash can so often!"
1,The PITS!,"I registered for one of these and got it as a shower gift. While it provides a place to place soiled pampers, it doesn't do much more. Changing the bags can be quite an event. Furthermore, and most importantly, IT ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT CONTAIN ODOR!! No amount of bleach will take the odor away, and I cleaned it every week. My daughter's bedroom consistently wreaked, especially on warmer days. It is just awful. I had to leave it on the porch and take the pampers out as I changed her...what's the point in having it? I am going to try the Diaper Champ and hope I have better luck with it."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"Nothing personal against this particular diaper genie - it's the whole concept that's a waste of time. My husband told me when I was shopping to just buy a metal tin can and put plastic bags in it but I wouldn't listen! I had to have the DIAPER GENIE,so I rcv'd it as a baby shower gift. Not even one month into using it, it broke. It was stinky and complicated to place the trash bags in and out of. Trust me, throw the diapers away in a trash can. Or place the diaper immendiately in a small baggie and then throw AWAY in the trash can. Don't waste your money or a registry item on this."
3,ok...but can live without it.,"It was neat in the begining but now after a few months of changing diapers it is more trouble then it is worth. If you think about it, you are really having to throw out that stinky diaper twice."
1,[BAD]Big Time,"Waste of money, cause you gotta keep buying the refills for it, and there's still some smell. No pail keeps the odors away 100%. I changed it for the Diaper Champ. Now I just use regular shopping bags.........WAY BETTER!!!"
1,This is just plain stinky,"At first I insisted we buy one of these to do the obvious.. eliminate diaper stink! But after putting it together, putting in a refill and dealing with nasty juices and MAGGOTS I wished I would have listened to my husband. I don't recommend anyone waste their time OR money on this thing. Instead go to your local Wal-Mart and buy the diaper pail they have made by Cosco it's only $8.95. It has a foot pedal (excellent for when your holding baby) and you can use regular grocery or small garbage bags in it. Best of all... IT DOESN'T SMELL. We clean ours out 2 times a week (when the bag gets full). Our son's diapers aren't small either, he wears a size 5 and LOVES spicy food (hint). So do yourself or that new Mom a favor and DON'T buy this!"
3,Stinky Genie,"ALL Diaper contraptions smell. Don't buy into the hype that this one prevents the diapers from smelling less. When I empty the thing - most of the wrapped packages come undone, which can be irritating. It took me a month to figure out how to change the darn bag also. After 5 months I am still not doing it right each time. (And I do computer coding...How is it this diaper pail has me searching for the badly written directions all the time?!) My son's messy diapers are VERY messy and since you have to push the diaper or wipes WAY down in there - I'm usually getting muck on my hand. I can see why some like this Genie and others don't but I'm headed back to the store. ONE PLUS: you can find the replacement bags all over the place because it's so popular."
5,A must buy!,"I received this as a shower gift and absolutely love it. It did take a few diapers to figure out how to work it AND the first 3-4 diapers end up lumped together in the first coil, however after you get the weight from those everything works as pictured.I have a 3 month old and need to change it about twice a week, but it's easy to change and the refills last a long time.I have not noticed any odor coming from the Genie except when I open it up and change it . . . but it's not bad and the diaper snake leaves the house immediately after the change.I also have another brand and style of diaper pail that works just as well, but it's wider and takes up a little more room. Also, I was able to find a Diaper Genie cover that matches my nursery set from another store."
1,Stinky Diapers,"Buy the Diaper Champ instead. The Diaper Genie's only redeeming quality is the fact that it closes at the top. Otherwise, it's kind of a pain in the rear. I stick air freshners to it to compensate-I think that says it all."
2,Not Very Sturdy,"I loved the Diaper Genie when I first got it-- after I got the hang of it. The toddler refills controlled odors very well. However, one of the little bag cutters broke off of mine after about 8 months of use. About 2 months later, the entire lid broke off at the hinge. My sister-in-law had the same problem with her lid. I expected this product to last at least through one baby's diaper stage. I was very disappointed in this product."
1,I HATED THIS NUSANCE,"The Diaper Genie is one of the most inconvenient and unsanitary inventions.I was expecting my first child and someone bought me a trash can with a flip up lid that was especially designed to hold in smells. With their approval I returned and got the money and bought a Diaper Genie. I got it home and it was a pain to put the refill in to start with. I was determined to use it though. I used it all of two days. It became such a pain. Even if I changed it it still smelled. It is difficult to change. It was a hassle to use. To me leaving all those diapers in there til it is full is so unsanitary. It is more hassle than it is worth. Go buy Ziploc baggies and throw dirty diapers in those and throw them in the trash. It is less expensive, less hassle, and so much cleaner. I would never reccomend this product to any one. Needless to say I should have just kept the cheap trash can that hold odors."
2,diaper genie review,"It was great in the beginning but after awhile i realized how much of a pain it was. First of all no one but you knows how to use it, when you change the bags and start new, the first few all fall in together. its hard to separate the diapers, when you twist the top it never seals until the 3rd or 4th diaper. Plus ive yet to see it hold odor. Its really more trouble than its worth."
3,"Not Bad, but not a Diaper Champ!","This is fairly simple to use. There are a few drawbacks. You must read the directions to change the refills, otherwise something useful might get thrown away! The refills are expensive after a while. (You go through about 1 every three weeks at $4.95 a pop) If your diaper is big and nasty it will get on your hand trying to get it into ""the Claw"". You have no warning when the refill runs out, so you may have a dirty diaper in your hand and no where to put it. My friend has the diaper champ. It is initially more expensive, but less messy and you can use regular plastic bags. I have noticed no foul odors from either of these products. So, smell to me wasn't an issue."
2,not that great,"I was excited about this product and it seemed great when the babies diapers were tiny and her father emptied it all the time, but i find it to be a MAJOR PAIN and we end up just throwing the diapers in the kitchen trashcan. It does cut down the odor, but the refills are a pain to get, they're very expensive, the container itself is quite small and it's just a pain in the neck to change the bag."
3,Ok but...,"As most new parents, we thought this was a ""must have"" item. I was frustrated with the product from almost day one. It was difficult to use at first due to the lack of directions. We kept cutting the bags when we tried to ""tie off"" the dirty diaper. Once we got that figured out, we were again on the Diaper Genie bandwagon. As a breastfeed baby, dirty diapers weren't really a problem. Now that our son is on solids, the Diaper Genie is smelly. I am constantly disinfecting it trying to get the smell away. The only thing that works for us is a Glade Stick Up which I have put in the inside bottom of the Genie. It has at least slowed down the smell some. It's a good idea but is still needing some work before it is a great product."
5,A Great Item,"This is a very practical item. Twisting it after disposing each diaper really helps to eliminate the stink. Newborn diapers require changing it a couple times a week, but otherwise, it's simple, easy and oderless. I love it."
1,Not worth the price,A friend recommended the diaper genie to us. We liked it until our child's started using bigger diapers. The pail fills to quickly. The smell was still strong. We gave up on the diaper genie and started to use a garbage pail. Why put up with the cost of refills and the hassle of emptying the diaper genie if it does not cut down the smell. We are going to try the diaper champ. I will write a review about that one once we have used it for a while.
3,Not user-friendly,I received a diaper Genie as a gift and I have to say that I had a difficult time with it. I find this product to be very hard to use. I ended up using the trashcan inmy daughter's room as it is faster and easy to clean. I am not impress with this product at all and I will not recommend it.
1,Newer model not nearly as good as original.,"We had an older model Diaper Genie (1994) that was WONDERFUL. We have since had two more children and decided to buy a newer model since the refills for the orginal were being discontinued. The new model has been significantly ""cheapened up."" We threw it in the trash within a matter of a few months and continued to use the old model until we could no longer find the original refills. Save your money."
2,I wouldn't recomment this product,"We bought the Diaper Genie for our daughter because we had heard so much about it.In my opinion, it's a total waste of money and also environmentally problematic. If you empty your trash every day, you don't need the Diaper Genie."
3,"Good, but far from perfect","At first I loved my Genie. The only drawbacks were the cost of the bag cartridges and learning to use it. Since I could usually find decent prices on cartidges and eventually figured it out, I really loved it for about a year. After 2 years, I think I would choose a different product. Over time, as my child's diapers have become stinkier so has the Genie. The smell is absorbed into the plastic and impossible to remove. It's tough to throw out a large... contraption with so many pieces. Luckily, a baking soda refrigerator box helps a little."
2,Waste of money!,"I bought this because I thought ""I have to have one."" It has been the most aggravating thing I have ever used! You twist and sometimes it twists and sometimes it doesn't and it doesn't take away odor, etc.... I heard the diaper champ is much better,or better yet, just dispose of the diapers immediately and dont buy this at all. I have a whole stack of refills that are sitting on the closet shelf."
1,Don't waste your money,"I received this diaper pail as a shower gift, I did not register for it however I figured I'd give it a try...what a MISTAKE!!!! Not only do the diapers jam in the top when trying to place them inside, the bags that are suppose to contain the diapers completely rip to shreds. My husband had a very hard time emptying the diaper pail because the diapers where so jammed. We gave up on this item after the first two weeks of use. I know a few other expecting mothers and I plan on telling them not to bother putting this product on their registry."
4,LOVE IT,The Diaper Genie is sooo easy to use and they always have coupons on refills. I love it.. Even my husband can use it lolol... u just pop a diaper in til u feel the grabber thingys and then close it and twist the lid and it locks in the diaper... I can keep it next to the changing table and know my son can't get into it and won't smell his nasty poopies..
1,It STINKS!,"No matter what you do - IT STINKS! Especially when your baby starts solids. And I, personally, don't like the idea of pushing the diaper through, then twisting it and inhaling all the odors while doing it."
1,WORST PRODUCT EVER!!!!,"I would have never invested in this product if I would have asked around first. This product has good intentions, but doesn't deliver. The diaper genie wouldn't wrap the diapers. They would just rip the plastic and fall to the bottom. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone!!"
2,waste of money,"This was a gift, and according to EVERYBODY, a must. However, after four months of use, it became a hassle, and a major pain. I had to empty it every other day, and it still smells. If I messed up on emptying it, I ended up throwing away the whole refill. At four dollars a refill, every other week, not worth it. I would rather smell it. I empty trash every day anyways."
1,Do yourself a favor and DON'T BUY THIS!!!,"We received our Diaper Genie as a shower gift and at first we were delighted to have it. Until we actually started to use it. It only holds about a day's worth of diapers so you end up changing it all the time. Also, it is designed to wrap each diaper individually, (kind of like a sausage link) but it doesn't really work. Our lid broke within the first month of using it. It is also really short and not convienent to use since you have to bend way over while trying to make sure your baby doesn't roll off the changing table.We ended up buying ourselves the Diaper Champ. It is so much easier to use and holds a lot more diapers. It's design is so much easier and simple. Do yourself a favor and get the Diaper Champ... you wont regret it."
1,Glad I finally threw this out!!,"This Diaper Genie was great at first. But, as time went on, it smelled baaaaad! Everytime I opened it I got blasted with ""diaper stink"" even when there were no diapers in it!I threw it out and went to tossing the diaper's into those plastic (and free) grocery store bags and tying up the handles. I didn't have ""diaper stink"" problems ever again!Also, the twisting action didn't always work. When it came time to cut the bag, it would fail most of the time.I will NEVER buy the Diaper Genie or recommend it to anyone ever again!!"
2,Not worth the hassle.,"We bought a diaper genie when our first son was born in 1999. We heard other parents talk about how nice they were. Well, we didn't like it. The refills are a pain to put in. The lid didn't twist like it was supposed to. I usually had to get my husband to help me. When you empty the genie, the smell is awful and the diapers just ""untwisted"" in their wrap. I would advise against buying this thing."
3,It works for smell BUT...,The diaper genie does work for not smelling diapers!BUT...It takes time to learn how to put the bags in.The bags last longer than I thought they would.It fills up fast so you need to empty it often.I do not like that it opens from the bottom to get the bag out.You stick your whole hand up the thing.Which is gross!It could be improved.
3,Nice idea but the Diaper Dekor is better,We received the Diaper Genie as a shower gift and were not impressed. The smell was aweful and we had to fight with it to get the ring to turn. After a week of frustration I went out and bought a Diaper Dekor Plus. I'll admit that the smell isn't pleasant when you change the bag but it is a lot easier than the Diaper Genie. Another nice feature of the Dekor is you can keep one hand on the baby and use your foot to open the container to dispose of the diaper unlike the Genie. Spend a little more and make your life easier!
4,Pretty good product,"It is true, the diaper genie does stop your room from smelling like dirty diapers - but my one complaint is that no matter how much I try to air out the inside of the genie and spray with lysol and deodorizer, I still can't get the smell out and it makes having to empty the genie a clothespin-on-the-nose job."
2,Piece of junk,I would rather throw the diapers on our kitchen trash can. It's a lot faster and easier than trying to mess with the Genie. I would recommend trying a different brand.
4,Great product if you know how to follow instructions!,"I have read the negative reviews of this product and find that many people seem to complain about the basic functionality of the Diaper Genie. I, too, was somewhat frustrated when first trying to use my Diaper Genie -- then I READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! It is so simple to use once you read the instructions on how to use it correctly. Yes, you do have to empty it at least every other day (if not daily), but I personally don't want to leave messy diapers in my baby's nursery for more than 2 days anyway!I now have streamlined my use of the Diaper Genie so that only the ""messy"" diapers go in it and the diapers that are simply wet go in the trash can. This saves me $$ on refills and I only have to empty it every other day! And the best part of all is my baby's nursery has no stinky odor at all! I have friends who use other diaper ""pails"" and their nurseries do have an odor (they just don't notice it as much I guess). Overall this is a wonderful product!"
1,just threw my genie out!,"Using the Diaper Genie is a major hassle. The refills are expensive, and changing them is difficult--I can never get the plastic ring to snap on correctly. Emptying the thing is a major pain, too, as the cutter does not always work properly. And I hate pushing the dirty diaper through the opening. I just tossed my Genie in the garbage. Now I'm using very thin scented bags from the dollar store and just taking out the diapers in a small trash bag at the end of the day."
1,most frustrating thing ever!,"I don't know if I just haven't figured this thing out yet or what, but I just can't get the hang of it. At first it seemed to work ok. About every third diaper would work fine, now all it does is slice the bag open. It's been more trouble than anything, and if it doesn't work after we use up the refills, I'm giving up. Simply putting the diapers in a plastic bag and throwing it in the dumpster is easier than dealing with [diaper container]!"
1,not happy with diaper genie,"I do not like the diaper genie at all. I found it to be very uneasy to use. It also has an awful odor, which the adds for it claim it does not smell. I have since purchased the Diaper Champ which is much easier to use and does not have the awful smell of the diaper genie."
3,"Nice, but a waste of plastic & time","This is a great concept & nice to use...at first. However, as your baby gets over the size 2 diapers, you have to empty it much earlier than before. Plus the larger the diapers, the harder it is to stuff it in the diaper genie. We just went back to plastic grocery bags, tied off when not used & tossed them into the garbage can with less effort than the diaper genie."
2,Not the greatest,"It took us about 10 diaper changes to realize we were turning the part that cuts the plastic, not twists it. I have at least 5 friends who did the same thing. I think it's a pain to change the refill too. When we ran out of refills I stopped using it. I does keep the smell down with the lid closed. I think it's just as easy to throw #1 diapers in the trash and tie poopy diapers in a plastic shopping bag and throw them in the trash outside."
3,"Smells good, doesn't work as well as advertised.","The diaper geenie would be wonderful if it actually worked like it is supposed to. The refills smell good - THEY ARE SCENTED PEOPLE!Everytime I empty the thing the first few diapers don't stay sealed. I put the first diaper in and twist the DG probably 3-4 times and every time the first 2-4 diapers come unraveled until they sit deep enough to touch the bottom. The instructions say to twist extra for the first few but they always come unravelled no matter how many times I try to seal the diaper. It drives me crazy. If I could get that part fixed, the Diaper Geenie would be a dream come true."
4,36 Inch Premium Round Blue IDE Review,"This 36 Inch Premium Round Blue IDE is nice, but it needs the Middle Connector located closer to the Hard Drive End of the Cable.The Middle connector should be located about 3 inches near the end inorder for the hard drives to be connected in a Full Tower Case.Otherwise it's a very nice long hard drive cable and works great."
4,davidglincman,this is a great documentary on the life and times of hg Wells which inspired orson wells and george pal ln giving us the 1953 classic the war of the worlds lf you would like to know the secrets about the man watch the documentary
2,struts are making noise,"installed both struts, after a few 100 miles one of them is making noise like a rubbing sound. Like the seal is dry. Not sure if these are really Monroe struts. The box says so but nowhere on the product do they say monroe or a part number. Just might be cheap junk switched out, I have no way of knowing. Not happy,"
2,Extremely Disappointed --- in Amazon,"The movie was great to a point. My husband had seen it before and really liked it. However, the end was cut off on the DVD we ordered and were EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with Amazon with the quality of the movie due to the end was missing. This was my first bad experience with Amazon and am reluctant to order again because of this experience."
5,Great cable,"The cable works as advertised. I was able to hook into component and switch the resolution on my Wii. I did see a noticable improvement in picture quality.Update: Sorry, I'd mistakenly voted 1 star (didn't even know I'd done that). Corrected now. Still using the cable."
4,Great but...,Still getting use to the product. The price is nice on this item. It seems to improve the quality of the image. Hard to tell sometimes. But overall it's seems worth having.
4,Works as intended,"The cables work just fine for what they are meant to do. I did not see any difference in video quality going from 480i to 480p, nor did I expect to see any."
4,Not neccessarily needed but works great,This product does exactly what it says gives you a 480p connection which is great for those of us that play on hdtvs instead of widening the screens via the tv. But really it doesn't do much the graphics do come out a little sharper and obviously less stretched out. So in my opinion it was well worth the money I spent and works just as good as the 1st paty would and saves money so I would recommend to those who play on hdtvs but don't expect much out of it.
3,Not worth the money,"It works fine, though I cannot see any significant difference from the original one. I don't think I would buy it again, I don't think it's worth the money."
5,Great product,"The HD link does make the picture much better, also really helps the picture if you get netflix thru the wii!"
3,Works but whats the point?,"I brought htis home and hooked it up to a brand new LCD 46"" 1080 TV and I originally had the composite cables in. I changed it to this one and set the Wii to the HD and barely notice a difference. I really don't think its somethignw rong with the cable. I think thats the best the Wii has. Component cable really isn't necessary but if you want a slight increase in color depth pick it up."
1,HD Component Cable Real Performance,"I have a Pioneer Elite 53"" 1080i TV that is connected to my Wii. I tried the cable that came with the system which is only composite. This cable is towards the bottom of the food chain in terms of audio/video quality. The video quality was fair, but not really that good with lots of jagged lines. I have 3 other high quality component video cables (Tivo, PS3, Netgear EVA8000) and the picture is great. Of course, these devices support 1080i/p. The Wii only can support 480p so you are not really getting what I would classify as HD such as 720p, 1080i or 1080p.The bottom line is I do not see any difference between the free cable that comes with the Wii and this NYKO HD Link Component Cable. I don't know if a better quality Component Cable would display a better picture (possibly), but this is not worth the money."
1,NYKO HD-LINK,Wii HD Link Component CableThe cable was bad directly out of the box. The blue channel does not work at all so there is no blue on the screen. Funny color to be absent since it is a primary color on the wii dashboard. Also the picture is very bad. A little static in the background. My Standard cables are way better.
2,Doesn't fit on new LED TVs!,"The cables worked well on my Samsung 40"" LCD, then I bought a new Samsung 55"" LED and the plugs are too big! I had to go back to using the RCA cables that came with my Wii. It's really Nintendo's fault for not having an HDMI port (regardless of the Wii's max resolution being 480p)."
4,HD Link for Wii,"It seems to work alright. Things seem a little brighter and clearer, but not a whole lot. If you play games all the time then you should get this, If you don't care about what it looks like and just want to play then don't get this. It is that simple."
2,Poor quality,"I know that the Wii does not give you a true HD signal, so this is not about that. The cable worked fine for about one year, but then one day it started creating lines, artifacts, and had audio problems. Connected the original low-res cable and everything works fine. We rarely ever move our Wii. Now I'm looking for a different brand especially since we had a similar cable failure with a Nyko charger."
5,Needed it,Needed it - all cables worked. Good buy for the money. Easy to use easy to install. had it up and running in minutes
4,"Not HD quality, but...","I don't know too much about resolution and how it works. I do know that the graphics with the Nyko HD Link doesnt compare to anything that uses an HDMI. But there is a difference with these cords, the graphics are less blurry. At first, I couldn't tell the difference and thought it was a waste, but when I went to play on my friend's Wii (who has the same tv as me) there was a bit of a blur. So I am still happy with my purchase."
3,Compression short boys,"Got these for my son to use under jeans and other pants. He says they are great. So far they are a few weeks old, have been washed a few times, and holding up well."
2,Not That Good At All,"I would be fine with this album for being different, but the songs just aren't that good. The two best songs on the album are ""Hold On"" and ""Kiss"". ""Evolution"" is supposed to be the headlining song for the album, but is just okay. The album just feels rushed. Don't know how true that is, but even if it wasn't, it sounds that way. The only song on the album that sounds like KoRn is ""Hold On"". That is a very strong song and about the only one play from this album. Needless to say, this gets skipped a lot on my iPod. I'd say the worst album by the band, but luckily they got better with the next album. Every band is entitled to a bad album every now and then, and this is theirs."
3,Not Great. But Good,"I am old school Korn fan, and I love all their older records from their debut album to Untouchables. I can't stand SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE. I personally think that after Head left they panicked and released a record that would appeal to everyone, but in reality it had no creativity, it just sucked. After that album, I didn't have much hope for them anymore, but this new cd is really pretty good. I like about half the songs on the album and I think they are headed in the right direction. Its so much different than anything I've heard from Korn and thankfully it sounds nothing like SYOTOS."
2,"TIME TO GO, KORN...","I think this KORN should be the last Korn album, by the fact that is ABSOLUTELY CLEAR that the style of Korn's songs became totally repetitive and redundant...I mean, the lyrics are becoming more and more uninspired and depressing and the songs seems without sense...The first 3 or 4 Korn albuns are good, but it's more than time to Korn say goodbye or only exists to play live shows, because since ISSUES all the stuff they created is not really interesting..."
4,Amazing Recording Technology,"'See You On The Otherside' was the first album without Head, and it sold more than 'Untouchables' and 'Take A Look in the Mirror' combined....and now they use instruments and incredible recording technology not seen anywhere else!I really hope the people that gave this album 1 star downloaded the leak and listened to it all the way through and not just picked it up this morning.The deluxe package is amazing and the first one I have ever forked over the extra cash for. If you watch the ""making of"" dvd you will see how much work went into this record. Terry Bozzio has a 50 piece drum kit!! The art is absolutely amazing and the coolest seen on any previous Korn release, except Todd McFarlane of course.Very cool dark progressive album, people wanting another 'Life Is Peachy' should just listen to those albums and move on."
4,grows on you,"i was confused at first but i like this album.the sad thing is if they keep it the same it gets boring, if they change it up people say they sold out. just listen and enjoy"
3,Hold On,"After first listen I was unimpressed and overall disinterested in the album. Didn't attempt to listen again for quite awhile. As of late I have listened to this album quite frequently and have grown to enjoy quite a number of songs. It does not compare to Korn, Life is Peachy, Freak on a Leash, Issues, and Take a Look in the Mirror but Untitled is a fairly decent album. I'd say definitely an improvement over their previous release See You On The Other Side."
5,"Superb Mystery, subtle wit and a good history lesson as well","In ""A Murder on the Appian Way"", Saylor takes the reader on a ride through some turbulent times in Rome, using his subtle humor and wit to a most satisfying conclusion. In this novel, Rome is the battleground for the rival gangs of the populist politician Publius Clodius, and his political enemy Titus Milos. Clodius is murdered on the Appian Way under mysterious circumstances and Milo is accused of the crime. The city explodes and the skills of Gordianus the Finder and his unique family are brought out to expose the truth -- which just possibly is not what anyone wants to know! A most compelling addition to Saylor's continuing Roma Sub Rosa series"
3,Cheap,"This product is cheap. It works beautifully for what it is. However, the motor is way too loud, and the construction of the DVD player itself is very fragile.If your looking for a good cheap dvd player this might meet your needs, but if you have the money you should definately go with something that is better built and not as loud."
4,Just what ive expected......,Nice image quality.... Grate improving on resolution of dvd movies ( on HD ). Good Price.
5,Very pleased - outstanding product,Picture quality great!!! Especially for the money. Easy to convert to Multi-regional (using the directions another reviewer wrote).Definitely highly recommend this player to anyone wanting HD for least amount possible.
1,Quite disappointed,"I have been using amazon for a few years now, buying all sorts of things from it. I bought this dvd player expecting it to be great value for a good price. It worked really well for a month or two. After that, it just stopped working. It would say 'no disc' no matter what disk I put in. By the time I realized the problem, it was too late to return. Now I have a beautiful, non-working dvd player. Please research more before buying this product."
1,Awful quality,"I've had literally 3 of these routers in the last three weeks, and all of them have broken. The first burned up while routing Trex with a 3/4 pattern bit. I bought a new one, figuring that the first one was my fault. The switch failed about 30 seconds into my first cut. Sent that one back to Amazon (got good service from them), they shipped me a third one. Got that, finally finished my project, but when I got home I discovered that the speed control dial had broken off. Its an incredibly flimsy part. Sent that one back to Amazon as well, am getting another one since its free due to warranty and such. Router works well when its working, but that pretty rare."
3,Not good if you have a cordless phone or live by an airport,"While I generally like this monitor, there are times I want to throw it out the door. It picks up all noises in our daughter's nursery, but it also picks up our neighbors conversations on their cordless phones. No kidding. I can't talk on my own cordless phone and have this monitor next to me. Too much static. We also live in the path of an airfield, so the monitor has annoying static from the planes. (Sunday evenings are the worst, because of the heavy air traffic.) I guess it's best for those in the country... not a highly populated city."
1,Absolutely maddening.,"This monitor worked fine for the first few days I had it; then it began making almost constant noise. Sometimes it's OK during the late morning and early afternoon, but the rest of the time it makes a loud, rhythmic buzzing/beeping every five seconds or so (even in the middle of the night, which is when I really want the thing to work). Often there's a fuzzy buzzing in between the beeps. It's loud enough to wake me up and loud enough to obscure baby sounds. I'm certainly not going to replace my phone just to see if that helps, since that would cost even more than this monitor did. Hopefully I can still return it and try something else."
2,Not a good experience,"The positive: The monitor is certainly sensitive. I could hear my son's breathing and little sighs easily with the monitor on 4.The negatives: There was static from the thing--always. Also, on random nights we would hear odd little blips about 2 seconds apart. Did I try turning off appliances, etc.? Yes. Did I move the monitor to different locations? Yep. In addition to being curious about what was causing these sounds, I never could figure out the reason why the blip happened on some nights and not on others.Also, I recently discovered that if I changed the channel my husband and I were treated to the goings-on of little ""Jackie"" and his parents, who apparently live somewhere in our neighborhood. I really do hope that they weren't able to listen in to us. The final straw was the loud interference the monitor would emit when I turned on a fan in my son's room. Again, this was a recent discovery.I returned the thing today and bought a Graco model. So far, so good."
1,WANT TO GET EXTREMELY ANNOYED? BUY THIS!!,"And I am not kidding either! This was top rated monitor in a baby book rating baby products, so, we got it. BIG mistake! When in use, every 2 seconds (yes I timed it) it beeps this annoying beep that makes you want to thow it to the ground and stomp on it. Better yet, I rather throw it out into the street and run it over with my SUV. Plus they call it ""crisp and clear""?? They got to be kidding me. The thing was a static machine. After researching, I am not the only one who had this problem with the 2 second beeping from the base. I got [a different brand monitor] and I absoultely love it!! I can hear my baby breathe which is so comoforting and every little sigh he makes. And no beeping!! No static!... So.. my advice.... DONT get this monitor!! Save your sanity. More money doesn't mean better qaulity in this case. Dont buy this!!"
3,No Static Here,"I can't argue with the legions of reviewers who have complained about static, I can only recount my experiences.I have had great success in having a clear channel to listen to our baby. The statice has been ranging from non-existent to minimal. The sensitivity of the monitor has been very good.Again, I can't argue with other experiences with this monitor. I think the static issue is a fact-specific issue. For some reason, some people experience static, while others do not. Try it, and see how your experience is."
2,Greatly disappointed,"This is the first monitor we had purchased. We had horrible problems with static more times than not. We are expecting our second child and a new baby monitor was one of the first items on my shopping list. For the cost, I was highly disappointed with this product's performance."
2,Too Much Interference!,"We've used this monitor since my son was born 18 months ago. For the first year we were very happy with it and didn't mind the occasional static. For the last six months, we have been dealing with more and more feedback from the monitor, and I'm getting tired of sleeping in the guest room so that I can hear my baby and not squeaks and beeps from the monitor all night long. Needless to say, we are now shopping for a new monitor!"
1,Too bad,buzz buzz blip blip... congratulations on having a rhythm to static and beeps. I bought it for the rechargable batteries and 900MGz. My old basic Fisher Price is much better. That's what I get for trying to improve on a good thing! This monitor is being returned tomorrow morning.
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money With This One,"Got this monitor as a baby shower gift and was very disappointed when I tried it out for the first time. All I got was static and constanting buzzes and bleeps. I couldn't hear my daughter at all and had to keep the monitor turned off. The following week I went back to the store and bought the Fisher-Price Sounds 'n Lights baby monitor and love it! My husband and I run a lot of computer equipment and have had no problems so far. The Fisher Price monitor, which came with dual receivers and was still cheaper than this First Years model. I would definitely NOT recommend this monitor!"
4,Very Clear - Very Sensitive Monitor,This product works very well in our home (we have multiple cordless phones). It is extremely sensitive though and we originally made the mistake of placing it too close to the crib. Because of the sensitivity we picked up every breath and baby gurgle- making it hard for us to sleep. After making some adjustments we have found it works great.
2,Lots of static,My husband and I found this product not helpful at all. There was lots of static and not a very good range for this monitor.
5,Good monitor for 1200 sq. ft apartment,I bought the baby monitor because we could not hear the baby cry from our room like we did in former apartment. We purchased it and we have been very happy with it. I like the clarity of it. We are able to turn it up loud enough and hear her breathe if we want to. We like to hear her play when we are not in the room.We can take it in other rooms of the apartment if we choose. Great for my husband who works from home or for me if I want to take a nap when she is sleeping. She has become my alarm clock. We are very happy with the product.
2,They shrink!,"We bought the Simmons changing pad and the Simmons covers to go with the pad. After one wash the cover shrunk and now doesn't fit. I have to bend the pad in half just to get the cover on and then it doesn't even fit right. I've given up on the terry cloth covers and now use the new disposable cloth-like covers instead. They work wonderful and there's nothing to wash! Don't waste your money on these terry cloth covers....not worth it, unless you have a very small changing pad!"
3,Good. Not Great,"They didn't shrink (much) or fray during the first wash, but like a previous reviewer stated - they feel like cheap towels. I'm not impressed.If they fray at all once the baby comes, I'll pitch them. It's too bad they aren't inexpensive enough to be tossaways, because that's all they really are."
1,I hate this cover,"As a shower gift I received this cover as well as one by Tykes that is no longer available through Babies r us. Well, I was shocked to find that a product by Simmons - the same manufacturer of my changing pad does not fit the pad. I can only assume they did not preshrink the fabric. The Tykes ones fit beautifully. My advice - don't waste your money on this product."
1,Useless,"I can't believe how much this shrunk once it was washed! It never made it to the changing table. You would think the makers of this would know that every item that is going to touch a baby is going to be washed. Therefore, have the material be pre-shrunk before marketing it."
3,Not As Soft As I Would've Liked,"We purchased one of these when we started decorating the room for our expectant daughter. I liked how there was several colors to choose from so that I could coordinate with her nursery. The terry cloth wasn't as soft as I thought it would be, but it wasn't too bad. I just saw that they now have chenille ones. I think I might give one a try. When our daughter was born, we ended up buying two more. I advise all new parents to purchase 3 covers: one on the table, on in the laundry and one in the drawer. The first time I washed them (on the gentle cycle and cold dry), they shrank, however, it still fit the pad. We have now had ours for over 3 months and they have not fallen apart as some other reviewers' have. They are pretty absorbent and do their job. Overall, you get what you pay for."
1,A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!,"I am a first time mom, and I registered for the Simmons changing pad & 1 cover. I received both as gifts and imagine my shock and disbelief when I found out that the Simmons cover doesn't fit the Simmons changing pad!! Even before washing, the cover was too tight and after wash it got even worse. I bought 2 more colors thinking maybe they would fit better. I completely wasted my money!! Simmons better do the math and figure out the correct measurements for their own pad.Anyway, I called my friend that also just had a baby and she told me she had the same problem. Then she told me about a stretch terry cover that's made by Especially for Baby which fit perfect!! Buy that product instead and you'll actually have a changing pad cover that fits your changing pad!!"
4,"Good covers, but don't get used much","These covers are very comfy and the fit is pretty decent (in my opinion). However, I don't really use them much. I found out pretty early on that it's easier to just change my son on the uncovered changing pad because he is constantly spitting up, urinating and pooping on the pad. I was having to wash the covers every day! Now I just bring them out when we have visitors (like the fine linens, ha ha!)"
1,Mahalia Jackson DVD,"The sound (the reason I ordered the item) is pretty bad, seemingly a monaural track. If that is of lesser importance the 2 disc Video is o.k.I regret having ordered the thing."
4,Very good production,"Visually this is very fine. The sets are slightly minimalist and effective.Costumes appear appropriate. The lighting is interesting. I find the actingto be very good.What I hear is also very fine. The orchestral score is just exceptional. Maybesome of the best music Birtwisle has ever written and he has written a lot offine music. The singing is of a high standard mostly. Ariadne has more vibratothen I like. Everyone else sounded just fine to me.The filming struck me as good. I have nothing to compare this DVD to so it is hardto decide between 4 and 5 stars.As a side, Unlike one reviewer I found plenty of drama in this opera. Over a halfdozen people are killed just in Part 1!"
2,Big disappointment,I was very disappointed. The quality of sound is very poor. It is extemely hard to make out what the speaker is saying. I gave up 15 minutes into the 1st CD and have not gone back. It sounded as if it was a copy of a cassette and bad one at that. :(
5,Steering Wheel Cover,"When I saw it on line, I thought it was perfect, but when I opened the box, and got to look at it in person, it was so much better! I love it!!"
5,Very good cd!,"Yes, this cd is a great selection of songs, you will listen Tommy plays acoustic versions of songs of James gang, and others great songs."
3,"Beware, this item is HEAVY for its size","We drink a lot of loose tea with dinner and wanted a good size teapot. I could not believe how heavy this is, heavier than a metal teapot we have that is slightly larger. After putting water in, it would be even heavier. The reason is that it is made of stoneware. I sent it back, because the product description did not mention stoneware. Because we didn't use it, I cannot comment on its features. I gave it 3 stars because most people seem to like it."
2,"Another Quickie ""Thriller""","If you're sitting in an airport or on the beach and need a distraction, go ahead and buy this book. But it really is a waste of time. The characters are flat, the plot is far less than thrilling and even the word craft is less than expected from this author (hey - does the President's 11-year-old daughter have to repeatedly 'flounce' out of the room?) Much like Tom Clancy has opted to put his name on second-rate books that he didn't write, Edge Of Honor seems to be a book that was quickly slapped together, relying on character development originated in previous novels.This is a waste of time & money."
3,Wish it would have gone a little more indepth,"I really liked this book and could relate to much of it. However, I wish the author would have spent more time dealing with the reasons women have self-esteem issues in the first place and what happens to us if we do cross that line to adultery. Even though I know it is a Christian book, I also wish the author would have shown other ways of dealing with issues. For example, if I was not Christian and had read the book, I would have hoped that she would have made mention of a good counselor (not necessarily Christian), self-help groups, or the possibility of anxiety and/or depression issues. Not everyone who reads this book will embrace the concept that all a woman needs is a relationship with Jesus and all of her problems will be solved."
4,Very pretty,"This is a very pretty bracelet. It was much wider than I thought it would be, but still looks quite elegant.My friends thought I bought it at an ""expensive"" jewelry store."
2,I got love for Da Twelve BUT...,"This song is NOT THEM. It totally does not fit their persona. I was disappointed to hear this as their first single after their long hiatus from the spotlight. Now, they're not even in the spotlight. I've been following 112 since 1996 and this is not the 112 I fell in love with. I still bought their album ""Hot & Wet"" and let me just say that 112 could have picked a better song to release as their first single from the new album... Any song but this one. Skip out on this single and just buy the album. There's way more better songs on there. Even ""To The Crib"" didn't make it to the final cut of the CD cuz the song is garbage! Please believe me when I say I am a 112 fan, it's just that I'm sooooooo not feeling this horrible wannabe-reggae song."
5,Came in handy for all sorts of scenarios you'll enounter...,"I travelled alone in Italy for one week, and this little book was so helpful...referenced it again and again during my visit. It came in handy for practical situations travelers always encounter...directions, menu verbiage, and basic conversation with locals.It also helped in more specific situations...for women traveling, this will help you formulate quick responses to the ""ciao bellas"" you'll receive. Bene!"
1,They Don't Work but are helpful when you need to BREAK IN!!!,"These are complete garbage. I bought 2 and found the same thing others did. They have to be pointed directly at the sun to even operate and you can't have ANY tint to your windows. My son's came in real handy when he called AAA when he locked his keys in his car. The AAA driver said ""You may as well hang a break into me sign on the car as that thing."" He proceeded to remove the rubber with his finger and opened the door with a stick! No special equipment needed to break into your car with these worthless pieces of junk. I trashed them. Amazon forces you to give it at least one star. I Protest!!! This is my first 0 star review"
5,Excellent Monitor!!,"This is an excellent monitor, especially for the money. It is very sensitive. I can hear any moves my daughter makes or breathing at night since it is very clear. I have had no problems with it whatsoever. I feel it is very reliable. I had a more expensive model and it did not work nearly as well. I highly recommend this."
1,Price the only redeeming factor,"Except for the fact that this is priced really low, I could not find any other reason for getting this monitor. It was a good thing that we got it as a gift. After using it, we thought of keeping our Fisher Price monitor in the registry.Some of the problems with this monitor are:- generally flimsy construction.- lack of a clip or a flat base on both receiver and monitor. Makes it really difficult to place it somewhere.- because of the level of white noise you have to keep the volume up quite high- since there is no visual indicator of the noise level, you have no option but to listen to the hissing and strain hard to hear if it was your baby crying.I think the Fisher Price models are a much better option."
2,Bad interferiance,"I got this product as a baby shower gift because it had the ""extended range of 400 feet"" so I could easily walk my dog while the baby was sleeping in the apartment. But I cant get past the front door with out the thing going static crazy and buzzing!! Also at night when my 7 month old daughter is sleeping the reciever in my bedroom lets out this squeal that makes you turn it off and back on for it to go away. Also only one channel works. Dont even spent the money (little that it is) to get this product. You will loose sleep, not get the security and sound sleep you need..."
2,No batteries on baby unit,"I bought these monitors because I wanted a portable, battery-operated option for travel outside the United States where the electrical currency is different and using AC adaptors would require an additional gadget. It turns out the baby unit doesn't take batteries and can only be used with the AC adapter -- which pretty much defeats my purpose. This wasn't clear on the packaging, which marketed the adapters as accessories."
2,Annoying Background Noise,"I bought this product looking as lot of +ve reviews. Just on opening the package and putting Base unit beside Baby Crib and other unit in living room (just 10 feet from kids room), I started getting background noise. On reducing distance b/w Base unit and other unit this sound goes away. Tried placing in different rooms and changing both bands but the background noise keeps coming on increasing distance greater then 10 feet. This noise was pretty annoying, hence immediately returned the equipment back. If this background noise is not there, then it is OK equipment as the base unit picks up baby or any small noise pretty well."
2,"It works it's purpose, with unstandable static and the construction is crap.","We bought this because we wanted something really cheap. Well, you get what you pay for! Basically It works its purpose but the static is unstandable. It even wakes up the baby at times when the receiver is on the other side of the house. It interferes with everything electric in the house, even when put close to a light switch. Don't drop it, it will break in little pieces.Even too expensive for the quality. It should be worth just under $5. It works, with lots of static and it's crap. If you don't mine, then buy it.You will hear your baby."
2,Interference from wireless router,"We bought this monitor and could only hear the louder sounds our daughter made over a droning buzz that varied in volume depending on where we set down the receiver. The instruction manual listed the company's product support number, so we called. A very helpful operator immediately asked if we had wireless Internet. We told her we did and she said that was likely the problemIn order to get a clear signal with the wireless router running, we would have to purchase a >900 MHz digital monitor. As we spend a lot of time near our computers, we opted to return the unit and get another one."
1,Not awesome,I ordered this becasue it got so many good reviews for such an inexpensive monitore and i HATE it. It kept buzzing all night long and kept my husband and I awake. Not woth the time I spent ordering it and returning it.
2,didn't work right from the box,"I had to return this item because it didn't work right from the start. It made very loud static and if someone talked or cried, it would only change the sound of the static slightly. I really wanted it to work too- it had all the features that I needed and I loved the price. I didn't try a second one since I really needed a monitor and didn't have the time to mess around with something that might not work."
5,Perfect pitch,Used this monitor to be able to help spouse when he was having difficulty.. Worked perfectly and the sound was very clear. Great buy.
2,"Not Worth It, Even At This Price","We needed a second monitor for occasional use and I was hoping to get away with buying something inexpensive. This monitor does have a great price and I wasn't looking for a lot of bells and whistles. Unfortunately when the base unit was two rooms away I still got feedback on the parent unit. The two units were at least 30 feet apart and had three walls between them. This unit does not offer sound activation; you only get only continuous broadcasting. I would have also liked to see a built-in battery in the parent unit that can be charged instead of needing a 9 volt battery to operate (even AA or AAA would have been more convenient).On the plus side, it picks up sounds like anything: my other child who was talking pretty quietly even farther away from the base unit could easily be heard on the parent unit.Pros: great price, picks up sound amazingly wellCons: feedback even at great distance, only continuous broadcasting, no built-in battery on parent unit"
2,AN OK MONITOR UNTIL THE ELECTRICITY GOES OFF,"Tjis monitor has some static around microwaves and phones, but over all the clarity is clear. BUT one night while baby and I were sleeping and when I woke up I realized the electricity had been off for who know how long and no sound came from the monitorm luckily the baby was ok.This monitor has battery but when the reciever is pluged into the outlet and the power goes off the monitor does also. You would think that the battery power would kick in but it doesn't it goes completely dead.So if you want to buy a 9volt battery every day so you doh't have to worry about the electricity failing, then this monitor is ok. However I am going to look for another monitor with back up battery power.Any suggestions????"
3,"Just OK, too much static","We registered for this monitor after reading the reviews here. I figured the people who were having problems with static maybe just got a bad monitor. We have been using ours for 9 months and have finally decided to go with another monitor. There is constant static, no matter how low you turn the volume. You might get the static to decrease in one position, but then the monitor will start to squelch for no apparent reason. I do like that it picks up all the sounds our son makes (if you can hear them over the static), something I'm finding difficult to find in the monitors we are shopping for now. Also, the receiver can run on a battery, but it runs out after just a day, so we ended up carting around the cord for that as well. This one is going to the grandparents for the few times he sleeps there and we are getting a new one."
3,Ok for what we use it for,"We got this monitor specifically for using when we visit my parents. I wouldn't want this to be my every day monitor at home but for occassional use when visiting the parents, it's fine. We have an AngelCare monitor at home but didn't want to spend another $150 for something we're only going to use a couple times a year. This is a good little basic sound only monitor."
1,Keep looking,"I got these because I have a small house and didn't intend to use them often, but I wanted something cheap for the once in a while situation. Even with limited use, I wish I had not cheaped out so much. They work fine but get feedback from just about anything, so while I can hear my baby, often the feedback is so annoying I end up turning them off. Keep shopping!"
2,Came broken,"Our monitor was broken when we got it - the baby's unit (transmitter) never lit up when you plugged it in. It seemed like a power problem. Saftey 1st was very hard to get through to on the phone. I tried off and on for a couple days before my call got answered in a reasonable amount of time. Then the return process was too long and complicated. They wanted to send me a letter to sign and return to them along with the defective monitor. Then they would send me a new one. After waiting a week before receiving the letter I changed my mind and just went out and bought a different monitor at Target. I needed a monitor and got the feeling like it was going to be another couple weeks before I'd ever get the replacement one. I like shopping on the web, but it's real frustrating when you get something that doesn't work because it's so much harder to return than if you had just bought it at the store."
5,"Works well in 2-story house, no static","This is the 3rd monitor I've purchased in the past 2 years. The first 2 were expensive because I thought I needed 900Mhz in a 2-story house. Each of those broke after a year. This time I just bought the cheapest one out there and it works just as well as the more expensive models. It is very sensitive to sound and picks up everything. We just keep it turned down low because all we really need to hear is if our daughter is crying, which we can hear at low volumes. We have a 2000 sqare foot house and the base is upstairs and the handset is downstairs with no problem. I recommend going cheap on these as they don't seem to have a long life, no matter the price."
1,Terrible at any price,"I bought this because it is dirt cheap and figured how bad could it really be? It's awful. Unless you want to listen to static all night, buy something else."
1,Not too happy,"Bought this for a baby shower gift. When opening the package I realized it has been open/ used .... The packaging was messy and taped back together by someone maybe under the age of 8. The actual product was flopping all over the place,Very disappointed. Customer"
1,Nothing but static,"Horrible monitor!!! All I could hear was static!!! I would NOT recommend this monitor to anyone. I had a Safety 1st monitor before and it was great. I don't know if they changed it within the last 2 years, but I was NOT happy with this one."
4,Great Monitor at a terrific price!,"I love this monitor more than my expensive VIDEO monitor. It has Crystal clear sound just as stated and works REALLY WELL in my 2700 sqft home. Baby can be downstairs and I'll be upstairs on the other side of the house and hear EVERYTHING that is going on in that room. One time while he was sleeping in his crib with the window shut, I could even hear the birds chirping away outside. Love this monitor and wished I had bought it sooner."
2,Not a good book,"I didn't like the book. It was VERY confusing because it was from the point of view of many different characters. I had a hard time understanding anything. I rated it two stars because it captured my interest less then 5 times and during those periods I only found interest for a minute. If you want to read a good book I recommend Harry Potter, A series of Unfortunate Events and book by Andrew Clements."
4,Witness,"When you think about the 1920's, you think of the Booming Economy , right? Then was a time for fun,right? Wrong! Not if you didn't appear '100% American'to the Ku Klux Klan.Times were bad for Leanora Sutter and Esther Hirsh, when the Klan targets them. Leanora copes, but hates the mean white kids at school. But poor Esther doesn't understand why these people hate her, why she can't stay with her friend Sara Chickering, why her mother took the heaven train. When the Klan takes action, the girls are frightened. Will they ever sleep in peace again? Will The Klan ever leave Vermont?"
3,Witness,Although sometimes weird and only a little confusing i still thought it was a good book. The word use/choice was very unique. I really liked Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse so i thought I'd give another one of her books a try. I would recommend it to people if they are looking for something different to read and also something tragic. The story is about an African American girl and a young Jewish girl living in the 1920's during the years of the Ku Klux Klan and how they are destroying the little town. It is also seen through the point of view from other towns people and what they are dealing with and what goes on in their lives.
3,Copycat!,"This book is readable and compelling in parts, but I was completely distracted by the obvious COPYING of the voice of Esther Hirsch using the writing and character of Opal Whiteley, a real life six-year-old diarist from the early 1900's in Oregon who ultimately had her diary published and became famous but is now obscure. Anyone who has read Opal Whiteley's work can see this imitation, and the unusual quality and syntax of Whiteley's diary makes it impossible for me to dismiss this as a coincidence; probably it was in Hesse's subconscious or some kind of writing workshop exercise. It is one thing to write in the style or be inspired by Opal Whiteley's amazing and original voice, but to so clearly emulate it and then not give one dollop of credit really lowers Hesse in my eyes. If I am wrong, please correct me."
2,Bitter Violence,There is too much violence in this movie and not enough entertainmen. It is the same old hunting down the bad guys by the so called good guys with a too violent beginning of the movie and in the ending. This movie is depressing from beginning to end.
4,Overrated but still good,"The Bottom Line:One False Move is by no means the movie Siskel and Ebert said it was when they crowned it the best film of the year and one of the 10 best of the nineties, but it's a solid merging of character piece and crime thriller that gets a little bit less involving when its two storylines meet but is still commendable for its character development and always watchable.3/4"
3,Works If,"If you have a big fat face this is for you my friend, I don't have that face. The three star is for my face is not big enough."
4,"Entertaining, but confusing","Connolly attempts here to write a sequel to Killing Kind, taking place scant months after the previous book. The characters are as usual with his work, compelling. Angel and Louis get more flesh on their bones this time around, with good effect. These guys really could support their own spinoff novel.Events and characters are introduced and brought forward to move the convoluted plot along, often without reference to their previous appearance. Often, I found myself returning to earlier chapters to figure it out, which I don't think you want readers to do. At story's climax, the labyrinthine events get a little muddied in your mind, which blunts the emotional impact.Still, Charlie Parker and his two ultraviolent cohorts are as engaging as ever. I liked it, but it could have been much better with a leaner plot."
5,got a lots of complements!!!,"It is very nice when serving the gravy, looks great on table with the rest of dishes, this set came out to be better than what I expected, as soon as I can I will buy a few more pieces to totally complete the set,"
5,A fabulous family saga,Loren McLeod's prose moved me deeply. This is a poignant and profound book. A must read.
5,Best. Christmas DVD. Ever,"Recently, I got this DVD for my birthday. Already, I have fallen in love with it. I would have to say Mr. Plow or grift of the Magi are the best. WARNING: may cause severe laugh atacks!!"
4,Good Book,"If you like reading about grown men act like a bunch of whiney women this is your book.This book should be call ""Phil Jackson my last year of babysitting"""
1,disapointing lack of depth,"As a casual NBA fan and admirer of all Phil Jackson has done, I bought this book hoping to find something which would provide insight into the happenings behind the scenes, how Jackson handled all the chaos, and insight into an interesting season. Unfortunately Jackson's book does not weave a single cohesive theme. It is presented as a series of disjointed diary entries which spend far too much time focusing on recapping the most recent basketball game. Although there are some interesting noted in the book, some of which are highlighted in other reviews (and some of which made the news), they are few and far between, and usually buried in piles of game analysis and box score review. I hope Phil Jackson keeps his day job."
3,"Zen, Ego, Fame","Good book. Subject matter is interesting. Coach Jackson is likeable but his writing is lacking. This was the author's inward look at a season filled with surprises, peaks, and valleys. The irony is that he is returning to coach the Lakers next season and this book will act as the giant elephant in the room that nobody will want to talk about.Outside of the obvious issues: Kobe's ego, lockerroom dissension, etc... This is your typical ""a season in"" diary of a sports team, with all the ebbs and flows that playing in the NBA provides. Jackson offers few poignant observations about the league that a serious fan doesn't already know or suspect. Still valuable as a worthy document of a popular and polarizing sports franchise."
3,Good Bye Phil,"Being a lifelong Laker fan, I for one is glad Phil and Shaq are gone, good riddance! This book is filled with gossipy stuff it makes me want to vomit. Phil, you'll never break Red Auerbach record for most titles. Don't buy this book, it's a wasteof money, buy Charles Barley's book instead."
3,Rate it:Three Margaritas,"It's amazing what they'll print up and bind into a book. This one could have been a substantial installment in the L.A. Times Sunday magazine, but a book?No more insight than you would get reading a Sports Illustrated article, but perhaps easier to carry around than a stack of magazines.Make no mistake, it's very readable.""Then Kobe said. . . """"Then Shaq said. . . """"Then Kobe said. . .""We love the trash! But it just doesn't carry the weight of a book. I rate it Three Margaritas because you could take it to the beach, drink the three Margies and not miss much as you read it. Rather than buy it, check it out of the library. I am not a fast reader but this one won't take you long to finish.If you want to buy a Phil Jackson book, buy Sacred Hoops. At least that pushes the envelope a wee bit, perhaps makes you think, and doesn't leave you feeling so trashy when it's over."
5,Rock in Espa√±ol,"Written in Spanish for the beginner to intermediate guitar player who wants to explore the techniques necessary for playing rock. All of the examples are based on popular styles/artists such as: Guns 'n' Roses, Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots, ACDC, Man√°, Carlos Vives, Shakira, and many others. 20 music examples are broken down into rhythm and lead guitar parts and each guitar part is broken down even further into 3 different versions from basics to variations. Every technique is written in standard notation and tablature and clearly demonstrated on the accompanying CD.This is a must for all Spanish language guitarists."
5,"With few exceptions, Jesuits aren't Catholic.","This book is a sad, but true, commentary on the total decay of a once-great Order."
4,well satisfied,"Good value for the money. I was having hip pain due to a 3/8"" difference in leg length. The heel lift has reduced the pain, and with time should improve 100%"
3,heel lift (singular) - NOT a pair!,"call me a silly girl. i thought this was for short vain men with bad taste who also wore toupees & the like. i therefore assumed it would be a PAIR of lifts. apparently, it is intended for the very pragmatic purpose of evening out uneven leg lengths. my intended use was to lift both feet within my shoes to a height that put my ankle knobs above the fray, since the normal inserts are not doing the job. so many shoes dig into my ankle knobs that i am beginning to think that i have abnormally low ones - should i be embarassed? anyway, to purchase another one, i would have to pay S&H ($4.95) all over again; to return this one, would cost me the postage without getting back the original S&H. i am stuck with a product i cannot use, due to not knowing the purpose of this product intuitively & not bothering to fully absorb the meaning of the product listing. i hope i spare future potential purchasers my inconvenient situation with this review."
2,Don't Bother,"35 Bucks for this? Don't bother; immediately upgrade to 512 MB or 1 GB, which are ideal for video, image, and music storage on the PSP."
4,not idle,"This represents the classic Loeb style. Those like me whose Doric is quite rusty will have to struggle from time to time, but the challenges of Doric cannot compete with those of the English translation, a tour de force in northern (Scots) dialect. This proper Loeb makes one consult the Greek dictionary, etc.Edmunds was a good text critic and produced a valuable edition. On such matters as human sexuality the introductions and renditions are hopelessly Victorian. One is not reading extravagant descriptions of friendship, but of love between men."
1,Act Of Congress,"Resolved: That any person who by writings or utterance disagree in whole or in part with the conclusions expressed herein shall be fined a sum not to exceed $100,000 and be incarcerated in a Federal correctional facility for a period not to exceed 30 years."
3,E. Howard Hunt admits involvement in plot to kill Kennedy,"Just in case nobody has heard lately (including Mr. Bugliosi), but E. Howard Hunt has admitted in a deathbed confession that Johnson and the CIA did, in fact, take Kennedy out! For those who don't remember E. Howard Hunt, he was a career CIA agaent, involved in the ""Bay of Pigs"", and the list goes on..., but he will be most remembered for spending 3 years in prison over his involvement in the Watergate scandal. The confession, which was recorded, has been released to the media, but has received only minor press coverage (that doesn't suprise me in the least).Remember that Bugliosi a very talented lawyer. He does bring his facts together, but let's not forget that his talent is to use those facts to convince people to come to a predetermined conclusion!Good book, but I liked ""Helter Skelter"" a lot more!"
1,A patsy is an innocent fall guy,"""Reclaiming History?"" Vince needs to reclaim his brain. What happened to his excellent work searching for the co-conspirators in Bobby Kennedy's murder? Students of the JFK case will know, this time Vince is getting his facts from some very unreliable sources. It's a shame."
5,Best Book Ever On The Assassination,"A number of years ago I read many books about the assassination. I never felt I had the true story. Too much speculation. After reading this book, you would have to be a person that denies gravity to believe in a conspiracy. It is a relief to have this tome. It is not impressive; it is staggeringly impressive. It is the definitive work on the assassination. If you want to come as close as possible to what happened to JFK read this book. Mr. Bugliosi is a master communicator. You won't find a more exciting read. The best book probably ever on the Kennedy assassination."
4,Unbelievably believable.,"It's interesting to see the conspiracy folks sweat this one out. They have too much time and reputation invested to be proven wrong. Above all, this book just may cut into the profits they make from peddling their lies. Most of them probably knew they themselves were wrong from the beginning, but they never thought there was any way they could be exposed for the fools they are. Every negative review here confirms this in my opinion. Great job, Bugliosi."
2,Too much junk,"The Kennedy assassination is and will probably always be a debated topic. This book claims to be the ""final word"" on the matter. However, by that, I think the author means that after drudging through this overly descriptive and frequently irrelevant text, you will be too tired [or bored] to argue. While Bugliosi poses some fair defenses for the Warren ruling, he also dismisses important points that contradict his arguments as the rantings and ravings of mad conspiracy theorists. Demonstrating a clear bias of opinion and spending too much time talking about things that don't matter, the author doesn't present a balanced argument. And if that's what you're looking for, I don't recommend this book."
1,Mish Mash Again,When is someone going to do real research on the crime of the 20th Century. No one has ever looked at all the evidence and taken each item individually and examined it. Posner was wrong 10 years ago and Buliosi is lacking in his study now. All evidence points to something completely different than one man with rifle. But of course no one wants to really touch this subject objectively. One one side you have the lone-nut theorists and other side has the conspiracy theorists that have everyone and their brother involved. If one looks at the evidence one sees a conspiracy but nothing as large as everyone portrays.
1,No bargain,"This is the worst experience I've had with a purchase on-line. The ring didn't fit, I measured it before I bought with the ring I've been wearing for years, however, because of the comfort fit feature it was too small. I contacted the company and they said to send it back and just pay shipping and they would send me another size, UPS called to tell me I had to pay a 48.00 tax fee on it because it was Canada, so I had to pay 12.00 just to get it sent back to me. After paying everything I've put 211.00 in a ring that is worthless to me, because it doesn't fit."
3,Interesting book.,"Very interesting book. Helps get some insight into the mind of Norman W. Walker. Not much in book was relevant to our lifestyles today & though you can see why he is into juicing, he doesn't really go into it in this book. I found colon health information fascinating!"
2,disappointing,"I think I had a false expectation. I expected something 'more' - images similar to the Bacon images in 'Van Gogh and Expressionism' which are stunning and vibrantly colorful. The images in this book fell short of that. Had I looked through this book in a bookstore, I would not have purchased. I should have done more research on Bacon before purchasing this and the Bacon portraits book which also was a disappointment but better than this one."
5,This really is a great album.,"I have always loved Blues Traveler but I was skeptical to hear DJ Logic on turntables. What a pleasant surprise. It doesn't sound like anything else. I mean, music wise- it's Blues Traveler but it's got a nice twist on it. I can't say that every song is perfect but if you are into experimental music instead of mainstream, then check this out. I amso glad that i did and would love a second album!Chad Koenig"
1,Life Application Bible from Amazon,The print on this bible is so light you can hardly read it. Even the giant print one is so light and the pages are so thin on both that you can see words coming thru on the other pages. The publisher needs to make bolder print and thicker paper. Did receive in good condition and was speedy delivery thru Amazon
4,large print,"I really have trouble reading the FINE PRINT. I just received this Bible as a gift for my birthday from my nephew in California. It was such a lovely gift,but, I'm not sure how I can tell him I am unable to read the small print.I don't know if this comes in large print or not, but if it does, is there any way that I can exchange it? It's the leather bound with gold leafed pages. Thank you, lc moyer-warboys"
5,This bible is so easy to understand. I really enjoy reading it!,"I have ordered 3 of these bibles recently. My 24 yr old son and 23 yr old daughter love reading it,and the additional study notes are fantastic."
2,A Bit Disappointed,"This book sits unused on my bookshelf. Why? There wasnt much in it I would want to make and some of the patterns I could get for free online. I might try the sock pattern sometime, but thats about it. I liked the fact that its a small size book and easy to take along but I dont take it anywyhere."
4,Solid Warm Weather Bad,Good solid warm weather/indoor sleeping bag. Could do into the 40s or 50s but we used in 60 degree weather and were fine. Nothing fancy but good enough for biscuits.
1,A RIP-OFF!,THOUGH THE ARTISTS WERE FAMILIAR THE SONGS WEREN'T. MOST OF THEM SOUNDED LIKE THE OTHER SIDE OF THEIR HIT RECORDINGS. WHO KNOWS???
3,For the Ill Informed...,"Yes, Total Chaos actually did have recordings as far back as 1989. I still have their first self-titled album to prove it--purchased directly from the band out of the back of a Maximum Rock 'N' Roll magazine almost 15 years ago. Still, TC can't be defined as ""old school"" as their sound, even on later releases, is quite unoriginal. (These recordings are similar to late-70's/early 80's British hardcore like Chaos UK, Discharge, Conflict.)""Early Years"" is their self-titled first album re-released, plus a few extras. Though I don't have a turntable to play the old LP for comparison purposes, I'm sure that this has been remastered. The first album suffered from poor production; most of the songs were tightened-up and re-recorded for their 1994 Epitaph debut, ""Pledge of Defiance."" If you don't own Pledge yet, don't waste your money on this one."
1,Not What You Think...,"Well,let me me start off by informing the ill-informed;Total Chaos didn't have any recordings out in '89 or '90,Secondly;niether the lyrics or the music is intelligent,inciteful or have much knowledge behind it.While it is true that this album does contain the music as it was in their earlier(sheesh!)years,there is much to tell behind the release of these songs and what the band did to come up.I was a personal friend of the founding members of this band,and their ""number one worthless roadie""(see their web page,if they still have one).What the band became(greedy for fame & money)wasn't at all what they were when they started(note the brand spankin' new ""punk rock"" clothing on the cover of ""Anthems from the Alleyways"").If you like your English-influenced,Bristle & Spiky punk rock-Buy this album,but think of it as a cartoon,and not a true Punk Rock recording.Good Luck in the 21st century,all you crazy Punk Rock kids-It's only gonna get harder. BONES"
1,Still Not Here,"The title says it all. I'm still waiting... I need this for a class of mine, and ordered it weeks ago. If something's out of stock, that's fine, but when it says it isn't, there shouldn't be this long of a wait."
1,Disappointed,"I received a CD that was a copy of a CD (not original) and this CD did not play on any of my CD players. I have nice stereos and a couple cheap ones and nothing! I am very disappointed and do not recommend you buy anything used, unless you want to be ripped off. I only recommend new."
2,not as good as in the picture,I was disappointed by the quality of the set: the touch and the pattern is no better than the walmart quality. But I do like to size of the plates--I have been looking for this size for quite sometime. The picture on amazon looks a lot better. I returned it because one piece was broken during delivery. Won't buy it again from the same brand.
4,quality and well thought throughout,I feel that this series is most worthwhile for any student on his own or one being guided by a teacher. I jumped right into the first of the series and am enjoying the method and the results. The Intermediate book and CD appears to simply enhance the Beginning Jazz Guitar book and move on to greater depth. My only small criticism of the series(4 in all) is that they should include a DVD to further augment their instruction in all 4 of the books and not just with the Beginning Jazz text. Nice series overall. Ps. A good selection of practice pieces as well.
2,Blah-blah-blah,"I guess this album has kind of a feel-good vibe to it, but that's really the best there is to say.First of all... Blake Knight is a terrible emcee, and Play-dough is only average. Second they have max three topics on this entire album, which are ""we rock the mic (8-9 songs)"", ""girls (2 songs)"" and some shallow spiritual topics. Third, the beats have NO progression whatsoever, ALL the beats have boring guitar-samples going thru the entire song, and they all sound the same. Sorry, this is not good enough."
4,"At $10, a great deal!","Sleepy Hollow on bluray isn't anything special in the picture quality department, but Sweeney Todd looks and sounds great! It's also the better of the two Burton films, IMHO."
1,Doesn't Work!,"This is the correct product but for some reason, it won't program to my car. I have the exact same one (but older) and it will unprogram and reprogram, but this remote won't work at all. Caution!"
4,Beautiful Bargain,"These discs are well recorded. And the music, itself, is stunning in its variety and complexity, all the while retaining a poetic wonderfulness. It engages the listener, but isn't so overpowering that it can't serve as good background music for dinner or studying."
4,Fine Western,"This western remake of the war move Sahara is very good. Broderick Crawford heads the cast which includes Barbara Hale and Lloyd Bridges, who was also in Sahara. It's a good remake with suspense and well-staged action scenes. It's very good entertainment."
4,Last Of The Comanches.,"Pretty good remake of Sahara(1943,turned into a Western with Broderick Crawford in the Humphrey Bogart part.Broderick Crawford as Great as ever.Maybe its not as good as Sahara,but its not bad either.Good cast,Barbra Hale,Llyod Bridges(also in Sahara)Martin Milner,Steve Forrest,etc"
5,Can't go wrong with Corelle,"Corelle knows what they are doing. They know how to make high quality dishware. All my dishes and mugs are by Corelle and I really love their stuff. It's not too expensive, but it's very good quality. I'm very happy with how these simple white salt and pepper shakers match the rest of my dishware. What's nice about them being plain, is that I can change up the style of my dishware at any time and they will still go with it. Also, they are very easy to fill and the stopper on the bottom work great."
2,Baking soda,Sodium hydrogen carbonate is the chemical name for common baking soda. So save some money and buy it at your local grocery store or buy in bulk at Costco or Sam's Club. All of the SPA UP and/or pH Up products are baking soda.
3,Good product - package is a little large.,Package size is much bigger than it needs to be. Wish this product had been included in the starter kit.
5,Price is great,Price is super compared to what I would pay locally at the spa store. Wish I could get the chlorine shipped also as it would be a great savings.
4,respectable for what you pay,"for a portable radio cassette, it passes muster. had it about a month. gets decent reception of those harder to get stations, say npr from over the hill for example. craftsmanship is what you'd expect from a player of this cost. my last portable radio cassette lasted 10 years for half the price, a ""york"" product. this works if you don't want to shell out hundreds for a portable fm mp3."
3,good,This item is good value. I needed a cassette player and only cps now. So this was a good alternative
1,Disappointed,"I purchased four of these tape players for use in a classroom. Two of them worked for only a few days, and the other two only work if you wiggle the batteries until they are in just the right position. I am a few days past the return date, so I am stuck with one of them. Tape players should last longer than that. But, I guess you get what you pay for."
1,why.,"i bought this cassette player because it was the second cheapest i could find. i figured it wouldnt be so bad, but now i see that was a bad idea. it makes all my cassettes sound like theyre melting. it actually worked maybe three times though, so it wasnt all bad i suppose"
5,Listen to my old cassettes,Sounds great for my old CD It is hard to find something to listen to these on but this sounds great
1,Did not work properly!,This radio right out of the box did not work properly. The volume was barely audible. Defective! Do not buy this radio!!! As they say you get what you pay for!
1,Coby CX49 Rip-Off. Do not purchase.,"I purchased two so that I would have a spare. This unit plays cassette tapes and has a 3VDC plug-in to use in my automobile. Both units have so much static that it is impossible to listen to tapes or radio. I tried my OPTIMUS SCP-105 to verify that the tapes are OK and that the radio spectrum is not noisy. But the problem is inherent in the Coby unit. This Coby CX49 was a bad choice for me. Unfortunately, there is no documentation covering any warrantees so I am out of luck. I never thought AMAZON.COM would have DUDS listed on their product listing."
1,Missing features,"Poor sound quality , There is no rewind button which should have been listed in advertisement. Would not recommend to anyone."
4,This is Good,"Hey if you like Lets Active you will like this interpretation Great band that will never get the attention they deserved... Saw them many times in the 80's and man Mitch Easter knows how to deliver a pop song ... and do a good cover of the Rover by Led Zepp.. At William and Mary Hall in Williamsburg, VA opening for REM"
1,Contains bitterant,"Leaving a 1 star review for those who are looking for a quick answer.Yes, this product contains a bitterant."
4,GREAT! except,This tote for lunch is WONDERFUL! The only thing they should have done is have 2 small plastic caps for the salt & pepper shakers. Such an EZ solution to spilled salt & pepper in the front compartment. Still I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this item!
1,Terrible customer service,"I ordered this item 5 days ago with 2 day shipping. Apparently, it has not even been shipped yet?????? I use Amazon because this sort of thing NEVER happens. But never say never.This was for a gift that had to be delivered today. Now, it looks as though I can't even cancel it...."
4,A book on how to position yourself in sales and life!,"This book is dated and the focus is on Ringers expierence in real estate BUT when I got about half way into the book I realized why it got great reviews: The first half of the book relives the pain and rejection all starting people in sales expierence. Then in the second half we learn how the author positioned himself to stand apart from the crowd.Position, position, position is in sales what location is to Real estate. This book details how he finds prospects (he cold calls) but then turns the table so he is not just another sales person.Stick with this book until the end - read it twice if you need to - but read it, think about it, and learn from the authors pain to avoid your own!"
5,Stop Sucking Up and Start Selling,"Ringers book is poorly named but well-written. It is focused on real-estate but its principles hold true for all sales and business. Provide the most value, service, expertise, and you desrve to get PAID. Sucking up to get customers does not work, people buy from people they like and RESPECT. Intimidation is not about being mean, its about providing value."
4,Funny and light; Easy Read,"I enjoyed ths book very much. I found it easy to read and follow. I enjoyed the descriptions which were pleasing without excessive detail. The characters are interesting and believable; moreso than the crimes which are there but beside the point. A little too much politics woven into the story, but all in all a very good read. Well worth the money."
5,Awesome book!,"I bought this book for my husband who is active duty Army and an avid Boy Scout....he says about the book, ""I haven't had time to read it all...but what I have read is insightful and interesting. I look forward to being able to sit down and read it all."""
4,the two lives of a hero,"Robert S. S. Baden-Powell was a great man ""out in the field"". He was amilitary genius of the British army in his time, and he brought hisingenuity and experiences together at home for the boys of Englandand founded the Boy Scouts. He is respectively referred to today asthe ""Chief Scout of the World"". This book tells you everything youneed to know about this particular ""Hero""! Philip Loving"
3,"Army ""brats"" beware!","I found this to be the usual frothy summer reading with the usual implausible plot: entertaining enough to while away a sunny afternoon without requiring too much thought.One warning, however, and this really started to bug me about 75 pages in: the author's generalizations about growing up civilian vs. growing up on an army base were both totally inaccurate and a little offensive. If Ms. Krum bothered to get to know any real army ""brats"" (I hate that term), she'd see that we don't view civilian life with disgust (maybe a little envy for a lifestyle that allows you to know the same people all your life), and we don't snort ""civilians!"" whenever something happens that we don't understand.Jane Spring's problems aren't from growing up army, but from having been raised by a B-movie caricature of a windbag general. Considering that Ms. Krum is Australian, I wouldn't be surprised if her only experience of American military life actually came from B-movies."
3,Hoo Hum,Pretty run of the mill Egyptian whodonnit. None of these compare to Paul's Alexander the Great books.
4,Meditation,"This is a great basic meditation book with applicable ideas to relieve stress in your life, especially for someone who does not have much time."
5,Great introduction to meditation,"I have been meditating for many years and my friends were asking for a good ""starter"" book. I read the book, followed the process, and can definitely recommend this book. I have purchased several copies as gifts for friends."
3,How do you milk a frog?,"I caught sight of this book while out with my toddler and instantly thought: ""what a great idea!"" The eyes on the front of the book look up at you as a different character on every page and roll around in comical fashion when you shake the book.Sadly though, I don't think it really reaches its potential. The art style is over-the-top wacky but quite in suiting with the googly eyes. However, every page basically repeats the same chant: Never put a frog in the kitchen sink/father's shoes/brothers pants etc. over and over for page after page. This really undoes any novelty value the eyes give the book. After a couple of reads I didn't want to open it again.Admittedly, my child is still below the recommended age limit for this book. But if I don't want to read it to him when he's four, it doesn't have nearly so much value to us. I would not have bought this book if I'd read it through first.Still, the eyes are great!"
5,Got it for $24.99,"The price is fantastic for 8oz. Any size equivalent in the stores, from current cologne companies, would run you around $120. Not sure you could even find this scent in the stores, as it was popular many years back.The packaging and smell all seem to be as they were back when it was popular."
1,poor quality,"The pincers quickly become inoperable. I have to open it by hand and reset it so it can grab something else. It's mechanism broke by the 1st week I had it, with only a few uses."
1,You get what you pay for... and this is cheap.,"As a new fish keeper, I needed something to help me place plants in my aquarium. So I purchased this item. About the third time I used it, It broke... The mechanics behind the design are so simple, it negatively affects the product. Thus resulting in a weak clamp and short lifetime."
2,"Just not very good indie pop, but one great song!","Sprites is led by the former frontman of the beloved indie electronic group Barcelona. I'll just say that I have a soft spot for Barcelona (yeah, I'm a fanboy), but even I can admit that this album is pretty bad. Most of the songs are ok, some are terrible, but the first one is actually really really good (and that moved it from a 1 to a 2). Even if you're a fan of Barcelona, don't buy this album. ""Do It Yourself"" is a great tune, but you can download it for free from their site (as well as ""I Go Crazy"" which isn't on the album - that's another pretty good tune). Not recommended - for $16.00 (plus shipping) you could buy WAY better albums.Highlights include:""Do It Yourself""""Following Her Around"" (it's not bad)""Keep It Together"" (the drumming is kind of cool)"
3,not fluid enough,"it was a nice ring, and i was psyched on the idea of a steel ring, but i feel like the undersides of the bands should have been smoothed out more and maybe it would have rolled a little easier on my finger. but the color was unexpected and nice."
4,A Powerful Testament,"This book is a wrenching must read for all pro-choice people. It tells in detail what we suspected was really going on all over the country, and in that sense is a very very political and action oriented book. But like the women's movement itself, the personal is political, and I was moved more than once to tears reading about the personal stories of families' and individuals' stories of courage and pain and perserverance in the face of sometimes constant harrassment and threats and more out there working for our health and lives and basic human rights as women. Amazing. I never read a book that put it all together quite as well as this one."
2,The relativity of choice,"Mrs. Windle's book was very entertaining although not very original. Mostly it consists of a laundry list of the alleged activities by the 'anti's' whom she blames for all her troubles, although others may say that her career 'choice' was the cause of her grief. She specifically blames Operation Rescue's IMPACT school graduates for her decline in health and finances, but brushes aside the stigma of an ""image of providers as less than noble"" (her own words) and the visual carnage that must be the daily reproductive health scene as contributing factors. Although the subtitle of this book is 'Antiabortion Terrorism' she details many antiabortion activites which are harmless and legal. Could these actions have significantly lowered the daily ""take"" and thus be the real reason why Mrs. Windle cried Uncle?"
5,A.J. won't let you down.,"A genre-jumping, satisfy-all-ages, better-every time-you-listen-to-it CD that you'll have trouble removing from the player. A.J. lifts your spirit,folks...check him out."
5,A BOOK TO REMEMBER,SARAH HAS DONE IT AGAIN. HER WRITING KEEPS YOU INTERSTED ANDMAKES YOU WANT TO READ ON AND NOT LAY IT DOWN .
2,"If you love good writing and well-developed mysteries, don't bother","I'm always looking for new mysteries. I couldn't even finish this one. (others of hers may be better) Characters are shallow, plot is plodding and bland. Cute title."
3,Not what I expected...,"Great yoga mat if you're traveling across town, not if you're traveling across the country. I was looking for a portable mat to pack in a carry-on suitcase/backpack to use while traveling, but this mat ended up taking up about the same space as a rolled mat. I should have paid closer attention to the details on size and weight - don't make the same mistake I did!"
3,travel yoga mat,rarely use this mat as it is not practical for plane travel or moving around alot. It takes up too much weight. Otherwise is fine. Provides lots of cushioning and has a convenient travel case.
1,All the 1 star reviews are ... correct.,"This was an experiment in human nature. I wanted to transfer my old LPs so badly that I thought this might be worth a chance. Well it turned out to be so bad on so many levels that now I'm embarrassed. Mainly the sound quality is, maybe, 8-bit resolution - if that. It did, however, monitor ambient sounds like - aircraft flying over - while I tried to transcribe a test transfer to a file. At least the file creation did occur. If you want to take it off my hands, and pay my costs (54.99USD + shipping costs to you) - make a comment on this review. I have to admit, Woot did warn me."
2,produces poor fidelity,"Ordered this unit to convert vinyl to CDs. That it does, but at noticeable loss of fidelity. Bass is nearly non-existent in the resulting digitized music. I turn bass all the way up in my equalizer and the treble down low, and still get tinny, hollow sound with no bass."
4,ok but,"I enjoy this product, however I am a bit PO'ed about the reliance on ITUNES for the storing of a mp3's generated from this device.would have preferred a simple mp3 recorder."
1,useless piece of junk,"useless.................nothing worked as advertised...........hate having to use iTunes in the first place. Just using it as a standalone player doesn't work, with the volume up 100% you can barely hear it from the speaker ..............."
4,Great Tool,"This is a great tool for those of us in the repair, manufacturing, and cleaning of weapons. A MUST HAVE!!!"
5,Encyclopedic,"A vast array of information not easily available. Reliable reviews of the wines of virtually every known winery, and reliable comments about the future development and direction of wineries."
2,overpriced and overrated,"For fifty dollars, you'd expected a product more stout and substantial. Six thin, small diameter poles approximately 1/2 inch in diameter, which replaced much heavier 3/4 inch poles I had acquired years ago for less than one half the price. True, these appear to be galvanized and should resist rust, but time will tell.These poles are a deal at $20 bucks; highway robbery at $50....john"
3,A must-have album,"As you get to know this artist, you'll begin to feel like him, and you'll be able to experience those feelings completely by having and enjoying this great album. This is a great incursion in spanish music. In fact, A MUST-HAVE!"
4,Works but a few problems,"It works just as advertised. The only thing I dislike is how the shrimp swim out. My fish constantly wait at the fish guard gobbling them up. I wish they would have a more constant escape, but it's like in bursts. It should feed them several times a day like it says, but I wish they came out constantly in like a streamline of small quantities instead of just a few large bursts. Also, a lot of dead shells end up in the collection chamber. You also have to leave the air on at all times because if you don't, the shrimp won't get put into the right area to get out, they will try to swim up at the top near the light where they can't get out. So overall, it works as advertised, just with a few little problems. If I had to do it over though, I would just get a cup and do it that way. But it does come with a dropper which is nice."
4,Decent schrader valve but not as pictured,"This is a nice schrader valve and bigger as reported by previous reviews. The larger base was perfect for my situation and I tapped a larger hole which I used a 1/8"" -27 thread tap and about .45"" inch wide. From the top of cap to base is 1 INCH long and total length is longer than 1.5"" inches. Unlike the previous review I didn't get the valve core remover which I wanted. I got the item from Deerso which also sells the cheaper brass ""air intake valve"" and decide to skimp on my valve core cap and gave me the standard green one. I could've used the valve core remover to depressurize my tank"
5,"Great for a ""Fresh & Clean"" smelling dog","I purchased this creme rinse after a coworker was talking about how great it was. I have to agree it leaves my dog smelling fresh & clean for 2 weeks and I have a big dog that spends most of the time outside. I dilute it 7:1 with water for use as a leave in conditioner. It makes my dog's hair as soft and fluffy, at least as much as a wire-haired dog can be. I gave a pre-diluted bottle to my neighbor so he can use it on his dog that spends a lot of time at my house. I use J&J Lavender baby shampoo first and then follow with this creme rinse without rinsing."
5,Great deal,Again farberware is a brand you can not go wrong with. The price is excellent and the quality is awesome. Highly recommend especially if you want years of use from a good set of pans
4,Nice for the money,"I purchased these at the store. These are the nicest cooking pans I have owned The largest skillet is a little shallow but the width helps make up for it unless you are trying to cook a really big batch, but good for frying eggs or chicken, etc.. the silicone handles are a major plus for comfort do a nice job shielding from the heat. I certainly reccomend this to others. These pans are awesome. I like to see throught the lid, I now know what's going on in there. Cooks very well, does not burn food or stick, nonstick without a dought."
1,Misleading and Sophamoric--NO STARS,"Mostly for college kids...Yes, it is. Should work well for inspiring new bumpersticker designs and t-shirt slogans.The Distributor is worth noting."
5,Some Pretty Darn Good Earbuds,"The Sony MDR-E828LP Fontopia Earbuds are arguably the best buy for under $20. This is my fifth pair, and I'm very pleased. I use my more expensive headphones when I'm at home, but these are perfect for a trip to the gym or walking to lecture. If you'll notice, the frequency response is 12-22000Hz. This means that these babies can produce really nice highs and lows. Again these are highly recommended!"
4,Sturdy Headphones,"I've had two of these the first one lasted me 2 years or so and I was surprised that it survived some accidental strong pulls, so these are pretty sturdy headphones.But my second pair I got was defective upon buying; only that I didn't notice it right away and then I didn't have the receipt anymore so I kept them.Sometimes the connection to the right earbud seems to be loose and then there is a rustling sound."
5,Great Price for this product,This is an excellent product for the price. The sound is great plus it comes with a great storage case. I would highly recommend this.
4,great sound but kinda uncomfortable,"I've owned these for around a year and I gotta say these earbuds are awesome in terms of sound quality. But these are my first ones and I have nothing to compare it. Still, these are great entry level ones and I dont regret the 10 bucks purchase. Bass is okay but not great, and the performance seem ""lifelike"", not like echoing ones like most stock ones.They are a tadpit uncomfortable to wear however. I removed the cushion because it kept on getting stuck in my ear, and ever since then it has been a little uncomfortable. When I'm wearing it upright its fine and dandy, and doesnt fall out. But when I lay down to enjoy some music it falls out or is uncomfortable pressed. Maybe its my big ears but I think the silicone ones may have a better feel."
3,"Okay Headphones, Great Case","Well the headphones are not quality, but you get what you pay for. The caae is great and they cannot get in a tangled mess but it takes a few minutes to wind them or un-wind them. The headphones them selves allow you to hear lots of ambient sound and are kind of large for earbuds, like the I-Pod ones. Definatly better qualitiy then I-Pod though."
5,"My Ears Like 'Em, yours will too!","As an audio professional I trust what my ears tell me and they say that these are a REALLY nice pair of ear buds. Now don't get me wrong, no pair of ear buds could ever be an adequate replacement for a good set of headphones, but these are among the best I've heard and get the job done in fine fashion.Very good sounding throghout the audio spectrum but have they also have an especially nice bass response. I also like the fact that they are open air and do not shut you off from your surroundings. This is an especially nice feature if you live in an urban area, IMHO. These ear buds are also very comfortable and the wind up case is a BIG plus (why couldn't Apple include something like this with theirs?) If you're buying an iPod consider buying these as an upgrade to the famous white buds that they all come with, the Sonys sound 10 time better.Get 'em while they're hot, your ears will thank you."
3,"good, but don't have much to compare to...","I think the headphones work fine, expecially for the price. However, I haven't used a whole lot of other earbud sets. I do think the foam cover comes off easily as I've already lost one and once they are gone, the earbud refuses to stay in your ear. If you press them in really tight, the bass works best. I would recommend based on price and quality."
3,good sound/cheap,"These headphones, like most headphones, sound great compared to speakers at a similar price.However, for something this cheap I've always liked Sony ear-buds because of the case -- most headphones are awkward and delicate for traveling. This winding case was great until mine stopped winding after four months."
4,You can't beat these for the price,"What's not to like? The price is fantastic and the sound is great. I wore out one pair, and then bought two more (one set for work, one for my gym bag). I've used various types of Sony earbuds and headphones, and these have always been my favorites--not only for the sound, but for their fit and, of course, for the extremely handy wind-up case. I also like that the cable is longer than competitors'. My only gripe is that my toddler son likes to chew the foam off, and replacement foam is ridiculously expensive.If you just need an inexpensive pair of ""kick-around"" earbuds, you really can't go wrong with these."
4,Great Deal! Not the most comfortable...,"These earbuds sound just as good as the $50 Sony's my husband purchased for his iPod. The only drawback is his buds came with different adaptors to adjust the fit. These are a one-size fits all deal and are very large. So if you have small ears, like me, they aren't the most comfortable. They did come with padding, so they feel better than the iPod buds for certain. However if you're looking for real comfort you'll need to shell out the cash.I'm pleased with these. They're a bargain!"
3,Great but not awesome.,"i love these headphones... while they stay alive.the winding case is extremely fun to use and i would find myself winding and unwinding the headphones for no apparent reason.the headphones are great. they sound great, and for $10 you will not find anything better.there is one major downside though: for some reason one of the earbuds will die out over time. this has happened with every sony headphone i have had (not just these), and for some reason it is always the left earbud, but i always deem buying another pair worth it (they are only $10 at walgreens).sony need to fix the earbud problems with their headphones (these arent the only headphones with this problem), and if they did i would be willing to pay more money for these headphones."
2,Cord's too short. Earbuds too big in diameter.,"Cord is only 3.5 feet long, which turns out to be about 3 inches too short for my needs. It doesn't quite reach from my iPod in the pocket of my gym-shorts to my ears. I'm tall (6'5"") but this could still be a problem for anyone over 6 feet.Also, the buds are wider around than iPod earbuds, and they don't quite stay put in my ears like iPod ones do."
3,Winding case,"I bought these because I thought the cords were retractable. Turns out the ""winding case"" does not wind the cords; you have to do that yourself. As for the quality of sound, it's decent. It doesn't have the musicality and bass clarity of my considerably more expensive earbuds, but it's fine if you just want to listen to tunes while concentrating on something else."
5,The BEST headphones period.,"I got these headphones about a decade ago, and these had amazing bass. Not too much bass, not too little bass. Just the perfect amount of bass and crispness where I can close my eyes and immerse myself in the music with. Since then, I have spent roughly $400 and have gone through 8 additional headphones that have not even come close to these (5 of them from Sony, some of professional grade). These being the cheapest ones for about $10! I'm never going to try to find something better. As perfection was always $10 away, and paying more always seemed like you got a lot less.I lost these 8 years ago, but I just picked up new ones yesterday, and I can say that I can come to loving music at a much higher level once again. If you have these headphones, you'd know exactly what I mean by that. There definitely is magic in their Twin Turbo technology."
4,Sony earbuds,The ear buds arrived on time as stated.Delivery was prompt and am satisfied with the service.This was a great deal.
2,Between Good and Worse,"The winding case is completely useless....It looks fancy, but after the first few times, winding becomes irritating. The sponge caps keep coming out. They do not fit the ear phones properly. And I already loast mine, just after owning it for 5 weeks.The same thing happened with my two other friends who bought the same earphones. Now I am using them without sponge caps....irritating!!"
5,High Quality with discount pricing,"On time shipping with good packing didn't delay my moving schedule! With very good quality ""thick"" and ""stick"" protects the boxes well. The price with this quality is reasonable! Recommend this for moving and packing."
5,A Must Read!,"Amazing. This book absorbede!The knowledge(?) provided through this book is of great potential importantce to everyone - worldwide.The style is easy and engrossing, and the author's take on a multi-angled view in their research. Looking at the science, archeology, and mythological evidence (as well as the many eye witnesses to the skulls mysterious powers) the book points towards invaluable insights, from the origins and forgotten histories of humankind, to the possiblilies and purposes of our future destiny.After reading this book, my whole perception of the world shifted sideways - twenty foot that way! (he says pointing in both directions).A real must read for anyone interested in the ancient mysterious, ancient wisdom and/or spiritual knowledge.Take a look and decide for yourself.NB. If you like/liked this book, take a look at 'The Scole Experiment' - I think you'll like that too."
1,Where's the Beef?,"In the 70's there was American British and Canadian rock. Its a shame that most living outside of Canada didn't get an opportunity to hear a lot more of the Canadian product. My biggest beef with all of the April Wine ""greatest hits"" compilations was the fact that most of the rocking early years has been largely ignored. Who put these compilations together? Where was lead singer/songwriter/guitarist Myles Goodwyn during all of this? Where is ""Fast Train, Bad Side of the Moon, Drop Your Guns, Electric Jewels, Weeping Widow, Just Like That, You Could Have Been a Lady, Anything You Want, Victim for Your Love, Forever for Now, Cat's Claw, Come on Along, The Band Has Just Begun"" etc etc etc? The albums ""Electric Jewels, On Record and Stand Back"" as well as ""Live at the El Mocambo"" are much more representative of April Wine. Canada rocked, we really did. You just wouldn't know it from this pap."
4,Why aren't these guys famous yet?,"What can I say? This is the best ""undiscovered"" band in Seattle. listening to John sing ""her skin Is cinnamon"" makes me crave redhots from the candy machine!"
2,Simple to cook but the recipes seem lacking in taste,"If you consider the target audience and the size of the book, it is OK and by no means intends to be an authority of the subject. It has simple tapas style recipes such as meatballs and tortilla as well as very recognisable paella and empanadas.This is available in places as a PDF so look around and get yourself a bargain rather than the expensive hard copy book (I have the entire library of these books)."
4,Tipped Off,It seems to have pleased my husband because he is an avid pool player and used it on his cue immediately. I bought it because it was shiney.
3,ancient trials,"a good report about how was ancient trials in athenas. in our contemporany world, the ways that the ancient athen proceed his trials may seems odd also their sense of justice."
3,Tonka Tough - literally!,"My boys just love Tonka trucks! I decided to decorate their room with a Tonka theme and figured these sheets would look great in their new environment. The sheets were a hit with the boys but the feel of them are a bit rough. Hopefully after several washings the sheets will become softer to the touch. The design is great and the colors are bright which I like. Overall, a good purchase."
4,"A great book about Mexico, from a mexican","This book was actually written by my mom, it was inspired by the 1994 Mexican crisis. Although the title looks like the one of a suppuration book, this one is more like an essay about Mexico, it's economy, and how Mexicans (and foreigners) may find lots of opportunities of self-employment. The book has being presented in some academic forums, there are two places that pop out, the ITAM (Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico), and the Latin Book Fair in Chicago. So if you want to get a view of Mexico, from a different context, or you want to live there, or you want to invest there, or you want to find out more about self-employment, this book is for you."
4,Worth it for When You Walk in the Room,"The original ""Needles and Pins"" and ""When You Walk in the Room."" The cd is worth it for those two tracks alone."
5,Fantastic,"This is great for full arms and legs workout. Warning, if you are working the back of your legs and standing on it backwards, be sure to hold onto something sturdy so you won't hurt yourself. I love the range of motion with this, I can tighten or loosen the resistance. This is so quiet I do this machine while my family is sleeping. Everyone should get this instead of an expensive stair stepper, and it tucks under the futon when not in use. A+"
2,can't go fast,"The product is based on pump pistons (if that's what they are called...), and the problem is that you really can't go very fast, they just don't ""bounce"" back fast enough. Also, the length of stride is very short. I returned this product."
5,Mystical Message,"I heard this song playing in a Starbucks in Boston, Massachusetts nearly a year ago. Fortunately, the store was not real busy and one of the employees tracked down the title and performer.The message in this song is timeless and the music is mesmerizing. If we understood that life is ""Just a Ride,"" we wouldn't suffer so much.Hope you like the song."
2,"S-U-C-K-S, sucks, sucks, sucks,",I used them for everything and the sound just sucks. I was attracted by the price (which is why they get a 2)but the sound sucks. At high and low volume. I can not recomend them with good faith. I went back to using the speakers that are built into my moniter because they sounded better.
5,a well oiled machine,"everything was as I expected and the product worked great and arrived in good shape, on time, and did the job I needed it to do"
5,Classy China,I purchased this set as a wedding gift and I wanted to keep it for myself. Mikasa is very classy and this set was no exception! Great set!
4,Engrossing for 99% of the way,"PLOT: When a young teacher at a college for women is brutally slain, a student becomes the focus of the investigation. Her confession seems to clinch the deal. But another student teams up with a reporter when she feels the accused student (who seems to be having a nervous breakdown) didn't kill anyone. Suspects aren't too many in a small group of academics, each with an attache case full of idiosyncrasies and secrets.REVIEW: Certainly an easy book to read, with some well-thought out characters, the story zips along from the murder on page 2. Back when this was written the twist was probably more of a surprise, so I felt a little let down at the very end. Plus I thought a few threads begun in the last chapters were left hanging. Not a masterpiece, but still enjoyable."
3,Ana gives us a taste of the world,"""Silueta"" is a delicious album , in which Ana Gabriel's musical curiousities are satisfied here. There are many collaborators from different parts of Latin America , giving Ana a fresh new approach to her music. the production avoids sounding overproduced , and does a good job at it. It is worth a listen."
5,THE ultimate Dora party!,"This 3-DVD box set is jam-packed full of the educational fun that Dora always delivers. Our favorite episode is definitely The Fix It Machine. All of the ""broken"" things that need fixed are just so cute and the fix it machine fixes them all! I also love all of the special features included in this box set. You can play Dora's Big Birthday DVD Game, Dora's Super Silly Search Game, and Dora's Present Search. They're so fun! If your little one is a Dora fan, the Big Party Pack will definitely not disappoint."
1,More info about the author than the victims,I bought this book based on the good reviews. I couldn't finish it because of the boring behind the scene details about the author who was the procecutor and the team who helped solve the case. I kept reading hoping to learn something more about the victim and background of her husband but I gave up. I read a lot of true crime but I couldn't take reading about every thought the author had during this case. This case evidently had a large impact on him but he should have stuck more to the story of the people involved not HIS thoughts and the thoughts of his colleagues. A real disappointment because I always try to learn WHY the crime occurred and now I'll always wonder.
5,Excellent documentary,"This documentary is very well done, and informs you of the history of the 1830s. Warning.... this is a sad story and difficult to watch emotionally. It includes lots of speakers and actors in a professional informative format. As a Tennessean, I grieve for the thousands affected by the racism of those days. This gives a different side of Andrew Jackson and the white southern politicians of those times. You can't help but wonder if there would be different possibilities considered today. This makes you question much about history in general and how we are different today."
4,Trail of Tears - A Native American Docmentary Collection,"Trail of Tears Documentary was very nicely done, it kept your interest and had alot of information about the Cherokee tribes."
3,No closed caption.,"I was so looking forward to this DVD and I am so disappointed that it did not have closed-captioned dialogue.I usually check for CC before I buy any DVD, but I didn't note it this time. I am very disappointed because I cannot understand the dialogue.I watched for a half-hour, but I could not pick up enough words to understand what was being said."
3,trail of tears,"Trail of tears is true documentary of the american indians in the southeastern united states. it tells the story of how the white people along with U.S.Army marched them all the way to oklahoma just to steal there lands many of them died along the way, but thats what you expect from the government in them days"
5,Magical McNaught,"What can I say? This book was perfect. Stephen Westmoreland was perfect! ""Until you"" made me laugh and it made me cry. I loved it. I have read it so many times that it's falling apart. A perfect love story - the ending will have you smiling for days! And also wishing that it didn't have to end. Judith McNaught at her best."
3,3.5 Stars Good But Not Great,"This is the first book I have read by this author. I really loved the herione. She is awsome and someone I would have loved to have met. Sadly, I find the hero lacking. It is not that he is horrible, but he is not quite up to snuff in my book. He sleeps with his mistress after he meets the herione and that is breaking one of my romance novel rules. Also, it is never clear if he got rid of her. I wanted to love this book because of the herione and feel dissapointed about how everything turned out. The ending was typical, if lack luster. In some ways I wish the herione would have ended up with Rafe or DuVille. I am not certain I will read anymore books by this author."
3,"Good characters, so-so love story","I guess I just hate it when some ridiculous ""misunderstanding"" crops up near the end of a romance novel that forces the lovers apart, and miraculously all is forgiven and rectified somehow by magic in the end. It's uncharacteristic of human beings, and really flaws the tale. I just couldn't get past it. Plus I was terribly disappointed that all of Sherry's riding & outdoor talents were barely expressed in the experience with Langford. What a waste. It was also disappointing that Sherry's Papa & Rake show up for one little page in the wrap-up. I kind of agree with the other reviewer who said the real Charise Lancaster should have gotten her comeuppance! What a brat."
4,Until You,"Loved it but wish how things turned out with the main character's families mixing and mingling, their learning about each other's pasts, plus the truth about all the circumstances leading up to the lovers' turmoil would have been touched upon before ending the story."
2,"Didn't love it, didn't hate it either","I loved Stephen in WML, but in UY, he disappointed me. Yes, the love story was romantic, but that's it. Sheridan was too forgiving (There's nothing wrong with a very forgiving heroine, but in this case, it made her somewhat like a doormat). Oh, it was good to see the characters from the other books: Jason and Tory, Jordan and Alex, Clay and Whitney. And also the great Nicki DuVille."
2,Vibrator,"Product arrived in good shape and I was very excited to see the box on my doorstep. I had lots of concrete to mix and this would make the job a lot easier. Unfortunately, it chafed and the provided oil was uncomfortable to the touch. Would not buy again."
2,cracked handles,"For the price I paid I gues cannot expect great quality, but then someone should tell you so you can choose if you still want to pay it even though handles come crakced.They are nice looking though..."
3,Okay,"These knives are okay for the price. It was a gold box deal of the day.They won't replace really high end knives, but if you need a set to get started they aren't too bad."
2,Great Looking But Manufacturing Flawed,"I bought this set because it was a great deal and I desperately wanted a nice knife set. Cuisinart is a well-known and trusted name and with a lifetime warranty I thought it was worth the risk. My set arrived today and 6 of the 17 knives have cracks on the handles at the rivets. Most of these cracks are fairly small in size, with one large one. I worry what will happen when hot water gets into those cracks.This is a great looking set, no doubt about that, and I did only pay $35 for it (the price was $30 this morning), but I am disappointed that so many of the knives are damaged. I have contacted Cuisinart through their website to see what can be done to resolve this, so we'll see. Still, I figure a 14-piece set for $35 isn't so bad, as long as they hold up and don't have the same problem as the others. Just be aware of what you're getting into if you buy this set."
1,Broken handles,"I purchased these knives about 1 year ago, and within 3 months, the handles were beginning to crack. First, just on the small paring knife, but since then 4 more knife handles have cracked. Yes, they are not the highest quality knives around, I believed that I would be getting a better product since it was Cuisinart, and although they are functional, I would not purchase them again."
4,worth the wait,"I put off buying this brand for quite a while. But am glad I finally went for it. To me 3 spoonfuls don't bring out the chocolate enough, so I use 4 or 5. This has great flavor and there are almost no chocolate clumps left after stirring! The flavor is nice and mild (not too sweet). I will definitely buy this again. But am I the only one who thinks the lid and freshness seal are stubborn? I am on can #4 and have had to cut the seal with a knife on 3. I also decided to keep the lid open slightly because opening it at first hurt my fingers. That is my only gripe."
2,"A fascinating read for educators, scary for parents","I think this book should come with a warning label for parents. This book may be fascinating and interesting, but it is too scary for parents. As an educator, I read with great interest. As a parent, it left me in tears, as I contemplated what adulthood would be like for my son with autism.Our knowledge and understanding of autism has changed drastically since the sixties and seventies. It is heartbreaking to realize how the individuals in this book could have benefitted from some of the therapies and teaching strategies that our kids today are receiving.I fail to see how this book can do anything for parents, but scare them. There is little correlation between autistic children raised and educated in the 60's and 70's and autistic children being raised and educated today. The addition of early childhood intervention alone is having a profound impact on the lives of children.There are many other books that offer more insight and hope."
4,A Sweet Little Book That Toddlers WIll Love,"As the title suggests, this is the story of a small lamb attempting to find his home. He encounters several animals who invite him to come and live with them, but Little Lamb knows that the homes these animals live in are not HIS home. At the end, Little Lamb's mother comes and takes him home. This is a rhyming board book, and each page has a cut-out to reveal a squeaky lamb (very appealing to tiny kids!). Cute and entertaining."
1,Weak -- at best,"This ""tool"" comes without a battery or charger. What's more, there appears to be no way to order a battery for it.Got sawdust on a workbench? This thing would *probably* work okay.Got leaves in your front yard? Get a real tool instead."
5,Excellent Overview,"The new edition of this book still is by far the most comprehensive introduction to Bioastronomy, touching almost every branch of science along the exciting path it follows. Remaining firmly grounded in science it shows that reality is so fantastic that it is in no way necessary to fantasize up facts and fictions. Science still is one of the greatest adventures of mankind, and the search for life in space is one of its most stimulating branches. It also is a good motivation for young college students from other subjects to further their knowledge in science - which is necessary because we live in a science dominated world.Stefan Thiesen www.bioastronomie.de"
5,Foundation of Evidence Based Sicial Work Practive,It' s a good reference book. Very useful for thesocial workers managers their cases using a scientific approach.
2,An okay book,"The story was okay and I admired the writing but the main character wasn't very likeable. He was a very negative individual who found fault in everyone else -- especially the Baptists (who the author, apparently doing very little research, confuses with Pentecostals). It was ironic how critical and judgmental he was toward Baptists because he believes they are critical and judgmental. Outside of this acidic bile, this was a fair book. I might read more just to see who the bad guys are in the next novel. Girl scouts maybe?"
2,"Anybody remember ""Murder she wrote""?",That's what this novel reminded me of. A librarian solving a crime the local police can't handle when a lazy DA is ready to charge him. A slightly surprising ending but not worth the time it tok to read.
5,Awesome cd,"Powerful music. Blessed me indeed, I really love the song ""The Prayer of Jabez"" it is very uplifting. God is good."
2,Unreadable,"I was highly disappointed with this scale. You are unable to read the readout while there is a larger bowl on the platform(necessary when weighing 7 or more lbs at a time). Also, the ounce readout is only in ounces, when you have over 7lbs it becomes impossible to quickly calculate how many pounds and ounces you have, as your reading will be something like 135 ounces. My scale also did not weigh all the way up to 11 lbs, instead stopping somewhere around 8 lbs."
5,Briljant dramatic version of masterpiece,A historic performance filmed shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Kogan leads the orchestra in a fast-paced (not too fast) performance of Shostakovich's 10th symphony. There is an option for showing subtitles which describe the development of the symphony and give interesting backgrounds. Highly recommended.
1,Look Closely,Those of you who are looking for literature regarding spanking - this is NOT it! This book is a small collection of short sexual stories with a homosexual bent.
3,I saw it coming but still liked it,I liked this book. I knew what was going to happen from the first few chapters but I liked it. It was different. The writer did a good job.Very contemporary :)
3,Nothing New Here,"This collection is simply a combination of the three previous iCarly releases iSpace Out, iSaved Your Life and iFight Shelby Marx. Since the episodes found on those releases were again released in the Season 2, Volume 2 and Season 2, Volume 3 sets, this DVD release is really not needed."
1,Disappointed,"This item was sent as a gift but was received broken. Because amazon was not the shipper, we could not get a refund, only return and reorder. The only shipper we could find was the one who shipped it the first time and they had poor reviews. The recipient decided to keep it because the cream pitcher was fine."
2,Great stocking stuffer or gag gift,"by Clif ColbyThis review is short, because this book is short. The one redeeming quality of this book is there is no doubts what it is about: a book of playlists. No iPod tips or tricks, no troubleshooting guides, not even history about the songs. The playlists aren't from famous people. This is simply a cute book of sample playlists for different events such as ""Songs for Crying in your Beer"" or ""Martini Time.""This is one of those fun little gifts you see at a checkout...like the mini book that has 6 pages and is 2 inches tall that has different ways to say I love you. This is a good stocking stuffer to elicit a smile or great book for a waiting room at a doctor's office.The book is cute, and that's about it. Sometimes the world needs a few more smilesPros: Makes you smile and chuckleCons: Serves no useful purpose besides making you smile. Nothing particularly iPod related"
3,Good flashlight for older style battery,I broke my old 1990 flashlight and needed a replacement. This flashlight does just fine and is inexpensive. The pivoting head moves one notch lower than the older model so it can stand on the table to have light downwards on what you're working on. It's a nice product and seems sturdy. I'm happy with the purchase.
3,Marin's Mess,"I bought this CD on a whim, being a fan of Depeche Mode and Martin's songwriting skills. When I listened to it, however, I was a little dissapointed. All the songs on this CD were written by someone else, not a drop of Martin's beautiful poetic structure anywhere. Don't get me wrong, the songs are beautifully arranged and performed in a wonderfully popish, electronic style, I just hope this isn't the start of a non-writing trend for Martin. All in all, if you liked Depeche Mode's ""Exciter"", you'll like this."
1,What is this??????,"For a man who can write so brilliantly and has one of the best voices I have ever heard, I have never been more disappointed. First of all, he is a brilliant writer and did not write any of these songs. I was very disappointed and sold my copy before I even listened all the way through. I like the Counterfeit ep he release in 89....this was just too bad! I expected so much more and got a load of garbage. Thank God for David Gahan! Maybe Martin needed to get back with Depeche so we can forgive him for this!"
1,not worth the money,waste of my hard earn money!! paid a little more and get something that might last longer then a month. I learned cheap is cheap!!
2,Baseball hen?,"Not all that bad but not all that good either. The worse parts were the endless description of how Riker puts his knee on this rock and grabs on to something with his left hand to push himself.... get on with the story will you? It takes Riker two pages to climb down a hole!Anyway... I really hate it when an object of great significance is stolen and the event simply cannot go one without it. Ludicrous. How can there be a merger between clans without the fortune's light? Simply unthinkable! Let there be war instead. As I said, ludicrous.High tech band during carnival. Why? Just to get the story going? I see.The endless meaningless baseball was SO boring.Come to think of it, I am going to give it a two instead of a three."
2,Does NOT Last,"We wanted a deodorizing pet cologne that lasted on our dog, especially since he's a water dog. Our local groomer recommended this. I was glad to see in the product description that the scent lasted between baths. I was shocked when it truly only lasted about 1/2 a day on the dog. We can spray him in the morning, and by afternoon, that wonderful scent is gone. He's back to smelling like a wet dog. The scent of this product, by the way, is great. We just wished it lasted as long as it claims!"
2,Too scented!,This cologne has too much scent It made me nauseous - the only good thing is it lasts for ages on your dog.
3,Fair...fair.,"Usually, I don't really cry over Hilary Duff. This song is ok, not the best I've ever heard, but still good. The lyrics are creative somewhat, and her voice fits with this song. Normally, I think the songs she sings should be sung by someone else. But ""So Yesterday"" is pretty good!"
1,ONLY ONE SONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This c.d. only has one song on it! It's really stupid just to listen to one song. You could just go buy the Metromorphosis ablum!
1,my goodness,"So Yesterday and Workin' it Out are good songs. she's got an okay voice. She doesn't have much vocal ability but the younger pre-teen generation will like it because it's ""Lizzie McGuire"". but please people everyone has their own opinion so if you think she's awesome or she [is bad] just leave an unbiased opinion and don't tell people to eat a bean cuz they don't like her."
1,Working It Out?,"Working It Out...now we know Hilary Duff didn't write that song. Work and out are probably pain to her ears. But she can always cure it with a big mac... but anyways working it out is the worst song I ever heard, hilary sounds like a cow mooing over and over again...oh yeah Hilary cow same thing. The only difference between Hilary and a cow is that she eats more! This song is so not workin me.Lets move on to So Yesterday. It seems like she had her mouthful with taco bell while a computer sang her song. This song also sucks.Oh and by the way hilary is so selfish, If she gave one of her fat jubbly arms to the world for thanksgiving no one would ever go hungry."
5,What we all sorta know but don't do!,"I felt that Tim did an outstanding job with this book.""Take A Stand For Your Brand"" is a must read if you provide professional services in the Advertising & Marketing industry. I purchased this book for every member of our leadership team and we just went through our first group work shop on re-branding our firm. It's funny how we all know the information in this book in some fashion, but Tim did a great job in outlining the process for an agency to follow.I hope others find insight, inspiration & success in this book."
2,"Again, in regards to religion, it's right on the money BUT...","for those of us who are not religious, the book has no true useful or parallel meaning in regards to ""our"" everyday life. And as I stated in regards to Every Womans Battle: Discovering God's Plan for Sexual and Emotional Fulfillment, it is RIGHT ON THE MONEY with it's respect from a RELIGIOUS ASPECT, but leaves the rest of us shaking our heads with raised eyebrows of concern."
1,"I nice tour of Hogwart's Castle, but gameplay is LAME.","This ""game"" sucks. The castle and grounds are really well-done and it was fun to explore.... for about 30 minutes; after that, there really was nothing going on but a weak story and a lot of mundane chores. Also, not being to control the camera angle was aggravating on many levels. I often found myself wanting to blast Ron and Hermione for being constantly in the way and contributing nothing. Chamber of Secrets, with the poor graphics and all the cartoonishness was 10 times more fun because it, at least, had some challenge to it. Save your money."
3,Mediocre,"I recently bought a PS3 after not playing video games for years. Since I'm a big Harry Potter fan, I bought this game since it was the most rated among the Harry Potter series. I'm about 60% through the game and the challenges that Harry goes through in this game are mostly ver boring. They're mostly comprised of figuring out ways to climb on top of things and retrieve items. I had expected that the game will provide for some exciting challenges / puzzlers like the actual books / movies do. I would give the graphics and Hogwarts visualization a 4 star, so all in all I think the game is just mediocre. If you can get it for $10 or less, go ahead and try it out, not worth more than that to me."
3,I can never face Snape again since I failed potions. . .he keeps making these cutting comments,"This game takes a LONG TIME, as you have to run across the castle constantly. Also this game forced me to fell a strong resentment for a one, Zacharias Smith, I can honestly say I hate that kid. The castle is oddly laid out as well, not really matching up to the books or movies. Spells are a lot of fun though so it is worth playing, though definitely not $50 worth playing. They also have these weird mini-game tournament everywhere, which I absolutely fail at."
5,Flashlight perfect companion for drill,This flashlight fits in the case with the drill as well as uses the same battery. The flashlight is hard to find a retail outlets so this vendor was a real find. The flashlight can hang from a string or stand alone. It has many different positions to direct the beam of light onto most jobs.
4,you can read this,"You know, I have not even used this. It cam in as oredered, so that is good, but I have no way to rate the performance, so go figure it out. Good luck"
5,Great summer DVD,"Great summer DVD: sweltering Mediterranean scenery, caustic characters (Silvia Miles, James Mason, Rodney McDowell, Diana Rigg), insane costumes, and stinging dialogue. Color is bright and dramatic. Music is snappy and ominous. Lots of sun, water, and strange boozey drinks no one touches today."
5,Agatha Christie Was Never So Much Fun,"Maggie Smith and Diana Rigg? There aren't enough stars for those two hurling barbs at each other. The entire cast is perfection, plus the costumes, the scenery and the music - is wonderfulness a word? It would certainly apply to this movie."
4,POIROT SAVES THE PLOT!,"The first Agatha movie i saw was Death on the Nile with Ustinov.For me who never liked Agatha's work that movie was a challenge,the end a total surprise and it had me seeing it again and again.I tried to saw another Poirot in the Orient Express but i could not.Now about Evil under the sun,i do not know if it is the plot or the direction that spoils the excellence.The music and location are marvelous so is the cast and Ustinov as Poirot,but there is something small lucking the top level as i said.I guess you should see to judge,i believe you should once at least to judge on your own!"
2,Outdated - boring characters,"It's outdated (made in 1982), so the people don't act or dress like this anymore (I was 21 when this was made and I don't recall ""normal"" people dressing like this, not even the swimsuits).It's not a stellar group of actors and I found the characters to be a bore.However, if you like other Hercule Poirot movies you'll probably like this one - it wasn't an easy mystery to figure out. But I didn't care for this movie."
3,"Cats like them, but.....","My cat really likes these, but unfortunately they get lost really easy as they roll under couches and entertainment centers almost immediately. I spend more time looking for these than the cat get's to play with them. I found some fake fur covered bell balls that don't roll around so well which work much better as my cat gets to play with it longer. Plus, if these things hit a hard floor - i.e. the kitchen, they are LOUD! Wow, wake you up in the middle of the night loud."
5,almost can't tell gluten free!,I buy these for my Father he is celiac. i have tried them i am not a celiac and they have a very nice flavor- i do sneak a bowl or two from him. they are very good and i really appreicate the amazon subscribe and save feature it is cheaper and i don't have to remember to run to the store
5,hamstring wrap,The Pro-Tec Athletic Hamstring Compression wrap was EXACTLY what I needed after rupturing my hamstring. I had very little trouble with it sliding down and could move it to the areas that hurt the most on any given day.
5,Essential Kanji learning tool,"This dictionary ranks up there with the White Rabbit Press Kanji flashcards as one of the best Japanese learning tools on the market. Looking up the kanji is remarkably quick, much faster than the Kodansha dictionary I also own. It also goes far beyond the 1945 characters most dictionaries are limited too. Thanks to this, I've finally begun to read manga in the original. This is simply a must-own product for anyone serious about learning to read Japanese."
5,When I Was Puerto Rican: Awesome Book!,"This book was great to read! I enjoyed it so much that I have read it twice. It transported me back to youth in Puerto Rico and reminded me of so many things I forgot about my country. It is a great book to read even if you are not Puerto Rican or of Hispanic-descent. There are some words in Spanish in the book. For those of you who do not dominate the language, don't worry. Santiago does a great job explaining these words in the context. I promise you will not get lost. People often think that it is not important to include these words in books, but they are. It is these words that give readers, like myself, a way to relate to the author in every way possible. This book will keep you hooked! Great book! I recommend it to anyone. My grandmother recommended it to me and I never found it interesting to read until I had to read it for my History class my freshman year. Don't wait for that! Just read it and I am sure you will like it as much as I did!"
4,"Good book, good dog.","This is a really cute book about a very appealing little dog who takes a ride on a raft from California to Hawaii. The idea was to prove (in theory) that ancient seafarers could have navigated from the Americas to the Far East instead of the other way around.The story is told from the dog's point of view, and is for the most part quite realistic and believable. The only jarring note is when the author uses the dog's ""dreams"" to promote the book's unhistorical premise. The illustrations are good, though a couple of them are obvious paste-ups. All in all, an enjoyable read.Reviewed by Kathie Freeman."
2,It almost fits!,"The back and side pieces fit and snap on beautifully. The swivel screen piece, in my opinion the most important piece, keeps popping off. If it doesn't fit my Sidekick 3, it probably won't fit yours, either."
3,Cute but misleading,"Just received these bowls and yes they are cute and a good size. They arrived very quickly and unbroken. However, the description clearly states that they were designed by artists in Pittsburg, THEY ARE MADE IN CHINA. I thought I was buying a ""Made in America"" purchase for Christmas. I will give these anyway, but I am disappointed. That is why I only gave them 3 stars, if they were ""Made in the USA"" I would have given them 5 stars."
1,Total Arabic - your money's worth,"Standard Arabic is a thorough book for Modern Standard Arabic. It is a real challenge to students and is better used with a teacher. The cassettes which can be purchased separately also help by providing reading of the texts, but not the actual word for word vocabulary lists. This book is used as a textbook for my Arabic language class. Difficult, but worth the time and money!"
4,Arabic for a novice,"I think this is an excellent and comprehensive learning tool for novices to the arabic language, to the point it has been recommended in our italian class for Arabic beginners. I would only recommend, pronounciation being one of the difficulties of Arabic for westerners, to add a CD with vocal examples and exercises."
2,A headache of a book...,"""A noun cannot only be defined more closely by an attributive adjective, but also by a subsequent noun in the genitive. The relation of both nouns to each other is that of a governing noun (nomen regens) to an attributive adjunct(nomen rectum) in the function...""If that makes sense to you, and you can use instructions like that to construct sentences, this book will be very helpful to you. It is fairly comprehensive and moves quickly. However, for the rest of us, the dense grammar terminology and the otherwise bewildering presentation of concepts require too much time deciphering the authors' English- much less utilizing it for learning Arabic! Not recommended for teaching yourself."
4,"As always, an enjoyable read from Hayley Ann Solomon","Miss Marianne Spencer-Pultney is a lively heroine who rather enterprisingly dangles her legs out of a first story window preparatory to jumping. She has, of course, first thrown her bandbox out of that same window narrowly missing our hero... Alistair Raoul Griffin Sinclair is the heir to the nasty, miserly earl she is pledged to wed. Since his name is legally the same as the earl's, a cunning scheme is hatched.... This is a mischievous tale with definite villains and three couples who find love. Very enjoyable."
1,Very disappointing,I found this book lacked substance and will quickly fade into the dusty shelves of bookstores.
3,General overview,This book is not bad from the perspective of an overview of basic option strategies. I don't have any complaints but i also don't have any big compliments. This is one of many general option strategy books out there. My only big complaint is the cost -- i think the $60 list price is a bit aggressive compared to what you can get from competing books out there.
1,Just Awful,This just does not work. I followed the instructions to the T and it was unusable. I wound up sanding it all off and re-painting with Ideapaint which worked fairly well. While Ideapaint costs about 3X as much do yourself a favor and use it from the start- while far from perfect it actually works. The Rust-Oleum simply does not work.
1,Crappiest.Paint.Ever,"With hindsight we should have just bought a whiteboard and hung it up. This stuff does not paint on smooth. It dries lumpy-smooth. It takes about 12 coats of paint to make it the right type of surface. Don't bother using painters tape to get nice edges. This stuff dries to thick and hard that your tape will pull off some of the paint which in turn will pull off the paper layer over the dryway. If I could, I'd force Rust-Oleum to come repair the wall that this paint utterly destroyed. Stay away. Far away. It isn't as cute as the picture on the box makes it out to be."
5,Great Intake,"Debated for quite a while over either the Toyota TRD intake or this one. Chose to go with this setup and so far I think it was a great choice. I had to install it in the dark but even at that it was a breeze to install. The only thing that would be nice though not necessary would be a rendering on each step of the specific hardware they ""supplied"" for that step. But again that is fairly petty for anyone who knows anything about mechanics. My FJ loves the extra air and growls noticeably. Certainly would recommend this to anyone looking for a better intake than the OEM. Can't say about mileage yet as I haven't had to fill up, but will edit when I see what difference it makes."
3,"If You're Looking for Portability, This is NOT the Crate for You!","If you're looking for quick setup/tear down with this crate, spend a little extra and get another brand...very cumbersome! My big lab, however, got her head out of it and stuck very quickly!"
3,Pet Crate,"I think this crate is OK. I love that it is super big! However, I don't think it is very sturdy. I'm actually using it for two cats (a safe place for them to go if they want out at night) and it's good enough to keep them contained. But,I can't imagine a Great Dane in this cage, one whack with its tail and the crate would collapse."
3,good size but hard to assemble,The box came with too many parts (extra walls and sticks) and the instructions were not as clear. I guess you cant expect much for only $30. After assemble its great size.
3,Great crate- crappy tray! But we found solution,"This crate stands up well to my 7 great danes. The tray is flimsy, cheap, and cracks eassily under the weight of my danes ranging from 115-160lbs.To make the tray last, put a blanket, rug, anything with cushion between the metal grid and the plastic tray. this solves the problem.I just get fleece from the clearance bin at a fabric store and double layer it between the grid and tray.Sucks that it's so flimsy, but there is no better alternative that we've found, so that's how we make do with what is offered."
4,"A well done, witty, funny, fast paced, must read book!","This book has an intriguing plot with well developed characters. Although this book would be considered a humorous fiction, there were definate moments when the author takes you to the more serious side in the life of the rich and famous. The title of the book, however, is a bit misleading. Perhaps a title such as ""The Boomer Challenge"" would have served better"
4,Superb game if someone doesn't buckle you off at the green,"As the subject says, this game really sucks when you start and whoever behind you hits you off the track every time. It's just stupid, which loses one star.I run NASCAR at great difficulty on a Compaq Presario 5612, PII 350, with 32MB RADEON card. If it weren't for the good old Radeon, I would be with a piece-of-junk sim. Once I get my new 2 ghz Dell, I'll be coasting around Talledaga.As far as I hear, Papyrus Racing has done a bang up job with the previous sims, it was this reputation that led me to buy.It totally defies memoriam by not removing the Intimidator, the late Mr. Earnhardt, but still if you want to race the former prince (Richard Petty will always be The King) of NASCAR, do so.The game was designed very well and can provide a good 2-4 hours of racin'.Buy it, but only for the best computers."
4,just like the book,"nice,standard size desk calendar with quotes from the book - a little plain - black & white and just text although they did vary the fonts."
5,Compelling,"This documentary is a really powerful (and depressing) look at the way women are injudiciously treated in the CA penal system. The system is inequitable to women who commit violent crimes, even if they are predicated by abuse and self-defense. This is a balanced, insightful examination of the CA judicial system's injustices. Would be VERY useful for Sociology classes studying similar systems of subversion/power relations and civil rights issues."
5,We Are In War !,"You need to survive ! So you need to compete, you need to fight.If you can not fight You will die in the battle of life, If you can not compete with others you can not survive in school, Social Life, Career, Market,...You have Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and Threads in your life, If you can not find them, If you can not work on them, You can not survive.You need to use your strength to attack your enemies weakness, You must be wise enough to capture the opportunities before your threads kill you.Life is easy if you now the GAME rules.Be BRAVE and Invest on this book to get the idea of REAL LIFE and HOW TO SURVIVE in this Jungle !"
5,Gorgeous and strange and inspiring ...,"I couldn't agree more with Chris Armstrong that this music is the perfect soundtrack for doing creative work of one's own. I've not only used Robbins' music -- the ""Carrying the Bag of Hearts"" series, especially -- as a catalyst for my own writing, but have used it in workshops I lead for poets, with astounding results ... Something about the dreamy hauntedness of the lyric landscapes Robbins creates, and something about the way the music draws the listener deeper and deeper into the unconscious, seems to release a whole panoply of angels and demons and muses and mysteriously potent creative magic."
1,Rancid,"I live in a remote area where I cannot get these great products. I ordered two different kinds of this cereal and all 6 bags of the oat bran flakes smelled very rancid when the bags were opened. It is not returnable as I later found out. Warning, buy cereal close to home not online, it was an expensive lesson. The chickens will eat well this week."
4,High School Teacher Tips,"Good reference for new teachers. If you want to teach high school students, better read this book to get ideas and suggestions. Read slowly so you can absorb and understand. You have to be brave to handle young adults who can be defiant and argumentative."
1,Available elsewhere for free,All of the material on this DVD set is available for free download from the Internet Movie Archive / Prelinger CollectionThe Medicus home movies are extensive and excellent.
1,Utter Garbage,"Why is there no option for zero stars?Do your sanity a favor and just go buy the manual twist trimmer by Groom Mate. The Remington model trims nothing. After reaming your nostril for a couple minutes, you might be lucky enough for one or two hairs to get stuck in the blades, causing you to wince as you rip them out. You probably won't notice the pain though as you are trying to recover from the intense urge to sneeze from the trimmer's vibration, and the unpleasant machine-shop smell that sticks in your nose for hours.Oh wait, 1 star because it has good battery life."
1,"Junk, don't buy it!","Cheap, doesn't work, piece of junk and a waste of money no matter how cheap it is."
1,Waste of money...you'll just have to pick a new one if you try this.,"Skip this and take the $$ you would have wasted on it and put it toward a better one. This has a cutter and a non-removable shield that, I guess, is meant to keep you from cutting the hair too short. The problem is that the shield is TOO far from the cutter, so I end up with neatly trimmed hair sticking out of my nose. I wore my old trimmer out and it was great...so I know there are better products out there. Trust me, the word ""Titanium"" does not mean this thing is good. The ear trimmer attachment they include is even more worthless than the nose trimmer. If you buy this, you'll be back on here in a few days looking at one you wish you would have bought."
1,"Garbage, do NOT order from discount Jungle.","When it arrived, it arrived with an exploded battery in the package and battery acid all over everything. Had to throw it out. Very disappointed."
5,Great Product!,"I found this product (Remington NEDH-2500) to be beyond my expectations; it is a great value for the price,"
1,Save your money,I bought one of these through Amazon. It runs on a battery that lasts about 3 ear trimmings. It always clogs up.....Junk Junk Junk...save your money and buy a re-chargeable trimmer!
2,Onward to the past,"I should wait till I have more time to do it properly but here it is: I found the book terribly argued. When he writes about subjects that I know about he's got his facts wrong. The writing is disingenuous and falsely profound, and in conclusion is a celebration of irrationalism in what to me is a frightening way."
5,For the Kyle Fans,if you are a Die Hard Kyle Fan like me you will enjoy this.bonus features include the closure that ABC Family failed to give
5,One of the Best Shows I've Watched,"As a lover of Sci-Fi/Fantasy, I enjoyed this show very much. It is a shame it ended with many loose ends. I hope a movie sequeal is in the works to end the series properly or perhaps another network will pick it up to keep it going."
5,TOO BAD KYLE WAS AXED,"We need to petition to bring this TV show back. This show is awesome. Considering that I don't typically get into tv shows - the one that I decided to follow - was axed!!! BAD BAD BAD move. Anyway, now I need to get a hold of the writer of the show and personally tell me what happened next since there's no more season 4!!!!!!!"
5,A Rare and Scholarly Work Rich in Detail and Historic Significance,"Copious and detailed in the extreme, this early American Lexicon is a masterpiece of scholarship and contains more detailed references than one could track down in a lifetime. A pleasure to use, the paper feels like the finest linen, daring the reader to put it down, which, amabo te, do not."
2,UGH.,"The product does what it is designed to do at the cost of quality. There is a lot of ghosting on BOTH channels (my PC & Xbox 360) and I am totally unhappy. I even went as far as replacing my VGA cables thinking mine were bad - NOPE! Turns out my VGA cables were good, it's just the cheap VGA switch.All and all, I am not happy with this product. Do not buy this if you care about quality. And if you don't care about quality, then this is the product for you!Thanks for wasting my time and money."
3,Works but not well,"I put two screens off one PC which is what I wanted to do but....Lots of shadows, reflections, double images. Very poor image quality supported by this. What do you want for $20. Expected."
2,Not Worth It,"My common, everyday house key would not even fit into this. I don't know of a key that would. Maybe a mailbox key or something. I was looking for one that would fit my car key a 97 Honda Civic) as I must park in a very dark spot. I looked up several brands and none of them would fit a car key.Now it doesn't matter as I finally bought a new car that has keyless entry and I also moved and now live in a well lit area."
1,Bait and switch,"I am EXTREMELY disappointed !!!!!!! Picture shows outfeed table, and review says there's an outfeed table, but nb, there is no product description. Item came w/o outfeed table. Many, many calls to Allspares,Inc resulted in being told ""Too bad, send it back if you don't want it"", but this would mean losing $$$$ in shipping costs. They claim that Makita item # means no table, as if the consumer would know that?!? I kept the item, but feel ripped off. VERY misleading!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,One star is still too many,"Another piece of garbage delivered to the public by the main sewage machine that is Hollywood. Of course, everyone under 10 (who have no excuse) will love it, along with the ""adults"" who think that Adam Sandler is talented. Rent this right before you commit suicide and you will be sure to pull the trigger."
5,"Not since ""Becket"" have I seen such an earnest endeavor","I have one word to describe the experience of seeing this movie - floored. Not since ""Becket"" with Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole (chronicling the unsteady friendship between Henry II and the Archbishop of Canterbury in 12th century England)have I been so impressed with performances by two actors. Larry Miller plays the antagonist with such deft nuance a lesser critic would swear he couldn't act, until the climax arises wherein he chews scenery until his gums bleed. Carrot Top steals scenes and hearts with a continuous stream of hijinks, tomfoolery, and shinanigans that makes us laugh until we realize at the end of the movie that he's also taught us how to love. I've seen this movie 74 times and I asked my wife to marry me during the museum scene the 4th time we saw it in the theater. I named both of my children Larry Miller. I can recommend nothing higher, not religion, not culture, not world peace, nothing."
4,We need the DVD!!!,"Where and who do we write too, to get this released on DVD? With so much junk being released on DVD why can't someone do something about putting this wonderful film on DVD?"
4,Just what I was looking for,"My reason for buying these shin guards is a little out of the ordinary. I work in the forest, and was constantly busting my shins on brush and downed trees. These were perfect. They fit above my hiking boots. My shins are no longer bloody and bruised. I'm a happy customer."
2,Ok but the book was better. but both are very disturbing.,"I read the horror book that this movie was based on and I also saw this movie and while the movie has it's effective creepy moments the book was better and went into much more detail about the mystery involving the creepy girl! I did think that the child actress playing the girl was good though, not only was she an adorable moppet who looked the picture of goodness but she handled very well the creepy moments when it was obvious that there was just something not right about her character. She kind of reminded me of the sinister little girl from The Bad Seed! Like the previous reviewer said this movie is very disturbing and of course so was the book which is even more disturbing and I don't think I could ever read the book or watch the movie ever again!"
3,Don't Read This Book First,"To get the most out of Margaret Starbird's personal religious journey memoir, please read her other more scholarly works first. It will be less confusing for you. Otherwise, it is a good read on what one might go through when taking a leap of faith in a completely different direction."
3,They don't look like the photo!,"I purchased these because of the nice wood tops matching my hardwood floors. They look nothing like the photos. The tops are just painted brown (along with the rest of it). They are functional, but don't plan on the nice finish."
3,Get it cheaper and locally at Bed Bath and Beyond.,I bought this product for $80+ and later saw the same exact product at Bed Bath and Beyond for $50 and at WalMart for $45. Ouch!
4,Winsome TV tray set,Previous reviews had indicated the trays to be unsteady / un-sturdy. We did not find this to be the case. The trays are totally functional for the uses we intended them for. The only draw back is that the finish is much darker than what it appears on the image prview
2,Nice but not put together well,I like the size and color of the wood but they aren't put together too well. They keep coming apart arond the legs and you have to constantly put the pegs back into the hole. A little glue goes a long way.
1,representing everything that's WRONG with our culture,"Criminy! Talk about a book fulla nothin'! Save yer dough and buy somethin' useful instead, like maybe some used boxing trunks, or one o' them nice vintage pearloid terlet seats. Sheesh!"
3,"Yada, Yada, Yada","This book is very well written; really, it is. But, geez louise, I'm 77% of the way through it, and, just realized what bothered me about this story. It's a LOT of talk! Not much action, so far. Here's hoping the last 23% makes up for it. :)"
4,Luck at Love,I very much enjoyed this book. It kept my interest and I wanted to keep reading until the end. It was well written and I would like to read more by this author.
1,Boring,"This book was stupid, boring and totally predictable. There should be a sequel to this about what happens to both of them when she realizes she screwed up what she had. It dragged on and on, I actually couldn't subject myself to the whole thing, I skipped to the ending when I was about 15 percent through to see if I was right, and I was, so I didn't even bother to go back and read it all the way through. The characters weren't even likable enough to save the thing."
3,"Not at all satisfied, could use more updating","I purchased this book in hopes of getting a large ""database"" of different schematic symbols. I found this book lacking many of the schematic symbols that I needed, such as thermocouples, circuit breakers, different switches, etc.This book is geared more towards a beginner, on ""how to develop a schematic diagram"" or ""how to read a schematic diagram."" This is prompted by the title of this book ""Schematic Diagrams The Basics of Interpretation and Use."" However, I felt that the author could have included a larger variety of schematic symbols as it's hard to find a great book with the 'right' symbols for me to use in drafting.I'm glad this book cost me under $20.00 used, as I don't feel I have any use for it."
3,Don't Start Here,"Maybe don't start with de Lint at all. He's one of the authors, along with Tad Williams, whom I keep trying to like because they show so much promise. Both Williams and de Lint create fascinating premises, which, in my opinion, are undermined by often painful dialogue and *slightly* lacking characters. That's just me, though--if you enjoy Williams, you'll likely find de Lint a worthwhile read. Everybody has different ""must haves"" and for me it's character/dialogue over plot/premise.Regardless, this book shouldn't be your first de Lint experience because it's a sequel of sorts to earlier work. It *does* stand on its own, but you should check other titles and reviews for a first time recommendation."
4,"Great, but limited capacity","This is a great recorder, but the capacity is somewhat limited. The other reviewers are right that the lowest quality setting is almost unusable. There, is, however, a DW-180 model that is not that much more expensive. I assume Amazon will get it sooner or later (if they don't have it already). The best feature of this recorder, aside from its small size, is the automatic date and time-stamp feature. A lot of recorders have this, but then again a lot don't. It really makes all the difference."
3,Great Value,"This is a great, simple digital recorder. It is small, light and fairly durable. The companion desk top software is simple, useful and reliable.I use this recorder to keep track of what I do all day. I merely make a recording and it keeps track of the date and time. I then transfer the wav files to my PC in the evening. I listen to the files and write it down in the evening. That way I can accurately keep track of what time I spend on each matter (I bill for my time) during the day. My bills are accurate even when I can't write it down at the end of every day.Only demerit it gets is the relatively short recording time at high quality."
4,"Better as a 30 min, recorder.","Overall, a good recorder. But for practical purposes this product can really only be used as a 30 min. recorder. The long play mode, which allows for 90 min. of recording time, is really not that great. The recorded sound in this mode is so poor that it is difficult to comprehend even if it was simple dictation. All the other modes of recording do so with very good fidelity."
3,"Pretty good sound, missing some features","I was actually pleasantly surprised at the sound quality this unit gives, considering that there is no way to attach an external microphone. If you look on the Olympus website, you'll see that the DW90 has a sampling frequency of 22 kHz in HQ mode. That's better than the norm of 8 to 16 kHz that many others use (although not as good as something like the DM10 or new DS-2, which record at CD quality 44.1 kHz). The frequency response is only 300 to 5,800Hz, so I wouldn't try recording a symphony, but that's comparable to many of these voice recorders (again that DS-2 actually covers 100 to 17,000Hz. Impressive). If you're willing to download to PC frequently and don't need to capture more than 20 minutes at a time, it's a pretty good little device.It's also impressive that even after my wife dropped the recorder in the bath, it still works. Now the batteries don't last long, and I can't rewind, but everything else works great."
1,Anti German Bias in everything,"I think the Nazi women were very fashionable. Leni R, Eva B, MAgda G. All were well dressed attractive chic women. Whats with this anti German Bias in EVERYTHING. Im sick of it. Im starting to think that most of these Germanophobes have some other agenda. Like they fear any sort of study of the real purposes and motives of German leaders. Ay compliment is always tempered with...""but oh the holocaust"". Give me a break. More than half of American whites are of German ancestry. Our national language narrowly missed being German. All of this anti German stuff started about the same time as the Zionist movemnt started. Like I said..hidden agendas. I like Germans. There Ive said it."
4,Lotta spice and a lil punkin,"Just as ""moist"" aka oily as other NP granola bars, and slightly less tasty, but still a great pick-me-up treat."
2,Meh...,"Takes a long time to put information into it. It only worked for about 6 months. The buttons fell off, and they get water inside. One stopped working altogether, and the other just displayed jibberish.Great idea, just poorly designed."
2,Not helpful at all,"I had a c/s earlier this year and have struggled to accept it. So I bought this book thinking that it would help me come to terms with it. However, I felt more upset after reading it. The reason I had a c/s was never mentioned (baby was posterior) and it doesn't discuss any of the discomforts I experienced afterward, such as burning and tingling of the incision line for months afterward. If I had read this book prior to my delivery it would not have prepared me any more than I was anyway. This book did not explain anything that watching one of the TLC shows such as ""Maternity Ward"" or reading magazine articles. Pass on this one!!"
3,"Waiting, waiting, waiting but Gadot never comes","Not as good as I thought, a lot of repetition. It's like listening to two idiots talk all day about nothing and waiting for someone (Gadot) to save them from their miserable lives."
2,pointless,"the entire play was on the pointlessness of our exsistance, of our waiting for an answer from somewhere (Godot, God, or whatever other translations you wish to put on it). But with the lack of development from the characters, and so much room for interpritation that one can never be sure of any of the finer points, it made for a frustrating read. In fact upon many any point that this book was attempting to make would be compleatly lost. It is in my recomodation that if you wish to read a book on the futile and pointless life that we are living, pick up ""L'Estranger"" by Albert Camus. And after all that I'll sit back and laugh at my self, for sitting and reading this, waiting the whole time for something to happen in this bloody play."
1,"Dumbest ""classic"" in 20th century literature","I first read this work as part of my Humanities class in high school. I reread again after college to see if several years of ""higher education"" would make my mind more receptive so great works of literature. Both times, I thoroughly hated this play and consider one of the dumbest pieces of literature commonly taught in schools. The plot is overly simple; two hobos (probably European) await someone (probably male) named Godot. Several others pass them by during their wait. Godot never comes, and the play ends right where it began. No introduction and no conclusion. However, there are supposed to be many meanings that can be had in this story. A common one is that Godot is God, and the hobos represent humans. This reviewer's opinion is that the plot is so simple, that one could draw whatever conclusions or meanings they wanted out of it. All in all, I did not gain anything from this work. Fortunately, it is short enough to get through quickly."
3,Was there a point to it?,"Ok, the book makes you think. I give it that. But there was very little story line, and it was all nonsense. Ok, and I did laugh, but I still think it could use some more plot. I guess overall you can say that I liked it, but at the same time, was Beckett writing a book of complete nonsense? What was the point? Put it this way...if you're looking for something to read, and you don't care what, read this play. If you want some real meaning, read it anyway just so you can write a review and email me what you think!"
5,Strictly and Deliberately Constructed Absurdity,"After reading only twenty pages, I was too tired to continue to read, because every conversation requires the strong concentration on its analysis. All conversation is composed of some particular intervals, some adequate distance between characters. Its role is to confirm the identity of the mutual intention or the absence of the mutual hostility, or to tranquilize the anxiety about the misunderstanding.I wonder why this novel is called as absurd after analyzing these correctly constructed conversations. The unconscious behaviors in their conversations, for example, the pause, the interval, and the distance are composed to understand their unique characteristics. This concern about the unconscious has already been manifested at his first work of ""Murphy."" The important thing is not to interpret the logic of the conversation, but to read the meaning of the unwritten."
5,Connecting the past with the future,"Just a quick note for any of you educators who are thinking about assigning this great piece of literature that explores the human experience. Christopher Guest's recent movie, Waiting For Guffman, is a fine companion piece to Beckett's play. Guest-of Spinal Tap fame and fortune-does an excellent parody based on the same context of this play that exposes the ridiculous stereotypes developed by American culture."
3,For the intellectual,"Godot is not bedtime reading. I'm not even sure that it can even be considered pleasure reading. Is it great literature? Yes! What Beckett does with language and the lack of language--the silences, the pauses--is extraordinary. Don't think that you can just sit down and read through this play and ""get it."" As with all plays, the experience of engaging the play as the member of audience is paramount. Three stars only because this is not a play that is to be read in silence."
3,Most reviews for a totally different product! This is not a CD drive!,Most of these reviews are for a totally different product!This is a floppy drive not a CD or DVD drive!
5,The Doubleday Cookbook,"This has been my favorite cookbook for years and years. The chili recipe is worth the whole book. Always find info or a great recipe. Friends, family and even strangers love my cooking. Without this book I would be lost in the kitchen. Thrilled to find it again. My original is falling apart at the seams. Kind of like the Velveteen Rabbit. Worn from years of love and cooking."
4,Fast for clearing out cooking odors,Clear blades are a nice touch. They let light thru but block the full sun strength.Thermostat works nice to shut it off when it cools down at night.Quiet low speed setting. A little noisy at full speed.
5,good deal,"I bought this to replace the ultra-worn-out chainrings on my used mountain bike.Some of the teeth seemed a little irregularly shaped (they weren't all the same shape). I'm not sure if this was a factory design or flaw.Regardless, it's a decent enough replacement and my chain no longer slips like it used to. The chain guard was an awesome plus."
2,Strictly for children...,"...worse still; for politically-correct parents who think cultures must be sterilized. Lots of pictures but the word ""beer"" is never mentioned. What sort of Oktoberfest book is that?"
5,Excellent Router Bits and Great Service,Woodline router bits are always of excellent quality and finish and this set is no exception. I have used them for a long time and have always been extremely satisfied with them. The cut quality is excellent and the edge seems to last forever. I have never had a problem with any of them (and I have quite a few) but it is good to know that Woodline has the lifetime warranty on their router bits if I ever need it.
2,look somewhere else,only engine is good i think. cheap built. i got it cheap but not happy with performance
4,The good and the not so much...,"I love a good bar of soap in the shower. Grandpa's Patchouli soap delivers on one level and disappoints on another. For lather and scent, it gets five stars. Unfortunately one round of use demonstrates how far one bar will go, and that's not very far. Made up mostly of coconut and palm oil, with aloe vera gel almost at the bottom of the list (beat out only by essence of patchouli), even short showers and conservative use will eat it up pretty quickly. Great soap as far as it goes, but I'd prefer a bigger bar or, more to the point, a recipe that doesn't dissolve quite so easily."
1,"Somewhat Helpful, But Overall Vague","This book did highlight some great points about the purpose of women. However, it mostly focused the whole book on Adam and Eve. I wish that it would have included more examples of other women in the Bible because obviously the story of Adam and Eve does not talk about her relationship with other people. It briefly discusses Proverbs 31, but pretty much skips the part about her working selling clothing and other items. There are just so many more excellent examples of women in the Bible that are overlooked in this book. I agree that it is the woman's highest calling to serve her husband, but I also believe that the Lord calls us to many other things (this is not mentioned). I would not suggest this book if you have been educated because it makes several vague accusations against different fields of study that are innacurate and invalid arguments."
3,Number Devil Not for MAC,"I was disappointed that, in spite of the label saying it would work on a MAC, it didn't. I contacted the US distributor only to learn they were not expecting any more MAC versions. I have seen and played it on the PC though and loved it. I have a granddaughter who is using it and truly enjoying it and learning Math. I do recommend it."
4,Good film,"I liked this movie, but not as good as the 2nd one. With the series finished now though, Inuyasha adventures live on through the movies...I hope there are more to come. This one was like an extended episode. After watching the last episode though, I had to see more...so i did view this in Japanese with English subtitles, and it's just like looking at the English dubbed versions. There's no Kagura, but you see a little bit more into Inuyasha's personality. Sesshomaru (sorry if i messed up the spelling) is the here too...which is great because he's a favorite...so if you are a fan, i'd say definately watch this."
5,InuYasha The Movie 4 - Fire on the Mystic Island,"I think this is the best InuYasha movie by far, with the 3rd coming in close for second. If you love InuYasha - you will love this movie!"
5,Best Price ANYWHERE!,"Newly released and a discount price unmatched ANYWHERE. Shipped and received exactly when stated, and the quality of the item was perfect. This is a must have for any serious Inuyasha fan, and collector. Clean enough for most children and enough depth of entertain even an adult."
5,Visually the best Inuyasha movie yet!,"Visually, this is the best Inuyasha movie yet. Perfect, flawless animation. Storywise, it's probably my second or third favorite, behind Swords of an Honorable Ruler, and perhaps tied with Castle Beyond the Looking Glass. My fave character is Sesshoumaru, and he makes enough of an appearance to satisfy fans of him or his crew. The half demon kids are apathetic and annoying, but Inuyasha makes up for it by beating them into line again."
3,Well researched,Very interesting to read of local reactions to the murder & how it may have influenced opinions of the day.
4,Midnight Assassin Review,"Thhis boThis book is a definite must read for anyone interested in un solved mysteries whether current or not. I had never heard of this murder, but once I started reading could not put it down. I found the family interaction fascinating and the treatment of women at that time an eye opener. Anyone choosing to read this book will not be disappointed."
3,It's Okay a Little Slow for My Taste,"The book was a difficult read, but had it's moments. Not much has changed from the 1900s to today in regards to human nature."
4,Good snapshot of midwestern society 100 years ago,"Farm life in the midwest was difficult for the pioneers and their followers. The lifestyle of the women was beyond difficult. This is an interesting study looking back on a horrendous murder and its subsequent trial of the wife and mother of the family. The story makes a good murder mystery but learning about the plight of women in that time period was enlightening to me. It also reveals how people from small towns are reluctant to talk . . . good book, outside of my usual reading interests but I enjoyed it."
3,If Only Starman Were Here Today...,"Starman (Ken Utsui) flies in from the Emerald planet, just in time to battle the evil, disembodied brain of Balazar! Look out! Hordes of mutants and mad scientists are out to assist Balazar in his bid for world conquest! Will Starman be able to defeat these hideous creatures? Watch as he jumps, leaps, flies, and does some sort of kung-fu dance routine, all in the name of a free and peaceful earth!..."
5,Desert Island Book,I sometimes compose lists in my head of the ten books I would take to a desert island and Toothpick House always makes the list. I read it maybe 20 years ago. I would advise anyone thinking about giving this book a try to read a few sample pages. I think you will be hooked and want to read everything else Lee Lynch has written.
1,don't buy if running Windows 2000 or XP,"This is a good, cheap printer for Windows 95/98/ME users but Windows 2000 and XP users need to use a beta Win2K driver (v0.22) that is not very reliable. Since all new computers are now sold with XP I would not recommend this printer for use with a new system until Minolta/QMS releases a reliable, non beta driver."
2,Fades,"I really liked this design and color, but after a short while, the silver changes to grey and it fades away. What can you say, cheap."
4,just right,I really like this watch cap. It just fits my bald head and keeps me warm on these cold winter mornings we are having just now. Shipping was fast. I'm well satisfied.
3,the right color but doesn't cover my ears,they are kind of lumpy looking in person. I bought a couple of the coyote brown ones and I ended up giving them to other soldiers and spending the extra money on an OR coyote brown Wintertrek hat.If you would like to know something specific about this item just ask and I'll try to respond within a day or so.
3,"Warm, but thin.","This watch cap is similar in design as those issued to service members, but much thinner with only a single layer and with lower quality stitching.The hat, however, does do it's job and keep your head warm as long as there isn't too stiff of a breeze."
2,One size does NOT fit all,This is NOT you're standard issued GI polar fleece hat. It does not match the issued watch cap you get from the military. It is a different design. The tag on it says one size fits all. It's a LARGE sized hat.
1,Terrible,"If you have a head three times the size of a normal person, then you'd be happy with this watch cap. But if you're like every other average individual, this watch cap is so big it's pointless to even wear. The Rothco brand fleece cap misinterprets the idea of ""one size fits all"" by making the biggest size possible. Don't spend your money on this--return shipping costs as much as the product so you'll just swallow the purchase and throw the thing away. Find another brand."
3,Good Book,"Its a good book for folks who want to plant bromeliads in their garden. It has an Australian slant to it, but the information can be used world-wide. Worth the read."
4,Good speakers.,"They're great little audio monitors. The audio sounds full and rich. I notice that they do get crackly at high volumes, which others have noted. I also don't believe they get loud enough."
4,Very Useful For Small Studio,"I bought these for my auxiliary video editing station. The sound is very natural, and there's more than enough power for a small room-with no audible distortion. I recommend them for semi-pro or amateur video editing and sound design. Only one problem; the included computer-to-speaker cable and the speaker-to-speaker cable are way too short for most installations. Most folks will have to buy or make longer cables."
2,"Great, til the right speaker suddenly stops working","Bought this, set it up at my workstation, and never moved them around even once. Used them several times a week, not quite everyday. After about 6 months, the right side wasn't working at all.I looked for help online, and I came to realize this was some kind of known fault with the product. It happens to a lot of sets, and a lot of people. You'll even find plenty of reviews stating the same thing. I was out of warranty, so I had to eat the cost of a new one. I honestly think if you see positive reviews on here, their set hasn't broken yet, it's a ticking time bomg.Now I bought the m-audio av-40's here from Amazon, for about $130. They sound so much better. They're bulkier, but richer, deeper sound. Skip these and go straight for the av-40's. Don't even consider the av-30's, what's a few more bucks? You won't be sorry."
1,Defective out of the box,"M-Audio is a decent audio company, however, in my case the speakers simply would not power up when plugged in. I can only assume a bad transformer, which happens sometimes - so I'm not saying bad speakers or bad company, just bad luck. I have heard from audio professionals though that these speakers won't cut it as real studio monitors as they just won't give you real reference bass tones, but for $100 what do you expect? I have also heard that they are going to be much better than any other desktop computer speakers assuming they work when you get them."
1,Poor evidence of sources,"Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat provides a rather feeble excuse for her limited bibliography and fails to provide adequate citations for many of her assertions. There is an obvious French slant on history throughout the book. And in some cases there appear to be insertions of ""local legends"" or Francophile dreams for which there is no other evidence than Toussaint-Samat's statement (i.e., fabricated quotations attributed to Charlemagne's biographer in the cheese story on pages 116-117 - look it up!). In a generalized, broad-spectrum work such as this it would be all but impossible to check every fact. But, that being said, the book contains hundreds if not thousands statements of fact and her uncritical (at best!) inclusion of information for which there is no evidence in the source cited brings the whole book, as an authoritative source, into question."
1,Pretzels by the Dozen by Angela Elwell Hunt,"This book is advertised as a counting book. When I read a counting book with kids I expect to read the text, then count the items in the picture. This illustrator did not read the text. For example. It says ""3 open windows . . "" There is 1 window. It says ""8 bakers..."" and there are 2. It says ""12 pretzels . . upon a Christmas tree"" and there are 5. I would not give this book even 1 star. It should be recalled."
5,Made in Greece,This is an excellent compilation of Greek world music compositions and performances by different artists. Its a must have for those who enjoy world music. I'm planning to collect the whole series
1,Not worth it,"I was excited to receive this product, my other tips were not suitable for pavement walking. Unfortunately the quality was poor. I have used them less than 2 weeks and the tips have no tread left on them.I have ordered a new pair, ones that are nordic original in hope that they will last a proper amount of time."
2,Went down hill very quickly,I was a huge fan of the show when it started. I loved the idea because it was different and i loved the cast. But then things just got out of hand. Everything with Ben and Amy is just too weird for my liking. Her parents have some serious issues and half the time i wonder if Ashley is going to run in front of a bus. It just seems like this show is a bad season of 7th heaven now. I saw a preview for the next season and the kids all skip because two of them do. That is exactly what happened in a season of 7th Heaven. I dont think i'll be tuning in any longer. It's a shame such a good idea ended up getting ruined in the end.
4,love,I love dealing with them. I got my dvds in a reasonable amount of time and was able to watch them shortly after that. the only thing I didn't like is that I bought 2 seasons and they charged me S&H for both separately instead of putting them together.
3,the other 20 percent....,"I'm 55, work a very demanding job 50 hrs a week or more and often ""on call"" for emergencies after hours. I also am the sole care provider for my mother who is suffering from Alzheimers and my father, suffering another form of dementia. Life is somewhat stressful at this point so I was looking forward to finding some help on surviving this difficult time with some ""self"" left when it's over. A few pages into the book the author gives statistics stating that 80 percent or more of elder caregivers are women. From that point on almost all references to the caregiver refer to ""her"" and things that women can do to help manage the process. Well, I'm part of the other 20 percent. As a guy, I had difficulty relating to many of the suggestions/comments and though it's probably a helpful book for women, I gave up about a third of the way into it and have moved on to searching for something I can better relate to."
3,Weakest of the Series (So Far),"Sound quality as with the others in the series is surprisingly good and while the songs are all fine early garage & psychadelic rock, these are just more average than the others in the series - no hidden or fun gems like the others. Unless you were in one of these bands or you're just a completist collector - you can actually skip this disc and not be missing much."
5,A wonderful read. Too close to home for comfort. I love it!,"Fortunately or unfortunately this story mirrored my own all too well. The love that develops with trust, the clarity that is found in honesty with and to oneself. The simple beauty and kindnesses found between the covers of this book have in a single day worked to scrape away layers of doubt and to shed rays of light where there was a darkness. I told you, this was too close to home for comfort. Like so many things that I've discovered or uncovered recently, I found The Bachelor's Cat to be ""exactly what I needed, when I needed it"". ""The shared experiance heals both."" For this I thank Mr. Hoffman as well as for the warm story itself. I'm sure Mr. Hoffman will be glad to hear that I too, can no longer cast pearls before swine. And yes, my cat received some extra food and strokes tonight. Guess he approves as well."
3,On the small side,"My doctor recommended these, in fact he sent some with me to use so I ordered the same product. It turns out the ones he gave me, although packaged exactly the same were bigger. They both say medium size and have the same product number but these are smaller."
5,The best!,"When it comes to alcohol swabs, these are the best. I have tried many different brands, some have to much alcohol, some not enough, others the swab is to thick or thin. These have the best balance!"
5,What I needed,Need a whole bunch of these to remove finger print ink from fingers. Came as advertised and same stuff I use at a hospital.
5,Great handy product to have in your daybag,"Handy prepackaged alcohol wipes a great bulk price to have in your bag. Bought these so I can have them readily when needed. Like getting a scratches, poke self with needle, paper cut at work, etc."
2,didnt send the items i ordered :(,"I ordered the red and whote kendall alcohol preps and was sent the blue and white ones. these are smaller and imo not as good as the ones that I thought I was getting. I would have appreciated knowing this, then would have waited until what I wanted was again in stock/"
4,New Spin,"Top class cyberpunk. If you enjoy the type of taut, electric prose and ""of course you know what that means"" attitude that made Gibson and NT Stephenson famous then you'll love this work. Its smart, stylish and enjoyable from front to back.Spin State"
2,Could have been better,"Spin State starts off great but then suffers from two major problems. Before I get to the problems, I want to say that the pros are great. The author has a nice writing style and was fun to read on that basis alone.But there were problems. First, there are too many characters and frequently a minor character will appear and the reader is like ""who is Ramerez again?"".Secondly, the tech in the story is not explained well. I honestly have to wonder if the book was edited in terms of content and and in terms of understandability. Towards the end a ""World Mind"" emerges which was not justified via the story or explained in terms of how it would emerge. I have to say that this almost made me laugh towards the end."
5,Fantastic First Novel,"C J Cherryh's Union-Alliance novels were clearly a big influence on Ms Moriarty. Add a touch of Heinlein, a touch of Vinge, a dollop of MacLeod and a goodly helping of Richard Morgan style noir, and you've got the flavor of this first outing in a future history where the economy is based on quantum entanglement and the rare material that makes it possible.Catherine Li is caught in the middle. More than a few middles as it turns out. There might be no one she can trust. And all she has to do is defang a crisis that threatens a civilization-wide war (or worse) if she fails and the mere genocide of her homeworld (and an incidental xenocide) if she ""succeeds."" Luckily she hates her homeworld. Then there's this AI who's stalking her (and that's an ally). And the murder of her twin, only nobody's supposed to know it's her twin, but nearly everyone seems to. And then it gets complicated.Great fun, and there's a sequel coming out late 2005 called ""Spin Control"""
2,SOME OK,"The batch I got was not round and the paint was blooby. Some worked. I think some other brands of paint work better, but you may get lucky."
3,delightful spoof,"Everything you think you know about Dracula is wrong. Vlad is actually a noble soul who just happens to be a vampire. He loved Mina and was just trying to help Lucy. Jonathan Harker was a boring young fool and Van Helsing was a fantical old fool. Whew! Fred Saberhagen takes an axe to the vampire legend and it almost works. The book is silly, funny and at for whole chapters quite witty. It doesn't take itself seriously and neither should the reader. Enjoy the laughs."
4,Quadratini Lemon are great!,"My wife loves these little wafers, but our local stores no longer carry them. Amazon to the rescue! Great product, fast shipping. We are very happy and will continue to order these."
1,Poor Taste,The whole point of a cookie is for it to taste good! This product tastes little better than wood. Sorry I wasted my money. Do NOT buy. Save your money -- they are not worth the calories!
5,"A great buy for ""to-become jazz lovers""","I bought ""you must believe in spring"" on vynil when I was 20. Some 18 years later, I still consider it as one of my best buys, in a collection of roughly 150 jazz CD's and 75 vynils. Buy it ... and fall in love with jazz."
2,FALLING APART,"comfortable boots, I wear them everyday for 10-12 hrs a day.. They are starting to come apart on the side where the gortex meets the leather.. You would figure they would last a bit longer??"
4,Timberland Men's 18193 Hiker,"A very comfortable shoe which was easy to break in. I have another pair in a different color, I already was familiar with the product."
4,Good boot,"This is the second pair of these boots I have owned. They are very comfortable on my feet and waterproof. I haven't had any problems with these boots. I wear them for daily were, hiking and some hunting."
1,Admittedly,"Admittedly, I was looking for style rather than function, but just know that it DOES NOT look AT ALL like it does in the picture. Notice there being ""Green"" in the description and there not being any green on the shoe except for the little tab at the top of the shoe. No, I'm not color blind, the photo-shop artist changed the shade of the picture and well, they did a good job."
5,Quality boots,"These are what I work in at the hospital. They are durable, comfortable and are well made. These are my second pair"
2,"Great fittng, but design flawed","I have had two pairs of these . They fit great , are light weight, and tractible .Gore-Tex is truly waterproof; waterproofed leathers aren't. The problem I've had with walking three or so miles a day is the fabric insert .Although these are stitched well , the fabric is cut short and not folded over and hemmed when sewn into the leather , so after several weeks the fabric becomes internally frayed and pulls out of the leather through the stitching on both pairs ; so I know it wasn't just a fault with the first pair .That's too bad , because I really like the fit and comfort.There is a similar shoe with leather sides and no fabric -but they aren't Gore-Tex."
2,"HURT MY FEET, BUT COULD BE ME","These might be great boots for most people, but not someone with my specific foot problems. I get very sore spots on the outside mid sole area of my feet. If a shoe or boot has a seam in the same area (the cuboid bone) like this boot, they function more as a torture device than a foot protector."
3,Did not meet expectations,"Bought the boots in September. On the plus side this is a comfortable boot, sized right and very waterproof. Negatives include, had to replaced the laces because the eyes have sharp edges that destroy laces. The boot is also very warm with no ventilation or air flow that you would expected from Gore Tex. This is not a summer hiker."
1,knock off boots not timberland,the boots are knock off's they wore out in 8 weeks soles wore thru came apart very unhappy. very bad boots
5,An outstanding collection!,"Joy James has collected a great group of essays from engaged academics and thoughtful activists dealing with a wide range of issues related to the prison-industrial complex. The best way to convey the content is probably to list some of the essays: * Robbie Meeropol, ""Testimony"" (of a Rosenberg son) * Dan Williams, lawyer for Mumia, on the case * Manning Marable, ""Black Radicalism & an Economy of Incarceration"" * Angela Davis, ""From Convict Lease System to Super-Max"" * Adrien King, ""Black Women & Gangs"" * Luana Ross, ""Imprisoned Notive Women & Importance of Native Tradition"" * Alexandra Suh, ""Military Prostitution in Asia & U.S."" * Gabriel Torres & David Love, ""Militarization of Police in U.S."" * Gary Marx, ""The New Surveillance"" * Jose Lopez, ""Political Incarceration"" * Donna Willmott, ""Time to Bring our Political Prisoners Home"" * Judi Bari, ""Earth First! & FBI"" * and a dozen more"
4,A great singer for a great price!!!,"In this quality CD, Ana Mar√≠a Mart√≠nez demonstrates a palettes of colors that clearly shows her mastery over the voice. Her ability to sing such diverse repertoire and keep an artistic consistency throughout the recording is to be expected of her.Been myself a double bassist, I didn't quite appreciate the repertoire selections for this recording, although I loved the standards. Otherwise, I have played in the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra while accompanying Ana Mar√≠a, and I have always been astonished by her exquisite musical taste and how it shows through her voice. A great buy!!!"
5,"Gorgeous Pictures, Great Story","This book is perfect for all the little ones in your life. The pictures are wonderful, the story engaging, and a happy ending."
3,A Children's book,This book was written and designed to be read to a 5 or 6 year old child. I don't understand why it would be available for purchase on a kindle which is clearly an adult device.
5,A damn fun book,"This is one of the most captivating books I have read. Though some criticism maintains that it isn't exactly a literary work, it is definitely a great read if you want to take a break and have some fun. It's the type of book who makes nonreaders want to read. Definitely thrilling, my favorite from grisham thus far."
5,5 star all the way,"John Grisham has a way of capturing the readers attention, I could not put this book down at all!For people who like mystery with the touch of today's problems instead of some magical lands, then this book is foryou"
2,Rip off ending.,Starts off pretty well but the more I read the worse it got. The ending was totally bogus. In the beginning I was wanting to know more about the characters. It could have been interesting. More depth of character. Didn't get it. The characters are one dimensional and get old quick. Like a novelized version of a not great movie. Quick read though.
5,A very good & entertaining book!,This was the first book by John Grisham that I've read and I must say it was worth it. The storyline is original and we can sympathize with the book's main character. I would definitely recommend this to all book lovers.
1,A book that says: Is it worth my time to read fiction?,"Many people say this is a ""happening book."" My opinion is that it was pathetic, unrealistic, and not worth your time. I am only 14, but trust me, there are many other, good books in the world.I say this because books like this have say to me- It won't make a difference if I read it or not? Why waste time on imaginitive trash?. It isn't real.P.S. I also apolagize for my negitivity. I am also sorry if I offended anyone or lowered anyone's self-esteem.-THANKS FOR READING MY REVIEW.""The REVEWIER"""
4,"Great Story, Flawed Social Message","A great story which keeps the suspense up right until the end as you wonder how the protagonist is going to escape his predicament.One aspect of the novel which I think somewhat flawed is the way that Grisham is trying to package a social message. While I agree with his message, that lawyers and some other white collar workers enjoy enormous privileges of which they often are not particularly conscious, this message is here blurred by the fact that in this case, these privileges are justified by the shady activities the Firm engages in. Furthermore, after all his lamentations about his ill-gotten privileges, ultimately the protagonist opts for a life of wealthy retirement rather than working for the betterment of society (as opposed to, e.g., the protagonist of Grisham's later novel _The Street Lawyer_).However, this flaw does not detract much from the reading enjoyment in this highly entertaining novel."
3,Post TV show,"After watching the TV show, I had higher expectations from this novel. I understand the TV show defines events that would've occurred after the completion of the events of the novel but still disappointed.I'm a huge Grisham fan and perhaps that leads to my disappointment as I expected better."
2,"Fun story, TERRIBLY written","I admit, I was sucked in by the plot. Grisham has a good story here, but his WRITING! I honestly think that a high school freshman Creative Writing student could have produced better, more interesting prose. Boring, repetitive character descriptions, an extraordinarily limited vocabulary, sentence fragments galore...For good lawyer-based fiction, I'll stick with Scott Turow-- he tells a good story AND tells it well."
3,Expensive And Most Info Is Online For Free,"I subscribed for a year at one hundred bucks. My mother-in-law and I both enjoyed reading it but, to be blunt, we didn't get that much enjoyment to warrant the price tag. By contrast, we adore VANITY FAIR and can't imagine life without it. I spend a lot of time on my computer and I am always plugged into the internet. I have also set up igoogle pages where just about every source on the planet has a gadget and listed items. I have an entire page devoted to entertainment and another entire page devoted to news. There is not much that I don't get right away through all the sources I have put on those igoogle pages. This made PEOPLE superfluous. If I'd been offered this magazine on a renewal for let's say a quarter of what the subscription costs, I might have taken the renewal. With the internet, however, gossip comes a lot cheaper than this."
5,celebrities *,People (3-month)i'm house bound and love the People mag. to see what is going on in Los Angeles my home town.
1,NOT RECIEVING MAGAZINE,"I WOULD GIVE THIS ZERO STARS IF I COULD. WE HAVE HAD A SUBSCRIPTION FOR A MONTH NOW AND HAVE ONLY RECIEVED ONE MAGAZINE. SEEING HOW THIS IS A WEEKLY PUBLICATION, THAT IS NOT A VERY GOOD INDICATION..."
2,Disappointed,"I have waited two months for my first issue of PEOPLE. I have yet to receive it. Hopefully, it will be here by the end of this week! PEOPLE's weekly issues is exactly what I've wanted. I hope the issues I've paid for will be just as informative as those I have read at the monthly news stands."
4,A guilty pleasure?,This is a great easy enjoyable read. Keeps you updates on the entertainment world in quick articles and great pictures.
4,The Bishop's Keep kept me interested,"I greatly enjoyed this book. There were a few typographical errors; mostly, I suspect, from some form of conversion from one format to another, but very minor. Kate Ardleigh is a very believable character and makes a great heroin. The author painted the settings and lifestyles of the storey well and you felt as though you could almost smell the puddings and spiced apples of 19th century English countryside dinner tables. I enjoyed the book so much that I have already purchased another of the series and look forward to reading it."
4,You must be Livingston~,I've have read other books about this trek into 'darkest' Africa plus the movies. This version ranks right up there with the best. More than just a story of the search is tells us a lot of the mind set of the Victorian Male and the craze the whole era had for exploring in general.Great read.
3,Might benefit from an abridgement,"While the value of this book for historical research is unquestionable, I found the account to be often somewhat tedious to slog through. Stanley must have felt the same way on many a grueling days march. Parts of the book were quite interesting, particularly to me those portions dealing with Stanley's meeting with and association with David Livingstone. I listened to the Audible Audio unabridged version of this book and found the narration to be good. The printed book might be a better choice for the casual reader as one could skim over less interesting portions of the book more easily and any maps contained therein might be of some help. The average armchair adventure reader might prefer to check out Tim Jeal's ""Stanley"", a book I highly recommend."
1,very dissapointed,When I received these flip flops I was very excited and was saving them to wear to an Island Party thinking they would be a huge hit especially for my Martini girl friends... unfortunately --- only one of the sandals blinked the other one was fine. There is no way to get inside them to adjust anything so there is nothing you can do - Now they are just expensive regular flip flops . I would not recommend them and wish I had saved my money.
4,A good read!,"This book contained an abundance of intelligent and practical information. Having read other books in this genre, I found Latz to have a unique and interesting style of presenting information; the book not only kept my interest, but kept me smiling as well. I have made it madatory reading for all my purchasing managers."
5,Cool and Crazy,"This possibly is the best in the ""Las Vegas Grind"" series -- at least the best since the first two vinyl volumes. Overall, the album has a more soulful feeling than the others. ""Washboard Part One"" is particularly great."
5,'A' That's Capitol 'A'mazing,"Limited Edition Gimme Back My Bullets. Awesome! Amazing! Great from beginning to end. ""Extra"" audio tracks are great. The bonus DVD shows the Band in a near flawless performance. The ""Standout"" - just how UNDER-RATED a guitarist Allen Collins was. He plays ALL Leads in ""Freebird"" (as well as leads in other tunes) and makes it look so effortless and easy. Again, just awesome."
5,Great book,this is a great book about a linguistic issue so problematic and difficult. the reading is very easy
5,Part of a Training Course,"This film along with Kenneth Blanchard's, Leadership and the One Minute Manager : Increasing Effectiveness Through Situational Leadership, comprised a course that was often used in the 80's and earlier. The situational leadership templates taught in the book were then tracked against this film. The exercise was to observe the leadership styles and subordinates maturity and the effectiveness of their interaction. This was a course given to the Royal Airforce Officers in the UK for decades - an RAF commandant friend saw it hundreds of times in this context.Get a copy of the film and book and treat yourself to a home study course that would have cost you $100's at a public event.What's learnt from the film and book is very powerful stuff when applied to the workplace in any context."
4,"Great Movie, but extras are MIA!","Someone missed a great opportunity by not placing any extras on this dvd.Since this is a ""realistic"" (rather than ""Action"") war film, that takes a serious look at strategic bombing and the demands of leadership in WW2, it would seem natural to have some documentary extras about air power, strategic bombing and daylight bombing in that era, biographies of the men who the characters were based on, information about the B-17, and interviews with real aircrews and commanders.Like other reviewers, I watched this film as part of a leadership & management course. This is another area where some great extras could have been added.It's a great film, don't get me wrong. It just seems natural for Fox to put some effort into the presentation. With the wealth of newsreels, training films, and data for use in special features, it is a shame there are none."
3,Twelve O'clock High,"I liked it but I would have liked the edition where he received orders at the last minuteto go to B29 Wing as I severed in the Wing (315th) Armstrong Commanded on Guam. How comenobody ever made as a follow up.Sgt. Spring, Richard P315th Bomb Wing VH502nd Bomb Group411th Sqd.Did you that the Piolt of B17 jut in another 25 mission flying B29 to Japan"
2,Sad,"I loved Blue Harvest and have watched it probably 100 times. Something Something Darkside was horrible. I hope It's a Trap (Return of the Jedi spoof) follows the lines of Blue Harvest, but avoid this one. It seemed like they were trying way to hard to be funny and yet they failed miserably."
3,Not my favorite Family Guy or Parody of Star Wars,"But it was alright. Definitly funny in parts and Stewie made for a good Darth Vader. Just could have been a lot funnier I think but I am being picky perhaps, I just prefer Robot Chicken parodies of Star Wars to Family Guy. Or regular episodes of Family Guy. Or Family Guy parodies of other things. I guess they just fell short on this for me. It wasn't bad it just wasn't great for me."
5,Awesome!,"The movie was in awesome condition, shipped fast, and was what I would expect if I had purchased it from the store."
5,Loved It,"I loved, loved, loved this episode when it came on television. As soon as I found out it was on dvd I bought it. I loved the bonus digital copy. I put it on my ipod. Great movie, great price. I watch it at least once a week."
2,Worth seeing... once,"First, I will say that I am a HUGE family guy fan. I have Vol 1 and Vol 2 of them, and have all the episodes memorized. I heard my friends talk about the movie, so I had to buy it and see it for myself. Overall... I did laugh... sometimes... but it was all ""eh"". If you are a die hard fan of the old family guy, you probably won't like this movie that much. If you are just an average person who doesn't follow family guy that much, then you'll probably like it (because a lot of my friends aren't big into family guy, but they loved the movie). The movie has memorable moments, which is why I would suggest seeing it once, but over all I wouldn't waste the money on owning the DVD. Borrow it from a friend or something."
4,Great stuff you will never see on TV,"This is a great DVD. Most of this will air on television eventually but extremely cut and censored. This is worth picking up, but the bonus features are not that great and the commentary is mediocre."
2,Wait until your neighbor buys it & borrow it from them.,"As mentioned in the beginning of the DVD, ""in a short while you'll be able to find this DVD in the $3.99 bin at your local truck stop!"". And that's exactly what you should do.Just like the CD, it's their way of trying to pry your hard earned money out of your pocket.If Macfarlane wants to make money and keep his audience happy, keep it to the half hour shows and add the smut to them when released in box sets.Only being 88 minutes, I found this to be long, boring and drawn out.Don't run out to rent this either. Wait until your list of chores takes you close to the rental store. With the price of gas these days, you'd be upset at yourself for making the trip."
2,"False Advertising, Plus So-So Episodes","First off, just a note to let potential buyers know that this is NOT a feature film (ala The Simpsons Movie). Instead, it is a collection of three episodes (""Stewie B. Goode"", ""Bango Was His Name Oh"", and ""Stu and Stewie's Excellent Adventure"") released in a very mis-leading ""feature film"" format.If you are a fan of Family Guy, then this disc will appeal to you much like any of the other collections (although I consider the three episodes in this one to be nothing but ordinary). If not, though, then don't dish out the money thinking you will be watching a feature film and getting sucked into the series' crazy, over-the-top, sometimes insulting humor."
4,Too darn funny,"OMG I hurt after watching this, it was that funny. My only complaint was the song and dance sequence that ""Obi Wan"" does (the old man). It could have been way shorter. Other than that it was perfect."
1,1 star,Take half the humor of a regular episode and stretch it out for 3 times the length and this is what you get.
1,Stick to the episodes!,"Crap-o-la. I don't know what the other viewers were thinking. The episodes are much more entertaining. If you are curious, definitely rent first."
3,"False advertising, false marketing","The film itself is very funny, and on par with the series. What makes me give it three stars is that this was released (and sold to people) earlier this year as a movie - not as an early release of their season finale! I actually saw the finale on TV before seeing the DVD and, while there are a few extra bits at the begining and end, it is essentially the same as what I saw for free on TV (albeit with comcercials - but isn't that what Tivo is for?).This to me seems very lazy on the part of the Family Guy crew, and smacks of false advertising - nowhere on the DVD packaging does it say anything about this being broadcast on TV, and at no time during the TV broadcast was it mentioned that this was the censored version of the DVD.Bad, bad, bad."
2,the untold story,"let me state right off, i am a HUGE fan of ""family guy"". But this dvd is uniquely unlike any other of the series, in that it is just not funny. Boring is the kindest word i could label it. i think i may have chuckled once throughout the show. I virtually never re-sell dvds (especially of family guy) but i did re-sell this one within days of watching it cause i didn't want it taking up space on my shelf. i sold it for two cents, my apologies to the person who brought it as two cents was two cents too much for it."
3,Meh,"I was really excited to watch this DVD. I love Family Guy and I thought this would be really funny. I guess I set my expectations a little too high because I didn't find it all that funny. Don't get mw wrong, there were times where I was laughing so hard, I was crying. But overall, it was kind of disappointing. There were a lot of ackward points in the plot that didn't really work. It seems like some of the plot could have been edited out and the DVD could have been condensed down. For me, the first 30 minutes or so were marginally funny, but I almost turned it off. It gets better after that. It starts to flow a bit better in the middle and finishes strong. The beginning almost ruined it for me though. I'd say if you're a fan of Family Guy, you should definitely buy this DVD. Just don't expect too much."
2,Disappointing compared to the show,"In my opinion, Blue Harvest is disappointing compared to the TV show. I was impressed with the way they stayed with the basic Star Wars storyline, but I think it hindered some of the writers' typically brilliant humor.Matt Zarnstorff"
2,Bait and Switch,"There is only one reason that you can download this movie only once to computer; GREED!!!!!!! When Family Guy came back after hiatus I was really excited. The last two seasons have been almost unwatchable and completely different writing. My circle believes Seth is focusing more and more on American Dad (which is fine with me) so you see the quality suffer. The movie is ok, well thought out, but the kick in the groin is the one time only download. You would think they would treat their loyal fans with a bit more respect. It really left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't think I will be buying any more FG merchandise, and for that matter, I'm selling the first 5 volumes of FG to rinse the taste of bitterness. Any takers?Chunx"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This was a terrible movie!!! Don't waste your money. It has none of the Family Guy humor. I think I might have laughed once. Technically it is done really well as far as the animation and following the scenes from Star Wars. They could have done a much, much better job with this movie, it had alot of potential. For the most part it was just boring, so I guess its a good thing this was not very long."
2,"Um, yeah..not so much","I am a rabid Family Guy fan. I was just like you guys staying up late at night watching Adult Swim watching re-runs and laughing at each joke as if they were new. When I heard the movie was coming come I was one of the first to order. I was completely excited, told all my friends. The movie finally came.But then I put the DVD in.Um, yeah..not so much. It was such a disappointment. It's like having two bad Family Guy episodes pasted together, and badly. I couldn't recommend it to anyone, but if you are a rabid fan you already have it anyway."
5,Freakin Brilliant!,"This is Freakin Brilliant! As a major Star Wars fan, this was truely the BEST parody I have ever seen! Everything was perfect, from the opening sequence to having every scene perfectly matched with the original John Williams score, combined with some great animation and the funniest final assault on the Death Star you will ever see, this movie has it all!I wasnt a huge fan of Family Guy until now. McFarlane is a genius.Ok Robot Chicken rocks too!Be aware this is a bit racy at times and certainly not for younger kids!Overall this was awesome!"
1,Absolutely Distasteful...,"Dear Reader,I'm not here to bash this film for the sake of it but in all of truth mankind ever told, this has to be one of the worst movies I have seen this year. Do not watch it or like me, you will never wish to watch animated comedy films again. The best part of the film was the end because you knew the torture was over. This movie lacks sense of humor and induces more yawn than rib tickling comedy.Rest in peace, Family GuyI'm not watching the show again.PS - Im not lying , this is really sad."
2,Don't buy it.,"Hello! Many of you may have seen the Dateling show where they were teaching their babies sign. I know some sign language but didn't think to use it with my baby. But when I saw that show I started using simple words for everyday thing with my 13 month old. He started picking them up in 2 weeks. Words like milk, cracker, medicine, eat. But there were alot of food words i did not remember, so I ordered this book. I ordered it thru a book club, and not at the book store, so i did not know the contents. I am very sorry I did. I Know about 75% of the signs in that book, and I want to say that if I did not know them, I would never been able to do them by reading the illustrations in this book. They are not clear at all and do not have any written disciption of how to do the sign. Signing to my son has made a difference, less crying, he cannot talk yet but he can let me know what he wants. But please spend your money on another signing book"
2,Mediocre Neofolk w/crude mixing and production,"In my opinion, this album could have been a lot better had the artist been teamed with the right producer. I enjoyed BDB's ""About a Boy"" soundtrack and bought this with high expectations. This record just doesn't live up to it's hype.If you liked About a Boy, I'd recommend Elliot Smith's XO - produced by ""About a Boy"" producer Tom Rothrock."
3,Beast actually only has about 35 minutes,"3 1/2Ambitiously comfy slab of agreeable folk-adelia and glistening pop-rock which can bare no shame does have a sketchy third quarter (well pretty much, a stronger first side is glaring) and a few derivative off-ramps, but the lengthy bewilderment of a debut was to become a once promising songwriter-arranger's most ambitiously intriguing offer."
5,One of BDB's best,This is one of BDB's best works. Many songs remind me of the Beatles.Matt Zarnstorff
2,not for me...,Found it bland and boring. I didn't see anything particularly innovative or intereresting about this album.
4,Pissing In the Wind,"Simply a beautiful album. I can't state in words how this album made me feel the first time listening to it all the way through. Its hard to tell whether its joy or despair, but the point is this album makes you feel. 'Epitaph' Still gets me to this day when the birds chime in and he sings ""Just Promise That you'll try."" unrequited love is somewhat of a button for me and that song pushes it hard. Another standout is 'Pissing In The Wind' almost a tongue-in-cheek rebellion song that upon further investigation (I mean looking past the title) is really more universal than funny. The reason this album isn't a 5-star album is because of its consistency. Songs like 'Body Rap' and 'Cause A Rockslide' are cool concepts, but don't really flow with the goal of the album. However, overall this is a standout album from ONE guy! he plays 8 instruments at a time (I believe thats the correct number). That's talent."
4,Wow - who'd have expected this?,"I heard the track ""Theme Song from The Turtle"" on pandora.com. Really creative and a nice groove! I'm adding this CD to my shopping cart!"
2,Snake Oil,"I used this with a grout brush, diluted and full strength. Improvements were marginal at best. I get much better results with baking soda and water with less scrubbing."
2,Diappointing,"I purchased this with the hopes it would clean the grout in my newly purchased home. The previous owner had carpet under the tables so there is a distinct difference in grout color. It help to clean a little, but not as much as I had hoped."
3,Tried it...,"I have some grout stains that I haven't been able to get out. The grout is quite new (months old, not years old), but mold stains started appearing in the hotter summer months probably due to humidity. The grout is between small tiles in the bottom of a shower. I've started leaving the shower door open after showering so that water can evaporate before a mold colony takes hold, but it appears this is too little too late.I tried this cleaner with a grout scrubbing brush (I don't own the steam cleaner) based on the reviews here. I have tried a number of other methods and I have to say the only thing that partially worked was to put straight laundry bleach on the tiles using paper towels and letting it sit there for hours. The problem with this approach is that bleach discolors the grout and the mold seems to come back. I hate to say it but the only likely solution is to re-grout with a mold resistant grout.Three stars because I believe this product does work for some people."
4,Excellent Beginner Polish Resource,"I have been teaching myself the Polish language, and have been using Rosetta Stone, Pimsleur along with some dictionaries and phrase guides.I saw this for such a low price that I figured I would try it out. It is very nice for beginners because it has an audio button so you can hear that word being spoken in polish. < very helpful>I installed it on my Windows 7 machine with no problems whatsoever.For beginners this is a very nice resource."
3,Plan to make time for these receipes,"This book was touted by Bobby as being focused on ingredients that you would find around the house and easy receipes that don't require much time to make. While that's not exactly the case (many receipes call for ethnic type spices) you can probably make due with subsitutes that you have on hand. What you'll really need to make sure of is that you have plenty of extra time. Most of the receipes are very extravagant (although relatively easy to make) and require that you either spend a lot of time make the dish that day or plan several days in advance to make the sauces that go with his dishes. All in all, I'd say a decent cook book. Not one for every day but one that will allow you to make some meals that you will be able to impress friends with."
1,they're big pills,they (the manufacturer) identify them as tablets but they're big capsules so if you can't swallow big pills - you wont like these. I thought they were round tablets that I'd be able to swallow but NOPE so I'll never know if this supplement works to burn fat and boost energy as it's supposed to
1,"Sorry, Jay Floyd Hasn't A Clue","I wish that I could just say a few choice words to convince Christian haters that the Bible really is God's Word, and that the Cross is more important that you can imagine, and you would all believe me. I knows that's impossible, so I'll just say that on that Cross, Jesus died for all the sins of every person in the world, even the sins you haven't sinned yet. Anyone who believes this, confesses that they are a sinner, and turns away from sin and towards God will be forgiven and live forever in Paradise. The stereotypical portrayal of Christians in this film is completely ludicrous. We enjoy sex as much as anyone, for example, and anything not forbidden in Scripture is allowed. Don't go to church? You don't know what you're missing. I wish you all knew how much Jesus loves you, with ""agape"" love (look it up), and He isn't that guy in this flick that says ""oy vay"" when the crosses fall. Rather He says ""Take up your cross and follow Me""."
3,Baby tends to roll off - at angle,"This product is ok. My 3 month-old son sleeps on this every night and he is slightly elevated which probably helps with his GER. However, we usually find him in the morning at the bottom of the pillow turned sideways with his head near the crib railing because he manages to roll his way off of the pillow at night. I think it would be better if it were slightly concave so that he couldn't do this."
2,a mess to use,"This thing is impossible to open without spilling coffee. The inner cap leaks, so even opening just the outer cap promises a mess on your clothes or floor or desk. I give it two stars because whatever coffee doesn't end up on my pants seems to stay hot enough."
4,Radio Shack picture viewer,A nice portable unit. I was able to slip in in a bag and take it with me to show off pictures on my card. Wish it took batteries...would be even more portable.
1,I got old,I loved this movie the first time I saw it several years ago so I bought the VHS copy. I could barely make it through the movie this go around.
4,Bobcat is underrated!,"Shakes the Clown is a wonderful example of a dark comedy that will make you laugh your ass off. The accompanying cast of Florence Henderson, Adam Sandler, Julie Brown, and Conrad Blake make this film a soon-to-be cult classic. Don't miss the one-liner by ""Aunt Esther"" from Sanford and Son. This movie got overlooked because ""Hook"" was released at the same time. And we all know how good a movie ""Hook"" was. Trust me, you will not be disappointed when you watch Bobcat at his best."
1,disappointed,"Rich Man Poor Man was a great miniseries, for the time. However, I now find the quality of the filming very poor, and the acting minimal. Also, watching segments made for TV was better suited for this cut. Finally, I looked for months for a version to play on my DVD player. I finally gave up, and ordered a ""multi country"" DVD player. When the RMPM DVD arrived, it was able to play on my DVD. The business that sold me the new DVD player would not allow me to return it. Expensive movie, huh."
1,Disappointing purchase,I could not play it in my bluray player because it shows an invalid region code- very disappointed in this purchase-I have spent my last money on amazon
1,Do NOT buy these pans!,"Please do NOT buy these pans! I recently bought these, and the pans SEVERELY pitted after the FIRST use! I called Cuisinart to inform them of the situation, and they told me that I was out of luck, and that they would not take the pans back. What lousy customer service! I will never ever ever ever order another Cuisinart product again!"
5,Best value for your money. Quality set.,"Thanks to everyone who left feedback previously - I was skeptical about the quality of these pans because the price is so great in comparison to similar sets. The feedback helped me in my purchase. Well, I love, love, love this set and will be buying more pieces! These pans are quality construction and cook fabulously. After using them they still look brand new! Definitely go with this set over the classic set if you can.......it is worth the additional money. They are heavy, all metal and, not that it matters, but VERY nice looking. These pans do not stick (as long as prepped properly) and heat well. I use them on a lower setting than I have with my previous pans which is an energy savings to boot. I was contemplating a more expensive set for months and bit the bullet and purchased these instead and I am so glad I did! You will not find a better QUALITY value anywhere."
4,Best set of pans my wife and I ever owned,This is the best set of pans my wife and I ever owned. Very easy to clean. They continue to look just like a mirror. Great purchase.
5,Feel Like a Pro Chef!,"Was very skepticle when purchasing, I was brought up on the non-stick pots and pans, but I have to say ""WOW""! The set has good weight to it, and as the description states, cook on Med. Low to Low heat. Pans heated evenly and very quickly, much to my surprise, and were a snap to clean. Even after big Thanksgiving meal, stuck on remains of gravy melted away with a little soapy water. I suggest also purchasing some Bartenders Friend to keep the set looking fantastic. The ONLY downside is that since the lids are also steel, they get as hot as the pan you are cooking with (found that out the hard way with a massive blister!). Make sure you always take the lids off to check your dish with a pot holder."
2,There are better choices,"After one week of using these pans, my wife insisted they be returned. I said we should use them a little longer because I really liked their looks. The problem is, cleaning. I have to use cleanser to scrub them after each use. Unfortunately, some stains remain even after scrubbing. I finally gave in and bought my wife one non-stick pan at at a local store. This pan is a pleasure to clean so I use it too. The lesson here is ""listen to your wife when she doesn't like something""!"
2,Why We Went To Non-Stick Decades Ago,"The only positive thing I can say is that this set is eye candy. There it ends.You live and learn but this is why we went to non-stick decades ago. Plus, these are crazy heavy which adds nothing to their cooking ability. As a 6'2"", 200 lb, Marine veteran, I'm no weakling but the sticking and weight is just to frustrating.Food tastes so much better when made with love. Love is out the window with this cookware."
5,The best set of pans I've ever owned!,"This set of pans is the best! You can tell they are of high quality as soon as you pick one up! I hope to have this set for a long time! I've made eggs, white sauce and pasta in them and the clean up is a breeze! My last set of pans was non-stick and I will never go back! Stainless steel is the way to go! The set is a little more than I planned to spend but I love them and I cook quite a bit so they will get their use and then some!!! I highly recommend them for someone looking for a quality set that will last!"
5,very happy with the set,"i am no expert- but i love to cook and this set has survived a few 50 people parties with lots of cooking-and plenty of every day cooking- it is attractive and easily cleaned. My reltionship is just begining but so far i am reallysatisfied.I researched this purchase intensively- and I think it paid off. If you like nice things that will last, at the best price, I think this is a good purchase. i am coming from a hodge poge of pots- I definately noticed I need to use less heat with this set-a good sign- so far it feels like a major upgrade for a comfortable price."
1,Not recommended !!!,"I was really excited to get this set, after 2 months of use I simply hate them!! The first day I used the saucepan, it not only sticks like crazy its hard to scramble eggs on it, it also cut my finger really badly (the rim of the pan is sharp as a knife). After two months I am stopping to use them as it's impossible to cook, fry or saute in those pots and pan, everything burns and sticks. This is the worst product ever!!!!!"
3,"Nice cookware, except for the ones with spots","Two of these pots developed dark and light spots inside the pot. The rest were fine. Seems like inferior steel might have been used. Also, things stick to the saute pan regardless of technique. I cooked professionally for 15 years and know how to use a saute pan. I have an All Clad Master Chef that's over 20 years old. I can flip an omelet in that pan without it sticking. In the Cuisinart saute pan, it's a struggle to sear ANY meat and not have it stick. Guess I'll keep using the All Clad for real cooking.Despite the spots, I do like these pans. They're heavy, and feel good and solid. The lids are nice too. Too bad Cuisinart cut corners somewhere in the manufacturing process. They used to be a consistent, top-quality brand. Not so consistent any more."
5,Never Give Up Hope,"This is a book for anyone going through a difficult time. It gives insight into the minds of why people do what they do. It also shows how reaching out to others in need can transform lives. Very inspirational. It seems as if the topic would be very depressing, yet I found it to be quite the opposite. I think at some point we all contemplate our own death, and this shows us how to do it with courage, fortitude, and faith in a loving, merciful God."
4,Very good for the AK neophyte,"If you are not familiar with AK and have some anatomy and physiology knowledge, this book will do. It has everything you need to know with a good section on muscle testing."

1,I couldn't wait to finish it........,I couldn't wait to finish this book and I don't mean that in a good way. This was my book club's selection for the month and it was one of the worst books I have read in a long time. Pointless and depressing short stories. It seems as though the author is just trying too hard to come across as cynical and irreverent.Save your money there are a lot better collections of modern short stories out there.
4,Beautiful but complicated,I ordered the cabinet and it came quite quickly! Unfortunately it was defective. Amazon was great and immediately sent out a replacement and picked up the defective cabinet at no additional cost to me. When I got the new cabinet it took forever to assemble. The screws aren't great quality but once you get them in the cabinet it is beautiful.
2,Incomplete Order,"Was excited to share this toy with my grand children, but disappointed in only receiving nine jacks, instead of ten. Packers must not have noticed hole in side of packaging before shipping. For the price, I'm upset."
3,Transformer,"My son loved this toy when he first got it. It is fascinating that they came up with these things that transform, but the novelty wears off pretty quickly. I don't think my son has touched it since a week after he got it."
3,"quality is meh, but you get what you pay for...","I go through a lot of hats, so cheap hats are the way for me. These will work. The only problem I had so far is that the tag was sewn in sloppily so the ""white"" tag stood out on the black hat."
2,Look good but very uncomfortable,"The shoes look great, but the leather is very stiff, which makes the whle shoe unflexible and the upper rim is actually cutting into my foot when walking. Tried wearing it in a bit, but doesn't help."
3,Not intended for the consummate PR expert,"To the point, informed and rich in examples. Excellent if your are looking for a quick overview of all that is needed to run a PR department in a company. Extremely useful for those who haven't a clue on what's PR and how relations with editors work. Also interesting for those who want to be reassured on their main tasks as a PR exec. But if you have a degree in journalism or already have experience in PR and media relations: leave it."
1,A Real Disappointment,"I studied the guide for two weeks straight and successfully completed the review test at the end of the book with a 90% average. However, when I took the CLEP examination, I discovered that only approximately 20% of the material presented in the study guide was actually on the examination. I was very disappointed and now I have to re-take the exam because I didn't pass. Heed my warning - find another book if you can!"
4,So Dumb It's Funny,"This movie has kind of got everything in it... a little comedy, a little action, a little romance, and a little adventure.What is it About?:Joe Dirt is about a white-trash trailer guy who gets lost at the Grand Canyon when he is a kid. He works at a radio station as a janitor. He is called into a radio show and tells his life story. He tells you about what he did trying to find his parents and inspires the entire world. ""Life's a garden, dig it"". In the story you learn about how he went through life with nothing but a dog and a friend. In the end there is a twist that will surprise everyone.This was a hilarious movie. It's worth buying because I've watched at least 10 times."
5,thank you,"came fast n was in great condition...thank you so much....its a funny movie, gotta love the fireworks stand part....thank you"
1,Doesn't Deserve A Star,"Joe Dirt is an udderly boring comedy about some moron, who was ditched by his parents at eight. David Spade suprisingly did a nice job, but the plot was horrible. Between the perverted comments and retarded jokes, Joe Dirt scores lower than dirt on my recommendations. I truly feel sorry for David Spade because this will completely ruin his image. A radio talk-show host gets Joe to spill his life's sad story over the radio. Joe starts off by him being ditched at the Gran Canyon when he was eight. The movie continues as Joe runs into: A copy of Hannibal Lecter, a country girl named Brandy, a witness relocatee (gets him in big trouble), an Indian dude, and a large collection of other completely strange things. Joe Dirt is a complete waste of time and should not be considered a choice when selecting a movie to go see."
4,My 2 cents...,"Well, me being the type of person with a screwball sense of humor, I found this movie quite enjoyable. Granted, it was slow at first, and I was actually annoyed with my husband for dragging me to the film, but after a few minutes I began to enjoy it. There was even a moment that I teared up....and it wasn't even PMS causing the emotion. LOL! All in all, a good time.Oh, and I found the Silence of the Lambs thing HILARIOUS.... ""It puts the lotion on it's skin..."" : )"
4,"I KNOW ""THEY"" SAY I SHOULDN'T LIKE THIS MOVIE, BUT....I DO!!!","Silly, stupid...ridiculous! Yes, you could say all of these things about ""Joe Dirt""! You could also say it's funny, hilarious and damn good entertainment! This movie will grow on you with repeat viewings. A good cast and a story with some heart make this one tough to dislike. The DVD transfer and extras are very good."
1,EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY! There is a BOMB in your VCR!,"NOTHING to say about this pathetic attempt. It is just plain bad. The only redeeming feature was that Christopher Walken is ten times as funny as David Spade! Every scene is truly apalling and the Joe Dirt character is annoying and TOO stupid to be a lead. The Joe Dirt character must have been directly stolen from the janitor character from UHF, and that guy was WAY funnier than Joe Dirt! Let me get this out of my system: JOE <Freaking> DIRT IS NOT FUNNY. PERIOD, END OF STORY.I was AMAZED when I came to this page to review this movie, of how many positive reviews this got. WWWHHHYYYYY?????????I would be a savior ... to whoever reading this review that hasn't seen this movie to say SAVE YOURSELF AND WATCH A CLASSIC LIKE THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION!Zero Stars out of 4"
3,BITTER GRAPES,"I enjoyed both the story and the writing in this book. I have met Silas House and know some people who know him very well and we all think he is a nice, charming man.I believe ""Dalton"" may possibly be an ex- or fling that ended bitterly (and I think I know who he is, so stop it). Mr. House's personal life isn't what this forum is here is to critique but the product that is being sold."
5,Double-breasted Suit for Tarzan,"By the time ""Tarzan's New York Adventure"" went into production, Maureen O'Sullivan wanted out of the series. Producer, Frederick Stephani appeased O'Sullivan by basing the main setting of this film in New York City. This allowed O'Sullivan to wear a more fashionable wardrobe than audiences were used to seeing her in. Tarzan and Jane travel to the ""Stone Jungle"" to rescue Boy from a circus owner bent on displaying him as his main attraction. A highlight of this film and the series is the big city trial for custody of Boy and an ensuing police pursuit of Tarzan. It all ends happily however! This was one of the best critically received Tarzan films. It was also MGM's last. Producer Sol Lesser brought Weissmuller's Tarzan over to RKO. ""Tarzan's New York Adventure"" is one of my favorites. No, it is my favorite."
3,Wonderful as anti-Nazi propaganda but failed as film,"Powell and Pressburger made great films, they were artists of the art of cinema. I am the first to regret to write this but the well-intentioned aim of the film: to rouse anti-Nazi feelings in America in order to help the British against the German nazis poses too much stress on the film itself.The cast is great, great actors; great scenery. As propaganda it is hardly possible to do a better job in exposing what Nazism means and its implications in our daily lives (religious and civil liberties), and it brings to bear in mind the lucky we free peoples are in our imperfect democracies, so we can appreciate our freedoms more. But again, this aim is too stressed, it becomes too obvious in the dialogues and all through the film."
1,Darned if this could make the cut on even Lifetime or The Hallmark Channel!,"It's like that well-known line on that antacid commercial: ""I can't believe I ate the whole thing!"" In this case, I can't believe I sat through all 120 minutes of this bland cabbage soup looking for any redeeming chunk of beef. Theresa ""the saint"" had about as much character and persuasion as overcooked spaghetti, and Inez's attempt at slick edginess seemed overdone. Not to mention the nauseatingly awkward sexual references which I'm sure were thrown in only to garner a more mature rating. There was no LIFE in this film whatsoever, from the wooden dialogue to the flatness of the waltz contest. It was impossible to enjoy even for what it was; I recommend you at least rent this before you clear space in your movie collection."
2,not very descriptive,"The book, Calculus, by Roland E. Larson provides few examples on how to complete calculus problems. This is not a good book for first year Calc students. The book does, however, provide decent visual aids. That is the only reason for the two star rating."
3,"Not the worst text, but hey, it's Cal!","This text has an interesting layout with occasional informative bios of relevent theorists, but is full of errors and monotony. It's for sale in the auction section for less than half the list price."
3,"Your Average Calculus Text, but not the best by far","This year my school switched Calculus textbooks and used my class as the guinea pigs to test out this book. I did not care for it as much as the brand we had used in the past. My main complaint is about the explanations and example problems. I felt the explanations were frequently incomplete and after reading them over many times, it was still confusing as to how they got from point A to point B. I did not feel the sample problems were representative of the type of problems asked in the exercises for each section. On the otherhand, the problems were very wide-ranging which is nice considering many math textbooks just have the same problem over and over again but with different numbers. If you don't depend on the explanations too much and just need the book for the homework problems, this shouldn't be bad. And even if you do need the explanations and sample problems to help you, I did and I still maintained an A average in the course."
1,Hope your teacher knows the subject,"I've had to suffer through three semesters so far using this book exclusively. Little hint, take VERY good notes in class because with this book you're going to need them. The way it explains subjects in calculus (especially anything dealing with series)is terribly confusing to the average student (aka me). Oh and one last thing, don't believe the back of the book, it lies, constantly."
5,Count On This Book For Help,"I had this text for all three semesters of calculus. I could always count on it for good explanations. The Internet site that accompanies the text is also really great. It has all the worked out solutions to the odd-numbered exercises in the text. These really helped me because I tend to be a late night worker and when I needed help I had only the book or the website to go to. Between the two of them, I always got my questions answered. If you are a student who likes immediate help late at night, this book is for you."
3,Interesting ;'-),"Ok, Not one for Bluegrass Music. But I thought I would give this a listen considering I am HUGE Def Leppard fan. I actually like this CD. I am not exactly sure why????? But I do. At least give the tracks a listen and then decide for yourself. You might find you like it. Although there will be no square dancing (lol)!!!!!!"
3,Just a thicker and stronger wire,Replaced my existing HTIB S9100thx 22ga wire with this. This thickness should be good enough for all the speakers no matter how far they are from the receivers.
1,Broke after one use,Got this for a family memebr for Christmas. Was used once and the speaker gave out. The speaker was weak to begin with and then started to rattle with any songs that had bass. Bad quality machine.
5,Rough boys,"Certainly a lot to read into these lyrics in light of events of the last two years. Great CD, though. ""Secondhand Love"" is a dreamscape."
4,Classic Looney Toons movie!,"I grew up watching this movie and is one I wanted for my 2 yr old daughter. It's classic Bugs, Tweety, Daffy, Sylvester, etc., and she's a HUGE tweety fan. She likes the movie OK and asks to watch it from time to time, but in the age of Computer Graphics, it doesn't have the visual appeal to her. I'm disappointed they haven't released this in DVD format so I was stuck buying a VHS tape, but you can't find it for rent anywhere either, so it was VHS or nothing. You can't beat a classic...we bought the VHS. I'm glad we did, but expect to see a movie that looks like it was made in the 70's or 80's, because it was."
5,True training!,"I wanted to learn to play this game for a while but could not find a really good explanation of what the tiles were and how to start a game. This DVD is great for training a real novice like myself. Keep in mind it is narrated by a young guy so his comments tend to be teen movie-ish. Still, he does a great job. The video starts with an explanation of the tiles, what points they are worth, and how to set up the table. He then begins a game and explains the moves and points earned. Scoring can be confusing so a cheat sheet is included in the DVD sleeve. This training video was well thought out and put together. Highly recommended for anyone who would like to learn the game."
3,Lindsay Check Cuddlewrap-Picture versus Reality,"The garment is warm and toasty. However, I was disappointed with the pattern of material it was made of. The picture that was displayed was not what I received. The picture was of a beautiful snowflake print in baby blue. That is what I thought I was getting. In fact, before I placed the actual order I went back to the site 3 different times to be sure. I thought that Lindsay Check was the brand, not the material. There was only one selection, next to the picture I wanted. But when I received it, it was of big buffalo checks in dark muted ugly colors I did not like. Look at the picture below this and that is what I wanted, but not what I got. That disappointed me, but I kept it because return shipping would have driven up the cost and then I would have had to reorder it from another vendor. That is why I rated it a 3-incorrect information given."
2,"Wonderful acting, but relatively empty otherwise.","It's been said many times already, but another 2 cents' worth: wonderful acting, mediocre story. The casting and acting are both flawless, and the chemistry between the two talented leads is wonderful, but I still found watching it to be somewhat empty and depressing. The film is, in essence, a couple of hours spent with a dysfunctional family, and there's not nearly enough insight or redemption on the whole to make it a worthwhile visit."
3,JUST PLAIN OL' GOOD MOVIE,"I like this movie a lot. However, I just don't get the point of the Mothers character. Yeah, she's a free-spirit with quirky tendencies, but they never really get to any point with why she acts like that, or if anything exciting will happen to her. For a moment I thought she was suffering depression in the scene where she just decides to vacuum rather than join her daughter (Portman) to a Christmas party. Besides that its a good movie. Lots of different scenes, which I like in all movies. Natalie Portman is a terrific actress and I will continue to collect all her great films like Beautiful Girls and Where The Heart Is."
2,"Disappointing, go elsewhere.","Don't buy this to have a portman movie. She is bound to be better in the future... unless you have junior high aged girls. My one daughter liked this movie, but when I asked her if she wanted it for a gift, she said no. So if my wife and daughter didn't like that much, i have to rate it as FAIR 2 stars."
5,"Great Fun, Great learning tool!","Well some have criticized this bag of pinata filler, but they don't understand how it is to be used. It's a learning tool! Kids need to learn that candy is great BUT it has its downsides. Some kids are too young to understand long term problems like diabetes or tooth decay, so the instant lessons like the pain of losing an eye or a sharp poke to the kidney really helps them learn there are consequences to eating candy. Also keeps lighter candies from flying away in the wind! I highly recommend this bag of pinata filler! 5 stars!!!"
4,Nice tool!,"After doing about 80 pop rivets manually, my wrists felt like they were going to explode! This gun is a life saver. Just a couple of pulls of your finger and your rivet in in! I've done only about a dozen rivets with this gun so far, and I'm thankful I bought it. This is my very first pneumatic tool, so I had no Idea about its maintenance. The owners manual states it needs to be lubed before use. So, I had to go to Lowes for oil before I can start using it. Little things like that would have been nice to know so I could have bought the oil BEFORE the item arrived."
2,Does not work with Outward (away from you) opening Doors,"I bought this latch to prevent my toddler from opening the door that goes out into the garage. This latch is not designed to work with Outward (away from you) opening Doors. The company should correctly state this in their description (-2 stars). If you want a latch to lock a door that opens when you pull it toward you, this is what it was designed for. Furthermore, the slide is not solid like it appears, it only has its edges beveled with a hollow back (-1 star)."
4,hot lusty sex but,the story is this kyra summers is a tax accountant on retreat in the woods with her best friend geris who is black and referred to as the onyx one since they have no blacks on thier planet anyhow tryston the arrogant king kidnaps her and marries her while she is unconcious she finds out she is to be an empress sounds great right well not exactly first of all women are treated like objects little more than slaves second they have to be naked at all times but when they wear see through jump suits plus at consummation feasts for newlyweds little more than orgies that was all great the hedonism was spectactular but I could'nt get past the sexism it was surprising a woman wrote this if you like sex this is the novel for you also her missing sister is reffered to but is not in the novel highest reccomendation with a warning sexism is not resolved btw geris is kidnapped too and married
3,Unsuspecting,"The book was okay. I was expecting more monogamy among the main characters--especially after getting married or mated. The extra tongue, teeth, lips, etc. the main characters received from the other characters in the book was distracting and to me took away from the romance of the ""romantica"". Oh well call me Old Fashioned."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"A bounding pace by itself does not a story make. I found the pace more jittery than bounding, actually. This kind of story doesn't call for intricate layers, but some justice could be done to characters even so. Without it there's not enough plot to make sex scenes effective enough to be worth reading from scene to scene. Nor did skipping to the 'good parts' keep me awake, since they are all alike. Above all, why pay the price of two good books to get this?"
4,Can't judge a book by its cover...,I love this book... This is my first Jaid Black book. It was awesome! I loved it. could not put it down!
4,1st Jaid Black book I've read,Wanted to try a different genre than what normally read and found that I couldn't put it down. I will have to continue reading this series.
5,Very Pleased,"While in France this year, we were drinking this brand of coffee every day for two weeks and very happy to have found that it was available here. It's a great coffee, bold, rich, great aroma and very French. The shipment came in perfect order and faster than quoted. Over all, very please with vendor and of course, love the coffee. Recommend it to all coffee drinkers."
4,"""Heart"" bubblebath","I really like these products but just too much for my pockeet book. The bubbles are pretty good and the smell is nice. Most products in stores are loaded with chemicals and fragrances that are way too strong and synthetic. I feel better bathing my children in ""heart"" bubble bath (as my toddler calls it). No problems with the shipping of this product."
4,Execellant,Great story of ambition and the clash of classes. The aerial photography and air battle scenes were highly realistic. Excellent period piece giving context to social conflicts during the Great War.
4,good airwar movie,"I thought the cast did a fine job and tne underrated George prepard carried off his role quite well. The story of a man obsessed with getting a blue max award is a good one, he's ruthless and heartless and it stands up welleven today. You have great supporting actors like James Mason and Ursulla Andress to round out the storyline and that's fine. There's plenty of action and although this isn't the best flick about the airwar it's pretty good and engaging. This one needs the blu ray treatment someday but the dvd looks at least decent here."
5,"""Flying by the seat of your pants""","There are not too many good movies about the WW1 aviators but this is one. It gives an insight into how the war was won and lost in the air with good arial scenes. This is great if you want toimagine what early flying was like, no real instruments to help you navigate and with very basic controls these aviators were really flying by the seat of their pants. You should enjoy this one, I know I did."
4,Worth buying just for the aerial photography alone.,This 1960's movie based on Jack Hunter's novel is perhaps the best live action aerial photography ever done. I know the details have been picked apart by military historians but it does an excellent job portraying the class struggle of the era.With today's computer generated and scale model aircraft an action movie like this will never be filmed again. Nowadays no stunt flier would ever take the risk that pilot Derek Pigot took to film some of the scenes.Kurt Koivu
5,The Long Wait is Over,"Fans of Steve McQueen's classic racing movie ""Le Mans"" have been waiting patiently for decades to get their hands on a recording of Michel Legrand's wonderful score. McQueen's obsession with racing footage over plot would probably have fallen flat without Legrand's jazz-tinged orchestrations. This disc finally delivers. In addition there are tracks that didn't make the film (including a wild Jean-Luc Ponty jam) and more tracks from McQueen's later film ""The Hunter."" I almost bought it on vinyl back in '81 at a used record store in Covent Garden but passed on the opportunity because it was expensive and I didn't want to carry the record all over Europe. Now, 37 years after I first saw the film as a teenager, the disc is in my own Porsche 911 ready for a drive in the country -- although at a bit less than 200 mph."
5,Excellent,"What made me like this movie was the acting, the actors were so good at playing there roles. The writers didn't to bad either the screenplay was very original, and the ending ........... is excellent it deserves 10 stars."
2,Not orginal,"Sorry, I didn't enjoy this movie. It was too laden with cliches.You can't watch this movie and say you haven't seen it before in another, better movie."
1,The Single Worst Movie Ever Made,"Watching this movie was one of the least pleasant experiences in my life. The plot and dialogue were so cliche-ridden and horribly presented that it was, at times, laughable. There were at least 5 or 6 times during the course of this drivel that I thought to myself ""Wow - that was the single worst line of dialogue I have ever heard in my life."" The plot has been done over so many times, and is so predictable and utterly insulting to the viewer that I will not waste my energy attempting to describe it here. Before seeing this movie I thought that Chris Klein and Lelee Sobieski had some talent as actors. I was proven wrong. This movie is not only insulting to you as a viewer, it is insulting to you as a human being. Do not, I repeat DO NOT, under any circumstances, ever see this movie. Please, heed my words and avoid this mindless drivel at all costs."
1,Awful..,"This movie is awful, I cannot stand LeeLee Sobieski as an actress, she makes me feel like I am going to be sick.. She always delivers her lines so forced.. Like you can tell she is reading, she just is very annoying and gets under my skin BAD, and therefore watching her only makes it worse. I am sure she is a great person or whatever, but she does not need to be an actress. Chris Klein was also VERY disappointing in this movie, Josh Hartnett was pretty good though. I definately do not recommend this.. but hey every man to his own, maybe you will like it."
1,Why?,"This movie is awful.The movie took some of the most talented young actors in Hollywood and wasted their talents in this dreadful teen romance.The movie is about a private school prep that crashes into a diner and has to spend his summer re-building it.While he is re-building this diner he falls for LeeLee Sobieski,who is dating Josh Hartnet.Yeah rich prep and poor sick smalltown girl fall for each other and she dumps Josh(why?why?)for this rich prep.Oh and she is dying as well.This movie is horrid.Chris Klien,LeeLee Sobieski,and Josh Hartnet wasted their talent for this awful movie.The movie is so predictable it's just not even funny.Don't even waste your time.If you want a good drama get A Walk To Remember."
3,Cute,It is a cute movie if you like a cute little romance story. It definitely couldnt win an Oscar but it is a fun watch.
3,It wasn't all that bad,"I know a lot of people are disappointed with the ending and how things go during the love triangle. But I feel that it shows if you really love someone, you have to let them go. A person cannot always control the way their heart feels and that is out leelee's character. She loves both men, but her heart is pulling her in a direction she has never been before."
2,Only the ending music saves this one,"If it were not for ""Where You Are,"" the love song from the film sung by Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, this movie would be a complete waste of precious time. So predictable, so done before a million times, corny as a cartoon, with completely predictable story lines. How many times do we have to watch a rich, spoiled kid (Chris Klein) steal the girl (Leelee) away from the true Knight in Shining Armor (Josh Harnett). Perfect example is A WALK TO REMEMBER with Mandy Moore as the terminally ill babe who falls for the no-no bad guy. Same story here, just different actors... And anyone remember Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink, or for that matter, any other Molly Ringwald movie back in the early 1980s?? At least Molly was quirky and a fun actress to watch. It's all been done before, except this time the actors are very unlikeable, their performances unmemorable. The only 2 stars I give this film are for the pretty song, otherwise this is a big dud."
3,"'Here On Earth' is disappointing, yet pleasing","Here on Earth starts out great, it is slow, but an easy catch-on. It all starts out when Sobieski is best friends with Harnett, although Harnett is in love with her and has been, but she is clueless. Then, big city boy Klein comes into town and steals Sobieski's fancy. Harnett is getting jealous, but Klein says he doesn't have anything on him, but is soon falling in love, too. Sooner or later, love unwinds and Harnett confesses. But you would think that Sobieski would go for the old, well-known Harnett, but she chooses the new, Klein, and goes to Boston, bringing Sobieski and Harnett friends again. Then they have to make the ending disappointing. Sobieski dies of an infected cut on her knee, which leads tragedy to the rolling credits. But the movie wasn't as bad as many thought. With the dvd having deleted scenes, a behind-the-scenes featurette, and an audio commentary, this dvd will bring more likeness to your small screen."
3,Not my cup of tea,"This was an okay movie... but I don't recommend rushing out to rent it tonight unless you're in the mood to be depressed. Why do so many movies have to take a happy note and turn it sour? As my boyfriend said, don't rent any movie with the word ""earth"" in it because it's going to make you cry."
4,A Sweet Movie,"Rich kid Kelley (Chris Klein) was given a hot sports car for his graduation present by the father who could not arrange to be there even though Kelley was valedictorian. However, Kelley got into the inevitable argument with a local kid, Jasper (Josh Hartnett), who has been dating Samantha (Leelee Sobieski). Kelley and Jasper get into a hot rod race that results in the fire that destroyed a popular local cafe. Problem: the cafe was run by the sheriff's sister, who is also Samantha's mother.The judge sentences Kelley and Jasper to work on the rebuilding of the cafe, and Samantha is kind to Kelley. You can probably write the romance part from there.But there's something about Samantha's knee . . . no, I'm not going to tell you what. It's a sweet movie, and does not deserve to be spoiled."
5,Best Ringo Book ever,"Dave Johnson has included more facts about John Ringo than any author before him.This,as of now,is the definitive book on the Desparado from Texas and Arizona.The chapters on Ringo in Texas are worth the price of the book alone.Those of us who are interested in the other side of the Tombstone story appreciate Johnson's fact finding.This is first rate.....John Presutti"
3,No Doug Sahm on this CD! Take Care!,"According to products description, ""Here I Go Again"" features duet with the late great Doug Sahm.However, actually it shows only ""Live Acoustic Duet"", and I am unable to recognized Doug Sahm's performance on it.Please take care of this, if you are fond of Tex-Mex rocker Doug Sahm.In addition, Bernie Marsden's rendition of Peter Green's songs is not so bad, for your reference."
2,Not Too Bad,"I gave this to my son for Christmas. Within 2 weeks, the microphone stopped working. Everything else seems to work just fine,but the main reason for buying it was the microphone because my son loves to sing."
4,Good Quality Wine Cabinet,"Good price, nice quality, easy to assemble. I purchased two to sit side by side, thinking about purchasing another. Can't beat the price."
5,My Dad needed this item and I didn't know it.,My Father only has five teeth and won't get dentures. The food chopper has made possible to give him his favorite food; chopped and smooth. His blood sugar has gone down as well as his sodium level.
1,Pale Faced Book Written With Christian Viewpoint,Definately not a book for serious travelers of Chanka Luta.
5,Worth It,"This product is very good for parties that you are going to have Karaoke at!!!! It is very powerful!!!! It is also useful instead of carrying a cord around!!!! This would be great for anyone who likes to sing on a karaoke machine!!! It works on all karaoke machines and it does look a lot different but it is still good looking!!!! Thank you Target for carrying it at such a low, low, low cost!!! It would have cost me a whole lot more $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$!!!!!!!!"
2,Do not use unless you have a Line IN input,"This microphone in theory, is a good deal. However, like most people, I have a karaoke player with only microphone inputs and this microphone performed poorly (fuzzy). And I am not about to go out and buy a new karaoke machine just for this wireless microphone, so it only gets 2 stars from me. The cords are not very long either, so you can't move the receiver very far from the karaoke machine either.Too bad, affordable wireless microphones are hard to find (outside of the low-quality ones offered on ebay). If most karaoke players had line inputs, I would give this particular mic 4 out of 5 stars."
2,You get what you pay for!,This mic is ok for little kids. But it is very fuzzy. I gave it many chances now I'm returning it.
4,I absolutely love it!,"I love this wireless microphone, but if you go too far away from the reciever, the microphone will turn off. Other than that, there are really no other problems I have had with it. I love being able to take the microphone anywhere without the cords tripping and tangling around me. I hope I helped you make your decision! This microphone set is great; I want to get another one!"
1,1 star too many,"this movie stinks. im doing it a real favour by giving it one star.there is nothing good i think to say.If these actors werent stars they would never make another movie after this, as it is its one of those star movies where they obviously enjoy winking to camera and putting on wigs, but they should keep these home videos to themselves."
4,Sharing profits & love,"Given that the film had a rather eccentric bunch of characters (afterall, they were supposed to be outlaws) & the said characters had a rather eccentric relationship with each other, the movie had its own moments. Terry's imposed medical condition, Joe's irresistible charm & Kate's indecisiveness (...there is no perfect man or Mr. Right!!!)had its own allure to the viewers.It's not a good idea to ponder though that robbery is justified in this film & that the criminals get away with it. Much worse, is, what they do after their big get away!A good entertainment film...."
