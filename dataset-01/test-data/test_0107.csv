1,Inaccurate and battery life,After a year and a half I give up on this rain gauge. It only registers 2/3 of rain when side by side with regular tube gauge. I have calibrated it to Lacrosse instructions to no avail. Battery life is about 60 days in cold weather and is difficult to replace batteries and reinstall and battery cover will break very easy due to faulty design.
2,Not the Best Cook novel,"I am a big fan of Glen Cook's stories and I had known about this book for years, but couldn't find it. I have ready every book of Mr. Cook's, and enjoyed most (no, not all though), but this one was bad. Simplistic characters with no depth and predictable story. I could only assume that this is the first story he ever wrote... and it shows. If you enjoy the Black Company series and the Dread Empire stories then stay away from this book. If you are a fan and just have to have this book to complete your collection, I have a copy that I will sell you"
4,This is an exallent book on The Thirty Years War.,"This book is an exallent book on The Thirty Years War. It begins its narative in 1608 to show some of the background of the War. The Thirty Years War was an very complex war; Mr. Parker tries to examine the War from all of the sides invovled. He doesn't take any side. The two drawbacks of the book are that it is written by a number of different authors and is a bit choppy because of this. The other drawback is that it is quite terse. Each major incedent is described in in a brief and acurate way. In order to understand the book, one has to either read it very carefully or read the book a number of times. While the main focus of the book is the political incedents, there is an appendix which discusses the major military changes that occured in the War."
2,Definitely Not for the Casual Reading,"A previous reviewer said this is not for the casual reader. My rating is not reflective of the book itself but of my preference for what I look for in a history book. Reading the Dutch Reformation with particular interest in James Arminius, I thought the Thirty Years War might interest me. Yet, although I was intrigued by how it demonstrates the complexities of this war - or any war - it confused me with its intricate information and details. Chapter 6, part on the 'Universal Soldier', was quite intriging for me. However, this book is for those seriously interested in this partciular subject. Truthfully, it is not for the casual reader."
3,A good read ... but overrated,"I was really excited about reading this book after learning about Abbie Hoffman in ""Steal This Movie."" Overall, though, it was a bit of a letdown.As an insight into the thinking of the Yippies and the entire thoughtprocess behind the countercultural movement of the '60s, ""Steal This Book"" does a good job.However, it purports to be a manual on how to live life for free, and many things in the book are not free and couldn't be free, and are actually outside of the realm for most people to pull off. Also, it is, obviously, horribly outdated.So take it for what it is. It's cool reading Hoffman's rants about the system and what not, but overall the book comes up short on actual substance.Peace."
3,Quite nice,"At times I wanted to scream at the book, because I was so frustrated with how little romance is actually in it. Until the very end all that is shared between the main caracters are a few stolen kisses. This book is frustratingly full of details about native american life, when what you really want to read about is the blossoming love between War Eagle and Caroline. The historylesson is interesting, but not what I bargained for when purchasing this book. On the positive side the book is actually wellwritten, well paced and full of beliavable secondary characters. What I do miss is a deeper insight into the mindsets of the main characters. Especially War Eagle has you guessing most of the time, which is a real shame.Overall a nice read, if you are truly interested in the old ways of the native americans and do not mind that the romantic scenes are few and far apart, quite naively written and no hot details are revealed at all."
1,Mistake,"When I saw this book was for free I thought, sure let's give it a try. No. I do not recommend you buy this book, too much history and not enough with the characters. Boring and long. Don't waste your money or time."
2,Dragged on and on and on,"I love stories about Native Americans and mostly Janelle Taylor's books. But, this one, I would call it boring. Sorry Ms. Taylor about this review. Your repetitive writing put me to sleep. Were you trying to convince the reader that the characters were truly in love? Can someone choose to write about Native American love stories like Native with Native not a white captive or WHATEVER. Come on, convince me that love exists in their culture. It is only civilized. As, we, Whites refer to the Native Americans as ""Savages"" and, of course, they were the CIVILIZED culture who committed atrocious crimes in the name of greed and religion, but this was okay and still is considered okay because color is enough to make us better than all cultures. Prove your readers wrong? It makes me so upset that our history books deny this fact. Hatred could have been prevented. Thank you"
2,"Very Cute, but sole fell off in 2 wks","I love the way my shoes look and fit. However, the right sole came unglued within 2 weeks. I was very disappointed because they are unwearable. I usually have good luck with Roos, and maybe I got a bad pair, but don't say you weren't warned!"
4,Classic treatise on man's urge to create,"Breaking man's urge to create down to the point of a dialectic battle between his level of comfort with the surrounding environment, Worringer outlines the historical balance between our urge to make what we perceive concrete (through abstraction) or organic (through empathy). This classic dissertation argues it is only by finding a state of equipoise between these two urges that art can make a lasting connection with any generation.Recommended for all those interested in advancing art and design evaluation beyond mere opinion."
3,Works OK but useless instructions.,This does what I expected but only after an hour searching for instructions on the internet (found nothing useful) and another hour of trying every possible wiring combination to try to stumble on the correct one. I finally did.No useful instructions are included. The included wiring diagrams (about 1/4 of a normal page) are so small that you must use a magnifying glass. The included wiring diagrams make no sense relative to any normal 12 volt wiring. They have a wire labeled as Red +12 VDC Ground and a Black - Ground. I sent an email to a supplier of these who wrote back that I should contact the manufacturer. Good luck with that.Only three stars --- another 1/4 page of instructions would have helped.
5,Great for Deck Steps,"My aging dog was having trouble getting up the deck steps because her feet would slide. I put two strips of this tape on each step, and it gives her just enough traction to get secure footing. As an added benefit, I feel more secure, especially when the steps are wet. Great stuff!"
2,"Album is ""burned"" CD-ROM without liner notes","If you purchase this item ""new"" from Amazon, look carefully to see if it's listed as ""manufactured on demand using CD-R recordable media."" The CD itself will be a greenish ""burned"" CD-ROM, not a standard factory-made CD. The burned CD-ROM bears only a generic ""Naxos"" label on it without any identifying album name! And worst of all, there are NO liner notes - none of the excellent scholarly Naxos liner notes that I have come to expect when purchasing their other classical albums. Caveat emptor!"
3,Worth the download,"If you are a fan of Kaysha you will enjoy this c.d. Elizio's tracks consist of Zouk, R&B, and Funana... and the blend works. I enjoyed 5 of the songs of the C.D. so I would recommend the c.d to others. The best tracks are the ones that feature other artists."
5,This is about Christmas at hospitals,"This book is cool. Horrible Harry is horrible because he does horrible things like putting frogs in girls' hair. Horrible likes horrible creatures, too. He gives his teacher a rocking chair with spiders on it. You should buy this book because it is a very interesting book."
5,The D&C is a true Jem. That is the only book of it kind,"In the rating system they have for us to rate. I would have rated it off the charts. This book is truly inspired of God. It oulines the fundemental doctrines and principles of the Plan of Salvation. It answers questions such as these ( Who we are?, Where we came from?, What is the purpose of this life?, and What happens after we die?) . It also outlines many fundemental Doctrines as that of faith, repentance, Baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, the Atonement of Jesus Christ, THe Preisthood ( Aaronic and Melchizedec preisthoods) , Eternal Marriage, the true nature of GOd, and many more things that are innumerable to list here. I know this book is true. ANd even if you are not a member of the LDS church if you read this book you can gain a better understanding of why we beleive the way we do. This is absolutely a wonderful book that anyone will recognize as truth is they are honest with themselves and are truly seeking truth.."
1,"Two copies, neither worked",I purchased one copy and it didn't work so I returned it and got another. The second copy didn't work either. Both played for about 7 minutes and then played a black screen.
3,"I am a diehard fan of Doris Day, but...","I am a huge fan of Doris Day and enjoy even her silliest movies. But these TV specials were too hokey even for me. The ""extras"" on the DVD were more interesting than the actual Christmas specials."
1,Did Not Work!,These did not work in my Canon MP830 printer. The tanks require tiny chips be removed from the old tanks and clipped into the new tanks. I am an electronics engineer and work with chips but this was not an easy task. After installing the chips in two tanks the printer would not recognize the tanks and gave an error message. All I got after a hour of frustration was ink stains on my hands.
5,Classic Doulton,"My kids love these and I love the vintage feel. The pictures are just lovely, with camping and rowing scenes. Beware, if dropped on tiles, it breaks. ;-(("
5,Totally pleased,The Bunnykins dish set is beautiful and top quality. We can't wait to see our grandaughters reaction to it.
2,"Very sweet, but broken","I got this Roayl Doulton gift set at a very good price, but unfortunately when it arrive in the Seychelles Islands - the plate was broken and I can not use the set as a gift anymore - pitty! Very sweet set."
2,Arrived Broken,I can't actually review the product as it arrived in pieces. It was returned and my money was refunded. I did not attempt to have it replaced.
4,Nice film of the series,"Having enjoyed the books back when I was little, I was excited when this movie came out. It's impossible to fit the whole series into one film, but I think that a nice job was done. The girls chosen for their characters filled their roles nicely, and I enjoyed this film. While everyone has their issues to deal with, one big thing was Kristy and her dad, and the bittersweet that came with it."
1,BORING,AS MUCH AS I LIKE THE BOOKS I HATED THIS MOVIE.IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THE BOOKS.THEY COULD'VE DONE A BETTER JOB.IT DRAGGED WAY TOO MUCH.THERE WAS NO EXCITEMENT.BOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
4,Twisted easy listening,"I bought the LP for twenty cents among 75 other albums and probably liked it most. As a listener of techno and ambient music, it is nice to hear musics that bridge the electronic with the organic. This drives my usually docile cockatiel into a chirping frenzy; it is certainly his favorite album. The guy who dissed ""The Cricket"" can answer to the bird."
3,Couldn't get into it for a long time,"Unlike one reviewer, I did feel bogged down too often in this story - at least in the first third of it. I kept putting the book aside to read others. Finally, I was determined to finish the book (I did buy it, after all) so I began it all over again, and was glad I persevered. Once I got past the plodding parts, the story just took off for me.This story strongly shows you the difficulty women had in being taken seriously in the business world, and I commend Ms. Thomas for addressing this so well. When Ryan gave Rachel a set of engineering tools (his own set yet!), I took it as his acknowledgement of her skills and his acceptance of the idea that she had stepped outside the traditional role of women."
2,"Good Idea, poor quality","Pros:1. Usually accurate2. Tracking software works wellCons:1. Poor quality2. Pressure button gives different results based on where your thumb is positioned3. Unit freezes occasionally4. Much too expensive for what you getThis little machine would be worth the money if the company would have put a little more effort into quality. The unit feels cheaply made. Mine is a week old and already a button is broken. The unit also freezes occasionally and also sometimes gives crazy readings for no reason. However, the tracking software works as advertised and is useful.Save your money and frustration and buy a caliper from a different company and use that with the tracking software that is downloadable from the company website. This product is not worth $70; $15-$20 would be more appropriate."
3,Works ok.. Is it worth the price?,"The display graphics look like it came from a 1970's handheld video game and makes it difficult to read for some people.The overall quality was ok, made of plastic and feels very lightweight/delicate like it could easily break. Personally don't think it's worth the price it's being sold for, a price of $20-$30 would be more reasonable in my opinion.Overall the item appeared to work ok (as it should), just didn't care for the hard to read display graphics and think the price could be more realistic to what you actually get (quality). The case and software is a pleasant added bonus, still doesn't raise the value to the retail price it's being sold at."
5,Oh yes I love My Import!,"I bought this at Mod Lang in Berkeley in the mid 90s and DAMN! I did not stop playing this for two years. Great early and rare stuff. Nice to see how he grew as a songwriter and how his demos come about. Loads of sexy and partying, stay up all night going mad on charlie tunes. Great disc. In my top five Nick Lowe cds."
5,Works great to easily suspend and position the fenders,These boat fender hangers do exactly what they're supposed to do: provide an easy way to suspend and position the fenders over the side of our sailboat. They're a little pricey (but then again everything related to boating is pricey) but they are easy to use and seem to work great. We're happy with them so far.
2,sizing inaccurate,"I ordered this hat in the range that included 7 1/2,but it was way too big and I ended up returning it."
3,It's OK at best...,"The display is not very bright. It takes an effort to see what exactly is on display awaiting print. However the amount of tape this unit wastes is spectacular. Especially if you creating labels that have short phrases or single words, the amount of tape that leads to either side may double and in some instances triple the area of what was actually printed. This will ensure you will go through the 26 ft tape spool faster than goose poop shooting through a tin horn. Another downer is that it uses 6 AA batteries but it did not include a power supply (even though it is equipped to use one).On the positive side, the PT-1880 is easy to use, the tape spool was easy to install (it better be, you'll be changing it often enough) and the printing is clear and crisp. I would just suggest you do your homework with other units (including this one) and then make the most informed choice possible. The 1880 worked, but it definetly had its drawbacks."
2,Brother Labeler sold be Tech and Office,Don't know if the labeler is good or not as it arrived and did not work. Tech and Office should wrap products in bubble wrap or somekind of cushion - this labeler was just thrown in a box and shipped UPS. Any company that has been around for 1 or 2 hours knows howboxes are handled by UPS.This company needs to hire someone who cares about their job and would package items the way that person would like to recieve theirs.
1,Brother Not What They Used to Be,"My old Brother typewriter was great, but for this labeler the ribbon malfunctioned right out of the box and Brother would not send me a replacement. I was very disheartened to find they would not back their product."
2,Just OK,I have older P-Touch machines at work so I'm familiar with their products. I don't like this because of the manual cutter and also the unit I received had a dim LCD display. Another issue was that I couldn't get my 6 volt power adapter to work well on the machine. It would power all of the functions except for the printing. This unit required a 6-8 volt input (couldn't find the current spec) and buying the recommended P-touch power adapter makes the overall price of the unit too expensive.
5,USER FRIENDLY CREATIVE LABEL MAKER,"I LOVE THIS LABEL MAKER WITH IT'S VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS IN VARIOUS FONTS, FONT SIZES, AND THE VARIETY OF BORDERS FOR SCRAPBOOKING. VERY USER FRIENDLY!PLUS, MORE VARIETY IN THE LABEL CARTRIDGES IN SIZES AND COLORS!I HAD PURCHASED THE P-TOUCH MODEL PT-80, IT WAS NOT USER FRIENDLY AND HAD WAY LESS OPTIONS. ON SALE THIS ONE ONLY COST $10.00 MORE THAN THE PT-80, PAID $29.99 AT OFFICE DEPOT.I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN, IN FACT I PURCHASED ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAWS MOM FOR CHRISTMAS 2009, SHE IS AN AVID SCRAPBOOKER.ENJOY YOUR CREATIVITY!"
1,Serious Tape Waster,"This product wastes as much tape as it uses to print each label. This is no exaggeration, this thing wastes like crazy. It's almost funny that someone would design a product like this; apparently Brother wants to get rich on tape sales - at our expense. I won't be buying any other Brother products after this experience."
4,A Great Choice,"War and Remembrance is a terrific mini series. If you love movies about World War II, you will find this one a true gift. I recommend that you also purchase Winds of War and watch it first. I have read both books by Herman Wouk and find these movies to be excellent adaptations. It would also be a great choice for those hard to buy for members of your family."
4,Good miniseries.,"Loved the show when it was on TV years ago. Was very pleased to be able to find it on DVD. These discs have good quality, and am grateful they have been Closed Captioned. They may seem poorer quality than modern day high def DVD, but for their time, they are very acceptable."
2,War and remembrance not very memorable,"A very disappointing sequel to Winds of war, for two main reasons: The script was written by two writers other than Herman Wouk, who 'co-wrote'; and the director was completely out of his depth, allowing the actors who played Hitler, Stalin, Eichmann, and several others to disintegrate into cartoon characters. The change of cast is also distracting for those who saw Winds. The film cannot make up its mind whether it wants to be a docudrama about WWII, the search for Nathalie and her son, or the soap opera between Rhoda and Pug. There are several more subplots as well, so the mind starts to wander rather quickly. There are far too many unnecessaery scenes of violence and graphic suffering. As a specialist in military history and uniforms, I was driven around the bend by the inaccuracies in American uniforms, insignia, and decorations. May be worth watching once to find out what happened after Winds, but all in all, a very expensive letdown."
3,A little too much,"This is quite a bit longer than Winds of War and it may not need to be. I skip over parts that deal with the trials and tribulations of people who, in Winds of War wandered around Europe not heeding good advice to get out while they could. Here, again, they are places where they should not be. I originally taped Winds of War and then made an edited copy I called ""The Pug Henry Story"". I have not done that with the DVD or with War and Remembrance, though I sense such an edit would be very desirable. In the meantime, get ready to fast forward or skip chapters to bring this down to a reasonable length."
1,The Title Says It All,"I did not read this book cover to cover, because the etiquette described in the chapters I did review, including ""Communication"", ""Weddings"", ""Giving and Receiving Gifts"", and ""Office Etiquette"" was either obvious (fake enjoyment if you receive an uninspired gift, be on time for a job interview...) or unhelpfully broad. This book may be appropriate for a teen whose manners need polishing. But as an [I hope] already somewhat considerate adult, I picked up no new information or strategies from this book."
5,A Baffling Mystery,"Review of Voice From the Ashes by Cindy DavisWith Mt. Saint Helens as a perfect backdrop, Cindy Davis has created a perfectly baffling mystery. In a small town populated with a slew of possible suspects, we see red herrings everywhere through Police Chief Ian Merryweather's ""new eyes."" While the volcano puffs out threats to the natural world, a murderer secretly delivers threatening notes and then acts on them. Mrs. Davis pulls no punches as she brackets her novel with two gruesome deaths. But it isn't all grim. There is a touching love story running parallel to the main plot."
2,not thrilled,"I bought these two years ago and they just died on me. I went right back to Bose speakers which are the same price and, although not usb powered, sounded so much better. - these were only marginally better than the speakers in my Macbook - I also hated the slim design - they kept falling over."
4,"Looks great, sounds terrible!","Appearance: Looks great on the wall, fits perfectly with my arts & crafts decor. As others have mentioned, the rubbed bronze tubes on the side are actually plastic wrapped. This doesn't bother me, as the unit is approximately 8-9ft off the floor.Sound: Terrible. No seriously, this thing is comical to listen to. My wife and I laugh every time somebody rings the door bell. It has a very distinct ""donk"" sound. The plus side is that you won't mistake the door bell for any other possible sound!Install: Extremely straightforward. Replaced an older unit, and had to upgrade the transformer to 16v. Took about 30 minutes total.Overall: 4 stars, looks great, easy to install, sounds terrible, but gets the job done."
4,Evolution of a great band!!!!,"I speak again, of giving a real if not honest, review of music, unlike others, who just explain why something does not bode well for their own tastes!!! This album represents the Starship very well for the time. It was the 80's for crying out loud!!! All the seeds, once again are there, even without Paul Kantner in the band. Craig Chaquico's playing really shines on songs like ""Tommorrow Doen't Matter Tonight"", ""Rock Myself to Sleep"" and ""Desperate Heart"". The vocals, what can be said, that you can't tell, by just listening. Mickey Thomas and Grace's voices fit nicely together. Mickey is blamed for the Starship's commercial direction, which is just plain stupidity!!! Was ""miracles"", from Jefferson Starship's 1975 album, Red Octopus not commercial? Hardly! Besides, it was Paul's idea to get Mickey in the band in 1978, anyway. So he and other people should just realize, that the band was just in the process of evolution, like everything else is in the universe!!!"
2,Grace wasn't the oldest,"Louis Armstrong was 66 years and 10 months when he peaked with ""What A Wonderful World""/""Cabaret"" in Feb 1968.Oldest woman is Cher who was 52 years and 7 months when she hit the number 1 spot with ""Believe"" (1999).That said, I still don't like this record, and I like a lot of pop and new wave from that era. But if you like eighties pop-rock (like Survivor, yuck) then you might like this."
5,What a great album!,"I think Michael Giersher should stop listening to whatever crap he listens to (probably Mmmmbop) and get with the freaking program. We Built This City is one of the most popular and easily recognizable songs on the radio!There's no feeling better than playing Rock Myself to Sleep full blast and shouting along!Sarah is a great ballad that makes me sad everytime I hear it.Michael, why don't you stop trashing good music or I'll start trashing your idols (the three 6 year olds that make up Hanson)."
4,enlightening,Thank goodness not a diet book but an insight on why food plays such a powerful role in our lies.
5,Riveting cold war story,"I loved this book, read it over a weekend. I've never read James Carroll's fiction before, but I did enjoy American Requiem and Constantine's Sword. The same moral voice that he employs in those books is evident here. His characters, although flawed, are lovely and I thought about them for a long time after I'd finished the book. Parts of this book are hair raising, and anyone who likes John Le Carre or Graham Greene will like this fine novel. I will give this to many family members this Christmas- it is a good read for men and for women."
3,It could help some people,"What is your learning style? If you don't trust that you know something until you've taken a test, this book can help. It does an excellent job of pulling out the key topics and quizzing you on them. There are no 'silly' questions here--only the important stuff. On the other hand, if you like to read and underline, then return to the text when you are actually 'doing' the activity, then this book is probably a waste of money. One nit complaint: some of the labeling of chart features is a bit unclear. Since it is sometimes tough to tell which letter goes with which feature, answering some questions is difficult, even when you know the material."
4,This is Different,"It is refreshing to see a common sense approach to trading for the novice trader. The author takes you into the world of trading as a business where a rational plan and no emotion make the moves, not some ""gut feeling"" or the roulette wheel approach. He takes the gamble pretty much out of the equation. You are steered away from ""black box"" type trading programs that tell you automatically when to buy and sell. that alone will save your thousands of dollars on worthless ""guru"" programs. You are taken into the technical analysis world and all aspects of it. Financial planning is also a key.You also get a work book as a companion volume (extra cost) to put your new found knowledge into action.The best book on trading I have seen yet. The author is a Psychologist so that may have something to do with his common sense approach."
1,A Poor Book,I was totally disappointed with this book.Don't waste your money on this book or any others she has written. Amazon should not allow book authors to review their own book. That should be a tip off.
1,Not Worth the Money,Not worth the money. I haven't been able to find a size line that properly tucks inside the catch mechanism. Save your money and learn how to tie a proper knot for hanging you fenders.
4,Big man Big Laughs,"I have a horrible memory but the two movies i always remembered as a kid were goonies and big man on campus. I must have saw it over 10 years ago and decided to go look for the video. The movie cracked me up so bad i had to go buy it, i cant wait to show it to people for the first time."
4,Funny movie,Really wish I could get the DVD. Have it on laserdisc but no longer have a laserdisc player!
1,ARE THEY KIDDING?,As you can plainly see from the other reviewers they all think this is a terrible movie. They were being kind.
1,FIELD OF SCREAMS,"This third entry in the DARK HARVEST series is absolutely one of the worst movies to come around since PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE. This one's not even campy though. The scarecrow changes its hood numerous times throughout the movie, and the threadbare plot has so many holes, it's like swiss cheese. A total waste of time...don't bother."
1,What is it?,"It is so hard to find a cologne that works with your own body chemistry. I have been using this for years and was dissapointed when Aramis stopped producing it. I ordered a bottle directly from Amazon and not an individual seller, thinking that this would be safer. I received the bottle and noticed that the packaging was off. I have two bottles at home that I purchased from retailers a while back. They did not look the same. When I sprayed the contents it was totally awful. The cologne was not even close to the right scent. It was a total fake. I would not recommend buying this product. I guess that I just have to seek out a new cologne. I suggest the same for anyone else that uses Aramis Life.Aramis Life By Aramis For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces"
4,Nat's best,"This is my favorite Nat Adderley album. Compared to many of his other, especially later, releases, this CD is quite a standout. The album mixes tempos nicely, and tune selection is excellent. Only the slow ""Love Letters"" doesn't do much for me; all the other tunes are very good. Recommended."
4,Not bad,"This is definitely a screen saver, but unless you put a hard case over the phone the edges will peal, meaning you will have to buy more of them."
4,Longer than in the picture,"This screen protector is good, except that it goes all the way down and around the scroll wheel (it doesn't cover it up though).If you don't like it covering up that much, then a pair of scissors can easily fix it."
5,Great product and they have screen protectors for other phones,My friend from HK just got this phone and ask me to buy her an Eforcity screen protector. She loves it!!!
2,Waste of $,"If you're thinking of buying this CD because Sin-a-matic was so dope beware because this is nothing like Louis Logic's first proper album. From what I understand this wasn't meant to be groundbreaking music but more of a fun party album, but it still sucks. J-Love brings some real sh--ty rhymes on this album and the beats are pretty much subpar, aside from 1 or 2 tracks. The song with J-Zone and Celph Titled is okay but still doesn't save this waste of time and money. Maybe there's a reason there are 60 used copies for sale here on amazon, I always see a few in the used bin at my local record store too, thats where my copy went. I was REALLY dissapointed with this CD, but most of my friends thought it was alright, so maybe its just me, but I'm hoping Louie Lodge's next solo album isn't anything like this disaster of an album."
3,Engineer,"I was a bit disappointed when I first opened the book, I thought I was opening CorelDraw 10 for windows. Steve and Phyllis used many of the same illustrations found in their CorelDraw 10 book. Yes, I know the old illustrations get the point across, but,when I buy a new book I expect new illustrations and text to give me the sense I purchased a whole new book with all fresh and new information. Maybe a new illustration would shed light on a particular problem I was having, whereas,the old illustrations could not get the point across. All in all I'll will use the book in ernest, but when the going gets tough, I'll reach for Bain's Official Guide to CorelDraw 11."
1,Not as expected,"I expected to get a book where I could look up practically any common word and get a simile for it. None of the three words I needed for the project I was working on were even in there, nor were many common, well-known similes. Very disappointing."
5,Unique!,"Although the story lines are a bit busy in this fine film, the work turned in by Burt Lancaster and MacCaulay Culkin are truly worth seeing. The viewer is immediately aware of a bond between grandfather and grandson. Mac displays that rare talent of his, in this early film--what a fine portrayal and what an opportunity for him to be able to play opposite Mr. Lancaster."
1,A disappointment,I have a few other albums by Mannheim Streamroller that I enjoy. These set is not one of them. I found the music simplistic and plain. This set has moved to my inactive library stack.
3,Congo,CongoThought this started out a little slow for Crichtons writing but got pretty good and enjoyed reading this book. Adventure and wondering what would happen next kept it a good read.
2,Thrilling if you like slow-moving uneventful books,Why Read this? Poorly developed story line and not very interesting at all
4,"Good science, good work","Mark Plotkin takes the reader on a journey to the Amazon rainforests of Brazil and Suriname, along the way teaching about rainforest ecology, the medicinal plants and rituals of shamans, indigenous cultures, and his own scientific methods. Although his prose is at times tedious and repetitive, the story itself is a fascinating one, and his determination to give something back to the people of the region is admirable. The story unfolds in a way that allows the reader to understand what is happening to the rainforest both culturally and ecologically, and it offers not merely a criticism of western society but a set of reasonable solutions that could benefit the region, not just ecologically but economically. Plotkin is a responsible researcher whose work should be a model for future ethnobotanists."
5,Entheogens: Professional Listing,"""Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice"" has been selected for listing in ""Religion and Psychoactive Sacraments: An Entheogen Chrestomathy."""
2,"Justin in San Antonio, 11 yrs","I thought the book was okay, but it might be more suitable for small kids. Some of the poems had made up words that were kind of like Dr. Suess type words. That's why I think little kids would like it better.I did like Eric Carle's art in the book, and every poem had a picture with it that was colorful. I think it would be a good book for my little cousins because it was about animals and most of the poems were short so they won't get bored."
5,Beautiful Illustrations,"Like all Eric Carle's books this book havs wonderful illustrations. The poems appeal to children who love, or are interested in all types of animals."
1,No bubble wrap at all to protect product.,Item cam with a huge dent because there was absolutely no packing material to protect it.What were you thinking...
4,Very comfy seat,I''ve got a good deal on this! easy to assemble and its adjustableto three heights. Very lightweight too!Im very glad!
1,Save your money !,"The funniest part of this book are the ""mutilated"" names (i.e. Laord Valuemart, The Dork Forces, etc), and that probably says it all.While it is somewhat amusing to imagine a ""grown up"" Harry Potter who feeds off his notoriety, that's not enough to make a good parody.My advice : save your money for the next Harry Potter book !"
1,Huh?,"J.K. Rowling already wrote incredibly good books to read. Seriously, what is the point of this parody. It's a complete waste of time to read this."
3,"Rich writing, but a weak plot","I bought the book knowing that Proulx's writing style would keep me engaged. It did. But the plot just was not believable, and too romantic. Near the end, I felt myself rushing to finish the book. In my view, the Shipping News remains her one and only world-class book."
1,Environmentalist pamphlet in hardcover,"This is not a novel. It is a political tract, the platform of the Green Party/Sierra CLub fundraising letter, with no characterization and less plot. Unless you are already a diehard lefty, it will have nothing to say to you. Avoid."
5,Delightful!,"This book paints a vivid portrait of the Texas Panhandle - the scenery (breathtaking), the weather (unpredictable), and especially the people (strong, eccentric). It tells the story of a young man who goes to a small farming community in the panhandle to find land for corporate hog farms (hog farms are highly unpopular among the locals). During his stay, he gradually becomes part of the local community and he begins to get a sense of what he really wants to do with his life. The local characters that inhabit this story are absolutely delightful."
3,Good,"Proulx's gift of character invention is on display again in this bright, warm-hearted novel about an awkward misfit making his way among the old kooks and rawhide toughmen of the Texas Panhandle. The panorama of scenery, folkways and crusty dialogue pleases thoroughly. If all that is the flicking flame of ""Ace,"" the historical background Proulx provides is the furnace of embers that gives off the real heat. She writes fantastically about regional origins and eccentricities. On a down note, the plot is by and large flimsy - a clockwork series of events that ultimately feels very canned."
2,Doesn't seem like the same author,"I adore every one of Annie Proulx's works of fiction. Except this one. It is little more than a series of short anecdotes, almost none of which rises to the level of any of her previous writing. The main character, whose sole reason for existence in the book is to drive around and listen to people talking, is as flat and dry as the Texas panhandle she writes about. The storyline of his inner conflict about his job and the issue of pig farms never really gets into second gear. This would be okay if it was written with the same unique and artful use of language that is the trademark of Proulx's writing. But it isn't. After the striking, monumental beauty and passion of her Close Range stories, it doesn't seem like the same author."
1,WORST EVER,IF THIS ISNT THE WORST JAZZ CD IVE HEARD THAN I DONT KNOW WHAT IS I BOUGHT THIS CD THINKIN IT WAS GOIN TO BE SMOOTH JAZZ OF AALIYAH SONGS AND IT SOUNGS LIKE THE SAXAPHONE WAS SICK I MEAN IT SOUNDED HORRIBLE EXCEPT FOR THE LAST SONG BUT WHOEVEVER PLAYED THE INSTRUMENT NEED LESSONS CUZ THEY SUCKED AND THEY WASNT EVEN REALLY GOIN WITH THE WORDS THEY WERE SO OFF KEY (HELP WANTED KENNY G) WARNING!!!!!! EXTREMLY DANGEROUS I ADVISE NO ONE TO BUY THIS UNLESS U WANNA HER A SICK INSTRUMENT!!!!
1,Creole Fires,"Well, I guess I am the lone ranger. This book bored me to death. I got so sick of the slave/not slave, marriage/not marriage. I have seen too many romance novels like this where the heroine always wants to marry and the hero just wants a mistress and ""proper"" wife suited to his great wealth and standing. Really can't someone come up with something more interesting than this. I had a real hard time even finishing it."
3,Mail Box,"As advertised, quick delivery, replacement of original which lasted 5 years before coating coating came off. Good value for money"
4,Mail Box,"Received the package as promised by Amazon, in good condition and installed it. We are very happy with it. We would recommend it to friends and family."
5,A compelling and insightful metaphysical study of cosmology,"Race And The Cosmos: An Invitation To View The World Differently by Barbara A. Holmes (Associate Professor of Ethics and African American Religious Studies, Memphis Theological Seminary) is a compelling and insightful metaphysical study of cosmology, race, and what it means to awaken to full liberation. From the eternal quest for finding meaning to one's life, to interpreting what it truly is to be reasonable and tolerant in the grand scheme of things, Race And The Cosmos is offers a new and recommended look at the basic philosophies that shape our lives and how we view the universe."
1,A disappointment,I own all of the other Houston Junior league Cookbooks and am thrilled with them but this one left me sorely disappointed. It may be because it was their first book but the type and quality of recipes are not up to the standard I expect of the ones they have since produced. Waste of money
2,Not worth the money,"This is a rehash of what most pros already know. If you're brand new to a job requiring you to oversee print production, then it may be marginally useful. It would be better to buy your printer rep lunch and pick their brain."
3,Broad look at Basque culture,"A generally interesting overview of most things Basque; literature, history, food, politics, art. Would have liked to see more emphasis on the source questions; where did the Basque come from? It's touched on, but it seems likely that DNA study (especially mitochondrial DNA) would give us some fairly good ideas. Recipes are an interesting touch to the book. I think the author has a fairly sympathetic view of ETA, more than is justified by their actions over the past few years. Still, a good introduction to the subject."
2,A sectarian and misinformed depiction of the Basques,"As a Basque person, I find this book a poisonous gift. Kurlansky has obviously enjoyed his time amongst us (probably while researching his excellent book on cod) and all that cider at the ""sidreria"" has somehow gone up to his head while writing about the Basque Country. With the craft of an experienced storyteller, he manages to put together all the cliche, victimism, and bigotry that is still afflicting us. Ironically, his passionate tale helps to understand why so many people are still today passionately murdered, kidnapped, tortured, and forced to exile. Gezurrak (edo sasiegiak) ez dira askatzaileak: Lies and half-truths do not liberate us."
3,"It's a history, it's a cook book... it's both?","Yes, it's an interesting book about an interesting subject but it does seem to go on some tangents. The inclusion of recipes (like I can find baby eels in Fayetteville) gets to be a little annoying at times. A great work to get familiar with this unique people but it's heavily colored by the author's thesis about Basques in the EU. It might be good to supplement it with a more conventional book on Basque folkways and culture."
3,"""Made in America"", printed and bound in India","Is there something wrong with that information on the cover page? A book about all the great things that were ""MADE"" in America... and the ingenuity and ""American Spirit"" behind it (the book is a little bit of an advertisement for American invention), and then it's outsourced? WHAT? Bad, bad message, Fall River Press.The information overall is good, but I have one major complaint. For nearly EVERY item, the author describes it as ""The birth of"" ""The birth of"" ""the birth of"".... ""It was born"" ""and it was born."" Over and over and over. It gets kind of nauseating after a while."
5,Face conversations you've avoided with poise and confidence,Congratulations to Susan Scott for writing a book that will inevitably help many who have developed patterns of avoidance in their most important conversations to approach them with confidence and poise. This book will change lives!Joseph Grenny
1,DISAPPOINTING - NOTHING NEW,"I bought this book with the hope that I would find something new in ""Fierce"" but instead found the same old clichés that have been around for a long long time. The author uses quotes for other literary people in an attempt to provide credibility for ideas that have been around the block before and frankly have been better presented by others. This book is a complete disappointment."
2,Didnt like it,looks comfortable in the photo but it doesnt keep anything warm. Go with a dickies beanie they're better and have that last long feeling.
3,Not sewn right!,"The way mine was sewn makes me look like a cheap ass (guess I am for buying this). The little flap above the visor in the photo is not straight. Mine goes up and down, its so ugly that I have to wear this hat with the visor backwards (like a regular beanie). I think a blind person sewed mine. I am not sure how this has so many good reviews, I am wondering if they are all genuine."
5,I love this Product,"This is a wonderful product. It works as advertised. I can no longer get this product in Portland, Oregon. I hope it hasn't been discontinued. I had to use Dap Seal and Peel. I don't like it. It has a very strong odor that lingers a long time."
4,a classic revisited and enhanced,"The original, called Pure Pop for Now People, in the US, was one of the great underappreciated albums of the British new wave. Nick somehow found time between producing Elvis Costello and everyone else to do this fine work himself. The original CD is enhanced by lots of bonus tracks, featuring the top musicians of his scene. The songs have melody and wit."
4,A review of an immensely obscure album,"Overall, this album gets a B+. There are some bad songs on the album (Shades of Love and Moonlight at Cove Castle come readily to mind.), but there are also some terrific songs, such as Nocturne and Homage to Thomas Campion.The album has generally a melancholy feel to it; most of the songs are not happy ones. But, most songs are quite good and are nice to listen to, especially when in a somber mood.Any Chip Davis or New Age fan would benefit from buying the album, especially to hear the great piano playing of Jackson Berkey or to hear the fun percussion and synthesizer sounds in Nubian Dance."
2,"Some pluses, but they don't outweigh the drawbacks","Not highly recommended, but the book has some nice pluses. First, I generally find that lift-the-flap books keep little ones interested when you are reading to children of different ages. The book also counts backwards rather than forwards. My mother-in-law, who sent the book, is a teacher and has said that children are unable to count backward from ten to one when they enter school. This book nicely counts down from 7 with 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 more egg to go. However, the language in the book is nothing to write home about: I could create a more compelling story line. So while the lessons of learning to count backward can be appreciated by an adult, the kids are disinterested in the text after only a few readings."
1,Utter nonsense,"...Although there are exceptions, In reality most Jehovahs Witnesses are extremely well educated in scripture and are happy balanced individuals. It is the duty of every christian to test out what he learns to ascertain the truth in it, and it would be more beneficial to experience Jehovahs Witnesses personally than to take the misguided evidence of an ex witness with an extremely large axe to grind."
1,Base your views on the scriptures,"I am not a Jehovahs Witness but am a bible student who is familiar with their literature. A biased, unscriptural work such as this is not a book that inspires confidence in the true bible student. If you have a genuine interest in spiritual matters then I feel that prayer would be a better method of seeking truth than that of a man who clearly has his knowledge based on his own understanding, which I feel is written more from the point of view of an embittered man rather than that of someone who has the humility, patience, love and understanding of a true Christian"
3,Issac Newton the Sleuth,"London at the turn of the century, 17th, that is, is a place of intrigue and mystery. Will the recoinage fail and cause England to be destroyed by France and the Catholics? The mystery is deepened with each new murder, but, is Issas Newton, and his faithful sidekick, up to solving the case? Read on, and learn. This book was a little tedious, but it had its moments."
1,S is for Silence,"Worst book I have ever tried to read! You Lost it girl! Your books were great, what happened?"
1,What a disappointment.,"I have read all the Kinsey series, and as another reviewer says, am wondering who really wrote this book. It was a tedious read, seeming to require a written list to keep track of the characters. The ending was incoherent, with all sorts of loose ends left dangling out there. I don't quarrel with the cold case aspect as much as I do with the flipping back and forth in time..what was the purpose of this? The whole book seemed so contrived. I don't know whether I will even read the next in the series."
4,a challenging read,"Ultimately, I enjoyed ""S is for Silence"", but there were some bumps along the way. Mostly because there were so many characters (past and present) I had some trouble keeping them straight. The flashback method of telling the story tended to distract me as well, the changing perspectives made it harder for me to follow the narrative at times. It was interesting to see the victim through so many eyes though. It is a grim story about grim lives and there isn't much relief to the darkness. The writing gave me thoughts of Raymond Chandler at times. But the lyricism of Chandler's writing somehow lifts the reader out of the bleakness and squalor of the lives he describes. And Grafton's Kinsey Milhone doesn't seem to have Marlowe's self awareness. But it was still a compelling story. This is the first Grafton I've read in a long time and I'll probably go back and read the other letters of the alphabet."
3,Didn't understand motive for killing,"I really enjoyed the style of going back in time and then coming back to the future. I also think Ms. Grafton does a great job describing characters and scenes. The biggest problem I had was I did not understand why the killer did the killing. He already had money that his wife didn't know about -- why should he commit a killing unless he was just greedy. Also all through the story, Violet goes from one man to another but she never gets too interested in anyone. Why should she pack clothes to leave with this guy. He wasn't even that interesting. If he promised her something I must have missed it."
5,S is for Silence,"I own all of Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone mysteries series except the last three (T, U, and V) but I will, soon, for they are on my wish list! I really do hope that after ""Z"" comes along we don't see this character Kinsey Millhone disappear! I would really miss her! Like some of the reviews say, ""some of her books are better than others"" but I like them all and I liked this one. This is one series I WILL NOT be donating to my local library! Thank you Sue Grafton for such wonderful adventures!"
4,enjoyable read,"I liked the book even though the surprise ending was not exactly satisfying. I guess I was looking forward to being right about ""who dunnnit"" and then I was wrong. I also would like to be more clear on what happened to Violet's money - did she even have any? Did Tom end up with it, then? Did the Pom breeder realize she was endangering Kinsey's life? Why didn't Kinsey call the homicide detective as soon as she got Ty's info about the truck? But I thought the flashback chapters worked extremely well - just when you got caught up in what was happening to the characters back in the 50s she switched to the present again. Also the adolescent relationships were dead on - glad I'm not 14 again. Overall, a very good read. And, folks, of course the series is getting a little old: it IS old. so what, I look forward to the next one."
4,Another great mystery,I have read through this series to this point. I listened to this as an audio book. This was written differently from Ms. Grafton's other books with the parallel between the 50s and 80s-I enjoyed it. This kept me guessing until the end! Pick this one up!
5,THE BEST,I LOVED THIS BOOK. THEN AGAIN I LOVE ALL OF SUE GRAFTON BOOKS. ESPECIALLY HER KINSEY MILLHONE MYSTERIES. I CANT WAIT TILL SHE WRITES A NEW ONE. I GOT HOOKED FROM THE VERY BEGINING. AFTER I READ THEM I PASS THEM ON AND I ALWAYS GET A HEY THAT BOOK WAS AWSOME!!!!!!!!!
5,S is for Silence,"Very good as all of Sue Grafton's books have been. I love the character, Kinsey Millhone. She is a great detective. Great mysteries. Keeps you guessing who the criminal is up until the very end."
1,So what and who cares,"I've read all of Grafton's novels, and they vary tremendously in quality. Of the past 6 books, I'd say 2 were really good, the rest mundane.This one is the latter, easily. As I read the books and learned about the the characters, I thought ""so what"". As I read the end, I thought ""who cares"".The sentence structure is short and overly simple. The book is indicative of the ""dumbing down"" of American mystery literature in the case of many authors, where the publishers are getting writers to script to the lowest common demominator in reading circles. Just compare this book to Elizabeth George to see the difference in good versus very weak writing. When I finished ""S"", I moved immediately to start reading the first book by John Morgan Wilson - after one chapter the difference was crystal clear. I'm moving on to Wilson's 2nd novel and am not caring much about Kinsey's future after being an avid fan of Grafton in the E and F days."
1,Did Sue Grafton really write this book?,"I have read every book in this series from the beginning and have enjoyed most all of them. This book has no relationship to the series, is boring, hard to follow and appears to be two different books that have been combined by alternating chapters, Book A is chapter 1, Book B is chapter 2 etc. I missed everything that is Kinsey and the Alphabet series. I would not recommend this book, don't waste your money if you are looking for a good Kinsey mystery this is not it. In fact, this is not a good mystery of any sort. The ending was like an after thought just plucked from mid air and dropped in. Frankly I do not believe Sue Grafton wrote this but must have hired a Ghost writer."
1,YAAAAWN!,"This is the first Grafton book that bored me to sleep. 'nuff said.Please, please return to your old style and not bore us to death with things that are detailed to the max, when these things deal with matters in the 1950s and 1960s."
4,Good One,I thought that S is for Silence was one of her best. I don't think Kinsey was missing in action as another post mentioned. I think the author wanted to tell a good story not so much revolved around Kinsey and she did just that. I think Violet carried the story well on her own - she was most interesting and so were the supporting characters. A good whodunit until the end.
1,Stopped working after 4 months,"The product looked good. Nice design and some what appealing. Button was soft too. It worked without any issue for 3-4 months. Then one fine day it stopped responding. Tried replacing batteries. No luck. The original button (which I got with the Heath Zenith door-bell) was having similar issues, that's why I bought this button.Looks like they need to invest on Quality of Push-button. Their Door-bell designs are good, but disappointed on the push-button reliability."
4,Wireless doorbell,Nice enough wireless doorbell. However I am disappointed it is so hard to find a wireless one with a light in it. Other than that it is a nice one for the kitchen door inside the garage.
4,The Tiger's Tail,"Goood movie, very interesting story line, well acted. Wish Ciaran Hinds had a bigger part. Again a very good Irish movie."
5,Excellent reeds for beginners,"I bought these reeds with a brand new Selmer prelude clarinet hoping I could teach myself to play the clarinet and get the nice tone I wanted.BUT then I was afraid that I made a wrong purchase because I've been hearing that Vandorens are harder to play on and that they're actually half a strength harder than the other brands so I also purchased 2.5 and 2.0 Rico Royal reeds. 2.0 just sounded so buzzy. 2.5 was okay but it felt too soft on my mouth and looking at my tuner, the notes came out a bit flat. I finally decided to open my 2.5 strength Vandorens (and it is true that it is thicker and stiffer by a very very veeeery small margin) and after wetting the reed for about a minute in my mouth, it sounded so great! I played a perfectly pitched full scale the very very first time I tried it! I've had the clarinet for an hour and the Vandorens on for 15 minutes and I've picked up basic tunes already."
1,This Is Not Nick Lowe & His Cowboy Outfit,"This Mp3 download is being perpetuated under Nick Lowe's billing. There is no connection to Nick Lowe with any of this band's output. The reviews that are posted on here have nothing to do with this album. You will find the same reviews under the product that these reviews refer to. If you think you are downloading Nick Lowe's album ""Nick Lowe & His Cowboy Outfit"", you are not. This is some band named the Outfit unrelated to Nick Lowe."
5,"Works very well, a little wierd to 'focus'","I use this directional antenna to push my wi-fi through a hole in a tree canopy, to an outbuilding 330 feet away. The hole is not very large, but with the help of a Hawking signal booster my signal reception quality is 100%.The only negative is the focus. I wish Hawking would inscribe an alignment marking on their product so that aiming the antenna could be less guesswork. My installation is not high up in the air, but rather on the ground peeking thru the canopy of a huge Oak tree that is in direct line-of-sight to my outbuilding. A small amount of pruning, and the signal gets through."
1,Didn't work for me,I needed to extend my wireless about 250 feet for a webcam. The antenna was in clear view of the camera. I kept losing packets so the camera was to choppy. I read that they recommended that I should get two antennas. That was not an option for me because of the location.Tech support was overseas and it was a joke. All they said was that this is a good product that usually doesn't have problems.There is no way to see if it is even working. No lights nothing...Maybe two antennas would work better. I was disappointed that it did not work because I still do not have a solution.
4,Ronnie Milsap - Christmas with Ronnie Milsap,Received item timely. This is a nice CD for Christmas music. It was a gift for my husband. We both love Ronnie Milsap's music.
5,Great book,"the book covers every kind of sauce you could imagine, so it's a great reference as well as a ""recipe"" book. I love to make my own sauces to that I can control the additives, and this book takes the guesswork out of figuring out quantity as well as quality."
4,Good for all cooking levels,"Having the basics of cooking down, I was looking for a cookbook that would give me more flavor options to the basics I already have. I choose this book based on the tons of recipies and its orgainization into the types of sauces.The directions are very easy to follow! I've tried 4 recipes, each a different type of sauce, and they have turned out well.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that some of the ingredients are harder to find in a small city, and some are expensive as well."
1,Kiosk <1,Poorly written script and poor editing results in a a mess of a story direction; just a mishmash of disjointed scenes. It's as if they added a bit of American western with gangsters with an assassination and assassins for them; then add in police that seem drawn from keystone cartoon cops with a little bit of Hollywood style chase scenes and shootouts. The story was hard to follow; the acting seemed artificial acting-like. I don't get headaches but this movie gave me one from both lack of believable story to awkward cinematography.
1,did not need,I am not a mechanic but can change my own oil and plugs etc.Ask for a rebuild kit from dealer for about 50$
1,arrived broken 2X,This scooter arrived with the wiring harness broken. I called amazon and they sent out a replacement immediately.2nd scooter had the wiring harness broken again in the same location! ( no it was not the same one)VERY poor design.
1,Enormously bad.,"Okay. In two words, ""It sucked."" In about eighty-five words, ""A depressingly simplistic plot with its flesh stretched achingly taut by unengaging filler. Characters that are difficult to remember, much less care about, from page to page, much less from chapter to chapter. No interesting twists that aren't forced and eye-rollingly predictable. No depth. And it doesn't save itself by being written well. This book is written with the same textureless and highly pretentious style of prose as the first-try novelette produced by freshman in High School who tells everyone he'll be a writer when he grows up."""
4,Eastern Cultured Alien Bunnies,"One of the more amusing first contacts I've read. Giant many-toed rabbits come to Earth and hide, not realizing from stellar surveys their planet of choice had intelligent life already. Quozl are extremely like bunnies, including the need for a high amount of sexual encounters. (In some sense you could call this a 'furry' book, but that isn't the focus.) After they make contact, it's a fun, quirky fast-paced story. Eastern culture defines their art, and their philosophy is steeped in martial arts and violence. This contrasted well with the tendency to think of bunnies as 'cute'.I enjoyed Quozl just as much on the re-read through. (Still find 'hiding behind his feet' a funny mental picture.)"
3,THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES YOU ONLY NEED TO SEE ONCE.,"THE PREVIEWS OF THE MOVIE DIDNT CONVINCE ME, WHICH MADE ME NOT WANT TO SEE THE MOVIE RIGHT AWAY. IT WAS THE CONVINCING OF SOMEONE ELSE THAT MADE ME GO. AND MUCH TO MY SURPRISE, I ENJOYED IT! THE STARRING ACTORS SUCH AS NAS, DMX, AND T.HICKS PLAYED THEIR PARTS; BUT WHEN I HEARD THAT TION WATKINS WASNT THERE TO REHEARSE WITH EVERYONE ELSE,IT SHOWED. I COULD'VE PLAYED THE PART JUST AS BAD. OTHER THAN THAT THE MOVIE WILL BE ADDED TO MY COLLECTION AT HOME. HYPE DID MUCH BETTER THAN MOST ON HIS FIRST TRY AT THE ""BIG SCREEN""."
4,This Film is Better Than I Expected,"While some acting is bad, some is exciting in this movie directed by Hype Williams. DMX is on fire for this being his first movie and while Nas is obviously meant to be a rapper, he also does a pretty good job. The supporting cast is really good although T-Boz sounded a little fake in some scenes. The Jamaican druglord is probably the best character in this film with the exception of DMX, because he's so dangerous and he smarts off even when he's taking on an entire hit squad by himself.--Main point= Belly is a film for fans of urban/gangster flicks and this one definitely is one of the better ones."
5,A Good Hip Hop Story,A classic true hip hop story.DMX can play this role perfectly and Nas is a great supporting actor.
1,Horrible,This dvd didn't even work. I tried it in all of my DVD players and it did not work in any of them. What a waste of money. Think twice before you buy DVDs over the internet!!!!
3,"Slick debut, but poorly conceived","Ultra-cool cinematography is what makes this flick worth seeing. From the thermal visuals of the opening club shootout to the rusty, corroded ghettos of Jamaica, Belly is magnificent eye candy. I love a director who isn't afraid to experiment! But, alas, the plot is thin, the dialogue thinner and many crime drug themes are stolen from other crime classics (see Godfather, Scarface, Goodfellas). And I couldn't understand what the hell that Jamaican kingpin was saying until subtitles were added late in the movie! Nice try Hype. Try getting Scorcese to write your next screenplay. That might be something worth a theater release."
1,Should be rated PG for Pure Garbage!,"Another in a long line of cinematic ghettto garbage which pretends to be a cautionary tale but actually glorifies the high rolling lifestyle of dope dealing thugs, with fancy cars, fancy clothes, fast women, ad nauseum. The prentense of positivity reaches it's peak with a sermon at the end by the infamous Min. Benjamin Chavis Muhammad. To keep from adding further misguidance to kids who are already misguided, Magic Johnson wisely banned this ... from his theater chain! Go Magic! You da man!"
2,pretty cheesy,"Big fan of Nas, but this moive's a bit over the top and have some good messages that suffer because of it. Visually flashy, vacant plot, and messages are reduced to sermonizing. Skip this and watch Juice instead."
4,Art imitiating life in a dark mood; better than expected,"Like some people, when I first saw this movie on cable I was like, 'Great, another film about drugs and violence in the hood'. But after seeing a few more times, I actually dig this film more than some of the others I've seen. The dark lighting and overall dark mood reflect the dark clouds of sadness, despair and gloom that cover Black America due to poverty, drugs, and violence. Very clever. Besides, anyone that knows anything about real mobsters and gangstas(from any generation) knows that many of them are nightowls anyway. I had a hard time understanding the language(they should have also used captions on X, Nas, and Meth in some scenes), but it added to vibe of the film. Some parts remind me of old school films like Casino, Deep Cover, the Harder they Come, and the Godfather series because of the ruthless, unfeeling nature of the characters. Good film to watch late at night."
2,FAKE UP NORTH TYPE.....,"I ONLY GAVE THIS MOVIE 2 STARS BECAUSE DMX T-BOZ AND TARAL HICKS WERE GOOD. I AM ALSO TIRED OF SEEING OUR PEOPLE MAKING IT SEEM AS THAT IS OUR WORD. THAT IS WORLD OF A DRUG DEALER, NOT ALL BLACK MEN ARE. WE NEED MORE MOVIES LIKE THE BEST MAN AND THE WOOD THOSE ARE MORE REALISTIC. I NOT SAYING SAYING THAT THIS MOVIE IS ALL FAKE BECAUSE SADLY ENOUGH THERE ARE WAY TO MANY BLACK MEN LIVING THIS LIFE BUT WHY SHOULD WE HYPE IT UP, WE SHOULD BE SHOWING OUR KIDS THAT THAT IS NOT THE LIFE TO LEAD. THE ONLY THING THIS SHOWED WAS IF YOU SELL THEN YOU CAN LIVE IN A PHAT HOUSE, DRIVE PHAT CARS, AND THAT YOU MAY HAVE BEEF WITH THE COPS AND OTHER DEALERS BUT IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING YOU'LL BE ALRIGHT IN THE END. IN THE ENDING NAS TELLS T-BOZ LETS MOVE TO AFRICA. WHAT! NAS IS ANOTHER REASON I'D DIDN'T LIKE THIS MOVIE. HE CAN'T ACT HE SOUNDS LIKE HE IS STRAIGHT READING OFF SOME CARD OR SOMETHING. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BORROW IT FROM SOMEBODY."
4,entertaining,"What this movie lacks in plot, it makes up for in visual special effects. I think Hype Williams took a lot of criticism for conducting this movie like a lengthy music video but I think that it is actually the movie's strong suit. Likewise, I think while the movie might not be up to par with the ""great"" gangsta flicks like The Godfather or Scarface, it wisely does not try to emulate them either.I also liked the all-star hip hop cast/cameos such as Method man, T-Boz, Nas, DMX, etc. Also, I've been hooked on some of the movie from the film like D'Angelo's ""Devils Pie"" and the acapella version of ""However Do you Want Me?""Finally, though not fully developed, I think the director attempts to convey a message of self-improvement for the hip-hop community which I think was commendable."
3,I'm not go lie to you,"This movie wasn't garbage, this movie was not the bomb. It had the usual guns, drugs, and alcohol,you see in all gangsta movies. Some acting skills need some tuning but Hype put his touch on it which made it unique, the story was somewhat unoriginal but it ended on an uplifting note. Its definitely a good movie to see"
1,Garbage...,there should be no other words to describe this travesty. It has no cinematic value WHATSOEVER... the END OF HIP HOP MINSTRELS... I agree with the level-headed reviewers... not these teen-age suburban white kids who are the ones buying stereotypic images of our people.
4,So Psyched These are Here!,"It's so nice to see the first seasons of what must be the most underrated Star Trek ever. So contemporary in the way it deals with themes that confront us right now: The push-and-pull of religiously-based cultures vs. humanistic ones, the stress of constant war, questions about rebuilding a society that has been destroyed by exploitation and occupation, and examining how people from very different backgrounds can find ways to work together.Dark in tone, by Star Trek standards, but in an enlightening way....."
1,BEWARE: Since DS9 this is not Star Trek anymore!,"Weak scripts, boring episodes, overrated ""Q"" and nothing to do with the starship Enterprise and the idea of Gene Roddenberry... a ... spinn-off of the real Star Trek series, regardless of the DVD itself."
3,"Garak, Lursa/B'Etor, Kira loyalty, inconsequential","If you have not seen DS9, and have never seen this episode, then see it (All Trek is worth watching once). We meet Garak in this episode, and there's a small guest appearance by The Klingon Duras sisters: Lursa and B'Etor. The episode is about Kira's loyalty, yadda, yadda. A character-building episode that is inconsequential to the overall story of the series. OK to Skip. 2.9/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin"
3,A Ferengi Leader,"Ferengi on the station. More specifically, this episode is about their leader, the Nagus. (Come on, really?) I'm much more into the story of DS9 than the leader of the alien fools of the galaxy. I mean, we learn some disgusting Ferengi customs, but the plot really doesn't have much to do with the Star Trek: Deep Space 9 story arc (except that there are so many Ferengi episodes we have to endure later in the series). I'm kinda over it after a view or 2. Pro: the acting was kinda good. And somewhat important to one of the subplots of DS9 (Nog - first Ferengi in Starfleet) 3.4/5 stars. It's still Trek, but not the best episode. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
5,The Begining,"This is the first season of what I believe to be the most interesting Star Trek Series created. Unquestionably the most action ever found in a Star Trek series ever. The series that even a non-treky will appreciate.The first season may not hold the best episodes of DS9, but has the clasics. where you see the characters develope into who they are in the later ones. You get to see how the relationship between the Bajorins and the Federation develops, to see how it all began, and to see how the charactors really work.The best episodes would have to be Captive Pursuit, The Nagus, Vortex, Battle Lines, The Storyteller, and In the Hands of the Prophets. These are also the most influential to the comming seasons. I hope you enjoy the seasons as much as I do and be sure to make them a part of your collection."
4,Star Trek Forever,"I love the Star Trek series. I hope that they come out with every single episode of Star Trek in all 5 series on DVD. They did a much better job of extras on DS9 than they did on TNG. One thing that I hope they would do is have a play all for each disk. That way, we could just put a disk in and watch all 4 hours. I know there weren't many people that were DS9 fans. I have to admit, I wasn't much of one when it was on until the Dominion wars started, but I think this collection is worth it."
3,Fun Episode,"This episode is fun. But that's all it has going for it. It's one of those light-hearted ""filler"" episodes that doesn't have to do with anything. To be honest, I'd almost forgotten this episode. But it was fun, and did keep a smile on my face. So I'm giving it a 3.4/5 stars for that. But if you're not a Trekkie, you can skip this one. I'm afraid most of Season 1 doesn't have much to do with the overall story arc. Keep On Trekkin."
3,Oh really?,"When it ended, I was like ""thats it""? The part of those two kids trading stuff was fun, but I never know if they got their gold press latinum. And that part with that old Bajorian man kinda went on as expected. It was basically a typical day in the life of Starfleet..."
3,"Should be called ""Solitaire""","This Episode should not have been made. I LOVE STAR TREK. But I ended up playing solitaire through half of it, and really wanted to scene skip, but also wanted to write a review. I sat and watched all of it again. It's pretty boring, and has nothing to do with the story of Deep Space Nine. It's about Kira and her transitions, and more about Nog. I would not pay to see this episode. 2.8/5 Stars. Keep On Trekkin'"
4,Solid Star Trek Science Fiction Story,"I liked this episode. Thumbs up and all that. Probably because I like Star Trek. It's a solid Science Fiction story with lots of depth (and some explosions). A mystery worthy of the name ""Star Trek."" Cons: Doesn't do much for the series storyline, and a couple scenes of bad acting. But sometimes the cheese works, and in this episode, it does. If you like Star Trek, you'll probably like this episode. 3.9/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin"
5,Tons of Info...,"I recently purchased this book, and I am very impressed. I have looked at 2 other books on the Pharmaceutical Industry, and this one by far has the most information. This book lists so many companies and their medicines, that I've saved countless hours of research. Also, the tutorial on how to talk about a product based on the FDA information was extremely helpful, as were the definitions in the back of the book."
3,The Beginning of the Light at the End of the Tunnel,"I have to agree with the reviewer who titled their review ""Thank Goodness for Kevin Murphy."" Kevin's Tom Servo is where MST3K really fell into place and found its comedy heart. Elvis Weinstein as Servo had his moments, but Kevin turned the little gumball machine into a real character. The beginnings of MST3K often look like just that, beginnings. A formula had yet to be worked out and the jokes don't shine like they do later. Thankfully, The Crawling Hand is actually a pretty likeable movie with some interesting B-movie ideas. As there is more silence between jokes with this MST3K crew, you get to listen to great big chunks of this movie and it's actually pretty good. This show is definitely one of the better ones of the 2nd season ... the third season would hit the ground running and become what we all know (knew) and loved."
3,incredibly obnoxious,"The toy is cute but I don't enjoy it too much when it's played because the main song is very annoying and the mechanical voice wears on me. But, the balls are a HUGE hit with my 1 year old, even if he plays with them on our coffee table rather than with the toy."
4,Great book,"I really liked this book and the rest of the series I don't see why it so short-lived. Victoria is caught between a rock and a hard place even though I usually hate her I felt sorry for her. And I'm really beginning to hate Nikki with her jealous attitude towards Suzanne. Suzanne is a better person than Nikki is, though."
1,two useless sides,I was very disappointed in this grater. The slicing side and the large grating side are the only two sides that are any use.
4,Good grater,I really like this grater. It's comfortable to use. It's sturdy. The grating surfaces are all very useful. The only complaint that I have is the handle fills with water in the dishwasher. It is already starting to rust.
4,Deluxe Grater,"What a great grater! Works perfect for our cheese grating needs. Large enough, solid design, and easy to clean in the dishwasher."
2,Only slightly diferent than pictured,"I'm a sucker for details and got excited about the possibility of detaching one or both of those long chains and replacing it with another, shorter alternative. The images shows a spiral connector inside the pouch that connects the pouch to the chains. Unfortunately, what's given is a clamped alternative (what acts much like the connection between your forefinger and thumb when you put them together to form a circle) that is much more challenging to replace. Additionally, the zipper quality is questionable. It's flimsy and seemingly unreliable. Will I keep it, Yes. Will I buy it again, No. Will I keep my eye open for a better alternative, Yes."
2,Was Smiley's approach flawed?,"I only got to p.193, after enjoying the novel for quite a while. It just didn't seem to be going anywhere, constantly broadening rather than deepening, so I couldn't stay involved.I offer some quotes from Smiley's ""Thirteen Ways of Looking at the Novel"" which may explain things. ""Rather than planning and working out in advance, as I had done with most of my earlier novels, I willingly entered a zone of randomness"". "" ...waited for inspiration. If it didn't seem to be precisely what I had expected, I went with it anyway. .....I didn't need to plan! I didn't need to work something out"". (p.10). Smiley really enjoyed herself writing the novel"
1,Horse H-E-Double Hockey Stick,"I was beside myself when Jane Smiley's latest book hit the shelves. I broke one of my golden rules, ""Never by Hardback!"" I have always enjoyed her tales of Midwestern angst. But, I have never been so disappointed in a book by such a seasoned author. Although I finished the five-hundred plus pages, I am still waiting for the character development to end. I found the narrative sloppy and cliche and the characters contrived. Ho Ho Ice Chill-please."
2,Horse Heaven,"If you like to read 10 books at once this is for you. While this book falls under 'literature' and not just a story, I feel Ms. Smiley bit off more than she could chew. Each character could have been a book in itself, or a series of stories. I love to read 'horse stories', and the author has a knack for presenting a different approach. I didn't really enjoy reading this one."
1,Horse Heaven,"This was the most boring audio book I have ever hear. The story was not interesting and the voices were either too loud or too soft half of the time. If this had been my first audio book, I never would have purchased another one."
1,Disappointed,"Sounds great according to the reveiws of other buyers, but everyone has different taste and I would not buy this unless i can listen to samples myself first. Come on Amazon!"
2,Frustrating - errors interfere with learning,"I bought this as a textbook for a college course. While the intro to Mac was helpful, and the author sets up and goes through real-life type projects in a logical manner, the many errors in the book interfere with learning. For example, the reader is told to press 'm' to access the move tool when pressing 'm' really accesses the marquee tool. Often when the examples are worked step-by-step they don't look like the finished product as shown in the book, especially when using text. Overall disappointing. And I've only gone through the photoshop part so far. I would have given them 3 stars if there was an errata page online that could help me. But there's not."
1,"Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach.","This takes the basic information that can be found in the manual or anywhere on the 'net and repackages it as yet another How-to computer book.Unfortunately, as mentioned above, it is full of errors and examples that make you cringe, both in taste and demonstrating the author doesn't really know how to do it.When you are reading how to correct a photo in Photoshop, nothing puts you off more than that the example shown is badly corrected. The same goes for all the aesthetically challenged examples and the book itself.How difficult is it to design and layout an attractive, easily navigated and organised book on graphic design if you are in fact a capable designer?Unless ofcourse you are not."
4,Up to Acrobat 6 Only,"This book has a lot of great, helpful information, but be aware that it stops at Acrobat 6. I don't think any of the reviews here mentioned that."
3,Almost perfect,"These towels look great, and feel great when you are dry. But, they are not thirsty enough for my tastes when you are toweling off after a shower. My wife, however, says she likes them better than our old towels (she give them 4 starts) and that I'm a towel prick (I give them 3). Your mileage may vary."
2,"Light Romance, Thriller & Lassie","Very light reading for the summer, it scratches on romance, crime investigation and a bit of snippets here and there of views from a dog. It is neither bad nor good, overall is just a simple book to kill some time you have at hand."
4,Good book. Needs to be indexed.,Overall good book with lots of information but it has more potential for kindle users if it was indexed so we could search it.
5,Great Practice,"This book while seemingly simple is an amazing tool for learning horse anatomy. I have really enjoyed the challenge of learning the lines and nuance of drawing these wonderful animals.Don't think this is just a kids book, it will help any artist of any level."
2,"Great style,size, features however electronics fail in several years","Ih replaced these lights 3 times over the last 6 years. I like the style, the motion sensor and the 2 light levels this light provides. However the electronics in these lights have failed on 3 seperate occasions."
1,"Don't buy it... I'll give it to you, if you want.","It's not for beginners. You will need other books to understand it. Most pages are too basic, and it suddenly introduces higher level stuff from nowhere.... The technical support will refer you ... - just use the website instead!"
4,Overall good air purifier,"I bought the Hamilton Beach 04492 True Air Tower Ionic Air Purifier about 2 months ago for my bedroom. I suffer from year-round allergy/sinuses, so my allergist recommended I buy an air purifier. I researched several air purifiers and decided on this one because it had pretty good reviews, and the price was very reasonable. My allergies have improved and overall the air seems cleaner. I like that it has an ""auto"" feature that automatically adjusts the fan speed depending on the air quality in the room. My only critique is that the permanent filter is hard to clean with a vacuum because of it's accordion shape. Overall, I'm glad I bought this air purifier."
1,The Vow by Druidstone is a much better choice,"While I was doing research for my book - The Traditional Irish Wedding - I wanted to be able to recommend as much authentic Irish music as possible for both the ceremony and the reception.The book came about because our daughter wanted a celebration reflective of her roots; we ended up with all Irish music for the ceremony, including a Celtic Mass. The same was true of the reception. There is so much great Irish music available that the problem for most couples will be deciding what to include and what to leave out. Except for The Irish Wedding Song and My Wild Irish Rose, it's my opinion that this particular CD is misleading as to its name and content."
2,The Title is Misleading,"I purchased the CD for 1 song, The Irish Wedding Song. It is beautiful. Outside of this track, there are maybe 2 other songs worth listening to, When You Were Sweet Sixteen and I Love You Because. This should not be billed as an Irish CD. Very little Irish about it. It is more country than Irish and has very little to do with a wedding."
3,Older songs.,The songs on this cd are very old and have that old hollywood sweet type of feel to them. Good for an older couple or a very old fashioned couple.
2,WARNING: Wrong Episode!,"This item is supposedly titled ""UFOs: The First Encounters."" It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation."
4,Hilarious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The movie (starring Jim Carrey) is about a man (Carrey) who is depress and dislike god. So, god gave him his powers (while on vacation) to show that man how's it like to have powers. It was hilarious!!! :D The man (Carrey) was also having fun. But it also became difficult for him (you'll see, if didn't watch it) that he realize things that he took for granted. So, watch it now (to see what I mean) and get ready to laugh!!! :D"
1,Painful,"BRUCE ALMIGHTY could have ended up being just your average lame Hollywood movie, lost amidst a sea of ill-conceived comic clunkers. Thanks to Jim Carrey's performance, however, this film is so bad that it's truly offensive. I'm not talking about the admittedly well-intentioned message of the movie or the way that it's portrayed, I'm referring to Carrey's need to portray what I'm assuming is supposed to be a gruff-but-likeable everyman as a vein-popping, physically out-of-control Ace Ventura clone. I don't recall enjoying a single minute of this movie in the theatre, except when I started to imagine Bill Murray in the role (though I doubt even he could have done much with the material here).Carrey can be funny and even likeable onscreen, but he needs a director who can control him, not the other way around (which I suspect is the problem with this film from the get-go). Even his die-hard fans may want to avoid this one."
2,bonus features included mastercard commercial....,"I do not consider it to be a bonus feature to get to watch a mastercard commercial (yes, this is listed as a choice in bonus features).What is really irritating with this DVD is that you have 4 or so previews of other movies that are advertised as coming to DVD before you get to the point where the DVD will let you into the menu to start the movie. I have to fast forward through previews to get past them (I am using WinDVD on my pc)."
4,Whining Jim Carrey gets God-like powers,"Carrey plays a miserable, complaining nobody who gets incredible powers after he offers to swop places with God. Some of the scenes after this are terrific fun.Morgan Freeman is God, and the weird thing is, he suits the role admirably!Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
1,An EVIL movie,"Let me get this straight, Morgan Freeman is God in this movie. Morgan Freeman was on Electric Company on PBS. PBS is the same station that produces Sesame Street. Sesame Street has the devil himself ""Elmo"". Elmo and the devil are both red, walk funny, and are pure evil. By this process we can prove this movie is about the devil."
1,A Waste,"What a waste of a good idea and a funny guy. Jim Carrey with almost Godlike powers, but he does nothing interesting with it. It's like going to Disneyworld and only hanging out at the snack bar the whole time. It's hard to believe anyone in the industry really has so little imagination. Even the old Chevy Chase stinker Modern Problems had more imagination."
3,By The Numbers,"I've been a fan of Jim Carrey since his ""In living Color"" days...and I've followed his movie career very closely.""Bruce Almighty"" is a bit of a let-down. Sure, it was nice to see Jim back in his zany role...but even then he seemed to be forcing things...which I find true of the entire movie...it all seems a bit forced and lacks any real ~flow~.Perhaps this has to do with the completely cliche and predictable script. It's hard to believe that the same Director who put Jim in a such a good place with ""Liar Liar"" and ""Pet detective"" could let his pal down so hard with this one.The other issue I have is with some folks saying that this was Carrey's ""return to form"" in terms of his crazy comedy bits.Did these people not see ""Me myself & Irene""? In my opinion, that movie is light years ahead of ""Bruce Almighty"" in terms of execution...and it was only two years ago!Not a bad Jim Carrey movie...but not a great one either.~dan"
3,Jim Carrey as God..... We're Doomed,"Jim Carrey specializes in being a maniac, moron, comedian, and a lust man in most of his movies. Just take ""The Mask"" and ""Dumb and Dumber"" for example. I personally went to see Jennifer Aniston's boobs get bigger, not to see the dog go to the bathroom one-too-many times. Otherwise, watch it, don't watch it, it's your choice."
4,A light-weight movie worth watching!,"Very entertaining movie - no disappointments from the movie or the star - Jim Carrey. Best was Morgan Freeman to Jim Carrey on top of Mount Everest - ""where are we, you got to flip to Discovery Channel sometimes boy - we are on top of everest'There is lot of spoof from few of the movies like 'The Green Mile', 'Ten Commandments' and 'The Matrix'. I should say Jim Carrey did not have lot of occassions to try his facial movements like he did in 'Liar Liar' or 'The Mask'. But he has done an excellent job. No need to tell anything about Morgan Freeman's acting - Class of his own!A light-weight movie worth watching. For detailed story, read other reviews that discusses in detail."
2,Not what I expected,"I wanted to buy this movie very much because I love Jim Carrey. The man cracks me up. I'm glad that I didn't purchase this movie though, because it was not what I expected. I'm very glad that my nephew's friend let us borrow his. The only scenes that were funny was when Jim first got his powers and he started singing ""I got the power"" by the '90's group Snap. And when he made the other news reporter talk gibberish. I thought that was hilarious. Other than that, it was not all that fantastic. It did however, have a good moral to the story. So please people, do not go out and waste your money on this one. Borrow it from someone like I did, and judge for yourself."
5,Papa's protege,"The best quality of this book is the clean language worthy of Hemingway. Samuelson had an ear for exact quoting. His manuscript lay in a trunk until after his death, when his daughter found it, and decided to publish. Lucky us."
2,Not the Eighth Edition!!!!!,Need the Eighth Edition of this book for my Calculus class. Got quickly which was GREAT but the actual book was not the Eighth Edition! It was the Canadian 1st Edition. Very disappointed in this. If you are going to give us the Canadian 1st Edition tell us!!!!!
3,Expensive for just Q-Jets,"Posted a thoughtful review to try to make up for Amazon's unfortunately common scant descriptions and incomplete specifications. Amazon mucked up the review so this is a second try.The quick version is that I used this well-made tool on an E4ME Rochester Quadrajet. It fits the lean adjusting mixture double ""D"" screw. It does not fit the idle mixture screws!Crimp a short length of 3/16"" over a file tang to make a tool for the idle mixture screws.The tool's a bit pricy if you're working on Q-Jets and only one socket is useful."
2,Not Much Appeal for a Male Reader,"There are very few male authors in this collection of stories. If you are considering purchasing this book for a preteen boy, I advise against it. While the stories are good, it took my reader no time at all to burn out on all of the ""girl"" stories."
4,Razor Scooter,Cool product and really neat product for my daughter who is 10. Only complaint is that it's really only a flat surface scooter. Even small hills are a challenge for this one.
5,razor pocket mod,"Although we have had snow since we purchased this and my daughter has only been using this indoors (waiting for spring), she loves it. It goes just fast enough to keep her happy and not ""too fast"" to make me nervous. All of her friends are jealous and also want one. I'm sure she will have many happy memories of this gift."
4,Nothing But Fun,"I purchased this item for my daughter in Feb. 07 for her 10th B-day. She loves it and says ""this is the best present ever"". It is a lot of fun. It goes fast but not too fast - it's just right. The seat lifts up w/ a little bit of storage space underneath.The only thing that I can't stand is the smell of the scooter. We don't have a garage so it stays in a closet area but it stinks! I think it's the rubber on the tires that smells so bad and Im hoping w/ more use, the smell will go away. Other than that - no complaints - we love it!"
5,AWESOME,"My daughter turned 10yrs old, so I got this for her birthday. She rides it EVERY chance she gets, and if she's not, her friends are on it. I can even ride it if i want, and I weigh about 180lbs. Highly recommended, and suprisingly fast. My only drawback would be that I would like it to have easily replacable battery, and be able to keep an extra on charge when she's riding it."
5,Scooter is great,"We bought this last year at Christmas, and battery is still great. My 8 year old daughter rides it to and from school and around the block nearly every day. Even in the cold! Worth the price"
4,Awesomeness Scooter,"My 11 year-old daughter bought this scooter after her friend got one, it came in the mail and it had a very quick assembly. Now my little girl is riding everywhere! And the battery was full charged when we got it, the only problem is that the charger didn't come with it so now we have to use her friend's until it comes in the mail, otherwise... ITS ROCKIN' COOL!i would get this product."
5,Wonderful ride,My seven years old daughter loves this scooter. She got it for Christmas 07 and she loves it. It just the right speed and height for her.
1,Battery won't hold a charge,"The scooter will not run for more them 5 minutes. We only had it a day and my little girl was so disappointed. We contacted razor and the said a battery is on the way, but we have been waiting two weeks and still no battery."
3,"Super fun, but a few problems","We bought 2 of these for our daughters for Christmas. Both of them came with a popped rear inner tube. Finding the tube was not easy, especially on Christmas. We had a neighbor who has one and he had 1 extra tube, so we took the wheel off and replaced 1. The other is at the bike shop, and I will have to pay for repairs. It was really fun, both my 6 and 7 year old daughters took turns and loved it. It went fast enough, but not too fast. I think it's for sure worth the $, but question how the maint. is going to go. We fully charged them, and the charge died quickly and it takes a long time to fully recharge. Of course, I had 2 kids taking turns, so it was constant use. Over all, I am glad we got them and if all goes well, they will be fun. Just bummed out about the back wheels."
4,Very Nice Scooter,"We bought this scooter for our 10 year-old grandaughter for Christmas. It was easy to install the handle-bar and the front wheel. We were ready to go. The ride seems to be good and the controls are easy for our grandaughter to use. She could not wait for the snow to melt, so she has been riding it around the family room. Except for a ""click"" when the motor engages the scooter seems to have sufficient power and is quiet running. Our grandaughter loves it!"
4,Pefect X-mas Gift,This was a great gift at a great price. The same item was 20-40 dollars higher in stores and I got free shipping.
5,Razor Pocket Mod,"I bought 2 of these for 2 of my grand daughters. They have only had them for a month or so, but so far they live up to expectations. I ordered this from Amazon, got free shipping and had it in less in a week."
1,Razor Regrets,"This darling scooter was purchased for a Christmas present and lasted ONE day--you then have to take it to an authorized repair shop where the cost to figure out what is wrong starts at $50. Think long and hard about buying this--you have to charge it EIGHT hours to get 40 minutes of ride time...it dies just as the fun gets started. The warranty starts the second it ships--so, if you are buying it for something special, wait til the last minute. We are disappointed and would not buy again, if given the chance."
4,A great choice for us,"I got 2 of these for my 8-year-old twin boys, and we absolutely love them. My wife and I are even having a blast on 'em (I weigh about 180lbs). We were a bit surprised initially by how fast these things go ---it does take a bit of getting used to, since the accelerator is really more of an on/off proposition, you tend to do use it in ""spurts"". The only mishap so far was caused by my wife, actually... Assembly was easy, and so far I have no complaints whatsoever..."
5,Razor pocket Mod,"I purchased this pocket razor for my granddaughter, she has been using it daily and it's difficult to get her off of it. It was easy to assemble and worked as promised. I do wish it would have let me know that most towns don't want children to use them.Shen loves it and it holds a charge well.Jim Paige"
5,A GREAT PRODUCT,WE PURCHASED THIS POCKET MOD FOR OUR 10 YR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS AND SHE LOVES IT. IT HOLDS CHARGE AND PERFORMS PERFECTLY. WE WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND IT.
3,Disappointed.,"Not disappointed in the product as a whole, it was purchased for my 10 year old grand daughter, who absolutely loves it, the big disappointment is the time the battery lasts, Seems a different type of electrical system would have helped. The fact that the battery does not last long, and the fact it takes many hours to recharge it. Just does not seem right. I think 1 bigger 12v battery, would have been much better than 2 12v batteries, in series to make 24v would have been a much better system. The batteries are simply too small, and they take too long to recharge."
5,Awesome Scooter,I bought this for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it. The scooter is recommended for ages 12 and up but I think it would be a bit small for anyone over the age of 12. Suppervision is neccessary - the scooter is quite fast.
5,Very Pleased with this Scooter!,"We just bought this for our 11-year old. We were a little worried getting a scooter this size, because she is so tall (5' 4"".) But after we read the reviews, we thought we'd give this a try. We're really glad we did. It was easy to assemble and charge and it works great. We all have fun riding around our neighborhood on it. And it's VERY quiet, too. The size is not a problem at all. We feel it was a good value for the money."
1,Buyer Beware,"I bought the Razor Pocket Mod (Betty) for my Grandaughters Birthday & within a week I was looking for someone who serviced these scooters. They said it was the battery so two days later I picked it up & before she could enjoy her new scooter, it was back in the shop because the motor was bad. They had to order the motor & as of today 9.25.10, it's still in the shop & has been for two weeks now.I was going to order my other Granddaughter one but after the first trip to the shop, I went to Wal-Mart & got her one & she's had it for three weeks now with no problems at all."
2,constantly broken!!!,"I have purchased two of the Razor mopeds (against my educated, better judgement....but hard to see your child not riding when all of their friends are!).In a three year period I have bought 4 batteries $59/each), 3 tires ($13/each), an electrical circuit ($35) and fuses. They are CONSTANTLY in repair!!!On the positive: when working my daughter and her girlfriends LOVE to ride around the neighborhood!"
4,Daughter loves it.,This Christmas gift was a hit with my 10 year old daughter. Assembly was easy with the provided tools. The scooter goes well on grass or pavement. The speed seems just right for her age. The plastic parts seem a flimsy or I would give 5 stars.
5,Hilarious,"This is not only only one of the best comedies I've seen, but one of the best movies in general. It's one of those movies where you can watch it for the fifteenth time and still laugh as hard as you did the first time."
4,Funny film-POOR 1ST DVD PACKAGE THOUGH,"I have always thought this film was very funny. Basically the end of Jamie Lee Curtis & Kevin Kline's careers. NEVER had another hit film either of them.This is a film that needed an updated DVD package. No extras at all. Won an Oscar for Kline & was a hit but this package has NO extras. Glad a n updated DVD package is always available.""Don't call me stupid"".My rating is for the film not for the bare nothing special DVD package.Extras, where are the extras?I never liked Palin's character Ken.Does have both wide screen & stand versions of the film depending on what you prefer.Does have a good brochure with film information plus chapter search list."
2,Don`t Call This Fish a Classic,"Despite a couple of funny scenes (just funny, not really hilarious), this movie is average at best and highly disappointing. Some might say that ""A Fish Called Wanda"" is a masterpiece comedy, but frankly I fail to see what the hype is all about. Sure, there are a couple of quirky moments here, yet the plot is substandart, the directing is weak, the characters are not likable in the least and the acting shows signs of competence still isn`t all that great either. Overall, this effort is a mildly enjoyable cinematic experience that`s probably worth watching once if there`s nothing better around. Decent and tolerable, but a classic this is not.Passable entertainment."
2,Movie great -- Sound just simply awful,"This gut-busting comedy starring Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, John Cleese and Michael Palin deserves better. The DVD has the worst sound I've ever experienced on DVD or VHS. If you're used to 5.1 sound, mono just doesn't cut it. It's one of my favorite comedies, and maybe my most disappointing DVD."
3,Great movie - disappointing DVD release,"Given that ""Wanda"" is way up there in my personal ""Top 25"" list, I eagerly anticipated its release on DVD and picked it up as soon as the opportunity presented itself.Unfortunately, I'm rather disappointed in the DVD version. Were there no deleted scenes or outtakes that could've been added? Was there no behind-the-scenes documentary footage to show us? Could Michael Palin and/or John Cleese not be persuaded to add any commentary to one of the audio tracks? And speaking of the audio - why on Earth is the soundtrack in MONO??!? When I saw that on the box, I thought that _had_ to be a misprint - but no, the soundtrack is indeed in bloody single-channel monophonic.Sorry, MGM - you blew it with this one."
4,A Fish Called MGM,"First, let me agree with others: this is a ""bare bones"" DVD with marginal sound, so-so visuals and virtually no special features. Write your concerns to MGM.Well, I guess that leaves the ""content"" and (sorry to say?) it's well worth it.You get, for your money, some of the best comedic performances from some of the most gifted comic actors of the last century. John Cleese is perfectly cast as a proper Brit who get sucked into Kevin Kline's impulse management issues. If British people are represented by Cleese and Americans by Kline, here are some conclusions:1. Cleese and Kline - make a great law firm??2. Brits are really staightlaced but quite sexy.3. Americans are completely unhinged, but effective.4. Neither seem to have much regard for animal rights.5. But, we're assured, none were harmed in the making of...6. Brits use steamrollers well.7. Jamie Leigh Curtis looked awesome.Yeah, the last one is shallow, but man, is it true..."
3,glimpses of greatness,"This cd leaves me a bit frustrated, as I can't seem to enjoy it from start to finish. Like many of you, I also long for the early Todd sound (though I count ""nearly human"" of more recent vintage as his latest greatest)and don't particularly enjoy Todd's social commentary on songs such as ""happy anniversary."" Having said that, I found my new favorite Todd song on this disc; namely, ""Past."" It stands up against the best of Todd, and I found a few other memorable tunes on this disc, and I think you will too."
2,"Lazy, Insecure and Bored","hey Todd, I am a HUGE fan. I remember the standing ovation mid set at the Concord Pavilion for Utopia's rendition of Mated...your a hero to me...but if you don't care anymore, why should I? As a fellow musician, composer and producer, this record is just lazy...it also smacks of neurotic self pity...lame social commentary....give me a break, your a cult hero, what muso wouldn't sell his mother for that? How about getting back to what you do best? all this computer music is quantized BS and is making me barf and it should you too...stop fooling yourself that you are 'moving forward' do what you do best, and give the rest, a rest...thanks for listening...if you want me to, how about some real drums, a real band? A real ballaad I can listen to a 1000 times?"
2,?????,"I am disappointed by this album. I've tried listeningto it several times but it just doesn't get into mysystem the way that several of his older albums (Accapella,Human Nature, No World Order, A True Wizard, etc). Liarsstarts out strong with Truth, Happy Aniversary, and thecharming Soul Brother. But after Future, things get melodicallyboring and not very interesting lyrically. Things do pick uptoward the latter half but just barely. This collection forme is very uneven."
2,Resets constantly,"Features and price are excellent, but the battery doesn't make good contact, so the units keeps reseting; which is really annoying, since you have to program all the information again (wheel size, time, etc.)."
1,Poor Janacek,"Though I remain neutral towards the rest of the material on the CD, the performance and interpretation of Janacek's string quartet I found to be exceptionally poor. The performance seemed to lack both the technical and emotional aspects of the work; the players often seeming to on the verge of losing hold of these admittedly demanding works. I would highly recommend the Hagen Quartet's interpretation of the two string quartets and urge anyone interested in the work of Leos Janacek, at the very least, to simply look and listen elsewhere."
1,Duped and Disappointed,"This item is nothing like the picture shown. Looks more like the $10.00 one. Also thought it came with two, as my car has two doors. It's like ordering floor mats and getting one mat for one side; makes no sense to me. I can't believe I paid $29.50 for one handle and some useless garment strap for the back."
1,seriously disappointed,Received the package to find only half of what i was expecting to get. Nothing tells you theres only one handle in the supposed kit. Bunk!!! After market is a better value.
2,Nothing new,"I must agree with Elizabeth; there is nothing in this book that a casual search on the internet couldn't find. As for the other two who gave the book a five star rating, they (for some strange $reason$) give five stars to everything they review."
4,Good enough for me,"too much English but for a beginner like me without any proper class or instruction, it's a fair start. Adequate enough to learn on the go."
3,Questions,"The pronunciation section is great, the exercises aren't bad, and the advice given seems practical and clear and generally decent. The stories aren't that great, but the narrative format and practice sentences seem to help me remember vocabulary pretty well."
4,There are no bad boys,"Old fashion story of a tough kid with a soft heart who finds it with the right type of guidance. A classic story of right from wrong, repentence and redemption."
4,fantasy,Lovely concept and refreshingly different from her other series. Nice system of magic incorporated into a whole new world. You can see a lot of thought went into this new series. You'll love it.
3,Vintage 1980's,"If you are into 1980's pop/obscure new wave music, these guys are your style. I liked it well enough."
5,enjoyed this,excellent story. this book made a big impression on me. one of the best books i have read in quite a while.
2,"Way too expensive, not much special about it.","The steel is the same un-named stuff Schrade uses for most of their knives. It's not really bad, but only a good steel when you take into account the price of their cheaper knives. For the amount this knife sells for, it should be better.The location of the lock is about as bad as it gets. As you can see in the picture, the area you have to push to realease it is not convenient to access with one hand, while at the same time it appears to be in a bad location for accidental closing."
2,"Good for the Earth, but not so tough on Scum","I bought this product to do my part with the environmental craze. I like using it around my daughter, as it has no harsh fumes, and the scent is very nice. I like to clean the tub before giving her a bath in the bath/shower that her father and I use everyday. When I use this product frequently (like every-other day or so,) it does a fine job. But if I haven't cleaned the tub in over a week, it doesn't quite cut through the soap scum. I end up using the scrubbing bubbles, and having to have the vent on in the bathroom to get rid of the fumes before I dare to take my little girl in the room.I would say that this product is good for light cleaning, or a single person, but it isn't up to the task of heavier jobs, or multiple-person families."
4,IT MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND......,"What is it they say about love? A better question might be what don't they say about love? It makes the world go round. What the world needs now is more of it. It's a many splendored thing. A moments madness. The list goes on and on. .Little wonder it's also the inspiration for a bold, seductive new fragrance from Cacharel.It arrives in a brilliant red bottle, the color of a heart, the shade of passion. Amor Amor is both romantic and vivacious with top notes of pink grapefruit, blood orange, sweet mandarin and black currant. Heart notes are found in apricot, red rose, jasmine melati flower and lily of the valley.Available in 1 oz, 1.7 oz. and 3.4 oz. sprays, it promises to be a highly coveted fragrance at an affordable price.- Gail Cooke"
4,Dated but still very good.,"After reading about 6-7 other books on home brewing, I kept hearing everyone say that this book is the ""bible for home brewers"", so I had to buy it. I just got done reading through the whole book and am satisfied with it. It has all the basic information any home brewer can use, from beginner to advanced brewers. Charlie Papazian has a way of informing you of basic and advanced methods while keeping it simple. I highly recommend this book for any level of brewer, but especially beginners."
5,Excellent read - both informal and entertaining,"I went into this book as a complete beginner, and it has introduced me to a whole new world. I now have an extensive homebrew setup, and am in the midst of 10 gallons of my own homemade beer. I highly recommend this book to anyone just starting out in the homebrew world as it has all of the information to take you exactly as far as you want to go without being overwhelming in the least."
5,Great book.,"Very informative from beginner to expert. Includes recipes. Easy to read, follow, and understand. A must have book for the home brewer. Even goes in to making mead and melomel. Includes some history as well."
2,"No page numbers, info on cold crashing?","I generally have found this book to be poor. The whole reason for buying the electronic edition was to make things easy to find, and that feature works ok. Quirks of the soft-copy edition, however, include the fact that the page numbers cited in the glossary are useless because there are no page numbers.Additionally, if you want information on something pretty routine in homebrewing called ""cold crashing"", there is none. No mention of it at all. Generally, a substandard book that I wish I had not paid money for."
1,Moto Washer that Self Locks!!!!,"I received my MW a few months back...today I got to use it for the first time. It is super on the roof of my van - in the unlocked position as they say in the directions. This allows the head to move freely....for awhile!!!! About 20 minutes in, it locked up as though it were in position A or B and will not come out. I really like the brush operation portion....but the lock up - another story. The price shown is good...I paid more - and now it shows ""discontinued."" Recommend getting the bigger model - but then the head looks the same. Back to the old fashioned way."
2,"Rainbow Slips a Notch on ""Stranger""","Ritchie Blackmore's guitar playing is consistently top-notch on this album; unfortunately, little else about the album is. Where did Blackmore find these guys? The lyrics are childish, the vocals amatuerish, the drumming high-schoolish (I cringed when I heard the overly busy drumming in ""Still I'm Sad"" which ruins a potentially decent song). The opening cut, ""Wolf to the Moon"", ranks right up there with the best Rainbow songs ever. The rest of the album has some moments, due to Blackmore's playing, but is pretty much forgettable. It sounds like a highly polished professional guitar player playing with a high school band."
4,Memories of a great gig,This is a strange assortment of the artists that were on the Stiff records label in 1977. I saw this tour and the CD brings it all back. There are a number of highlights - I like Wreckless in particular - but the outstanding track is Elvis Costello singing I Don't Know what to do With myself. If you remember the late seventies you must buy this.
2,NOT GOLD CONTACTS,"The contacts are standard metal (silver-tin type), not gold. Not pretty.The image is not of the product and constitutes false or misleading advertising."
2,Not really worth the effort,"To be fair, the product does not claim to be an air conditioner. However, it does claim to cool 12 degrees cooler, which I didn't find at all. I live in a dry Colorado climate, and still it is barely cooler than a fan. You have to fill it with tons of ice to even get that, and it requires refilling with water and ice often. If you don't clean it at least once a week, it starts smelling really bad.All this effort of refilling and cleaning is not worth the 3 to 5 degrees cooler you get. For that, I'd rather just plug in a fan and not have to worry about it every day. Save your money and buy a portable air conditioner. It's worth the extra investment, trust me."
4,good working fan with evaporating funcation,It is a good fan with evaporating function to cool you a bit more. I like it has an Ionizer with it to fresh air. It's better than just a fan. But the fan came in with a crack on the one corner that making a noise when using swing function only found it after a week. It makes this fan only down sides part.
5,Outstanding work by favorite duo,I absolutely loved this CD. Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnel are amazing.I admire their committment and dedication to the integrity of their craft.Hour Glass is superb from the first song to the last bathing the listener in gentle articulate lyrics and soothing melodic sounds.Hourglass is as refreshing as a candlelit bubble bath.I put on this CD when I want to escape the world and from the first note to the last the stress rolls off my body and my mind becomes clear and tranquil.I also highly reccomend America's Human Nature CD.
2,Not the best sound quality...,"I was disappointed with the overall quality of this cd. I have always enjoyed Mason Williams but this cd doesn't do him justice. The recording quality is poor and the sound produced is very ""tinny"". It sounded too much like listening to an old transistor radio. Classical Gas itself was a big disappointment. The older recordings of this were less synthesized and had more of Williams' superb playing style. It is such a great piece and this cd didn't give it the right attention. You really would do better to look for a different cd; something else with better sound quality!"
4,measure twice cut once,"Is very sturdy and quite accurate, alittle larger than I expected and heavier,easy to read screen. Very pleased"
3,Caliper,Didn't last too long. Dropped something on it right after getting it and the viewing window cracked. Our fault. It's ok for the money
2,"Caliper works fine, Amazon sent me a broken case","Caliper works fine, Amazon sent me a broken case.The case is very cheap plastic and Amazon did not pack it properly, there were shards of sharp plastic that I could have easily cut or punctured my hand with.Amazon this is UNACCEPTABLE. It is dangerous to ship this way or in such a manner as to allow this to happen in transit.The packaging was THIN.Poor poor effort.The only positive is that the caliper seems to work ok. It needs constant reset to zero but other than that it is a decent caliper."
1,Absolutely avoid,"Totally bogus set of calipers. If it isn't having power management issues, the scale isn't reacting. It's just one thing after another. Worst money I've ever spent."
3,Absolute junk,"I understand that this is an inexpensive tool, but really, at least the measurements should regularly increase as the jaws widen. Just going up and down the slider smoothly, the numbers jump all over the place.This is a piece of trash, and not even worth the $15 or whatever it was.--------------Edit: I bought another one, returned the old one, and it works much better. I must have just had a bad one. If you get a good one it's certainly worth the price."
1,Never worked,Gave it as a gift at Christmas. They took it out of the box and it did not work. Tried to use troubleshooting instructions and nothing worked. I am returning the product and purchasing a different product.
4,GOOD PRODUCT,Delivey is quick and happy to receive in 3 days. digital calipers is working fine. Only problem is I did not found logo of NEIKO on the digital calipers. Because it is trust and confedent for NEIKO brands.
5,Great product for the price,"Good quality, repeatable, came with a battery and a spare, works great each and every time I use it. Recommended."
3,case is a cheap plastic and one end is broken off. could only get refund and then reorder..........more chinese cheap plastic,see above calipers seem fine good design. had to measure three rifle parts to order. we will see if order turns out
1,or no stars.. but I was hopeful,"I really tried to like this new micrometer. Looks good, decent packaging but when it comes down to it - what good is a micrometer if it doesn't measure accurately? At first, I got the measurement I expected from a known item. Let's say for the sake of example it is 1.70 inches. Every time subsequent to the measure I'd get a +.2 - even after resetting to zero and turning on, then off and resetting - whatever it took - but to no avail - 1.9 - every time. I could always add the difference - but what's the sense right? Sorry Neiko - get it right or stay out of the measurement business."
3,Good enough for my needs,Seems to work well enough for my needs. So far it stays in calibration when compared to my analog unit. I wouldn't use it for critical measuring. But for reloaders and hobbyists it should satisfy your needs.
1,Broke after 2 weeks,"Worked great for about 2 weeks then the LCD went bad. It's unable to take a measurement because the display shows random values, does not zero and doesn't turn off. The only way to turn it off is by removing the battery but since it's broke I don't care. It's not worth the time or money to return for a replacement. Go buy one from Lowes."
2,there ok,there ok but they are to cheap to use at work where they use mitutoyo digital caliper made in japan not china.the digital caliper are NOT ISO calibration and certificated. not coolant poof.box show mitutoyo digital caliper when thay are not mitutoyo digital calipers!!
2,you get what you pay for,"seems real cheap and flimsy. i could not get it to read, followed the problem solving instructions and it still would read. screen just says 0.000"
4,excellent for a college student,for the price it's amazing.it feels cheap though on the other hand it's accurate.I bought it to use it in a engineering graphics class and i hope it does the job though it feel like it's going to break by the end of the semester .
5,Nice tool,"When I first saw the Neiko SS 6-Inch Digital Caliper I was immediately impressed by its appearance and after using it for several months I can state that it is accurate, easy to use, and sturdy. The hard case that comes with it keeps it from being damaged when the caliper is not in use."
5,Amazingly accurate amazing price,Hard to believe that this kind of accuracy can be achieved for such a low price. Highly recommend this tool.
5,Great tool and accurate.,This is great. It has been very useful and i plan to purchase the same one if i ever need another one.
3,Okay Wig,"This was shipped in a timely manner. The buns did not sit as low as they show in the photo and the quality was not the best, but it is a decent wig for the price."
1,Very disappointing,"Poetry that glorifies infidelity-- this book would be totally devastating to anyone who has been betrayed. It can even provide an incentive for a spouse who is considering an affair to follow through on it. It's a very destructive, sick book."
3,EROTIC FLUFF!,Three very erotic and sensual stories but not much room for character or plot development.
4,...and the truth shall set you free...,"In the interest of brevity: what a wonderful book. As Carl Sagan said, ""The well-meaning contention that all ideas have equal merit seems to me little different from the disastrous contention that no ideas have any merit."""
5,"Finally, a hammer to replace my old Bluegrass framing hammer","I've used a 20 oz. Belknap Bluegrass framing hammer for 25+ years but have been unable to find an octagon replacement handle like the original. I've tried a few different brands of hammers to replace it but have been disappointed.I recently purchased a Douglas 20 oz. framing hammer and am amazed. Great balance and feel. I won't miss my Bluegrass 20 oz. any more, though I still use my 16 oz. for finish work, siding, etc.I can't recommend the Douglas framing hammer enough... Great hammer, worth every penny.Kim T. Hayfield"
4,Fast paced read as usual,"Once again Robb has delivered a fast paced and entertaining book. The style of this book was a little different than from the previous mysteries, because you know who is doing it, but it was still great to read and follow the developments throughout the book. It's been so great watching the characters & relationships develop throughout the series, Eve has grown so much emotionally throughout the series, and in each book we get to know all the characters better, which makes the stories that much more enjoyable. Peabody & McNab's story continues, as well a story line for Charles Monroe (our favorite LC from previous books).I can't believe this is the 13th installment already, the stories are still fresh. I definitely recommend you pick this one up, the series is still going strong."
1,Lack of turns and twists,"This book is not as good as the other JD Robb's books. I'm very disappointed. no surprise ending. Lack of turns, twists, and spices. it's too bad, I love JD Robb's previous works."
1,NOW MADE IN CHINA!!,NEED I SAY MORE! come on guys how hard is it to make this here. This is not sink or swim Its just american greed! Dont give me the govenment regulations b.s go back to your roots ! Estwing and Vaughn/Dalluge can make it here.
3,Great until the claw broke,"I bought my 18 oz Douglas hammer a few years ago and have enjoyed its clean elegant design until two days ago when I broke one of the claws off while attempting to pull a nail. I am a 61 year old light user and have never broken a hammer claw in my life before this time. I emailed the company two days ago with my sad story. To be fair there is only a two year warranty offered on the Douglas web site and my hammer is most likely older than this, however I was surprised to not receive any response to my email. I am thinking I may have to go back to the reliable Estwing brand which I know can take a licking and keep on hitting."
2,Disappointing,"Bought this for the NYPD Blue theme after listening to several MP3 versions that didn't sound the same. Unfortunately, the theme on the disk also doesn't sound exactly like the one at the start of the show. It is close, so kept listening hopefully. Then to my dismay, started hearing vocals that aren't heard on the TV version. Don't know if the TV version is abbreviated or if the vocals were added for the CD, but they really detract from the main theme [IMO]. Since this specific track was the reason I bought the disk, it is a big disappointment."
1,this book is evil,"Please read this book before letting your children read it and then you decide whether it is acceptable for children to learn how to summon demons and keep a door open to those in the underworld. If you can only read the last chapter, it pretty much tells Mr. Pullman's goal in this trilogy. He wants our impressionable children to know that witchcraftery is good, and that they should also keep their powers a secret from others. He also states on the last page that Heaven is not a place to live for but that they can finally just live for today (the here and now). I only rated it one star because I had to, to submit a rating."
4,The Amber Spyglass,This was the third in the trilogy and I felt a little let-down. Maybe because the characters were just too stereotypical - but it is a fantasy after all so I guess I should be satisfied with the happy ending.
5,"The Best Book I ever read, hands down!","This book is amazing and twice as good as any harry potter book. The tons of plot twists and wonderful characters bring this book to life. It's much more intense and detailed than most other fantasy books I've read. The ending brought me to tears. I recommend it for older readers, probably above 12. You won't be disappointed!"
3,It was alright... not as good as I expected,"Hello I'm 12 years old and in 7th gradeIn most trilogies or series, you expect the last book to be the best. Well, this was a little bit dissappointing. It dragged on, expecially with the Dr. Malone and the malufa parts, and somethings seemed downright unnecessary. I enjoy writing myself, and read many books to get ideas of good writing techniques and stuff, and it was actually a friend who reccomended this to me (excuse any spelling mistakes). It had a beautiful ending, with passion, love, and dissapointment that nearly made me cry, but the long wait to get to that part was almost not worth it. 3 whole books for that! I didn't like the series over all, actually, it was just... boring. The thing that kept me going was the daemons, they were pretty awesome alright! You had to fall to like Pan and Lyra, they were a great team, total opposites, but bound together nontheless. Well, thats my review thanks for reading everybody!!!"
4,The Amber Spyglass,"No matter what anyone says, this book is amazing! It's a great story with an impeccable plot, as well as enchanting characters. It's pretty much worth what you pay. However, from a religious point of view, this book might be very offending for you, especially if you can't distinguish fact from fiction. If you look deeper, this book doesn't necessarily express the author's opinion."
3,"Thrilling, the best one yet!","I started reading the series,""His Dark Materials"", this summer. I was hooked after the first chapter. I read the first book in two days, ""The Golden Compass"", and the second book, ""The Subte Knife"", also in two days. I was very anxious for the third book to come out, so to take my mind off it I tried to read Anna Karinin, I didn't get too far before ""The Amber Spyglass"" was out. I didn't put it down until I finished it. I don't recommend reading this book if you are a very religious person, dedicated to God. Also you really need to read the first two before reading this one, or you'll be totally lost!"
1,Major Disappointment,It seems like there is no middle ground. People either loved or hated this book. I am in the latter camp. If only Mr. Pullman had stopped at Book II.
2,Pullman is the Anti-Lewis...,"...he really is. I'm sure C. S. Lewis would be grieved beyond belief to read these books. They are fairly well written (dispite some pretty obvious plot-holes). I really like how he uses the idea of ""daemons."" However, there is no way I would recommend this trilogy to any of my students - they're definately not childrens' books. Pullman seems to have a huge axe to grind against the Catholic church, and this might offend some people greatly. However, if sloppy theology doesn't bother you, you might like these books."
5,If only I could give 6 stars,"Let me begin by saying that this is the second best book i've ever read. Yes, the second, after book one of the series, The Golden Compass. This book is truly amazing. It was breathtaking how Phillip Pullman could have such small and quiet beauty (the mulefa scenes) and such astounding grandeur (the war with heaven, the land of the dead.) and both be so compelling and interesting. I'll keep this review short because all you really need to know is that missing out on this book is a horrible mistake.P.S. Before reading this book you should know two things: You really must read The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife to understand what goes on here, AND if you are offended by strong religious themes and story elements, you should probably not read this book."
5,"An Exquisite, and Profoundly told, Story","The Golden Compass, and its 2 sequels (The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass) is a story featuring profound concepts, displaying the most original creativity in characters & and in plot, and a ""can't put it down"" story line, that can be understood and appreciated by people of all ages. I am reading all three for the 2nd time, and I have enjoyed it more even than the first read through. I am a youthful 72 year old, and I would recommend this Trilogy to anyone I am related to, regardless of age. I also these books would inspire new writers."
5,Very Unusual,"Weired... interesting..but very powerful. I believe this is one of those books that made me not only think, but also regret that i dont have to think about anything anymore. The end was unexpected, maybe this is why it was so good. It wasnt a typical end, and that is what gave this book a different note. To read three long books and to be dissapointed is not right, and these books are not for any taste; but if you happen to get interested in them, I garantee you an unique and amazing experience."
1,(...),"The series began well inviting me into a world of intrigue and fantasy, always dangling a new question ahead, tempting one further down the path. Unfortunately the final volumne, The Amber Spyglass, rattles and clunks it's way downward losing parts and pieces along the road of fantasy as if the author had created such just to bring one to a rude awakening. It arrives naked at it's final destination stripped bare of any redeeming plot or even the pretense of assuming one. It is unendurable as the book becomes a pulpit from which the author delivers his own accumulated personal payload of adolescent bile and political/religious babble. One can hear him saying ""Forget the book, now that I have you this far, this is what I really wanted to say."" It's like watching the window roll down as the car rolls to a stop and the gentleman inside does his sweetly perverted best to lure children within reach of his dark and subtle grasp. This isn't a children's fantasy trilogy. It's literary molestation."
3,"Sorry, Charlie","One of the best books I've ever read was The Golden Compass. The Subtle knife was in the favorites, too. However, the third book wasn't even close to it. Although it did played up to my expectations since it wasn't that high. I wasn't looking foward to it but had to read it since I wanted to find out what happened. Well, now I know, and I won't read it again and again like other books I have. I'll still recommend it for people who are crazy about his books. But, just don't have high expectations for it. Good book, not great."
5,Excellent,"Like Rowling's Goblet of Fire, there were definitely parts of the book that could have been omitted that would have made the story move along faster...But Pullman's expert writing is not something that you want to be over soon...Pullman, more so in Amber Spyglass than either of the first two books (which are amazing), exhibits a mastery of the writing and storytelling crafts.....A reader cannot help but BE with Lyra and Will and physically FEEL the full range of emotions that these two children on the brink of young adulthood go through from beginning to end of Amber Spyglass."
5,Magnificent Ending to a GroundBreaking Trilogy,"The Amber Spyglass in my opinion was better than the first two books combined!! And to all those people who think Pullman is attacking God and Christianity let me corrrect you. He said in an interview that The Authority (presumably God) is not the Christian God. The Authority, Pullman said, is the god that all the murderers and terrorists blames on the things they do. Pullman said that if there really was a God who told people to kill and do things like 9/11 he should be overthrown. So as you see he is in no way attacking the Christian Faith. BUY THIS BOOK!!!!"
2,major disappointment,"I loved The Golden Compass and loved The Subtle Knife even more. I reserved a copy of this book before it was released and bought it in hardcover. And I couldn't give a hoot about the anti-Christian message.But Philip Pullman sure got himself in a tangle in this one. The ending was contrived, confusing, and needlessly tragic -- as if he felt that he needed a tragic ending, so he contorted his world until it became inevitable. And there were so many philosophical and religious allegories that it seemed the author lost track of them almost as much as I did. Because I'm totally susceptible to having my strings pulled, I sobbed for hours when I finished it, but when I dried my tears I was MAD, MAD, MAD."
2,He should have stopped after two...,"It's really a shame that Philip Pullman had to throw in all sorts of bizarre pseudo-religious mumbo jumbo into this book (The new Adam and Eve, the new serpant, assassin priests, etc.). I mean REALLY! The plots of the first two books in the series were extremely well written and engaging. However, this book (what should have been the climax of the two prior ones leading up to it) instead took a wild swerve and became nothing more than a vehicle for Mr. Pullman to vent some wacked out religious views."
2,Not Uplifting but rather lacking in hope,"I'm sorry but to all of those who say that one is close-minded to say this book is evil have never believed in anything good. I love harry potter and laugh at those who scorn it for evil because Harry Potter is on the good side whereas Lyra never knows which side she is on. Yes, that may be human but this dehumanizes hope for a higher power (God, Buddha, Christ, Nature, Whoever) that guides us in goodness. I especially disagree that because things are done in God's or the Authorities Name that they be God's wishes. Almost every war is over religion and yet that doesn't mean God is leading either side. We are humans and do what we want to be right and Pullman is saying that we do what the Authority wants which isn't always the case. I started out loving Lyra and Will and now i feel cheated that they lead me to fight what is the truth."
4,could be better...but not by much,"I'm not going to go into one of those agonizingly long disscussions about how he was ""offending"" god and all, I mean it's jsut fiction right? Anyways what I liked about these books was he didn't make everything ""happy"" or too use a cliche, he didn't sugar coat anything. He wasn't afriad to kill off characters or introduce some darkness. He realized that not every story has a compleatly happy ending."
5,"absitively,posolutly,splendirifous","I absolutly loved this book,though i thing that the 1st one was the best. Definitly worth the long wait!!!I fell in love with this book! But for all you people who feels it is offensful to your religion, IT'S JUST A BOOK!! it's not telling you to go out and do anything!"
2,great book... until the last couple pages,"I loved the first two books in this trilogy, The Amber Spyglass was going great too, i loved it, until i read the last chapter. Words can't explain my dissapointment at the ending, everything i was anticipating happened, and then went down the toilet when i read the ending. Overall i was dissapointed with this book, though it was very good until the last chapter."
4,Definitely a little disappointing,"This book was almost as good as The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife, but I was disappointed by a number of things. For one thing, the villain, Mrs. Coulter, who practically gave me nightmares in the first two books, didn't seem villainous in the least! And Pantalaimon and Lyra didn't really seem at all close after they had been seperated. I had enjoyed reading about how they were connected to each other. And most of all, I hated the ending. It made it seem as though nothing had happened at all, plus it was so sad for both Lyra and Will. But this is still a very good book. It had a good plot with twists and turns that put me on the edge of my seat with suspense."
1,What a cop-out!!,"I truly loved the first two books in this series and also was quite taken with this one until the last few chapters.Pullman then seemed to completely switch books. Some of the most interesting characters completely changed personalities with no apparent motivation or explanation. It was as if he couldn't figure out how to resolve all the various ideas, so he just took the easiest possible way out and quit writing. Perhaps he was getting pressure from his publisher to hurry it up.If he couldn't figure out a reasonable denoument, I would much rather he have continued the story into a fourth volume than wrap it up the way he did.I doubt I'll be buying any more of his books."
5,One of the greatest written of our time,"This surely is one of the greatest fantasy books of all time. The way Pullman mixes it up with the 2 prequels will leave you amazed and gratefull that he ever took the time to write it.The only thing is, you must read the two books before it too fully understand it and get the full amazement, so read them FIRST!"
1,So Disappointing,"This is a book that has some truly wonderful moments, but to end this wonderful trilogy like this, is a tragedy. I would never recommend this series again, simply because the ending is so awful. The last third of the book almost made me cry because it dropped the ball on so many levels. If you've read the first two, stop there, it will just disappoint you."
5,A good review,The amber spyglass is an amazingly emotional book. U get sooooo involved and U really feel for all the things that happen to the main characters Lyra and Will U wont understand what i'm on about unless youve read the first 2By Tom Gillingham
4,The best wax for my legs!,My legs became smooth easily with this wax. But I always fail when I try with underarm and bikini line.
2,Works OK but a pain to clean up,"This is probably the worst wax I have tried. It does remove most of the hair, but it is impossible to get off of your skin! The supplied oil helps some, but it's still a pain. Don't try with cloth strips as it won't rinse off the strips and will clog your drain! There are MUCH better waxes out there. My favorite is NadsNad's No-Heat Hair Removal Gel, 6 oz (170 g)or Sally Hansen honey wax using CLOTH STRIPS (not supplied in the kit)Naturally Bare Honey Wax Hair Remover for Body Wax Women by Sally Hansen, 1 Count. Tip: If you buy Sally Hansen wax in the store, there is usually a coupon included inside the box."
1,A painful mess,"This wax is a painful sticky mess that rips off skin. I thought my technique was off, so I bought some hot wax because I could not stand having one waxed armpit because this wax ripped the skin off and it was too painful to continue. Needless to say the hot wax (strip free) was AMAZING! I have one raw red armpit (from this product) and one baby smooth irritation free armpit (from the hot wax). Buy strip free hot wax!!"
1,I would give this product 0 stars if I could!,"I've been using wax hair removal products for years. I've used Nads and other cold wax products similar to that. I've used a few hot wax products as well, and I have to say that this one is by far the worst one ever!I have found that most of the hot waxes are made to rinse off with soap and warm water. So, if you get any on your counter top or floor its no big deal. But, this product only comes off with the oil that comes in the box. Even then, you still have to scrape and scrub to get all the wax off. And, depending on where its spilled you may be left with a stain.The bottom line is, this product is way more trouble than its worth, especially since its about the same price as the other hot waxes out there, and it seems to have the same results. If you want a hot wax don't buy this one!"
1,"Sticky, terrible mess.","I bought this after using Sally Hansen's Warm Wax (with Peach Extracts) product thinking that it would be similar... it's NOT. This stuff is like using purple tar to wax with and takes a dozen or more cotton wipes soaked in cooking oil to remove. It tore my skin and took over 10 minutes to take off (having to rub my poor skin over and over with the wipes to do it). It stick to the floor, it sticks to the tub, it sticks to the bottle, it sticks to everything. Do NOT buy this product. Effective, yes, but not worth the pain and mess!!"
2,Love stories.... not really.,"When I picked up my copy of Best Gay Love Stories I never expected to many of the stories to be completely depressing. While all the stories do deal with love in one form or another, most of them have a saddness about them and most don't end on a positive note.All the stories are well written and interesting but I would hardly call this a collection of love stories."
1,In remembrence of Billy,"I bought this book for my special friend Billy a couples of months ago, and although he was is the terminal stage of his battle against aids (aids won) hie enjoyed it thouroughly. Recomended to all gays like Billy."
5,"A ""Grade A"" CD","I have a couple of other Mannheim Steamroller CDs, so I figure I would get this one since many fans say this is their best work. The songs that stand out to me are Deck The Halls, Good King Wenceslas, the upbeat God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen and Stille Nacht. If this disc doesn't put you in the holiday mood, nothing will. Get it if you don't have it!"
2,"Frankly, only one great song - Stille Nacht","Out of the 11 tracks - you will have to decide for yourself if the purchase is worth the one great track - # 13 - Stille Nacht. Most all of the other tracks sounds like a Grade 9 student's 1980 synthesizer project. Yuck. I suggest passing by this one, yet try to find this (Track 11) ""Stille Nacht"" elsewhere by alternate means..."
1,Christmas music at its worst,"This cliche elevator muzak was trite at its 1990 release. Go for Elvis or Liberace Christmas music. There's another reason why Christmas music is only played everywhere during December, I mean November. This music is cheese, it is saccharine, it is just as bad as Siberian Orchestra!"
2,COULDNT USE IT,VCR/DVD DOESNT WORK ON VHS ANYMORE....SO I CANT USE IT.SORRYDONT HAVE THE RETURN LABEL TO GET MY MONEY BACK.
1,Overpriced replacement parts and additional purchasing fees,"Don't buy this sprayer unless you must have the 150 lb. feature!I have owned a SP sprayer for two years. I have used it to spray roundup. It clogged and I took it apart to repair it. When I put it back together it would not build up pressure and did not work. I purchased new replacement parts. The recommended Kit 12 is very expensive. $28.89 for two ""O"" rings and two ""rubber?"" washers. Despite the overpriced replacement parts cost SP also charged a $1.31 Materials Handling Fee and a $5.00 Warehouse Handling Fee. These fees were not mentioned a the time I placed the telephone order. I am buying a new sprayer from a different company."
2,Poor design compared to other Black&Decker tools,"Vac has very little sucking power compared to the old 14.4V version I have. It is poorly designed for home use - no ""battery charged"" indicator, no attachment tools, no wall mount, have to disconnect battery to charge the vac and reconnect it again when it is charged. Other models you can just leave plugged in so they are always charged. Not sure if this model will keep charge if battery is just left in the vac for couple of weeks without recharging.Provided it can pickup nails as ad shows (which is definitely not the case with my unit), it may work for somebody who has an existing collection of 18V tools in an industrial setting. Returned my the next day."
4,Light as a feather,"I purchased this as my second ice axe after seeking a lighter tool than my Black Diamond Raven for light mountaineering and scrambling in the Cascades.Pros:-Very light weight- the aluminum construction is light enough that I always bring my axe on my trips `just in case' it's needed-Sharp pick (with a small protective cover included)-Perfectly capable as a primary axe for all mountaineering destinations in the Lower 48 statesCons:-No spike. Instead, the shaft is cut at an angle to provide a pointed end, but it can become a snow trap and cannot easily penetrate hard ice.-The adze is rounded which makes chopping ice more difficult-Less comfortable for holding between fingers than the Black Diamon Ravens-The lightweight nature requires extra care when using the axe as an anchor or self arrest.Overall, this is a solid axe if you're primarily optimizing for weight."
1,"Not Working, Not Worth It","This MAP sensor did not bring any improvement to my idling but was a little worst, and it did not come with an o-ring of which I had to buy separately. I ended up using my old MAP sensor instead. It turned out that my old MAP was and still works fine. Don't buy it unless you are absolute that the MAP sensor was the problem."
2,Spongebob hits Rock Bottom!,"THe ONLY GOOD Episode on THIS Dvd is, as ALWAYS, is Mermaid Man & Barnicle Boy IV. ALL the Other shows are AWFUL!!"
2,Not good for chewers.,"One of our two small dogs loves to chew toys (luckily, not anything else), so we've learned to stick with rubber ones that he can't tear apart and pull stuffing out of. I loved the look of this ball and was happy to add a new toy to his bin. Unfortunately, as another customer mentioned, it took our guy less than 5 minutes to pull off and eat about half of the ""land"" sections before we realized what was happening and took it away. I think this would be great for dogs who aren't big chewers, but it definitely didn't work for us."
1,This Sucked,"I read Daniel Clowes ""Pussey"" which I loved but this book is an absolute disjointed, convulted mess that makes no sense whatsoever, it sucks. Really there is no other way to convey this other then ""It Sucks"". The people who praise this book here, scare me and I wonder about their sanity."
2,"Enthusiastic, but not scripturally sound","I'm not a Pentacostal, but I attend a Spirit-filled bible study (which I enjoy) where I was lent this book. The author insists many times that every believer can have all the spiritual gifts, contrary to scripture. He plays fast and loose with his interpretation of scripture. His categorizations of the gifts also seem somewhat arbitrary, and he leaves out gifts such as teaching and apostleship. I'm open to the spiritual gifts continuing today, but it's in spite of Les Sumrall's arguments, not because of them."
2,fine if you think menopause is a disease,"Unless you are very good at separating medical fact from the attitude it is presented in, or are already convinced menopause is a disease, stick to the much more balanced ""The Complete Book of Menopause: Every Woman's Guide to Good Health"" by Carol Landau et al. I intend to. If however, you want to take the approach menopause is an illness and fight it with one form of therapy or other, you will like this one."
5,Mingus in his Prime,"This music stands the test of time. It's not blues-roots Mingus although it bears his prints - the gradual build-up and combining of separate parts into one giant orgasmic release followed by a dreamy afterglow. The pieces are a varied lot around a central impressionistic theme painting the noise, crowds, dust, and smells with Mingus's signature brush strokes. I was ecstatic when I discovered it was back in print. Like some of Miles's early work, it's one of those you play periodically and are always amazed at how fresh and new it still sounds."
2,Predictable and Juvenile,"Lots of sex yes, a plausible story line and interesting dialogue no, lots of eye rolling while reading, definitely."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,I go thtis book hoping to get really informed. I found this book to be confusing and hard to follow. It would be nice if there were picture instead of drawings.
3,lord edgeware,"The beautiful actress Jane Wilkinson made no ecret of the fact that she wanted to exchange her husband for another, still wealthier one. So when he is found murdered, all eyes turn to her, especially since she was seen entering his study only moments before the body was found. She asks famed detective Hercule Poirot to help clear her, buthow can he believe in the innocence of a woman who tried to hire him once before-- to get rid of her husband?"
1,Hogtied,"I haven't finished this yet but it is about the most empty of plot of any book I have read. I knew waaay before lame-brained Jan did that Derek and Andrea were siblings rather than betrothed. She never asked any questions at all and when she did she didn't wait for answers. Like who was Nick, why did Derek know so much about kids needing to learn to walk again and what to do for them. Poor little damsel just kept having problems and the hero would show up to rescue her. Go out riding in the desert without telling anyone, don't take water, doesn't know what time it is, evidently doesn't own a watch, expects her horse to patiently wait for her to wake up. Please!. Was this a first attempt at writing? Pass this one up"
5,great coat,"amazing coat, wind, rain, and cold... HA!!!. order one size bigger though it is tight fitting. cannot recommend enough"
5,Sister Marmalode,"The future of music is here! YEAH!Uaher has over 20 songs on this classic soul album. YEAH! All the songs are emotionally moving and more profound than Miriah Carey's. YEAH! His double-meaning lyrics are steamy. YEAH! Songs 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 are great. YEAH! Songs 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, and 21 are average at best. YEAH!Usher is beautiful. YEAH! His youthful handsome face is intoxicating. YEAH! I love his singing. YEAH! Lil Jon is cute and big. YEAH! I love them both immensely! YEAH! YEAH!"
1,"Let it burn, let it burn","This is one of the worse cd's ever, i am an Usher fan though, but i'm getting tired of him, its like he's running out of ideas, the only songs that are good is when he sings with alicia keys (thats some talent and anyone who sas she is the worst singer is an idiot) also he is acting like micheal jackson when he sings and the way he dances. So don't buy this cd, you should let it burn, literally"
3,Ain't feeling it.......at all.,"I love Usher to death but I ain't feeling this CD. I am very dissapointed that his CD is not what I expected. I have been waiting for Usher to come out with the CD of the year but he shamed me and came out with ""the worst of Usher vol. 1"". There are a few (meaning 3) songs on this CD that are ok. The rest of the CD...ain't all that. Thank God I didn't buy this CD because a burnt copy is all it's worth. Sorry Usher, but you ain't gettin a dime out of me for this one."
1,WHAT HAPPENED?,"I dont understand how this album was so successful because it was pretty bad! I loved the 8701 album...it was a lot more versatile and he portrayed a better range in those songs...now the confessions album is just full of his whiny sexcapades and dumb love songs for his girls...which comes off as narcisstic and just plain old predictable ...there is nothing great about this album...his remake to ""lovers and friends"" was good but why include lil john and ludacris in such a good slow song...yea is the only highlight of the album...everything else is very flat and predicatable R&B....No surprises whatsoever!"
2,Trash!,"This is the absolute worst album that I ever owned! The only songs that I like are his singles, everything else is terrible. Try again, Usher. I had bought this album because I was having complications with one of the mp3s of one of the few songs that I like, but now that it works, it's going on ebay!"
2,Why do they keep doing this?,"What's funny is that Confessions is actually a great album. I listen to it just about everyday. It has a good, smooth r&b; feel to it. Every track has its own individual sound. I love it. But after spending about $16.00 on the original release, why on earth would I go out and buy the same album again just for three extra tracks. It really is pointless if you think about it. It's just a sneaky way for record labels to get more money...and it really urks me. This is why so many teenagers today download music--because of silly BS like this. Seriously. Why would I pay $16 for the same CD twice?But at the same time, if you haven't purchased the original release, I would recommend buying this one instead--because atleast it has a few extra tracks to groove to. But if you already have 1 copy, there's no use in buying this one. The extra tracks really aren't that great to begin with."
3,Not Bad,"I bought all of Usher's 3 cds (My Way , 8701 and now Confessions). I find that Confessions is not as good as the two previous ones. Most of the songs on 8701 had catchy beats and sweet lyrics.In Confessions, you have the hit single ""Yeah!"" and ""Burn"" that are good, the rest is meeeeeh. I'll have to admit that I didn't listened to the cd all that much, but I did go through all the songs.All in all,I bought his cd cause I think he's a great R&B; star."
4,Ya'll say Yeah!!!!,"This album is great! The songs are really good. It is definatly worth your money over! I always listen to this album! The best songs are Yeah, Let it burn, Confessions, and Caught Up!!!!! This album is Da Bomb!!!!!!!!"
3,THE BLACK JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE,"I liked YEAH the first few thousand times I heard it, but now it is soooo played out. It seems like Usher is going to be this milleniums Michael Jackson and this cd will be his ""Thriller"". I'll give him credit he is an amazing performer but these songs are just a little to boring for my tastes. After reading some recent interviews with him (Rolling Stone for one) he seems to be rather arrogant and mouthy. He needs to mellow out and be the the one role model that young African American men can look up to."
5,Bangin' Album,"Yo! I haven't been able to purchase this CD yet due to unemployment and being a fulltime student. But I have sure as hell heard the CD and it is off the banister! I must say that Usher has come up...and surely has come a long way. Give the boy his props, there is no album hotter than this. Janet's Damita Jo is good as well, but if I were to rate them both. Usher would get 5 stars and Janet 4. Yo! As soon as I get $$. This is one investment worth it. I love Usher and I will continue to support him as long as he is around. Hope this review was worth reading."
1,Are kids actually buying this junk?!?!,"This guy is so full of himself its not even funny. His songs suck- their all either mellow and boring (Burn) or annoying and cliched (Yeah). I'm sick of hearing teenagers blasting ""YEAH!"" like its the new ""Stairway To Heaven"". Please stop supporting this junk, he takes his shirt off in every video he makes to attract little teenyboppers who buy his albums."
2,He should have seen a priest!,"What is all the hype about? Although some of the tracks on this CD are radio friendly, it's hardly Usher's best. If you think you are getting a glimpse into the private life of Usher on this album think again, what you got was a nice planned piece of a publicity pie. If on his next album Usher decides to sing about how he lied to sell records in 2004 than that would be true Confession and probably great album...I'd buy 2 copies."
2,"Filled with wicked singles, but rubbish fillers.....","the only reason this album gets two stars is because the 5 singles Usher did release were cool.Yeah! Burn. Confessions. My Boo. and Caught Up are all wicked songs, but the rest of the album is in my opinion weak, and EXTREMELY overrated! there is not really bad songs on here, but very poor for an album that has sold so many! this album does not excite me at all, and thank God i didnt buy it for myself.As for the re=packaging, wot a waste of money and a complete con!Usher has an extremely good voice, and is a wicked dancer. BUT, he is very arragont and up himself which puts me off thinkin he's a cool bloke.NEXT ALBUM please..................!OVERALL- 4/10"
1,a sneaky way to get more money,"I agree w/ another reviewer. I am an Usher fan especially since he's down w/ my boy Michael Jackson. The problem is I bought the first release of this album and now he re-released it w/ 4 extra songs? Thanks a lot Usher, way to screw your loyal fans! My opinion of him has changed because of this move. I'm not gonna waste more money on your updated Confessions."
2,Hype Shall Stop Here,"Okay, enough! Hype stops here! This is not one of the greatest albums of all time...or never will be. People are acting like this is some kind of remarkable historic piece, when it really is a jumbled, rushed, uninspired collection of dull, repetitive and redundant songs!Lord, I don't know where the world will be tomorrow. Maybe if it is heading in this wrong direction, the Cheetah Girls will be hip! Please!Sure, maybe there are some catchy songs...but you don't have to buy filler! Buy the singles for all its worth.Let me note that this is a desperate act for symptathy...he wants us to fell sorry for him cheating on a girl; well dont' feel sorry for him! The woman is going through the pain, and whether the whole cheating incident occured...the whole idea of this album is foolish and sickening."
1,Highly overrated,"Usher is a ok artist dont get me wrong, I think this album is ok but it seriously gets too much praise then it deserves. There are many many more artists who actually work harder and sing better then artists such as usher and get nothing. He basically uses his looks to sell records."
1,"Um,Mark Davis","Um,NOBODY is selling like they used too, if ya haven't noticed already!! Usher is at the peak of his career & I bet he won't be selling like he is now w/ future albums. It happens to ALL artists..so don't make Janet sound like she is flopping when she hasn't came out with a flop album since Control.By the way, you mentioned that the interludes are tired..what a loser.Who in the hell pays attention to interludes,what does that have to do with the content of the album?? Usher's album was built all on HYPE b/c of his single ""Yeah"" and b/c Usher's album has been number 1 for 4 weeks now does not make his album the best cd on that chart. I love Usher & Janet but Janet's cd is good while Usher's is down-right...boring & last minute material. Album sux..you are better off burning a ocpy from your friend.Saves money."
1,"weak, ain't nobody buyin it",don't nobody won't this crap.this is weak stuff the only song i like is yeah cause lil jon was in it and the beat was fresh.usher is weak he need help bad.he need to stuff stealing performance's.cause he is weak.and thats all i got to say.everybody think usher is tight i dont really like usher cause he start cusing . usher ain't the person he use to be.usher need to go to dance class i mean i don't like the way he stole micheal jackson's move he is weak i cant stand back stepping he is a messed up dancer .
4,Good CD!,"I rather enjoyed for the most part the songs I've heard on Confessions. Besides Yeah and Burn I also think Confessions Pt 2, Caught Up, and The Truth Hurts are very good songs. I also like the fact that he has something to say, some substance. If you compare this album to MOST R&B albums or albums in general you have to admit it is a pretty solid album. My only criticism would be that the music and beats tend to sound the same making it seems like you are hearing the same song with a different title at times and that is the only reason I wouldn't give it a 5 star. If you like Confessions then I also recommend the new CD by Janet Jackson, Damita Jo! I did enjoy Confessions but I also think Damita Jo is actually better than Confessions and I have noticed that a lot of the reviewers are also recommending Damita Jo as well."
1,Usher-I Confess This Album Is Horrible,"why do people buy into this garbage,dont get me wrong i like usher but these last two albums seem fake.hes using the same formula all these other talentless cats r using,u know what i mean get a high priced producer,throw in some of the latest trends and you got yourself a hit.this album is a supreme disappointment,it has about 2 or 3 good songs but thats about it,the rest r just fill-ins.DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE"
1,okay then usher what WERE you expecting?,"if this album was selling low numbers, I can understand why it's being rereleased, but this just shows that selling 6 million was not good enough for the dude so he thought he would sell double by releasing this but the result was my booooooooooooo my booooooooooooo my booooooooooooo on the radio all the time and annoying the crap out of me. If he thinks he's gonna get 'thriller' numbers, he is so delusional! Look at how pissed he was for not tying with michael jackson's record of 8 grammies, he should have been thankful for the 3 he got! He may be sexy, but that's where it ends. He used to have good music, but not anymore and this album aint worth my money! Try My Way or 8701 by all means if you must must must have usher in your collection, at least he had good music then."
3,I can't get past track 7...,"it's just too hard to try and listen. ""Confessions"" is NOT Usher's best cd. My Way and 8701 are supreme compared to this. From that awful ""Yeah"" to all the other songs being played on the radio. It's quite sickening, and the overplay just highlights how average this cd is.Also, I don't care if they deny it, I don't believe that this cd is completely separate from Usher and Chili's relationship. Uh Uh. Can't fool me. And this makes the cd very unlistenable. Who wants to hear about their ins and outs? Not me!!!Very average cd. Usher has a nice voice, but he needs to dig a little deeper next time."
3,Usher I Need MORE!!!,"I am not hating on this very talented brother, but I was a little disappointed on this album. If Usher is going to be the next Michael Jackson, his is going to have to bring it all out. Usher is Mike as Kobe is to Jordan.There are some songs that are great: Yeah, Burn, Do it to me, Confessions, and Can U Handle it. But some songs are just throw-ins just to fill the CD.On some songs he is very mature and others are pop NSync like. All in all, great songs, but album doesn't flow well.Usher is good, but to get to the next level he is going to have to do find ONE great producer - like MJ and Quincy Jones did on Thriller. Period."
2,"Where's the Soul Singing, Oops it's Usher","8701 was a much better CD...On this CD he confesses I suppose to his or others relationships, the problem with the CD is although it's personal, I can only listen to 4 songs everything else no matter what he says, I can't stand listening to it. Usher isn't a great singer...It's like having a poem, and you have 2 people reading that poem, well one of the readers will touch the audience while the other will not. Not feeling this CD, the melodies, harmonys and productions are missing"
5,Fire Hunter has always been my favorite book to read,"This book is an action packed story of a cave man struggling to survive in pre-historic times. The main character is also a bit of an inventer who experiments with spear throwers, bow and arrows, taming wild dogs, etc. This book is a must read for young boys and will help addict them to the joys of reading."
2,Not as easy as stated,"The program was not as easy as I thought I would be. I was not able to print working drawings only a list of materials in even tht was only general nothing specific. I was a little disappointed in it's lack of features and difficuty with commands (mostly keyboard and low use of the mouse). For the price fair, but it could have been better."
1,Simplistic and naive!!,"These stories cater to the simple-minded reader. There is absolutely no creative use of language; the writing comes off in a most unnatural manner. Also there is a trite quality to most of the stories. If you love language you will be aghast by this collection. Lahiri is certainly not a writer's writer!! ""There are times I am bewildered by each mile I have traveled, each meal I have eaten, each person I have known, each room in which I have slept."" Does the migrant experience have to be expressed in so banal a manner???"
4,Satisfying,I'm not a fan of short stories in general but the stories in this book are so simply straightforward yet rich in character depth that they offered a very satisfying read. Looking forward to more from this writer!
4,makes you pause and reflect on the immigrant experience,"this book was a joy top read and one of those ones where you dont want the stories to end.. thats what was really good about this book.. while narrating great human stories, it at the same time makes you relate to the immigrant experience... the characters in the stories echo many of your thoughts and feelings.. great read"
2,Disappointed,"The stories are well written and would likely be given an ""A"" in a college composition class but are not the least memorable or even particularly entertaining.I don't understand why this book has gotten so much attention.kate black"
5,Lovely stories,"I'm a fan of Lahiri's and enjoyed Namesake as well. Check it out for yourself and I'm sure you will agree. I too am tired of reading stories of the ""Indianness"" of being Indian. So as an Indian I appreciate this."
3,poolside reading,"Even as an American of Indian bengali descent (like Ms Lahiri), I found it hard identify much with some of her characters - they behaved in such peculiar ways as to stretch credibility. I'll admit the stories did engage me enough to keep reading to the end, but once finished I was disappointed and unsatisfied - left hanging too soon. I'm sure she is better as a novelist as her writing style is very reader friendly."
4,A sense of dislocation,"The characters in Lahiri's collection of stories frequently find themselves suffering a sense of dislocation as they go about their lives along the Eastern seaboard, primarily in university towns. These are Indians of all stations, primarily from Calcutta, who try to find a sense of home as they make curry, paint their hands, struggle through arranged marriages, shop for spices and grocery items to make food that reminds them of Home.These nine stories, full of the colors and sounds, the feel and scent and taste of the world they've left behind, are delicate observations stripped of all nostalgia."
5,beautiful prose,"I was utterly awed by the mastery of language as the written art form, expressing a genuine imitation of Life. Each story is a unique gem, and put together to be savored in this anthology, one can't help but be swept away by the amazing power Lahiri displays over the telling of fictional tales that ring only true in our multifaceted humanity."
4,Short story writing at its best,"Jhumpa Lahiri's collection 'Interpreter of Maladies' was an eye opening experience.The way she paints the environment and nicely weave her story into that, is very interesting.She uses cultural snapshots from the east quite effectively and create unexpected stories from them. The title story keeps one wondering till the very end. Great writing. Many of the stories haunt you much after you finish the book."
3,Too pessimistic about human relationships,"I recently read this book and also Ms. Lahiri's novel ""The Namesake."" She is a wonderful writer. Her stories are interesting and her characters come to life in her beautiful prose. She is also very adept at showing the cultural dilemmas faced by immigrants and their children. But in the end, I felt unsatisfied because she seems to have such a pessimistic view about the relationships between men and women and especially of marriage. It is not that I believe all should be sweetness and light. Life isn't like that. But my own experience also says that there are many long and happy marriages, marriages that give life rather than bleeding it from the protagonists. The instances of hope that came through in the book were overwhelmed by the predominant view that most people are miserable in life and marriage. In the end, the beautiful writing was undermined by the pessimism. I don't think I will read any more of Ms. Lahiri's books."
4,"A brief comment about ""Interpreter of Maladies""","I agree that the stories are beautifully structured, and the language beautiful. The collection of stories does a fine job of making someone think about marriage, love, culture, immigrants, and ultimately life itself. However, I cannot stop thinking that although the prose is stunning, the plot of the stories are fairly simple, and would have been very common had there not been the Indian spice added. In other words, had the stories been about Americans, or Europeans, they would have been too common to be called anything close to a Pulitzer. In any case, Lahiri effectively illustrates the lives of Indian immigrants and natives, busily relating to their surrounding environment."
5,Wonderful Work!,"I wish this were a movie, a tasteful indie with an unknown up and coming cast. Wonderful work - wish I had read it sooner - thank you for writing it!"
2,What's the big fuss about?,"I must say I am taken aback by all the attention this book has been getting. It is a very well written book, but to me its main flaw is precisely that: it is ""well written."" These short stories seem to come out of a creative writing program designed to get you published in magazines like the New Yorker. They are well-constructed but bland. Ms. Lahiri's voice is preppy and impersonal. I recommend the last story, though."
3,Surprising Award-Winner,"After reading five of the nine stories included in this collection I decided not to proceed any further. ""A Temporary Matter"" was very good and worthy of 5*'s, ""When Mr. Pirzada Came to Dine"" had a lot of depth and feeling and was probably worth 4*, but then the book took a turn. The title story ""Interpreter of Maladies"" was mediocre at best and ""Sexy"" fell far short of its name. As I got deeper into the collection all of the stories seemed to blend and become repetitive. Lahiri would probably write a very strong full-length novel, but I wasn't impressed with the short story collection and am very surprised it was honoured with the Pulitzer."
4,interpreter of maladies,I really like the way this lady writes. Conveys meaning and wastes no time. Caring and compassionate.A really enjoyable read!
1,Too Disappointed!,"After reading the positive reviews, I bought this book with too much enthusiam and I feel that was partially a reason for my disappointment. I had way more expectation from this author than what I had to settle with. These are a compilation of short stories that do not leave you satified. I was able to finish the book within a very short time and it left me looking for substance! Being a south-asian, I can relate to some of the stories described but then again there isn't anything to it."
5,Wonderful,"I think the Wall St. Journal review says it best, ""Eloquent....a writer of uncommon sensitivity and restraint."" Jhumpa Lahiri's first book of fiction, a collection of short stories - Interpreter of Maladies has won numerous awards including a Pulitzer prize. For anyone who loves short stories, this is a must read. Lahiri's stories are subtle, haunting, and beautifully written. From the Indian American couple recovering from still birth of their first child, to the epileptic girl who overcomes her patron's rejection to create a life for herself, these stories' characters are sensitively drawn, leaving them etched into our subconscious. What does become of the woman who guards the stairway of an apartment complex, only to be kicked out after she loses all of her life's savings?My mother handed me this book a week ago and insisted that I read it. Once I started I realized I had already read it a year or two before. But I drank up the stories again, happily indulging in the beautiful writing."
4,I am a teenage guy and I liked it,"This was one of the two books that I needed to read for summer reading. At first I thought I wouldn't like it, but I actually did. Out of the 9 stories, I wasn't too fond of three of them- ""A real Durwan"", ""this blessed house"", and ""the treatment of bibi haldar"". Others especially ""Sexy"" and ""the third and final continent"" were great (those two were my favorite). For some of them, I wished that the story didn't end because I liked it so much. The author's writing style is very good and did not bore me. There is some sexuality in it that is interesting for teenage guys :). Also I like the use of brand names, places, and colleges that can help me further relate to the characters. It probably also helped that my girlfriend and one of my friends is Indian. Had I enjoyed all 9 stories, I would have given it a 5/5. All in all, its a good book for everyone, even the white suburban middle to upperclass teenage male."
1,Don't Buy,"I felt as if my head was being beaten against a flower pot. I was hoping to read a book about gardening, not about racial situations. Couldn't finish it. Sorry. There are better books out there. I know Miss Kincaid must have an agenda, but why drag in into the garden?"
2,Skip it,"Has this woman never heard of punctuation? Her sentences are so long you practically have to tie yourself in a knot to read them. This is a shame, because before I got turned off by the sentence length I had spotted some fresh ideas. I toiled on until I realized there was no depth of knowledge behind the ideas. There are lots of good, even great, books of garden essays out there. Don't waste your time on this one."
1,You Have to be Kidding? Who are these pianists?,"The sound was terrible. This was not the F&T pianists I had the privilege of seeing and hearing years ago. One piece sounded like my grandson pounding on the base keys, no melody could be decifered! Very disappointing recording or else it wasn't Mr. F and Mr. T! The music sounded better on the RealPlayer sample than on the CD I purchased. Very poor sound control."
4,Easy Enchantments......The name says it all,"This book is pretty good , easy to follow spells with all the components that you need for spells in your spice cabinet. There are no hard to find ingredients just simple things right from your kitchen that Really work. I love this book"
1,an insult to the craft,"ms. rosean's books are pop-culture witchcraft, of very shaky background and quality. i do not intend to get involved in personal attacks, but i have met lexa on a few occasions and she was rather arrogant and rude, not at all like the image witches should be projecting as we try to reclaim our position as respectable members of society. for anyone who is interested in learning about the craft, dont waste your money on this."
1,Unfortunate waste of time,"Recently purchased the CS18 Grass Shears and was looking forward to using this extension handle to give my back a break. Unfortunately though, the grass shears would not fully attach to the extension handle, so the shears would wobble around and fall off. Very disappointed."
1,Very poor quality,"I had an old unit by the manufacturer this company replaced for many years, and it died. This is something I use infrequently, but need occasionally. The little clippers, while not great, are pretty good, but I went through 3 handles (2 from Amazon and 1 from manufacturer) before I got one I finally knocked on (not slid on). The plugs are at such an angle they don't slide into the socket. I'm afraid to try to take the handle off because it may come off or go back on, but it has to be off to charge (old one charged in the handle). Doesn't work very well in the handle either. It has to be used at an angle so it doesn't clip the grass very well.Had no problems with Amazon or manufacturer customer service."
1,"Poor quality, flimsy, does not function","I read the poor reviews and decided to order this extension handle anyway. I should not have done so, as the unit is really junk. It is extremely flimsy, and the switch does not activate the grass shear. There is intermittent contact, but it's clear the problem is with the handle, not the operator or the grass shear. Save yourself a problem, and don't bother with this extension handle. I'll be returning it to Amazon later today. The grass shear that does with the handle has been working well so far, so the poor quality of this extension handle is disappointing. American Gardener should be ashamed of selling such a poor quality product."
2,Lushly mounted Burt without the emotion,"Though rarely have Bacharach's works received such a lush production, rarer however is the airlessness with which these classics have been performed. A collection of Broadway-trained voices interpret some intruingly obscure Bacharach songs with an alarming lack of feeling and a preponderance of technigue.Predictably, the songs associated with Dionne Warwick fare the worst under this Velveeta treatent, and one is left to merely enjoy Bacharach's splendid music imagining how they might sound performed by artists with souls. The best cut by far is La Chanze's ""Anyone Who Had a Heart"", and it's always nice to hear Helen Reddy again.The best thing about the album is that it introduces some seldom-heard Bacharach and will perhaps send listeners out to find the original recordings for some indication as to how these songs should sound by artists with a deeper understanding of the lyrics and less of a determination to 'sell it'."
2,"Well acted thriller, but I wouldn't want to buy it.","The acting is good, and it's creepy enough to hold your interest, but the endingwas a letdown, I'd say - movies, especially thrillers, don't have to be realistic and logical, but the ending just seemed too unrealistic to me, and as somebody else pointed out, tacking on Mama Cass singing""Dream a Little Dream of Me"" as the credits roll didn't help. Another one I'm happy that I saw on TV. Worth seeing once, I'd say,and it's now erased. The test of a good film is: would you recommend it to a friend? Even if I had a friend who liked thrillers, I'd say, ""You can skip this one."""
2,Missing Pages,"I purchased this book for a college class that I was taking at the time and needed it ASAP, when I got the book- 3 of the assessments were missing out of it!! They were VERY important to my grade. I was able to borrow a book from a friend but NEVER would have paid $30 for a book that was missing pages!!"
4,Perfect Solution,"These coach lights are the best solution I have found to adding beautiful lighting to the front of my house without having to add the expense of putting in switches. They work perfectly and they are lovely to look at. They add function, safety and elegance to my home's facade. Better than anything else on the market for this price. Very good buy."
2,Not the Complete Concert!,This CD was actually released in 1989 and BMG doesn't tell you that the single disc release in not the complete concert. The complete concert is available as a two disc import from Germany and also available at this site. The import is worth the money. This release isn't.
1,Not Complete,"What the heck is it with this junk of not releasing the complete concert the way we all remember it?Fortunately, Amazon carries an import version that is the COMPLETE concert and the transfer from the original master tapes is utterly superb.As an aside, Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra recorded two Lp's worth of Johann Strauss waltzes and associated pieces also for RCA, yet they REFUSE to put it out properly complete on a TWO CD set; the transfers are also an abomination."
3,Wish I had read the reviews,Had I look at the reviews instead of just getting excited and ordering I would have discovered that I was purchasing an incomplete show. I own the vinyl of this and love it. This was disappointing. But I have learned to always... always check the reviews even on items I think I know.
4,This is a good alternative for Palm Developers,"I was developing software for Handspring using CodeWarrior. Unfortunately the current CodeWarrior(c) does not support USB yet, so I have to look for a serial cradle for Handspring. This is very helpful for me to download the Palm binary code for POSE/Palm emulator.I haven't tried this cradle to other softwares, put it seems to work to other softwares too as long as they have COMx supports."
5,Xena in a box!,"I think this CD was a perfect representation of the television show with wonderful music. It provides not only relaxing music, but also powerful orchestrations with spine-tingling chants. A must-have for any Xena-Fan!"
1,Ocean's Thirteen,Not any where near as good as the films preceeding it. Big stars but little on substance. They have over extended themselves on this concept or theme.
3,The con is on,"One of the original Ocean's 11 gang (Elliott Gould) is stiffed by a business partner (Al Pacino) and suddenly George Clooney's gang reunites to wreak revenge. They plan a high tech/hijinks sabatoge of Pacino's new casino in which they turn the opening night into a fiasco. The plan is complex and multi-faceted and begins to run together in a confusing mess before the film is over. There are so many stars who need good lines that there are not enough to go around and the plot sputters as a result.Despite these flaws, there is some fun to be found in the third of the Ocean's 11 series."
5,Great movie,"13 is my favorite of the three. The rapport between Cloony & Pitt is marvelous, as it is too with the entire ensemble. Highly recommended as a good old fashioned movie - ironic given its' setting in Vegas."
5,Ocean's Thirteen,"Danny Ocean (Clooney) and his gang are back, this time to get revenge against Willie Bank (Pacino). Bank has screwed over Reuben Tishkoff (Gould), and taken his land and money to build a new casino, causing Reuben to have a heart attack. The gang, led by Ocean, Rusty Ryan (Pitt), and Linus Caldwell (Damon), decide to put the new casino deep into the red and steal Bank's diamonds.""Ocean's 13"" is a vast improvement over ""12"" and on par with ""11"", if not a little better. The cast know their characters so well by this point and have a great chemistry. You know that they had fun making this movie, and it shows. The action is minimum, but interest is sustained through following their plan as it comes to fruition. There are some twists, but nothing earth-shattering. Mostly, this is a chance to see good actors doing their thing. Fans of this series will not be disappointed, and although director Steven Soderbergh says this is the last one, I can't help but hope that he changes his mind."
1,"Horrible Video Quality, Buy the DVD Instead","All I can say is that I am extremely disappointed in the video quality for a high definition disc. Sure, the picture sharpness is way better then DVD, but there is SO much noise and grain in the video, it is almost unwatchable. A friend got the DVD and even though it is not as crisp, the grain and noise is so much less. I am completely disappointed in this Bluray version. So much in fact that I am trying to exchange for the DVD version it is so bad. It is as if the disc is defective, but from reading other reviews, that is just how bad this version is. Stay away."
1,Warning to People with Upconverting DVD Player or Receiver,"I have a new Samsung 1080p HDTV and an Onkyo A/V receiver which upconverts video to near HD quality using the Faroudja processing chip. Every other Standard Definition DVD I have watched on this system looks fantastic. However, Oceans 13 looked awful. The picture was very grainy and the colors were distorted. The actors all had orange skin which made them look like they slathered themselves with some cheap tanning lotion. I could only stand to watch about 45 minutes of this DVD.I did some research online and found that a few DVDs don't look good when processed by an upconverting DVD player or receiver. Oceans 13 was specifically mentioned on one A/V forum as a DVD which looks awful when upconverted. Very disappointing to say the least. If you have an upconverting DVD player or receiver, don't waste your money on this movie."
4,A little over the top....the script started running all over the place,"I loved Ocean's 11 and I liked Ocean's 12. Ocean's 13 was not that great. First off the premise itself was a little over the top - it is one thing planning a heist, another to plan a heist with every table, every slot winning and the house losing (no, I am not giving out any secrets here). This is an ambitious attempt (daring?), but then everything seems to fall in place so easy. And it just doesn't have the same feel of thrill, suspense, excitement whatever. Good for a watch, but not much more."
2,I'm being generous with 2 stars,"After really enjoying Ocean's 11 & 12, we were really looking forward to 13. What a hodgepodge of scenes with very little thread to tie them together. Save your money - if you feel you have to see this, go rent it to see if you really like it. I bet you won't end up buying a copy."
2,What a bore,Don't waste the time to watch this film. Old tricks and lame acting make this film a complete dud.
4,Ocean Thirteen,"I love the actors in the films such as Brad Pitt and George Clooney, and the friendship and how they tease each other, etc. They are two of my most, favorite actors. I would see any movie in which they starred in. Brad and George are doing GOOD WORK for this world, and I am happy, very happy, that they use their celebrity, famous names to make or speak up for people who are not listened to because of our normal lives.Thanks George and Brad, keep doing what you both are doing.P.S. I love and am proud of you both EQUALLY, so do not look whose name I write first. THANKS SO MUCH fOR YOUR HOURS OF GREAT ENTERTAINMENT - both of the MOVIE SCREEM, Televison, or the DVD's I purchase."
3,Blu-ray disc not worth the extra money,"I am just commenting on the picture quality of the blu-ray version of Ocean's 13. I enjoyed the movie, but the quality of the picture was lacking compared to other blu-ray discs. I don't know what happened, but the colors are inconsistent and some shots are grainy. At first I thought it was a style choice, but the picture quality jumps around so much I doubt that now. This really didn't look any better than a standard DVD. This seems to be a problem with the transfer, not my individual disc. I have checked on other forums and everyone seems to be complaining. Don't waste your money on this blu-ray disc, just buy the standard DVD."
2,A little better than Ocean's 12,"But that isn't really saying much is it? Most of the comedy fails and left my theater quiet. Some cool moments, although not realistic, kept my attention at least part of the time. The cast is great, but most are simply given nothing to do. Wait for the DVD if you must see it."
4,No One Advertised It As Fine Art,"Sometimes a movie is made JUST to entertain (gasp!), and entertain it did. Plot weaknesses, yes, but overall it was slick, fun, and I didn't have to ponder over the subtle, sub-text meaning when I left the theatre. I just left smiling.....oh,I wouldn't be doing the movie justice if I didn't mention the eye-candy aspect for women of all ages!!!"
4,A fine installment to a fun trilogy,"At the very least, you'll think it was second best of the three movies (at least to date, who knows?). A fun movie, if only to watch Casey Affleck and Scott Caan play the Mormon twins. If they hadn't worked with such a ridiculous cast, those two could've stolen the film."
2,Is it dark in here?,This movie is sooooo slow and never gets a good take off. The filming is dark and you can hardly tell who is in each scene. The story line could have been a good one but the filming ruined it. So far Ocean's 11 is the best of the three.
5,great book,I loved the book when I was little and wanted to share it with the kids in my classroom. The company that shipped it was quick and everything looked great =)
3,Her Popularity is growing,"Jessica Simpson seems to be getting more popular than ever, she is now re-releasing her IN THIS SKIN album which has already sold over a million copies already. Has she finally reached her goal of being up there with christina and britney?"
3,her remake's right on target,"I have not been a fan of Jessica's music. Enjoy the reality show though. It was there I first heard her sing 'Take My Breath Away'. I love her version of this song, and it was enough to make my buy the album. I never expected to have a Jessica Simpson CD in my collection, but she has reached out of her fan base with this more grown up sound."
5,THE BEST THING EVER x INFINITY and BEYOND so nobody could me,THIS IS THE BEST CD EVER! IT IS RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE! WITH YOU IS THE BEST SONG IN THIS CD. PLEASE BUY THIS CD ASAP BECAUSE THE PERSON THAT WROTE THIS REVIEW SAYS THAT JESSICA SIMPSON HAS THE SWEETEST VOICE EVER. THANK YOU.
5,EXCELLENT CD!!!!,"My boyfriend bought me this cd because it is all I talked about for so long. I think it is an EXCELLENT cd! I haven't listened to any other cd since he bought it for me. I think this is a cd that girls will like, but guys probably wont like it that well. My boyfriend doesn't really like it. He only likes about 3 songs. I love the whole cd. It is a great love cd. I find that a lot of the songs are easy to relate to, and I think this cd reflets her life, and where she is at in her life now. I have always been a fan of Jessica! I think she has a wonderful voice! This is a cd to have in your collection if you want a cd that is filled with an excellent voice!"
4,Um...,"OK this cd is AWESOME but one thing I might advise is that if your into fast tempo and dancing song, this isn't a cd for you. This is simply love and emotions and soothing instruments but the cd is good!!!"
5,Awesome cd,"I think Jessica's cd is great. Loved her songs,especially Sweetest Sin. Also, I love her relationship with Nick. Their relationship reminds me so much of me and my boyfriend. I'm glad they air the reality show because it's really interesting to watch a couple in the music industry and how they deal with being so busy. I really hope they last forever. It would be sad to hear of them getting a divorce or something. They look good together. Secondly, I don't think Jessica is dumb at all! She is very successful and no one can take that away from her. She has a great personality, is down to earth, and she's funny."
1,I liked her better when she was called Britney Spears...,"Both versions of Jessica's latest album ""In This Skin"" are dull with exception of two songs ""With You"" and ""Sweetest Sin."" This CD was full of terrible filler the first go around, and now she adds a mediocre remake of a song best sung by Berlin, and she expects the American public to eat it up. Maybe she really is as dumb as she pretends to be on her television show.Save your money and pick up a CD by a much more fun entertainer like Britney, Christina, or even Mandy Moore. Jessica's music is just too bland for words."
4,Good effort - decent but not as radio-friendly,"2003's In This Skin is the kind of album that grows on you with each listen. Surprisingly intimate in comparison to the prehistoric days of her debut ('99) and sophomore effort ('01), Skin showcases the just-married Jessica Simpson as a sexy, but never raunchy woman enjoying married life to its fullest. Though her vocals sound contrived, throaty and at times strained, it is the great song material that carries this CD to new heights of opportunity for Mrs. Nick Lachey, even though none of the tune-age (except ""With You"") is as radio-ready as heard in her previous two. The amount of filler is apparent at first-listen, but it's decent filler nonetheless. Although her hit TV show ""Newlyweds"" definitely played a huge part in the success of In This Skin, it is her refreshing sound and tactful song choices that truly shine through. Jessica Simpson bares her soul here and proves that her 15 minutes of fame are worth the while."
4,Excellent,"This album is excellent. I just want to trie her and I think I choose a really good one. She sings better than Britney, but Shakira sings better than she does. This album is for teenagers and adult. Buy it !"
3,Get the original release and pay less.,"Okay, you are paying more for 2 songs that are covers and do not outshine the originals at all. Plus, wow, an acoustic version of With You. Is paying extra really worth it? I don't think so. Get the original release and pay less. I would have given this CD 4 stars if the covers were not included."
1,Stay away!!,"This album is nothing but junk, with crap remakes and horrendous vocals. This idiot used a TV show to jumpstart her career because she couldn't do it using her talent, or lack of talent. The fact is she's a horrible singer and this album should be thrown in the garbage!!"
1,THIS DOES NOT GET UNDER MY SKIN,"REALLY BAD PRETENTIOUS PIFFLE OF A CD FROM THIS TERRIBLE,TALENTLESS BABE.FULL OF CHEESY CORNY SONGS AVOID."
1,Can't Do any Better,"Sorry but she is always 2nd place. She never made it to the Mickey mouse Club, and I can totally see why. She couldn't release a good CD the first time, so she had to RE-RELEASE the same crappy CD again. Ok I have to admit SWeetest Sin is good but that all she has....... She is nothing but a C-- grading, and its thanks to her husband that people are actually starting to notice her. I mean really.......She does nothing but dis Britney and Christina all because She didn't make it Until Now..."
5,Jessica Simpson.......... One Of The Best Pop Singers,"I don't no what is up with the haters? Ok, it's not the best album in the world but Jessica put a lot of effort into the album. I thought she did a great job. I don't know why I'm thinking this but I think there's like a promotional team trying to write bad reviews just to get people to buy something else. I've seen more than one review on George the record producer. Columbia records and Jessica did a good job. I would originally give it 5 stars. There is most likey a group of people writing bad reviews. Just stop. You can't sing as good as her and I would like you to do your own album but you can't because you are low life haters"
2,A bit too much,"On every track of this album, when she sings, it sounds all breathy like she's in the middle of a bowel movement, or just ran a marathon and stepped into the studio to record. I believe she would be great with some serious voice coaching..."
2,Please Stop Her from ruining these songs!,"OK, I can tolerate ""With You"" as a bland piece of forgettable pop. At least with that song I don't have to turn off the radio.""Take My Breath Away"", however, does make me turn off the radio. The song is supposed to be sensual and sultry, and Ms. Simpson just doesn't express that. The vocals are a little annoying, too, but not when compared to......""Angels"". Robbie Williams made this a classic, full of overwhelming emotion and expression, and only 5 years ago or so! Well, not only does this version of the song convey no emotion (the singing technique is too mechanical) but the majority of the song is in a higher register which Ms. Simpson can hit and, frankly, her voice here sounds like a twisted piece of metal shrieking while being torn apart. It hurts my ears.She gets more than 1 star due to a decent song selection and the fact the she helps write. Execution is a failure, though."
1,From 5 stars to 1 with this rerelease/reissue trickery!!,"I rated the original release of this CD five stars, BUT...reissuing with Robbie William's ""Angels""?? She doesn't have the vocal chops or musical understanding to do that song. That is the song I chose to remember my grandmother by and she has smeared that song. Her breathy and whispy attempts to put emotion in it are a musical train wreck.Bottom line: Jessica should be assassinated for this reissue. You can't get much lower on the greed scale than this."
1,I have never heard a album as bad as this one!,"Jessica has made decent albums in the past but this recent effort is just sad I dont know what happened to her?Her song's quality are horrible they were produced very badly plus her voice is not as good as it was on her last album it sounds like it's getting weaker?(I dont know whats up with that)Anyways this album realy showed me the lowness that an album can actualy reach!And that special DVD coming with this is a rip off totally rip off it has 11 minutes of her acting stupid as usual!I think it's sad that she dident work her way to be populer with her music but she used her stupidity to get where she is today and I think thats just sad and wrong!I suggest even the Jessica fan's that haven't purchased this yet to not purchase it,all you will be very upset with her trust me I am!"
4,"chicken, or tuna?","With this album, Jessica Simpson moved ahead of Britney and Christina in contemporary pop. Jessica proves that you don't have to be a sexpot or head case to be a successful pop princess. She sounds a bit like a modern Olivia Newton-John. Don't miss this one."
4,Very nice cd,I think this is one of the better cd's out there right now. Jessica simpson's voice and style has matured alot and it is very obvious on this cd. She put more of herself into this cd and it shows.
5,bautiful,this cd is really realaxing. i listen to i all the time i enjoy the songs and theres abit of veritie on it.i would say me fave song on it is: well really all of them but In This SKin cause it has a rock part to it. luv it 10/5 i i could its brill' it does truly take u off to another world.i think underneath is about how she went out with nick and then went out with someone and that pasically tells the story i was co-written by the same person the wrote why not for hilary duff {matthew gerrad} jessica also co-wrote it.all in all a brilliant album can't get eny better.i am proud a brought it.luv and lightdelbritjess
1,pale initation of the original....,"I listen to this CD, and I think it is laughable, all the songs are boring and plain. I don't understand why would anyone like her version of ""Take My Breath Away"". If you really like this song, buy the original, it is so much better. I read these reviews and I am shocked that some people think Jessica Simpson's music are real music. She has no soul and no brain, and it could easily tell from her music. I don't know why this album even released."
1,I hate her so much!!!,Jessica Simpson is a conceited nasty spoiled selfish witch that can't sing! The only thing on her that's real is her eyes.
1,Poor Jessica,"...and I thought she sucked BEFORE. I only gave her one star because there is no option for zero. Sometimes I wonder how someone like her could get to the low level of fame she has(keyword- low). I know at least twenty other people (myself included) who are waaay more talented than her. My dog is more talented than her. And for all of you annoying die-hard fans, go ahead with your ""YOU DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT GOOD MUSIC""s and ""JESSICA SIMPSON 4EVA""s (ps- learn how to spell. It really makes you look stupid). So anyone reading this thinking they might get it despite the bad reviews, this is one time where you should listen to the reviews. Save your 10 bucks. Go buy some food, or something you can get your money's worth out of."
1,GARBAGE!!,"Throw this in the dumpster, along with Jessica's career. This album is so painfully awful, I can't even begin to describe!"
1,PLEEZE - - SACRILEGE TO ROBBIE'S VERSION OF ANGELS,Why does America settle for mediocrity like this - with the likes of her and Clay Aiken - - who doesn't the States wake up to Robbie Williams - - - why - why - why - -
4,Better than average......,"The cd was overall pretty good, but in my opinion I thought it was kind of blah. There were only 3 new songs, and 2 of them were remakes (Angels, Take My Bretahe Away) which she hadn't written herself. The songs that she put on her 3rd cd (In This Skin (2003)) were orginal and fun to sing and dance too. But in my opinion I think they should of put those remakes on her nect cd. I really am a big fan of Jessica but this cd is not her best work. If you plan on buying one of this In This Skin versions I'd plan on buying this one because it has more than the 2003 In This Skin."
1,Horrendous,"Don't even THINK about buying this load of crap! It's not even worth $1, let alone $15. The songs are cheap, the vocals are terrible, the production is laughable, and the lyrics are as cheesier than Hilary Duff's. I made the mistake of buying this and I'm hoping you don't. Don't buy into the hype, there is absolutely no quality behind this industry joke."
1,NEW IRON MAIDEN CD COMING OUT SOON,"WELL,GUYS JESSICA SIMPSON IS THR WORST OF THE WORST.SHE SINGS AS BADLY AS SHE LOOKS.THIS CD IS VERY,VERY,VERY BAD.AVOID AND WAIT FOR THE NEW IRON MAIDEN CD WHICH SHOULD BE OUT SHORTLY."
1,Poop to my ears,"its sad her career is based off of distinguishing tuna from chicken. as for the music, its poop to my ears."
3,MEH!,Ive had to listen to this album many a time because my sister and best friend are great fans of the blonde one while I am more of an ashlee fan but its not as bad as everyone is saying the only thing she cant be forgiven for is the fact she murders Robbie williams angels a song which is meant to be sang subtley and not stamped all over with vocal aerobics but I have to admit the rest of the labum is ok!
5,Amazing New Album!,"Jessica's new album is unlike anything she's ever done before. She wrote 80% of the album and sings beautifully throughout the entire thing. The album is very inspirational and soothing. It's deffinately worth getting even if you aren't a fan, because she is going to MAKE a fan out of you in one listen of the cd!"
4,Righting a Wrong,"When I first began using my Visor, I was struck by the lightweight plastic stylus provided by Handspring. I got used to it, but considering the importance of this part to the product's use (sure, you can use your finger, but...), I was a bit surprised that Handspring didn't spring for a more substantial stylus. That problem is user-fixable with this product.The heft of the replacement stylus makes writing simpler, and the aluminum-colored shafts look better when Visoring in public. It's nice to have spares, and all the colors fit well with my graphite Visor.Handspring should have included a couple of these with your Visor, but since they didn't, here you are. A user-friendliness oversight or marketing strategy? That's another issue."
4,Perfect for Middle School,"I puchased this dictionary for my daughter who is in eighth grade. She had outgrown the children's dictionary, but the college dictionary was just too much for her. The definitions in this volume are at just the right level for her. We like the pictures, too. I especially like the ""famous person"" entries. When you don't need an encyclopedic reference for a historical figure -- just an idea of who he or she was -- this is great. My only complaint is that word origins are not included."
4,The downward spiral of the Terran Empire,"From the back cover of the 1985 Ace Science Fiction edition:Introducing Dominic Flandry...Before he's through he'll have saved worlds and become the confidant of emperors. But for now he's seventeen years old, as fresh and brash a sprig of the nobility as you would care to know. The only thing as damp as the place behind his ears is the ink on his brand-new commission.Though through this and his succeeding adventures he will struggle gloriously and win (usually) mighty victories, Dominic Flandry is essentially a tragic figure: a man who knows too much, who knows that battle, scheme and even betray as he will, in the end it will mean nothing. For with the relentlessness of physical law the Long Night approaches. The Terran Empire is dying..."
2,i thought newer was better?,"basicaly 1503 ad isnt that fun. its to complex and to much stuff that dosent do much but you need to continue on in the game. 1602 ad is a really fun game if you buy this and dont like it there is a good chance wat you wanted is somthing like 1602 ad.1602 is just cpmlicated enough and has many challenges like pirate muraders and valcanoes, and drought, so if you dont like it you should give a try to 1602 ad. why becuase its better."
2,The Crime at Black Dudley,"The Crime at Black Dudley was, I think, the first of the Albert Campion books; certainly Margery Allingham had not yet gotten into her stride. Her later books were much better as regards plot and characterization, and were amusing into the bargain, with characters like the inimitable Lugg and a charming Scotland Yard man whose name, at the moment, escapes me. Almost any of the later works would be better to start on, unless your interest is historical."
2,The Source has put out better... ALOT better.,"The only reason I put this at 2 stars is because they put my man Luda on the disc. If it wasn't for him, I'd have this CD in the trash... oh wait, I own the 2Fast2Furious Soundtrack, Hip Hop Hits IS in the trash. Don't waste your money, this CD sucks."
1,Don't Get them,"the magazine is decent, but there Customer support is [...]. They wont help you solve any issues and wont send there magazine to the right address. I personally wont buy from them again. and my family has had a shutterbug subscription for almost as long as they have been in business. So in my opinion you should look at another magazine if you want to get a product that you can rely on."
5,Shutterbug Magazine,"This magazine has been very helpful for me in polishing my skills as a photographer. It's a great resource for photographers at any level,John Crippen Photography.Animal Portraits with the Digital Photography of John Crippen: Learning Photography with AnimalsANDScenic Photography Using Examples from the California Central Coast: A Visual Guide to the Central Coast and Digital Photography"
4,Good holster,"Don't use it much, as it is too much bigger than the knife imho. But it does the job and quality/price is good. Small spring (just like the one on the knife)to hold it in the pocket or on the leg is a nice touch."
4,good memories of Yellowstone,"If you have been to Yellowstone, this cd will evoke memories, if not, it will make you want to go."
1,I RETURNED THIS CD,"I LOVE Mannheim Steamroller. Before this CD, I could honestly say they had not made one CD I didn't like. The only music I did like on the CD was from other CD's I already owned. I felt fortunate since, when I took it back to the store where I'd purchased it, I told them I had played it but just didn't like it and was hoping they would give me a discount on another. They let me exchange it out right. Very disappointing. NOT typical of Mannheim."
5,Excellent book!,"Excellent book, lots of great info on hot peppers which I have had great luck with myself, losing weight, greatly reduced cholesterol, much more energy, etc.. Only downfall is Amazon is not packaging their books well anymore, I ordered $100 worth of books that were all thrown in a box and arrived all banged up! This is the 2nd order in a row, I will think twice about ordering again as I dont care for my books being all banged up! They used to use a cellofane wrapper to hold them all together but guess it was a cost cutting measure, sad to see damaged books.."
1,Barbie Team Gymnastics,It did not perform correctly. It says you can make your own routines and practice different skills. I couldn't get it to do anything but have a performance sheet - which always stayed blank!
2,Disapointing,I am an avid reader of Chris' articles in M&F. And I started out enjoying the book. Until I began to read a lot of misguiding information I put it down.
5,best pocket flashlight ever!,"These are the best pocket flashlights ever. Small enough to fit in a pocket unnoticed, but powerful enough to light your way out of anything. And the battery life is so long that in normal use, you will never get around to having to replace the batteries at all. My only complaint is that I have to keep buying more because my friends keep taking the ones I have with me."
2,Don't buy the blue beam.,"The good thing is that it seems to be constructed well. The bad is that this pen light, with its dull fuzzy blue beam, doesn't light up anything very well. It is very difficult for me to make out anything that I'm looking at.No instructions or paperwork of any kind came with my light, and it took a few minutes to figure how to make the pen light stay on without constantly pressing the button. Sometimes when I'm working in a dark area I hold a pen light in my mouth so I can use both hands.I finally found out, after a few minutes of experimenting, that you can just push the button in and hold it to get light, or twist the end where the button is located clockwise and it will stay on.I'm glad it stays on when you twist the end where the button is, My tongue isn't strong enough to hold the button in by itself. But now that I know how it operates, I would advise a white beam, if you are trying to see something in the dark."
5,DUI officers best friend,"The stylus serves as the perfect stimulus for HGN, the blue light is easy to look at and doesn't effect my night vision. S/H was high but still good deal."
3,Not the best...,"New Flecktones records always get me excited. Triple CD sets usually do not-- it indicates artists who are given too much time to play in the studio, with too little focus. This set lived up (or down) to my expectations. Yes, there are some brilliant tunes here, but WAY to many tunes that are uninspired and indulgent. It's just not something you can listen to from start to finish and like every tune, like UFOTofu, and even the last couple of CDs. Guess I should have bought the single-CD version of this-- but I just love the Flecktones too much. I will say, though, that the Nickel Creek tunes are the best-- those guys are brilliant."
2,Eisenhower's Italian Campaign a Rewrite of Fatal Decision Chapters,"I really like Carlo D'estes books. His books are very informative and entertaining while educating you about the subject material. I read Patton and I thought it was the best biography of him compared to others I have read. I read this book on Eisenhower a few months ago and originally I believed it was pretty good...that was until I read Fatal Decision (which I just read).Fatal Decision is an earlier book of his and it is very good- what I would excpet from Carlo D'este. However, I noticed that I felt that I had read it before or at least the first part. I compared the text from Eisenhower Italian Campaign and the First Part of Fatal Decision...to my surprise Eisenhower's chapters are just a rewrite of that with a a decent amount of the same sentences or structure interdispersed between the books. Sorry...but this is unacceptable to me and has lowered my opinion of him as a writer."
3,Not the best,"By far the superior Biography of Ike is Ambros's 'Eisenhower: Soldier and President'. Carlo's biography differs in that it covers only the war period. Weak on the Lousiana Manuevors it does detail essential aspects of Ike's career. It explains his terrible experience as staff officer to Macarthur. It also shows his dull career as an army nothing in which he trudged through years of worthlessness before being appointed the top job in Europe.Ikes story is purely American. Unnoticed for years, with a less then interesting record at West Point, he was picked by Marshall to lead the men ashore in N. Africa.This biography explains the essential Ike, the books Maps are well presented and show the tactivcal units that most books fail to show. Nevertheless the writing lacks and Este's account does not do him justice.Carlo is well known writer on WWII, his books on Patton and his books on the Italian and Sicialian camapigns are one of a kind, but this focus on Ike is not his best work."
4,A Good Seat,I am very happy with my Graco car seat. I used a Graco infant seat as well and was happy with that. This seat is very secure and even fits in my small car. The restraint is exactly the same as the infant seat and it made the conversion from infant to toddler seat a smooth transition. I do have one complaint about this seat. The dark color and material used on this seat picks up all kinds of lint and hair. It's the same as if you had a black car interior. But overall I am very happy with my seat.
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this car seat as a second one for my husband's car. We didn't use it that much until my second child came along. I hate this car seat. The straps are not long enough to fit around my 7 month old with his jacket one. It is impossible to adjust the straps when it is rear facing. My son crys every time I put him in it. He just looks so uncomfortable. The other car seat I have is the Britax Marathon, which I love. My advice, spend the extra money for a Britax you will not be sorry."
2,"O.K. Case, But Could Be Better","The only reason I got this case was because Handspring was offering it free when you bought the Visor Deluxe. It is really well made, but doesn't seem to quite fit the Visor. The case is a little to small to close tightly over the screen. Because I tend to drop my Visor into my purse or briefcase, I wasn't really comfortable with the level of protection this case provided.I also didn't like the velcro closure, but then I'm not a big fan of velcro closures in general. All in all, I'm going to keep using the case that came with the visor as well to the protective plastic cover until I find something better."
3,Nothing Too Exciting.,Not much of an improvement over the case that comes with the Visor. Save your money.
1,Record company got in the way,"This is what happens when you have a great unique sound that is harsh in a good way, and then the major record company sez ""now for your next album, we want you to go in this direction"" and then the group puts out an over-produced boring mish-mash. Buy the first album (the EP ""Whip It On"") but don't waste your hard-earned money (you did earn it, didn't you) on this gruel."
1,"Lame, Self-Absorbed, Untalented Poseurs","So I guess Sune Rose Wagner is mostly to blame for this stuff. The girl, Sharin Foo, would appear to be just for looks. The CD is completely unlistenable. It's going to the used CD store."
3,Can't get into it,"After several listens and constant hopes of finally ""getting"" the album, I just can't get into it. Not to say the songs are bad: there's some good pop melodies aching to bust loose of the glossy wall of feedback production. But there lies the problem: in trying to drench the album in feedback, they effectively dampen the impact the songs could have without 15 tracks of noise. Perhaps the next time..."
5,Excellent Quality,"I just received this set via Fed Ex,today.First thing I noticed was,the weight of the shipping box.You could get a serious workout with this thing.Upon opening the shipping box,I then inspected the plastic storage box,the sockets came in.The storage box seems to be very durable,and well made.Granted,it's not some ""top of the line"",HIGHLY overpriced set.But,for the money,I can't see a better made impact set out there.I haven't tried 'em out yet.But,the sockets definitely feel nice and thick/heavy.You don't wanna use something lightweight and flimsy,in the middle of a job.So,if you're skeptical about the quality due to their cheap price,don't be! This is a fabulous set for the money!"
5,Wonderful!,"This CD is the CD to get if you like game shows! It has all the big ones (The Price is Right, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy!, To Tell The Truth, Pyramid, and Match Game), plus it has many, many others throughout!"
2,"A bit of a letdown, but still a good CD","I can only give a mild recommendation for this CD... sure, it's got some themes that are very familiar to a lot of us (good to hear the original ""Changing Keys"" theme to ""Wheel of Fortune"" and the words to the 1960s/70s version of To Tell the Truth), but if you are one of those game show mutants like myself, you'll note that there's so many differences among the themes here and the ones we're used to hearing:-- The ""Password"" theme here comes from the ABC 1971-1974 run, not the swing theme from its CBS heyday or the upbeat version from 1974-1975.-- The ""Joker's Wild"" theme is only the opening theme looped over and over again.-- The ""$25K/$100K Pyramid"" theme is way too short - I remember it being much, much longer than the one listed here.-- The ""Card Sharks"" theme from 1978 is NOT the extended closing theme that I was expecting.You'll like this CD if you're into game shows. However, I suggest you sit tight and get the Volume 2 CD."
4,works great but you need to know it's limitations,"I love this thing, it works great, came fast, everything is just as I wanted.Easy to set up, easy to use. ONE THING--the dvd's I recorded are only in one format, pay attention to this--it's in dvd-r mode. That means you can't play the recordings on any other machine that is dvd+r mode. I can't even view them on my computer. So unless you plan on only viewing your recordings on this particular machine and not on any other, and you don't plan on giving them to anyone else who may / may NOT have a player that plays dvd-r format recordings...be forewarned. I reckon they'll standardize the format eventually--like vhs - beta debate years ago. But for now, just be aware. Otherwise, I really really like this machine!!"
1,not a good dvd recorder,does not have a remote control so it is impossible to navigate thru a videodoes not have an instruction bookdoes not have any cords to connect it to a tvi owned a panasonic dvd ram recorder that worked great for a year and a half before i bought this one to replace it but when i got the samsung it would not play the dvd rams that i used to play on my panasonic unit.needless to say i sent it back for a refund and i will not buy anything else from samsung.
3,"Not bad, not outstanding either","Not my favorite, but not bad either. I like the Taylors of Harrogate brand, but this tea is just ok to me."
3,Half an expansion,"This expansion adds a few new vehicles (which play like the old ones) and French/Italian troops (which play like the old ones). I've played through the new maps and they look and play a lot like the original ones.In my opinion a good expansion is one that I can't stand to play the game without. With Road to Rome, I really couldn't care less. I enjoy many of the original maps better."
2,Not as good as the original one,"There's ONLY 6 additional missions & they are all instant battles. The missions are harder (even in Easy mode) than the original. There's a few new weapons, vehicles, & airplanes. On the Allied side, there's 1 mission where you play as the Americans, 3 as the Frenches, & 2 as the Britishes. The Italians' uniform (not uniforms, ...) looks a lot like the Americans' one which can be a little confusing when the ""name"" of the soldier does not appear (happens sometime) on top of him. & the Frenches wear the Britishes' parachutist uniform."
3,Too many things in no depth,"I'm not saying this is not a good game. But certainly this is NOT one of the best WW2 games. Yes, it has almost everything you want to see in battle. Infantry, tanks, bombers, fighters, aircraft carriers, jeeps and so on. But it fails to make players feel the thrill of battlefield and experience WW2. In BF1942, all weapons and equipments are too simple and unreal. Moreover, it is ridiculous that you can identify friend/foe with name tags from a distance. Well... enjoyable if you don't know about WW2 and don't care the reality of battlefield. But this is not for WW2 fans like me."
4,Good general wood seasoning book,"This book (which is British) does a good job explaining the basics of drying wood. While it is written for English woodworkers, the tables list common American woods too. I myself have some oak logs to saw up, and I am pleased with their ideas and plan to use many."
1,Wouldn't buy again.,"If you want to use this book to help teach a class on this subject get it, otherwise don't waste you're $$.WAY TOO LONG WINDED. Get to the point! Should have been 10 pages!I came across a better article in a fine woodworking magazine."
3,What was the point of this book?,"I had to read this book for summer reading, and didn't enjoy it. It was long, and somewhat pointless. I personally don't care about what happened to this random girl. It's all very nice and cliche but out of date. I am growing up now, and the WWII subject matter has never made more uninterested. Now I have to write a report about this book and I need to rave about how much I loved this wonderful novel."
5,PHP Security is a HUGE topic,"This book is essential for anyone starting out in PHP, but not only for them. It offers tips for almost any skill level, maybe you know some of the ways to keep your site secure but Chris really goes in depth on some of them.The code snippets are short, simple, but convey the point exactly as intended... and I also like Chris's method for validating tainted data, similar to a fisherman. If the fish is bad throw it back and the same goes for user input.I still have this book for reference and have lent it to a few people which resulted in them picking their own copies... all around a great resource."
3,Okay for Novices,"As far as technical books go, I liked this one. It really does get right to the point, and doesn't waste any time. But I do want to warn potential buyers that the book doesn't contain anything new to those who've been around the block a couple times. I'd say this book would only be informative to novice PHP programmers.I've been programming with PHP for a few years now, and even when I read a book aimed at novices I usually learn something, or I'm at least reminded of some issues that I hadn't thought about in a while. I can't say the same about this book. I read it front to back within an hour, and didn't learn anything new, nor will it provide any kind of reference for future projects.Overall I was disappointed, but that isn't necessarily the author's fault. I was just expecting something more in-depth."
3,Alright - not very meaty though,"Alright - not very meaty. Overall I'm glad I read it though, as I picked up some useful nuggets.==========Update 2006-12-30 - I'd like to bump this up to four stars. The book came in handy today - I used some code in it regarding session variables."
2,I hate this!,I shouldn't have even purchased this dumb cd...I really don't think she can sing.......Maybe it's because she SOOOOOOO fakes it! It just makes me really really really really mad! I really ate the way she squeaks her voice!And no offense...but I think her mom is soooo much better than she is! Britney needs to go to fashion school...Maybe they'll teach her a little something I like to call CLASS!
5,I own this single so i thought id review it for you,This single is an excellent start up for britneys second album.1.Oops i did it again(album version). This is a great song for anyone and is one of the coolest tracks on the album.2.Oops i did it again(instrumental) great to sing along to3.From the bottom of my broken heart(remix) I'd have to say this remix is as good as the original version.(Check out her voice! )4.Deep in my heart. This is off the baby one more time album and is very catchy and great to relax to. Lyrics are cool too!Over all this is a great single. EVERY britney fan should have it!
4,"Great stroller, once you figure out the front wheel issue","I have really enjoyed this stroller, and wouldn't have bothered to write a review except for the complaints about the swivel wheel. The issue is that when the front wheel has too much air, it is really bouncy since there isn't any weight on that wheel. If you keep that tire slightly flat, it won't bounce nearly as much. And the swivel wheel is definitely the best feature of this stroller."
3,Star trio keeps this one on track,"Based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel, and starring the mightily impressive trio of Kirk Douglas, Robert Mitchum, and Richard Widmark, this epic western should be a lot better than it is. Despite the endless parade of cliches, stereotypes, and the soap opera mentality that permeates the script, those three stars make this an entertaining, if slow, ride. What really calls attention to the film these days is the presence of Sally Field in her film debut. In 1967, the year the film was released, who would have ever thought that Field, then still known primarily as TV's ""Gidget,"" would go on to bag two Oscars, while only one of the superstar trio that heads the cast would take home the gold (and Kirk Douglas's Oscar was an honorary one at that)."
3,Handspring Bi-Fold Leather Case,"I purchased a case for my Visor Platinum to protect it from my tendency to drop it. I had already replaced one and was not in the mood to replace another. Little did I know that the case itself could damage the finish on my PDA. Although it it only cosmetic, it is damage none the less. The finish on the Visor emblem has rubbed off as well as a spot on the top front panel. Most of the damage appears to have been caused by the included paper pad. The paper also seems to have left a residue all over the leather interior of the case. Another dislike is that the case looks old and worn with very little use. I am currently looking to replace this case with a RhinoSkin Ti Slider for Handspring Visor which has a soft interior. The better to protect you from damage my pretty."
2,handle with care,"I bought this case because I liked how the visor snapped into place. However, within the first two months of use, both pieces had snapped off. First one snapped off when I was putting the visor in, and the second one snapped off when I dropped the case while it was open."
4,THIS IS NOT GANYMEDE !!!,"Hey, Amazon and readers, this is not the californian group called GANYMEDE, who released their first album in 2000.GANYMED (whithout the final ""E"") was an austrian disco group who released some records in late 70's. This is the re-issue of its first LP, which was originally released in 1978."
3,Better than the last Designer package,"Colors are not very faithful when painted on walls and have a rather limited palette. I could never find bookcases or adequate fireplaces. The roof is automatically generated so you can't really replicate your own roof,if you are doing a remodel,(unless it's really simple). Viewing tools are ok, measurement tools lack versatility. You can get a floor layout and view the 3D construction rapidly, but it really wasn't adequate to model my rather simple house. It's a good package if you only need to run some simulations to get rough ideas of what things might look like after a remodel."
1,Crappiest Airsoft Pistol Ever!,This airsoft pistol is just horrible. It broke during the first week I had it. Do not but this gun!
1,I'd like to point out,"18 fps. In case you don't know, fps is abreviated for ""feet per second"".To get a good grip on the firepower of this gun, start at one point. Take about 10-15 average steps. Turn around. Say the word ""one-onethousand"". Now race your word back to the origin. Chances are you beat your pellet back."
1,Let's add another complain because of our mistake.....,"We are all complaining about this piece of junk, crap or whatever we want to call it but, why did we buy it in the first place? I did buy it because of the LOOKS, almost like the real thing, that's about it and not for power or accuracy.[...]"
5,can't be beat....an illuminating product,"been using these for years....great to have around in the vehicle, bedside etc incase the 'big one' hits (earthquake out here). never had to shine one in anyone's eyes who comtemplated me harm but I hear these make good passive self defense devices as they buy you a few moments of your adversaries' blindness to run or make an impact. Product has great quality that has not changed for years. highly recommended."
2,burned hole in lens,This flashlight is super bright and that is the only reason I gave it 2 stars. The batteries will be used up in no time and you can't just change them over with convenient AA's or anything. This flashlight was expensive and no where near worth it. I haven't even looked to see what new batteries will cost because I will be trying to contact Streamlight about their product being defective. The light was so bright it burned a hole in the plastic lens in just a few uses. Such a waste of money really!!!!
4,24 Volt YardStick Trimmer,"Have used this a few times to trim & edge an average size residential lawn. Nice, sturdy product so far. Like with any trimmer, you need to take your time reloading the string. Battery lasts long enough to complete the whole job and then some. Four stars until I see how it lasts over time.American Gardener YS24 YardStick 10-Inch 24-Volt Cordless String Trimmer"
2,Not so great after all?,"I have this product and purchased it in May 2004. I have used it as a typical Florida homeowner throughout the years since I made the purchase, every weekend or so in the summer and hardly at all in the winter. I thought I was being green going battery powered. I never let it go completely dead and tried to keep a charge on the battery. Well, this is June 2007 and its dead. It works great while it works, good for light duty.I though it would have lasted longer. Haven't tried to find a battery yet but is it worth it? Seems disposable. So much for going green!FYI - I am now going to buy a gas combo...."
2,Good for a while....a short while.,"Well, let'e be fair....I really liked this when I first received it. Ample power and convenient. However, I lasted less than a year. The unit will not recharge and does not have enough power to trim. You have been warned."
1,0* Rating Would be better.,Would you believe it the battery is NO good after 3 times ofuse. Of course there's NO warranee for battery life.DO NOT BUY. The product weights a ton and GOD forbid youlost the spring used to hold cutting spool $.29+$.695 s&S.;You guessed it I lost the spring. So I ordered the spring and3 replacement spools $22.50. Put new spool in place- press thebuttons- no noise -nothing. Called tech support- explainedworks while mounted- does NOT work Unmounted- Answer You NEED-New Battery- SORRY batteries are NOT included in our warinteeDO NOT BUY PRODUCTd
2,American Gardener YS24 24-Volt YardStick Cordless Trimmer,"As a previous reviewer also experienced, the trim line cutter broke off the first time I used this product. I was hoping this product would do the job as it seems well built, but with the ease at which the line cutter broke off, I wonder. I have to now return mine and reconsider a gas powered unit."
1,"Amazon=Good, Trimmer=Bad","As usual, Amazon came through with an excellent price and prompt shipping.This product is the pits, though! It worked pretty well through the first charge but quit ten minutes into what should have been the second charge. After much inquiry and detective work, it was found to have ""bad batteries"", which wouldn't hold a charge and needed to be replaced. After reading the very fine print, we found that the batteries are NOT covered under the warranty and cost as much to replace as the trimmer initially cost. This after only 55 minutes of use.I've gone back to an electric corded trimmer after this experience. Like the title says, Amazon, good, trimmer, bad! I had to give it one star for the 55 minutes of use..."
3,"Decent so far, but not without problems","I've had this trimmer for about four months now. The fifth or sixth time I used it, it just quit wouking without warning. I checked the fuse and wires to the battery and they lookied ok, but I changed the fuse anyways....still didn't work. After reading some of these reviews, I saw a couple that said one of the wires came off the motor so I took the bottom half apart. Sure enough, the negitive wire was disconnected from the motor. A quick solder job and I was back in business.I really like this trimmer when it works, but the wiring mishap has spoiled my view on it. I'm guessing that there are more problems in its future due to its poor construction and/or quality control. I probably wont buy another American Gardener product again."
1,Broke on the first use,"This thing is poorly constructed. Within 20 minutes of using it, it basically self-destructed. I've used many weed wackers. It first impressed me as being underpowered and with a small cutting radius, but I got the hang of using it. Then the cord broke off (as they often do). I took off the spool, re-extended the cord, and replaced the spool. When I turned it on and the cord hit the cutter (which trims the cord to length), instead of cutting the cord, it merely grabbed it, which then bent the cutter out of the way, and then the cord proceeded to smash up the protective plastic shield. Perhaps this is a fluke, but it seems poorly constructed to me."
1,Complete frustration,The yardstick works fine (not great power but as much as you can expect from a cordless trimmer). After two years it stopped working so I ordered a new battery and charger. I have currently been waiting seven weeks for the replacement (and it's summer). I have had to call at least 4 times to find out the reason for the delay and as far as I know the excuse is back order (the date for delivery changes every time I call). I am beginning to wonder if it will ever arrive and perhaps they have no intentions of filling the request. Since this has been such an ordeal I would highly recommend not buying this product. As it is I am being forced to purchase another brand to get through the summer. Their customer service is awful - the very least they could do is inform the customer of the delay.
1,Company doesn't supply parts,I have an earlier model and can't get any parts for it -- not even a replacement spool. How can you trust that kind of company?
1,make sure to buy a replacement warranty if you get it,"I bought my Yardstick last summer, wanted to do a neater job with my yard. It worked OK for the 3-5 times that I used it last summer.Plugged it into the charger recently to get started on yardwork for this season. It went for about 45 seconds before it died. Charged it up for another day or so, took it out for another spin. Nothing happened, it is totally dead. What a waste of money. (I have to say, though, that this is the first product I've ever gotten from Amazon that was a piece of junk.) I contacted American Gardener via email as the yardstick was still in warranty, and they totally ignored my email. 0 points for customer service.If you want to spend the money to use it for one season only, go ahead. If you want to get more out of it than that, be sure to buy a replacement warranty or someone else's product."
2,not so good,"I don't believe this item is so good, I own one since 2005, just used couple of times (may be 10 times), now, the battery is bad, I have to either buy a new battery for YS-24 (around $25 plus $5 or more for shipping), or buy a wired model, like Craftsman 12"".I will go for the second one, I am not likely to buy battery for every five years (only use 10 times), and it is much heavy than the wired one, save your money, you can use the same money to buy two wired trimmer.I give it two stars since it did good work when it is functional, but, for its battery life, I have to cut three stars from it."
4,Great value,"Works as advertised. Excellent price and fast delivery. Great value. It is not the most powerful, but still meets my needs."
1,A worthless piece of cr@p!!!,"This is a total waste of time. Terrible ""acting""(lol), Aweful special effects, terrible lighting, direction, production, soundtrack, blood, did I leave anything out? Plot? What plot? I don't even believe this had a plot, so if it's there please someone point it out to me, but be warned you may be looking for a whil. I got this thinking it would be a silly gory cheezy horror film. What I got was a terrible ""film"" that was to bad to be good, and not cheezy at all, but I do this as a service to the rest of you, don't see this or any other film made by these people/company etc... A perfectly good waste of a dvd."
1,Bad Devil...Bad Devil!,"Poor script...even worse acting. What more could you want? As you watch this crap, you will experience the feeling that you've just lost about an hour of your life and you'll never get it back. One more blonde ballsy chick (who can't even deliver these crumby lines)to save the day. One more evil guy dressed in black. One more dumb couple who have not learned that quicky sex always leads to a terrible, shocking surprise. Flash back...flash forward...the ""plot"" can't decide where it wants to go. And, of course, a ""monster"" that looks like a cross between Alien and Elsie the Cow. All this movie needed was Tor Johnson with a big stick. Come to think of it, Tor Johnson would have probably passed on this script! Watch this crapola at your own risk."
1,Roger Williams,"Sorry, total crap. I bought this CD based on listening to 1 of R. williams songs and unfortunately we hated the CD. He adds too much flourish to really nice songs and winds up ruining the piece. I'll donate the CD to local thrift store and next time listen to more of the artist before buying the CD."
5,In memoriam of the pianist of the Presidents!,"October 8 2011 was the day in which the flame of life of Mr. Piano came to an end. Roger Williams was the referential cornerstone of the easy to listen music through the second half of the XX Century, and became a crucial gateway for others like Peter Nero, Henry Mancini or Richard Clayderman. Owner of a refined taste and free of pyrothecnical exhibitionisms a lo Liberace for instance, he truly elevated the level of this genre to unsuspected heights.Rest in peace!"
1,The worst electronic device I've ever had!,"The device was not working properly from day one. Garmin replaced the unit and I had the same problems with a new one. It was locking up without any reason, erasing saved data, battery did not last more than 30 minutes, was operating very slow, constantly loosing signal (outdoor!). I really wanted it to work, I liked the idea of PDA/GPS - but that was not the case. Garmin has terrible customer service!!! Late on e-mail responses, and try to call them - you will be on the phone for more than 30 minutes before you will speak to anyone. Most of the times they suggest to call them some other time. It you'd like to test your patients try this: 1-800-800-1020. As soon as warranty was over the iQue 3600 broke completely and I had to buy new one."
1,Ithaka,"Same deal here as everybody else. Was looking for cool music, not found it in this CD. For those looking to find anything about Ithaka try : valentim.pt/edicoes/nortesul/ae.htm"
1,Rip-Off,"This is pretty much of a ripoff. Who ever heard of a soundtrack without the songs played in the movie? It only has the filler music, some of which is good. But I have never seen this before, where they only include the score and not the songs. I bought a used copy for a buck plus 3 dollars shipping. Not even worth that. Don't buy."
2,A Mediocre Score which worked better in film than on CD,"The ""Replacement Killers"" score consists of two good themeatic tracks (""John's Theme"" and ""The Temple""), with the rest of the CD consisting of electric percussion and other strange background sounds. The lack of the good techno music from the beginning of the movie was a huge disappointment, the lack of which makes this album pretty mediocre ,even with the other two good themes. A score which worked better in the film than on CD, I recommend it only to the most hard-core movie and Media Ventures music fans."
1,Nothing is ever as easy as it seems!,"Well of course after ordering this CD I am angry. The techno tracks that make the movie explode are not on it. Even for a score this is bad. It just doesn't have enough variation to it. I have over 2,000 CDs in my collection and this is one I have to say won't be in there. If you looking for the song ""makes me wanna die"" It's by Tricky, and you should be able to find it here @ amazon.com"
1,Anybody find the Ithaka song??,"I can see that people have already posted the info on ""Makes Me Wanna Die"" and ""Keep Hope Alive"" but has anyone been able to find ""Escape from the City of Angels""?? This is the info from the credits: written by Darin Pappas & Pedro Passos, performed by Ithaka, courtesy of BCB Productions. All my web searches for all of this have turned up nil. Anyone successful? I'd appreciate the info."
2,ITHAKA FANS READ THIS,"Well, I wanted to get this CD for that Ithaka song ""Escape from the City of Angels"". Of course this song is not on the R.K. CD. Anyways, as all of you probably know, Ithaka CDs are hard to come by unlike the fairly common Crystal Method, Tricky, etc. I did some digging (even as far as talking to Ithaka's producer), and I found out that Ithaka is some sort of Portuguese band. Weird. If anyone does find their CD, tell me how you got it. LotsOLux"
1,A TOTAL LET DOWN,"I BOUGHT THE ALBUM FOR THE BEST SONG IN THE MOVIE ""ESCAPE FROM THE CITY OF ANGELS"" BY ITHAKA. NEEDLESS TO SAY IT ISN'T ON IT. ALSO FURTHER SEARCHES FOR THAT SONG HAVE PRODUCED ABSOLUTELY NOTHING."
3,Lack of an answer key is a detriment to self-study,"Alas, a major shortcoming of this particular book -- and quite a few otherwise superb Ancient Greek textbooks -- is the lack of an answer key for the included translation exercises. Some highly motivated learners cannot take a formal course or afford to pay a tutor. Most attempts to teach oneself ancient Greek from scratch probably ultimately fail, and the enterprise is already daunting (or foolhardy) enough without relinquishing the corrective feedback a live instructor -- or dead answer key -- provides. One almost suspects a conspiracy against would-be autodidacts on the part of the professional classics community!"
3,Now Available on DVD,This title is finally available on DVD from the Warner Archive collection (but for some reason not yet available on Amazon).
5,WELCOME TO THE GRINDHOUSE!!,This was the first double feature I have bought under this title and I must say it was the start of a new film viewing habit. I bought a 20 film box set labled Grindhouse as well and I couldn't even see the people in the films due to a horrible tape to dvd transfer. If you're looking for the quality to accompany the stink of such rotten awesome movie cheese then this is the Grindhouse to get with.
1,Brutal Man,"Here's a collection of bad reggae songs about all the usual suspects: Jah, Sensi,""Putti"". Sound quality is fine, but uninspired lyrics and performances drag down the beat. Its studio persperation without the insperation. Don't let these Shark imposters bite you. Honerable mention to Heptones."
4,Giant Tongue-bills,"I like these shoes, but I don't wear them for sports or anything like that. That said, the tongue-bill on these puppies extends probably 2"" farther than it should. I wear short socks most of the time and it started to take the hair off of the front of my shin. I folded them over instead of cutting them and that works just fine, but be warned: the tongue-bills are huge."
2,"Cheap, thin, awkward","It is a cheap soccer shoe with little support. the tongue extends about 1"" past the last lacing hole and digs into your ankle, one inch is also not enough for it to be bent back over the laces so it is sufficiently awkward and was enough for me to return the shoe. unfortunately no free returns so i'll be shopping elsewhere for my indoor soccer shoes. typically i wear a size 13, however these were about a size too large on me so i'd wear a 12 in this shoe. i have a pair of asics running sheos, lotto cleats and new balance cross trainers that are all 13."
5,Just the right product,"I was looking for a low profile sneakers, and this came to my mind. It's classic, looks good, looks sturdy and most of all, my feet are comfortable wearing these. Fast shipping by the seller, great job!"
2,Terrible Quality Control,I received my pair of size 13 shoes quickly after ordering. Upon trying my shoes on I noticed that the left shoe didn't fit at all like the right shoe. Upon inspection of the shoes I noticed that both shoe claimed to be size 13 as posted on their tongue tags. Next I put the shoes sole to sole and notice a dramatic size difference. The left shoe was 1 to 1.5 inches smaller than the right shoe. I don't know how this would happen and must be a problem with quality control with Adidas. I have bought other shoes from Adidas but have never had this problem. Buy this style with caution.
4,good compilation,"a very good collection that compliments sf sorrow and parachute(three of the tracks are on these albums) very well. the pretty things should be a part of every 60s fan's collection. there are a couple of weak tracks but in general this is a pretty good introduction to the group and the rarities on this cd include some of the pretty things best work: defecting grey(a truly awesome piece of english psychedelia), talkin' about the good times, cold stone, circus mind, and october 26 to name just a few.if you like early pink floyd, tomorrow, the move, and groups like that you'll like this stuff."
1,This is simply horrible,"Okay yeah this song is NOT all that. Her voice is obviously edited because everytime she performs this live she can't hit it and makes the whole song sound horrible. Not one of her best, and she needs to loose the fake blue contacts and quit dying her hair. Either that or quit lying that you're spanish because you aren't. Also it's pitiful that she's been with Carson, Eminem, and Fred in the span of 6 months that you were popular and she is so NASTY for posing like that on the Rolling Stone! Time to find another ""role model"" because this supposed one isn't doing a very good job of it!"
2,Doesn't stay on,Brightness is fine for me but I wasn't aware that you had to keep your finger on the button the entire time to keep it lit up. Very inconvenient
3,usefull,"Great light. Brighter than expected, and small head doesn't block view in small places. Very good in confined places under dashes and fits in shirt pocket so ready to use any time."
1,No parts available,"I have not used this product, but own the 18 volt version. I bought it at Menards about 2 years ago. The motor has burned out, and I cannot even find a website to order a part. Consider this a disposable item!"
3,Family,Great and influential band from the past. I hadn't heard these tracks for years but they have weathered well and the translation to CD is good.
5,My kids LOVE these videos!,"My boys, ages 1 & 2, absolutely love The Wiggles, especially Wiggly Safari with Steve Irwin (RIP). I even enjoy watching the videos with them. The music is very catchy...you'll find yourself singing the tunes all day long! Very entertaining!"
3,Good introduction to saltwater aquariums,Good intro. Helpful hints on setting up the aquarium for the first time. Could use more fish pictures and explanation of various types.
4,Clearly their best ever,"I won a copy of Revenge on legendary Radio Luxemburg, just as it was released in 1986. I listened to it a lot. A lot! And today, it still stands as the one album where Eurythmics did limit the electronic sound enough to make a great ROCK album.The brilliant songs nearly stumble over each other on the A side of the vinyl version. The atmospheric Missionary Man where Annie Lennox already shows the treasures of her exceptionally great voice. The simply good poprock song Thorn In My Side. The outrageous rocker When Tomorrow Comes. The beautiful, souldeepening, heartfelt ballad The Miracle Of Love.The B side, or the second half of the CD, makes the album fade a bit. But the quality of the first songs is so high that Revenge is worth a buy."
3,This Shoulda Been Better,"I was so pleased that editor-turned-director Stuart Baird found a collaborator in composer Jerry Goldsmith. However, unlike ""Executive Decision"", which contains a fantastic main theme to listen and sing to, ""U.S Marshals"" does not have any; only a five-note leitmotif is heard throughout this thirty-minute CD. 'Nuggets & Bullets' is a fine first track that presents that leitmotif, and it is better exploited in 'Following Chen'. There is an interesting piano effect in 'Eyes On The City', and 'Free to Go' closes the album nicely. The action music is quite interesting as well, with good suspense, most notably in 'Sinking Plane' and 'The Front Gate'.The reason I'm giving this album three stars out of five, is because thirty minutes is not much, especially since there is much more music heard in the movie. The lack of a solid theme is another letdown. At least the action leitmotif in this score is put to better use in ""Star Trek: Insurrection""."
3,Limited value,"Recently returned from a one week visit to Paris. I had taken the Marling Menu Master along thinking it would be invaluable in French restaurants. It turned that the menu-master is of very limited value. Here's why: #1 - upon closer examination of the menu-master I discovered that it was originally written in 1971 and has not been updated since. Well French cuisine has moved on quite a bit since 1971. #2 - surprisingly I found that about 80% of the French restaurants and cafe's that I visited during my week there had English language menus PLUS the staff had a decent command of English. By the way - this was true throughout my visit - in museums, stores and so on. English is truly becoming the world's primary second language. End result: while the menu-master provides some value - after all French cuisine has not changed 100% since 1971, it's value was quite limited. OK to have with you but most definitely not a requirement. Your choice."
2,"Just ""okay""","I had this book in Italian for a trip to Italy 2 years ago, and I must have a bad memory! The listings are by courses ie: Entre, appetizer, soup, etc. When you go to look things up - alphabetically would be best! Some dishes have meat, veggies, sauces, etc. all together. So it was nearly impossible to look up individual names of things, unless you know what catagory to check.The good part is the book is tiny enough to fit into an evening purse....but unfortunately, not very easy to use."
3,Not quite what I expected,This book serves as a good introductory to .NET Reflection. The book doesn't cover the Reflection.Emit class which is primarily what I was looking to learn about. I am some what disappointed.
4,Fascinating Movie!,"I wouldn't say I ENJOYED ""Leaves from Satan's Book"" as much as I thought it was very interesting to watch and was never bored. The movie is a silent film from the 1920s that reenacts famous historical scenes starting with the Bible and working its way up through the Spanish Inquisition, World War I, etc. in order to present scenes in which Satan was active in bringing down the human race. I was expecting a horror movie, but it was much better than that. Satan would never be obvious and the people he was tempting were seldom easily led. It's a complicated and beautifully-made and acted movie about the choices people make with the Devil waiting for them to err."
3,Battery hard to find,Not a bad little light but try and find this odd size battery in a pinch. It would be better if it were just a AAA size.
1,never received,"I ordered this item and never received it. However, Amazazon did refund my $. But still I would have liked to have gotten the item. I have not reordered."
5,thanks,"just as I ordered and wanted. I have other items of Jorge Cruise, so this went well with my collection."
5,UNA MUSICA CHE VA DIRETTA AL CUORE,"Una musica che va diretta al cuore !Certainly this is a music which touches directly your heart ;sweet , warm popular songs executed with a "" magic "" classic touch.The PianoDuo is fantastic and brings you directly into the heart of the song ; with a confidential tone makes you fill completely "" thrilled "" by this Vincent Rose's universal music.A must hear CD for your resting and romantic moments."
5,"It is a Manheim Steamroller Christmas CD, what else is there to say?",Who can not like a Manheim Steamroller Chrismas CD? Classic songs with great Chip Davis arrangements. Stack five of them in the CD changer and have fun.
5,Christmas Steamroller,"Now, having almost all of the Mannheim Steamroller Christmas CD's, I am extremely glad that I added this one to my collection. The innovativeness in the carols and Christmas songs make this CD truly remarkable. It provides a musical version of familiar songs that will warm up those Christmas memories and set the mood for a wonderful season."
2,"GOOD..........BUT,","While I like the music, I can't help but feel that Chip Davis might have gone to the well once to often. Chip has yet to re-create the mood, and feel of Stille Nacht from their first release. What made Mannheim special was their fresh approach to the classics. Now,alas it seems they have run out of material. After their first two releases, everything began to blend together. Where has all the creativity gone?"
2,Good For Meditation Or Sleep!,"I agree with the reviewer from FL. This CD was boaring! It was not the fun, high energy keyboard and brass that I thought it would be. Most of the songs have solo flute and strings. So far the best X-Mas CD's I've heard are:Joy To The World by John Williams and the Boston PopsB.B. King Christmas CollectionBurl Ives RudolphSo if you want something to help you sleep, I would say get this. Otherwise, try some other CD's."
1,Gave me foot problems,"Upon wearing this shoes for two weeks, they gave me foot problems. I thought they would get better after a few days so I kept wearing them. Now I need to go to the foot doctor because of the pain on my heels.I would NOT recommend this shoes for people who walk a lot at work or are on their feet for long periods of time."
1,Skechers Suck!,My Skechers were very poorly built. I had to return them after wearing 6 times. I now have to wait 4-6 weeks to have them replaced and they won't give me my money back to get different shoes.
1,MISTAKE,"IT SEEMS LOSING A RETURN TICKET FOR THIS COMPANY IS A MAJOR ERROR. I DID SO AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CLEAR THE MATTER WITH THEM SINCE. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I STILL HAVE THE SHOES AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR RETURNING THEM/"
4,Good Pair of Shoes,"Good pair of shoes overall. They look great and are comfortable to wear. One small issue I have found with these shoes is due to the polished look, scratches and nicks tend to stand out more than I have experienced with other Skechers shoes. The transaction was really smooth and the shipping was fast."
3,It is...okay,"Shoe looks a bit more boot like than I anticipated.Fit wise, it runs true to size. Top of the shoe rubs my ankle bone some and is uncomfortable; I hope that goes away over time as the shoe breaks in. I probably wouldn't buy this shoe again, but will wear it until they are worn out."
4,Open mindedness and knoweledge,"I think that the reader from Lemont has some serious thing to consider. Obviously he/she has some large problems with racial issues. Moving on, I think that this book was very interresting and shows the hardships that blacks had to live with. We may think that our lives now are very difficult, but how would you like to go for days without eating? Most os us can't imagine it. Wright did a great job with this book and I strongly recomend it to anyone who has an open mind and would like to read a very intriguing book."
3,Must read.,"Must read. However, there are sections that flow with sections that lack coherence. Gives people that read this novel a true depiction of the hopelessness many blacks felt during Jim crow south."
4,Hearing Wright's Life and Our Own,"Peter Francis James's performance of Richard Wright's autobiography brings many of its aural qualities our ears, qualities we may not notice in a silent reading of the book. These CDs enable both the visually impaired and the sighted to enjoy Wright's classic and to ponder why after sixty-two years the book still provides insights about American culure."
2,WHAT IS IT ?/,"uhmm well ive seen the reveiws listed but one question still racks my brain... whay type of book is this ? is it a book that consists of multiple tales of black people or it it one book that comcludes a story of ""A Black Boy"" ???"
5,I doesn't take a lot of words to say how great this book is.,"I read this book right after I got out of school. I saw the reviews and just wanted to say many of the reviews are too wordy. Blackboy is considered seminal reading for anyone seriously interested in the African American experience. The novel Native Son made Wright famous, but beyond any doubt, Blackboy is a super-classic novel. It is the best novel written by the one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century. Too much is made of Wright's aversion to black women and it colors much of the comentary on his life and writings. Wright was above all else, a tremendous writer and this is his best work."
5,Black Boy,"I had previously read this very important book and wanted a hard copy of my own for reference. The volume I purchased was as described and in good condition with some wear to the dust jacket. Otherwise, it was in excellent shape."
3,Where's The Fight,"I liked this book, and I really wanted to give it a five star.I gave it a three star because I felt Richard wright let me down page 210.All through the book he's a rebel. He pulls out a knife at his aunt and a razor blade on his uncle.He had me believed through the whole story he was a man ready to die to defend who he was and what he stood for, but when it came to the two white boys, Pease and Reynolds, he fold, rather stand up, he quit his job.I wanted to read about a man who redefined the world and Richard Wright did not do that.when Richard went out into the real world, around white people, his tail between his leg, to be that was the biggest down fall about this story.I felt like who Richard wright was in the beginning of the book down once he started working. But other than that I loved the book. I would highly recommend it."
3,"Good history, but somewhat ""dry""","An excellent historical book. I had to read it for a history class in college. The reading can be ""dry"" but portarys an excellent picture of life during the time the book was written. Some of it will shock the reader."
5,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!,This book is very interesting. It lets people know the life of Richard wright. It shows how life was hard for African American people in the 1920s and 1930s. I think that every person that reads this book will have a different view of life. They will see how good life is now for them. I know meny kids dont read as much but this book is highly recommended for teens.
3,Bright Light - Working beyond 90 days?,"Having used another ""high-end"" rechargeable (600 Lumens) flashlight, a law enforcement colleague of mine recommended the Ultra Stinger. Great white light, long distance illumination on a dark wooded trail while walking my Springer Spaniel. Charge appears to last as the product details indicates - so don't risk it dimming to dark in the dark!OK...the bad news. Product had stopped working after 90 days! Charge is working, but Flashlight is dead! Warranty?I am investigating because the replacement bulb and battery (OEM) are very pricey. I do not trust a knock-off battery model made in China as I saw advertised. Needless to say, I am disappointed. Purchase was from Amazon. Any recourse?"
5,Strealight Ultra Stinger,"This is a very rugged and bright flashlight, i use it to do home inspections and it works very well. Also, I did have some kind of problem with the first one I received and Amazon's exchange process was great! I had the replacement the same day I mailed the defective one."
1,Junk!!!,"I invested the money based on the reviews but it failed on me after only a couple months and, even after repairs, failed again and has been re-assigned to the garbage can. Very disappointed as I expected to get what I had paid for!!"
3,same problems,"steamlight battery: not holding full charge-clean top battery contacts with pencil easer head. light output weak with fully charge battery--clean battery, two years is life of battery, switch light holder needs to be removed and cleaned. blub sticking to O-ring in len--swiss army knife awl blade use to remove material from red O-ring. len, plastic crazed or cracked-- factory replacement--FREE--switch rubber cover torn--FREE factory replace--NOT like the MAGLIGHT cost four dollers. These are common problems for all Streamlight POLICE/ metal lights. Factorys will repair and replace for FREE lifetime."
4,"Too short and loses the ""ominous feeling"" of the movie","I read the book, watched the movie, and I really liked the way the music in the movie gave it that evil bass overtone...The CD seems to focus on the ""rememberable"" trebel ""highlights"" of the movie soundtrack ... and thats it.I guess what i wanted was the long bass sections of the soundtrack (like the scene in the movie where Norman is alone staring at the sphere).So bewarned, it doesn't quite catch the moody ""dark ship"" feeling in my opinion."
3,Worthy of moniker if a bit flat,"3 1/2A few tracks are in league with Soft Machines better work (try not to be wowed by the dazzling opener) but some of the disc in comparison feels like relative filler. Thankfully some of the weaker parts find redemption through Holdsworth's superb guitarwork, as fluid as it is perceptive."
1,Too Dim and the Numbers Not Uniformly Lit,"I should have returned this out of priniciple, but it was cheap and it barely suffices. But previous digital clocks can be easily read from 10 feet. Not this one. Depending on its mood (and mine) I get a lock on the time maybe half the time."
4,Very readable description with complete construction info.,"Whether you intend to build the transceiver or not this book provides a complete description of a modern, state of the art radio. Randy discusses each circuit in detail explaining the operation and in many cases the reason for his choice of circuits. Complete details of construction are explained with a parts list, schematic, circuit board template and parts layout. The circuits are broken down into small workable units and in many cases can be tested before final assembly. This ""test as you build"" method could eliminate extensive trouble shooting when the project is completed. The writing style is clear, orderly, conversational and, occasionaly, humorous. This is an advanced project, however, there are many building tips and suggestions that anyone, beginner or advanced, will find helpful. Missing are the specifications of the completed transceiver (the power output is 50 watts) and the author's call sign (WI5W)."
3,"the pictures were beautiful, but the limited information was a disappointment","the pictures were beautiful, but the limited information was a disappointment. I Was expecting more information. Not too good for a research project."
5,heavy....f***ing...METAL!!,"watch them die are bringin back old school thrash and aren't lettin anything get in their way with this album,it just pummels you with great riffs and vocals,like really angry lyrics with even better riffs?pick up this album NOW!!!you're gonna love it!"
2,Is this what passes for thought provoking?,"I enjoyed God's Debris to a degree just because it was interesting to play out the logic and think ""outside the box."" But the follow up is just plain silly in parts. The characters are ridiculous caricatures and the philosophy is shallow and sophomoric. Almost nothing is believable in the entire book.If you think the phrase ""If God Is So Smart, Why Do You Fart?"" is profound and life changing than this book is for you."
1,Missing,Still have not received this book. I have no clue where it is??? I have been checking on it for over a month now and stiill have not received it.
5,New to the Mannheim Steamroller,"I had heard of these folks, but had never paid much attention to them. I have now, though, and they have the most powerfull sound I have ever heard. I swell with the music until I feel my heart will fly away with it. Thank you, Steamroller...you have a new fan."
3,What a Shame This Wasn't Released 5 Years Earlier!,"It's a crying shame that Mannheim Steamroller's live Christmas album wasn't released in the early 1990s (i.e. between the 2nd and 3rd studio releases), instead of 1997. One only has to skim the track listing to see why. The album is loaded with relatively weak efforts from ""Christmas in the Aire"" (""Pat-a-Pan,"" ""Rudolph,"" ""Gagliarda,"" etc.) while Chip's masterpiece ""Fresh Aire Christmas"" is almost totally unrepresented. Someone was asleep at the switch on this one."
4,missing content,"This is a perfect cd with a few minor issues. The songs sung by Marilyn Monroe, are not her. I'm not sure who is singing them, but it's not her. If you want the songs that she sings in ""There's no business like show business"", then find Marilyn Monroe's cd: Anthology on i-tunes. You will be satisfied with the songs from that album."
3,Why not in black or dark wood?,this picture looks like it's exactly what I'm looking for...except for the color? I would love it if this exact model would come in black! I don't want to have to pay $130+ for it & then have to sand it & paint it myself!
5,Great cymbal stand!,"Actually, I don't know why people are rating this cymbal stand with 2 stars (on average). I've bought several. They do the job. No complaints. Telescoping stands are more versatile, but these vertical stands do the job just fine. Enjoy!Jim"
2,"Essentially a pamphlet, not a book","Hugely disappointing if you're expecting a scholarly concordance. This is a brief list of a few obvious words that appear in the New American Bible, with references to Chapter and Verse where they appear. ""Holy"" is included. ""Mouth"" is included. ""Mustard"" or ""mustard seed"" is not."
1,"The characters of this book deserve each other, both are bad","But the hero is especially slimy. Every action he takes is more low-down and sleazy than the one before. I couldn't believe anyone would find this character romantic, much less want to write about him. I am mystified. The heroine isn't much better. She isn't intelligent enough to scramble eggs, something I knew how to do by the time I was eleven. And she is a Republican activist, working for and sleeping with a crooked, anti-choice politician who is running for president. YUCK. Politics should be left out of romance novels."
1,Don't Buy!,I purchased Two of these and neither one worked. Wasn't able to use at all. I guess that's why they are so cheap You are better off buying the real thing.
1,This isn't what I ordered,When I ordered a headset it was supposed to be the pro. ones and I was pretty disappointed with them.
1,Junk!,Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. Thats really all there is to say. Wont even work. It worked for like five seconds then nothing.
3,"Cheap, flimsy but worth periodic replacement!","OK, with pre-teens and young teens one must expect that fragile electronic accessories will need to be replaced regularly. Thank heavens for these useful headsets! They are cheap and it shows, but I have no reason to get upset when they wind up destroyed. I keep several replacements around for the next breakage ""accident"" and never regret the choice to go with these over the much more expensive, slightly sturdier variety which would ultimately wind up just as broken! Amazon makes this a no-brainer!"
3,Good but.....,"So I bought this headset like six months ago and it's a pretty good headset for 4 bucks. So if you don't want to spend more than that, get this one. However, I only gave it three stars because today's the ear speaker stopped working and I could only hear from the tv. At first I thought my Xbox was being weird so I turnned it off and back on. Still didn't work, so I wiggled the jack a little, still nothing. Then I arrived a the conclusion that the speaker was broken because my friends could still hear me out of the mic.Overall, I'm pretty happy with it, considering I paid only 4 bucks. But the headset part where it goes on your ear is not comfortable at all and after an hour of having it on, it starts to hurt. I figured out a way to make it not hurt as much, and that's all the placement of it on your ear.Now I just decided to buy the actual Xbox headset. So 6 months is still pretty good for 4 bucks, but I think the Xbox headset will be better."
3,good value,It works well but is defintitely built for kid size heads. Not super comfortable but it isn't a high end item.
2,360 headset,if you need a back up headset this is great i use them when i dont feel like using my turtle beaches so i wanted to go cheap. but they arent very comfortable the plastic is not flexible at all no its tight on my head but i do have a big head lol. you might get lucky if it fits your head but i would not recommend them for everyday use. o and one more thing the mic is alot more sensitive than a Microsoft one so you really cant have your game sound up to loud it will pick it up
2,Poor quality of the top!!,"Here's the simple deal on this one .... Superb sole. It is super thick and you feel awesome. But, the top sucks. The leather is really fake and will start showing cracks very soon. Of what use is a shoe that looks like crap from the top but is essentially still functional because the sole is great?? Gave it to the SALVATION ARMY!!!"
3,Beverage Glasses,"The picture of the Christmas tree has gifts under it that are smaller than the original glasses and the picture is higher up on the glasses. Will make do because I am not paying postage to return them, besides I had to use them as were."
4,Mercury Rising by John Barry.,"Although it has simularities to ""Dances with Wolves"" several of the tracks from Mercury Rising are arguably among John's best work. Just about any track that includes the name ""Simon"" will feature Barry's theme for the young, autistic boy. Simon's theme is really what makes this soundtrack superb! I'd say the track that does it the best would be ""I'm a Friend of Simon's"" towards the end of the CD. As with nearly all film scores, this CD does have tense moments but I've always found these to be the least-likeable parts of the score (i.e. they're not beautiful). Personally I think this is definitely a good score to buy be aware; since it has been long out of print it's a little pricy!"
1,Has some serious flaws.,The worst flaw is that the vibrations makes the pole turn. The catch that makes it longer or shorter doesn't tighten enough to hold it steady. Trying to turn the handle with it to make the blade straight as I'm cutting makes my back hurt. After a full charge I was able to cut only 3 or 4 3-inch branches before the battery was completely dead. I don't recommend this product.
3,It's not what I wanted,"These cds were not what i wanted. The cds would be good for very young children. I ordered 2 and opened 1 ( I gave that one to the public radio station here in Juneau for their show for children ""We like kids"".I did get what i wanted thuough MP3, I want a Hippoptamus for christmas, by Gayle Peevey. Only Gayle Peevey would do."
4,Right on,"Great book, as an American living in France, I really felt that this book was right on. I could really identify to everything. Laughed a lot, but skipped a few parts that were boring to me. Ted S. has an amazing amount of knowledge about France and current culture, although at some points in the book it seems he's just showing off about all the nitty gritty things he's learned and the big words he knows ! I just bought the second book, 'sacrés américains' but haven't yet read it. Warning - it's not mentioned anywhere on Amazon, but this book is written in FRENCH !"
3,GOOD SCENERY,"The movie theme is old and out-dated, but then again so is the movie. The story is bland, the love interests boring, and the sound very poor. However, the scenery and costumes were colorful and interesting, and the animals fun to watch. This movie should probably be placed at the bottom of movies to re-watch, or relegated to the college class entitled ""The History and Improvement of the Motion Picture."""
3,Great game but kinda dissapointing,"As far as Ive expect from a new Command and Conquer game, lots of new featurs and units, etc are all there. Except one very dissapointing aspect was the graphics. It may look very appealing to people because it does look nice...but its the same memory taking graphics as every RTS game out these days. I loved command and conquers unique slick graphics they had but not EA has to mess that up gave in to that empire earth kind of thing which i never really liked :\."
2,A Loyal Customer and Avid Fan of the C&C Series,"I have waited for this game for months and when it finally arrived it was in my PC not three days after being released. Besides to number of items you must have to make the game run smoothly like the correct chipset, the game locks up my PC every time I play it. I have followed the instructions, made sure I have the correct software and hardware but nothing makes it stop locking up. I have a brand new 200 machine, 7500 video card and sound care well past the minimum requirements. The game is very enjoyable but HIGHLY unstable. Be ready for a few hours of aggrevation."
4,Very Good game...but...,"Ok, to start this review I just wish to say one thing, the graphics in this game are amazing. I have seen several reviews saying the game is a serious resource hog on some very high end machines, however I am running an AMD Athlon 900Mhz machine with an ATI Radeon 9600 pro 256 MB graphics card. Not to mention the fact that I only have 256 MB of Ram. I'm experiencing no slow downs at all. I thnk the game might have a bit of a problem with the GeForce chipset but I haven't checked in to that yet.Next, they did a very good job on the gameplay end, aside from a few pathfinding errors, but that's why developed the waypoint system. They did a good job of balancing the U.S. and China, but the GLA does not live up to the standards i would have expected, the units are weaker in offense and defence. I would imagine that's do to my lack of experience."
3,Quite dissapointing,"Just before i played it i was relly looking faward to playing Generals. i liked all the other commander and conquer games like red alert 2. I think the graphics let it down the most, especially when i found out it needed a g force graphics card 3, i thought the graphics would be amazing, (i'v sin better)All the units are literally the same and on the skirmish levels, u can only get three teams.But it was alot more realistic, with money, aircraft, buildings bin built and of course explosions. I also liked the general abilities with stuff like computer hackers and upgrades to units, my favourite is black Napalm fof the migs and Dragon tanks. The game also takes up a huge amount of room.If u want my advive, i would pass on generals.P.S, i do hav a g force 3 graphics card."
5,"This is a great game, but don't work on win 7","I brought this game to play it on my win 7 ultimate system. The shipping was fast and professional, and little to no stratches, worked perfectly well during installation; however, the problem is in my operating system. It's not allowing me to open my favorite game to play it. Not even the world editor works. I tried a few times and just gave up. Great game if you have XP, Vista or windows 2000/ME, but not for Windows 7. The system won't allow it. I will absolutely purchase from this seller again. They are awesome :D, however, I do have to return this item to get the first decade C&C because dispite the comments above, I still cannot play my game. Don't let my review discourage anyone from buying this game but be warned that you cannot play it with any window 7 operating System. It just won't happen, Prove me wrong if you want to. Dispite this warning, do buy from this seller they are great."
5,Worthy Buy!,"I don't usually purchase computer games, (usually borrow from friends, play for a week or two until I get tired, and give back), however, Generals is an exception, having been a fan of the Command and Conquer franchaise, this was a natural step, the new units are great, the gameplay is well polished, the minor bugs have been fixed in the subsequent patchs, all in all, if you're looking for a good RTS, or have a hankering for modern warfare, look no further"
4,Great game but wrong plot,"The best RTS game so far. I got a soupped up computer & the game is just amazing. Incredible soundtrack. BUT one thing that I have a problem with: the story. In this game, China is going after the terrorist org (which they attacked China for no reason)while the USA don't want to be part of. In the real world, it is COMPLETELY the opposite: the USA goes after the terrorist org while China is a country that doesn't wage war."
4,strategy game of the not so distant future,"My friend loaned me this game a week ago and, hey, it is really quite good. The theme of this strategy game is, in some ways amazingly modern. There are three groups that you can be, the Chinese, the US, or a mid-eastern terrorist group known as the GLA. It is quite simple really, both in difficulty and understanding, if you are the terrorist then you get to use weapons from suicide bombers to scud launchers to fight the Chinese and/or the US. If you are the Chinese or the US then you fight the terrorist with the latest in weaponry from stealth bombers, to tactical nukes, to Overlords, the mother of all tanks.You also get promotion bonus points, which lets you choose to use artillery barrages, carpet bombs, or EMPs. You can also get tactical upgrades with the promotions. So whether you are destroying the terrorists and their bases or launching scud missiles at the Chinese/American allies, you are sure to enjoy this simple, but good modern war game."
3,It grows on you,"Very nice product for what it does, but it takes some getting used to. First the good. Appears very durable and has a nice feel to it when carrying. Excellent for inside a house, such as during a power outage. The white light is very diffuse and wide angle illuminating a large area or an entire room.Now for the not-so-good. The on switch in at the end of unit - inconvenient. The LED light is very different from the traditional flashlights and may not be what you expect. The light is not focused. Used outdoors, the diffuse light will illuminate I found relatively good up to only about 30 feet. The beam cannot be focused from a diffuse pattern to a sharp compact beam. My mag light is definitely better for outdoors.Overall, nice product but it serves a niche. Definitely not the only flashlight I would want - or need - to own."
4,"Bright, bright, bright light",The beam of light this thing generates is awesome. Just received it so I can't speak to the durability or battery use. The reflector around the LEDs was chipping when I opened it to install the batteries so that is why I've rated it a 4 star. Nice size and it comes with a clip for your belt. A key chain loop is included too.
2,Which version is this?,"I didn't buy this score. I bought a Shirmer Don Giovanni. I still can't figure out what this is. At least one reviewer says you get the vocal score but most of the others seemed to have gotten the full score. I wanted the vocal score a couple months ago but now I also want the full score. What is this?I notice that the preview pages only contain the pages with straight text. This is not very helpfull. I would want to see how the music is laid out on the page. Ricordi scores, for example, are often better set than Schirmer. I don't know about Dover."
3,"Slightly one-sided story, arguments not realisitic","I was expecting some vitriolic remarks, and got them. However, Nader did not appear to want to see the business-side of the story: in those days, safety did not sell. Selling safety was/is a 'nineties phenomenon"
5,A guitarist's guitarist,"From a fellow guitarist's perspective, this album is a masterpiece. The well-placed silence between mesmerizing, shimmering guitar licks is deafening. Otis is masterful at telling a story or setting a mood with the confluence of his anguished singing, espressive guitar-playing, and impeccable timing. What sets him apart from other, perhaps flashier, guitarists, is the patience he shows while telling a story---i.e., the spaces between guitar playing, the patience in holding a note. His phrasing on the guitar is simply hypnotic. One of his secrets is that he puts on a silky-smooth vibrato while deftly bending the string---a difficult task for many.I wish more current blues musicians played like this---less busy noise going-on,...His other indispensable studio album is ""Cold Day in Hell,"" which has even sparser, intense playing, and perhaps a better, upfront tone.For a great LIVE album of Otis, I would suggest TOPS, or else LIVE IN EUROPE."
4,Enjoyable format,"Liz Curtis Higgs presents the ""bad girls of the Bible"" in an enjoyable easy to read format you will remember. makes a great summer bible study as people can miss a week and not fall behind."
3,Not a bad book but very basic.,"We used this book for a Bible Study group and it seemed elementary. It also seemed that the author created issues that did not exists. I think that the author is very talented and she has done her research but she brought to mind some feminist issues that I am not so sure were necessary.She did bring to mind some people that we do not think about in the bible and I liked the challenge of researching some minor characters that we never think about. I think part of this study is too basic for an advanced group looking for a deep study. However, because of the feminism I would not recommend it for a more basic group. It definitely provided our group with many good talking points although most of them were about how we disagreed with the authors point of view.(I am not sure feminism is the right word, it just seemed that she brought up arguments that didn't need to be had.)"
4,Great for young Women's Church Group,"We are currently using this book in our church's Y.A.W.N. (Young Adult Women's Network). The group is having so many great convertations about the book. The modern day stories about the women are set up in a way that makes is easy to understand the Bible story about the ""Bad Girl"". We truly enjoying this book and will find it hard to top for our next study.Bad Girls of the Bible and What We Can Learn from Them"
4,Well written,"These vignettes of bad girls from the Bible are well written, humorous and thought provoking."
3,good heavy duty swings,"They are good heavy duty swings. My only complaint is the cost. I found swings that were about as heavy duty at Home Depot that were less expensive and of course, had no shipping cost. I could have saved around $25 for the two swings if I had just purchased them at Home Depot."
4,"Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins","Although this is not my favorite writing style, there is no doubt that Nabokov was a highly gifted stylist. This is the story of a middle-aged man and his obsession with a teenage girl-child named Delores. The eroticism is often understated and subliminal but no less intriguing and disturbing, as the first-person narrator reveals this relationship and doomed secret infatuation with the girl.David Rehakauthor of ""A Young Girl's Crimes"""
2,not the same look,"the book itself, meaning the contents was correct, but the cover was not as neatly designed as the one in the picture shown. I was expecting a nicer version. Though I did buy it slightly used and I suppose they are older copies."
2,Not My Style,I read 187 pages of Lolitta and just did not feel like finishing it. Perhaps one day I will take it up again but for now I really did not like it. Ie appeared that the author wanted to impress the reader with his vocabulary.cj
3,Climaxed (no pun intended) Too Early,"This story fell apart once it reaches its climax with way too many pages left to go. The second half of the story is far too bizarre, which is saying a lot given the subject matter of the novel as a whole. I will give Nabakov credit for tackling a tough topic ahead of his time and really getting into the mind of a distasteful individual, but I did not feel that the novel lived up to its hype. A very depressing tale."
3,Unparalleled Prose...,"Nabokov's Lolita is a master-class in the artfully composed sentence. I'm not sure I've read a book that was written with such sparkling, perfectly evoked prose. In addition, Nabokov channels the perverse soul of Humbert Humbert in such a way that the character seems to have really written the purported memoir. Unfortunately, all of these overwhelmingly positive attributes did not add up to a great reading experience. After a time I found the actual plot dull, as the tireless obsession of Humbert became grating, and the book sort of unravels in the second half. Lolita then, is a book I admired, but that I didn't particularly like or enjoy."
1,Pretentious dribble.,"How the hell can anyone consider this a great novel? It addresses no deep themes, has no dramatic tension and no moving or even likable characters. ... Apart from the illicit sexual theme - which you can get more and better of in beeline novels if that is your sort of thing - who cares what happens to either of them?After reading this I began to understand why Nabokov was so critical of Dostoyevsky - it was sheer jealousy. Because one page of Crime and Punishment contains more drama and pschological insight than anything that detached, arrogant and superficial snob ever wrote."
2,Didn't do anything for me,"This book wasn't badly written--I just did not see what was so great about it. I had to read it for school and would not have finished except I had no choice. I simply did not see much of a plot, and what was there did not hold my attention at all. Humbert's character was slightly fascinating in that he was so twisted, but things like that just do not interest me. When I put the book down, I was left with a creepy, unresolved feeling (yikes--there are actually people like that out there!), not to mention being fully relieved that I was finished with that book forever!"
5,Great read,I enjoyed Nabokov's writing style. Lolita is a little unbelievable at times but many of her behaviors reminded me of thoughts or behaviors from when I was an adolescent. Ah the plight of prepubescent/pubescent girls...It was also very interesting to see Humbert Humbert's struggle throughout the whole ordeal. It is obvious that he loves Lolita and honestly wants her to be taken care of yet he just can't help himself.
2,Lolita,"The writing is excellent, but I can't get past the character's morals. The author is glib and funny - at times, but his character is hard for me to understand or appreciate. HH is adrift in a sea without a sail, rudder or keel. I'm sure the author is providing us with a life lesson, but HH just hit a reef."
2,I Felt Soiled After Reading This,"Nabokov is a genius. His mastery of prose is without peer. His words dance, they sing, they cavort.I just wish he had written another story, instead of this miserably depressing tale of a crazy pedophile on a cross-country raping spree with a twelve year old girl.I guess I am not one of the ""wise, sensitive, and staunch people who understood my book"" which Nabokov writes about in his condescending 1956 afterward."
5,lolita is a young girle and she make a relationship with man,"a young girl lolita , she love her teacher and make a relationship with him , he was a bove 40 years old , when she was a nymph with 12 years old"
5,The most talked about book of the century....,"Never before have I witnessed such a struggle between a man's desire to be socialy acceptable... Humbert manages to, between bursts of obsession-driven rants about Lolita, defend his position with vigor. A fascinating look into the mind of a man driven mad with his passion for a girl the world won't let him have."
5,THE BEST AMERICAN NOVEL EVER WRITTEN,"For years I did not read LOLITA because of the subject matter. WELL!! Because the new film of the book came out last year I bought and read it, and the result is that I believe it is the best American novel ever written, albiet it was written by a Russian expatriot--and English was his second language! This book is almost poetic. It is very funny. It is a love story. It is a detective story. It is a psychological study. It is a travelogue of the U.S. backroads inthe '50s. It is a criminal's confession. It is a legal defense. It is the story of a pedophile. It is all of the above, and still is very sad. I loved it, and almost re-read it as soon as I finished the last page. Instead, I bought Nabakov's bio and read ABOUT it and about him. Then, of course, I had to read his other books. . . He was truly a genuis, and quite an entertainer."
4,"""I have to do this because I love you.""","The greatest ""love"" story ever? Come on. Pedophelia is about power and control, not ""love."" This is a great book, but let's not kid ourselves on this one thing."
5,A really inspirational read!,"Barry Shainbaum has not only captured some amazing people with a photo lens but he has captured the idea of hope and love for our world with their stories of integrity. From Nelson Mandela, Rick Hansen and Dr. Maya Angelou to a group of elementary school kids who saved a local mountain from coal mining destruction.It's not just a book of pictures. It's a book with heartfelt goals, ideas and inspirational messages that motivate one to be committed to making the world a better place.A great gift for the heroes in your world and for one for yourself!"
1,Poor Product,"I purchased the Tersano drinking unit a few years back. The first issue I had was that it was not working properly[unit would not dispense water] after 1 year and the company replaced the caraff.This issue happened again and they replaced the base part. The main issue was that the main unit would leak water and not work properly. The unit worked well for 1 year but fell apart after that. When I called customer service, they mentioned that I had to purchase a new unit. I did that and I had the same leaking issue from the base of the unit [there would be a puddle of water] and it would not dispense water from the base into the caraff.Love the idea but do not believe in their quality since they moved their manufacturing of the product to China. If you buy this product it will work for a while but will stop wortking after a period of time. I would not recommend it to my family or anyone else fro that matter.Not a good investment.Mike L"
5,Most affordable,"I ordered the Lotus Water Treatment System from Amazon about 6 months ago after I read a review that said Brita was close to useless and cleaned virtually nothing out of the water. The Tersano unit is expensive up front, but the filters last a long, long time. I am not sure what the other reviewer is talking about with ozone being released, because i smell/detect nothing from this unit. I have been using Tersano Lotus Sanitizing System for years for my fruits and vegetables and for cleaning my home. Everything from this company is worth every penny you invest."
5,Easy to use and tastes great!,"I have the Lotus Sanitizing System and was very impressed with the unit and the company. I have two children so we go through a fair amount of bottled water, between taking one to school everyday and all the sports practices. I always hated buying bottled water. Paying for water? Anyway I decided to try the Lotus Water Treatment system and am very glad I did. The system is extremely easy and quick to use and the water tastes very, very good. I highly recommend it!"
3,Be Careful,"I didn't take time to read all of the other reviews before buying this product, so I don't know if anyone else has mentioned that this unit does NOT remove Fluoride from your drinking water. We are lucky enough to live in an area where this rat poison is not added to our water supply, but many areas of this country do have it in their drinking water and it should be removed if healthy water is your concern.This is a shame because the thing seems to be ok otherwise, except for a poor water pump which I did notice mentioned by other people."
5,Awesome Service,Product was good and got it fast It was exactly like the picture and description. The experience was very easy and simple
5,LOVE IT,"I have other Mountain tshirts and they are GREAT!!! They was well, super comfortable and where else can you get such great art work?? I love them. The shipper was also great, got them earlier then expected!"
3,Hilariously Funny!!!,"This book is funny and frightening at sometimes. It confronts you with the doubts of an westernized Indian girl in a funny way.I can't say a lot about it, but I can say you must read it."
1,Vitriol with a Hateful Agenda,"Totally fictional portrayal of Haredi Jews as cold, violent male chauvinists. The many obvious mistakes in the prayers and rituals give away the fact that probably nobody involved in the production of the film ever had any direct contact with Haredim. The result is a crude caricature based entirely on the negative and ignorant stereotypes secualar Israeli society has about Orthodox Jews. Watching this film feels like sitting through an anti-semitic rant."
3,heart breaker,"I just saw this movie tonight. All I can tell you is it was a heart breaker. Rivka and Meir had a loving marriage until the Rabbi ruined it. Malka was doomed from the start. Her husband was a disgusting, frightening, sick man. The wedding night scene was a nightmare for Malka. This man was an animal. Absolutely an uncaring lover. He never heard of the word foreplay? Guess not. He was extremely rough on their first time lovemaking. (she was a virgin) It turned my stomach. The ending will definitely call for tissues. This movie was not rated... but deserves an R. Not for teens, or children."
1,Really wooden,"The dialogue creaks and churns, the 'spark' between the couple flickers and dies, and the two people are really not very likeable. James is wooden, a duke who does what all day? They are supposed to be betrothed for two months, yet the supposed sizzle is contained for that long? And they hardly know each other, we never get to see his family?The whole blackmail thing is predictable and trite.James' cruelty is inexusable, as is his lack of explanaion to his wife.The whole latter half of the book is a tragedy of errors and i ca't honestly say I know enough about these characters at the end to be interested in them enough to figure out why they fell in love. Or care.Her second book is a lot better, sexy and witty. This one was passable, a tried and tested formula that in this case has the emotional intensity of a log."
3,Eh...this one just didn't do it for me.,"The heroine is supposed to be a feisty American. She is certainly headstrong and tough in the beginning. But after she marries the hero, she becomes this wet noodle. She apologizes for things that HE did wrong and simpers in his presence. Not my idea of a tough American gal.The heroine basically begs for sex from this guy knowing he doesn't love her. She is just the epitome of a woman with no self-respect.The hero is so emotionally detached that it is hard to even like him a little. He finally comes around in the end, but by that time you dislike him so much you don't care anymore.The subplot about the Madame from France was silly, but I guess the story needed some spice.Definitely not my favorite, but I guess it was okay."
4,Glimpse of Greatness,"Probably the best of Geston's short catalogue, Out Of The Mouth Of The Dragon details the story of a young man who ventures out into the wider world to join the final battle of armageddon.The biggest hurdle readers face is the books ponderous, slogging opening. It should also be noted that this, like Geston's other novels, isn't exactly the tightest narative, although for me, the style imparts a welcome dream-like quality, though im sure others see it as a bit sloppy. With that said, once it starts moving along, Mouth of the Dragon is an experience like no other. Geston's hard-edged world is one of sorrowful beauty and moral ambiguity, and he does a great job of immersing you in his strange, melancholic vision of the future.Reading this novel, it strikes me as a real shame that this book is probably the best of a writer who produced little, instead of a flawed early work of an author who went on to become a true master."
3,"Not completely disappointed, but not 100% pleased.","This book was one of three that we purchased when we got our chocolate lab. We wanted specific information as we wanted to correctly and effectively train her to be a joy in our home. The book did offer alot of information...some of it was specific to labs, but in was mostly an ""in general"" dog training book. The biggest disappointment was that it offered no alternatives to clicker training. We weren't completely opposed to the clicker option, but would have liked information on other training methods. All the information on training our lab was focused on the use of a clicker. This book would be useless to someone who opted out of the clicker method.Overall, the book did give good ""baseline"" information, but it left us hoping that one of our other books would be more helpful."
4,One of my favorite Diana albums from the '80s,"I thought that Diana Ross made a good album in 1987. I heard Dirty Looks a lot, and still love it! This song sounds like it could have been made in 1982, but it sounds good on this album. The rest of the songs, such as Stranger in Paradise, It's Hard For Me to Say, Shockwaves, and Shine are also very well done musically and vocally. Maybe this album was a little too perfect because all the songs were good, and the musicians sounded good on here with the sound. This album was easily overlooked in '87 and I am here to say that I loved all of the songs."
5,Good Stuff,"A prayer that I still pray almost every day, teaching ti to my Sunday School Class was a fun and challenging"
1,The book of Jabez - Bible study,"This book was listed as New, when I reviewed the book on a few pages (each full page) of questions had been written into, with a pen. Which takes away from the purpose of ordering the book in the first place. Very disappointed to say the least."
5,Gettysburg: Music From The Original Motion Picture Soundtrac,"If you enjoy history you liked this movie. The soundtrack for this movie was outstanding! Being a decendent of a Civil War participant I enjoy historical recreations and this movie and its music were wonderful. The most trying time in our nations history and the music accentuated the drama, terror, heroism and even touching the moments. A wonderful 2 CD buy plus a bonus fact and fiquire booklet."
4,Cute backpack,"I wanted to get a cute backpack but didn't want to spend a fortune on one of those Petunia Picklebottom bags. For the price, it's great! I gave it four stars because the magnetic closure, which is sewn in the bag moves around...so now my bag doesn't close. Maybe I got a defective bag...The bag has delicate material, so watch out..the material snags.A backpack is the best thing when you have a baby, then you can have both of your hand free."
1,"Attractive bag, but returning it - AGAIN","I fell in love with this bag when registering at Babies R Us. A good friend purchased it for us and I was so excited to receive it. When it arrived, I noticed that there was yucky sticky stuff on the side, so returned it to a Babies R Us store and got a new one. I packed up the bag and before my baby was even born, I noticed that the little magnetic closure (which is attached between the outer and inner material) fell down to the bottom of the bag and I am now unable to close the flap!! I hope to return it to Babies R Us, even though I cut off the tags and no longer have them. I will NOT be exchanging it for another one of these bags. We have been using the free diaper bag we received from the hospital when the baby was born and are happy with it. I don't recommend this bag!"
1,No Tension,"The release is too ""touchy"" and there is no tension adjustment on the release which could cause some misfires if you are not careful."
2,Not what I expected,I bought this because it looks so nice but when I received it I fount that it's different from the picture and the Product Description (deluxe set) it's far from deluxe!
4,The masters of metal are back,"This album is one of the best in years, from any one. Metal that is not watered down. If you like White Noise, I highly recommend this album."
5,Anthrax's Best,"Well here it goes track by track:Contact: cool intro.What dosen't die: Heavy and Fast. Reminds me of Among the living era but dosent sound dated.Superhero: Vol.8 style but better.Refuse to be denied: Great tune. Very dynamic.Safe Home: Catchiest Anthrax song ever written. Great for rock radio.Anyplace but here: Heavy with twists.Nobody knows Anything: Heavy!!!Strap it on: Very cool song. old style feel to it but with new sounds.Black dahlia: FAST! Blast beats, black metal style guitars just brutal.Cadillac rock box: Blusy metalish very cool song.Taking the music back: Great song! Roger sings on it.Crash: Franks singing. Weird song but real cool. Frank's got a great voice.Think about an end: Heavy!!..."
5,The heaviest album with John Bush,"Awesome band,awesome album and an awesome tour.I just saw Anthrax again on 5-9-03 with Motorhead andthey played some tracks from the new album.Let me tellya ,I feel this is the heaviest album Anthrax ever didwith John Bush.The best albums with John in my opinionto own is Sound of white noise,Volume 8 and We've comefor you all.I was impressed with the live show.They playeda good number of old school Anthrax classic's such as:Caught in a mosh,Madhouse,N.F.L.,Anti-social,Metal thrashingmad,Bring the noise,Got the time,Only,Black lodge,Crush anda few new songs as well.I suggest for every old school fan to own the new album.Trust me it's worth it, you won't be dissapointed."
1,This album is a waste of money. Don't buy it.,"If you heard that Anthrax plays thrash, and you like thrash,i.e. old school Forbidden, Exodus, Testament, Sodom, Destruction, etc. Don't be fooled into buying this album....This ISN'T thrash!! It's crap! I wasted money on this album having never before listened to Anthrax and what I had heard was completely right, the singer SUCKS, the jams are weak and lame, and the lyrics are garbage.Why do record companys produce lame stuff like this? Because they think we're stupid enough to buy it. Let's show them they're wrong. Don't buy any crappy new albums from washed up 80's thrash bands , i.e. Metallica, Testament, Overkill, Exodus, Forbidden, Anthrax. Trust me, just because some of them were good in the 80's doesn't mean they don't suck to high heaven now.1 star for a lame-ass ripoff record!"
5,Am I an Anthrax fan now?,"I never liked Anthrax before this album. In fact, I hated them! But, a friend of mine caught this album on XM radio soon after it came out. Once he turned me on to it, I was hooked. From start to finish, there is very little filler here. Almost all great songs. A very strong metal record. Definitely one of the top 5 new albums that I bought in 2004. If this were the mid- to late-eighties, this album could have really propelled Anthrax to Metallica-like fame."
4,Compelling inside look at the last days before the revolution,Many people have a romanticized view of view of the Cuban revolution and Che Guvera. Che was a brutal monster who kill so many people out of fear and ignorance.This movie portrays how little things changed from the rule of the brutal dicator Batista and after Fidel Castro took over. Some would say that things got a lot worse for a lot of people.I loved the quality of this transfer on Blu-ray and I would highly recommend it.
4,good historical reconstruction and fairly balanced approach,"A good historical movie to show how right were many middle class Cubans to despise the Batista dictatorship and how wrong they were to believe that supporting Castro and Guevara would improve things much. Yet, the widespread criticism that Garcia does not show enough of the poor and destitute of pre-revolutionary Cuba is only partially mitigated by his ridicule of Batista in the first part of the movie. The title itself (translated ""Adieu Cuba"" in the French version) betrays a certain nostalgia by the author for the bygone days. But in the end the viewer is left with a strongly negative view of both Batista and Castro, as well as Guevara. Well deserved.The movie is a bit long but well worth its time for it allows the viewer to savour the colors, music and atmosphere of Cuba 50 years ago. But this is perhaps due to the long script by Guillermo Cabrera Infante."
5,A Filmmakers Review,"A Filmmakers ReviewI'll keep it simple.The movie was good.And when I saw it a second time.The movie was great.And when I saw it a third time.I hope that Andy Garcia reedits it and airs the mini-series on TV.The Lost City is a must have for all Cuba, Garcia and film fans.As for any flaws, I consider them part of the entertainment.Luis Moro.Never Hide."
5,An incredible movie about how it began,"As a young Cuban-American it helped me feel what our families went through during that time. Very emmotional...The movie was great and done very well. It's really not a movie about Castro, but a movie about a beautiful island that had so much passion, beauty, culture and talent and how it was all stripped away by deception. Andy Garcia did a beautiful job with this movie and was joined by an incredible cast."
4,Its Allright,"If you are Cuban or of Cuban descent you will find this movie interesting, if your not then it's a toss up. Great costumes, OK considering the tight budget (9 Million) but a little narcisitic and to much focus on a bizzare love affair. Bill Murray is funny as alawys but perhaps out of place. As for the Castro apologist, this movie is accurate both in portraying Batista's violent (and deadly) hold on power, and Castro's bloody triumph and aftermath (property confiscation scenes are very accurate). Sad that this movie will not be released in South America because of the realistic depiction of Che Guevara as a cold blooded killer, I guess some folks can't handle the truth."
2,Meh...,"Barely acceptable. Not consistent at all, poor cane quality - that being said, when you get a good one (perhaps 10%), they sound great. at least they're cheap!"
5,Fantastic!,"This is really an outstanding film, and I would recommend this to anyone who has not yet seen it. Set in Germany before the Wall came down, it is about a couple families who want to escape the communism in the East and come up with a daring plan to do so.Since this is A)Disney and B)a true story, one would assume the outcome is a happy ending, right? Not so fast! I dare you to sit still through this movie and peacefully await the ending. It is truly a thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat!When I watch movies like this (going against the communist machine, etc), emotions run high--at least with the good ones. This movie does not disappoint on the emotions or the thrills.As for the acting, one of the wives was less than stellar, but she was the only weak spot. Don't let that stop you from a great family film!"
4,Pretty good,"I bought this book for a Bioethics course. However, it has come in handy in my other studies. I think that this book is a great asset to have."
1,Worst book ever!!,"Unable to understand it, boring, boring, boring. I dropped the class because I was unable to understand this book. Waste of money and time!!!"
2,Not Overwhelmed,"I'm a Lancaster fan, and he was fine in this richly made production, but the story was not carried along rapidly enough to keep my attention, nor was the then new Italian starlette (whose name escapes me) particularly entrancing. Measured against his other work, this rates two stars."
1,A Bore!,"How Critereon can call this Blu-ray version restored is amazing to me. A lousy print was used, full of speckles and dust blobs..l don't think they even bothered to clean the print they used before the transfer. Add to that the film is the most boring l have ever seen."
1,THREE HOURS I WILL NEVER GET BACK,"Some critics have said this film is painterly. I spent three precious hours of my life watching the equivalent of paint drying on the wall. Three hours I'll never get back. Three hours I could have spent painting one of my OWN walls.This is the dreck Truffaut railed against when he wrote ""A Certain Tendency..."" for Cahiers du Cinema in the early fifties. This is the dreck that people with absolutely no taste find artful. I've seen home movies of graduation parties that were more interesting then this travesty.Burt Lancaster was once in a MUCH better film called CRIMSON PIRATE... a film with more life in any of its sixty seconds than Visconti manages in three hours."
3,More for the young.,I like Sue Johanson's no nonsense way of talking but a lot of the questions she answers in this book just don't interest me. It was entertaining though.
1,Not Hydrating At All,"I'm completely dumbfounded. I have been using Phyto products for years and I love them. I thought I'd try this to make my hair more hydrated- it's been feeling a little dry. But, this product doesn't make my hair any more hydrated. In fact, it makes my hair feel even drier than it was feeling before. I don't know how that could be possible! This is garbage."
2,Not good for kinky / african hair,This product did not work well on my natural hair. It did not penetrate the hair shaft. I wouldn't bother with this one.
5,Best of the trilogy,"This is by far the best of the 3 Keeper of the 7 Keys. The song I'm Alive is one of the best, possibly even the best, Helloween songs ever! Future World is also a classic. If you want to hear Helloween at it's best, this is the one CD to buy!"
5,WOW - Beautiful and Great Recipes!,"The one word that best describes this cookbook is ""WOW!"" The pictures and beautiful, the party formats have loads of great ideas, and most importantly, the recipes really are ""fabulous!"" I've tried 4 recipes and they all came out tasting delicious and looking exactly like the pictures. I've also tasted another 10 dishes that friend's of mine made, and they were all great - I am definitely going to make them myself."
2,VERY GOOD PICTURES - P E R I O D .,I JUST WROTE ON THE TITLE WHAT I THINK ABOUT THIS BOOK. MORE THAN THAT: DON'T waste YOUR MONEY AND THE CALORIES ON THIS BOOK\RECIPES. FULL OF FAT RECIPES AND MOST OF THEM- VERY NOT HEALTHY.I GAVE 2 STARS BECAUSE OF THE BOOK DESIGN - VERY IMPRESSIVE.
3,Not the best choice,"This book's usefulness is diminished by the often heavy-handed techniques it demonstrates. The old age makeup, for instance, is poorly applied and would not register well with an audience. Swinfield is at her best with fantasy makeups such as Titania--but watch out for those techniques that can be done far better, such as the ""troll's"" latex nose. Beginners looking for a basic text at a reasonable price would do well to investigate Laura Thudium's ""Stage Makeup""; those willing to bite the bullet and shell out the big bucks should purchase Richard Corson's ""Stage Makeup,"" the bible of the field."
5,A fabulous general reference,"For the person who wants to get an excellent grounding in stage makeup, this is the place to start. It very well may be the place to end, also,unless you need to delve more deeply into special effects makeup. Rather than giving you hard and fast rules, the author explains the principles behind good makeup design and application. There are tons of pictures, and it covers most basic makeup situations for stage, with a cursory treatment of other applications such as film and television."
5,great textbook,I needed this book for a stage makeup class. The book gives great instruction for different applications. I think it is a very useful reference to anyone interested in makeup application.
4,"Popular, if dated, reader - and still valuable for ESL/Citizenship Teachers","This once popular series might be dated and hard to find, but the entire series contains realistic situations facing new American immigrants. Back in the mid-1990s, I taught from this series in two ESL/citizenship programs. It was an excellent supplemental resource as a class set and often lead to good discussions and poignant student writings.While the field has developed, I would be pleased if I could acquire an entire set of this series to add to my professional library."
4,"My father, the Brown Derby chef, used this book",My father was the chef of the Brown Derby in Beverly Hills for eleven years. This book was his cooking bible long after he left the Derby.
5,Just the right look...,"When one thinks of Alexandre Dumas' three musketeers and of D'Artagnan, one usually imagines men who look exactly like the ones in this movie...in other words, the casting is just right. Leonardo DiCaprio also does a terrific job in his dual role, able to act evil and underhanded as King Louis or gentle and vulnerable as his twin Philippe with wonderful ease and feeling. Hats off to this talented young actor for such a versatile and interesting performance. The musical score, the costumes and the sets all contribute to the making of this a fine period drama...Bravo to all, cast and crew, for this highly enjoyable movie!"
4,A very good film,"Not being a fan of DiCaprio, I still enjoyed this film. He was actually very good in this movie. Whoever casted for ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" did it to perfection. It is defintialy a great adaptation of Dumas' tale!"
1,The Crap in the iron mask,"This movie is unfortunately not worth the price. There are two fatal flaws that any well-educated member of the human race ought to realize straightaway: 1. The star is Leonardo DiCaprio. 2. The star is not Patrick McGoohan.In short, WIMPY!!! The better version is the '70s edition starring Richard Chamberlin, and possibly the best actor ever, Mr. Patrick McGoohan, recently appearing in such films as Braveheart.My Advice: Toss this out with your copy of Tomorrow Never Dies and get some real pictures. But I will say that the new Count of Monte Cristo is awesome, as compared to the older one. So as they say, ""1 out of 2 brings in just as much cash as 2 out of 2."" Way to go, Hollywood!"
3,"This dvd has a majorly SUPURB cast, BUT","it just seemed lacking in every other way to me. Maybe, I remember the power of the novel or, maybe, I romanticize the Richard Chamberlain version---- I'm not sure. But, mostly I found this production boring. Visually it is beautiful. The great cast and the eye candy are just not enough. The majesty of this story , in my opinion, is, simply, not there. BUMMER"
5,captivating,"This was without a doubt one of the best movies I have ever seen. Leo was a bit out of place in 17th century France, but everyone else was perfect, especially Gabriel Byrne as D'Artagnan. I think Gabriel did a wonderful job of conveying his character's angst and conflict. I was really upset when he and Athos became enemies after Athos's son was killed. John Malkovich was also great as Athos, both grieving and vengeful. I thought the bond he formed with the good twin, Phillippe, was touching. Jeremy Irons seemed a little too detached as Aramis, but he still did a good job and was a perfect straight man for Gerard Depardieu, who was wonderfully crude and disgusting as Porthos."
4,A nearly great movie.,"I had not considered seeing this movie mainly because I am not a Leo fan. However I caught it on cable and was stunned. I bought myself a copy the next day. My 16 year old son thinks I am crazy because I have watched it 10 times in 2 weeks.Leo did well, but Gabriel Byrne was outstanding. I especially love the last thirty minutes."
5,I want to see The man in the iron mask video.,I realy want to see The man in the iron mask whole video
3,Dumas' Plot Makes Up for Bad Movie,"I didn't really expect much out of Leo DiCaprio, but I certainly expected better acting out of john Malkovich, Gerard Depardieu and Jeremy Irons. They just were never able to summon any enthusiasm for the roles-- indeed, their muttering of ""All for one and one for all"" sounded more like an unenthusiastic 6th grade class responding to their teacher's ""good morning"" than the stirring call to action it was meant to be.I would have given the movie a 2, except for the compelling plot-- bad acting and bad staging could not completely overshadow the genius of Dumas' story. That is the true tribute to Dumas-- even bad acting couldn't ruin his story."
2,"Jeremy Irons is awesome, but DiCaprio...ick","I just saw this movie a few days ago, and I still have a lingering bad taste in my mouth from it. It's all right to veer away from the original book's plot, but I can only take so much. The twist at the end was just too much to stomach. DiCaprio was a horrible casting choice, sounding very much like a 20th century brat rather than a spoiled French king. He was better as Phillipe...I guess he just doesn't play royalty well at all. The only glimmer in this movie were the familiar old Muskateers, Jeremy Irons in particular. He's always brilliant, so I tacked on one more star than I wanted to, just for him. DiCaprio may pull in an audience, but it's the Muskateers the put out a quality performance. Too bad this movie was such a waste of their talent."
4,Man In the Iron Mask,"Surprisingly, this movie isn't all that bad. The acting could have been better but other than that, it was good."
5,A MASTERPIECE!!!!,"I used to think Leonardo DiCaprio was cute- that is why I went to see it for the first time. I saw it 4 times altogether. Now, I'm not exactly crazy about him anymore, but I love that movie. Not only is the man who played Felipe/Louis wonderful, but Gerard Depardieu's performance as one of the Musketeers was hilarious! Loved it!"
3,Surprised !!,"I paid $ for this game...one of those which looked interesting, but figured was just a ""joke""....while anyway, it turned out to be plenty of fun...an arcade game with 5 levels and a few missions in each level...graphic's are average at best, but gameplay makes up for the graphic's...It was one of those rare times which I was pleasantly surprised...It's no ""Command and Generals"" but, what the heck.... $ for 30 minutes of good arcade is not bad..."
2,Too hard,The bolster is simply too hard to be comfortable. I would recommend that a description of how hard it is be included in the details about it so that others can know it's not a soft pillow. I don't use it.
4,Very solid stuff,"This album -- more than its predecessor, _Bad Influence_ -- highlights the Cray that was to come to the fore in _Strong Persuader_ and _Midnight Stroll_. Songs like ""Porch Light"" (probably my favorite Cray tune ever), ""Playing in the Dirt"" are playful, but with an edge -- ""She's Gone"" and ""I've Slipped Her Mind"" are about as sad a pair as you'll find. Cray's singing and guitar playing are extremely strong. The only slip up is in song selection: ""Same Old Funky Thing"" is just goofy, and ""Sonny"" is well-meaning but dull. But if you want to see why the blues is still around today, this is an important album to own."
2,"Fantastic show, lame DVD","It's nice to have these randomly-selected episodes on DVD. But the collective package is lacking. No commentary tracks and the lone special feature is simple blurbs about a handful of characters. Even the menus are slapdash: the music playing underneath is either the entire opening theme or the end credit jingle, one or the other, over and over again.I don't fully understand. Frederator has their animatics, production art, backgrounds, character designs, etc. available online. One of the writers even posts the chords to the show's songs. There's plenty of readily-available material that could have been included. I guess they're holding out for the season-by-season collections? I hope?"
1,NOT SEASON ONE COMPLETE!,"Adventure Time Fans Please Note: This DVD is NOT a complete Season 1 DVD, Cartoon Network is trying to trick you all into buying a select few episodes and I am assuming down the line they will release a more complete boxed set including DVDs with entire seasons. ""My Two Favorite People"" is just getting the fans on the hook to buy multiple version of the DVD to make more profit. I love Adventure Time with all my heart but being a perfectionist I refuse to be taken advantage of with this incomplete DVD. Also if Pendleton Ward is reading this: Thank you for creating such a fantastic show!EDIT (April 2012):User Mushi has notified me that Season 1 is on the way: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007Q0JJHC"
5,Best animated series ever,"I really enjoyed this DVD and I hope Cartoon Network will put this out as a dvd series. As the other reviews mentioned, it's not so much a ""season 1"" disk as it is a dvd of selections. Notably absent from this DVD is the Wizard Battle episode."
4,"Great show, but would have preferred a season set with extras","This DVD contains 12 individual episodes from Adventure Time, not in any particular order. It seems they just picked the 12 mos popular, as some are from season 1, while others are from the second season. The episodes themselves are great, but the DVD is rather bare-bones. No extras except a written character bio for the main players, and no previews except a commercial for Cartoon Network. It'd have been nicer if this had been a season 1 set, or even just a volume set like Flapjack, Chowder, Mystery Inc., and Looney Tunes got, with extras, but oh well. Maybe if this sells well enough, they'll release whole seasons. Anyway, for the price it's not too bad at all."
3,"Entertaining, and not too ""deep""","What I call a good ""fluff"" book, keeps your interest without getting too involved. Story is entertaining and keeps you reading til the end"
3,Cooter's Good,"I found the highlight of this CD cooters 4 tracks...especially Spring Training which is just a really good song. Slick shoes music sounds good until the vocs. come in, then it's mxpx all over again. Their bassist seems very talented and he's got some cool basslines in the songs. I like this CD but I don't love it."
1,Wrong Item Received,"I specifically checked before I ordered that I was buying the proper adapter for my older Elite Xbox 360. However, I received a replacement battery adapter for the NEW X-360 slim. This is extremely stupid and I am quite irked."
1,Not what was described and ordered.,"Had to send it back for the correct one.That is all I want to say, but these reviews require me to say more. I don't think more is necessary!"
1,Not the right power supply for Xbox 360!,"I'm just going to copy someone elses review because the same thing happened to me:Despite the description saying:Product Featuresreplacement for original Microsoft XBOX 360 power adapter. This item does not work for the newest version XBOX 360 SLIM for Kinectcheck back of your XBOX console to determine which power supply is compatibleitem works with Consoles that require 203W or lessThe item I received was labeled ""Xbox Slim"" and ""135W."" The sellers for this item listing seem to rotate rapidly. Mine came from ""Super Electronics."" Returning and buying local to be sure I get the right item.Idiots."
4,Strong's Concordance,This product has helped me to find more words so that I can understand the use or meaning of the word in the text.
5,The Best!,"Strong's Concordance has always been the best concordance I know of. I love it! There is only one thing that rivials it, and that is E-Sword, a software program on my computer."
3,"engaging, but perhaps not this author's best effort","I usually enjoy the books written by Koonz, and ""Lighting"" was no exception.The protagonist, Laura Shane, shined brightly as a character to love and root for, especially in the first portion of the book. In the latter stages, for some reason, my connection with her faded a bit, perhaps as the fast-paced plotting style of Koonz took over. However, it seemed to me that the best part of this novel as far as the storyline also unfolded in the first half. I enjoyed first wondering and then learning of the time-traveling stranger. However, once that revelation of how he comes to be Laura's savior, I thought the book became a little less engaging. Connected with Laura and loving the setup of the plot in the beginning gave way to a somewhat less captivating second half and a somewhat anticlimatic endingI give it a 3 stars, and believe it to be a book worth reading."
4,Flawed but entertaining,"This is an entertaining read with a plot that moves like a freight train, but the dialogue, especially between two 12-year twin girls, is sometimes over the top. Still, I think it would be a great movie (and Rutger Hauer would have to play the male lead). On the other hand, am I the only one who had a problem with ending. I won't give it away, but Koontz's ""solution"" for the cold war left me cold."
5,A Must Read For Koontz Fans,"Once again, Dean Koontz has woven a tale that keeps his reader on the edge of their chair, waiting to see what happens next. I'm not the kind of reviewer who writes a Readers Digest summary of the book. I prefer to tell you that the characters in this book are believable and engaging. Dean always manages to come up with plot twists that are unexpected, and usually a bit terrifying. As with most of his books, I read this one in a short two days. I'm retired, so thankfully, have the time to do that much reading. After reading this book, you'll never think of lightening the same way. It's a must read."
4,I have yet to finish Strangers.,This is my second time reading both books. I am anxiously awaitting the Apocalypse series. Lightening was one of the first Koontz books I read. I have read all of them so Strangers and Lightening are favorites of books from this Author.
4,Good Book,"Not one of his best in my opinion as some of the ""jokes"" were corny, but I enjoyed reading it."
4,"Gripping from the beginning, less at the end","Nice plot, especially if you like the idea of time travel. The book builds up very carefully and creates suspense right from the start. The story evolves a bit into an almost comical Nazi plot and seems a bit rushed towards the end, but all in all a very nice read."
3,Far-fetched science-fiction tale,"Despite the absurd plot- so typical in Koontz novels- the book was surprisingly thoughtful, but I still ended up seeing it as science-fiction more than suspense. The first half of the book was the best. The characters were likable, especially the child. In short, it's not Koontz at his best but still an okay read."
5,Lightning,"This was my first Koontz book, after finishing it I was hooked. Koontz has included all of the key elements in Lightning...mystery, romance, sci-fi. If you've never read any of his work, I suggest you start with this exceptional piece of fiction. It will keep you on the edge of you seat! Typically I read this book twice a year for about 10 years now. You will fall in love with Laura Shane and everything she stands for."
2,A surprising disappointment,"This was my first Dean Koontz book--and will probably be my last. It was recommended to me by one of his millions of fans. I was mildly curious at first, but the book quickly became childish. The only thing that kept a tiny bit of my interest was the main character's evolving writing career. The whole time-travel debacle wasn't worthy of print. I found Koontz's characters shallow attempts to imitate the interesting and believable people you find in a better horror story--like any of Stephen King's."
4,Koontz Authors Sci-Fi Love Story,"Who is the tall blonde, blue eyed stranger that keeps popping up in Laura's life?Where does he come from?Most importantly, Why?These are the things that you need to listen to or read the book to find out. This was a wonderful audio book. I listened to it while making a 3-hour drive. I started it just as I left and it finished about 10 miles from my home.Yes I do have some negative input. This was the abridged version and I feel it was abridged just a little too much. It was rather obvious where large portions are missing. However; it was still a good audio book. Mr. Mariner (narrator) did a wonderful job.I have read and listened to many books by Mr. Koontz. This was a great book and I am considering reading it. Typically I don't read a book after listening to the audio book, but this may be the exception.If you like Koontz, Sci-Fi or Love Stories, then this is a book for you. I guarantee, it will have you wanting to read other books by this author."
4,This book has been in my head sins I started to read books,"It has been ""many"" years now sins I have read this book.In fact this was one of the first books I have ever read. Now I have comed over it again and I hope it is just like I remebered it. I will give this book a high rate because of the speciel feeling this book has given to me all this years, but I cant say if that was because of my age or it was because of the fact that this book is a ""real MCcoy"". The answer wil be in my next review of this book, when I have read it again... Now in a age of 23, and is a little writer of my own. Look out for it."
3,action hero,"I usually enjoy books about time travel. I really liked ""the Mirror"", ""Somewhere in time"" and ""Time and Again"". Lightning started out really good but about a third of the way through it turned into a corny action hero yarn. At times I thought I was reading a screen play. The dialog of the 8 year old boy was nothing I've ever heard from an actual little boy and the charecter of homely, best friend Thelma was such a cliche. This was my first Dean Koontz novel."
5,"Blu Ray...when to DNR or not to DNR, there lies the problem...","Just have to give my say on these reviews of the so-called horrible blu ray transfers. Just to remind people this movie IS about to be eighty years old! Grain is obvious and the detail is lacking, but it is still a beautiful transfer of this masterpiece. DNR would destroy what detail there is. You want to enhance the image and not take away from it. Just can't understand why some films transfer better than others from the same time period. Grain on this release actually gives the film 'atmosphere'. Remember you want it to look like film, not video which is what most blu rays look like: video. We need more transfers like this one that retains the film-like quality over the 'video' look that we get from studios these days.Anyway, had to give my opinion over this 'controversial' transfer that most people will not like...once again, remember it's film, not video. Enjoy this quality transfer, because it's the best it has ever looked!!"
5,A Grudging Vote for Colorization,"I have to admit, when colorization first came out I was shocked and offended. I couldn't imagine anyone messing with the classics, including King Kong (one of my all-time favorites). But when I finally broke down and got this colorized version it has become one of my favorites as well.Admittedly, colorization destroys some of the ""atmosphere"" of a classic horror film. The positive side, however, is how much easier it is to distinguish background and small objects, particularly in the jungle scenes, compared to the black & white version on a small television screen.When Ted Turner first bought these film rights and began colorizing them, he threatened to pull the black & white versions from distribution. That would be criminal. But having both available, I now realize, is a plus."
2,"5 Star Movie, 2 Star Blu-Ray","There's really no reason to upgrade to this Blu-Ray edition if you have the DVD released several years ago. The improved resolution simply magnifies the grain of the film and unfortunately it detracts from your enjoyment of the movie. The Special Features menu is particularly difficult to navigate. While it has quite a few features relating to the making and history of Kong, you don't know which feature you're going to see until you hit ""OK"" on your remote. Some movies should not be transferred to Blu-Ray. The original King Kong is one."
5,Where is the DVD?,"""King Kong"" single-handedly saved RKO Studios from extinction. I cannot believe that a super, classic movie that was way ahead of its time in effects has not been released on DVD. I grew up watching Kong every time it was shown on ""Million Dollar Movie"" in New York. As a counterpoint, I saw the 1970'S remake once in the theater and then I went back to the original. I bought the VHS version from Amazon last year and, at the rate I am going, I will wear it out by next year. There is no reason to repeat the plot here as it is related elsewhere. If you are in a position do get this transferred to DVD, here is one fan waiting for it.Thanks PJ! Your remake, which I thoroughly enjoyed, finally got the studio to release the 1933 Kong on DVD. I am looking forward to the DVD of yours in a few weeks."
2,Dent in the casing,"This is one of the greatest movies in film making. One of the best ever made in my opinion. That's why i had to own it. They sent it in a reasonable time, but the only problem was that it came with dents in the casing. The shipping box wasn't damaged at all....so they(Warehouse Deals, Inc) sent the package with damaging on it. Very disappointed that they would send out a copy like that."
1,Dumb Coconut Brain!,"King Kong is a dumb movie. This ape kills my favorite dino! TREX! It was very violent with people getting eaten (in close-up view!) and a baby almost dies! I think Jurrasic Park 1 and 2 were way better. I would have gave it zero stars but ... at the end, so I would give it one. (GOOD!)"
4,Interesting look at music,I happened on this PBS show after it had started and was fascinated by the ideas and concepts. Bought a copy that I am loaning out to friends who have music as part of their life and presume some of them will buy their own copy for reference.
4,Fan of the book,"Tommy Tenney wrote a very enjoyable book. I love Bible history and I felt he stayed within the Scripture's guidelines of facts. Mr Tenney showed the history in a compelling manner, yet provided Esther with a believeable humanity. Many people today may not realize this is a bible story, but it's right out of the book of Esther (between Nehemiah and Job). If this book encourages people to wonder what the Bible said about Esther, maybe they'll dust off their Bible's and start reading.Maybe they'll even wonder what the Bible says about Jerusalem.Zechariah 12:3 NIV says: ""I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock for all the nations. All who try to move it will injure themselves."" I'd like to see Mr Tenney write a book about that too."
5,Very cool,"My son and I had a great time painting this and getting it ready for our r/c car.Had to do a little cutting. When we got done with it , it looked great and fitted great.Will buy again after we crash this body up."
2,Looks are very deceiving!,"This is not a replica car as pictured! This is a plastic shell you have to paint and add the decal stickers enclosed. You also have to purchase separately the undercarriage and wheels. This plastic shell is approximately 22 inches long and 5 inches high. This was a huge upset when I first seen it, so this will definately be getting returned!"
1,Painfully bad...,"I guess comedy must certainly be different for all of us, in evidence by all the glowing reviews here for this DOA film. Never has a 90 minute film seemed so long. I almost shut it off a few times, as the jokes in this film were just too pain-inducing. Example 1...how many times did we need to see the newspaper man get hit on the head with a bundle of papers, and have him state that his eyesight was restored or lost. It appeared the writer and director of this train wreck were imbibing in some serious drugs during the production of Johnny Dangerously, to think this was funny. With fine actors like Keaton, DeVito, and Piscopo...what a waste of talent.To see a spoof film that really works, check out Airplane or any of The Naked Gun movies."
5,Was the guy that wrote the editorial review high??,Whoever wrote the editorial review for Amazon is dead wrong. This movie is a classic. I can recite plenty of scenes from memory that's how many times I've seen it.
4,Satire at the very best,Johnny Dangerously has many many big names in comedy. This is a satire of gangster movies. It's been one of my favorite movies for a long time. Michael Keaton does a great job as Johnny. I recommend it for anyone who has a dry sense of humor.
2,disappointed,Was hoping for a little more steam. I would not watch this unless you just find the charm of older movies to make up for the lack of passion
4,If You Saw Me On Church On Sunday You Can Tell...,"That This is the best soundtrack released for a very long time! Featurings such great artists as Donnell Jones, Carl Thomas, Liberty City and of course Isaac Hayes. The old school groove is really great without sounding dated.But the shining moment for me is R Kelly's song ""Up and Outta Here"". It is in the same league as ""I Believe I Can Fly"". Here is an artist who really puts an effort in his soundtrack work. Anyone who has heard ""I Believe I Can Fly"", ""Gotham City"", ""Take My Time Tonight"" and ""Freak Me"" will know that R Kelly is at his best on soundtracks."
3,Just okay,"Not as happy with this album as I thought I would be, there wern't a lot of his music on there that I thought there would be. Still enjoy what is on there though."
4,Kenny collection #14.,"Ok, so Kenny Rogers has a ton of ""Hits"" albums out, but this is possibly the best on one disc. Nearly every major hit is included, however, the #2's and 3's didn't make the cut. Mostly I miss ""Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town"", and a few other minor hits. But it's hard to complain when we get ""Lucille"", ""Coward Of The County"", ""Lady"", and numerous others. Plus this includes his perfect duet with Dolly ""Islands In The Stream"", and the infamous sing-a-long ""The Gambler"". It's still hard for me to get interested in new country when the classic songs sound this good. If you need more Kenny than this, you'll have to get the 42 track ""Ultimate Hits""."
3,THE Treatise,"A fine treatise, a bit expensive for law students. But, this is the 3rd edition, and I believe the 5th is current."
5,One of the music dvd's I plan to keep!,"Extremely gifted and talented Sheryl Crow delivers an incredible perfomance for a midwestern city. I like the setting, the video, sound, all of it is great! Her band really impressed me, espcecially; because I am a die-hard Rush fan and tend to compare other musicians with Rush. Sheryl's band can definitely hold thier own and are all incredible musicians'. I really loved the conclusion of the dvd with ""Rock 'n Roll"". A fitting end to one spectacular concert. Most bands who put out dvd's are junk and I usually end up getting rid of them. Not this one, Sheryl puts forth one incredible display of talent. Her vocal range is unbelievable and her musical skills are strongly displayed as she plays bass, accoustic, electric guitars, and even the keys. I would recommend this dvd to anyone who appreciates music and the diversity of music from one heck of a talented group of musicians."
2,"Ok , until she starts bad mouthing America",The video quality is fine. The sound quality is not as good as Globe due to the lack of a DTS track. It really is a shame she ruined a concert by bad mouthing The United States.
2,don't like it,"Even though I have and like Lift Weights to Lose Weight which is a big part in this one, I don't like anything else on this DVD including the Yoga. Definitely non-motivating and boring. The weights section I can easily play from the original DVD. I would not recommend this one."
3,Adequate,"This was a book covering much of his life and work, but there was nothing in it that was not in every other book I have read on him. I was hoping for more."
1,Do NOT buy this book,This book is wrong on so many levels. It encourages women to tolerate abuse and adultery in the name of suffering like Jesus did. Sickening.
1,Book is full of Debi Pearl's twisted opinions,"Unfortunately, I read this book before reading the reviews. It was in my disgust for the book, that I got online to read the reviews to see what other Christians thought. I firmly agree with the many negative comments that have already been brought out. This book is full of Debi Pearl's twisted opinions, but rather than be stated as that, the book uses a type of pathetic guilt to try to lead the reader to think that what she is saying is Biblical. I would not recommend this book to anyone, but those that are in a failing marriage due to physical, emotional, or verbal abuse need be very cautious of the harm that can be done if following the opinions of the Pearl's, especially where kids are involved also."
5,This is 100% biblical and has changed our family!!,"After reading and re-reading this book and the scriptures that Debi references it just makes so much sense why the world is so messed up. Read this book and start taking responsibility for your role as a wife and in God's Kingdom.Those that frown on this book and throw it down or ""spit fire"" is because of their pride and refusal to accept the beautiful and glorious position that God has given us women. Pray that God will show you the TRUTH and that you would embrace it and you will see miracles in your own home!Don't be fooled by what others say about the Pearl's...They do not advocate staying with a husband that ""attacks you with a butcher knife"" or ""messes with the kids"". On the contrary they have stated that it is imperative to go to the authorities and let them take it from there! Don't be stupid if you are in a physically abusive marriage!! Get OUT before it's too late!"
1,created to be his help meet,i have been married for thirty years and was looking forward to further strengthening my marriage. this book is not the way. i found as i was reading this book i could not respect a woman who would offer such destructive advice and if i followed her ways i would not be able to respect myself.
1,DANGER! STAY AWAY!,"I found this book to be an unrealistic, unbalanced view on how marriage should be. I am a Christian, but I found this book to be poison to anyone who is seeking marriage counsel. I feel the Pearls have missed the mark on what God has intended for marriage. A woman was made from Adam's rib NOT his foot. This book painted a ""door mat"" life for the wife. Please read other sources on marriage to receive well thought out counsel on marriage. Gary Chapman or Tim LaHaye are great places to start. If there was a way to give this 0 stars that is what I would have given it. If you are in need of counsel, please seek it from a competent source. By the way, I took these views to a counselor and the opinion they had of this material ""an unbalanced approach to marriage."""
1,Not worth my money,"Some good ideas on attitudes : thankful heart, respecting and honour.But a strange mixture. Not a book I will lend to anybody.Not worth my money"
1,Can you say Cult?,"There should be a choice for 0 stars. If you've read this book and are following it to a tee, don't drink the purple kool-aid!"
1,Dont waste your time on this one,"Just seeing over 115 one star reviews should be enough to make one question this book. Mrs. Pearl gives foolish, potentially dangerous, advice, is very critical and judgmental, and doesn't have a biblical foundation for much of what she writes. Read some of the other one star reviews for details, but please don't bother reading this book."
5,A Blessing From Above,"First the No greater Joy books now this book has changed our lives just in the last six months. Its so easy to become infiltrated with all the diluted pyscobabble of today and live a survival mode life in frustration or you can heed GODs word which is clear and simple and live a full of joy life. The word tells us to obey our husbands and for our husbands to love of us like Christs loves the church, and just because he may not be taking his responsibility seriously does not pardon us from ours. We answer to God and He has commandedus. He created us and knows whats best just as we know whats best for our children."
4,"Bold, convicting, life changing!","Debi Pearl is a woman full of GRACE and WISDOM. Her bold approach and counsel is refreshing. She tells you what you need to hear in a funny and conversational manner. She holds no punches and tells it as it is. She instructs us how to graciously, and honorable love our husbands as they are. She lives out her counsel and has a marriage made in Heaven. I have been blessed and all of the women in my family will be getting this book for Christmas...if I can wait that long!"
4,Do you want an attitude change? Read this book!,"This book was very helpful and still is as I keep rereading parts that help me keep my heart focused on what I CAN do to make our marraige beautiful and not on what he's not doing.It seems like whenever I read it, I end up encouraged to be all that I should be for my love."
1,not biblical,I read the whole book and found that it was not always based in Biblical standards. Some things sounded good until I investigated further and found they were not Biblical. Read carefully (if at all) and with the Bible handy.
5,Life changing!,I am on chapter 7 of this book. It gives a whole new understanding and perspective of the marriage relationship. It is straight forward in its approach. I was floored from the first chapter. I think that every Christian woman should read this book and pray for God's guidance in their approach to their marriage relationship.
5,Great guide for women,"I read some of the negative reviews for this and feel that many quotes are, as expected, taken out of context or blown out of proportion. This is a guide, glean from it what you can. If you are a ""modern"" woman of today, of course you are going to be offended. You are portrayed here as having the most to learn. Soften your heart and let down your bristles, I know it hits home. You are selfish and really do need to learn your place, this is probably just the first time someone has dared to tell you how wrong you are. If you are a quiet subservient type, this will prick your heart as well. There is no perfect woman so get off your high horse. This is not the Bible. There are many, many ideas by the authors, most of them right on. But not scriptural, so realize that. Read your Bible, there is no substitute."
5,Excellent Read,"If you are ready to love God by understanding how to be a Godly wife, you need to read this book. I have been married 13 years. I want to do God's will in my life with regards to my marriage. Anything that I do in my life should be for God's glory and how to do it is in his holy word, The Bible. I grew up in a home where my Mother had the all time habit of being a contentious wife. Nothing my Dad did was right. Everything was a complaint and a fight. That was her habit and I did not want that to be repeated in my life too. So I read many books on parenting, marriage...Just so I do things God's way and not the model I grew up with. This book is choc full of scripture and has been all about being selfless instead of selfish. I'd give it 10 stars if I could!"
1,Utter Hogwash,"The advice in this book is wrong, so wrong. As wives we are not helping our husbands if we let them throw trash for us to pick up, let them threaten us, berate us, use and abuse us. I choose to be a woman of dignity. I honor my husband, he honors me. We are equal and happily married for going on 14 years, hope it's at least 60 more!"
1,yikes,"I guess it depends on your frame of reference, your personality type, the way you view yourself, your husband, the world, and who God really is, to some degree.A lot of women in these reviews as well as women I know were falling all over themselves to get a copy of this book. When someone gave me one I could not wait to get it out of the house after I'd read it.A few good points. The best was her breakdown of the 3 types of men. Mine is definitely a steady and I intend to remember, pray about and learn more about my man and how to be the best wife to him.Ms. Pearl speaks with a chilling lack of compassion, and I am hard pressed to find grace anywhere in her teaching. Some women are apparently not bothered by this; others for whatever reason don't even appear to notice it. If chauvanistic men (and women), bad marriages and mean husbands really get on your nerves, find another book."
5,"If you are late 40's and still a Duran fan, of course you will like this....","Excellent. Good mix of old and new. Not really a track I wouldn't have used. Pretty obvious that there are some liberties taken with voice overs/pre-recorded soundtracks. Simon just can't bust out studio quality on every song anymore. But short of the almost too perfect sound, it was great. Best part, my 8 and 10 year old couldn't wait for it either. They have Rio and Hungry on their Nintendo DS's and require the new album be played in the car (select tracks...AOR is dead). Can't say I would buy the CD in that it is just a mix of studio sound but seeing the live was great. Saw Astronaut live but didn't make it to last tour. Next best...."
4,"Nice sound, too much visual fx for me","Great concert. Sound is superb, with much clarity and all isntruments definable on ear.Personally I don't like concert image over-processed and this one has many effects.But overall is a nice DD product."
1,Uninspired and flat,"Let me start out by saying that I've only read the MEK title of this compilation so this review is not based on Reload... However i have read some of Ellis's other short story works and they all seem to wallow in the same pit.I am not going to go into the story details as the previous reviews cover this well enough. Mek is derivative, unoriginal, uninspired and full of instances of poorly executed and unneeded violence that does more to take away from the story then to enhance it. The cyber world Ellis creates is one of countless others seen in countless other books movies and comics. The protagonist is boring and has virtually no likable qualities. The dialogue is cookie cutter at best, and the plot reads like something out of a choose your own adventure book. The book tries to be a political metaphor, a mystery, a revenge story, and a cautionary tale all at once but succeeds only being juvenile.Just avoid this... There are literally thousands of better stories then this"
2,Poorly edited,"The author of this book is a relation of Ed and Lorraine Warren, the famous demonologists (Ed was the only lay person recognized by the Catholic Church in demonology at the time). Unlike ""The Demonologist"", this book fails in its basic attempt to capture your attention. The most annoying aspect of it was the poor editing; you can tell it was self-published. My recommendation is to read this book only if you have nothing better to read on the subject."
5,The best of Wodehouse I have read so far,"This was the first book by Wodehouse that I read and after 12 years and around 20 more books, it still remains unsurpassed in its sheer hilarity and quirkiness. An absolute must read for any Wodehouse lover."
5,Awesome CD,This music is great. I got into this band directly after my Allele phase. I still like both bands a lot though my mood will depend on which I want to mellow out to.
5,Great Story,"Well how do you feel after seeing this movie? I felt great to be able to talk to normal people, I know if I went through this ordeal I would never be the same.I just got my copy on DVD and I am very happy to have all the extras that come with it, I'll let you into a secret the DVD so far isn't Enhanced Region Encoded so you Aussie might want to snap up a copy while they last."
3,Better than Gilligan,"This was a great idea with a great actor that just kind of never gelled. The scenes of Hanks on the island got more and more out in left field, and what started as an interesting look at the survival of modern man in a primative world became a study of frustration and weirdness in a man with no outside contact.The end left you wanting...not for more, or for your money back, but just wanting something more satisfying. Don't go in with high expectations. 2 1/2 stars"
2,"Tom Hanks, WHAT were you thinking?","I've watched almost every movie that Tom Hanks has starred in, I think he's that great. But... Why did he ever choose to appear in this God-forsaken movie about a God-forsaken deserted island? And all that dieting he did... He could have spent that much effort in a whole lot better in a better movie.It's a stupid Robinson Crusoe movie with a stupid plot. Hanks salvages the movie and makes it watchable with his exceptional talent, but not much more.Tom, why don't you switch your agent?"
1,Something went wrong,"Could have been a good film, but something went terribly wrong. I think the screenwriter had alot of internal dialogue that he forgot to share with the audience. Long, long, very long stretches of silence and ""meaningful glances"" that are disconnected from the action. The relationships are fuzzy and never come to a conclusion, it's all left hanging ... the woman artist on the ranch, the former lover now married to someone else, the widowed best friend, even his relationship with his job. It's a movie about a personal journey that leads the viewer nowhere. The trailer shows the best of this film."
1,Boring,"Tom Hanks is wonderful as always, but this is one of the worst movie scripts ever written. Nothing happens! Everything that kind of happens is trite and predictable. There was a lot of potential here, but they just wasted it on a crappy script. I also could have done with a few less shots of the stupid FedEx logo."
2,WITH Tom Hanks this movie bombed......,"I have a very difficult time understanding how ANYONE would think that this is a great movie! Actually the first half isn't bad and if there had been ANY development of the plot in the second half, it could have been a good movie, possibly even a great movie!What this film represents most is the tremendous lost opportunity that was suggested in the beginning......the cinematography and dialogue in the initial scenes and even those on the island were excellent at times, but the remainder of the film was a total dud. NOTHING got developed or enhanced or explained in the second half, as though Tom Hanks and the others who directed it simply fell asleep or got bored, OR ran out of ideas.....Rating this a 2 is fair and honest, and any higher rating would do a disservice to any potential viewers.....sorry...."
4,4 of 5,"There's a great movie in Cast Away. The time in which a Fed Ex worker named Chuck Noland is stranded on an island, most of the movie, is a triumph in movie-making. It puts a single actor on what appears to be a single set for a long time with no real dialogue, other characters to interact with or cuts back to the normal world, and manages to stay both captivating and believable the whole time.Okay, there's one thing that isn't very believable. That has to do with a particular Fed Ex package, one of the few man-made items Chuck has at his disposal. There's also a volleyball, ice skates and not much else. This is a tale of survival in the truest sense. What almost ruins the experience is the epilogue, which lasts for too long and seems irrelevant in comparison to everything that came before it.marcellee.com"
1,Poor ending...,"I watched on TV. Thanks God!!! After 3 hours the director gave us an open ending!!! Maybe I'm not that good criticizing movies, but this one is bad, is a slow movie, a long one, and didn't go anywhere."
1,No refunds on instant.,Tried to rent the instant video tonight. The player could not connect to the video in firefox or chrome. Amazon does not give an option to return digital orders when they don't work.Let the renter beware.
3,"Good, but...","Hank's performance is excellent. Unfortunately, about 25% of the movie is a commercial for FedEx. The CEO even has a part playing himself. The portion of the movie which takes place on the island is great, although I wish they hadn't glossed over the suicide attempt. Predictable filmmaking hurts the end of the movie. Unsurprisingly, the final scene between Helen Hunt and Hanks takes place in the rain. Hanks' character, at a crossroad in his life, is then shown...standing in a crossroad. Hack filmmaking."
3,Washed Up and No Place to Go,"If you're a Tom Hanks fan, you'll enjoy this film. It's basically a one-man play featuring Hanks. If you're not a Hanks' fan it's hit or miss.Director Zemeckis does a fabulous job of putting the viewer on the island. The brunt of the film takes place on the island, with no musical score - only the background noise of the surf.It's basically a survival story in which the survivor comes out changed. Unfortunately, we don't get to see the depth of that change and we are left to wonder about his future ""choices"", but then isn't that how life is?Hanks and Hunt do a wonderful job playing the ""couple that almost was"". We get a real sense of the love and the pain and the maturity of their decision at the end of the film. Hanks realizes that what almost was can never be and goes forward with his life.All in all, the film will leave you thinking and give you much to ponder."
2,"Ordinary ""man stranded on island"" movie, nothing special","I was disappointed. I expected something emotionally moving, grand performances, something. I didn't expect to be bored by the story. I wanted to fast-forward, but I didn't. I kept thinking ""you'll miss something""... but no sir, nothing to miss. Sad, boring, depressing movie."
2,What is the big deal,"OK, I guess if needed to watch this movie in order to be able to spend hours pretending I was stranded on a desert island with nothing to eat but raw fish and coconuts w/ my best friend, the volly ball, then I guess it was worth the two+ hours I spent in the movie theatre induring this dull movie.Or perhaps I was supposed to gain some insite about how the human spirit prevails over all.Unfortunately the interesting part of the story - what drove Hank's character to the brink of suicide - was barely discussed and then almost as an after thought. If this dilema had been the meat of the movie, then it may have been a testament to the an individual's drive to live. However, since this story line was excluded, the viewer walks away with a vague sense that he spent about a week on the island, and other than getting sick of raw fish, wasn't that big of a deal.And what the heck was up with that ending? (...)"
4,Gripping Entertainment,"This mainstream stuff generally makes me balk, but Cast Away isn't half bad. It is excellently made, and makes for a wonderful evening's entertainment. The special effects are superior and convincing, especially the crash scene. All credit to Zemeckis for not launching into the crash too early on in the film, too.In fact, it is fitting that this movie is so well-paced, since it is a movie about time - its effects, its value and its dangers. It is a theme which is often delicately weaved into the plot, but at other times shoved in the audience's face with little subtlety. Nevertheless, it provides for much drama, compelling and often genuinely moving."
2,Throw Away~~~Cast Away,"The name 'Tom Hanks' had me expecting another 'Gump', 'Private Ryan' etc. so I was very disappointed after viewing this movie. It was your typical stranded on a desert island story. Man loves girl, man gets stranded on desert island, man is found in sea by boat, man has lost girl. The only 'cute' difference in this movie was the many tools that the castaway invented from the various things he found in unopened Fed Express packages. The most noticable being 'Wilson' the basketball who Tom befriends from utter boredom. I love Tom Hanks movies but this one wasn't as entertaining as his previous blockbusters. Still, it's worth watching at least once."
2,Tom Hanks Sucks,"Tom's acting in this movie left a lot to be desired. I don't believe he was convincing enough as the ship wrecked sole survivour. His performance was weak and uninspiring thru out the whole movie. I found that it would have been real easy to fall asleep through this movie even the first time I watched it. Robinson Caruso On Mars was a much stronger and inspiring, even though science fiction movie. Not worth the money, and I wouldn't add it to my 500 + DVD collection."
3,Jans,"I thought the movie was a little slow. The most exciting part was his relationship with Wilson. Still, a good movie."
5,Awesome,"What an incredible movie that deserves nothing less than five stars. It's a deeply moving and affecting experience. It's very realistic and true-to-life. Hanks is flawless as are his supporting cast. A number of themes come through here including the importance of not taking things for granted. Why do we all feel as though we have to live and die by the clock? Everything we have can be taken away from us at any moment. I enjoyed this movie, strangely enough, considerably more the second time I watched it about three years after its release. It is sooo enjoyable and you are riveted from the instant the plane is in trouble. Zemeckis is a genius and he and Hanks are greatest team in Hollywood ie) Forrest Gump??I believe it's impossible for someone to say they did not enjoy this movie and if it didn't create emotion within yourself then there is something wrong with you This movie IS that good, even though it may be difficult to watch at times. Great, epic movie."
2,WHY DIDN'T HE PUT WILSON'S HEAD ON THAT DRESS?,"Try as it might to be otherwise, this is still a man-on-a-deserted-island story and there's a lot of campfires and spear fishing going on and a vague life lesson about deserted islands. The surf is much more inviting than the island which remains an unexplored vista. Tom Hanks watching the rolling whitecaps is a haunted, alien scene. Exactly what Hank's character is doing on that cargo plane is anyone's guess. And when will Helen Hunt stop agreeing to anything?"
3,"It was good, and then came the end!","Wilson was very funny, and smart. I think, maybe, they were setting themselves up for a sequal, but what the hell could they do? I can't say how it should have ended, but I guess the message is, 'tomorrow is another day. Thanks,..."
3,In the Mind of the Beholder,"Cast Away (so-called because Nicholas Roeg had already used the title ""Castaway"" in a somewhat better movie), should have taken place inside the mind of Tom Hanks. Robert Zemeckis hadn't the skills to pull that off. So what we're left with are the physical details, daunting enough in themselves, I suppose. For me the best moment in this overwrought film was when Hanks has finally found a way to leave the island. He rows for all he's worth into the unforgiving waves, and looks back at the island that was his home for four, albeit terrible, years. Hanks manages to register enough requisite sadness at the sight of that island disappearing into a squall of rain to make the film almost a success. But then the script-writers took over. Tom Hanks is by now far better than the scripts he is submitted."
4,A good movie; could have been great,"What do you do when you're a total A type personality who lets his health and relationships rot at the expense of your job?Nothing. You carry on and probably never learn unless your plane goes down in the middle of nowhere and you wash up alone on a small deserted island with little chance of being spotted.That's what the whole story is about. While the events are tragic and the character comes back to a changed and sad life (i.e., I believe he was believed dead for over 10 years so everyone else carried on with his life), it's a chance for rebirth.Definitely worth checking out. Good photography and pretty interesting even if Tom Hanks had few ""people"" to speak to on the island. Look for how he ends up building his boat to try and get off the island. Clever or lucky?MY GRADE: B to B plus."
3,The Best FedEx Commercial Ever!,This movie was nothing but a commercial for Federal Express! End of story.
4,Tom Hanks is amazing...,"It is amazing how good of an actor Tom Hanks is! He spends about 45 minutes of the movie not talking and still is able to draw you into the character and plot of the movie. I find that so incredible! This movie is really good...watching him struggle to survive on the island, seeing the development of his 'relationship' with Wilson is hilarious and witnessing his return to civilization is hardwarming. Good movie!"
3,Too much dead time...,"I know that the movie wants to get the point across that Tom Hanks is stuck on an island and needs to be rescued, but he spends half the movie just sitting on the beach waiting. The movie would have only been an hour if they took out the 'waiting' parts. The waiting calls for a viewers boredom that further spreads to uninterested-ness. Overall: Good plot but too long for my taste."
4,Enjoyable performance from Hanks,"Certain guarantees of quality are implied by Tom Hanks' presence in a movie. You also know that it will be a little bit different, and that the lead character will be likeable. This film starts with Hanks' character being very dislikeable, but he gradually mellows throughout the film, and you find yourself warming to him. It is what I would call a 'What-if' film. You are thinking throughout the film 'would I propose marriage to this lady? Would I open the packages that weren't addressed to me? Would I try to kill myself? Would I marry someone else if my spouse was missing, presumed dead? Ultimately the film satisfies. Tom Hanks may not make the same choices that we would make, but you are with him all the way as he makes those choices.The scenery is beautiful too."
5,Displaying the Mentalities in a Survival Situation,"So much emphasis in today's world is placed on having the right gear, having the best technology and having the best skills available.All of those are useless unless the right mentalities are present. In Cast Away this is ever so present and brings you the non-stop emotion-driven actions taken by Tom Hanks character in order to survive and deal with loss, isolation, frustration and depression, not to mention the physical stresses and injuries which are inflicted throughout the ordeal.From a survival point of view this movie is awesome! Showing the importance of never giving up, having tenacity, audacity and clinging on to life values which drive us to keep going. A difficult situation represented well, having me deep in thought about how to survive the situation presented. A great survival movie!"
4,Cast Away,"If you love Tom Hanks..buy it. Needed more action while he was stranded on the island. Not a strong storyline, but I did enjoy it. I have never watched a show with Tom Hanks in it, that I did Not like! I did like this. Tom Hanks was excellent as always in it and I liked the idea of being alone on an uninhabited tropical island (come on..haven't a lot of you at least wondered what it would be like?!). Glad to add it to my dvd collection and will continue to enjoy it for years to come."
1,"Saratoga, Original Cast Album","If you collect original cast albums, I suppose this one should be included. After all, Johnny Mercer was no slouch. However, this is a most boring original cast album. If you never heard it, you'd have missed little."
1,BLEAAAAAAAAAAAARGHHHHHHHHHH !!!,"This album is horrible! It`s a mix of awful and apellative lyrics, poor harmonies, and annoying melodies. It`s always the same thing! If you want to acquaint with the brazilian culture, you`re in the wrong way. Please don`t take this album as an example of the brazilian music, which is very rich. The only thing in Eo Tchan that can represent Brazil are the gorgeous dancers, but unfortunately they don`t appear on this CD."
5,Good Concordance,This is a good item and helps me prepare for catechism classes by giving me quick reference to biblical sites.
5,The absolute best for dry skin!,"This cream is absolutely amazing! I moved from California to extremely dry Arizona. In California I could get away with minimal lotion because of the humidity, but now I cannot drench my body enough. I tried baby oil, cetaphil, and coconut oil. Within an hour, my skin was cracked, itched, and hurt because it was so dry. In desperation I called my dermatologist and she recommended CeraVe. It was the best call I made. I immediately ran to CVS and bought two tubs. My fiance and I drench our body in the cream, felt instant relief, and by the next morning we saw and felt and a huge change. If you have dry, cracked, itchy, painful, and irritated skin because of dry weather please try this amazing cream. You will NOT be disappointed."
5,Amazing.,"I found out about this product from www.makeupalley.com--itwas given very high reviews, so I gave it a go. I am glad I did! This lotion seems to sink right into my skin leaving it moisturized but not greasy. It has 'ceramide' in it---similar to Elizabeth Arden perhaps? In any case, I use this cream everywhere--face, throat, neck, hands etc. Brilliant. (I am in my 50s; I live in a very humid climate)."
2,Disappointed- very moisturizing but provoked huge breakout,"*J's Wife* To say the least, i have VERY sensitive skin (Rosacea and SD). I was very excited to try this moisturizing product since it has so many great reviews and winter was approaching quickly. After 1st night time application, however, my skin broke out in tiny whitish or clear bumps all over my face. Maybe they would have gone away over time but I'm not one to try that sort of thing out :). Yet, now my husband uses it every night and loves it; So, I'm sure it works for some."
3,"Ghost Lacking, but still slick Universal horror","This was the first in the long line of slickly produced Universal monster programmers that cannot compare to the old creaky atmospheric thrillers of the early 1930s Universal era(Frankenstein,Dracula,Bride of Frankenstein, Invisible Man, The Mummy, Dracula's Daughter,etc). Lon Chaney plays the monster like some kind of mindless robot and Karloff's monster was more true to the sense of Shelley's creation in the novel.What makes this film good, but not great is the great character acting of Lugosi as Ygor, the quick pace of this style of programmer film, beautiful Evelyn Ankers(SCREAM QUEEN OF UNIVERSAL!), and plot that would later become characteristic of the Hammer-Cushing Frankenstein series where he was always doing those crazy brain transplants!"
4,High speed industrial dance,"Funker Vogt are back with yet another strong collection of high speed four on the floor industrial dance tracks. Overall the sound hasn't changed that much from their previous full length, ""The Execution Tracks"", but I noticed that the vocals are a bit more tame here and not as high in the mix which I think works better with their sound. The music is still harsh though and thumps relentlessly throughout. ""Nuclear Winter"" is the only track without any percussion really, it has an atmospheric piano that propells the song along with an eerie post-apocalyptic mood and lyrics to fit . Standout tracks for me are ""Sins"", ""Black Market Dealers"", ""The Last"", and the single ""Gunman"". If you don't know Funker Vogt, this album is a good introduction as they have improved on each one. The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because sometimes the tracks blend into each other because of the tempo and sound similarities. Otherwise, be ready to dance. And kill."
3,industrial meets tarzan-speak,"I didn't hate this CD, but I didn't like it either. The beats are good, it's interesting stuff if you like them, but good lord their lyrics are so fractured and goofy they just annoy me."
2,Only for use with dwarfs/mice/other systems,"The tubes for this are the same size at the opening as other tube makers, such as Crittertrail or S.A.M., but these Habitrail tubes narrow to less than an inch across very quickly. They cannot be used with Syrian hamsters, and I am honestly not sure if they will work with dwarf hamsters either.The loft itself will attach to other tubing, however, making the product still usable."
1,Subscription,"I am unable to review this magazine I have never received an issue.Needless to say, I am not happy about this.Lynda Epler"
4,She was his friend???,"An amazing page turner, but it is hard to believe that there was no malice intended. Nixon tried so hard to rewrite history, but this confirms what so many critics said: he was a venal, petty man."
2,"Box Socials mediocre, plotless","WP Kinsella's book ""Box Socials"" is an excellent insight into the white trash of Alberta. It displays a community kind of like Harper Lee's ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" with many well-defined social classes in an area where you're judged by your name. However, the book loses a plot during a Ukranian wedding, and it drudges on to the end."
1,I don't want to be rude but...,"THIS BOOK STINKS. I found it boring and repetitive. I should have done my laundry instead, it would have been more exciting. It's time to retire Mr. Kinsella"
3,It's good because it's Star Wars,"First, don't think that Boba Fett is anywhere in the book, even though a Mandalorian armored individual is on the cover. A good deal of the stories are pretty good. Some of them drag a little, but overall it is a decent compilation. Don't expect any major characters to be directly involved, though Vader makes a brief appearance."
5,"""Alter Cockers"" Getting It On Again..","Was it 1935 Or 1963? Does It Matter?These older guys revisited their days as that great Original BG Quartet of small group Jazz and needless to say this set packs a punch and swings with the best.Wonderful..These Bluebird 1st edition series are beautifully packaged and the sound, booklet are a collectors dream.The great BG on clarinet, Teddy Wilson on piano,Hamp on Vibes,and Gene Krupa on drums all sound ""young"" and come through lively and bright on this historic studio reunion recording circa 1963.Snap it up before it gets hard to find."
1,Arguably one of the worst movies ever made,"Everyone alive should watch this movie once just so they can understand how hard it is to make a movie this bad. The plot manages to transcend reality in an unintentional way. The writing seems to be done by an individual who was hoping to drive people away from the cinema and perhaps towards suicide. When one ponders the incredible amount of money and effort that went into this movie it is soul crushing to reflect on all the suffering that there is in the world. The resources that went into this movie could have paid for clean needles or a bowl of oatmeal for a hungry child. Instead this thing was made. Robert De Niro should be conscripted into the military for making this movie and sent on a suicide mission in the anus of the world. Wesley Snipes has been to prison since this movie was made. He, like this movie, should not have been released."
2,another psychopath,"I don't like Wesley Snipes, it is one of that many american actors that couldn't transmit emotions, in every movie you think he performs the same character. Trying to be cool is not acting!The other protagonist played by Robert de Niro is very similar to Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver). It's very sad to see that Mr de Niro, one of the best actors ever, accepted all scripts he became in the last years, without considering the quality of the movie.Tony Scott made some of the most interesting films of the last two decades and like his brother I think he can still surprise us in the future.The soundtrack inlcudes Nine Inch Nails, one of the most influential rock band of the nineties!""The Fan"" is not a bad movie (at least it's not boring), but perhaps prescindible and personally I expected much more, considering the cast and the direction."
2,Forget this one!,"I don't know what Bob de Niro was thinking about while making this movie...it's flat, flat, flat...if you think you're his biggest FAN then try to forget this movie!"
2,A Disappointment,"I thought a film directed by Tony Scott ans starring Robert de Niro would be worth watching. Unfortunately, I was wrong.Do not waste your time or your money on this one."
2,FAIR AND A HALF,"If The Fan were a b-film with unknown actors, it would be fun. Those formula horror pics are always great to watch when you need to mindlessly pass time.But the Fan is not one, so why is it made as such? You have top name actors, and a big location San Fransisco shoot. But when a demented baseball fan, abuseive and estranged from his family, becomes obsessed with a SF Giants star and kidnaps his son, so what?'Everything here is freeze dried. If you watch DeNiro inThe King of Comedy, the stalking angle is the same, but there is so much unique, it is extremely compelling. This fan is juat a batch of loser cleches- nothing is done to make this charactor more than a garden variety sociopath.There is even a police chase at the end. Woo, and hoo."
2,Batters Up!!!,"This ain't such a bad movie, eventhough I gave it two stars. The reason why I gave it two stars was because, at times, it got boring. But I like how Robert De Niro acted. He was a mentally ill man, that went around and gave people a taste of his baseball bat, and also stalked his favourite baseball player, Wesley Snipes.This movie should be watched by many. I thought that De Niro was just hilarious. Especially when he threatened his son's stepdad with a baseball bat.I thought this movie was pretty much an okay thriller."
4,Old school,If you think you like the blues you gotta here Pine Top. Great old school Blues. This ol' feller can still get it !
4,Strong breeze,I purchased this fan for my bedroom to supplement the A/C and the ceiling fan which does not put out much of a breeze. I need to feel the breeze in order to fall or stay asleep. This baby does the trick. I use it on medium and the amount of air it pushes is great. The high setting is wonderful too but I don't need that much air at night. It would however be the setting to use outdoors on a hot day. I really like the fan...just wish it was prettier.
3,Good overview for beginners,"I bought this book as a refresher, since I had taken a programming class several years ago and wanted to re-learn the basic concepts. This book is good for doing just that. It will help a beginner get familiar with the concepts, and it goes easy on the more complex stuff. Anyone who is interested in programing but gets scared off by books that are hard to read should read this book first. It will lay a good foundation and make other books easier to read.PROS: easy to read, use simple language.CONS: author sometimes tries too hard to simplify explanations, some typos (a couple that will stop the code from compiling)Overall, a good book. The cons, even the typos, are not that bad, you just need to be paying attention when you read."
2,Does not have a bootable CD Rom,I bought the book thinking that there was at least a downloadable version of Corel Linux on it. The Cd only starts from a windows desktop. Not to useful when you have a clean hard disk. Also it will not start with the corel linux floppy. Not to helpful to me.
5,we love maisy,Very cute book! My 3-year-old has asked to read it over and over. Helps us long for summer in these cold winter months!
4,A Great Book for understanding the struggle,I like the fact the book had easy to use charting exercises -- it gave me an excellent insights into many of my struggles and believe it can help others too.
3,heyy,"""Nothing Came Out"" is THE BEST unrequited love song ever!! the rest of it kinda reminds me of the Pixies, but whatever it's still good...."
4,internal medicine pocket guide,It is a perfect pocket sized book. But I was hoping for a little more detail or subject range.
4,No fluff,"I really enjoyed this documentary and it's lack of fluff. I am warn down by my generation's new over-the-top approach to documentary filmmaking. It is one thing to incorporate a barrage of pop music and rapid editing into a feature, or even a documentary about a band or a spelling bee, but what I really appreciated about this documentary was its refusal to mask the facts with entertaining rhetoric. The film is very blunt and gets to the point. It has something to say, and it says it - clearly. If you are looking for 50 minutes of relevant information that will leave you feeling nothing short of enlightened, this is the documentary for you."
1,Poor look at Pharmaceutical Sales,"The people who are involved in the making of this film are all very clueless. Pharmaceutical Sales is about educating phycians to make a informed decision on what to write for there patients. Reps educate Dr's, Nurses office staff and Pharmacists on NEW medications that come to market. Most Dr's that do not see sales reps are so outdated in there practice they are a disgrace to there profession. I would not recomend this film."
1,A rambling disappointment,"To say this is a ""documentary"" is to use the word very loosely. I expected this film to be about why humans are innately drawn to listening to and creating music. The reality is that it's just 74 minutes of musicians (some good, some extremely poor) rambling on about their vague notions of what music ""is"". You will learn nothing from watching this, and if I can save you $17 with this one star review then I feel like my job has been done.However, it is almost worth buying for the 40 minute uncut interview with John Frusciante included as a bonus feature. If you're a fan of John then you will really enjoy that part. It's quite a unique and raw insight into his mind."
5,A very exciting compilation!,"I agree with the previous reviewer that the last piece on this disc is somewhat lacking in character. Thankfully the rest of it is exciting as can be! I especially liked the Tam O' Shanter and the Baba Yaga. The Accursed Huntsman and Sorcerer were great too. Playing is wonderful throughout. This orchestra has one of the best string sections around in my opinion-they have a galvanized quality to their sound that really kicks! Their brass is equally impressive-powerful, but immeasureably musical and without the tasteless bite of many other orchestras. Oh yeah, their woodwinds have an amazing amount of color to their sound. Throw all that together with Oue's remarkable enthusiasm and some great symphonic works and you have one hell of a disc. Of course, Reference Recordings unmatched sound quality and Orchestra Hall's wonderfully live acoustics only add to the experience."
3,o.k,"this game is o.k. i have about 12 gameboy games, and this isn't one that i would grab immediately. if i had a choice, i would probaly choose the other one."
5,Whispers of an Archangel of Music,"This was John Farnham's first album in his solo career and this album really sold his kind of music to the worldwide public. Every song is a true gem. If I could give it more stars I would. These songs are truly his hit songs. Farnham's 'You're the Voice' and 'A Touch Of Paradise' are his two best songs he has ever created.He truly is the Archangel of Australian pop music, the king of the pop genre here in Australia. Believe me, every song is great. This is truly a release that is more than a Whisper, it is a epiphany of musical magic"
4,1980's Gem,"This is 1980s pop music..and the best of it! Every tune I enjoy.A bit overproduced...but thats what the 80's pop scene was like.I bought because I love Farnhams voice...AND..Brett Garsed,an amazing guitarist..plays on the album."
2,Disappointing,"Because I could find the Baseball America Handbook and having seen one of my classmates with it, I decided to acquire it. Although it is not a completely waste, it is disappointing.First of all, stats like wins, saves etc. are not listed. I think it is important to have some idea of the basic statistics. Secondly, I do not like the organization of players. They list players who have changed teams on their old teams, keep pitchers and position players separate which can be hard to follow at times.My biggest complaint though is the fact that they seem convinced that they know everything and that they are funny. As a result, there are quite a few snarky comments when describing players like Alejandro Machado (Nationals) that is not even close to informative and their attacks on Pat Gillick and Jim Bowden are nothing short of vicious.For a prospect handbook, this is disappointing."
2,For the price I expected more from Infinity,I am just as happy with a entry level sub as I am this mid range one. Just not that much of a difference for the price.................
3,Hardboiled novel for an short haul flight,"Given the number of serial killers who roam the US, one sometimes wonders how the police still finds time to hand out speeding tickets. In this novel yet another serial killer meets yet another hardboiled middle age policeman, who, as is nowadays standard fare, has some personal problems. (usually this problem is a broken marriage or a murdered daughter/wife or the inability to in the past having been able to protect an innocent life or a brother who in childhood went unaccountably missing. Generally, these problems are compounded by alcohol and midlife crisis. Take your pick). It goes without saying that all the women are gorgeously attractive (in such novels the obesity rate is miraculously reduced from over 50% to nearly nil).Readable, fast paced, popcorn for the frequent traveller."
1,Don't Bother,"Ms. Anderson's attitude throughout the book is condescending and smug. The list of ""commandments"" (such as ""Worship the Pilot""), speak more to a battered ego than compassion for the timid flyer. The entire tone of the book is one of disdain for the passenger, omnipotence of the crew, especially the pilot, with wise-cracking threats if one is not properly intimidated. I'm not without appreciation or gratitude for the experience of the airline pilot, the cardiologist, or the hazmat team, but I find it offensive to have it hammered into me as karmic law. Try reading Patrick Smith's Ask the Pilot, which is at once informative and thought provoking."
5,BRAUN TASSIMO WATER FILTER,"these older filters are increasingly hard to find. i used to buy them here on amazon for $10 apiece. this current price of $30 is WAY too expensive, even if they are hard to find. most sites are out of stock, but i did find the filters for my older braun tassimo machine at coffeewiz.com for $9."
1,What is up with this insane price!!!!!!!!????????????,I have purchased this filter before for $7.99 and now it is $40 what is going on? This price is completely insane. This company is full of %&*@!!!!!!!!!
3,Expensive,"This product is a replacement filter for the Tassimo brewing system by Braun. It appears they have stopped making these as they were quite hard to find and expensive for a simple filter. Other than that, installation is easy. You soak it in water for 30 minutes and then connect it inside to the bottom of the Tassimo water tank. This worked well on my Tassimo which was purchased about five years ago. I am worried though they I won't be able to find these for long so you might want to snag an extra."
2,"Flimsy, retracting needle","Back in the 90's, it seemed like I was able to use one needle a few times; but these days I am lucky to get into one pore before the needle bends. Not to mention, in order for the needle to get into the pore, I have to glue the springs in place or else the needle retracts completely and never reaches root of the hair. I agree with other reviewers that these are too costly (as the product hasn't improved any). The electrolysis kit does work but the needles prevent the success I've experienced in the past with this product."
4,Very Good,"The DVD purchased was received very quickly, and in great condition. It did say 'new' when I purchased it, and there is an episode that does not play all the way through. I'm not sure if it's my DVD player or some other problem. I can't say for sure that it is the seller's fault."
4,WHY THEY GIVE JOEY HIS OWN SHOW?,my girl wanted it so i got it but after watching it i cant believe they gave joey or matt le blanc his own show..matthew perry was the real under dog and deserved his own show and let matt guest star but anyways. isnt bad for a girl show but i still cant believe people actually supported the JOEY show . you should be ashamed of yourself if you ever seen it.....you jerks
3,Poor quality volume on some episodes,"The volume on the various episodes was not consistent. Some were normal volume, but then there would be an episode where the entire episode was in a very low volume. Other than that, Friends never disappoints!"
4,"""How YOU doin'?"", ""I KNOW!"", ""We were on a break!"" And so forth...","This season is one of the best, especially ""The One With Chandler in a Box"" when Monica goes over all of her friends' flaws in one particular scene. I also like ""...The Worst Best Man Ever"". And as you know, Monica and Chandler get together at the end of this season. Like all sitcoms, the series would eventually go downhill but it was still going strong around this time."
3,Not Enough Hands On!,"This book was more touchy-feely to me than practical. I have taught extensively in the past, and do not need a book that gives me fundamental pedagogical skills -- I already possess them.I was looking for a book that would assist me in converting a course from face-to-face to online. This book has an extensive section on the technologies required to teach online, which will be helpful to those who have never used computer before; to me, it was a waste of space.There is no discussion of merits of different instructional design methodologies, and not a lot of concrete examples of how to teach online. This is a very light book, and I wouldn't use it anywhere except possibly to familiarize upper management with the logistics of online teaching.For those teachers/professors/instructors/educators who are going to be on the front lines of online education, you can give this book a pass."
3,Good Stuff,"This short is really good and comfortable,,, The reasons I gave it 3 stars are: because it appeared to be tighter than I thought.. Here is the thing, am a big guy and I usually XXL shorts fit me perfectly, by perfectly I mean the same fit that ""white guy"" got in the product pic above. Oh yeah, it has pockets too. There is an inside ""rope belt"" (excuse my english -.-) which I found irritating.. once pulled out can't get in again!"
4,a great read,"The only thing I didn't like about this book was how Brin didn't like her power very much and didn't control it. I thought the wishsong power was very original, and even if it did follow the same basic plot, it has so many surprises that you can hardly tell it's the same basic storyline."
4,loved the outcome from Elfstones,"Length:: 0:54 MinsI thought this really was a great wrap up of the series and was very interested to see how the elfstones affected the people involved in this book, how it changed lives and exactly what the magic Brooks created was capable of."
1,these movies,I bought this for a family member who loves martial arts.i dont know if i got right disks or not.but he says alot of them are not even martial arts movies and alot of porn like stuff on them.he didnt even open the other 20 one i got cause he was so unhappy with the other 50 one.they shouldnt call it a martial arts collectio if there isnt much of that on there and all the porn.i wouldnt buy it use money for something else.
4,great value for $$,"this is a great value for money purchase.. you get 50 movies (though about 30 of them are great with remaining 20 so-so only)... it has almost all the movies in the Kung Fu 20 pack, so this is a much better buy"
2,Not So Good,I'm dissapointed in the product for the LG Rumor. The Outlook contact link is clunky and the calendar is non-existent. I can more easily link MP3's through a direct USB connection rather than use this S/W. They took over a month to ship the S/W and sent the wrong package w/wrong USB cable. I wasted my money on this.
3,Burned from the burn,"This product is a burned copy from the Warner archives. It's legit, but I had to return my first copy because it wouldn't play in my DVD player and is not designed to be played in a dvdr drive. So just be aware of this up front"
2,Poor DVD production value,"Quality of the picture was poor as if it was copied from a VHS rental. Not as funny as I remembered. Cliched writing, for a cute premise. Busy-ness did not make up for solid writing. No wonder it took so long to come out on DVD."
3,"Great movie, poor dvd","I loved this movie as a child and have looked for it on cable so many times over the years. I was really excited when I found it on Amazon an immediately ordered it. The movie arrived 3 days sooner than expected, great! However, I have just now put it in and can't believe the poor quality. It is extremely fuzzy and pixelated, I understand the original movie is extremely old however, I have a lot of older movies that have been made into dvd's that look great. Now I wish I would have waited to find this released at a different time with better quality.I give the move 5 stars, the quality of dvd 1 star, at least it played in the dvd player."
2,The Bolshoi's Weakest By Far,"The single Please is a great song and the opening song, Auntie Jean, is also good but most of this album is pretty weak compared to The Bolshoi's other work. It is mostly very lightweight and after the aforementioned songs, which are the first two tracks, it falls away badly. I really love The Bolshoi's early work, Sob Story and Giants, but I cannot recommend this at all, I'm afraid. On the bright side, some of Trevor Tanner's more recent solo stuff is really, really good."
3,OK,This book is a source of some information but it is organized into something of a hodgepodge of this and that.It does provide an inner glimpse of the dysfunction brought on by meth.There are much better books available as far as describing the biochemistry of meth and direction for recovery.Still it makes for some interesting reading.
4,Outstanding Warranty Service,"I bought this unit about 18 months ago and use it primarily as a TV. It works fine. The other day the screen started acting up--it would go black after being on for a few hours, and if I turned it off and back on it would blank after a few seconds. I went to the Samsung Web site that night, and it said this was probably a bad backlight. So I submitted an online service request.Samsung called the next morning to say that they would be shipping a brand new replacement unit to the nearest UPS Store. i would be able to pick it up in a few days and drop off the old one.Sure, it would have been better if it never failed at all, but it is hard to see how they could do a better job of honoring the warranty. Great job, Samsung!"
5,Girls fancy athletic,"My grand daughter already had a pair that fit great on her wide foot, so I bought the next size for her to grow into."
5,A weaver's classic,"This is an excellent reference book for any weaver, from beginner to expert. The weave structures are easy to follow thanks to the photos of woven samples, as well as the information to set up the loom. This book should be part of every weaver's library."
5,Wonderful!,"I only recently re-discovered the Flintstones, after being a ""fan"" when I was 7 or so, too young to understand most of it. Anyway, once I found out these were out there, I *had* to watch them all.This show centers around loudmouthed Fred Flintstone, his feisty wife Wilma, his lovable best friend Barney Rubble, and Barney's wife, Betty. Some of the episodes are funny; others are sweet; still others are both.One of the funniest episodes is ""The Hypnotist,"" in which Fred makes Barney think he's a dog and can't get him back to normal. Even the vet doesn't seem to notice he's a human. (You know, with all the new breeds of dogs, it's getting harder to tell all the time.)To the people that said there aren't many extras: you're right. But the main stuff is so great that I honestly don't mind. In fact, I can only think of one thing wrong with this set: once you see all the episodes on here, you'll want Season Two. Trust me; I speak from experience.That aside: wonderful stuff."
2,Dubbed in Quebec?,"I'm from Quebec and I must warn those interested in this DVD that some episodes are dubbed in french from France, wich is very different than the french from Quebec. It's very deceiving.Attention, certains épisodes sont en franais de France, pas tous, mais assez pour tre décevant!"
4,A GREAT COMEDY OVERALL!!!!!!!,"This show is great too! This is the very first DVD I ordered that my parents recognized. They remember the series on Saturday Mornings back in the 70's.This was one of Hanna-Barbera's first cartoons, and I think that Alan (Voice of Fred), Jean (Voice Of Wilma and eventually Pebbles), Mel (Voice of Barney), and Bea (Voice of Barney's wife, my favorite character, Betty) all were perfect for their parts.It was so exciting! We watched about 3 or 4 episodes a day. I love this show, and I look forward to when I have enough money to buy Season 2!My Score: 8 out of 10 4.5 out of 5"
2,"Great show, lousy extras","I bought this DVD because of the extras. I was particularly interested in the history of the Flintstones. What I got was terrible. The so-called history was nothing more than a number of poorly put together clips from the show interspersed with a few comments that really provided no information. I think it was misleading and unfair of the producers to suggest that this DVD provide anything other than the show.(OK, the pilot, The Flagstones, was somewhat interesting) Don't get me wrong -- I love the show and will watch the episodes. But you need to be forewarned."
2,Canned Laughter,"There are lots of reviews on the quality and material contained within, nothing different to add. I bought all seasons.The last time I saw one of these shows I was a kid. I had forgotten how much I *hate* canned laughter. It's especially stupid on animated shows - think about it...I'll sell it cheap.Randy"
2,Dubbed in Quebec? Yeah right!,"I used to watch ""Les Pierrafeu"" (The Flinstones), every day at noon. Of course, as a young francophone, I watched the episodes in French. When I saw that the 1st season dubbed in Quebec was available, I rushed to the store to buy my personal copy. It didn't take me long to realize that the voices were not the one I used to know. Out of 28 episodes, 5 were dubbed in France. For a big fan of the Flinstones from Quebec, it is unacceptable. Moreover, I know that the episodes dubbed in France have been dubbed in Quebec as well. Now, I'm stuck my serie because the store doesn't want to have it back now that it is open! What a mistake. I hope they will correct it so I can hear the Fred I used to hear."
3,A new band with the same sound,"I am new to the punk scene, and frankly, I thought that these guys were the bomb . . . until I heard that all of the other bands sound exactly like them. Don't get me wrong, it is still a fun CD to listen to, but it isn't incredible. It has a lively sound, along with a few sad love song. I find myself singing lyrics to other songs that they don't belong to, just because they all sound alike. If you're looking for something you can jam to or drive around blasting so that everyone knows you are punk, this is the CD for you . . . but if you are already into punk, you've basically have the CD already."
3,Nothing new,"Though I agree that this album is full of melodic pop punk and does lend itself to singing along with the lyrics, it is, nonetheless, nothing new. This album lacks something that other bands (like MxPx or Goldfinger) possess. If you are looking for something to catch your attention, this is not it. If you are looking for another CD to add to your collection, this is worth the money (just don't expect to be blown away.) I did enjoy the CD and I still continue to listen to it. It is a fun CD, just be aware that it is nothing special."
3,60 Minute DVD,The DVD had good interviews with folks who are terrorist. It shows how dedicated and driven they are to their views. The DVD is way to short in run time for the cost. I would not buy it again.
3,NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE BOOK,"This film offers a good overview of what happened when NBC chose Jay Leno over David Letterman and Letterman moved to CBS. However, many of the inside details in the excellent book aren't even touched upon in this film. And parts of many scenes are fictionalized for ""dramatic"" purposes; others are altered from the book.Also, the Leno and Letterman characters are played as caracitures, and just don't ring true. Overall, the movie is poor quality and poorly edited and directed. But it isn't without its moments.In other words, read the book."
5,The Late Shift,Two thumbs up on this movie if your a Letterman or Leno fan this is a must see movie! deifinately a must see.
2,More Like a Long Music Video,"I didn't like this. I tried and tried to watch it all the way the through but I couldn't. The music was good but I was tired of hearing it. They broke out in some kind of musical number every 10-15 minutes. They told the story both threw acting and music, which is ok, but I was tired of it. I dont want to listen to rap music for hours. The movie description and the movie itself seemed not to match to me either. I don't know. Redo the movie and remove the music and you might have a pretty good show."
4,property,"proudhon didn't mean all property is theft. he didn't advocate no owner ship. He is indicating that the labourer-boss relationship is bad. that the laborourer deserves the fruits of his work and that they should not be taken away for the sake of making money to the boss and the people on the top of the hiearchy, one of the concepts that anarchism opposes."
2,Obscures at least as much as it clarifies,"I'm not sure what audience this book is written for, but it isn't me. Randall finds it necessary to provide analogies for almost everything she says. Unfortunately, these analogies add to the length of the book, but not to my understanding of the physics she is trying to explain. They come across as ""dumbed down"" and condescending, and as with all analogies they carry the risk of being misleading and inaccurate. I completely lost patience when I encountered the sentence, ""More of something (like lead pipe or dirt or cherries) is heavier, and less of it is lighter."" (p. 309) Really?I will look for some of the other books reviewers have mentioned to see whether they accomplish what I had hoped this book would - provide me with a reasonable understanding of current physics without requiring that I take several math courses."
1,Hoping for the best,"Lisa Randall was on with Art Bell in Feb 2006 and I thought she was fantastic (an obviously brilliant, straightfoward, sensible female physics professor from Harvard!) ... until she started gushing about Al Gore and babbling about global warming. I'm trusting the other reviewers' outstanding reviews and taking a chance buying Randall's book ... but if it's larded with any Gore-type nonsense, I will return it."
5,Excellent book,"Lisa Randall's book is written as brilliant as Richard Feynman's ""QED The strange theorie of light and matter""!!!"
1,"poorly designed, easily damaged.","Check the floor display of this model very carefully before buying, and you're likely to see that the screws holding the table legs and chair legs have penetrated the opposite surface. Yikes. This set looks so sweet in the store,but once I got mine home it was a NIGHTMARE to assemble. Even with very careful attention to detail, the screws still popped through the legs splintering the cheaply made product. Save yourself the hassle, folks."
3,"pay attention to screws to the table & chairs, can easily be mixed up","Make sure you are using the right screws for the table and chairs. If you use the long screws on table, the wood will bulge and crack. Pay close attention to the chairs too. I had the misforture of not having enough of the right screws for the chairs & I only put one chair together initially. I called the 880 number & asked for the correct screws, they said the screws will be shipped in 2 to 3 weeks (too long, for fixing their mistake). Other than that, the table & chairs look good."
5,Great book!,This s such a fun book for anyone who is a fan of Dr. Seuss. All phases of his long career are addressed with lots of illustrations.
3,pictures too small,"Cohen is obviously an avid collector of Seuss, and for that I greatly admire him. I am also VERY grateful for Cohen's effort to recover lost Seuss writings in his new book, The Bippolo Seed and other Lost Stories, because I remembered some of those stories, yet could find no record of them. THIS book, though, was a disappointment, mostly because the illustrations are so small. Perfect for Who's, but too tiny for my aging eyes. Also, while I'm sure Cohen was diligent and honest in his research, his interpretations of Ted's work seem presumptuous considering he, as he says in the book's introduction, ""learned about the man almost exclusively from an intensive study of his work as it appeared in original sources,"" and not from any formal interviews of the man or those who knew him."
2,Sorry for Blink fans,I went to 3 DATES on Pop-disaster and Green Day just blew away a very weak Blink 182 everytime me and my friends didnt even stay for all of blink's preformance for the last show in Oakland we were tired of singing and moshing to gren day's set. Even Jimmy Eat World blew them away hell even Kut U up blew them away. I'm sure little kids could care less if they saw a good live show or not (majority of blinks fans now are under 12) but if you are a little older and have seen some great bands live then you know the difference between somebody good or even great and a band that doesnt put on a good show. The only reason i went to this concert was cause of green day and jimmy eat world. I dont know how blink could even attempt to close out shows night after night when they were getting blown out of the water and everyone was tired from jumping around to all the Green Day classics which were played perfectly. Well Blink brings this dvd down a few notches.
5,"Review by Pascal Lee, SETI Institute","Al Harrison's book ""SPACEFARING"" has the qualities of an instant classic. It deals brilliantly with the central element in our ventures into space, the human being. It is a book about human factors in space. The work has the thoroughness and completeness of an academic treatise, but still reads easily. It is packed with little-known anecdotes and many cool historical and technical facts. The book's clear organization is particularly helpful, not just for guiding the layreader through a complex subject, but also for serving as a quick reference for space exploration professionals needing to read up on a specific topic. The book offers both a summary of lessons learnt and an analysis of our possible spacefaring future. For planners of a human mission to Mars, this is an ideal synthesis of where we stand on the subject of human factors."
3,Waste of a dragon,"I borrowed this book from the library thinking it was about Caillou imagining he was a prince going on adventures with a dragon. My son's current favorite song is ""Puff the Magic Dragon"" so I thought 'What fun!' Nope, it's about Caillou wanting to marry his mother. And while this may be something that comes up in some children's lives, I can't quite figure out what it is about the dragon - other than the fact that it is described as 'wise' - that convinces Caillou he can't marry his mommy. What a waste of a character that could have been part of a wonderful, imaginative story!"
3,A Most Unusual Caillou Story,"This story starts out with Caillou witnessing his Mommy giving his Daddy a kiss. He wants to know why it is that Mommy doesn't kiss him the same way that she kisses Daddy. Mommy tells him that it's because they're married and Caillou says that he wants to marry her too.His Daddy tells him a story about Prince Caillou, who wanted to be just like his father the King. He goes on a journey and meets a wise, old dragon.This Caillou book is fairly nicely illustrated, like others. It's done somewhat in the older style of the series, but with nice coloring. But this is a story about Caillou wanting to marry his mother and it just seems a bit odd. Caillou normally deals with very real situations. I think most kids wouldn't identify with this story and would just find it odd. They might get a laugh, though, out of the idea that Caillou wants to marry his Mommy."
3,Another in the clicks_+_cuts series,"When Mille Plateaux issued the clicks_+_cuts compilation 2CD set in 1999, it made a bold attempt at capturing an entire genre of digital music in one swoop. The albums which have followed since its release have virtually all been an extension of that sound, and Neina's ""Subconsciousness"" is no exception. The album starts off wonderfully delicately with ""Iris-In"" and progresses into several areas of DSP glitchery. There are virtually no melodies to be found here, mainly just processed sounds and filtered noises organized in a rather freeform manner. Many of the tracks recall the repertoire of Oval and owe quite a bit of the ground already covered by him. This does not make ""Subconsciousness"" not worthwhile as a release, but it does severely deaden its impact, since much of the material is so process oriented. Worth checking out if you are looking for a slice of what's new in ""microscopic"" sound, i.e. digital processing, minimal electronics and abstract textures."
1,I've been had!,"Beware the spate of books on the topic of Americans/Brits living in France! Talk about publishers milking a trend! Unfortunately, not every author is a Peter Mayle or an Ann Barry. Greene's book, for example, is hopeless--- a shambles as far as organization goes, peopled by clueless, insensitive, and incompletely delineated characters (maybe that last is the good news, because the bad news is that this is a work of non-fiction.) It is about as illuminating of the French culture and countryside as a Greyhound bus tour of the Top Ten tourist sites of the Ile-de-France.Don't be taken in by the book's title, as I was. Even we bibliophilic Francophiles have some standards!"
4,love it; sizing off,"I love this product but agree with other reviews that the sizing is a bit off. While not-pregnant I am a tall 5'10"" and lean 125lbs which would have led me to purchase the petite size; however, I used other reviews and purchased the small and have used the largest setting on it since receiving it. I am pregnant with twins so I also ordered the medium for the future. I presently am 30 weeks and around 145lbs and still using the small but it won't be too much longer to get to the medium. Would recommend this product to anyone but based on alternate sizing suggestions. I am using this belt for abdominal support and not back pain so cannot comment on its use for back pain but excellent for abdominal support. I also really like that no one can tell you have it one because it is so small compared to other options out there."
3,Meh,"I ordered this early on in my pregnancy but could never get it to fit correctly, it seemed like I was always in between a size on the notches. For $15 it's worth a shot if you have back pain but it didn't really work for me."
5,So glad I got this!,"I'm so glad I bought this for my third trimester. It made it so I could actually commute to work via the subway with my computer, otherwise I would never be able to carry that. Also, after eating, when you're feeling a bit stretched, it helps to make it so it is more comfortable to walk etc. Such a good purchase--highly recommend, especially for the price. Meanwhile, at first I thought it was too big at the 2nd setting (there are three) and too small for the first, but I grew into it, and also I found that wearing it outside my clothes like a belt was really effective to keep it from slipping."
2,Did not work for me,I received the band last week and it really did not help but made my pelvic pain worse. I ordered another one with more back support to see if that helps better. I bought a band that was a litlle bigger so I asjust it to 3 levels of tighness and none of those work for me.
3,Can't judge it yet - sizing was huge when I followed review recs,"I think that pant size prior to pregnancy is probably a much better indicator of size than weight is. I haven't changed size much other than growing a belly, but I weightlift fairly heavy when I'm not pregnant so I always look big on the weight charts. (5'5"", 175, size 4-6 before preg). I took feedback from all of the reviews that indicated it was sized too small though, and got a medium. It's so big, I could practically hula in it. I'll keep this one and maybe I'll need it later (am 29 weeks now) or I can give it to a friend, but just ordered a small for me. Am bummed - was really looking forward to getting it and wearing it, which is somewhat depressing on its own."
4,Worth the $,"During the last trimester of my pregnancy, the baby was sitting really low and my hips hurt all the time. I ordered this and started wearing it whenever I had to be on my feet for a while or when I exercised. It felt like it took some of the pressure off my hips. However, I did not think it was comfortable to sit or drive while wearing it. The size chart is accurate and it was easy to wear. No one could tell it was under my clothes. I weighed about 190 pounds during my third trimester and I wore the medium (never had to use the loosest eyehook closures)."
3,Upper limit on weight is iffy,"As I passed the 200 lb mark, the belt got more and more uncomfortable to wear. The middle setting was too tight, but the largest setting slipped right off me."
1,Yuck!,"I wish I had returned it but now it's gathering dust. There are only 3 spots where it can be adjusted so just hope that your particular size works with one of them. They are too far apart. So if you pick one and it's too tight, the next one is going to be too loose. It wasn't comfortable at all. At least Velcro is more adjustable to various sizes! Would not recommend!"
5,Great choice,"I am happy having this comfortable support while working as massage therapist. I was afraid to get too small and prior buying read a lot of reviews about sizing. If you are really petite, do not buy S buy XS size. Exception - if you are petite and overweight or gaining too much too fast while pregnant."
4,Belly Band,"Other than sizing I am very happy with product. I am 195 lbs, ordered a medium should have ordered a small."
2,"Fits fine, just doesn't DO anything.","I bought the medium as I was solidly in the weight range listed and it fits just fine- I alternate between using the middle tightness and the highest tightness setting with no problems.Unfortunately it doesn't offer any pain relief for me. My hips and pelvis hurt just as much with it on as with it off. I keep trying it and hoping, and while it does make me feel a little more secure when I'm walking around, it really doesn't lessen the pain any."
2,Too Small!!,"I ordered the petite size.I was size 0 (pants) before my pregnancy, and 122 pounds at the time of ordering it.On the biggest setting (using the first set of loops) it is still too tight!!!I should have ordered the small! Cant use it as it hurts me so I cant say if it really works or not."
4,Discrete support,"I am 5'6"" and 147 lbs, 29 weeks along. I ordered the medium, too large now but adequate in the tightest setting and should fit perfectly in another 2 weeks. This seems like a solid product with enough compression, and the most discrete design for working moms. It would get an extra star if the product could be found in black for total discretion. Unfortunately the slim profile that is the best design feature also works to create a bit of muffin top, still preferable to a bulkier material that would look more lumpy under clothes. Sitting down with band does cause belly to lift, which will probably feel uncomfortable soon, but so will an increasingly drooping belly."
2,Fits weird,"Didnt fit well. 5'3"", size small pregnancy clothes, and 140lb at 40 weeks, this never seem to fit comfortably. Would recommend they put more adjustment hooks on so the gaps are not spaced out so far from one another."
1,No Back Pain Relief from this Belt!,"I am 35 weeks and started getting mid to lower back pain on one side only a couple of weeks ago. When I went for a prenatal massage and evaluation - its just a knot in my back that's formed from the baby's weight and its pressing down on part of a sciatic nerve. I researched and thought I'd buy this belt because I saw the good reviews - I'm 5'5, started at 118 and am now 145 so the medium was the right choice but the belt doesn't help anything.I took it on vacation with us when I knew I'd be walking alot, wear it at my desk at work, wear it in the car, etc. but it doesn't help the pain at all and its not really supporting anything. I think something with a broader back brace and possible straps would work better so I'm going to buy the Soft Form and see if that works - sadly I threw away the packaging on this piece of crap so I can't return it - $ down the drain...sigh and no back pain relief. =("
2,Didnt help,I bought the mini cradle because I was getting bigger and needed support to hold my growing belly. This didnt help much. Sometimes I thought I felt the support but it didnt last long. The belt also kept biting into me and that hurt. I felt it should have been a tad broader.
2,Didn't help me.,"I've been having problems with the muscles in the top of my belly spreading, and causing sharp pains. My OB suggested a belly band to help take some of the pressure off. Unfortunately this produce did nothing for my pain. I gave it two stars because it was relatively comfy and I didn't buy it for what it was intended. It didn't help me in the least though."
1,Didn't do anything,"Got this when I was about 8 months pregnant to help give me some back pain relief. Didn't do anything for my back or anything else and it was really uncomfortable, the fabric isn't very soft to the touch and was stiff, felt like fabric cardboard. Waste of money."
3,"Helps, but....","I bought this item because I was having some muscle strain or tightness in my lower belly during exercise. It helps for minor exercise (ie., a short walk), but when I walk too much or exercise too hard it only helped for a little while. It's worth the money, but maybe I need something with extra support."
4,Great for light support,"I ordered this early in my 8th month, and it helped a lot with the pelvic pain I was having because of the weight of my baby. It took pressure of my back too, and I liked the hook-and-eye closures. I was really pleased with it except for 2 things: 1. You have to wear it over something (either full panel pants or a long camisole) because it's kind of scratchy, 2. It's uncomfortable to sit with it on, especially on longer car rides.For the price it was definitely worth it though."
4,get the one that fits your size.,it works well but i don't agree with others who say get the larger one. i did and had to get the one smaller as it wasn't strong enough to hold up what i needed.
4,"Nice belt, order size up.","I initially assumed I would be a medium, because in general, I am always a medium. When I read the description of 180+ I was thinking maybe I would order a small...but most reviews said they fit small. Before pregnancy I am 5'8"" 155# - and I am no where near 180# even while pregnant. This fits on the tightest strap, and it's a little snug. I'm sure over the next couple of months, I'll have to let it out a bit to the next strap. So, I think this fits perfect and will last the rest of my pregnancy. Their sizing is just a little wacky."
4,Relief!,"It was recommended to me by friends to get some sort of back supporting product because of my 'petite' size and frame. I figured I couldn't go wrong for the price and the mini appealed to me since the width would be more appropriate for my size.I put this on and immediately felt relief! It helped improve my posture and help keep my shoulder blades on my back to reduce tension. I did see complaints about the size, but the elastic will relax as you get bigger if you wear it everyday. If the last hook fit then it will fit as baby grows!"
2,Sizing is TOTALLY OFF!,"I ordered the petite size 90-135 Pounds. I weigh 120 pounds and am at 28 weeks. I figured by the time I reach the end of my pregnancy I would be at or under 135 pounds (my end weight goal is 130-135 pounds according to my Dr.). I just received the prenatal cradle, and I can only hook it to the last notch. Even at the last notch, its super tight! So looks like the sizing is totally off!!!I'll obviously have to return it as there is no way I am going to be able to wear this for the next three months!!! Very unhappy, as I was really looking forward to wearing this belt and having some relief from the constant back pain."
5,2nd generation,"I used one when I was carrying my daughter and now I got one for her. I was so glad to see that it is still made! This really helps relieve the pulling feeling under the ribs and back pain. I agree that it runs small. My daughter is 5'8"", 143 pounds at 36 weeks and it is getting uncomfortable on the middle setting."
4,My favorite single from the ALL FOR YOU album,"Great Song Good Remixes, My only complaint is that this is the edited version. I don't always approve of cussing in songs but, this one just sounds better with the cuss words. The edits are irritating when they bleep out the profanity."
5,Good Quality,Came on time. Good Quality. Sturdy. What more do You want me to say. I would recommend that if this is what you are looking for that you buy.
4,"gritty, beautiful cop story","I don't read cop books, or anything in the crime genre, including detectives. Just no interest. I started 'Night Dogs' working a graveyard shift and bored to tears and I took it home with me and finished it in one sit. Kent's is not an average cliche-ridden cop tale. His portrait of Portland and cops and perps is gritty and brutal and beautiful and feels through and through authentic. The story builds to it's climax without skipping a beat and I thought it was frankly unnerving. Kent's writing is easy and confident and he spins his story well. I don't read cop books because I find them so horribly cliche-bent and bland and predictable. This was none of those things. If more cop books were written to the tune of 'Night Dogs', I'd read them all. Great read."
5,for better health,very good source of vitamin A and D. Very essential for overall good health. A reliable source of omega fatty acids and for your physical health. And if you want to improve your financial health check out [....] you'll be glad you did.
3,"Good idea, but not delievered well","I like the premise of this book, I like anti-establishment type plot lines, but this is rather shallow. The ""conspiracy"" is rather lame, and the style of the writing seems to assume you are easily confused. I like that it was clear, but information was repeated too much. I don't regret reading it, but could have been better."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A President of the United States of America proposes an amendment tothe constitution that allows him to repeal the Bill of Rights, andbasically do whatever he likes. Just what all good fascists want.The current Attorney General doesn't really think it is a goodthing, but thinks is is probably controllable. Then a source tells himabout a damning piece of information that reveals what is actually atthe heart of this conspiracy.Then the thriller rolls into top gear as the two sides come into conflict."
4,Comfort in the Written Word,"The author focuses on issues of role reversal, guilt, dignity and redemption in her mother's Alzheimer's disease. I found the book clear, well-written and helpful. While the family is Jewish the discussion is universal. The author never is painfully, self-pitying. Ms. Zeiger stays relevant to her subject. Not an easy subject, harder to live through than read about. For anyone who is a child of a parent with dementia or mental illness."
5,And The Oscar go's to ! Fern Michaels,"The Crown Jewel : Is A book you can't put down,Sunshine Palm Tree's and Hollywood Glits . Fern's story telling is beyound word's ... There are so many book's that Fern has written that are all in my heart! ""Sins of Omistian , Vegas Rich,Texas Rich,and Kentucky Rich,"" though i have to say this new book Crown Jewel is a one of a kind .Every book I read gives me a small vacation everyday and this book gives you many places to go! Sit back grab a Hot cup of tea and a few cookies and find that cozy soffa and read this book and enjoy your vacation one page at a time .Douglas Charles"
2,Did I read the same book?,"I picked this book up on a whim without knowing anything about the author. I thought that the story had some promise, but the cookie-cutter characters did absolutely nothing for me. Even worse, the dialogue was really forced and unnatural, particularly for the two brothers and the tabloid reporter. It felt like I was reading what my grandmother would say if she were trying to pretend she was my age. Overall, it seemed more like a plot for a corny soap opera written by a first-time author. I logged on to Amazon expecting to see a bunch of negative reviews and was shocked to see so many positives. Maybe somebody replaced all the pages between the covers of my copy because the story I read was boring and generic, and one of the worst pieces of fiction I've read in years."
5,Good from Beginning to End,"Really enjoyed this book, from beginning to end. Think it's one of her best."
5,A REAL ZINGER OF A STORY!,"This book had everything I look for in a book. Great characters, excellent story line. You could relate and sympathise with all of them. I laughed out loud, I reached for the tissues and I smiled. I'm hoping for a sequel. I'd like to see what happens to the younger generation. This was beyond good."
5,"Exactly what I was expecting, he didn't let me down.","This video is a winner. At his best. I also saw the one at Oxford Univ. and that was plain so-so. But the Broadway one is fantastic, I got it for my Mother's Birthday, so she can laugh even when she is sick. She memorizes them now and tells them to me. We are in kahootz now telling Jackie Mason jokes. Also, I think this material is better than his ""brand new"" cd."
4,Not all songs are 5 stars.,"Too bad Amazon does not offer samples of those songs.Try to find a sample of ""Un Poco de Amor Frances"". I bet you will like it a lot, even if you not understand english.This is one of the best songs I have heard in any language.""Mi perro dinamita"" is also fun music."
1,Get something else.,I was not happy with this product. Very cheaply made it will fall into pieces while it continues to be a constant eye sore.
2,"Great subject, fair book","There are few new insights in this book; it is little more than a chronological regurgitation of glorious Duke hoops, a few interesting vignettes about Bob Knight and Jim Valvano, notwithstanding."
3,A tabloid-like read,"While this book has some great moments it also leaves a lot to be desired. It tells the great story of Krzyzewski's boyhood, the values instilled by his parents and his neighborhood friends, his time in the army and the early years with his wife Mickie. It touches on his relationship with Jim Valvano during his loosing battle with cancer. However, way too much of the book reads like a tell-all tabloid article. I suspect that was because Coach K did not participate in this effort and the writer is struggling to get enough material to produce the book. I would recommend Coach K's own ""Leading with the Heart""."
1,A Sad Attempt At Legitimacy - Zero stars should be an option...,"Is there someone you work with who can never succeed at one job before they promote him to another, circumventing all rationale concerning ""the best person for the job""? Gregg Doyel somehow worms his way upward on his career path even though many bloggers - let alone other columnists - are superior writers and investigative journalists. This book confounds the mind. You constantly wonder ""how did someone this poor at writing ever get a book published?"". My brother gave me this as a Christmas gift. We are both Duke fans and have been since 1972. He had the best of intentions considering the title. However, my brother, who is an accomplished public speaker and teacher, would have vomited upon reading such incomprehensible drivel."
2,Good one but not the best,"I bought this frame for myself. When I first opened it I felt very happy with the picture quality, but that was short lived. My friend got a Dynex 7 inch from Best buy on the same day and belive me when he played it I was stunned by its quality. Dynex is owesome but it doens't play any movies/mp3. But I think the digital frame is not required to play all those, it is meant for viewing pictures. I would rate this 2 star as far as picture quality is concerned. It really turned off my exictement. ASTAR should have concentrated on the quality of screen, when you have the pictures in widescreen it gets streched a bit and looks bit ugly."
1,snooze you lose,"Took what I thought would be a nice set of sheets to my place in Costa Rica and have slept in wrinkles ever since. Hard to maintain, color is not vivid and am overall disappointed with this 600 thread count sheet set."
2,First Man,"This DVD was a HUGE dissappointment. I eagerly awaited the arrival of this DVD. However, when I watched it, I was astonished that it lasted a mere 14 minutes! Neil Armstrong gives ""60 minutes"" the first TV interview in decades and they make it 14 minutes long. This DVD gives you no extras either, it is 14 minutes and that is it. The book ""First Man"" went into incredible detail(sometimes too much) on the life of Neil Armstrong, but this show went in the opposite direction barely covering touching on the life and especially the Apollo 11 experience of this remarkable man."
1,Does not play..........,I live in the northeast USA. This DVD does not play on my home DVD player and it does not play in my computer's DVD drive.I am returning it to Amazon.
3,Not For Differential Equations Students!!!!!!!!!,"This is not a good book for people that are taking Differential Equations in college, but rather for people that are taking calculus and would like to get started with simple differential equations. I especially didn't like the fact that the book didn't even derive Euler's fomula for second order, homogenous differential equations, y=(e^(ax)(cosbx+sinbx)) when the characteristic roots are a+bi and a-bi. Nevertheless, this book provides a good START."
4,some funny ish,"most of it is funny, some stuff i just didnt watch more then once because i thought it was stupid, like some of the homegrown footage. there is a lot of senses fail and 1.TEN.0 stuff in it.....jeff and ace are seriously hilarious. there is a bit of the other bands. if you like the bands i say buy it but there is not a lof of NFG, RX Bandits (only one live preformance), the starting line or the movielife (R.I.P)"
4,This book grabbed me and wouldn't let me go til I found out how it ended,"What a beautiful and tragic story. It is a short book, but the pages packed. I found myself wanting to race to find out what happened and how the story would reveal itself, but at the same time wanting to savor slowly the images created by the writing. Characters all richly fleshed out, shaped by sorrow. I shall have to go back and read this again, for the pieces I know I rushed past. This could have been a totally maudlin tale, but is instead skillfully told. Lucy, her parents, Ralph, Bridget and her husband Henry (who had the one line in the book that made me laugh out loud--""As often it was, his face was empty of expression even when he spoke. 'More happens in a ham,' Bridget's father had once said about Henry's face."" I read that and hooted, for it's exactly as I had pictured him.)This book was Shortlisted for the Booker Prize. I need to go see what beat it out that year."
3,Too much guilt,"I truly enjoyed the premise of this book, a young girl's defiant scheme to keep her parents from leaving Ireland turns tragic when they mistakenly leave without her. Lucy's plan to run off and stay with a beloved servant to show her parents how badly she doesn't want to move backfires when she breaks her leg in the woods. Her parents find some of her clothing on the beach and incorrectly assume she has drowned. Heartbroken they leave their home and travel through Europe leaving no forwarding address. Lucy is eventually found and has to live with the guilt of having caused everyone, including herself, such heartbreak. The problem is she never forgives herself, she denies herself the right to any sort of happiness and it became difficult to continue to sympathize with a character so utterly guilt ridden. Maybe I should have enjoyed the departure from a typical happy ending but this book could have used one."
2,Left with an empty feeling,"A very sad story on many fronts. A little hard to get into, and once the story develops the plot does not get much better. I kept wanted to yell at the parents to get over themselves and get on with life. Losing a loved one - esepcially a child - is tragic, but eventually life has to go on. Frustrating in that the solution to happiness was so close (the parents could have come home, Lucy could have married her dream guy) and yet it seemed the author did not want his characters happy. Even after the reunion, the story leaves the reader feeling incomplete at the end."
5,A spell weaver,Well Said. The animation of the characters are as that of Anne Rices Interview With the Vampire. Mesmerizing and very enjoyable. I highly recommend. You will not be dissapointed.
3,Eh,"Not bad but certainly not the most captivating story (historical fiction or any other) I've come across. Tho I never really became involved with the characters, I did feel a strong connection to Venice. By the end of the book I felt that I could probably go there and find my way around perfectly - and i wanted to! I may try Dunant's VENUS just to give her another try -I feel she may surprise me?! We'll see."
2,Started strong but had to make myself finsh...,"I read the first third of this book very quickly. Then, I got bored. For me, the characters never fully developed and I had to force myself to finish the book. When the book did end, it was so abrupt that I thought I had missed something. I tried to like it. Sorry!"
3,Eh...,"I read The Birth of Venus and I loved it. So I'm in Target the other day, have a couple bucks in my pocket, and I plunk it down on this-she's a great author, and I loved that other book, what could possibly go wrong?A lot apparently. It starts interestingly enough, but it's either skipping events that could be vital to explaining the otherwise muddled plot (a hooker, a dwarf, and a cripple...why?), which bizarrely culminates in a predictable ending. I'll keep trying Ms. Dunant, but don't buy this book to start out with."
1,this is just [bad] pop music,"Well you would think with all the glowing reviews that this guy is someone special, well ok he can play a guitar( acoustic), so can thousands of others, its just [bad] pop and love songs , there is no depth or get go, only one track (the last )is ok and thats because he hardly sings and actually plays, otherwise this is [bad] stuff, i own over 1000 cds and this one is going bye byes, its not blues, soul, jazz,or rock its just boring and annoying, . if you like music with depth, then stay well away from this.i say listen b4 you even consider buying this. whats with edits note! do you want the truth or not?.freedom of speech , seems not."
3,Interesting but could have been more,"I found this book to be, although engrossing at times, a complete let down of what it promises from the back cover. I am disturbed that one can say it contains humour and satire when it is at most times, dark and shocking (now you all want to read it hey?). The storyline is interesting, however some of the characters really got on my nerves. Especially the main woman ( I don't recall her name) who Anthony Van Horne is besotted with. She is a one dimensional character who I think Mr Morrow gave very little thought into. There is very little about her, it seems that her role is to be just the sexy feminist bent on ridding the body of Jehovah ( and even that dead body is more intriguing. I found that I had to wade through about half the book to be fully engrossed in it, the book starts off slow,and continues to be slow."
2,"well, they can't all be diamonds","Would you just look at that cover? Now that's just a work of art. Someone put their graffic art degree to good work right there. And the summary? What an idea! The death of God, and a handful of characters from all walks of life learning to deal with it; this book appears to be clarion call for our decade. It's a pity that it's just plain badly written. Each character is mind-numbling one dimensional, to a degree that I wondered if it was intentional. No. No, it's not. The writing style itself is so drab that it becomes a painful experience to get through. Conceptually speaking, the book is excellent. Morrow has the artist's touch and envisions scenes that are both intellectually stimulating as well as aesthetically arousing. However, the characters and diction do the text no good. I wonder if it would have been better as a film.All in all, I was disappointed."
4,GREAT CD BUT COULD HAVE MORE!,"the cd was great if you like todays best music like jennifer lopez and enrique inglesias but they could have put some more songs from the concert, the concert sounded like it was a lot of fun!"
3,the jump off,this cd was tight! i think for them to jus be coming out i would recommend it to those who like to get CRUNK!!!!!!!
4,D.S.G.B.,"From top to bottom, this cd comes hard. D.S.G.B. deserves more love than they get. And with this cd going nation wide they should get their credit. This is a must cd if u like Pastor Troy or like music from Atlanta"
1,not feelin it,"Yo.... i was feelin the 'Last Suppa', but this man i dont know it aint the same DSGB. they aint representin like they did on the last one. WE KILLIN EVERYBODY, A GA BLOODBATH"
4,listen to that inner voice,"this book grabbed me from the first page and would not let me go untill ifinished it.it is the story of a premeditated murder(to cover up ANOTHER crime),that is then""hushed up"" by the killer and a group of friends(""friends"" who-for their'ownselfish or self serving reasons-keep silent)...leading to the the night when ayoung lady returns to the place where they all meet to walk their' dogs and shesenses something is very wrong but,what?!?!all the dialog is smart and it has well rounded characters. some charactersreturning(in memory) to the first time he/she met the murderer and why he hasa hold over each ""friend""-each story being a bit different.this is a great one from the late velda johnston."
3,Wonderful commentary; Not very practical,"Ideally, this should be the Conservative answer to the Artscroll prayerbooks. And it tries to be. The commentary is detailed and insightful, drawing from the vast spectrum of Jewish thought and literature. Lots of different points of view. A fantastic job in this respect.I was looking for a siddur for my own use (reflecting Conservative interpretations), similar to the Artscroll. But ""Or Hadash"" is not very practical for this purpose. It reprints exactly the Sim Shalom prayer book, but in VERY small print. The commentary overtakes the actual prayers it surrounds on the page, and it looks and reads more like a textbook than a usable siddur. Contrary to the previous reviewer's comments, there are no ""synagogue choreography instructions"" beyond what was in Sim Shalom originally. Unfortunately, here the Artscroll wins out.I hope to see a true Conservative version of the Artscroll siddur some day soon."
2,Doesn't Provide Significant Relief,"I purchased the V2 supporter in hopes of relieving the vulvar varicosities that I suffer from during pregnancy. It gets so bad that walking can be agony and simple things like lifting a foot to climb stairs or tie a shoe cause considerable pain. After putting on the V2 supporter in the morning and wearing it all day I noticed two things. First of all, even though I bought the right size and tried different settings, it would not stay put. Secondly, it did not provide enough counterpressure to give noticeable relief."
4,A nice solo debut from Neurosis singer,"""As the crow flies"" is the debut solo album from Neurosis singer/guitarist Steve von Till. It's a collection of seven acoustics songs recorded in his home studio between 1996 and 1999. Althougth the sound is very different from Neurosis albums the mood is quite the same, very dark and longing for transcendance. Steve von till croons on low, repetitive melodies, building a sound quite reminiscent of Michael Gira (Swans singer) solo efforts like ""Drainland"". Not for the fainthearted but pretty rewarding if you're in the right mood."
5,"Nothing to complain about, it is just a background","The background was delivered promptly. No wrinkles, no rocks nor plants, just plain blue and black -- which is perfect. Took me a bit to figure out how to order 48inch x 28inch piece. You just have to put an order for 4 items (4feet = 4 x 12inch)."
4,An endearing hero and mouth watering recipes,"Cecile Lamalle's second entry in her culinary mystery series featuring Charly Poisson, chef and owner of the best (and only) French restaurant in Van Buren County makes an entertaining read and actually makes you want to cook! Charly, very French and vey quirky, is also an amateur sleuth, much to the chagrin of local law enforcement. When the seeming suicide of Patty, the pastry chef's friend, Amanda, turns out to be murder and the county is hit by a series of antique thefts, Charly is drawn into the search for the culprits. Mix in the mob and you have a situation that could turn out to be very dangerous. Both the believable characters and the mystery make a very agreeable diversion."
2,Disney marketing at its finest,"I bought this book thinking it would really help, but it felt like Walt Disney himself wrote it.I want the real dirt, not some PR person's take on it. It did have info on peak and off-peak times, which I liked, but overall I would recommend the unofficial guide"
3,A text that's streighforward but dated and unexciting,"I had this book for First Year Russian. It's probably not the best book for beginning Russian. It's somewhat old with no pictures, games, cultural information, or the other types of things you might find in a modern textbook. However, it did the trick and helped to propel me into what would eventually become my major in college."
5,"Sweet, charming and funny","This book had it all, and from a new writer, no less. I read Ms. McCoy's first book and liked it so much I decided to get the second one. You're the One had me laughing throughout and crying at the end. The characters are so real, even though one is a ghost, and their reactions to circumstances are on the money. I can't wait for September 2002 and her next release."
3,Only for small birds,"Much smaller than as pictured. Only small birds come to the feeder. Larger species (cardinals, etc...) come to the feeder, flap around and then leave... cannot fit in! Otherwise nice for the kids to watch birds eatting only inches away! You can see them split open the seeds!"
5,Wonderful feeder,I have purchased several of these over the years and really enjoy watching the birds feed while sitting in my family room.
1,Boring and Tedious,"Boring! Who cares about what happens to Anna Wulf? It's one of those books that when you read them, you KNOW you are reading a book, and you feel annoyed that you are wasting precious time for not reading something else more interesting. I like books that make me forget the time and the world. This is not one of them."
4,Great book indeed,"I admire Doris Lessing's style and prose. With that, yes, I enjoyed the book. The detail, insight, frailties and humor are wonderful. I stopped short of five stars - my opinion only - because I would have preferred a shorter version. The author, however, makes no apology and rightfully so for it's length. I would recommend this book to young men and women who want to validate their own emotions and understanding of relationships, and to older women and men to better understand where their relationships have taken them. I am now ready to read more of Doris Lessing and her wonderful style."
2,Extremely overrated,"I had tried so hard to plow my way through this book. I read and reread and printed reviews and pep talked myself...but in the end, around page 299, I found myself putting it back on my shelf. In her introduction, Lessing states that readers shouldn't force themselves to read books they aren't ready for, and if they feel no desire to finish a book, they shouldn't. I'm following her advice and putting the book away.I have to give Lessing credit for the style of writing. The various notebooks offer a compelling way to learn about a character. My problem is that the character is boring, self centered, and unemotional. The plot is unremarkable."
1,Story Line was hard to follow,"Very boring with no captivating story lines. Hard to follow... mental weariness..tiresome...uninteresting.... If I am going to spend time reading a thick book, it has to captivate and pique my interest, not put me to sleep,,"
2,Houses from Decades Past,"My wife and I were disappointed with the plans. Many seemed old and outdated. Although there were a few interesting designs, most of the newer designs were for homes >3000 square feet."
5,Not Just For Girlz,"This book was extremely realistic and forthright. The dynamics of the relationships between the characters was true to life. I recommend this book to anyone who appreciates suspense, love, friendship, and the hardships of relationships that are not ""perfect"". Both the female and male points of views are represented in such a way that both genders will be enlightened by Lucio Dutch's phenomenal book."
1,nothing new,"This book is just ANOTHER rehash of their first Carbohydrate book. They sure are milking this for all it's worth! Instead of offering something of substance with each subsequent book, they put all their effort into catchy new titles."
4,good starting point,If you have young kids i'd recommend this book. Being a young parent and not having a huge amount of financial knowledge I found this very helpful.
1,Junk...pure and very simple,"All I can say is that she's not her mom. This was one of the worst books I've ever read.From a stupid premise to unbelievable characters it really stunk.I'll stick with her mom from now on.....However, it did stick in my head so it must have had some sort of impact on me....funny how that happens."
1,I put it down!,What a disappointment. I have read this author's work in the past and found several of her books very enjoyable. This book is miserable. I read 3-4 books per week and I have NEVER failed to finish reading a book. This is a first. I've been reading the book for the past week and a half and I finally realized that I just don't care what happens in the end. I put the book down at page 175 and I am not even slightly curious about what happens. This one is going straight to the used bookstore for trade in!
1,"So horrible, I didn't even finish it.","A mystery based on a cable network dedicated to Hot Air Ballooning? Is CHC serious?I couldn't even believe this dreck was published. All of the characters are totally unbelievable and impossibly named. Even in my worst, food-induced haze would I EVER come up with Aunt Agony and Uncle Heartburn.CHC must be on drugs. This was worse that Robin Cook's ""Shock"". At least I finished that book.I'll stick to Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series. While I have issues with that series as well, at least it's entertaining."
5,All 12 seasons out on DVD! Amazing!,"Wow is all I can say about this massive set of 72 DVD featuring 279 episodes! That is roughly 206 hours of viewing pleasure! Just amazing that it is possible to own the whole series in one shot! Obviously I have not had time to review the whole set maybe I will do that again in a year when I get through it all! So far series one is digitally restored and it looks and sounds great! This show really holds up with beautiful locales and lots of action. It is one of longest running TV shows in history! If you loved it the first time around you will love this set. I got the entire set for $140 from amazon! What an amazing deal it was a little over $11.00 per season for me. Great Show, Great price, Great Quality = Great Deal"
1,Folks: please do not buy cheap things ...,"A long sad story: we ordered this wine cooler at the beginning of January and it was supposed to be delievered in middle January. Well, they shipped the WRONG cooler (Haier HVFO60ABL 60-Bottle). We complained at Amazon.com and I have to say they promissed to replaced it with the right one. Today ...they delivered... only that this model is HORRIBLE: temperature setting works randomly, the cooling unit is extremely noisy: we can hear it from upstairs and our house is really big.Folks, my father, when asked by someone why he is buying expensive things, he answered simply; ""I am too poor to buy cheap things!"". Too bad I myself forget these very deep thought sometimes.PS Too bad that Amazon does not have start the star counting at minus infinity. That's where this piece ... is at. And too bad Amazon is doing business with these kind of companies."
5,Fantastic,I've owned Salesmen and Racists for a number of years and just recently purchased Ike's new album.I've had this cd in my car stereo on continuous play practically ever since.Rock and roll simply doesn't get any better than this.
4,Touching human story,"Philadelphia deals with an AIDS-stricken homosexual attorney, played by Tom Hanks, who brings a wrongful-dismissal suit against the firm that fired him. It's a wonderfully sympathetic tale that did wonders in increasing understanding of people suffering from AIDS in the early 90s, and a magnificent display of acting by Hanks and Denzel Washington. The film shows just how easy it is for society to dismiss someone at a time of greatest need, and how wrong it is to do that. The film, along with Bruce Springsteen's title song, has aged well in the intervening years and remains relevant today."
4,THIS MOVIE WAS AIGHT.,"IF THIS MOVIE TEACHES US ANYTHING IT'S THAT ANYBODY CAN GET AIDS IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL...SEX PARTNERS, NEEDLES, EVEN THE DENTIST.REMEMBER TO ALWAYS PROTECT YOURSELF, GET TESTED ONCE A YEAR (DON'T WORRY IT IS NOT THAT BAD), AND WRAP IT UP!ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIVE IN ILLADELPHIA...THAT'S PHILLYPEACE TO DENZEL YALL (THAT OSCAR CAME MAD LATE AND OVER DUE BRO).AND TOM 'BANKS' HANKS WAS RIGHT ON THE MONEY IN HIS ROLE TOO.ONE!"
5,no title,"Another movie with sniffling and Kleenex. Tom Hanks, as I foresaw in ""Big"", is absolutely superb. Another comic, like Robin Williams and Bill Murray, with marvelous depths. And yet the movie is not really about a man with AIDS, as all the critics say it should be, and then berate it because it isn't; it's about society's reaction to gays and AIDS, a much broader subject. On that scale, it delivers well. We don't need detail scenes of Tom Hanks and his lover, or his facing the disease, or any other of the nitty-gritty the critics said was lacking. I think they missed the point entirely. Washington was society, and his slow progression from homophobia to understanding is what Demme is trying to say to the audience. And, increasingly, I am thinking, we should be out there, living life, helping people, instead of watching them on a two-dimensional screen. Maybe movies really distance us from life, instead of imparting more knowledge."
4,Movie with human touch,THis is great movie and I loved it.It removes the apprehension and hat we have for homosexuals and people who suffer from AIDS.The movie is not just about lawsuits and prejudice but also about human acceptence.Gays are just like us but only have different hormonal instincts.If we can forgive everyone who are not gay for their human weakness why not accept gays as they are.Great acting by Tom hanks but the spotlight is Denzel as well who is equally great in acting.Hats off to both of them ...Great actors
2,Not New for David Weber,"I was very disappointed to start reading and found out the first story by David Weber was taken out of a previous David Weber book of short stories, ""Changer of Worlds"". I thought I was going to get a new story about Honor Harrington. Eric Flint's story was very entertaining. It was a continuation of the Belsarius alternate history. David Drake's continuing tale of Hammer's Slammers is always graphic, but Mr. Drake has tried to impress upon his readers that war is not neat and clean."
2,I didn't care for this coffee,This coffee was very forgettable. Not much more flavor than Folgers or Maxwell House. I would not buy this product again or recommend it.
5,"That gal in the other room has captured my interest, too","I am, admittedly, a Diana Krall fan, but I decided to expand my horizons and see who else is out there. Elaine Elias, why haven't we met before? You've given some great treatment to some great tunes on here, like ""Call Me,"" ""Baubles, and Beads,"" ""That's All,"" and ""Tangerine,"" not to say what Carlos Jobim would think of your rendition of the title track. For you jazzers and/or samba lovers, don't pass this up; and for you listerners who just like to hear some nice smooth singing with tasteful piano accompaniment without regard to genre, this is simply your cup of tea. Elaine's voice and her piano playing has made me a fan for sure."
3,For CLEP tests this should not be you only resource.,These reviews on Economics Cliffs Quick Review are outdated. Do not take the econimics CLEP tests if you have never taken a CLEP test before. If you want to take the Economics CLEP tests and you want really high grades you can go ahead and buy this book but it should not be your only resource. You should buy the REA guide(s)CLEP Microeconomics (Rea) - The Best Test Prep for the CLEPCLEP Microeconomics W/CD (Rea) - The Best Test Prep for the CLEPfor these CLEP tests which are not out yet but should be available in about 3 months. Yes these reviews are outdated-since then they have added questions about externalities which are not well explained (for CLEP test purposes) in this book. Be careful. Don't get in a hurry. By all means be patient and get the CLEP credit that you deserve!
3,If you like Bruce then this is for you.,"This is a very nostalgic look back at when Bruce Brown started making moviesin the 50's until he finished with Endless Summer 2. There are several great cameos by Dave Velzy, Greg Noll, and Robert August(just to name a few) who tell the viewer about their experiences with Brown and the movies they made together. It unfortunatley is only 70 minutes long. It has great out takes from ES and ES 2 and a short blooper series that is classic. I only gave it 3 stars because it didn't have enough surfing and it wasn't long enough."
1,"Awful, awful","Whoever gave this project the go-ahead needs to be lobotomized. Seriously, what a waste of two dollars. Don't watch this piece of crap."
5,Good,"I think people judge this film the wrong way.This ain't Citizen Kane or Pulp Fiction, but it does what it says on the tinIt's good, family entertainment. The Duo of Charlie and Lewis is brilliant, and comical, and Estella Warren is both a great actress and gorgeous :PDefinitely and good friday night and also a real good feel good movieGreat fun, pick it up."
1,Kangaroo Krap,"I saw this on a bus from Shaoxing to Hangzhou. Dubbed in Chinese with Chinese subtitles, and I was listening to THE LIVE ALBUM by The Charlie Daniels Band. I didn't need the sound to know this movie is horrible. Lemme quit editing my books and write a new one about kangaroos wearing sunglasses, and Mafia money, and funny Hollywood fat guys being funny Hollywood fat guys, and farts. Lots of farts. Shakespeare, Lu Xun, Dickens, James Joyce, Dr Seuss -- didn't they all insist on at least seven fart jokes per page?"
1,Should be PG-13,"Personaly, I DID NOT like this movie. Even though most of it takes place in Australia, the plot is thin, there is some sensual content, and plenty of nasty language. The Kangaroo gave it some redeeming value, (I like kangaroos) But not enough for 2 stars. I don't recommend it, but if you DO go see it, I can almost bet you wont see it twice!"
1,"False Advertising, isn't that illegal?","If you're hoping for a movie about a TALKING kangaroo who also likes to rap, you're in for a big let down. In fact, he does not speak in the movie at all. That's right folks. I don't know what they were thinking. Was it too unrealistic? Maybe. But in a film like this who really cares about why a kangaroo would talk in the first place. It was supposed to be a ... of last years Scooby Doo, which was also horrible, but ended up making big business at the box office. It seems trailers have gone from showing you too much of a movie to showing you stuff that isn't in the movie at all. I don't know about you, but to me that's not getting what you pay for.Don't be complacent. Please complain."
5,Weatherbox!!!,"Suchhhhhh an amazing band. I highly reccomend this cd. It's an album that never gets old. I'm a San Diego local, as is this bad, and i'm fortunate enough to get to see them live in small local venues and i have to say that they are REALLY good live. Brian Warren is a genious. Buy this cd. Seriously. You won't regret it. If you asked me my favorite track right now i wouldn't be able to tell you because i like them all so so much.Also check out the song ""Is Nice"" on 4 songs ep."
2,For GWTN Collectors Only,This book is seriously lacking. The pictures are not great and the text is uninteresting. There is nothing here that you haven't seen before.
5,One of the best of Leslie's workout,"For me this was the best workout. I needed arm exercises and this fits the bill. Easy to modify to your own needs by doing 1,2 or 3 miles, and use no weights to 3 pounds what ever you choose.Was able to do the whole 3 miles by the second time. For me it has to be easy to keep me motivated and this one keeps me going."
5,New favorite,"I own many Leslie Sansone walking tapes. I like to be able to rotate them. My newest tape, Burn Body Fat & Sculpt Your Arms, is my new favorite. I like that it has 3 individual workouts on it, 1 mile, 2 miles, & 3 miles. I love that the whole workout incorporates hand weights! My arms feel great when I have finished. I am looking forward to my toned arms. :)"
3,Poor DVD quality,"I played the DVD several days later after recieving the it in the mail. Unfortunately I'd thrown away the box and packing /return order because the DVD quality is very poor. The surface is very mottled and uneven. It skips and jumps ahead about 4 mins. every 5 0r 6 mins. I know I should have checked this before discarding the shipping material. Mea culpa. Regardless, let this be a warning to those of you who are considering purchasing this product. From what I've seen of the product it is as good as the reviews here state. Only wish I had the full version."
4,Strong timeless record,"I really like this record. It is a solid, interesting set, nicely put together, very musical, just the right arrangements and instrumentations. I first started following Ms. Balint when I saw her in a free Peter Sellars, Kennedy Center, production of Chekhov's ""Seagull"" that was mind-blowing. Like Marc Ribot, John Lurie, and later Tom Waits, it's what a grown-up, less self-conscious/pretentious ""Velvet Underground and Nico"" might have sounded like. It's not trying to be trendy or imitative, it is just a decent enjoyable record that has stood the test of time without becoming embarassing. More than you can say for a lot of other records from new artists from the same year!"
4,Depends on what you are using it for,"I am very pleased with this flex keyboard. I use it when I travel and take my laptop. My keyboard is a bit messed up on it and I use this instead. It works great for that. It also rolls up for storage and doesn't take up much space at all.If you are planning to use it as an everyday keyboard however, this would not be for you. The keys are not as responsive as your typical keyboard and so you get some missed letters.All in all I am pleased with my purchase."
2,dissappointment,"I'm usually a big fan of veggie tales and all that they have to offer, but this CD was a disappointment to both my children and myself. It was quite lackluster."
1,A BIOGRAPHY OF A HIPSTER NOBODY KNOWS ?,"Why bother with a bio of hipster Terry Southern?Author tries a tongue in cheek run, but that does not work . Southern, by this account , was an alcoholic who made his living scribbling lines for B movies. Check that the author is a Canadian who does not have the slightest idea of what life was like in Terry Southern's haunts.Read this only if you wish to see what low grade stuff publishers are shoeveling onto the market these days ."
1,Poor comic book writing,"Terry Kavanagh is one writer who does the most uninteresting stories in comics. He gave us the Spider-clone saga and a teenage Iron Man. This story where he supposedly gives us the origin of one of the X-Men's most dangerous foes has now been contradicted by current stories going on in the X-Men comics and must be placed as one of those false lead stoires like those that have shown Wolverine's origins,"
2,Save your time and your money!,"Save you time and money. You can put $25 to a better use, video is cheep. Do not get me wrong, I am not saying it is inde so it is cheep, I am saying the when I sell out 25 freacking dollars I want a cood tape. Where did they come p with the PG-13? I do not think any one from the MPAA say this cheep pice of crap! Anna In The Sky is the best one on the video. Its is the only moving one. All the other ones do not have souls! I think that their needs to be a video of good shorts. Not video balls of trash! Rock on Cowboy!"
2,Not what is represented in the picture,I bought this for my son who is a big Mallard duck fan...so the detail was important. It does not have the firmness nor the detail as shown in the picture. See the other customer pictures for an accurate view of what you will get. It may work fine for a small child that is not interested in details.
3,Wonderful Town (2003),"Frankly, I got this album for one song...""A Hundred Ways to Lose a Man"", which I heard on the Braodway station of our digital cable network. I was extremely entertained by the song and loved the style portrayed in this album's particular rendition of it. I got it in order to perform the song myself for a benefit performance. I am very pleased to have it in my collection. As far as the rest of the album is concerned...one has to be ""in the mood"". It can be a bit annoying at times. Not my favorite Leonard Bernstein...doesn't compare to West Side Story...rather fluffy in comparison and silly, but that's what was intended."

2,H*A*T*E*D I*T,"Could not get the phone out with one hand! I must have missed 50% of my calls because of this case. Finally, after 5 months of use the case broke. I'm going for the side case next. Hope it works out better for me....."
1,"Junk glasses, pretty to look at, break far too easily","I bought 12 glasses each of most of this set of Mikasa a couple years ago when it was on sale from Macy's thru Amazon. Forget washing in the dishwasher, you so much as look the wrong way at these and they break. The Highball glasses are the toughest, but have had a couple of them break in my hand while washing with the mildest jar against sink. They are not durable enough to be everyday use and not nice enough to justify taking up storage space as special occasion glasses. I am VERY disappointed in Mikasa, I would never buy from them again."
5,Awesome CD,"Excellent CD. It really captures the true voices of the Temptations. I am a long time Temptations fan since the early years of the group. I always felt that, (though still talented), the group was not the same without these two great entertainers. I had no idea that they teamed up in the 80's and recaptured their unique sound until I came across one of their videos on You Tube. Excited, I immediately went to Amazon to research all of their recordings. That led me to this beautiful CD. If you love the true voices of the Temptations, this is a must have. The same great voices with a totally new sound to their music.Ruffin & Kendrick"
