5,Extremely thought provoking,"Beyond the Horizon is the story of 2 very close brothers, Robert and Andrew, who choose opposite paths in life. Each unfortunately, chooses a path better suited for the other. The deeper meaning in this play is what happens to a man's soul when he doesn't follow his dreams."
5,Love This Book,Key West History of Island of Dreams is the best resource book for writers to learn the history of Key West and the best history book I have ever read.
3,Cautiously Recommended,"This is a very beautiful volume with clear typeface. The English used is pretty antiquated, somewhat similar to what you would get in a King James Bible. This doesn't really bother me, but some readers might want a newer translation for the sake of clarity.There are a couple of things that I really do not like about this version of the Quran. First, it is a very thinly-veiled attempt to convert English-speakers to Islam. The study notes are almost categorically persuasive/polemic in nature and do little to elucidate the meaning of the text. Second, many of the study notes are also pretty anti-Semitic, which is not really a huge surprise but is also pretty disappointing for people like me who want to understand the Quran apart from the current political insanity in the middle-east."
1,Skip this one,The cover looks really nice but it was really difficult to get the thing to stay on the couch and look nice. It crumpled and bunched up every time you sat on it and the arms of the couch looks terrible and messy. Look elsewhere for a cover!!
4,"Play with ""new"" balls every time!","This ball saver really does save your tennis balls well. It's built sturdily and is based on a very simple design to keep the balls pressurized. Make sure you do not screw it all the way in, but just up till the mark for tennis balls... or else your balls will be too bouncy.For maintenance, you need to lube the O-ring every couple of months to keep it air tight."
2,Tennis ball saver??????,"Only had the tennis ball saver one month, so no long term experience. I added silicone gel to the rubber O-ring to make sure it was adequately lubricated. Good idea, if it works."
4,Okay for a teenage movie,My eleven year old son really likes this movie and talked me into watching it with him. The concepts are really good - talking about moral issues. The lessons learned at the end teach us that we don't always want what we think we do and we should be happy with what you have.
5,16 wishes,My daughter loves this movie. She is nine and got it for Xmas. It is refreshing and family can enjoy it.
4,Warfare in the 18th Century,"A good summary of the global wars and military situations of the 1700's, excellent for students or those only casually interested in the subject. I found the author's deliberate (and politically correct) focus on the wider world (as opposed to just Europe and America) informative but also a little annoying.And a warning to potential buyers - there is a book out there with this same title and author, in a series called `Cassel's History of Warfare', that is the exact same title just a different cover, so if you already have one of these books don't buy the other!"
2,Not for hardwood floors!,I bought this vacuum and it was fine on carpet (though a bit noisy.) It was awful on hardwood floors - it blew the dust everywhere. Stay away if you plan on using it on anything besides carpet!
4,son loves them,"The main tools are great and my 19 month old plays with them daily. The nuts, bolts, and nails are kind of useless because they are difficult to hold and work with at the same time."
4,Broken up,"THe toys were a lot of fun until the hammer cracked at the top and the pliers fell apart and the clap broke as well, the only thing that is left is the wooden peices"
2,good and bad,"While these gloves seemed to have great padding and look nice, the sizing is waaay off. I should have ordered at least 1 size larger, if not 2. They fit my girlfriend's hands (and they are in no way ""large"") so she has them now."
1,You got to be kidding,"This book has nothing intergrated in it. This woman who claims to write the best physiology textbooks around must be lying.Her book is [not good]. It leaves out too many details, has a bunch of senseless flow charts that tell you nothing and provides no explanation. I have a copy of her book and it is thinnner the most physiology textbooks. I wonder why its thinner then most other physiology textbooks? Well its because she does not take time to explain the physiology of the human body.She maybe a good teacher but she can't write a textbook for anything. A 10 year old child can write a better physiology textbook.I would not buy this book at all. Bad book!You want a good physiology and anatomy textbook? I recommend Hole's anatomy and physiology textbook. Hole's anatomy and physiology textbook makes Dr. Silverthorn's textbook look like something you clean your car windows with."
2,Interesting but auwfully outdated!,"I think most of the content is fairly interesting, but it is so oldfashioned. This needs a desperate update. The graphics are just awful. Not acceptable in the 21st century!"
2,Not a good buy,"It's an $8 tee made in China, 60/40 cotton-polyester and so thin I can use it as a sieve in my baking. I've seen better yet cheaper tees in our local mall."
5,vwry helpful,"This book was a great tool for a person out of school for a few years to refresh for there act. I can't speaks for the sat. I achieved an imacculate score but the book was help, not the reason. Highly reccomended but don't rely on it for everything!"
2,Great Explanations - Terrible Errors,"On the positive side, the author does a great job of explaining some complex topics in very clear down to earth terms. The clarity and style of the book is excellent. However, the number of errors is horrible. I already knew the material in several chapters, but I read them for review. I was shocked to discover error after error. In some cases, it was just misleading, in other cases it was blatantly wrong. If you just want to better understand the technologies and you are willing to deal with some errors, then this book is a good choice. But, if you want to make sure you understand exactly how the technologies work (and not be misled,) then stay away from this book."
1,"It is way out of date, full of errors and dumb analogies!","I found myself having to skip through pages and pages of dumb analogies! Theses analogies were dumb and do not clear anything up. This book's code examples for the most part are full of syntax errors that could be harmful to beginners. The examples are also way of of date. All of the code is awt based not swing like it should be and like the book proclaimed from the outset. The only swing in this book is a few notes scattered in the book that say basically ""use swing when you write this code."" So why didn't the author use swing to write the code? I think the rewrite of this book is nothing more than a few notes added to the pages and syntax full code examples that are out of date and don't work.Don't buy this book if you are a serious programmer and if you do please buy my copy."
4,*DrEaMcHiLd*,"I watched this movie today on tv, and I really enjoyed it. It lets you see a less-sugar-coated version of the story. The work of Jim Hensen was fabulous! The mad hatter and marge hare was realistic and a little disturbing as well. I would love to see the original version of Alice In Wonderland, the one where she comes back home and is on the wrong side of the mirror. Anyway, the movie was great, and I recommend it."
1,Terrible by comparison,"I have been using these strings for a while.I always went for them because they were the most expensive I could find and figured they were the best.Now I have been playing guitar for 8 years and I guess you could say why didn't you just stop buying them.Honestly, I would always just buy these guys and they last a long time but other than that they sound nothing like the D'Addario EXP16 that I just switched too. If you must buy these do not buy them at a medium gauge. They are way too rough and actually uncomfortable to play. There is a reason almost every guitar maker puts LIGHT d'addarios on their guitars. Trust me."
3,Rhino Zire 72 Aluminum Hard Case,"I liked this case except that I had the same problem with the charging cord - it does not fit easily into the socket when the Zire 72 is in the case. By carefully pushing down on the PDA, I am able to get the charging jack to fit into its socket though. I got along fine like this until the wire that holds the door on slid out and the door fell to the ground. I was not able to locate the wire so now the case is unusable."
2,Not that entertaining,It is suppose to be one of the top 100 novels but I was not fond of it - maybe a culture thing.
5,A Good Laugh,"This book had me chuckling from the first page. Ms. Burns knows her sports fans. The ""uniform"" ratings for each sport had me wondering why no one had ever pointed out before how sexy the uniforms in some sports are (baseball, football) and how some sports could stand improvement (basketball).The book also helped me to understand the fascination of a true sports fan and gave me enough insider's information that I could probably hold my own in a conversation with true sports fans.Thanks, Ms. Burns, for helping me see what the big deal is and for making me laugh."
5,Made to last!,These are one of the most comfortable shoes...You can't go wrong owning a pair of Doc's.
1,Messy,"I purchased this soap to see if it would help my acne. It didn't. Since it has some type of dark, mud like component it left a ""muddy"" mess of my shower and kept oozing for quite awhile. Despite my habit of using every bit of a soap bar, I just had to toss this one out after just a few uses."
5,DVD collection of BBC's As time goes By,"DVD set was received in great condition. I bought the set for my parents-who started watching the show on BBC, but didn't always see it in sequence--so really enjoyed getting the entire set --the stories are timeless, dialog and humor is great! I watch it too, and it beats many sitcoms that are out there now."
5,As Time Goes By - Complete Original Series,This is one of the truely great British Sit-Com series. Now you can watch them all and not have to depend on the local PBS Stations' programing schedual. Really Nice material.
5,THE BEST OF ALL BBC SHOWS,"THIS IS EXCELLENT THEATRE. THE ACTORS ARE PERFECT IN THEIR ROLLS. I ONLY WISH IT COULD GO ON AND ON FOREVER,"
5,Yum!,"My husband loves this chocolate! I'm not a huge eater of chocolate, but even I think it's silky smooth and so creamy and yummy!"
5,An Intersting Variation on the Greatest Movie Ever Made,"My family has watched the excellent DVD of ""Mary Poppins"" many times. The adults agree that taking all aspects of such a production into account, this is the finest and most satisfying movie ever made. The book, from which we assume the movie was developed, is also very good -- but different in cast-of-characters and events in intriguing and major ways. It is like a new view in many, interesting ways. I can't wait to finish it!"
5,AWESOME BOOK!!!!!!,one of the the very few books that i could read over and over. it is not like the movie at all.
2,Not at all what I expected...,"Who doesn't loveMary Poppins (45th Anniversary Special Edition)with Julie Andrews? Now normally I know better than to love a book because of a movie (or vice versa), but onMary PoppinsI really thought I was on solid ground. It was a surprisingly flat read though, and Mary P. turned out to be a lot snarkier and less fun than I thought she would be. Even the scenes that have made it into every movie/musical translation (like the tea party on the ceiling) were slow-going and filled with drudgery. Stick with Julie on this one..."
2,Uncomfortable,These are shorter than previous cycling shorts I have worn. I purchased them specifically to wear in spin class at the gym so that they would fit under another pair of shorts. The chamois is perfect for the hour or so of class and is very comfrortable. The sizing is acurate. My only complaint is the grips on the legs are horrible. I am use to silicone grippers that are much more comfortable. These leg grippers feel like a bunch of threads digging into your leg. After an active spin class I have scratches on my leg from them.I will probably still wear them but will not buy another pair.
5,A solid collection of Chicago style blues,"Compilation of two great artists, Sumlin and Branch, with some outstanding guitar work by Carl Weathersby (carlweathersby.org)"
3,More entertainment than biography,"As reviewers of African American books, my Contributing Editor and I swooped up this book for what we thought would be inside information on Terry McMillan. We weren't looking for trash; but thought that our internet readers would enjoy a biography (unauthorized as it may be) on one of their favorite authors. Diane Patrick makes a great attempt; and the biography is entertaining. However, we didn't really learn anything new and didn't appreciate the alternate ""reporter"" and ""sister-girl"" jardon dispersed throughout the book. Nevertheless, we'd still recommend the book for those who NEED to have it for their reference library, or that game of Jeopardy under the heading, ""Useless Terry McMillan Facts."""
4,Good...,"Michael Ponti is definitely a virtuoso, and it's pretty amazing that he played through the whole Scriabin catalog. I felt that his tempos were a little all over the place. His Etudes were kind of abrupt and rushed. Overall I think his interpretations were pretty consistent, and overall he did a great job. He's just not Horowitz or Richter."
4,Let's have Truth in Advertising,"A fine, inexpensive 5-CD set--but it's NOT the complete non-sonata piano works. For the 3 Etudes op. 65, 2 Poems op. 71, poem Vers la Flamme op. 72, 2 Dances op. 73, and 5 Preludes op. 74, you need the accompanying 2-CD set SCRIABIN: COMPLETE SONATAS, which consists of the 10 numbered piano sonatas, 2 posthumous piano sonatas, and opp. 65 and 71-4."
1,poor design,"I purchased this directly from catsplay.com. I am disappointed. This gym has a poor design. All the pieces are stacked directly over each other so there is no way for kitties to easily climb up and down. I had to put this next to another piece of furniture for them to get to the top. The middle condo is useless. It is too small for my large cats and is impossible for them to actually get into. The only positive comments I have are that it is made of solid wood and the cats do like the cradle on top. It worries me that they have to jump 5 feet down to get off it. I don't think the design is safe. Customer service from catsplay was poor. They did not update the shipping information when there was a delay. They will only communicate through email. My first email was not answered. When they did answer, it took a full 24 hours to hear from them. They did not provide a satisfactory resolution when I was unhappy with the product."
3,How long should you wait?,"If it were not for the fact that this item is part of an ongoing project and therefore I am in no real hurry I would find it some where else an not on amazon.com. I was supposed to receive it on the 28th of December now it's unknown. The bottom section came before Christmas. I be curious to see how Amazon.com handles this when the bill comes or are they not concerned about little old me. lolDon't get me wrong I do like Amazon.com, just not happy this time. Happy New Year!"
5,"Wonderful music, terrific sound quality","I got this a few years ago as part of a 3-disc box set and this is my favorite album out of the three. Excellent remastering work and nice Nashville production that's pure country, pure Chet. My favorites include ""Fiesta"", a perky album opener, ""Spanish Harlem"", and the excellent ""Django's Castle"". A must-have CD for your Chet collection."
2,Intresting but incomplete.,"I just got done watching this movie. I found it interesting to hear some of Jesus Christ teachings from various people (young and old, Christians and buddist). But I found some of their comments of Christ teachings to be completely wrong. Also the fact that they leave out the greatest thing Jesus Christ did, which is the Resurrection. They had a little 10 minute spot where some believe and some didn't believe. The author reminds me of a friend I had who said she believed in Jesus, but didn't believe in the Bible.If you are enjoy hearing other people thoughts on the Gospel, I say watch it. But don't look to it for any growth in your knowledge of Jesus Christ."
2,Should be on the $8.00 or less Rack,"I groom my dogs everday and they get their baths evry 2 weeks. I followed the directions and while I saw a little improvement in flea control and tick infestation I just switched to frontline as soon as my dogs were old enough. It smells good, and now I just use it in their bath water."
3,Better for humid climates,"I live in the desert southwest. I could not keep it moist enough, even with a plastic bag over it for humidity. Would've been great if I could've kept it moist enough, but as it was I only got a few handfuls of edible mushrooms. The others were all dry and gross. I would only reccommend this to someone who can give it high humidity."
2,Good start but no follow through,I am begining to suppect that Tapware's much harped on video chip is dead weight. No one seems to use it for video playback and only a hand full of games are out that use it. This thing has been out for like a year right. I think the ATI video chip may go the way of WiFi for TapWare... a non materializing possibility.....If you don't believe me check out the MMPlayer Forums where people are trying to use this thing.When you add it all up for Tapware this is what I get- Non upgradeable OS 5 and OS 6 will release soon- No WiFi still- No User replacable battery- No practicle support for ATI video chip- Full VGA screen on the way- 400 for the Z2 strikes me as way to highNO SALE for me
5,Neil Peart on a stripped down kit........Fantastic!,"This is a fantastic video showcasing some really great drumming by the likes of Omar Hakim and Will Calhoun (Living Colour). But the showstopper is Neil Peart performing Mexicali Rose and Cotton Tail. Of course it would not be complete without one of Neil's famous drum solo's. As expected, he delivers the goods. A must have for any Neil Peart fan!"
2,Just nothing,"First of all, this book goes so many times out of the main story that is difficult to remember it, the main story could be written in 50 pages or less, you won't take anything of this book, maybe two or three things about the animals Down Under but that is all. The story doesn't have any sense since the first page till the last one."
3,"Shirley's always good, but definitely not his best","I did enjoy this book, I would recommend it to be read, but in comparison with Shirley's other books, it's a bit lacking. It has the same wonderful characterization Shirley always shows, the right combination of drugs, sex, tense moments, and action that he always delivers, but I felt that the second half of the story was a bit rushed, the ending especially. If you just want a good, short read, then by all means, pick this book up, but if you're looking for one of Shirley's better works, I would recommend the Eclipse Trilogy or Demons."
3,Solid,"I enjoyed Cellars, but as someone looking to sample the ""splatterpunk"" genre, I found that it does not match Ketchum's Offseason or even most of the Michael Slade novels in terms of ""splatter""."
5,What a beautiful book.,"What a beautiful book... a wonderful story with gorgeous illustrations. We bought it at a yard sale and unfortunately the binding is starting to come apart (I have a 2 year old), so I will be buying a new copy from Amazon soon. My son and I both love this book!"
5,Secrets....,"With biblical examples and other examples of faith preachers who have gone on to be with the Lord, Hagin expresses that God desires to answer our prayers and how it is essential that we pray to the Father. This book is packed full of info in just a few pages. Hagin cites examples from Finney and Wigglesworth too in the book. Get this book, I finished it in under thirty minutes and will read it again and again in the years to come."
2,Not worthwhile for preparing for Jeopardy Audition,"I agree with David Martin who said that this book was not useful for a Jeopardy audition. I auditioned at the same time as Mr. Martin and I found more useful a book called Cultural Literacy Guide, even with its minor factual errors (the reviews of that book will point out the errors) In addition I would recommend watching Entertainment tonight or reading USA today for a while to catch up on your popculture info."
4,The Magnificent Magnetic Easel,"I bought this item for my 14 mo daughter for Christmas. She loves it! It plays music as she places the magnets on the easel. Her favorite part is once she has put all the magnets on the easel, she pulls the handle and watches them drop into the attached mesh basket. She giggles and begins again. The easel has two different scenes that you can place the magnets on besides an area with outlines of certain magnets for your child to match. The music is not annoying. It does have an area next to the play area that lights up. The easel is a good height for my daughter, she sits on the floor to play with it. This toy does have someroom to grow since you can also attach a regular size piece of paper to it. The easel could be place on a table top for an older child to play with it. The only thing that would make this toy even better would be if you could use any magnets not just the ones included. I've tried but they do not stick!"
4,Great toy,Both my 1 year old and 3 year old love the easel. They love the music and they think it's cool how you can pull the lever and all the magnets fall into the basket. My only wish was that it would be capable of holding other slightly bigger magnets that my 1 year old tries to put on it.
5,"Flamingos, How Much Fun","If you like flamingos this one will certainly charm you. It is finished on both sides pink splashed over white blended into silver with a white beak. It's stance, the cocked leg portrays a realistic image of the FLAMINGO! A unique and fun addition to your bracelet, enjoy, I am."
1,worst movie ever,"i wish i could give this movie zero star, but it doesn't exist-the most disastrous disaster movie of all times- the lowest budget movie and the dialogue, the characters,and the entire story line are ridiculous. Don't waste your time and money."
2,"Dorky and silly, with extra cheese","I like Patrick L. and he is the only reason to watch this besides the incredibly cheesy badness of it all. The rest of the actors are awful, special effects are mediocre at best, dialogue is awful, and the pilots' giddy voices are especially laughable in light of the glacier that is destroying millions as it moves."
1,Worst movie in history !,"This is the worst movie ever! Throw away your money, it'll be better spent that way.There's got to be a law against producing this kind of garbage."
1,"Even if there's nothing else to watch, don't bother with this stinker","We got through this stinker (yes, we watched ALL of it!) by pretending we were the guys from Mystery Science Theater 3000, making comments and filling in dialogue throughout. That made it a comedy. However, there are way too many inconsistencies, technical screw ups and just plain bad production, to even bother listing. The only positive experience from this entire 90 minutes of wasted time I'll never get back is that I realize I could easily make my own movies. I gave it one star because that's the lowest I could give. Otherwise it would be zero."
1,Worst Movie Ever?,"Quite possibly the worst movie ever, unbelievably bad, no redeeming quality unless you like terrible movies! So bad it's fun. Not really. It hurts."
3,priced way to high,"I watched this movie online,it,s pretty cool for a disaster but it,s not worth the price their asking Walmart has it on line for 5 bucks that,s about what it,s worth."
1,Not even remotely plausible!!,"I am a disaster movie junkie, so I rented this one in spite of the bad reviews. It really is that bad. Just for starters, glaciers do NOT roar along at 200 miles per hour. And nothing matches--people either freeze in their tracks or are running around in their shirt sleeves. The amount of time to drive from one place to another while outrunning a galloping 200 mph glacier never matches up. Save your time and your money!"
3,cute desert plate,These are cute but they are not really small enough and they don't really match the dishes.
3,OK,"Well, interesting. I wouldn't say it was the most captivating book, but it had an amazing story line. Hard to get into, and also noticed a few mistakes. 1) Chapter called Grand Daughter in the contents, called Grand Mother on the chapter page. 2)The editorial chapter's dates reverse, so either this is deliberate for some strange reason, or the proof readers stuffed it up.Anyway, send me any suggestions regarding the date stuff up."
4,operas need more information,"which are the ""finale"" of all this tancredi? the tragic of voltaire, or the happily version? please, explain more and better. (opera is not r'n'r' or pop music; and sorry for my poor english).luciano tanto, salta (argentina)."
4,For Your Information:,"TRACKS INCLUDE: SKY IS FALLING, FOREVER, WHEN ALL IS LOVE, FORGIVE ALL, IN EVIL BE INFANTS, SUB AWARENESS, BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM, SURROUND, SERATONIC, AND FOREVER (RADIO EDIT)."
1,Where is style ?,"I love Nathan Milstein. He plays very well italian music, and he wasn't italian.Troester are german and play with a poor sound and whithout sweetness, like fat germans loving beer."
1,Does not run on Mac OS X,"I bought this for my son because my older son has the I Spy and loves it. The I Spy runs perfect on Mac OS X. So I called Scholastic and they verified that it wouldn't run on anything later than OS 9. The error I get is ""You can't open the application I spy installer because the classic environment is no longer supported""So if you have a new Mac with leopard installed this won't work!"
1,Not a good product,The suction cup does not work at all. Speaker makes lots of extra noise and hands free option is the worst part of this device. This item has been manufactured very cheaply. I do not recommend this device at all.
3,6 volt remote,I did not purchase the American Hunter 6 volt remote for it's intended use with a feeder mechanism as designed. Rather I need a remote controller to turn a 6 volt moter driven device on and off. The American Hunter remote only runs for 5 second intervals before automatically turing off making it unsuitable for my intended purpose which requires the moter to run for periods much longer than 5 seconds.What I need is a 6 volt remote within the same price range as the American Hunter model that can be remotely turned on and remoteley turned off on cue. Can anyone help me locate a source?John A
4,Great Product,I got this cd for my husband and he was very happy with the product and the timely manner we received the cd.
5,OFF THE CHAIN,THIS ALBUM DIRTY THIRD 2 HOME SWEET HOME. IS A GREAT ALBUM.IT IS FULL OF SONGS OFF THE DIRTY 3RD 2 MOVIE!!!!!BUY IT MANN AM FOR REAL!!!!!!
3,Deluxe Tri-Ominos,Bought it for Grandkids. Don't know if they liked it or not. Will find out later whenever we see them again.
4,no problem -- liked -- nothing more to say,"As I have said this was a good product, no problems, nothing else to say! I resent being badgered about writing a review when I wanted the product. I have received calls at home and don't like it!"
5,Triominoes,"I ordered 3 of these, one for myself and two as gifts. The products are exactly as described and what I expected. The order arrived promptly and in good condition."
1,Boring,"After all the hype with Susan Boyle and her comments about Elaine Page, I expected something special, but I was disappointed. Instead of soaring vocals, her voice sounds like any run of the mill female pop star. That's especially true on ""Ave Maria"". A song that should be inspiring comes across as boring as she doesn't hit or hold the high notes. And the reason I bought this album, ""Thirty-two Feet and Eight Little Tails"", is only 51 seconds long and sounds like it was recorded by the Chipmunks. As I listened to each song, I waited for the energy to build, but it never did. I usually donate albums I don't want to a charity. I threw this one in the garbage."
4,Darn good for the price,"If you want to ditch the headphones for awhile, you can't go wrong with these. Sound quality is quite good and completely adequate - although if you are a 'persnickety' audiophile, don't expect miracles.My only caveat is this: the metal loop stand can too easily fold up on you and when you pick them up to move them, be careful not to put your thumb through the speaker cone.By the way, I use them for my iAudio X5 so they are not just for the iPods."
1,PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY,I ordered this item looking for small speakers to use at work for my Ipod. The speakers are TERRIBLE! If i could have given this a 0 star rating I would have!! The sound is distorted and I could barely hear the singers in each song! At times the left speaker would not even work. I am now returning them and can not wait to get them off my hands! I am 100% shocked that anyone in their right mind would give this a good rating! Are you people working for the company?!? PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY BETTER SPEAKERS!!! Thats what I am doing now!
3,ac yes! dc no!,"I love these speakers, loud and clear, and I got them used for $12BUTthat's with the ac adapter.Mine won't work on dc, they make a beeping noise both with batteries and with a car/cig adapter.Is it me or the unit"
3,Logitech mm22 Portable Speakers for iPod are decent,"These speakers have their good and bad qualities. The good: they are small & fold up conveniently to be carried easily. The bad: the sound is a little flatter & tinnier than the product description had led me to believe.Overall, they are a decent way for me to listen to my iPod when I'm not somewhere with a full-blown stereo."
1,It sucks,The title gives it away it suck flat out. I did not like it at all. spend the extra $ and get better ones.
2,FAIR When They Actually Work,"I went to the store trying to find some ipod speakers that wouldn't cost me more than 100 bucks. i saw these and thought that theyd be ok, and they sold for a good price of only 60 bucks. i brought em home and used em off and on for about a week. they were always giving off very good sound quality, but the cradle did a horrible job of holding up the ipod and the speakers kept falling down. i kept it though, i just avoided using the cradle. about a week after i started using em, one speaker completely stopped playing music. i was really annoyed buy it and decided to take it back. i looked around and found a much better speaker system, the Logic-3 iStation, although it cost me double the price. however, i am very happy with the iStation, and i don't know what happened to logitech here because i usually am very happy with their products."
4,Good but not Great,"This is a good overall product. There is actually only one flaw, which was that the iPod cannot be charged when in the cradle. Other than that it is fine."
2,NOT the Rosamunde Pilcher book!!,"Amazon listed this DVD along with several others made from novels by one of my favorite authors-Rosamunde Pilcher. She did write a book called ""Winter Solstice:, but this is not it. Just a heads up--I don't think they should list it with other Pilcher DVDs."
1,Shallow and Awkward,"I should really learn to never judge a book (or movie) by its cover. The laurels this film got from critics as well as film festivals just shows how out of touch they really are. This has got to be the worst movie I've seen since ""About Schmitdt"". The plot was thin, the characters were never really developed, and the direction was poor. Too bad, in the hands of the right director it could have been quite good."
1,Winter Solstice,"Unfortunately, I did not read what this movie was about and thought I was ordering a movie based on Rosamunde Pilcher's book by the same name. It not only was not that movie but it was not a very entertaining movie. Very dull and depressing with only one scene that made me laugh. I thought that it was a waste of good acting talent."
5,"hooked;PIRATES,POACHING, AND THE PERFECT FISH",BUYING WAS EASY AND DELIVERY WAS QUICK. WHATELSE CAN A CUSTOMER ASK FOR?
4,Fun toy,My son loved this crane and plays with it every day. I was impressed at how well it is built and even has a metal hook.
5,My boys adore these cranes,"Santa brought them each one for Christmas, and while they are only 3.5 years old, they have no problem using them. They can be rough, but these cranes are holding up just fine. All the little details are amazing, and they really are great trucks."
3,I enjoyed reading Contempt of Court,"I enjoyed reading Contempt of Court despite feeling as though it was written for a 10th grade audience. The topic was a wonderful choice and the book appears to be very well researched.The authors mix fiction (e.g. details of the characters feelings and thoughts) with facts in a easy-to-read, story-telling format. The frequent use of quotes from newspaper articles and editorials suggest that the authors relied heavily on these accounts. The book is very biased for Ed Johnson and his lawyers - a fact that does not detract from the tale.I recommend this book to all students of American civil liberties and I thank Curriden and Phillips for shining a light on this enthralling moment in our history."
4,GOOD! But not perfect!,"Just re-read this book. I really enjoyed it both times, especialy since many of the main characters are boatswain mates and deck crew. As a retired BM1 from the USNR I could relate quite well to them and their feelings. My only complaint is Mr. McFadden has several technical errors. Maybe his Army NG knowledge overwhelmed his 4 years of USN knowledge or he just didn't do enough careful research. The main one being the Kimmel's helo which he called a seasprite but designated a ch-60. The Navy flys sh-60 seahawks off destroyers and other similar ships. The seasprite was a sh-2f or 2g and few if any were still in service when this story took place. I could nitpick a few other things but the story and most of the info was right on. I'm still waiting on the sequel but as 10 years have lapsed, I'm probably going to be disappointed."
5,Hilarious,Reading So Me was like watching Graham on television. Hilarious from start to finish. I found myself constantly laughing out loud whilst reading this on holidays. A great holiday read.
2,"A disappointing ""Oracle""","I have the entire collection of Paul Auster's works, and therefore would classify myself as a fan of his. This book, however, was a grave disappointment, which I found barely readable. It appears as if Auster wrote this novel, ""Oracle Night"", and found that it was too short in content. Then, to resolve the problem, he re-wrote it adding the new text as footnotes, filling in the blanks. A large percentage of this book is footnotes, comprised of smaller text, which is difficult to read and continually disturbs the pace of the story while taxing these poor senior eyes to their maximum degree. Paul Auster, cut to the chase and stop with the gimmicks. No more bold text, no more footnotes, simply tell the story in the excellent style you have developed over so many years. You will find me a gracious and appreciative reader, continuing to be one of your sincere and avid fans."
2,Promising Start Leads to Disappointment,"In ""Oracle Night"" Auster tempts the reader with many intriguing subplots, only to leave each of them at a dead end, never developing them to completion. Overall, it felt like a waste of time- it was the portrayal of a marriage full of deceit and adultery, which Auster tries to pawn off as acceptable since the protaganist, Sydney Orr, writes about it first in his mysterious blue notebook. While the reader wants to sympathise with the protaganist, it's simply impossible. By the end of the story feelings towards Orr border on disgust, and his theory that the words we write dictate our futures leaves a foul aftertaste.What could have been an intruiging tale wound up a confusion of underdeveloped subplots- and not worth the time it takes to pull the true story from the muddle."
2,You can't be serious!,"Hey, I know Paul Auster has been...in the past...an extraordinary writer. But this book is sloppy to the point of insulting. Lots of tantalizing leads (hence the 2 stars), but absolutely no intelligent follow-up. And he doesn't even bother to TRY making the plot lines cohere. He simply lets them drop from sight. And the whole ""climax"" with Grace and Trause's 2-dimensional son? What inspired that bit of B-grade TV melodrama? Mr Auster is apparently not very concerned about delivering to his readers, folks. Very sad, really."
4,"Not their best, but definitely a good one","The Dead do not make their best showing here, since some of the songs were somewhat slow at times, especially the thoroughly disappointing ""Friend of the Devil"", which was a song I was looking forward to when I bought it, but I was a bit let down by it overall. However, I am giving the wrong impression here. This is a good album, and it is twice as good if you are a Deadhead, or even a fan of the Dead. Also, I will tell you now that this CD boasts the best version of ""Sugar Magnolia"" that you will find on any of their CDs, hands down. So, overall, I would say that this is worth at least a look, and you will probably not be disappointed."
1,Anemic,"Dull, uninspired performance of a good set list. The people with the Dark Star banner should have kept counting, since this rendition was so lame. Aside from a few efforts by Weir, there's a sustained lack of passion throughout the show. Sadly, Garcia must have been burned out.This performance doesn't hold a candle to any of their live CDs from prior to the mid-70s."
4,Good love story,"If you like mini-series, you will really like this one. It keeps your interest and has good acting. I liked it alot."
5,WONDERFUL KIDS BOOK,GREAT BOOK FOR CHILDREN AND FOR ANYONE WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES ALOT OF FUN AND GREAT GRAPHICS HIGHLY RECCOMEND FOR PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN
3,Brush Bristles in the paint,"I'm going to be extra picky about this product because I'm an Art Teacher as well as a mom. I truly believe that kiddos deserve to use quality art supplies, no matter what age. These brushes are fine for toddlers, but be warned that the natural bristles do fall out often and get stuck to the paint/paper. I LOVE Melissa and Doug brand products, but if you're looking for brushes to go with their paint cups, my advice is to splurge a wee bit on some slightly softer, synthetic bristle brushes from another company."
4,An Eye-Opening Perspective,"I've read many books about the Civil War and several about the Battle of Gettysburg, but I've never read one from the perspective of the women/non-combatants. It was chilling to watch them caught up into the maelstrom of battle as they were living their ordinary lives--planning a 4th of July picnic, squabbling with their families, trying to manage their farm. Without warning or preparation, these women were thrust into the role of nurse, hospital orderly, cook, undertaker while the cannons roared in their front yards and their floors, beds and furniture were soaked in blood. I'll never see Gettysburg quite the same again.My only criticism is that the transitions from one character to another were very abrupt--at least in the kindle edition. I had to back up several times to figure out what was happening.Other than that, an important and fascinating story."
5,Bravo!,"I cannot add much to what has already been written. Suffice to say, you can not go wrong with purchasing this lovely series. Regardless of age or background, you will find a touchstone or two for your own life.As for the acting, well, no words can describe the pure magic of witnessing the chemistry between Geoffrey Palmer and Judi Dench. They are two of the finest actors any generation could produce. The supporting cast is very strong, even though some of the characters might have to grow on you. Then again, the same could be said for many people in our own lives.Enjoy."
5,Dr. Clarence Taylor and Dr. Birnbaum gathered excellent information.,"If you really want to know what the Civil Rights Movement accomplished, you should read this novel that has annotations and reference pages. The book quotes Reconstruction and Civil Rights experts.The book details how blacks were able to manage schools,the limit and broadness of the tobacco trade, the labor movement and how the African-American struggle assisted this movement.The book gives statistics that purport the glass ceiling. It is an informative text that should be read by people who want to appreciate and comprehend the history of struggles for equality."
3,i haven't read this book but.......,"this guy is my professor this semester, i figured a little sucking up wouldn't hurt. on a more serious note, i have to admit that mr. taylor (smart-ass comments aside) is fully versed on a number of historical themes, it is truly admirable. he seems to be a strict individual but not to the point of being unyielding. i trust that his book will be an engaging read."
4,"Good, but Poses Better","For a first major album this one is pretty good, but save your money buy the non-import... The ""one"" bonus track is not worth the extra $$ unless you're a major fan.I like to have an album I can listen to over and over again. Buy Poses or Want One/Two."
5,For Those Wanting Some Additional Information on the UPC,"If this book has sparked an interest in the United Pentecostal Church, you may be interested in checking out a web site which in part addresses some matters in the UPC. http://www.spiritualabuse.orgThere is also a small section on history there, with a little information about this book by Thomas Fudge.This book may be one of the best documented books dealing with the UPC, with a great many footnotes to back up what is shared. This is not the first historical book Fudge has written. He doesn't simply make statements and leave people wondering if the infomation was taken out of thin air. It is interesting to note that the UPC appeared to have tried to hinder his research. There are things in this book which the average UPC member/attender may not know."
1,LIES,"Don't waste your time or money. As a member of a UPC, for over 20 years, I can tell you that this book DOES NOT, represent the way the UPC really operates. We are thankful for our past and looking forward to the future. If you really want a good book, try reading the Bible."
1,Lots of pretty pictures,"This book is great if you're looking for some hints on mixing and matching your wardrobe. There is very little text in the book, it consists mostly of pictures of clothing in different colors. This is not a book to read, simply one to look at."
4,Project N- Waiting for the stars to fall into place,Being from Seattle we are all a little alternatived out BUT! this cd's samples will WOW you with lyrics and the music is more mellow. Perfect for a drive along the coast or background to a party. Singer's voice is mmmmm good. I could understand the words! I'm buying it for those people who say alt rock is trash. This one is a keeper for the long haul. You'll listen over and over for years. Very dollar wise.
4,Good for the price,"It's a good basic kit. Charger is fine; it does its job (5/5). The case is ok; it protects the phone well (4/5). The earpiece is so-so; the sound could be a little better, but for the price, it's adequate (3/5)."
2,Definitely for beginners only!,"With its large fonts and large spacing between lines, this book looks more for students who need an introduction to MPEG and JPEG. Nothing useful in here. Everything could be found on the web for free! Considering its price, this book is a very big and not to say expensive disappointment."
4,nice unit,"the set up cd was very easy to use. we did have some problems with the usb adapter. we found out that the port on the second computer was loose, once we corrected that problem the system runs good."
3,Not fairly balanced,Great biography but if studying the life of Nixon one will need more research material.The video is not really fairly balanced and is a bit more negative then it has to be.Too much is placed on Watergate and not enough on the positives of his work.
3,smaller then described,granted I had a specific space under the stairs I wanted to fit so the dimensions were important but the bed was not a filled out 5 x 36 x 24 but 2 inches smaller in each dimension. It looked well made but I had to return it because it just wasn't the right size for my needs.
4,"A bit large, but lots of pockets","It's a bit thick overall, but it has a ton of pockets. For some of my gear, the pockets are a bit tight, but perhaps I'm asking too much. I want a thin case with thick storage. I need something bigger on the inside than it is on the outside like a TARDIS, but I suspect I'm unlikely to find that in the real world. But, it's pretty thin, holds lots of stuff and provides good protection for my laptop. I suspect that's all I could ask for."
5,Great buy,Its realy great laptop bag. A lot of space for all staff what are you need with your laptop.
1,Clasp Broken,I recently purchased this item as a gift for Christmas. When I received the chain the clasp was broken. I e-mailed this company two times regarding their return policy. I have yet to hear back from the company. I am VERY disappointed in my purchase AND this particular company.
1,Broken Clasp,"The chain looked great when I received it. However, the problem I had is the Lobster Claw Clasp broke after a couple of weeks wearing it. I would not recommend this chain for someone wanting it for everyday wear."
2,Too Small for flowers,"This is a delicate, etched,light crystal vase about 2"" tall! The brim is wide so you cannot use it for a bud vase. It is very pretty but useless. I had to return it because I can't figure out a way to utilize the vase. Think again before buying."
1,Wrong product!,"I had the same experience. The picture & listing clearly state you are ordering the nite white turbo and so does my order as well as the cost, and I received the nite while excel. :( I have contacted the seller in hopes they will correct this for me asap."
5,Classic D&B must have!,This album is a must have for your D&B collection! I just wish Adam F would come out with some new tracks =)
3,decent charger,"pros: has red (not charging), yellow (charging), green (charged) light that is fairly big and easy to see.cons: the coiled cord makes placing your ipod, say on your car seat, anything over 1 foot away difficult. you need to strategically place the ipod near the car charger outlet."
2,"Looks like a great value, but....","I've had the Dimage 2300 a few months now and up until the present moment it's been a solid camera. Pretty decent image quality and good performance, considering the price.All of a sudden it started bugging out. Specifically, it would blink the low battery signal after just having bought batteries. I'd try putting the camera in PC mode so I could upload all the pictures to my PC and I'd get an error on my computer saying that ""The camera could not be located properly."" Not only that but the camera would blink low battery again. Very frustrating; at this point I'm thinking I just threw 400 bucks out the window.I don't know if the internal processor is cheaply designed or what, but I can say that there certainly is a reason for this camera being as cheap a price as it is. Take heed."
4,Awesome book!,"I loved this story. The characters had great chemistry, and the bit of mystery thrown in kept me guessing right up until the end. Every time I thought I had something figured out, the author surprised me. This book read slightly like a formulaic romance in parts, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. But certain things, like the apple tree legend, and the witty dialogue in some parts stood out as anything but formulaic.I highly recommend this book, especially if you're a lover of contemporary romances."
2,Nice reading but...,The book was a nice read but it seemed to be quite repetitive. It could have been rapped up much sooner then it was.
1,disappointed,"I picked this book up based upon the reviews I read. Those who gave this book great reviews obviously need to widen their repertoire of reading material. I did get through the book in 3 days, mostly due to the fact that I kept holding out hope that I would eventually fall in love with it. I did like how the author develop her characters, but the plot was week and for lack of better words the ending was cheesy and cheap. Sorry if that is harsh."
4,Good feeling and happy ending book,Very touching and. Pull on the heart strings book. The characters were true to their feelings and were like real people.
2,Disappointed,This is the first book of Barbara Freethy that I have read. I was disappointed with the use of profanity in the book. It did not enhance the story in the least but cheapened the characters. the second thing was the immorality. A love story can be beautiful and uplifting without the use of these two items. Thank you for letting me express my opinion.
1,BAIT AND SWITCH!!,"Purchased Qty 2 of C2G / Cables to Go 10221 External Serial ATA Cable (2 Meters, Black)from (Sold by: BOQOPO) and they did the old bait and switch.I was very specific in what I was ordering.What I rec'd was a RED generic cable Mfg'ed by KEEN TOP out of Hong Kong.Took over two weeks to get them and not happy when I opened the package only to find a knock off cable.RETURNING FOR REFUND!C2G / Cables to Go 10221 External Serial ATA Cable (2 Meters, Black)"
4,"Great Pictures, not much on information.","If you are looking for a book with wonderful pictures, than this book just might be for you. Though the information regarding each species of fish is rather weak, it still makes for a great book. I still enjoy spending hours looking through it even though I've owned it for for a few months!"
4,"Low Price, Works Well","Added to an Antec 300 case. Of course it leaves no space for an optical drive, but I was building a media server. Tight fit.Pros: Looks great on the Antec 300 with Antec LED fansCan't beat the price.Cons: Need to remove cage to add drive"
4,Amazing! But needs the 'final' touch...,"The product functionality couldn't be any better, hard discs are working in hard discs' heaven now! The fan is silent, but when I put my hand in front of it I feel it's vacuuming air into the case!!The reasons I gave it 4 stars:1- The aluminum is great but there are some sharp edges here and there. Not the whole product, but in some areas especially around the fan.2- Tt could have completed the package by throwing in a removable dust cover on the fan. I have an Armor+ case that comes with built-in dust covers behind the 5.25 bays which does the job as the iCage is mounted exactly behind them, but they should have considered that not everyone have their cases and should have complimented the iCage with the dust cover."
3,Facts of Life--the early years,"I have to say that watching the 1st season was a little painful--I'm not sure what happened with the casting but a couple of the actresses really couldn't act at all. It was kind of like watching the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders when they were on The Love Boat--cute but that's about it. The writing had a lot to be desired of, too, but got a little better as the season progressed. Thank goodness the choices on who moved on to the 2nd and beyond seasons was correct with Blair, Tootie, Natalie and later, Jo. Definitely easier to watch! Love the nostalgia of the 80's--can't wait for the next season to come out!"
3,I don't reccomend this at all :(,"There's more than one problem with the first season of ""the facts of life"". There's a little language. But I think the worst thing about it is the constant talk about sex. They mention sex in every episode! It gets annoying. And the acting is bad. it kind of funny, but you can watch a much cleaner show and get ""funny"". For example, Full House. Full house is definitly cleaner than ""the facts of life"" and more interesting too. And it's a bit funny. It isn't the cleanest show around, but cleaner than the facts of life. Although the earlier seasons aren't clean, the later ones are cleaner. So instead of being bored on a saturday night watching the ""facts of life"", I reccomend season 6 or 7 of Full house."
2,confused,"You have pedals that in picture are stick and you say you have them for auto. How are you suppose to order, there's no different order number,,duh"
1,RIO DOLT SP50,"This either is a defect or all reviewers prior are not keen to detail. My unit won't play ANY MP3's on CD-RW at all! Plays cds fine though. Not why i purchased this POS in the first place. In the FAQ's they mention if you burn with Adaptec Software and the disk is formatted with Direct CD not to use disc compression. It didnt matter either way as the disk is never read by the player ""NOCDMP3"" was the message I recieved on over 15 different CD-RW's I have loaded with Mp3's. I sent in the rebate before I found out if the Mp3 feature worked.. Hope I can still get a refund..."
2,As long as you don't want to play MP3s,"We bought one of these that had been refurbished. It looked to be in perfect condition, and it's just fine at playing ordinary CDs. I have yet, however, to be able to make an MP3 that it recognizes. It just says ""NOCDMP3."" The software I am using is the Macintosh iTunes3; it works perfectly with Riovolt's SP90 player. I'm glad this one was VERY cheap. If it had read MP3s, though, I'd be perfectly happy."
4,Good Value for the Price,"When I first bought this player, I though for certainI was going to return it. Whenever the shock protectionwas turned on, CDs would have blips in them; the buttonswere totally confusing and oriented in such a way thatwhenever you put the player in a backpack or carrying case,they would get pushed and the player would turn off or switch tracks.Well, the blipping noise went away after a few hours ofplay (even with the exact same CDs and batteries!) andI found a ""lock"" switch to disable the buttons so I canthrow it in my backpack while it is playing.It still doesn't play scratched disks very well, and iteats batteries, but everything else is fine consideringthe price--around $[money]. Plan to read the instructionmanual at least three times if you want to play MP3disks. The text screen is very cool, but the buttonsare still pretty arcane."
3,Lane not up to the par of Elements of A Kill,"Police officer of the north, Ray Attla makes his second appearence in Season of Death. This time he is away from the high crime of the Yukon and on a journey with his friends into the Alaskan wilderness.With the help of a dopey guide Attla and two friends set out into the wilderness. Once there occurances of mistakes leaves the three short on supplies and low moral. Then they come across a skull with a bullet hole in it. After they visit an archaeological dig Attla suspect that the skull is not from the past but is a recent murder vicitim.From that point on the reader is pulled into a game of cat and mouse with Attla and a loco local."
5,Best game in the world,This game is the best game in the world first i had nba inside drive 2002 and i thought that was great this is a million times better
1,very dissapointed,"i recently bought this game..got home played it and was very disapointed..the game play is horrible..its very slow and sluggish..i guess im use to nba live 03 and its great controls.. i was very pleased to see you could actually creat-a-player and use him in your franchise, which is the only drawback from nba live 03..plus unless you loved the camera angles from double dribble on nintendo from the early 80's,(yes im old school)then you'll hate these..the only reason i gave it a one star is for the create-a-player in franchise option..other wise i would have given it 0 its that bad"
1,The Jewish Roots of Christianity,"CAUTION - PURCHASE THIS BOOK ONLY IF YOU UNDERSTAND SPANISH. Even though it is advertised in English with an English title, you will receive a book entitled ""Las raices judias del Cristianismo"""
3,Used to really like this stroller,"My husband and I bought this stroller because as our son got older we found that our travel system was to heavy and bulky to carry around. We wanted a nice umbrella stroller for everyday use. At first we were happy with this stroller. It is compact, lightweight, and easy to maneuver. My problem was with the straps. I made them as tight as possible and my son could wiggle around quite a bit. This didn't bother me at first (when my son was younger and not as mobile) but then I realized that he was sticking his arms through the straps and trying to get himself out of the stroller. The straps could not be tightened any more than they already were and I was worried that he was going to try and get out of the stroller it flip it over. This is an okay stroller but from a safety standpoint I was concerned. In the end, we retuned it and bought the Peg Perego Aria."
5,Great therapy book,"One of my undergraduate professors introduced me to this book. It is a WONDERFUL resource not only for diagnosing fluency disorders, but also for therapy. Daly gives you a great buy for your money."
4,Selling for Smarties!,Tom has done it again with this tool. He has made a great product for the new salesperson or a refresher for us old guys!
5,"Informative, well researched and easy to read","This book is really one of a kind; most birth books don't talk about the grandparents' role. It offers lots of helpful advice, like how to help your daughter through her pregnancy, what foods to offer when she comes to visit, and how to prepare for attending the birth -- it even has a checklist of items to take with you to the hospital. It describes the different ways you can help in the delivery room, whether you want to be just there for moral support or want a more active role. In addition, the book has chapters about child-proofing your house for grandchildren, a history of childbirthing practices, and a plain English description of new obstetric technology -- it even has a sensitive chapter about stillbirth, which most birth books ignore. I found this book really helpful and recommend it to all grandparents, even those who aren't really interested in attending the birth -- there is plenty of other information you can use."
2,Not for natural child birth!,"I needed a book that would explain to my mother the ways of natural childbirth. I have a doula and receive care from a midwife. This was written by a Dr. and covered what to expect when you go the extreme medical route. It was so far from what I wanted my mother to gain from her experience and know going into it that I didn't even give her the book. It had some good advice, but not nearly enough to justify asking my mom to read the whole thing. I would recommend ""The Doula Guide to Birth"". A much more informative book, and funny enough, it's where I learned about this book for grandparents. I would suggest that if you do ask the grandparents to read any birthing book, that you read it first. I'm glad I did."
2,Corny attempt to cash in on the Death Note franchise.,"The story was pretty bad. It's clear upon watching it that this third movie is an attempt to further cash in on Death Note by introducing a ""side story"" that has nothing to do with the Manga, or the first two live action movies. There is no use of the titular ""Death Note"", no clever cat-and-mouse moments, the motives of the villains are incredibly one dimensional, and they don't really bring the type of rivalry seen in the previous movies. The only thing that saved this movie from a 2 star review was the character L. So unless you're a fan of L, I wouldn't recommend this movie for you."
1,Very Obviously Bootleg,"This is obviously bootleg so I gave it 1 star. Even if it were not bootleg I would only give it 2 or 3 stars max. I think they did as best a job as they could keeping L true to character in the death note movies...but thats not saying much. Due to time constraints they could only tell so much of the story so L is just sort of ""eh, passable"". Now I'm saying this because if L is only ""eh, passable"" in the movies based directly off death note than what the hell is he going to be in a spin off like this?!?!?! L was completely out of character (if you're judging from the original manga) and I only watched it because I'm an L fangirl. Really though I think this movie makes a mockery of L's original character."
3,Not extraordinary,"Unlike the first set, this second set of videos does not astound. My bias is for larger fish and mammals of the sea. The deep sea footage of ""The Deep"" was amazing in the breadth of the variety of organisms shown. The majority of the footage for the fourth DVD involves land animals, birds and invertebrates. The third DVD has some interesting scenes of sharks hunting at night but it didn't feel like it had any image that topped the first two DVDs. Buy these if you want a complete set at home but they're not absolutely necessary."
3,The game display was dark,this game was very dark to watch. I could barely see it on the the screen of the TV. Didn't use it too much.
4,"ODD, yes, but amazingly good!","Blinx is an amazing game all the way around. It is the weirdest game I have player yet, but that is what makes it sooooo fun!Here is the lowdown...Graphics: 4-D! Great graphics! The worlds are really cool, and everything about the graphics are cool!Gameplay: VERY ODD! This is the first game where you can pause, fast forward, rewind, etc. and this is what makes the game so much fun! You have to use strategy to beat this game. You can't just be good at video games to beat this game... you have to have a brain.Fun Factor: Very fun! The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is because it can get a little aggravating when you can't get pass that certain level or you don't have an item you need, so you have to die.Pros-VERY FUN!-GRAPHICS (4-D)-Lots of levelsCons-1 hit your dead-short levels-oddOverall a great game! Depending on what you think by this review, this could be a must buy or a rent!"
2,Vacuums?,"Graphics 10/10: This is Xbox of course it's going to get good graphics. It does have a wierd camera system at some points but you get used to it.Gameplay 6/10: This game is definetly original i'll give it that much, but it does get really boring after a while. The thing that really is annoying about this game is that you only get 10:00 to beat every level. Also you have to find ""ammo"" (better known as garbage) throughout every level.Sound 0/10: This sound is so annoying that I have actually gotten killed by getting annoyed at the sound and not paying attention.Replay Value 2/10: You can go back through the levels to get the medals but it gets boring really fast.Overall Score 4.5/10: If I were you don't get this game. It is for little kids mainly but some teenagers will like this game for a while."
1,this game suxws,this game is ok at first then it suxs after a while because it gets tooooo hard to beat the levels. Also each level is basically the same because it has the same monsterss in it just more of them.
2,disappointing,"Biskind misses the mark this time. He seemed to focus on 3 trees (the Weinsteins and Redford) and miss the whole forest (the rise and eventual fall by co-opting, commercialization and neglect of indie film in the nineties). As others have said, I wanted both more and less. The book is painfully sloppy at times and cries out for an editor. Going from silent film to Blair Witch, Merritt's ""Celluloid Mavericks"" remains the best book on the wide history of American indie film."
2,"Interesting at first, then gets repetitive and boring","Mr Biskind's previous book, ""Easy Riders, Raging Bulls"" was far better, simply because the people he wrote about (directors like Friedkin, Scorsese, Altman, etc.) were more interesting people and filmmakers. I never had the feeling that the author really cared about the movies he was writing about. This book is really about Miramax and Harvey Weinstein and once you've understood that Harvey Weinstein is a savvy producer but also a monster prone to uncontrollable fits of rage, you've understood 70% of the book's content. There are some interesting passages, mainly about Tarantino and Soderbergh, but the same story could have been told in a much shorter form. I often had the impression that the publisher badly wanted a 400 pages book, even if 250 pages would have been more than enough."
4,Good Game,"This game is great! But to me, it needs some work on the graphics. Otherwise, you should get this game."
2,Well it's got a great cover,"I imagine that had I read this book when I was younger, it would have been a fine addition to the canon of mind-blowing science fiction books. I also think that if I had read this book in 1971, it would have been very prescient.However, read it as an adult, I can't ignore certain things that kill science fiction books for me. First, the culture is mired in the 1960s with that rampant paranoia about how these countries will all become empires that kill people for speaking out. The second part is the general flatness of the characters. The woman is there to be hot and independent but not much else is going on with her.Finally, the book pulls the ""characters talk about the science stuff"" trick for about 10 pages and by the end of it, I just don't care anymore. The science is interesting but the characters are too flat for my taste.That's not to say that I hate potboilers but they have to have more qualities than what most are offering."
4,So much fun,"If you constantly find yourself needing to blow out some candles from across the room but really don't to stand up walk over there, and blow with your own lungs, then this is the product for you!!!This is an absolute blast! I received one for my birthday (my 20th birthday HA!) and my friends loved it so much that I bought 2 more for them.With practice they can shoot up to around 30-40 ft!My original one, however, broke a few months ago but with a little tape, it was as good as new."
2,Major Assembly Frustration,"Assembly of the Airzooka is a major hassle and can be seriously frustrating. Poor product design.From the instructions one can surmise that the user will make the cone out of the three rings by use of a screw thread. The problem is that the thread is on the inside (not visible) and there are two sets of threads (one for each ring intersection) but only one place to hold on - this makes the system difficult to manipulate and impossible to visualize.If you go ""off-plan"" in the first steps of the instructions it is next to impossible to get back to the starting point: you are on your own to twist and pull, rotate backwards and push. My experience was that the device did not ""click"" as it should have and the rings got cross-threaded - I then spent the rest of the afternoon jamming it and pulling it until I had something that seemed solid and aligned (a big risk for $18)"
3,Fun but watch the tabs.,"This was a fun purchase I use in our nursery school. After some use the tabs holding the telescoping sections broke off, and I was able to retrofit screws to hold the airzooka together. Still a lot of fun."
5,Office Toy!,"Who knew a battle would break out today? Just got this thing last night and brought it in and my department broke out in a battle. So I pulled out the Airzooka and blew 'em all away! Ha! They loved it. My cube buddy even shot the big boss with it as he wandered into the aftermath. Best of all, while everyone else was collecting their spent ammo, we were back at our desks with no clean-up. Could have spent the same or more on a pop gun with limited ammo and just as limited lifespan as this thing is reported to have. This is just as fun and less work. Safer, too! No threat of hitting someone in the eye with a projectile or plopping a foreign object into a cup. I'm getting another one!"
5,Great Gift,This was a great gift. The air really packs a nice blast from across a large room. Not sure how long the bag will hold up but it hasn't broken yet. Kinda tricky to put together.
1,not worth the assembly hassle,I bought one of these several years ago and had no problem assembling it.This time the parts would not align properly and one of the handle attachment tabs broke off. By the time I had it together I was too weak to pull back the rubber band that powers the thing.Forget about it.
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could,"I ordered this for my little brother and I (he's 18, I'm 24) to launch a stealth attack on my dad, becuase why else would you have kids if you didn't intend for them to annoy you well into your fifties? What a huge disappointment. The set-up was pretty simple, but it's way bigger than I expected. The barrel part of it is the size of a trashcan. But the very disappointing aspect was it's performance. I can see how kids would enjoy this, because it makes a very loud sound when ""launched."" However the wind produced is about the equivalent of having someone blow as hard as they can on you from about a foot away. Enough air blows to ruffle your blouse, but not nearly enough to startle anyone. If they are startled (or annoyed), it is definitely because of the noise. Overally, I think that this is a very shoddy product (I promptly returned mine), and I would not recommend it to anyone who is beyond the age of being amused by loud popping noises."
1,Piece of junk,As this is a G rated website I'll not call this the POS that it is. It took 3 of us 30 minutes to assemble and you can make more noise popping paper bags. It's being returned.
3,Many faults but still fun!,"I got this so I can blast kids in the classroom for fun or let them blast me if I make a mistake, etc...something to ease the middle school classroom tension. That said, it is kind of difficult to assemble, does not actually have a trigger, is pretty hard to aim, is HUGE in size, and the shooting involves pulling back some super heavy duty plastic material at a tension that is too difficult for any kid under the age of 8. One piece came unsnapped after about 30 in-house firings but with a little coaxing I got it snapped back in place. Regardless of all that it is still way cool and hope to have lots of fun with it in class!!"
3,Fast shipping. Product was a little sketchy though.,"I did receive my product quickly, and in fine packaging. However, within 20 minutes of using this product, the collar that holds the plastic bag down popped off and would not stay on due to the fact that the tabs were too small. It took four screws, 15 minutes, and a drill to fix."
3,Kool Toy,BUT too loud for the surprise air blast..if it was not so loud it would be really KOOL..still fun with the cat..
4,Well Made,"Well made products, however, I have found putting vaseline on the legs of the feeders solves most of the coon problem without the need for the cage."
5,Pefect for your cat.,"I have two of this one was for my niece's cat. I know there is no handle but trust it does the job quite well. I usually used it in my cat before given it a bath and after. Also the item is pretty cheap, so you won't feel like your breaking your piggy bank."
3,Rotary tray problems,"I don't have any experience with other slide projectors with which to compare quality, ease of use or reliability. The slides in the Rotary tray are - by design - difficult to locate to edit. I have had no difficulty operating with the Rotary Trays except when a slide has previously been damaged."
3,Nice Puzzles -- But Are They Practical?,"Fred Reinfeld's ""1001 Checkmates"" gives hundreds of positions which are apparently drawn from actual game situations, and the student who applies himself to the book can take away practical knowledge that will help in actual play. The positions in ""202 Surprising Checkmates"" could never be mistaken for actual game situations, and the mating patterns are not normally seen in actual play. Although the book appears to have little practical value, the problems were both challenging and entertaining.If you like this volume, you might want to ""check"" out ""303 Tricky Checkmates"" by the same authors."
1,4 Stars Now - Problem Fixed - I just got one and the board is bad!,I ordered my TV before the board issues were posted. I just got it 2 days ago and after 10 minutes the picture disappears and is replaced with color patterns. Presume this is the issue that's being discussed! Samsung said I'd need on-site service but the service company can not come for 2 weeks! I'm not happy waiting 2 weeks. Should I exchange this and hope I get a newer version without this board problem or just hold tight for the 2 weeks and get it fixed? Does anyone have any experience with this or advise for me?Thanks! Deb Gamba
1,Too many repair issues,"I bought this TV back in 2008. Right out of the box, the HDMI would not work so I took the TV in for repair. The HDMI worked but I have always had issues with the various inputs. For whatever reason, sometimes the TV sees a device and other times it does not. I attempted to install the latest Firmware on the TV and the picture was distorted after I installed the Firmeware. I asked if I could revert back to the first Firmware and you cannot. Samsung gave me the name of an authorized dealer for repair that is 35 minutes from my house. I live in SE so it is not like I live in the sticks. Add to all of the hassle that the TV is no longer under warranty so now I get to pay to get the TV fixed. Hopefully, the dealer does not kill me on the cost. No more Samsung for this consumer."
1,Planned Obsolescence,"I bought this just when it came out and the TV was pretty good while it was under its warranty. There were some issues with the sound where the speakers muffled and the volume on different channels would sometimes be astoundingly higher than others. But none of that really bothered me too much, if you want a nice HDTV you should probably pony up for surround sound anyways. The thing that really irks me is the cheap capacitors that Samsung used, which all blew out one month after the warranty expired. Now when I try to turn the TV on, it clicks for a few minutes with the red light blinking and when it finally powers on, I get a picture filled with blue and purple pixels. This is the same issue that has been documented by thousands of other owners of this TV online. Just do a quick Google search."
3,Started to fail after 15 months,"I got a great deal here on Amazon buying this tv in March 2008. They beat Best Buy, Circuit City and Frys on the price. No sales tax and free delivery.However, after 15 months (3 months out of warranty) it started having issues turning on (it would make clicking noises for up to 10 minutes before it would turn on). After some internet sleuthing, my husband ended up replacing some cheap parts. After a trip to Radio Shack and digging out his trusty soldering iron, I think it cost us $15 (that included his lunch at Del Taco).But the issue remains: $1100 tvs should last longer than 15 months. It makes me question purchasing Samsung products in the future.If you're having issues, google it, find yourself a local geek to go pick up the parts at Radio Shack, solder them in, and save some money. It's a 20-minute fix, mostly unscrewing screws from the back of the LCD and reattaching them later (driving time not included)."
1,"problem, but samsung came thru",i purchased this tv from amazon march 18 2008. it was great untill the warranty ran out 12 months later. now it takes about 10 min. to come on and every day is a little slower. i paid $1144.00 for it and to fix this problem is $1200.00 + labor. as long as this is the only problem i have with it i will not have it repaired. i will wait till it wont come on at all and then buy a new tv but not a samsung.06/05/08 revised--talked to samsung and they extended warranty to cover my problem.i will continue to buy samsung products after all.
5,Great HDTV!,"This is my second Samsung HDTV. I have a 3 year-old 56"" DLP that is still working fine. The new LCD makes a much better picture, very high contrast and detail, at less than half the cost. The picture was so bright that I had to turn it down. It is connected to our DishTV HDTV box via a 50' component cable. The very good looking swivel stand and small black frame are nice, but hiding the speakers in back slightly compromised the sound quality compared to my old TV. A little hollow sounding. That minor fault aside, this HDTV just jumped out and said buy me when I went to local video stores and made side by side comparisons. Amazon's price was by far the best. And even the wife loves it."
1,WARNING DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG TVs :designed to breakdown after using it for 1 year,"I purchased this TV for my office and never used it for one year because no one at the office had time to watch TV. We started using it occasionally during lunch time/ breaks for 1 year, it started making clicking sounds when we tried to turn it on. I called samsung and they asked for model number and when I told them they immediately responded by offering to repair one time for free. They took my information and told me service tech will contact me to schedule a repair. No one called for one month. I called again and they said they assumed I had fixed the problem myself. When I told them I had this problem with TV, they were very familiar with it and again took down my information. Do I think they will fix my TV by next month?Well all I can say is SAMSUCK!"
2,Turning on TV problem,"I have had this Samsung HDTV (LN-T4061F)for just under two years, and after paying the amount of money I did, I would have expected to have my TV for more years without a problem. But I do have a big problem with not being able to turn the TV on, just sits there and clicks, it used to come on after 5 or 10 minutes of clicking, but now it doesn't even come on. I have read that the problem is probably the capacitors on the power supply board and that Samsung knew about the problem but because it is out of warranty, they won't fix it. I just think that Samsung knowing about the problem should pay to get it fixed."
3,Good game but the Geo-Mod feature is barely ever useful,"This is a good FPS game, but I can't say there's much in the game that makes it shine above Half-Life - especially when you consider that Half-Life is about 4 years older than this game. The Geo-Mod technology is cool, but I can't remember a single door that I could blast through. Walls, yes, sometimes you can blow holes in these to useful effect....but doors, you wouldn't need to blast through anyway, because if there's something on the other side that's useful, then you can usually open them when you need to anyway. So, other than the Geo-Mod, which is seriously under-utilized since you can't use it everywhere, this is really just an okay game."
4,A Must Have,This game is the best yet. The Geo tech alows you to make holes in the walls expanding forever. The weapons are awesome. The only defect is that it is very hard. Download the demo at gamespot.com
5,Very fun FPS.,"Red Faction is a very good FPS, especially if you can't afford the more expensive titles. Single player mode is superb; neat storyline, excellent gameplay, cool vehicles. The weapons are some of the best I've seen; a rail gun that can see behind corners, the sniper rifle, the heavy machine gun. One drawback, though, is that most of the fighting takes place indoors, in darker areas. This game would have been even better if they let a little more light in. Also, the enemy characters can get a little annoying when they repeat the same phrases over and over (""I'll get you, miner!"", ""Try me, miner!""). Multiplayer mode is a blast - Geo-Mod really shines here. Definitely worth your money."
3,Like you ever use it,"First off, I'd like to say that Red Faction's premise is pretty cool. Rebeling against the enemy, following a mysterious character named eios, its all good. The first couple of levels are cool, and the guns are sweat, my favorite is the sniper rifle. But I found myself thinking, ""do I ever use the geo-mod technology?"" Honestly, its cool and all, but do you ever have enough rockets or explosives in handy to blow open a door, when you could just find a way to open it. Another complaint, although you can hijack 5 vehicles, you hardly ever use some, especially the driller. Hijacking should be a pivatle moment when you can use them against the ememy. In conclusion, Red Faction is a pretty good game, but has a few problems in it"
2,Mistique Eye Liner? Mistique Eye Mister,"Bought gold. Line's didn't seem to come out well AT ALL. It pretty much, instead of leaving a thick dark gold line, left an inevitably smudged out gold fine glitter mist. Don't know how the other solid colors stand up. Maybe they're not all the same. Also, bottle pictured is most likely Silver. My bottle of gold is CLEAR glass with the bottle looking GOLD because of seeing through to the gold liquid inside. They probably took the silver eyeliner and shook the bottle before the picture to fill the holes."
5,One Of The Best Industrial/Alternative Albums Out There,"If you like heavy industrial and/or alternative rock, this CD is a must. Great tracks are ""Surefire"", ""Home"" and ""Sparkle and Shine"". Perfect for the people who like Pitchshifter, Gravity Kills and Korn.Another great industrial album for Econoline Crush fans is ""Empty"" by God Lives Underwater."
2,Average album,"First of all, before i write the rest of this, i DO like EC. Don't get me wrong. There is one reason why this album never caught on in the US, it sounds just like everything else going on in american alt. rock. There are few US fans because of this, filter and a few other bands deliver the same sound and relitive lyrics. And one more thing EC tends to have this 'well, that sounds knida cool' mentality to song writing. They throw in little effects that are completely non-musical, this really ruins the intergrety of their songs (espc on TDYK), maybe they need a new producer or mixer. Everything they do sounds over-produced, i'm sure that they have an excellent live show, though."
1,very BLAND,"This cd has a few songs that rock to some degree, but after the first few songs, it turns to mediocrity. The songs don't stand apart in too many ways, and the first few songs on the album set you up for a big disapointment 1/2 way through the album, as they simply lost all desire to rock.They definately are NOT industrial, as some reviews have stated. True, they have some electronic elements, but that does not an industrial band make.Now I didn't go in thinking they were an industrial band, and wasn't mad because they weren't. I could care less. Good music comes in many packages, and this band is not it.If you are looking to ""rock out"", this is not the place to be. If you like the heavy guitar, stay away.However, if you are looking for simple music mixed with decent vocals and mediocre lyrics, give them a try."
5,"Without a doubt, OUTSTANDING!!!","I have yet to find a band/group that has a CD release that I will truly love every song. I finally have. I don't bother skipping tracks to another ""good"" song because they are all VERY GOOD. Every song is melodic and very professional. Listen close for the ear candy. A good stereo is needed to amplify all of it. Our local radio station plays six tracks from TDYK. The only thing is, I need more, more, more! More of their music."
4,It sounds like incredible optimism,"That said, there's still a lot of deeply sad songs. It seems though that he was still deeply optimistic about his career and for a good reason too! It's inspiring to me that this guy was just playing his old guit-ar in West Virginia for [...] bucks a night and after 30 odd years someone picks up his old record and re-releases it or rerecords it (I can't remember the exact details) and wam he's a born again STAR ya'll. Apparently they brought him up to this pyschobilly festival in NEW YORK CITY (shoots revolvers) where G.G. Allin opened up FOR HIM. Amazing. This tells me that if you have something you believe in and it's that crazy, sometimes people will believe in it too. Screw all the Nay-sayers. Hasil is KING!"
3,Worked at first,"Then it stopped working a few weeks after using the product. We had much better luck with flea shampoo and a flea bait, as these collars are worthless. We live in Utah with very cold, snowy winters, we have little if any problems with fleas in the winter and this product did not work during the winter. Going to try another companies products, don't waste your money."
1,does nothing for my cat's fleas,"Another product I tried for my indoor cat, who recently developed fleas since we moved here. He only has a few, but needed to get into action right away. After deep cleaning with flea shampoo, combing for several days, I then put this collar on. a few days later I combed him and fleas were just crawling around. None of these things seem to work. I have sprayed the carpets and stuff, I guess I will have to break down and spend the money on those drops everyone uses."
1,Cat Still Has Fleas,"I don't think much of this product...and neither did my cat. It didn't kill the fleas toward the tail end of my cat. He's a big kitty, but he's not all that long! I won't buy this again. Not strong enough."
1,Warning - wrong item!,"Be careful! I've bought this stuff a month ago, but they sent me totally different item. Different brand, color of glove, different color of rubber, different kind (and quality) of rubber. On the picture it looks like- nice fancy gloves. But what you get- is very cheap, streaky-rubber,bad quality..I've been purchasing similar gloves for a 14 years, and this one was my worst deal ever... I did not like it at all, and returned it. But when I contacted a seller, they disagree - that it is different item.Finely I've got a refund (not a %100, they probably charged me for shipping). And I am OK with that, I just don't want to deal with them any more..."
3,not very good for working at airport,"I'm a baggage handler and these gloves were not very good. I wore the rubber off in just two flights. They say crinkle pattern but they're just dipped in blue rubber that is not thick at all. Only good part is that you get alot of them in the pack so when they wear out super fast you just go grab another pair. Come to think of it, that's not a good thing. These might be good for your grandma to do light gardening with, they're not very good for actual work"
4,Worth what you pay,"I have used these gloves for a few weeks now and I am satisfied with their performance. You can tell the difference when putting these on versus the ""Name Brands"", but if you use them for gardening or yard chores they stand up almost as well. You absolutely cannot beat the price. The quality is a little lower, but unless you are really hard on your gloves you wont notice much difference."
4,"Perfect for a 17"" toshiba laptop.",Really nice heavy duty bag with hand and shoulder strap. I would rather have metal carrying strap rings instead of plastic.
3,Case Logic case,"I like to have a 17 "" laptop for spreadsheets and also for gaming. I travel a lot so it is awkward carrying a big computer around but it is still worth it to me so I can help fight the bordem of hotels. The case seems to be made well but I am only giving it two stars because it is a pretty tight fit and gets to be a pain after a while. They should build the case a little wider."
3,OK,It's ok. Could be better.Zipper binds and inside straps get in the way of the zipper.It does what it's suppose to do for the money.You get what you pay for
4,Fits perfectly!,"Laptop Case was true to advertised description. Met expectations for the great price. 17"" Laptop limited choice locally and Amazon.com secured the best product available. Only regret is the strap attachment broke within the first week. My Opinion is that the snap closure is a design flaw."
4,Roomy and inexpensive,"It is the right size for my laptop and there is room for all the accessories I need to carry, I probably needed something roomier, but for this price I couldn't ask for more. I am happy with it."
5,Great case,"I've had the Case Logic case for more than a month. This case is large enough to fit my 17-inch laptop with a little room on the side to spare. There's plenty of space in the two front pockets for the cords, CDs, notebooks, pens, small book, point-and-shoot camera, even a little sleeve for the flashdrive or a key, and more. Inside is another sleeve to slip paperwork or newspaper (maybe not the New York Times, but that might fit on the back outside sleeve that has Velcro. I like being able to keep the laptop in the bag to work on it, too. Zips are great; there's a handle and comfortable shoulder strap.This is my first computer and I had no idea which case I'd like. I read through many customer reviews on many products before deciding on this one. I picked a winner, and I love it."
2,Too Small,The case is too small.It just fits the laptop with no place for laptop accessories.Not even for laptop battery.I wouldnt suggest this case .
4,very nice laptop case,"Haven't used the case yet but it looks very nice and seems to be made of good, high quality materials. The plastic shoulder strap hooks may be a weak link but that is to be determined. All in all I am pleased by what I see in this bag."
5,Great computer Laptop Case,Plenty of room for my laptop plus power supply and mouse. Use it to store the laptop and for travel. Good value for the price
2,Poor handle,"After using the case about 3 months, the carrying handle broke loose on one end. Also, the strap on clip broke. I would not buy this case again!!"
3,Computer Bag,"Bag is well made but could be about 1"" bigger to give more room for cord and a place to carry a mouse."
3,flimsy clips,"the bag barely fit my 17.1"" laptop. the bag itself is not bad, but then the retaining clip broke after a week. The retaining clip is the one that goes in and out and prevent the plastic clip to slip out of the hole. It still works now, but have to becareful when you sling it over your shoulder."
4,"Great case, but don't expect it to last too long...","I bought this bag a couple years ago. After several months, the zipper on the front-most compartment (for brochures/maps) fell off, stitches were coming undone all over, and the plastic-fabric covering the handle had several cracks, with pieces falling off. For the money I spent on this product, I expected it to hold up a little better. Now, it looks like its been through a war zone."
4,Just fine,This bag was just fine for what I needed it for and I was able to put my 17 inch laptop and accessories in it just fine.
2,You get what you pay for,"It looked like a good deal. Within two months of purchase the clip that attaches one side of the shoulder strap to the side of the bag broke so I had to gerry-rig a fix. Soon thereafter the carry handle broke. I compared it to my wife's bag and noticed the carry handled on hers is riveted, not sewn -- it makes a difference.You get what you pay for."
2,"Locking Pin missing, was not expecting this thing....","I got the laptop case, which is pretty good, but locking pin for one of the shoulder strap is missing, which is pretty anoying.Now, dont know what to do?Think before buy...Thanks,Amit"
4,Great Laptop Carry Case,"The quality of this laptop carry case is very good. It is made of sturdy material. A 17-inch laptop fits well except you will have to remove the velcro separator (which normally holds the brick and cords) in order for the 17-inch to fit. I like the clamshell design because it makes it easy to place the laptop in the bag. There is a velcro strap to hold the computer in place. There's plenty of room to place some folders on top of the laptop. The only drawback is that there is not much depth. There is a zippered pocket in the front to hold a mouse, cords, etc; but there is no other zippered compartment in the back of the bag, just a pocket for papers or a folder. However, it suits my needs, the price was very reasonable, and I am happy with it."
1,Use a tall kitchen bag instead,I have a Fellows SB-97Cs and use tall kitchen bags. They are more durable but do require a bit more care during installation.
1,Bags for schredder and oil for schredder,Found out regular discount store garbage bags work just as well and cost less. The oil is a neccesary evil to keep schredder working properly.
2,These bags are not so good.,The bags that came with the shredder were perfect.These replacement bags fit but are smaller and lighterweight.Tall kitchen size garbage bags work well as a substituteand are more easily tied closed.
3,Warning for DVD Buffs!,"This is a great set to buy if you have kids who don't care about special features. This set presents just the movie with a few extra bells and whistles. However, if you're a huge fan of these films, as I am, there's better versions packed with special features. Toy Story & Toy Story 2 can be found together with each disk filled to the brim of special features along with an additional disk of special features. This is called the Toy Story Toy Box. Bug's life has another version other then the Gold version presented in this box set. It's a collector's 2 disk edition, also packed with special features (returning in August 2003). These are the definitive versions of these movies. Don't buy this box set if you're looking for more. If you have kids, it's fine ..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!,"We purchased one of these last month, all it managed to do was destroy the DVDs that were played.What's even worse is the service we received from Audiovox. They first told us that they wouldn't take the product back because we were playing defective DVDs in it. Then They wanted to send a refurb in exchange for a brand new player. Then we forced the product return.We still haven't resolved the issue of replacing or paying for the brand spanking new DVDs that the Audiovox player ruined. Audiovox is entirely unwilling to make any effort to resolve this.Don't buy this player. I would go as far as to say if you are smart you won't buy ANY Audiovox product. You would be taking too much of a risk on reciving a poor quality product AND too much of a risk of reciving poor (and rude) customer service."
2,"Great, when it worked.","I bought this toy about 6 months ago. It worked great in the car on road trips, to keep the kids happy. Over the next few months, more and more movies quit working (locked up, skipped, etc.) The same movies still played fine at home on the set-top unit. After reading more reviews, this seems to be a common ""feature"". Needless to say, I returned it and bought a 9"" TV/DVD combo that would run on AC or DC. All of the ""defective"" movies play without a hitch. This one is no where near as small or as cool but it works so that makes the kids and me happy."
2,potluck player,"Agree with most others. If you got a good one, your fortunate. First one soon skipped and froze badly. Would not play 50% of DVDs and performed poorly on ones that did start. I returned it last week after 9 months ownership and in 7 days a new unit arrived! Good CS dept in NY. So far so good. Looks like a different (better?) lens trolley component in this new one. I also concurr with those who owned the other model - my bud says he has had no problems with that one. Just runs hot. Your 2nd warrantee only lasts 60 days, so I will act quickly if this one starts acting up. A truly amazing machine when it works right."
2,"Great idea, terrible implementation, price is unforgivable","First off ... the price of this 300 page book is unforgivable. I hope this isn't a trend. This was the first book devoted soley to JSP to be published and I needed it for my job. However, I am halfway thru it and feel I wasted my money on this one. IMHO ... The examples are VERY confusing, Javabeans are used early on with almost no explaination, XML-style tags are used but the differences between these and the older version implementations are not explained, no usable information on JSP engine implementations, once Javabeans ARE explained ... the explaination was very poor IMHO, etc. ... etc .... In my opinion, it's just really not a good book (at least for beginners). From what I've seen thus far, there are NO good beginning JSP books out yet. And I been lookin'!"
3,OK to learn JSP,"I really enjoyed the fundamentals this book explains, however, if you do not have a working enviornment established at home - you better be able to develop your enviornment with no help from this book. Content on JSP great - helping you set up a work enviornment to test your pages - horrible."
3,The devil is in the details,"I consider myself fairly auto-didactic, and indeed this book starts out OK for someone with HTML experience and a general technical background. But the implementation of the CD seems like the author passed it off to someone else and never did any quality control. I abandoned the Tomcat server on the CD, got a great one for free off the net (Allaire Jrun 3.0) and with the help of an experienced Java programmer managed to debug the examples up to the chapter on databases. At this point, I realized that there is no way to duplicate this books examples without previous experience at compiling and installing a database from it's source code - hardly the realm of the target reader. Computer books should be better than this."
5,Great way to teach equitte to a small child,"I use this tea set to teach my child how to act at the table, when and how to use the knife and forks, saucers etc. I don't like that is very easy to break, the set should of being made out of more durable material, but other than that I love it and she loves it. We can't stop having tea party and picinic."
5,Nakoa's Woman,I first read this as a paperback. Generally I don't keep paperback romance novels but this has been on my shelf for over 20 years and moved with me from Canada to Texas. An excellent book. Thanks to the internet I've discovered there is now a sequel. Was there ever a movie made?
5,Great book.,This is one of the best books. I first read this book about twenty or plus years ago. They story just brings the reader into the book. I have read this book three times now and will read again. Highly recommend it.
1,Large Print and only One Volume of Two,"""Robin"", by Frances Hodgson Burnett is a lovely slightly gothic romance with many of the bells and whistles that the author is known for: dreams, miracles, other-wordly stuff that we are so familiar with in ""Secret Garden"". However, I DO NOT recommend this paperback edition. It's over-priced and it's only the first of two volumes. Save your money. Buy ""Robin"" second hand or take it out of your library. Unless you need to read jumbo print, this is a silly investment for a paperback."
1,At least it arrived,Pretty flimsy setup - no automatic cutoff for the warming plate. Not worth a bit more than it costs.
2,Unrealistic,"Okay, I think this book was so unrealistic. I mean come on! If the girls in the BSC were really Mary Anne's friends they would have been supportive even if they didn't like her hair."
2,Give me a break,"Come on, let's be realistic. Would her friends really get all huffy and leave her out for a week and a half just cuz she got her hair cut? If my friends did that, I'd shoot them. It was nice to have someone actually interested in something an eighth grader is interested in, like image or clothes(but we're not talking supermodel Stacey-this is middle school, not modeling). Nice try, Ann, but this one doesn't cut it."
3,Her friends' reactions made no sense,"This book is enjoyable, but I honestly didn't understand why the other members of the club, especially Kristy, acted the way they did just because Mary Anne got a haircut. I mean, it's her decision, not theirs. It just doesn't make sense. And even though I like Dawn, I didn't like her that much in this book. I think other people who like Dawn may feel the same way.Other than that, the book is fun to read and is definitelt a page-turner."
4,Good Surge Protection for the price,"Good basic surge protection while saving an arm and a leg. Suited well for home computer use. Backed with the APC warranty, how can you go wrong. The swivel AC plug is nice too."
5,A hard-to-put-downer,"While on vacation, it took me two days to read this delightful book. The characters span three generations and you are caught up in their lives individually and together. Two wonderful love stories are presented and it is wonderful how the author pulls past and present together. This is my first time to read Ms. Haeger, but I hope not my last."
2,Not Impressed,First I would like to say that Tracy Brown is a real good writer ( I love the book Black) however this book was not a page turner. I thought the book should of had more of Celeste and Ishmael involed together because in the descripition of the book it said ishmael confress his feelings to her. Through out the whole book i would say that were together about two times.
3,drama filled women,"dime peice was filled with a bunch of women that had nothing but hate for each other. the storyline went in so many directions that i was wondering what was the point to the story again? the first book i read by Tracy was white lines and i swear it was one of the best books i've read dealing with street life. i understand dime piece was in the begining so i'm hoping that twisted will bring it. Celeste, Charley and Robin are the prime exmaple of what men say women act like towards one another. although i know jealousy does exsist and beauty shops can be a great place to go for the latest dish these women went overboard all lustng after Ishmel. Celeste chose to be the mistress to rah-lo and had the best what could Ishmel offer her besides sleeping around on her without any regard. i started twisted today and i'm on page 70 something and the drama is slow coming but i'm going to hang in there to see where it goes."
3,Ehhh,Dime piece was an okay book. There was dramain the shop. Some parts of the book was hilariousMy biggest problem was the book barely focusedon the main character. Celest was barely part of thestory. Other than that it was a good book
4,Nice!!,"This book is somewhat not used, but it is worth the price, no pages were missing and looked somewhat new"
4,REAL simple recipes,This is a great cookbook with AWESOME pictures. The recipes are very quick and simple but I love to cook and some of them are no-brainers.
4,"go go power-wheels, Power-wheels power makes 'em go!","We love this truck, my daughter just got this Barbie Jeep for her 3rd Birthday and she is just thrilled with her new toy. Assembly was a bit more work then the reviews made it out to be. My first thought was to let the store put it together but after reading the reviews on this website that said it was ""quick+easy"" my husband and I decided to give it a try. It took about two hours (we took a few break's.)We took our daughter to a big field where she could practice her steering and get a feel for the gas pedal.This toy also has great developmental benefits such as eye-hand & eye-foot coordination. It also helps to stimulate their imagination."
1,"Not Helpful, Not Good for Beginners:","This game makes it harder for beginners to start. First, all of the new rides haven't been made for you (not saying that they are all supposed to be made). Second, the parks do not have anything to do with building the ultimate theme park. Third, whoever wants to buy this game I think shouldn't."
5,Would Not Install on Windows Vista,"I was very unhappy to discover that I could not successfully install this game on my Windows Vista laptop. I loved playing this game on my XP, but unfortunately technology has just advanced too much to handle the older games."
4,Loopy Landscaps is not the best but good,"Okay I will first say the bad things then I will move to the better things.One of the worst things about loopy lanscapes is you can't charge money for addmission. That is bad because you won't make as much money than in the first ROLLERCOASTER TYCOON. The other bad thing in LL(loopy landscape)is that they don't give you that much new Rollercoasters, but the ones they give you are great.The best thing is one of the first five levels you choose from is a great one because you get as much time you want and as much $ you want. Another great thing is that there more senarios. It also comes with more senery and shops to choose. If you really like ROLLERCOASTER TYCOON you should get this but if you think ROLLERCOASTER TYCOON is boring than I wouldn't recomend it."
5,Roller-addict,"I have been playing RollerCoaster Tycoon for six months now. With no book to learn from, I have learned to play pretty well. It is teaching me alot about finances and organization of running a business. I would like to find some more add-ons for this game. I notice there are more to be added. Can't wait till more are available."
4,a fantastic PC game,"This was a very entertaining game for a very long time but then it started to get boring after a while. I would reccomend this game for younger kids like 7, 8, or 9. You would make your own roller coaster park and I usally did play the easiest one with no water around just so that it would be more fun. but sometimes its fun playing the hard parks because its more challenging and you have to use more money. But, anyway if u like to play the computer in your spare time i would get this game. (But if u have a little bro or sis the will probably want to play it all the time so play it when you can.)"
2,ehh,"Didnt know alot about Amps or RMS or max wattage before i bought this, but now i do, if your running subs off this your stupid like me then cuz at 4 ohms the most youll ge is 25 watss , not enough to even move my two 12s, go of RMS ratings, not max"
3,good for some standards.,"at around 400Watts peak. 200-250rms per channel in REALITY. works great bridged over mono channel on a 15"" 600rms woofer. will run two low powered 12"" woofers allright as well. for the price id buy again. but if your looking for REAL POWER spend a lil more cash and buy a real amp like JL rockford fosgate or Crunch."
2,Worked for two weeks,"It was cheap so I got it, and it worked pretty good, until i changed a setting one time, then it turned off and wont turn on, I checked fuses and wiring. It just stopped. All I wanted was something cheap that would last, deffinatly not this."
2,Horrible Amp!! >:(,"Ok..I am new to the whole car audio arena and i wasn't really sure which amp to buy. After a few searches I came across this amp (my search's main intention was the price and the power it is qualified for). There were a few good reviews and some bad.Let me get to the good ; It actually pushes my 12-inch 1200w subwoofer.Now to the bad; IT GETS REALLY HOTT! I mean I cud actually cook something on the amp!! I was suggested to use a really thick wire to power it [from the car battery] and even though i fulfilled this task,guess what? IT STILL OVERHEATED! My opinion was to put a computer fan right under the amp (but that would look just silly)My main statement is, if you are serious about your music, get an amplifier that is reputable of getting the job done. INVEST A LITTLE MORE and you will be more happy than me."
1,do not purchase,"i bought this amplifier just becuase it was cheap, and it is CHEAP, first one didnt work out of the box, sent it back got a replacement, worked for 2 days something went wrong smelled like something was burning, so i shut it off and it never worked , so i got my money back, what a WASTE of time, my suggestion is, atleast put a lil more money into the budget not sayin u need buy like a 2-300$ amp, just not this one.."
2,"Do not get this amp if you have two 12"" s","I have two 12"" MTX Term's and I purchased this inexpensive amp to run it. I had it professionally installed, and it was extremely disappointing. Only certain songs with major bass would make my two 12""s pound running from this amp. Average songs on the radio or cd would barely even register much bass at all. I am returning my amp, and I've ordered a Kenwood amp that has true 1000w power unlike this amp. For several more dollars you can literally double/triple the watts going to your speakers.If you have one 12"" or 10"" this amp will probably do fairly well. If you are running two 12"" s and want bass, do not get this amp."
2,Good while it lasted,So I bought this amp because it was a lot of watts for a cheap price but 2 weeks later after installing it it only works at like 200 watts because it over heated so its better to spend more on somthing good.
3,It's alright,"I bought one of these for my 2 ten inch Pyle Blue Label subs. The subs themselves are 600 peak. Their in a bandpass box and I wired everything like it's supposed to be. The amp gets pretty hot after maybe 10 minutes of playing and it produces a hot electronic smell as well, not sure if that's normal, I'm assuming not. It powers the subs pretty well with each sub to their own channel. It's enough for a loud experience in the car, not so much out. It'd be ok for a quick band aid, but i wouldn;t suggest it for permanant solution. It'll be a good amp to mess around with until I can get more money for a better quality amp as well as the pyle subwoofers, good band aid until I can get money for better quality."
3,Lacking in features,"It was with strong anticipation that I awaited the delivery of the Bible. I had aleady started copying notes from my present Bible so that the transition could be quicker.It was early during the transfering of notes to the new Bible that I became aware that there were no introduction and background at the beginning of each book. I later found them past the index and even they were brief.Also it is lacking in charts in appropriate sections of Scripture that help to pinpoint people and events.Zondervan's Reference Edition is superior in this regard.On the plus side the Bible is ""sewed"" instead of just glued. A valuable feature.Hopefully this review will encourage Foundation Publications will take steps to adjust this matter in later printings.Really love the NASB . . . been using it for eleven years and find it to be extremely accurate from the original(s). Just miss the extras."
5,One Of The Best,"Now THIS GAME I COULD NOT WAIT FOR!! LOL. Seriously after I beat Shenmue 2 I was like looks like im going for Lan Di on part 2. So I was really hyped up about this game. The graphics are better than ever. Alot more people you interact with, and alot more fighting scences. This game is off deeeee H0000k."
2,"you'll get tired of it, save your counter space, money,time","This thing is like any new toy that is fun for a while but after the novelty wears off it's way too much of a pain to keep doing. After you use the juicer there are about seven parts to clean. You must first disassemble the thing and clean all the parts and I was shocked at the reality of what a pain it is based on other reviews. And really it can be messy. On the positives, it really does extract a lot of juice from the fruit and the juice is very good. The pulp does not have a lot of wasted juice in it, almost none. I've had mine for about three months now and I feel my enthusiasm waning. I think it will soon find a rather indefinate place next to our bread maker on the shelf of unused appliances."
1,Junk!,"First antenna worked for three days, then broke. Second antenna broke same day. Seriously, how hard is it to make an XM antenna that works??"
4,You'd Better Have A Fast System If You Want to Play This,"I played this game in multi-player mode with a friend, and had a ball until the lag kicked in. We were playing on a network server using P3 500Mhz PC's, and at one point, the lag got so bad we had to re-boot our machines. We downloaded the patch, and it didn't help. I've played multiplayer mode in plenty of graphic-laden games (new and old) on this PC/network server before, but I've never had this kind of problem. Summoner is a fantastic game, and once you get used to the funky camera angles, you become completely absorbed in the story and gorgeous graphics. I just hope your system is faster than mine, or you're bound to get frustrated. I'll still play this game, but will always have the worry that I'm going to have to re-boot during a battle again."
2,"Good at explaining the basics of GPS, VERY poor reference for actually building a software receiver","This book does a good job at explaining the fundamentals of GPS operation. It breaks things down to an understandable level and presents most material well. However, it is not thorough enough to be used to design a software receiver. The book covers Costas loops and DLL's in a very cursory manner. It is also filled with typos and other errors. If your actually attempting to build a software receiver, try some of these books: ""Understanding GPS Principles and Applications"" by Elliot Kaplan (Ed.), ""Global Positioning System: Theory and Applications Volume 1"" by B. W. Parkinson and J. J. Spilker (Ed.'s), ""Global Positioning System: Signals Measurements and Performance"" by P. Misra and Per Enge. These books are far more detailed and are relatively free of errors."
4,toothaches suck,"My filling fell out, I was in pain and awake all Saturday night & had to work on Sunday...aggh and still my tooth was hurting. OTC product actually sent me into a jaw grabbing fit as it burned my gum/nerve, w/e, before temporarily numbing. At work, my co-worker had me try this exact brand of clove oil. I applied it to my tooth/gum area with a q-tip. O my goodness it tasted nasty & burned my tongue & lips...but within seconds my toothache stopped (so did the nasty taste & burning). I didn't have to reapply for about 8 hrs. So today, I am online buying it! My dentist appt is Tuesday but I'm gonna keep this stuff handy. And do be careful when applying, use a qtip & touch only the tooth area."
4,Helped me with my teeth!,This stuff is EXCELLENT for numbing your gums. I had an abscess and it worked better than oragel for it. This stuff tastes just as foul but it works amazingly well. Great to have around.
1,Complete Garbage,"My friends and I joke about the worst video game ever, not surprisingly, this always wins. This game is so terrible I wish I could rate it no stars or even negative. The manufacturers should be paying you to take this off their hands so they can be wiped clean of what a bad job they did. The mechanics and movement are a bit too tough for younger kids and by the time they develop the skills to be able to perform the actions the game is already boring. DO NOT buy this game or rent it or even think about it other than to quote it as being the worst ever. If you want to see how bad it possibly could be then go ahead and pick it up if you can get it for very cheap. I would advise you to just take my word on how horrible this game is though and save yourself some anguish and night terors."
1,Worst Game Ever,"This game was truly [...]. Not simple enough for really young kids, and beyond boring for older ones. You can't even just run around freely. It's like you can only go left or right and then choose a direction at specific ""intersections"". Absolutely terrible. Avoid this one like the plague."
1,"Zero Fun, Zero Graphics","If only I had known...almost an arcade style or 1 dimensional view. Dumb, Dumb, Dumb..Kid's 10 & 8yo won't play it."
3,Not if you add milk to your coffee...,"I've had this mug for less than 2 years, and the rubber seal on the lid has stretched, allowing the mug to leak. I guess this is due to the fact that I have had to remove the rubber ring to completely clean the lid. I always have milk in my coffee, and even after regular cleaning, the lid would start to smell like spoiled milk after a few days. I soon realized that I had to take apart the lid to fully clean it, and it seems this has shortened the life of the lid.However, a friend who takes his coffe black has had the same mug for several years with no complaints."
5,Nissan thermos,"I have two of these (and two of the 26 oz. water bottles) and they are great. Keeps everything hot or cold for hours and they are small enough on the bottom to fit both of them in the small cup holders on my Corvette. The 26 oz. water bottles I use when playing golf. I fill them 1/3 with ice and the rest water. When I come off the course 5 hours later in 95+ degree heat, I still have ice in the thermos."
3,Average?,"Did I get a defective Travel Mug? I hoped for something better when I ordered this Travel Mug for my wife. After three years of daily use of a Starbucks Travel Mug, one of the kids took it to school and we haven't seen it since. We tried another brand from Costco (sold in a two pack for less $) which keeps coffee hot for several hours without pre-heating, but it doesn't have any way to secure to her purse or gym bag. I liked the idea of the carabiner, along with several glowing reviews, so I bought it. A month later it sits having been used three times, forgotten, on the shelf, in the cupboard. Scalding coffee, straight from the percolator (coffeepot in which boiling water in a repeated process is forced up a hollow stem, filters down through ground coffee in a sieve like container, and returns to the pot below), is tepid within two hours at best. Defective? I don't know. But I don't recommend. On the plus side, shipping was quick, and the product arrived in great condition."
5,One of the best,"This cup not only keeps your coffee hot but it has a great feel in your hands. It's balanced. I'm not particularly fussyabout which cup I use but that's changing. This is definitely ""My"" cup."
5,Travel Mug,Wow!! I've carried several travel mugs to work over the years. The stainless steel ones weren't bad. The plastic ones were terrible...no handle and they spilled. This mug is terrific! I don't have to worry about a spill if I (not on purpose) turn it upside down. Not a drop leaked out!! Very pleased with this item.
5,The perfect to go cup,"It keeps coffee as hot as when you put it in the cup. Tighten the lid down and it stayed hot for over 6 hours, rolled all over and didn't leak. Grandson was playing with it and still held the hot coffee - I had to loosen the top to let it cool down. Attached the carabiner (sp) to my pack and it goes every where. Fits perfect in the car."
4,An excellent commuter mug,"I don't have anything to add beyond what has already been said, so here is an ADHD summary:Pros:Does not leakWarm to the last sipFits in most car cupholdersExcellent no-drip drinking designCons:Annoying ridge for where carabiner is meant to attach ruins tactile feel (I do not use the carabiner)Thorough cleaning can be a hassle"
5,Finally a mug that works,"I have tried many insulated coffee mugs that just don't keep drinks hot, this one works great and doesn't leak when you have it closed"
4,Great for everyday commute,We have two of these travel mugs. The mug does a good job of keeping coffee hot every day. Very easy to drink out of. Plus the handle makes it easy to sip while driving. The screw top works well to keep from spilling once closed. The only negative is that it is difficult to clean the top very well. The 2-piece design of the top is poor. It is a good idea to pop the top in two to clean inside of it.
2,Good but could be better.........,"The good - it keeps the drink hot for a long time (5 hours or so) and is nice and sturdy.The bad - the lid gets sucked down as the drink cools and sometimes you can barely get the thing unscrewed. To get it fully leakproof you have to get it screwed pretty tight.The better - Thermos Stainless King SK1005MB4 16-Ounce Leak-Proof Travel Mug. I love this model and is the one you should look at if you want a great, easy to use care-free mug that keeps your dirnk hot for a loooong time."
5,"If you ever find yourself on crutches, you want to find this mug","After ankle surgery, I resigned myself to having to drink energy drinks in the morning because obviously, full open containers of hot liquid and crutches do not mix. Don't get me wrong, I love energy drinks, but hot coffee in the morning is like a magical blanket of love cuddling you after having to drag yourself out of your comfortable bed.I have a Keurig - this was a concern as I was comparison shopping. The 14 oz Thermos Nissan mug fits perfectly (after removing the drip tray). It also hooks nicely onto my crutch, refuses to spill, and doesn't dribble on me. Add in that it kept my coffee piping hot after 2 hours, and suddenly I'm looking to divorce my husband and marry this thing. I'm even drinking decaf just to have more coffee, that's how thrilled I am. If I could drink out of two mugs at once, I'd buy a second one."
2,Can't get it open!,"Received as a gift since I have a tendency to spill liquids and forget that I have hot liquids until they are warm.The seal works great! I can throw it in my purse if I'm out of hands, I can toss it on the car seat. It will not leak! At all!I just can't get it open.Carpal Tunnel Syndrome may have made my hands weak, but not that weak! I refuse to go around and ask people to open my coffee for me and struggling with this cup is not worth pain in my hands."
4,"Good Album, worst sound I've ever heard, though","I bought ""From the Pagan Vastlands"" and ""Pandemonic Incantations"", the latter of which had a bonus live track that is also featured on this album. I loved the song so much I had to get this. I got it, and was blown away by the pagan spirit that Behemoth put into this album. Unfortunately, the sound is the worst of all albums I have. This does not hinder the feeling of the album and in fact helps it. If you are a TRUE black metal fan or a new black metal fan who is interested in one of the lesser known releases of the genre, get this. It's Great."
5,Clermont grandma,"This is a beautiful baby book, purchased for a baby shower gift and it has everything you would want in a baby record book. It will be for a baby boy."
5,Perfect for the not so diligent,"This is perfect for those who want to keep a baby journal but do not have the time to fill in every detail from every day. It hits the high points and provides plenty of room for personal notes without assigning a theme. I could have done without the picture frames but otherwise this is a great book for any new Mom, especially those who live a busy life but still want to cherish memories!"
2,"Cute, but not faith-neutral","My wife and I returned this journal; the characters are Christian-themed, and roughly half of the quotes are bible verses.Parents of other faiths (or none of the above) and those seeking a neutral journal will probably not find this one works for them. Other than that, the illustrations were cute and the rest of the design and production quality seemed fine."
4,I dig it.,The journal aspect of the baby book is very nice. I just wish there were not so many pages that require long lengthy letters. I was hoping for fill-in-the-blanks lazy keepsake book. There are lots of those which is great. Just a tad more work than I wanted to put in :-)
5,My Mommy Friend Loved it,I bought it for my friend's baby shower and she just loved it. She loved the baby growth chart and was amazed to see the cuteness and design/pattern. The Idea of providing frame to attach photos and envelope to keep stuff is really thoughtful. A good buy for the person who loves to write their pregnancy experience.
5,Excellent book. Lots of info.,"I found this book very informative. Null outlines so many practical reasons to give magnetic therapy a chance. I was impressed with the multitude of symptoms that can be treated. Although there are no guarantees, these treatments most certainly are worth a try! I am so impressed with these theories that I am now starting to sell these magnets, so that others may get similar help. Definitely a good book for learning the basics of magnetic therapy. I have already seen results with knee pain, and dry skin problems etc. So the author obviously knows what he is talking about."
5,AMAZINGLY TALENTED GROUP,"FOCS is an amazing group that takes Accapella to a whole new level. They don't use any instruments which is hard to believe but true, and they are even more unbelievable in concert. ""Wonders of the World"" is a great album. Each song is better than the last. I would highly recommend it."
4,It seems to work.,"Two dogs that used to rip out newly planted shrubs now are much less destructive. They leave the shrubs sprayed with Liquid Fence mostly alone. It has no harmful chemicals, so it is save for the animals."
5,Very Helpful,We ordered this for the step going from our garage into the house. It was the right size to manage the step and I like that it folds for easy transport. Very sturdy too and has nice traction.
3,Great product but make sure it fits!,"Loved the durability and functionality of this ramp. Quick shipping, and packaged well too. However, I had to return it because my electric wheelchair is 30"" wide (as this is advertised)....but the actual inside diameter of the ramp is less than that which made it too narrow for my wheels to fit safely. As long as you have a smaller wheelbase, 29 1/2"" or less, it should work great."
1,One Star Rating,"I was very disappointed with this seller & the product. The item wasn't at all as described in the description. I ordered a Prairie View Industries Portable Singlefold Ramp. However when it arrived, it was a wheelchair ramp but two very small lightweight separate pieces- not a singlefold ramp. They also stated to ship 1-2 business days & I did not receive the item until several weeks later. I tried to contact the seller via email several times throughout this process but never received a response. I would not recommend this seller due to these reasons."
4,Good and sturdy,"I have used this twice. Very portable and sturdy. I use it in loading my mobility scooter to the back of my SUV. I don't ride while loading, either push or use the scooter battery power, very slow speed. Works very well for me."
3,Surprisingly Fun... but Short,"I'll agree with the masses that this is (at last) a surprisingly good ""license game."" The graphics are pleasing, the gameplay enjoyable and the connection to the book solid. However (and you knew there had to be a ""however"" in there, didn't you?) the game is extremely short, features some (admittedly rare) exceedingly unintuitive puzzles and deliberately flouts some conventions of the Harry Potter universe. I cannot tell you how many times I almost threw the controller down in disgust when trying to sneak by a cadre of librarians or Slytherin brutes (a la Metal Gear). I suppose this sneak/stealth element of the game could have been put to good use, but it seems absurd to not allow Harry access to his Invisibility Cloak.Ultimately the game features enough of the Harry Potter world to make it entertaining, but it could have been much, much more. Here's hoping EA Games can make another quantum leap in quality when the next movie/game combo is released."
3,harry potter game was not much fun,"The game is cool when you get to go to classes and do Quidditch, but it is a very easy and quick game. I beat it in 2 days. If only when you beat the game you get to still got to classes and get grades. Then I would of given it a better rating."
4,lost without instructions...,"i bought this for my son used. the instruction book was not in the box. at the first of the game when harry falls through the fireplace into a room with laughing skull and shriveled hand, we can't get out of there. can anyone help us?"
3,harry potter 2 fenom or flop,this is a relatively fun game however it does have a few drawbacks such as the fact that you hardly learn any spells. i was nearly halfway through the game and had only learned 5 spells. another portion of this game that is extremely frustrating is attempting to sneak past prefects because it is almost impossible to be able to do in less then 8 or 9 times. my advice to potential buyers is to without a doubt rent this game first.
2,Quick and Easy Game,"This was the first game i purchased for the Gamecube and if they're all this quick and easy to finish then i'm thouroughly disappointed. The graphics are nice, but clearly the game is challenging only for a young child. Please rent and do not buy this game. You can finish it in one full day."
3,"poorly designed, too easy","poorly designed game, with only a few levels, a few simple workarounds to obtain items, and very little interaction with the other characters."
5,I LOVE this book!!!,"I bought this book in the Louvre Museum in Paris, where we were able to see some of the originals. They're compelling and just draw you in! This book allowed me to bring the paintings home, and study them. It's easy to read, and goes into detail explaining not only about Bouguereau, but also explains a lot of the detail and symbolism that he used in his paintings. So now I can enjoy them on a whole new level. I'm not a big art buff, but I know I'm drawn to his paintings, this was just a perfect book to cut my teeth on, and help to develop a better understanding of some very famous paintings. Buy the book. You won't regret it!"
4,C Trick: Sort of a Memoir,"I thought it was greatly amusing. For those of us that were in the Army and worked Field Station,it will bring back alot of memories. Even though this was before I served in Berlin,alot of the places mentioned I knew. The things that happened will make you look back on your time there and remember some of the crazy things that went on.I definately thought it was a good read. Well worth the money."
5,Cooper takes you back,"I read C Trick when it was first published. It is a first-hand account of the life of a soldier in Berlin during the cold war. This is not a spy novel, or a shoot-em-up thriller, nor does it have a sappy ending. This book is a true depiction of Cooper's time in Berlin. The best recommendation I can give to the book and Cooper is, ""This is all true."" I know, because I was there too, right along with the author and many other citizen-soliers from our unit."
2,Not worth the money,I did not feel there was a good description but wanted some Irish lullaby music for a new grandchild=would not recommend
4,not what i was hoping for,"i have the original cky's at home but they were vhs, and i was uner the assumption that these would be the same but they cut out at least half of the 2nd and 3rd movies... kinda upsetting. they did make it up a lil with some new stuff..."
3,A bit dated but still amusing.,"It's an ok few movies if you like jackass, just lacks polish that those movies have. The skits aren't built up enough and too much skateboarding."
1,Maybe fleas are getting immune,"I put this on my chihuahua few days ago and there is still fleas on her. I even sprayed my carpets and her bed with the Zodiac flea & tick spray. Not sure if that spray kill them b/c I can't really see the fleas, but I do see fleas crawling around my dog body."
2,meh. fairly useless.,I tried this product and didn't notice much of a change at all - other than adding another item for my dog to catch with his paw whilst scratching himself.
4,Good for its size and price,"Not even close to ISBN: 0894682199, but a good book, as anyone would expect from the Dorling Kindersley publisher, of a small size, and so with the reproductions of a decent, but not spectacular quality not allowing to study the colors, but sufficient to get familiar with the paintings, and a short, not analytical text, but presenting the background and history associated with the times and places, as the look inside option confirms."
2,Wrong color!!!,"Tool jar is fine, but I ordered gold and it arrived in red. Didn't think it was worth returning, but I was disappointed. How could red and gold possibly be confused!?!"
4,Perfect Size - Holds Everything!,"Received this crock along with a set of 3 canisters that I bought recently and love it -- doesn't take up a lot of space on the counter, but holds a lot. The only thing I added to it was to put some felt circles on the bottom so as to not scratch the countertop."
5,Anyone Who LIKES Harry Potter should play ths Game!,"This game was the most fun I had with my PS2 since Harry Potter and the Socerer's Stone was out. I just want to tell everone that if your Bagging on this game it's because you don't like Harry Potter in the first place, but anyone who does like Harry Potter will love playing this game.P.S. Anyone can play this game, if I can beat it in two days than anyone can !"
4,Good Game,"Pros:- Great Graphics- Great gameplay- Quiditch is cool- Lots of stuff to collect- Lots of adventure, mini questsCons:- Too easy at many points- It's beatable in 2 days- You can't die (little challenge involved)- Much of Hogwarts isn't available to roam aroundOtherwise, the game is great. My advice: don't buy it, rent it. This way, since you most likely will beat it within a few days anyway, you don't have to own it after you beat it."
2,Frustration,"This game is unlike most very frustrating, I found my self swearing at the T.V.I recomend somthing differt like GTA: Vice City."
1,this game ...,Harry Potter is the worst idea ever. ican't believe kids are actually in to it. i think harry potter should be ban from all shelves. it teaches kids bad things about witch craft and isnt good for anyone under the age of 13.
3,"Gee, It's Hard","OK, you know, I'm one of those people who really hates getting stuck on one thing and having to do it over and over. Well, that's exactly what you're going to do in this game. I myself have not gotten very far, because in the few times I've played it I've either gotten bored and walked away or gotten so frustrated I decided to go grab myself a soda. Besides being really really really hard, it takes forever to load. I mean, come on. Sometimes my dad says, ""OK, 15 more minutes of video game time and you have to go to bed."" I open a door, and it takes 10 minutes to get inside. I pay for a spell book, and before it's done loading I have to be forced to get into bed. Like I mentioned back there, it's kind of tough because you walk into a room, it takes a really long time to load, and you have to do this tiny thing and walk out, and it takes 20 minutes. And Hogwarts is just like a giant maze. So if you're one of the people like me, don't waste your money."
5,Amazing history.,I am very thankful that people like Gordon W. Prange researched and recorded the facts of the event for future generations.
3,Angieville: AVALON HIGH,"Meg Cabot does Camelot. King Arthur reincarnated as quarterback of the high school football team. What else is there to say? I think it's my favorite of her non-Princess Diaries books. Longer and denser than usual, with all those familiar characters. And, in the end, after you're sure you've pegged every one of them, Ellie turns out not to be the Lily Maid at all, but another more mysterious and oft overlooked member of the legendary cast. Though the two are vastly different, it would be fun to pair Avalon High with Lisa Ann Sandell'sSong Of The Sparrowin a discussion of contemporary revisionist approaches to Arthurian lore."
4,Not as good as her others,"I thought this book wasn't as good as Meg Cabot's other books. It was still interesting and very good though. The midevil theme was really cool and the way it turns out is neat also. I thought it could have been more in depth though than it was. The guy for example seemed a little dense. I think it would have been better if we got to know more about him. All in all, I would definately recomend this book to people who like Meg Cabot's other books."
4,fun read,"If you like the Arthurian legends, this is a very fun twist set in modern times. I'd like to read more."
3,A Mediocre Read,"I won't deny that this book was well-paced enough that it was difficult to put down. However, I rate it three stars because it is VERY predictable and Ellie is a Mary Sue to beat all Mary Sues.Is this ACTUALLY a Meg Cabot book, or is it just fanfic with her name attached?"
5,Definite,I just cant believe avalon high isthe best meg cabot book i have ever read i love the mystery in the old time mixed with the new times i just love it!
2,Uninteresting crime reports!,"One would have thought that a book relating the crimes of nine female serial killers would have to be fairly gripping. Wrong! This book reads like a homework report. The majority of the murderers have similar MO's. Mainly poisoners & baby stranglers from abused childhoods & total losers in the lottery of life. Not really sure what the author hoped to achieve here, but this was a wasted effort, at least as far as this reader was concerned."
3,Not So Good,"I bought this movie around 1 or 2 years ago along with Round 1 because the DVD Box Set is way too much money. This one is supposed to be a mix of CKY2K and CKY3. It is mostly CKY3. But, it does not have anything thats really good from CKY3, which is the shopping carts which were f'n crazy. It has ""Extras"" which is just the music video Right Here In My Arms by H.E.R. (And it is HER not HIM) Brans Freestyle, and one other thing. Which are all on 2K and 3 so its not really an extra.I would say to pick up the VHS Boxset which I have previously ordered for around 10 bucks new. Which is incredible compared to the DVD Box Set which I've seen go up to over 100 bucks, used!So yeah, only pick this up if you REALLY want it (which you shouldnt) or if you cant find the VHS Box Set"
5,great cd,"Im going to be short. I love this cd and coming from me that is a huge compiment. I listen to alterative rock and puck music, but when i heard Help Pour out the Rain and Sweet Southern Comfort I loved them. Buddy Jewel is a great artist that can grab anyones attention. Buy this CD."
4,as for david,I am relieved not to be David's psychologist or his anything as I can only imagine what temperament or personality is necessary to cause such anger and hatred toward such time honored and lovable characters. I am forced to wonder if he would also cheer the hunter who shot Bambi's mother. Perhaps he would find Hanibal Lector a more appealing character.
4,"Nature-worship links pagan, Christian, and many other religions","This is a very interesting read. Varner follows a clear line of ""The Green Man"" or nature spirits from ancient Phoenicians and pre-Columbians to Romans, right on into Christianity. The book could have used more careful editing, or just one more draft, as some of the information is repeated and the logic is sometimes circular. It is excellently annotated though, so it leads you to many other good works."
1,scratches acrylic aquariums..beware,"this dang thing scratched my acylic aquarium the first time I used it. Nothing was between it and the aquarium, no stones, debris etc. It was a brand new magnet on a fairly new aquarium. Sorry I ruined my tank with this piece of junk. Use at your own risk..."
3,they really mean mini,it works fine. you just have to go slower cuz the magnet it weaker. would bebetter on a thin plastic tank but the glass on mine is thickwe so its a little trickier.
1,not worth it,"rent it see how you like it, i would say that its not worth the money. The game has nice graphics but thats about it. The gameplay is simple but the camera is always off slightly making Harry hard to control, it is next to nothing like the book, don't expect it to be like the book or the movie the game is completley different. it's also far to easy, the game tells you exactly what to do. I would recommend the game for younger gamers 6-13."
3,helpful.....,"i would think this book would be for 25+or so actors...i looked through all the monologues and as a teenager, i didn't find a lot of them very interesting or appealing. this book is definetely not a book for beginners because a lot of the monologues are to long for a beginner....."
1,Now what I was expecting,"In my opinion, these monologues were really outdated and most of them were set before the 1900s. Really found this book kind of useless."
5,Buy It Now!,"This game calls for one to four players. At the beginning you choose one of three monsters. Your monster has all kinds of fighting techniques. For example, hand punches, kicks, and other powers like fire balls and lasers are some of the abilities of the different monsters. Defeat the other monsters and win addtional monsters and levels. Do you see now why they call this ""Destroy All Monsters""? Buy it now! This is a tremendous action game."
4,great game,"Great game for kids. No blood or gore, just big rubber monsters bouncing around on the screen knocking cartoon buildings down. Sort of a WWF wrestling with those classic monsters. Lots of hidden moves, button combos, etc. You will need a GameCube controller if using a WII as the WIImotes dont have enough buttons on them to control the monsters as designed originally for the GameCube. They are under $10 online. You also may want to get a GameCube/Wii memory card if you want to save your points. Graphics are good, commentary in game is a little weak. Story is thin. My 11 year old pretty much beat the game after a week, but still plays with 6 yr old brother who can still beat daddy."
1,Bad quality,"I had it repaired within 1st month bought it. The image was distorted, and there are many dark horizontal lines through. The service center was prompted though, they told me something wrong with the lens barrel, and had it fixed on the same day. But then 1 month after the repair, similar problem came back. There are many dark horizontal lines, and image is over-exposed. I'm gonna send in for another repair soon. Although the features are good, I don't think the quality is good, especially there are a lot of image noise when taking pictures in the dark. Also, it's quite noisy when you zoom in and out. The image is quite blur at night."
2,This was a disappointing purchase,"A triangle with little self-esteem visits a ""shapeshifter"" several times looking for new experiences and true happiness. The outcome is predictable. The story is trite. But the big question is, what grade level was this intended for? Certainly not k - 2 with such references as the Pentagon building and top secret information. And my 4th graders find the story boring. Finally, so very little conceptual development is established by this book it's hardy worth the investment. The idea was good. The storyline needs serious attention. It gets two stars for potential."
5,Great Career Textbook,"This was one of the best career management books I have read. It is unfortunate that material like this is not included as part of a college curricullum, whether its in B-School or otherwise. The framework presented in this book is clear, concise and easy to follow. The examples are terrific. While reading Five Patterns I gained a better understanding of why certain things in my career worked better than others and where I might make a few adjustments."
4,Detailed Wine Sensory Book,"This is a great book for anyone interested in a broad overview of Wine Sensory. The book is extremely detailed (especially in the chapter discussions), but useful. Great for college students."
1,"Buy the paperback, not the Kindle version","Unfortunately, the Kindle version has numerous misspellings and worst of all, the many charts that are crucial to an understanding of the book, cannot be magnified enough to read them. Buy the paperback for a few dollars more and get better quality."
1,Zero Stars,"Although the song titles make it sound compelling, don't fall for it. This CD is less than 13 minutes long. If it was an impressive 13 minutes, that would be different. Like the fortune cookie says ""A Fool and His Money Will Soon Be Parted."""
4,thought provoking...,"I liked this book. I found it suitable for any religion. At first, I thought it was going to be too ""New Age"" for me, then I decided I was being too closed minded and relaxed, just took it in. Soon I was gaining in a positive way. I will reread this for a pick me up. Also, I copied several phrases from the book to use as reminders of daily encoragement. I wanted to give it a 5, however couldn't because I am not sure I would feel totally comfortable sharing or gifting this book to just anyone. It does require some basic free thinking and application of one's own faith journey to be successful, I would be afraid some wouldn't get past some of the open ended concepts of the journey...maybe not, maybe I am still too closed minded, read it and find out for yourself, let us know!"
2,Bored,This story of a chid id poverty-stricken India was hard to keep reading. The lack of plot put me right to sleep. I got a few chapters in and couldn't finish it. Don't waste your money on this.
3,NBA 2K2 TO NBA 2K3 WHAT THE HELL,"MAN I LOVE NBA2K2 IT WAS LIKE THE BEST B BALL GAME I EVER PLAYEDSO I BOUGHT THIS NBA2K3 OVER KINGDOM HARTS, AND NOW I WISH I COULD JUST GO BACK IN TIME AND BUY KINGDOOM HARTSPROS(to me)-GOOD DRIBBLING-OK COMP AI-OK LOOKING PLAYERSCONS(to me)-NOT FUN-YOU WILL BE BOARED AFTER ONE GAME-NO 3 POINT SHOOTOUT OR DUNK CONTESTIF U LIKE B BALL, THEN GO OUT AND PLAY B BALL DONT BUY THIS GAME"
2,Are you OK ???,"No Yao ???? Somebody got to be fired at Sega Sports; the # 1 draft pick is not in the game, the one who was portrayed in the tv spot of EA sports the day of the drat guarding Shaq, 5 minutes later of the selection by Houston Rockets. By the way this game is coping all the wrong things of NBA Live series ( slowness, etc ) and forgettin the fact that they are the team to beat. Definetely a step back for Sega sports."
1,Not for Beginners,"In my opinion, this may be a good reference book if you already knowJ2EE, but it is not a good book for learning J2EE.In general, this book talks about J2EE concepts, but it does not teachthem.All too often, the authors explain concepts in terms of concepts thatthey have not explained. In many cases, they don't give usefulexamples or illustrations in their explanations. Thus, in order tofollow many of their explanations, you have to already know theconcepts.After studying seven chapters in this book, I decided to look elsewhere.Because I believed that this book would be a useful tool in my effortto learn J2EE, and because it has not been very useful in that effort,I will only give it one star."
1,How did this ever get distributed?,"I find it so hard to believe that the world is so starved for ... movies that this title needed to be released to the public? It is quite simply one of the worst films I have ever seen. Other than sloppy editing and the addition inappropriate score, there is no post filming production whatsoever.Don't be fooled by the cover it has nothing to do with the movie.I do believe the movie has one possible redemption. it could be used to show film students how NOT to make a film on a $1000.00 budget."
1,"Not Gideon, by any means","Save your time and skip this one. Although it has a great opening scene, the rest of the book fails to deliver the sustained pace and excitement of Gideon, which was a great guilty pleasure read. There are several plot twists which are incredible (this is not a compliment) and you will feel at the end of 540 pages you could have done much better. In fact, in one part of the book, Andrews calls out a character who has read everything by authors like Block, Connolly, and others. Read all of them first before you invest time here."
4,Violent Thrills Abound!,"I would have given this book a ""5"" if not for the extreme violence which is unsettling for me personally but might be an attraction for other readers. The main character Jack, demands empathy and experiences the polar opposites of total bliss and dark pain throughout the book.I highly recommend it!"
5,The best potty book in town,"Short, simple, and absolutely adorable. My daughter, Sophia loves Hannah and her potty. DEFINITELY one for the potty training 2's. It's a must have!"
3,Potty Pooper,"I ordered this book from Amazon based on other reviews, but I must say that I found it lacking and had to buy another to supplement. Unlike some other potty books, this one doesn't cover wiping with toilet paper, washing your hands or flushing. I also prefer books that offer a chart for sticker rewards. On the positive side, it rhymes, I do like that it suggests the potty be given as a ""present"", and that the little girl gets to pick out her own underwear once she is ready, but I find the omissions too great to give the book a higher rating. Good luck potty training!NOTE: for more of my book reviews, music reviews, recipes and Southern musings, visit my blog at: SouthernAsBiscuits.blogspot.com"
1,Buy a different book!,This book sucks. The picture does not look like a toilet or a potty chair. It did not hold the attention of either of my children. The lift a flap book by Katz was much better at getting them interested because the pictures actually look like a toilet and the kids get to turn the flap. Don't waste your money on this one.
4,Great Book,This is a great book and we read it while we are sitting on the potty waiting for something to happen.
4,Good book for beginning potty training,"My almost-two year old loves this book. I like how positive the message is -- if you have accidents along the way, that's okay. The illustrations make this book -- super cute. My daughter has renamed the book ""Hannah Potty book."""
3,"So, so book",My little one loves book but this book fails to keep her attention through the whole thing. I really didn't feel like it was focused on learning to use the potty either.
2,"Too long, not to-the-point","I don't care for this book at all, and neither does my 18-month-old. It's too long, with all these side details that aren't even about the potty. I'm bored when I read it, and my little one usually doesn't let me finish. At least I can use the pictures on some of the pages (while skipping the others) to tell my own version of the story in my words, so it's not a complete waste."
4,almost perfect,"This is the second novel in the ""Bridgeton"" series...following ""The Duke and I"" and followed ""An Offer from a Gentleman"" ""Romancing Mr Bridgerton"" ""To Sir Phillip, With Love"" and soon...""When He was Wicked.""This is the story of the oldest Bridgerton sibling, Anthony, who goes searching for the ""perfect"" wife and finds a wife that is perfect for him! Kate is not searching for a husband at all...she is mostly around to keep Anthony away from her sister Edwina. Soon Kate finds herself in love and betrothed to a man who thinks himself incapable of love...it is up to Kate to change his mind and convince him that love lasts forever!"
2,Liked the first chapters; only that,"The first chapters, with all the intelligent conversation and light-heartedness, promised a relaxing Sunday afternoon.Then it become predictable. This wasn't that bad, there are a lot of cliche romances that I liked. But after that, all the exaggerated emotional turmoil the hero is experiencing became laughable. Of course the heroine has an accident that makes him realize he's afraid to loose her. The chemistry was weak, the love scenes were warm and uninspiring at best..The book is not awful so it should have deserved one more star but it proved such a waste of time that I couldn't give it."
5,Just Perfect,"This book is very funny and amusing. I read it over and over again and I never got bored. Anthony Bridgerton is a perfect hero. He's handsome, a rake, but the most important thing is his love for his family.Another thing that I like from this book is the heroine. She's not perfectly gorgeous.. and I really appreciate Ms. Quinn for creating a heroine that is not perfect in appearance, but perfect in mind and intelligent.I really loved the story line, where Anthony, who at first is interested with Kate's sister, finally realised (after a lot of accidents) that he loves and wants Kate instead. And to him, she's beautiful and perfect... how much more romantic can you get (sigh)You have to read this book to believe how romantic it is, and I can tell you that this is one of the best books I have ever read."
5,The Best of Julia Quinn,"Of all the Bridgerton books, I feel this is her best story. Kate is not only smart but funny, sensitive and somehow more relatable with her fear of storms (I also have a fear of storms).I so enjoyed that Anthony didn't just ""get over"" his fear of bees, or his belief that he would die early (as did his father, uncle, etc.), just because the story was coming to an end.The story moved along at a good pace and the character development wasn't so over the top that it wasn't believable.A truly enjoyable story!"
1,"Cheap, don't waste your money","This toy as others have said does not work well and falls apart easily. It was a pain to put together, the cars fly off the track until they don't run on the track at all anymore and so, now my son only plays with the cars and the track is dismantled under the futon in our basement and who knows where all the cardboard peices(that are cute) but don't stay on the track are. I was VERY disappointed in this toy and wish I had known more about it before I purchased it. Don't waste your money on this!"
3,Try Something Else,"My son got this for Christmas and he was very excited. The assembly was easy enough, but the cardboard cut-outs would not stay up. It was also difficult to keep the braids under the cars in the right position so the cars would even go. I'd try another track before I wasted money on this one!"
3,The last warrior,"I thought the book is very interesting. I am not very far in the book , but it starts off good. It is about a young boy who is in the middle of his warrior training when his tribe gets shipped out and put in a camp. I suggest that anyone who likes books about history should read this"
1,A truly distasteful book,"Unfortunately, this book came prepacked with a DVD of Sideways. Upon reading it, I realized why it was included gratis. The author is almost always negative about the quality of the wine she evaluates, and is equally dismissive of some of the up-and-coming appellations both in North America and worldwide. In addition, the lion's share of recommendations seem to be chosen with price as the primary criterion, resulting in a litany of mediocre, mass-produced wines. With a little digging, it is easy (and rewarding) to find interesting and very good wines on a budget. If this were my introduction to wine, I would be driven away. The constant negativity and unimaginative recommendations make me question if the author really likes wine, or if this book is just riding a trend."
3,Tony Hawk 4,"Well, I can't say I didn't like it, and I can't say I'm too crazy about it. Some of the goals are a too hard.Sometimes finding S-K-A-T-E is pretty hard in these huge levels.Sometimes getting C-O-M-B-O is hard.Skitching gives you a ton of speed, so in levels with cars, you really don't have to worry about speed if you're racing a friend. Unless he can skitch."
2,This follow-up to Darna Mana Hai is equally insipid and scare-less,"I rented both ""Darna Mana Hai"" and ""Darna Zaroori Hai"" since I typically enjoy horror anthologies. Unfortunately, both movies are lackluster attempts at horror. Darna Zaroori Hai tries to be different than its predecessor in having the various stories directed by different directors. This is no help as the stories themselves lack focus and creativity, and most significantly for a horror movie, lack the ability to scare.Even the big name stars like Amitabh Bachchan, Anil Kapoor, and other familiar names like Arjun Rampal and Bipasha Basu cannot elevate this insipid horror drama. In fact, some of the stories are not even strictly horror but more of thrillers, and bad ones at that.If you like horror anthologies, I'd recommend Asian anthologies such as:3 Extremes3 Extremes IIBangkok Haunted"
1,Not what I thought for the price I paid.,"I had bought this product because the last gamecube i had bought off ebay was missing a cord, so I was hoping that I would be able to throw away the old one and use this one. This one, on the posting said used like new. So I was all for it. I ordered it, it took a little while for it to ship. When I got the product it did not come with any cords for it. This product is not used like new. There are some minor marks on it."
4,Totally Awesome!!!!!!!!!!,"The Nintendo Gamecube Platinum system is a game console like no other, it has the right to be #1. The reason I liked this system so much is because of its portability, I dont know the exact measures but look at a Gamecube package and the size that it shows on the front is it's actual size, small huh?! This game console also has a variety of games featuring a lovable character from the earlier Nintendo brand consoles, Mario! The Gamecube controller is a better than the PS2 controller, and a lot better than the XBox controller, those two system's controller have so many knobs and buttons!Another thing I enjoyed is the color of the platinum system,once you friends come over theyll be blinded by the great platinum color! Once you get a Nintendo Platinum Gamecube you'll forget about that PS2 you saw at Wal-Mart. I'd definitely recommend Gamecube to any gamer in this world."
5,This is one rugged little toy,"It has power, great games, neat controllers and of course the best first party titles. You can't go worng buying a Gamecube. The whole setup is phat and everyone I have shown in my family are buying one or already has. Alot of people say it's for kids where do you get that information???. It has better m rated games then any other console out their. Ever since I bought mine the other two console have seen alot of dust. If you have a whole team of friends and want some sweet game sbuy the Gamecube because you can get upto 16 players on some racing games and talk about sweet fun. When going down the mountain with 16 other people it is so cool and wicked easy to do. All you have to do is buy 1080 Avalanche a internet connector for the Gamecube and phone line. Hook it up and select the option for online multiplayer and you will be connected to the internet and ready to race against everyone else."
1,Get a PS2,"Want a good system? Then dont get a GC. Get a PS2. In fact dont just get a PS2. No, get anything you want except for GC. GC is horrible."
4,not good review just my opinion,well this review isnt very helpful because im just gonna tell you what i think about the graphics and games.First the graphics they might not be the best but i really love them they're just really giddy 3cspecially in the mario games I like the games cause new ones come out like every 2 months and it has mario games i love the gamecube in many other ways but im not going to explian. Im planiing on selling my gameboy advance sp to get a gamecube to memory cards for it four controllers and the gameboy advance game player. Anyway the gamecube is a great console buy it. only hundred bucks same price as a new gameboy advance sp. If you want to play GBA games then just buy that player thingy also. I think that the graphics would be much better on the gamecube then on the sp.
3,Teen's Birthday Wish,"My son had been asking for this Nintindo Gamecube for his 16th birthday. I looked everywhere. Nowhere else could I find it, not to mention the reasonable price. I do wish that an option to ship overnight would have been available. We received everything, including the game control, in excellent shape."
4,Gamecube is awesome,I like gamecube and Playstation2 just the same and they both have great games so either buy a PLaystation2 or a gamecube or just buy both because they are both great systems.Video games are basicly my passion and i love video games. I play them every day for hours upon hours.
4,One for One who wants One,"Gamecube was quuite depressing to me to concede the fact that it doesn't play DVD's or other broadband functions but the main graphics are pure genius. In a game such as waverace and Super Mario Sunshine the water realism is so unbelievable it looks actually real. i's size as others have said sets it apart from the other systems and the mini-disks were a new hip idea and you could tell thatnintendo was going at size. Another dissapointment though are the games. Though Mario is simply classic as well as all the other nintendo characters I was hoping Nintendo would go above and beond for the games. All in all its a nice system woth amazing graphics and size that makes the others look hunky and is worth buying for anyone who likes Ninteno. my ratings were necassary, one star off for broadband and another for games. Luxembugh ratings son't lie for this masterpiece."
4,buy this system,you have to buy a gamecube or an xbox! Man don't you think it would be cool if they were to make a grand theft auto series for gamecube and xbox only. i mean the only good thing about the ps2 is the grand theft auto games and the dvd player.if you have a ps2 take a good hard look at the graphics now tell me what you see block block block.now take a look at the gamecube and xbox graphics what do you see smooth and lifelike graphics thats how a game system should be.now don't waste your time playin tha ps2.go out and buy yourself a gamecube or xbox.p.s. play before you buy.
5,Gamecube,The Gamecube arrived in excellent condition and is being played continually. Was packaged very well to avoid breakage. Was very pleased with the shipment and the product.
3,the kid liked his christmas present,"I don't know how it works or even what it looks like, all I know is that the kid liked it and still does."
4,Here's what you're missing,"OK, there may not be enough games for this great console but the ones here are definitely worth it. Besides, Zelda, Mario and Pikmin series the console has the stellar Metroid, Rogue Squadron and Resident Evil games exclusively on the console (Resident Evil 4 was recently released on PS2 but the Cube version blows it out of the water graphics-wise.)The console itself and its discs are really cool looking and easy to carry around.Now the console lacks in high caliber fighting games (only Soul Calibur 2) and online play (only Phantasy Star)If you're a serious gamer you'll buy this console, a PS2 and Xbox. Gamecube has great exclusives that every gamer should play and is worth your money and time.On a side note: if u wanna hook this up to component cables for a better image, you'll probably have to look somewhere else as these newer models don't come with the multi out video output required to pump up progressive scan mode. Lame!"
5,NINTENDO MAGIC,NINTENDO HAS DONE IT AGAIN!WHO CARES IF YOU CANT PLAY DVDS ONIT?IT HAS THE BEST GAMES BY FAR. ITS BETTER THAN PS2 AND DEFINITELY BETTER THAN THE PITIFUL XBOX.TRY THESE WONDERFUL GAMES1.SONIC2.SMASH BROS.3.SUPER MONKEY BALL 24.STAR FOX(WHEN IT COMES OUT ON SEPT.14)5.CAPCOM VS SNK 2 EO (WHEN IT COMES OUT)6.MARIO SUNSHINEI HOPE YOU BUY A GAMECUBE AND NOT AN XBOX!
4,A great system but not perfect.,The Game Cube finally arrived in late 2001.I bought one in January with Super Smash Bros. Melee and Luigis Mansion.Both were great games but I liked Super Smash Bros more because its a little more fun.As for the Game Cube itself it has some really great games but is missing a classic around the same lines as Super Mario 64 and Super Mario World.Some games come close like Sonic Adventure DX and Super Mario Sunshine but none match the same amount of excellence as them.I still think it has better games than the X Box though and the Game Boy Player is an excellent accesory.Hopefully they will make another game like Super Mario 64 sometime soon but until then Im still busy with the games I already have.
1,Very disappointed,The picture shows the game console with all the equipment but I only received the game console itself. It didn't even come with at least a plug adapter to plug it in. Now I have to spend more money buying the rest of the equipment separately. The picture is VERY misleading. If you're looking for something with everything included buy elsewhere.
1,Bad expirence,"Alright so i bought the gamecube and what i got in the mail was a scratched up gamecube WITHOUT THE CABLES TO PLAY THE DAMN THING, no i have to order the cables because the customer service wont answer my phone calls"
1,Gamecube sucks don't buy!,"Nintendo is turning crap, the only good consoles of all time would be the NES and the SNES. Don't buy."
1,Dont Buy a Gamecube!!! READ THIS!!!,The Gamecube is not a good system WHY???? I Will tell you why It has good Graphics But nothing compared to Xbox Second cant use Dvds 3rd you need to buy expensive memory cards 4 really little games and Most of em are classic 5 cant go to internet. If you want a good system get an XBOX
4,gamecube is great just like the other systems,"i own an xbox and soon ill own a gamecube. ive also played PS2. they are all great systems! game cube is cheap, small, compact, classic and great games. xbox, has a built in hardrive, most powerful, and best fps game ever, HALO. the PS2 is good because of GTA. and also it has wie variety of games. My favorite of all three-GAMCUBE, because of its size and my favorite games (Mario Party 4, ZELDA comin out in march, metroid, SUPER MARIO!, and way more good games). so if you want a good system, it doesn't really matter, so chose the one that has the games you would like best(oh yeah and the controller size and shapes are different, so see which one you like best and buy it!!)"
1,Not so good,"The picture attached to this ad was deceptive. The item is clearly visible with a controller, A/V linkup, and a power cord, non of which was included. All I got was a box, which is very unusable without the other pieces of equipment."
5,SHUT UP JONNOTLORDOFTHERING!,THIS SYSTEM rules.LEARN HOW TO SPELL YOU FOOL!!! SDLKFJ;LAKSDFJ!!! THAT IS WHAT I THINK YOUR TYPING YOU PIECE OF CRAP!VIVA LA GAMECUBE
1,misleading,Disappointment because the picture shows the cords and controller the unit I received looks kind of beat up and has no controller or cords so now I have no clue if it even works and I won't be able to find out until I get all the cords and controllers.
2,wheres the memory card!,i enjoy playing the gamecube console but you gotta have a memory card and if its advertised with the system it should arrive with the system
4,COLORS,DUDE I GOT A INDIGO ONE IT STINKS I'M SELLING MINE TO GET A PLATINUM ONE AND PLATINUMS NICE BUT BLACK ROCKS BUT I MEAN IT'S SO SMOOTH LOOKING BUT I'M STILL GETTING PLATINUM. I LIKE GAMECUBEFOR THE SOND SYSTEM AND THE GRAPHICS RULE BUT THE GAMES ARN'T THAT GOOD AND DON'T COME OUT AS FAST ON THE GAMECUBE SO CHOOSE CAREFULLY ON THE COLOR YOU GET AND GET A GAMECUBE FOR YOUR B-DAY AND A PS2 FOR CHRISTMAS AND DON'T BUY BUNDLES THEY RIP YOU OFF I DID THE MATH!! BYE
2,Very Dissapointing... has smallest amount of games,When I first heard about Gamecube it sounded as if it would have the best graphics and games. It has definitely not lived up to that. Now I know the reason why it is 50 dollars less than PS2 and XBOX. Do not waist your money on a system with barely any games and choppy graphics.P.S. Their are no games over the teen rated level.
5,Super system and grat value.,"Wow! Gamecube is the bomb! Some people says that gamecube games are for babies. But I don't agree with that. They probaly didn't play one of the awsome things like Perfect Dark or Super Smash Bros. Melee. Besides it's educational value, I think this system is the best. But, there is one thing I don't like about gamecube. Sometimes it freeze up. But, at least it doesn';t freeze as much as XBox. Also, the system is very portable, you can carry it almost anywhere. This system is also very very cheap unlike XBox it only costs $150. I recommend this system to EVERYONE!"
4,"Awesome, but no online games","I owned the GC for 2 years and I didn't have any problems with it. Some of my friends said that it wasn't good because it hadn't online games. Unfortunately he was right, but we live in a world that most people has computers with internet. And most online games for PC are way better than XBox Live. Get over it. Only kids games? That's not true there's probaly about 10 rated M titles and about 50 or more rated T titles that re worth buying I have a PS2 and it's only better because it has a DVD player. GC has much better games than XBox or PS2 that are worth buying. And now for that price, you must be really not smart for saying GC is a inferior system."
4,more info,I did not realize it would not come with the connecters. The explanation of the product for sales should have said the wires weren't included.
2,Chewed On,"It worked, but it was kinda busted, controller looked like it was chewed on before it was sent to me. Not what I'd consider ""good"" condition, more like ""somewhat acceptable""."
1,ITS....DYING,okay i like nintendo but its just gettin old i mean at E3 they showed a new game called DDR well its new because it has mario in it they copy great games and turns them into crappy versions.But anyways the game cube is okay it just needs to be more less childish.
1,Rather watch grass grow,worst system ever!!! my little brother bought this in '03 and even he hated it Gamecube have tooooooooo many mario games and too little good games. the only game considering is resident evil 4 which is coming to the ps2 later this year. get Xbox or ps2 instead of this
1,Compairing this to a PC...,"This is an ok system with...1-2 good games. Compairing this to the PC, this doesn't have a chance. I rather choose a xbox or a ps2 over this system. If you want to be a serious gamer, get counter-strike, Quake 3, or Half-life 2 for the almighty PC."
2,"I love Nintendo, not the Gamecube","I got this machine awhile ago, and at first I loved it. I have never owned a system besides Nintendo, and Nintendo has never let me down. Unfortunaly, the Nintendo Gamecube is a huge disapointment.Pros-1.Small and Light2.Comes with a controller3.Plays Mario gamesCons-1.Most of the time the disc can't be read2.With some of the games, the grahics are good, some games have terrible graphics3.games range from $9.99- $49.99 (not really a bad thing, but usually the cheaper games, the least quality games They are making it obvious)4.Makes a very loud noise when turned on5.Many wiresI hope this review helps...don't get your hopes up"
5,One of the best gaming consoles for all ages,"I've seen many reviews about Gamecube and how it's aimed toward younger kids. Well, I've got news for them: I'm over the age of thriteen, and I love my GC!It's got awesome games, and the controllers are actually small and decent, not like Xbox's huge controllers. I love the way the buttons are set up. They're easy to press and my hands don't get tired. The graphics are good, too!A console for kids? Not in the slightest. This gaming machine has it all: sports and everything. All of my friends have one, and we're ALL over 13, FYI. It's conveniently small, so it's easy to take places.I'm so glad that Nintendo decided to go with disks.Please buy a Gamecube or a PS2! (Just stay away from the Xbox...stay far, far away... it's Microsoft's attempt at being cool and it's not working out:)"
5,THIS THING ROCKS,"You havn't played games intill you have played this. this is the greatest system ever. ... this has over 200 games in its library, which few people know. this is the best system for grahics you will ever i repeat ever have the pleasure of lieing eyes on. this system is highly recommened to a true gamerSO PLAY ON GAMERS!!!!!!!"
5,Gamecube console Platnum,Bought as a gift for a gamimg enthusist. They really loved it! So if you Like games I highly recommend it!
5,Its to awesome,"(From a 14 year old). When I first heard about the gamecube and saw screenshots of the games like smash bros and luigis mansion I wanted a gamecube so freaken badly. I had to wait forever to play the system. My friend got one and I played some games on it. After that I really wanted one for christmas. So I got it. This system is so cool. Its got the best games like Smash bros, luigis mansion, pikmin, eternal darkness, spider man, James bond nightfire, mario sunshine, starfox, the resident evil games, metroid prime, and believe me it will have lots of other great games. THIS ISNT A KIDDIE SYSTEM. It has a great selection of games for all ages. The controller is the best. The graphics are awesome. Nintendo is the best at games and systems. I think the ps2 is good but gamecube is alot better. I hate the xbox because it has sucky games. Xbox has no good games. Get a gamecube."
2,Bad Even for a Console Port,"Bad even for a console port. The gameplay is uninspiring and level design makes extensive use of invisible walls, sudden barriers that magically appear to prevent backtracking, and really dumb AI.IF you have a joystick, this game will assume it is a gamepad and use it for input over the mouse, which will lead to issues navigating menus. You will have to disable or disconnect the joystick.Not quite worth buying, you can do better."
2,Unplayable on PC,"I though the label ""games for windows"" meant something. Guess MS will put there name on anything.There is a reason this game is selling used for $[...]. It's unplayable due to the horrable job Capcom did with porting the controls and the mind numbing lag that makes playing it on hard a waste of time.Next time someone wants to port a so so Xbox game on to the PC I think they should have to prove they played it through them selves first."
5,roswell is awsome,"I think this cd is totally hot>Because it has hot artists on it and,because i love didos here with meand,Sense fields save your self. The television show it totally hot.so i think if you want cool tunes .This cd is difineitly it and,.Watch the show Tuesdays at 9:oo pm on upn!!!!!!"
3,The one thing you can say about Roswell....,"At least the music was always pretty good, too bad I can't say the same about the show."
1,Roswell (Original Television Soundtrack),"I do not like this CD.First of all, I can't even get to the CD to play the tunes. All I get are bits and pieces of songs and the screensaver information takes up all the viewing space on my computer so I can't do any work if I do want to hear whatever song I am able to access. I was only once able to access the songs to play like a regular CD does, but I have been unable to do so since that one time. I would never buy such a CD again."
2,Dissapointed,Read the review s before buying and strongly considered not getting. Thought about the mini horses but their manes weren't brushable. I think my niece likes but not big enough to have good play. The wings are cool bit better in the pictures. :-(
2,Not like the picture!,"The photos on the box and in the product description show a horse with 2 sets of wings-there is only one set of wings. It doesn't look the same, and I didn't like it as much. Plus, I dropped it from a height of 4ft onto a carpeted floor and it's leg snapped off! Thankfully, it was easily glued back on, but I wouldn't recommend it for children. I bought it for display only; as well as the other 3 in the set. Only the purple one came with the double wings-and it was in a fancy box with a feathery handle: this was in a simple package. Did they change production somewhere along the way? Very disappointed."
4,great message - very clear,great book about accepting different friends and friends of color.the message is very clear - my son got it first read. (5yrs old).but because he understood the message so well the first time round -he doesn't want to read it again.
4,A good alternative to M.L.B. baseball games...,"I have read the various opinions expressed in the reviews. The key for me in buying NCAA games has always been the fictional players. I am one of those gamers who always needs the updated rosters that each new game provides. However, with the NCAA games this is not necessary and I like that option. I have also heard the complaints about the new throwing and batting controls but rest assured that you have the option of using the classic M.V.P. controls. The lack of home parks for many of the schools shows me that perhaps this was put together in a hurry. When you consider that NCAA football has realistic looking stadiums for all of the schools one would think that would have been possible for this game as well. Having said that, this continues the great tradition of M.V.P. baseball and with the fictional rosters I won't feel the need to buy an updated version every year. GO BLUE!"
5,its ok,"If you are a fan or were a fan of the ea sports mvp series then this is a great game. Excluding the fireworks when you hit a homerun and the monsterous homeruns its good. I have no idea why they deided to get rid of the series but since they did that plan b which is considered this is a great game. Personally, I think that creating your own ballpark and university is the best part. CREATIVITY! Overall, I say it is a must buy."
4,Happy with my HP C1580,"Bought this PCS to replace the HP 750xi that had bit the dust after 6+ years of service. Stayed with HP because of the reputation and the good years I'd had from the 750xi. The HP C1580 was very easy to install and set up. Had it up in no time. The quality of the printing and copying works great for me. I liked the ease of the picture printing, the picture quality was satisfactory. The scanning process seems a little more complicated that my previous machine. The noice it makes while preparing itself to print is a little obnoxious though."
1,Disaster,"I have owned this printer for over 2 years. And I used it only occasionally. Initially I liked the outlook, printing quality, and features. However, as many other users already pointed, it takes so long to warm up or to shut down, and it keeps saying ""ink cartridges outdated"". I had to replace ALL SIX cartridges THREE times with authentic products from HP, but eventually it still failed. Now it won't start to work, nor can I turn it off unless I unplug it. It became a total waste of money and time."
2,Ok printer,"Pros: Good print qualityCons: Slow scan speed, not great scan quality. Internet connection would fail every day and require restarting the printer by unplugging it. Stopped turning on after 2 years - granted that's not short, but I expect my printer to last more than two years."
1,Horrible Software and Support,"After using the Printer, which is a nice unit, I had numerous Software related functions that did not work on the Printer. I called HP for some help but found their Tech Support to one of the worst.I spoke with two (2) different techs who could not solve the problem and told me to contact Microsoft.I spoke to Dell and Microsoft who both spent time trying to solve the problem and both agreed that the problem was strictly an HP problem.I never solved the problem and returned the Printer to Amazon for credit.I am now using a Dell printer with no problems."
1,Nothing but issues,I have had so many problems with this machine. The main issue is that it keeps saying there is not any yellow ink in the printer but I have changed the yellow ink several times with an OEM cartridge and it stil states that there is not yellow ink. It's ridiculous!
1,WARNING HP C5180: A Disposable Printer HP After 13 Months,"I am a college student and use it for printing papers mainly black ink, but occasionally use it for color projects. Not only is the 5180 a noisy, slow, piece of trash, HP customer service is just as bad.This unit is disgracefully known for ink system failures (google it and read troubleshooting) around 2,000 pages printed or about one year of use. Do not call HP for help after warranty expires; their response or solution is: we can sell you another one for 199.95, other than that, there is nothing we can do for you.No, I did not leave color ink cartridges empty, not even for one day. Yellow was the first to go, and then after replacing it, this piece of garbage would not recognize the new cartridge. Afer re-install NOTHING, then the dreaded INK SYSTEM FAILURE.Do not even consider a master reset; it DOES NOT work. Nothing will work but replacing it with an EPSON or CANON."
4,recommended it to my mom,"I've had this All-in-One for about a month. It's a great tool to have at home for casual use. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the photo quality is not quite as perfect as commercial prints, but it is good. (Also, I don't have the world's greatest camera, so I'm sure that's part of it.) I recommended it to my mom because of it's quality and ease of use. I think it's a good buy."
4,Just what we were looking for,"We were in the market for a floor lamp that could be used as the primary light in the room but also could be used as a reading light. The capability of having 2 bulbs in the torchiere portion allowed us to provide decent illumination in the room using only this lamp. We positioned the lamp immediately behind the couch, which provided us with easy switching of the light, and the reading light is night enough to reach over the shoulder of the reader."
2,Low quality and poor fitting parts,"The lamp came poorly packaged in a Styrofoam shell (that crumbled everywhere) sandwiched between two sheets of cardboard. One page instruction sheet was adequate for assembly, but a problem quickly became apparent; the factory inserted threaded pieces that allow the lamp sections to screw together were inserted at angles preventing the body of the lamp from being screwed together fully. My black lamp has 1/2 inch steel bands showing between each segment. Not aligning properly also makes the lamp tilt in several directions so it looks more like a broken item than a new one. I may have missed this in the description, but the shades are opaque thin plastic, not glass, so I'm wondering how long they will last using standard incandescent bulbs.Stay away, or buy assembled so you know what you're getting. I am really close to tossing the whole cheap P.O.S. in the trash."
3,if you don't mind being illiterate...,"plenty of conversational language, but the cassette has to be listened to with the book to make sense (not good for the learn-in-your-car crowd). Also the WHOLE THING is done in phonetics; doesn't the author think we're smart enough to learn a new alphabet?"
2,"If you prefer feminism to mystery, this book is for you!","Can you believe the Christian Right is so upset with Kate Fansler (a leading feminist) that they kidnap her husband and inform Kate that the ransom is Kate must cause a notice to be printed in the public press that she has renounced feminism! Silly. The author has often ""pushed"" feminism in her novels, but not to this extent. The ostensible mystery is really no mystery at all. The author did much better with THE IMPERFECT SPY, THE JAMES JOYCE MURDERS, POETIC JUSTICE and IN THE LAST ANALYSIS. Those novels were each a 10! The author's prose is ALWAYS delicious and that was the saving grace on this novel (otherwise this novel would rate a 1 from me).I am giving this author up; if I want to read about feminism, there is enough non-fiction around."
4,WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth,"WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth is an extremely playable game. It has very realistic graphics, thousands of superstars and an interesting season mode. Wrestling fans everywhere should love it. 8/10"
4,"Can,t be much better","This game's graphics couldn't get closer to the real thing. The stoeylines are much better. This game has up to date rosters with superstars like Brock Lesnar and RVD. Possibly the Game's only setback is difficult CPU opponents. They were difficult for me. But, for new players they could cause problems. Other than that this game is great!"
5,Brilliant,"Budziszewski is a brilliant thinker and writer. He's a Christian, but he has been an atheist, so he understands the common objections to religion. This book is about moral law or natural law. It's the law written on every human heart. He outlines the common moral ground everyone has.While reading this ebook, I highlighted and made so many notes! This is such a gem."
5,What You Can't NOT Know,"This book is a perfect example of the best in critical thinking. Intelligent and well focused on what we need to know to be human, made in the image and likeness of God."
2,Dull drum,My grandson got this drum at my daughter's baby shower and he never really played with this - he is two now and I think my daughter finally put it away but it never held his attention as it was a somewhat boring toy and is not very interactive. I would not recommend unless you want a toy that will only be used a few times and for a very short period even with lots of parent participation to try to spark interest.
5,Outstanding reference book that even includes DATA!,"Three special inclusions make this book valuable to those interested in cross-cultural comparisons of life and belief: theoretical background of who has studied what in the past, charts and graphs to explain how peoples compare with each other, a CD of data to study and use yourself for other research ideas. A great combination of resources."
2,Long on Stats Short on Practicality,I agree with Michael that this book is probably more suitable for the academic than the practitioner. I found myself 'fast forwarding' to the conclusions of each study rather than digging into the stats!
5,For anyone who'se ever been addicted to the wrong guy...,I loved this book. This is a well and lyrically writen from the heart type of book about a talented young musician finding inner strength in herself and her music after the loss of her daughter.
3,Natalie is a jerk!,"I love Steve Hamilton's books and have read them all. But in this one Natalie is introduced again as Alex's girlfriend. What a waste! Alex doesnt deserve her! I am jealous!Seriously, Steve Hamilton writes one cool book. His descriptions are the best and you run for a blankie to finish the book.Alex is always (...) in trouble and this time he gets the stuffing kicked out of him = again. How that bullet doesnt blow up inside him is beyond me. I guess I keep reading to see when and if it ever does. In the meantime, give Alex a hug for me. This was a fast, exciting read. Lose the babe!!!!! Alex deserves better! :D"
1,DO NOT BUY,"I would have Amazon consider changing the features....because they are wrong. You cannot ""skitch on the back of a car"", THERE ARE NO CARS! you can't ""skate through traffic"", THERE IS NO TRAFFIC! You can't play multi-player online, because this is the PS1. I want a refund for this horrible and pitiful game, ... dollars spent is... dollars wasted on this game"
3,Okaaaay...,"It was basically just poetry. Which is good for me because I love poetry but if you don't, then don't read it. It also had a lot of difficult words and I hardly got the point of any of the poems. So I would say that if you want this book then you have to love poetry and be really smart with words."
5,very nice product,great for people who love to doodle and who enjoy reaching inside and having fun with your inner self
4,best game i have ever played,as soon as my friend first told me about this game i was excited to play it. once i got it and played it i became addicted. I played every single minute of my free time and when the time came for me to play the final boss and beat him i was the happiest i have ever been after beating a video game. this is a must buy and without question the best game i have ever played
5,This is by far the best game available now,"This game is the best game available now,for any system. All you people who diss it are either Cube-haters, stupid, or haven't played it. The sound track on this game is excellent. Especially the music when fighting Metroid Prime's first form, if you have a sub-woofer. The graphics are out of this world. They outperform any game on any console. I don'tknow how, but they do. The framerate runs at a dazzaling 60 frames per second, with no slowdown, ever. And there are no annoying loading and wait times during this game either. This game is the best game for the Gamecube, and Zelda will have to work extremely hrd if it want's to beat it. Don't miss this one. This game alone is worth the price of a Gamecube. It's like the best game from 3 years in the future fell through a time warp. Buy it now."
5,A Metroid Masterpiece,"Nintendo's Metroid Prime (MP) is an excellent addition to the Metroid family. Conrols for Samus, though not traditional FPS controls, work beutifully for MP. The areas and backgrounds look great, they show what the GC (GameCube) is capable of in its early goings. The character designs look great though some enemies lack some animations, (don't worry the untrained eye will never detect it and it takes nothing away from otherwise fabulous gameplay). If you are looking for a deep RPG type plot you will not find it in MP. The plot for Prime lets you know, for the most part, whats happening. But there is no great detail, which I belive leaves it wide open for a sequel. Basically you are on a strange planet known as Talon IV. While exploring different areas of Talon IV you are retrieving what was stolen from you, Samus's armor and abilities you also find some new ones along the way. All-in-all Nintendo's Metroid Prime is a great game and a MUST BUY! for GC owners."
4,Metroid Prime is an amazing game.,"The first time I saw this game I thought it would be boring but after I played it at wal-mart I thought it looked cool. I started researching it and I found lots of information, good and bad. But after a while I started to like it alot so I got it for thirty dollars. It's really fun. People are always complaining about the controls but that's just because they stink. I had no problem with the controls. I understand why this was 2002 game of the year. The music and sound is great. I really like the lock on feature. I can't understand why people complain about that. If somebody has a problem with a game why get it? From what I've heard Metroid Prime 2 is 4 player co-op and online compatible. Which is good. Metroid Prime is a great game and if your a Cube owner get this. I don't care if you don't like FPS games because this is more it's also an RPG. So if you want a challenging game and can't find one this is a great choice."
5,Exactly what I got,"An excellent game, despite running into the glitch where you can't get out of a room and having it freeze occasionally, but it's only a minor inconvenience."
5,"Cool Game, but not sure if it is better than Super Metroid","This game rocks. You get awsome extras like unlocking 4 image galleries. Beat Metroid Prime, link to fusion to get the fusion suit in Prime. Beat Fusion, link to Prime and you get to play the Original Metroid. Heres what I thought the game.Graphics 10/10 Excellent Graphics and area detailed.Sound 8/10 Great music exspecially in Magmoor Caverns.Game Play 9/10 Pretty cool game play. Tons of puzzles and awsome bosses. The only thing missing in the game should be Kraid. He would make a good edition to the game.Extras 10/10 What more could you ask for?Theres only one thing I don't get. Why every one says you hate where the save places are located. I mean really it's a good challenge. I thought that once, but I got threw it in a couple trys in the Phazon Mines. I didn't just quit. I kept at it. Well that's my review. Se Ya!"
2,Way to difficult and confusing,"After being told it was the best game ever, I bought this game and was very very disappointed. You walk around lost half the game, get an idea of what to do and where to go then get lost again for another 30 minutes. I am usually very good at harder more complex puzzling games, but this one just pushes the limit. 2 stars for graphics those were pretty good."
1,Tedious and easy,"This game is not challenging, especially if you've played any other first person shooter on another platform. It's a dull run-through of a pre-set path, where it's extremely difficult to find anything interesting to do.Wouldn't recommend it at all."
1,I hate it!,"I hate this game, it has 2 more parts and the story doesn't make sense, it's super hard! and makes you epileptic, because you don't know what to do!!"
4,not too bad,"the mats are just rubber mats, no big deal there, but the ram in the middle is nice. I like that they are american made, and my daughter loves that no vacuuming is going to be required, just shake them out. They arrived very quickly, two days before they were scheduled to arrive."
5,Love Hilliard!!!,"This is some of the best music I have heard in a long time. Hilliard reminds me a little bit of The Pixies, and maybe Franz Ferdinand, but really, they are in a category of their own. Great Indie Rock, full of energy - can't stop listening to the album! I especially liked the tracks ""Rotation"", ""Inside"" and the more melancholy ""Circles"" which concludes the CD. Producer Brian McTear has put out a lot of excellent music so far, and Inside/Out is no exception. Take a listen - you won't regret it..."
5,FANTASTIC JOYRIDE!!,Guide Me God is a fantastic joyride!! The voices like Sinead O'Connor and Natasha Atlas took me to another place which I hated leaving when the music stopped. I hear that Paul Van Dyk has done some amazing remixes - tell us more !!!!
5,Video review,I did a review on this monstrosity on my youtube page. This thing is amazing. Please remember this is a model and not a toy. That being said it's very durable and so detailed. Building this is a joy and you should have a few smaller ones under your belt before attempting this.[...] Here's the review.
3,"Suspenceful, intense reading, but a little too weird.","I believe the author is a good writer and that is what makes this a good book, but the content was a little uncomfortable to me. I'm not sure that I would like my daughter to read about vampires. It creeped me out to the point that I was scared and I am a fully grown adult."
2,Not what I expected!,I really don't like science-fiction books so this was not my type of book. I was expecting a romance between two people who shouldn't be together but there was a lot more to it than that. It had a really good plot and a good ending but like I said not my type of book.
1,Would you like some wine with this cheese?,"Most of Mary Downing Hahn's books are tailored for the intermediate reader and although they follow a formula are fairly good. This book is more for the high school crowd and is awful! It is predictable, the heroine is a winey, rude, immature 16 year old, who is ungrateful for everything and thinks everyone is against her. Maybe all 16 yr olds are like this, but I sure don't want to read about them. Of course the guest, Vincent, is a vampire, but even if he wasn't he reeks of pervert! Supposedly 30 years old and the 16 yr old is in LOVE with him! Ooogggy! Although I would normally recommed this author's books, I say stay away from this one. Go read All the Lovely Bones instead."
4,Vincent the Freak,I was so into the book I couldn't put it down. I thought something was strange about Vincent. I would never let a vampire take my life over. If he didn't want me to see my family I knew something was up. WAKE UP CYNDA!!!
4,Very good vampier story for beginers!,"I found this story very interesting and creative, the part I enjoyed the best was when everything in Cynda's world was changing, although it was a superb book, I found it quite predictable, with the way Vincent was acting towards Cynda and how she was infatuated with him. A great mysticle story for beginer vampier horror stories. Be warned once you pick it up you won't be able to put it down, trust me, I got detention because I couldn't put it down in class...hehe...english teachers are purly evil.....Well, as always, enjoy the book, very thrilling story!"
5,Los Angeles Magazine review,"""In the tradition of Southern writers from Faulkner to O'Connor...Nahai captivates, filling her stories with characters and multivoiced narratives that rival those of her earlier works."""
4,Great shoe,"This is a great 5"" pump. The only thing is they run a little small. I had to change a size 8 for a 9 but that's it. And Spiked Angel was wonderful with letting me exchange the shoes for the right size."
5,American victory at the most crucial time.,"What a reading delight this book is as the intriguing story virtually leaps from the pages. Some may remember the gravity for our young nation of the events leading up to the battle at New Orleans in early 1815. But for many it has been lost.Yet what a critical time it was for the American experiment in freedom and democracy. This book details in a fasinating way the background years and the intrigue surrounding negotiations to end the nation's war with England. The action then builds from late 1814 right up through the climax of the final battle. The reader will find himself unable to put this book down until the reading is finished. It's a great read, not only for the history buff but also for every patriotic American."
5,Best Melatonin,"I've tried a number of brands and this is most effective, likely because it is a capsule and not a tablet."
3,Good prayers but not a good balance,"The prayers in this book are, as the title suggests, specifically for women as illustrated by some of the titles: Bakerwoman God, Womb of God, Before Birth: A Waiting Prayer, For He who Would Marry a Childless Woman ... The collection includes Celtic prayers, prayers from other cultures, classical prayers from women saints, and contemporary feminist theologian prayers.While each of the prayers has sufficient quality to justify its inclusion, the collection is poorly balances ... only the Celtic and feminist prayers consistently fit into a whole. The classic prayers, especially, feel like foreign insertions to give lip service to tradition.As a resource to pull a few prayers from for special needs, this collection provides solid material but for a prayer book to represent the full range of feminine prayer needs, this book fails."
2,"Great magazine, if you ever receive it","I was very excited to subscribe to Scientific American Mind. As a psych professor, I found the articles to be accurate and accessible and a great way to learn more about areas outside my specialty. However it was many months before I received my first issue--and then I noticed that the mailing label stated a renewal date from the time I subscribed, meaning I would end up two issues short.I have e-mailed the magazine twice, including all identifying information. I received an automated ""thank you for message"" e-mail each time, but have never received a real response from a real person.I am so disappointed!Needless to say, I am very unlikely to renew my subscription."
4,Its a good read,"I first read this magazine about a year ago when I bought the subscription from my sister's fundraiser. Once the subscription ended, I had to renew it. The articles are a good read and would suit any person's likes."
3,Kind of boring with an occasional very important article.,"I got a year of this magazine but I don't really like it. I also ordered ""Psychology Today."" They are pretty much exactly the same. They quote university research projects that should be named ""Proving the Obvious."" Why are universities researching this rubbish? There are so many more important problems that the world could use some help with. What a waste of fine minds.UPDATE: Some of the more intuitive articles are life-changing though, like the recent one on ""frenemies"" and another one I read on parenting. So, I am glad that I get this magazine."
3,Not bad,"Some pretty good action sequences, kept me watching to the end. This anime has a fairly high production value and feels like a fully developed plot. It won't disappoint."
3,buen estampado pero..,"para ser una franela de 20$ la tela es muy delgada, en comparacion con otras franelas del mismo rango 100% algodon, el estampado es bueno pero la calidad de la franela no mucha"
4,Learning Curve for Access 2007,"Ordered this for a co-worker and found her grumbling when she tried to use it. Aparently there is a significant learning curve when going from the last version (office xp) to this one. She DID say, however, that she sees advantages and will stick with it."
3,Access Review,This product is overpriced for its use. It is rarely used in the school world. This product to most is hard to use and requires better HELP programs in the software.
3,"Some is great, some is so-so","I came to this album mostly as a Jason Isbell fan, after becoming a bit enamored with most of his ""Here we Rest"" album. I've listened to and liked some of the Truckers' work but never given a full album a listen. It's not surprising that I prefer the Isbell-led songs to the rest on this album but some of the songwriting is very lacking, some of the performances are lacking too. ""Where the Devil Don't Stay,"" ""Lookout Mountain,"" ""The Buford Stick,"" ""Never Gonna Change,"" and ""Goddamn Lonely Love"" make it worth the price of admission. The rest isn't all bad, but I'm not exactly impressed with it either."
2,not too good,I am not going to say much but that i wasn't satisfied with the music. He played other music that wasn't his and that's what did it. I don't recommend it to anyone else. Sorry.
1,GGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRR,"I hate the fact that Disney bought Prozzak, gives them a new name and then hides them in a closet for a million years. They were doing fine and then boof, they never record another album. And no, I don't consider ""Simon & Milo"" (note my sarcastic quotation marks) to be another album. It's one new song, which isn't up to their usual standards and the rest are taken from Hot Show and Saturday People. Buy Hot Show and Saturday People folks. Simon & Milo isn't worth your time. It's the Disnified version of something that kicked ass without their ""help"" (more sarcasm).I was a fan of Prozzak before they went and sold out, before they became Disney puppets. Eck. Just. Don't. Buy. This. CD. Buy the others two, much better value for your money.I think this turned into a long rant, but trust me on this one, buy the other two."
4,Go for the Original,"Wow. My best friend and I were very upset when we heard that our long time favorite Canadian pop group, Prozzak, had given themselves up to Disney as Simon&Milo.Yes, this is a good CD because these guys are amazing. It contains some of the originals off of Hot Show and Saturday People and the made for Disney track, Get a Clue.My suggestion to you is to ditch this marketing-for-America CD and go for the original Canadian good stuff. Buy the imports of Hot Show and Saturday People. You'll be getting more good songs and you'll start with Prozzak on the first day of their journey for true love.Get Hot Show because Ready Ready Set Go doesn't include such great songs as ""Tsunami"", ""Mediterranean Lady"" and ""Anna-Lisa"". Get Saturday People simply for ""Lonely American Nights"".Basically, go for the gold, people! Be a true Prozzak fan and no a pawn of Corporate America!~Faye."
5,Exactly what I thought it was,I love this product. Please note do not use too much or its too heavy and greasy. Just a small dime size for hair longer than shoulder length. Then it leaves your hair not frizzy and can style better.
5,Smooth as Silk,I bought this product to use on my natural hair when I twist it. I was not expecting the great results I received which were silky smooth twists and twist-outs. I love this leave-in conditioner and I will be repurchasing it in the future.
5,"So dang funny, I couldn't catch my breath!","What makes this book so great is its true! I wasn't born in Texas but got a copy of this terrific book and leave it in the ""bath"" for times when I need to study for a while. My wife asked what the heck I was doing, laughing so hard, with the door to the bathroom closed. She probably thinks I'm a little strange, but whats wrong with a little humor!We are planning to buy a dozen for Christmas. This is sure to become a best seller. It was worth the $15 just to spend a good hour laughing out loud. What a blast! Plus, you don't get that many books in full color for $15 these days.Hope you enjoy it as much as we have."
2,Texas deserves better,"Texas Kitsch, lowbrow, underwhelming, and a false document of ancestor encopresis.Page is definitely of German dissent or has a cloaca or Sirenomelia.But the Poncho Villia outhouse was pretty funny."
3,Love the show problem with 2nd disc,"When I first got my box set I had a problem with Disc 2 side 2. The dvd would pause every few seconds, making it unwatchable. It was very noticable in the boxing episode. I returned it and the new one I got does the same thing. Hope the entire run of the dvd sets are not like this, check yours!Someone please let me know if you have same problems."
3,Need a 7' ramp for minivans,"I purchased a 5' ramp, but it wasn't the correct length for using for my minivan, so I purchased a 7' ramp. The first one arrived damaged, so I was sent a new one. Thank you Amazon customer service for helping us get the correct undamaged ramp."
5,Renaissance Faire Addicts Take Note!,"If you are a Rennie and faire season is over and you are experiencing withdrawls, THIS CD IS A MUST!!!"
2,Inconsistent and Lacking,"I've been developing J2EE applications professionally for a few years and was really hoping this book would provide some insight. Although this book assumes at least intermediate experience with J2EE and java coding, the anti-patterns seemed obvious to me and most of my colleagues. His example of the ""monster servlet"" was probably the most ridiculous. Beware of developers who claim they learned a lot from this book - it's all elementary stuff. I fear anyone who thinks JDBC calls in your JSP page is best practice.I've got to agree with the bloke from Australia, the personal adventure stories got tiresome."
2,Really dispointed,"I am a regular visitor to theserverside web site, and really like the first two books(Mastering EJB II and EJB Design Pattern) promoted by them. But for this book, I am really dispointed.I totally agree with the previous reviewer, if you don't have that much to say, then make it shorter. To be fair, I think the topics regarding the memory leak and cache have its value, but it can be better written."
5,The Giant Golden Book of Elves and Fairies (A Golden Classic),"This book has been a favorite of mine since the 1950s. Garth William's illustrations never disappoint. and Jane Warner's selections are fun, poignant, and worth sharing with future generations.I did find the colors of the cover to have faded from the original!"
1,Horror stories disguised as children's stories,"This book includes a short story about fairies stealing a girl named Bridget for 7 years, letting her die of sorrow, and keeping her confined under-water in a lake. Both the story and the drawings are very scary to young ones, especially if they happen to be named Bridget."
1,How I spent my vacation,"There are two ways I can describe this book: as an assigned essay on ""How I Spent My Vacation,"" in which it might receive a passing grade in High School; or as a visit by your brother-in-law, the one you never really liked but tolerated for your sister's sake, who shares his superficial ideas as if they were deep insights. I suppose there are people who will voluntarily submit to either, but I'm not one of them. The author (he can only be called a writer in the most literal sense) has no insight to speak of, is manifestly incompetent at background research, and lacks any useful power of description. He really should look up the meanings of words like ""masquerade"" and ""circumvent"" before he uses them. . . The real mystery is how something like this ever gets published."
5,Perfect for what I needed!,"I'm very pleased with my purchase. After having seen a video with the ruler having been used, I had to have one."
1,TERRIBLE TURNS YELLOW,"I bought one of these stands and made a beautiful cake for my nieces wedding - used it only once, wanted to use it this year for brides who wanted cupcakes but IT HAS TURNED YELLOW! Wilton told me to soak it in a solution of dishwashing powder and bleach for a few hours and then scrub it. I soaked it for days and scrubbed it three times STILL YELLOW. Consider this stand disposable and buy it only if you want to use it very little and throw it away because that is what will happen."
3,Nice but...,"bought this hoping to use it for a party hoping to put a small one tier cake on top. but the person that made the cake said it would be too unstable because of the middle pole sticking out. i'm looking at pictures put up by reviewers with the cake on top, how did you guys do it? because when we tried, it was wobbly. please help! if i can troubleshoot this, it's a great product! any suggestions????"
4,SOS's own Movie Theme,"This cd kinda of caught me for a minute because it was SO DIFFERENT than anything I've ever heard. Very late 60's-Early 70's James Bond/ Action Movie type music. I dig it though. It's so engaging with the whole pop, bossa nova, & soul feel. Another great collection by a group that never disappoints!peace,gs08dew"
2,Disappointed!,"This CD is not like ANY of their previous releases, and I am a HUGE SOS fan. My advice is that you try to sample all the cuts from some source before you buy. Too many of the cuts are spacey and go nowhere. There are a few that start out like they might be OK and take you somewhere, but then they just seem to fade away. And I paid the import price to boot, yet."
3,Coloring By Numbers,"I never thought that I would rate a SOS cd this low. Some bands move forwards, some stick to the formula, some go sideways and tweak things a bit....but this cd is like a car spinning it's tires and not going too far. There are a few tracks that will have you wishing that the rest of the album was similar ['What Kind of Fool Are You?' & 'Where The Hell Did I Go Wrong?' spring to mind] but overall this one feels like they are running low on creativity. I would suggest this disc only to diehard SOS fans, others can stick with 'Shapes & Patterns' or 'Filth & Dreams'."
5,"Ted Johnson in Maryland, USA, loves this album!!!","This is it! The album from SOS that I have been waiting for since Kaleidescope World. Sure some of the albums since then have been nice, but nothing has captured the beauty, sound and feeling that is distinctly SOS - elegance with a touch of the harpsichord and harmonica. I play this CD at my desk at work and everyone comes over and asks me about the beautiful music. ""Where the hell did I go wrong"" deserves to be a number 1 hit in the US. Why doesn't their label see the jewel they have in their hand? Thank you Corinne, Paul, and Andy. Thank you."
3,These could have been so much better!,"The stories in these DVDs are our favorite classics which is why it gets 3 stars. The problem? Whoever put these together put no thought into them whatsoever! These would have been GREAT if they had put the stories in chronological order. It would have been so easy! Maybe the kids don't notice, but the parents who have to listen/watch repeatedly sure do. For example, the James video has several episodes mentioning James' problem with bootlaces before showing the episode with the bootlaces. Another problem with the James video - they had an excerpt of the James song in between episodes but did not play it at the end. Why wouldn't they play the James song on the James video?Overall, very disappointing that they did not put a little more effort into these DVDs (this includes the Gordon video which we also have). What a wasted opportunity!Can you tell I've watched too many Thomas videos???!!!"
4,Cinderella Revisited,"Cinderella without the fairy godmother. I enjoyed this book, there were moments of levity and sensuality all in good measure. It was a quick read, and you felt for Sophie. You also fell in love with the Bridgertons."
2,VBA Macros Run Terribly,"We use Excel for some in-house data entry and processing. Much of this was automated using VBA, which was programmed in previous versions of Excel. It was decided that we would go ahead and upgrade the machine used for this function to the newest version of Excel, so it would be ""future proofed"" for some time to come. Well, that was a mistake.Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that Microsoft would have changed so much in Excel, that the VBA macros would effectively be destroyed. Programs that use to take 2-5 seconds to run, now take minutes. It is a complete waste. I will have to spend many hours trying to figure out why the VBA code no longer functions as it did in previous versions of Excel."
1,save your money,"I've used Excel since the 80s, and through 2003 it was good. This version is horrible. The toolbars are unintuitive, the charting (never that great) is less flexible (or at least more confusing). It might be OK for new users, but it's a waste of time to relearn everything for existing users, and there's no productivity benefit. Ugh. Avoid upgrading at all costs."
1,Unused purchase,"My computer crashed, and I lost MS Word 2007. The product was not what I expected, and could not use it."
4,Super soft!,"Nice little sweater, but run small I'd say. My pooch is 21 pounds, and deep chested. I originally bought her a medium and it was too tight. I then ordered a large and it fits her really well. It's really soft, and very sweet. I recommend it - just make sure you get the right size."
1,"Love the music, but lousy vendor","The Waterboys never disappoint, but my puchase was a disaster. When it arrived the CD case was cracked and not sealed/wrapped. Looks like a used CD. I will never use this vendor again -- why should I with so many good vendors out there?"
4,Buy Hard Candy...,"Don't get me wrong by telling you to buy Hard Candy by Counting Crows. This is still a good cd, but it's a single, so there's not much to it. Big Yellow Taxi (track 2) is the hidden track on Hard Candy, so you're still getting the song Big Yellow Taxi. Big Yellow Taxi featuring Venessa Carlton is really much. In fact, I would probably think that it was just Counting Crows if I didn't know better. Hearing the live version of Hard Candy is nice, but it only has slight difference from the Hard Candy album version.The video... Have to say that I'm into music videos, and this one is just plain boring. It's just the band singing the song around coney island, with Vanessa carlton popping up here and there to sing her backgrounds. Then, every so often they show a clip from the movie 2 Weeks Notice (I'm guessing this song was on the movies soundtrack).On some CD singles, there's enough new stuff to make buying the cd worth it, but not this on. Just go and get Hard Candy instead."
1,The horror knows no bounds. . .,"Recently, I was trapped in a lobby where the video for this insipid remake would play about every 15 minutes. The only thing I can say is that seeing the video is worse than just hearing it, but I recommend neither. The performance lacks energy or heart. Rather, it takes a good, but not great, song from its original context and attempts to force it into a contrived updated scenario.The Counting Crows hover near the top of my all-time most disliked bands, but this video seems to be self-parody to the extreme. The vocalist sounds shrill and almost frantic in his attempts to instill some sort of important message here. This song only bolsters my conviction that there in the world of corporate music, image, not talent, makes or breaks a band. This is one taxi ride to avoid."
1,I wish I had kinder words,"With much anticipation I purchased this book prior to it's release. Having already owned most of the other books published by Mr. Schatz and even the odd print I felt that it was not much of a leap of faith. To say that the book is dissappointing is to say that ""The Care Bear Movie II: The New Generation"" was not a great movie. The book is simply horrible. Like the idea of remaking the Care Bear Movie II but in an unknown language with subtitles I wonder why it was done at all. I wish I had kinder words but the book leaves me with a real sense of bewilderment - Why? Why sooo bad? The dreadful composition. The alien color. The amount of work that is out of focus (which is not a skillful use of a technique but just a disaster)does not work for this subject matter. The idea was solid but the execution screams out that it was put together in one evening after a few beers."
5,Café Tacvba y sus 4 caminos,"Lo q mas me encanta de este grupo es su enfoque hacia lo autoctono, por el sentimiento local, por las raices (en este caso mexicanas)... por el ""de aqui"" tambien hay gente con sentimiento, preocupaciones y creatividad en busca de expresarla de una forma u otra...La unica vez q tuve la oportunidad de escucharlos (y verlos) en vivo fue en la Expo Hannover 2000 y a pesar de solo eramos 4 gatos, el grupo dio lo mejor de si, o sea, q tambien profesionalmente y no solo artisticamente es un grupo q se quiere y se le respeta...en mi humilde opinion creo q es un grupo q toda persona deberia escuchar y analizar (sin importar su procedencia geografica ni edad) y lo escribo en espanol porque esta es la lengua"
4,Welcome to Mr. Robinson's neighborhood,"The magic of Eddie Murphey's final season on SNL is captured on this best of 1983 tape... and when I say magic I mean Murphy truly went all out before departing from the show. You would have to see it to actually experience the magic that is Eddie Murphy on SNL. I don't want to give away any surprises, and believe me, if you've never seen it before then there are plenty of surprises. But obviously there's Mr. Robinson's neigborhood and Buckweet. No Gumbi on this one, but there is a really good sketch with James Belushi and Joe Piscapo. The star though is Murphy, doing an impersination of Michael Jackson that will have you laughing all night. The only reason I didn't give this one 5 stars is because they rolled the credits right in the middle of James Brown's Celebrity Hot Tub."
4,87 was a good year,"ahhh 1987, the show was finally comming in to it's own again,the cast was great the show was recovering from the bad period after crystal and short left and these are some quality sketches and some very funny moments even if it is just a random year. The true highlight here is hartman but all of the cast shines."
3,Dissappointing for a Shun,"Bought this and a 6"" paring knife at the same time. The paring knife is amazing, but this knife is only so-so. Doesn't seem to be all that sharp, although it is still a beautiful knife. Metal handle works well, an nice surprise."
4,Well put together chaos...very danceable,"A sound very similar to the Faint but with a spoken word style of vocals and more visceral non-melodic, groove oriented material. It takes some listens in order to really hear what they're doing with the bass being the lead. Good music for me to just clear my mind and relax while also feeling a bit charged up."
5,A must have concert DVD,"Outstanding Rock/Stage performance. Waters did an excellent job of putting an ensemble of talented and complimentary musicians together for a momentous gathering with great music. With the exception of Van Morison and Cindy Lauper, the cameo musical quests did not detract from the great original score of The Wall. The DVD 5.1 re-mastered soundtrack sounded great and added to the nice visuals."
4,Very good,"I enjoyed it, but it was not as great as I expected. I was looking for more music and less theatrics. But it's very good."
5,Loved It,This is one of the best made Pink Floyd dvd's on the market and cannot be beat. Although it is in 480p the sound is incredible.
4,You are there!,"Puts perspective upon one of the many amazing events of our times. As a long-time 'listener' of Mr. Morrison and former purveyor of modern living through chemistry, the ""Comfortably Numb"" piece nearly sent me 'Jonesin'. I mean 'Moon Dance' was good, but....However, after a few 'rewinds', I thoroughly enjoyed Van and his gang of troubadours. A must see, gotta get it!"
4,nice,very satisfied with this dvd. arrived on time. the quality is good. it was a gift for my husband and he was very happy.
1,IT SUCKED!!,"I really hated it...Van Morrison really gaked out Comfortably Numb, ..what WAS Roger Waters thinking when he 'cast' this? The Scorpions and Bryan Adams weren't bad, but all in all... a thumbs down. Floyd was at their best when they were all together. No doubt about that."
4,(Mostly) Spectacular!,"Out of all of the ""The Wall"" concert DVDs I've examined, this one BY FAR surpasses the others as far as sound and video quality go. The only real downside is that they didn't have the children's choir for Another Brick In The Wall, which was one of my favorite parts. But all in all, this DVD plays a terrific tribute to one of the best concerts ever in my humble opinion, and no Pink Floyd / Roger Waters fan should be without it."
5,The Wall,For any Pink Floyd fans this is a must great visual effects fantastic music lots of other rock stars join in the fun
3,What you get for your money,"Excel is a perfect example of software attempting to be all things to all people. It does what I need it to do and a whole lot more besides. Because of that, I realize I am paying for ""a whole lot more"" even though I don't particularly want it. What I would like to see is software that will do basic stuff. It happens that I was more or less forced to use Excel because of files previously created with an earlier version of Excel."
3,Best for pre-k and pre-readers,"My 6-year-old, who LOVES pretty much any board, card or bingo game, really didn't care for this. I think it's better for younger kids who like the I Spy series of books and games and who don't yet read but are learning letters and beginning word sounds. Once you move on to being able to read, (and my kid does) this kind of game where you match letters to items that begin with that letter becomes too easy."
3,The Potty Book for boys.,"I agree with the other reviews that state that while this a very cute, durable, fun book with wonderful illustrations, it is also not very instructive. However, we read it with 'Max's Potty' and 'It's Potty Time' which both include wiping, flushing & hand-washing. As such, as a single stand-alone potty training guide, I would have to give The Potty Book 3 stars."
3,Doll is pointless,"the doll is so small that getting on the small toilet is beyond my 3 yr, old's skill level so he can't really get the point of helping the little guy go potty...."
3,"pleasant, but not all that helpful","This is a cheery poem about a boy named Henry who is learning to use the toilet. He uses a separate potty seat rather than a toilet insert, and the book uses the terms pee and poop. There were a couple of things I didn't like about the book -- in one picture Henry is brushing his teeth and has toothpaste squirted all over and a bowl of oatmeal on his head! This is distracting. In another picture urine is in a big puddle on the floor when Henry's had an accident. In yet another, Henry's pants are wet after he had another accident. I guess I feel I can reassure our toddler if there are accidents; I'd like the book to stay on message and show a positive and successful experience. Also, as in most other books of this genre, there is little show-or-tell about the actual anatomy or mechanics. This book isn't terrible and our son likes it, I just don't think it has helped much."
5,Great book!,My son enjoys Mom and Dad reading this book to him. He helps to lift the flaps on the pages. He is only 21 months so we are introducing the potty. This is a great book to start with introducing the potty and how to use it.
3,"Not bad, but not really good either.","I agree with another reviewer -- this book is OK, but it doesn't really seem to help my child feel more comfortable about what is supposed to happen with the toilet. Most of the book is devoted to the character's failures, not success. And having a whole page to guessing what the potty could be for (a fish bowl?) is just not helpful.I would recommend ""Sesame Beginnings: Potty Time!"" over this book."
5,Really helped,"This is the only book we bought about potty training for our little boy. He's now long since potty trained, at a relatively early age, and this book deserves some of the credit. First, it's very attractively written and illustrated; our little boy liked it and requested it frequently when we were going through potty training. Second, it actually seemed to help him think about what was going on in potty training. We had already started sitting him on the pot and asking if he needed to go, etc., before getting this book, and he was sort of at a progress plateau, but when we got this book, it did seem to make something click and I think he made more noticeable progress after that. A month or two after we got the book he was to the point where we could take off the diapers entirely (at home). He seemed to get a big kick out of ""Bye-bye pee! Bye-bye poop!"" As you can see, it speaks in honest terms about pee and poop but isn't unnecessarily scatalogical."
4,Served its purpose,We got this for our son and he seemed to like it. It covers a good amount of material but I would not call it straight forward instructions. It's a story about a boy and how he learns how to use the potty and so we used it to talk to our son about him using his potty chair.
2,no good,"On a friends recommendation I went with the Chaco's, but I am a flip flops guy when it comes to sandals so I opted for the heel-less Zong's, well they were awful, incredibly uncomfortable and the sizing is all wrong. The adjustments don't hold and your heel slips off the back. the sole is strong, that's about the only good thing here. They hurt my foot. If you have a wide foot and require an arch, then make sure if you buy, you go for a size up, if you are seriously considering these, but I wouldn't recommend them. Although it's my fault I ended up buying the heel-less, I'm not willing to write off Chaco's, I just wouldn't buy the Zong's ever again. I'm actually wanting to give them away right now they hurt so bad."
4,I enjoyed it,"A few color photos in the middle of some plants, buds and a few setups. Not really instructional (the color pics) but nice. The book has plenty of information and I enjoyed reading it. It has decent drawings of the different grow setups and information about nutrients, lights and security. Not my favorite by itself but its part of a collection of grow books that I have and it gave me enough information for me to feel good about buying it."
4,Great help for History,"The maps of countries change so much throughout history, making this book a must have for students of Greek history."
3,Another Bargain on Beatville,"The title of the record says it all. This album speaks at you, and guides the listener through a sublime post-punk record closer to Long Beach Dub All-Stars SO-Cal Sound. It has some seriously poppy elements, but they are carefully intertwined with a bit of reggae and some well-mixed and uniquely-pitched vocals. For a three-piece they lay the funk down pretty well, despite certain keyboard dissonance throughout the middle of the record. While this adds a very ambient texture to the record, it also muddles up the vocals a bit. Overall ""The Magic Is Over"" is an interesting excursion, with many a death reference, and even the band's epitaph's (clever) and faux post-mortem photos on the inside cover. Bargain Music is Matt Brein on Bass, Josh Fischel on vox piano and melodica, and Zach Goodin on guitars. ""The Magic Is Over"" is released their album on Beatville Records."
2,Poor Man's Creed,"After reading the reviews here, I thought this CDmight be cool, but I have to admit, I'm not overlyimpressed. There are some semi-memorable melodies,but there's not enough depth to keep me coming backto this CD. Parts of it sound WAY too close to Creed.Not every band can be original, but this sounds like300 other bands."
4,A Clash of Cultures,"The Spirit Catches and You Fall Down is the story of Lia Lee, a child born to Hmong immigrants. The Hmong people are very different from American's and a clash of cultures is inevitable. When Lia develops symptoms of epilepsy the American doctors prescribe a complicated mixture of medications. Lia's parents, unaware of the medical terminology and correlations, believe Lia's condition is caused by spirits. The lack of understanding, among both parties, leaves Lia tbrain-dead.The author presents Lia's family and the doctor's points of view in an unbiased manner. It is easy to see the situation from both perspectives. The book alternates between Lia's story and a history of the Hmong people. Richly detailed, the Hmong culture is full of rituals, strength and perseverance. At times the writing appears slow and repetitive. The history of the Hmong is interesting, but needs editing. Overall, I would rate this book a 3 out of 5."
5,"great book for anyone, not just medical professionals","What can I add to this after close to 300 reviews? Reading it as a fourth year medical student, I couldn't put this book down and read it until 4 am, which I haven't done this happily since ... I don't remember when. You can really tell it was labor of love, and that a lot of care and work into researching and writing of the book. As much as I found the background story of Hmong and Laos helpful in gaining a bigger perspective, it was less interesting than the gripping medical/social stories that were happening more currently (back then). It'll have a cherished spot on my bookshelf always!"
4,The Clash of Cultures,This is an extraordinary account of the Mhong culture with its beliefs and mores. Being uprooted and immigrating to the USA at the end of the Vietnam conflict truly changes these gentle agrarian people. Without the courtesy of interpreters the life of one Mhong child is direly affected when the beliefs of the Mhong conflict with Western medicine. A true tragedy in peaceful times!
3,"Good Story, Weird Writing",The story is good and I like the idea behind it but I feel that story has become more of an ethnography than a story. I understand that may be what it is. But it's hard to continue reading at some points.
5,"powerful, a must read for all doctors","this was an amazing book. she has capture the story so well, and you are left to make up your own mind on who's fault it is, if there is any. being a pediatrician, the story hits close to home, but i think it is a must for all provider, especially those who must interact with patients from a culture, that is not your own. a must read, you can finish it in one day, it is that engrosing."
3,great insight but...,"This books gives great insight into the hmong people, modern medical practices, and cultural clash. I am glad I read the book, but not sure I would call it a great read. It's kind of like reading a research paper. There is a ton of very detailed documentation of events that became monotonous and slightly predictable. While I enjoyed the underlying story a great deal, the minutia often seemed distracting from what could have been a good read."
4,Good reading with great historical and cultural info!,Become informed while you enjoy good writing. This book is uplifting in its literary style as it presents invaluable historical and cultural information about the Hmong who settled in the United States. The reader will be rewarded by gaining understanding and compassion toward the Hmong families and community.
5,My 14 year old talked me into reading this -,"I don't even know where my daughter got this book, Hope Was Here, but as soon as she finished it she told me, Mom, you've GOT to read this. Liz is a fairly typical 14 year old girl (if there is such a thing as typical), she's not political, she cares about clothes and friends, and she loved this book. I picked it up and couldn't put it down. It washed over me in waves - comfort, friendship, family love, poignancy, but yes, through it all, with hope. Hope's amazing attitude in the midst of so many hard things made it a pleasure to spend time with her, and made me more hopeful too. What a great book, I'm so glad my daughter found it!"
4,Endless Hope,"I would definitely recommend this book because, every night I would look forward to reading it. One night, I stayed up to ten o'clock reading because I kept turning the pages. In the story I connected to Hope the main character because, sometimes she thought that time would never pass. When she was waitressing, and she was in weeds (little help with a lot of hungry customers) she hopes that time will fly by. From this story, I learned that you could never know when your last moment will be, so enjoy your life to the fullest extent possible everyday."
5,A book you'll love,"""Hope was Here,"" was a great book!!! I loved it. In the book 16 year old Hope and her Aunt Addie move from Brooklyn N.Y to Muhoney WI. Where they meet G.T Stoop. G.t stoop is an owner of a Cafe who has lukimia. In this book ther is a little romance for Hope and her aunt Addie. Hope finds her self doing things that she never thought she would do in her life. She joins a campain to get G.T Stoop elected for mayor so that the evil Millstone can't get mayor for the 4th year running. I think this is really the best book I've ever read. It has humer,hope politics, diese, romance every thing. So I urge you to pick up the book today and read, you won't be disapointed."
2,zzzzz,"This was not a good book. I'm a college student studying middle level education, and I read a lot of YA lit. The book had no character development, it was predictable, and the plot is boring. The exact same thing happens in every chapter. I rarely review books, I don't even know what to say besides this was not easy to finish."
1,Hope Was Here,"The book is about a girl named Hope who gets a job as a waitress in Brooklyn as soon as she gets it she moves to Wisconsin. When she moves she gets a job in a restaurant called the Welcome Stairways.I think the book was so bad because it made no sense at all, if had more details it would still be bad. When read it I thought it was going to be good.I recommend it to an old person who cant read."
1,Don't even think bout buying this,"The man can't rap, can't produce, and can't write his own lyrics so you CAN'T buy his album..."
4,"Not a big Fan of Puffy, But...","""No Way Out"" is by no means a Classic. However, it's not complete bullsh*t like all Puffy's recent albums. Pretty good production, good collaborations, overall a decent cut. Don't assume this record is gonna sound like ""Forever"" or his other records, cuz it has a lot more originality and quality than the sh** he released under his P-Diddy alias."
1,Smell the Originallity,"Puff Daddy is back with No Way Out. His most original album to date. By taking other peoples' songs, he copies them and makes them to call his own. Puff Daddy completely kills Led Zepplin. I haven't seen this much talent and originally since Millie Vanillie. The saddest thing is people like this sh*t and buy it. No Way Out should really get -9 stars. If you plan to buy this album then you need a labotamy."
2,Needs a little pokin' with a stun gun,"I bought this CD used based on the hype I was hearing. I really didn't like it on first listen and only marginally better on the second. The redeeming qualities come on the few OK songs that include guest artists which also seem to be the songs that aren't limited to simply PD's poor homegenized unrealized lyrics. Now I'll confess I'm still wading at the shore of the rap/hop ocean of music out there, and though I may not love Digable Planets, or Fugees, etc. I can appreciate the talent and originality that went into those artists works, traits found lacking with NWO. Still, if his goal was fame(however limited) and fortune then this disc was a major success(for him at least). I however will turn my ears elsewhere."
1,Worst album of the year.,"Puff dud or poop diddy whatever his name is must really be desperate for some fast cash with the release of this garbage.What an opportunity to exploit his friends death and make some money by stealing the police song every breath you take and renaiming it ""ill be missing you"".Everybody knows that puff daddy was never really friends with biggie and used him only to make more money.P diddy was responsible for the deaths of 9 people for failing to do his job as an event promoter and he let his so called friend go to jail for him.People you must ask yourself if this is the type of of self centerd and greedy human being you would want to support with your money.This man has absolutely no talent as he steals other hits and calls them his own.To conclude,Im very surprised no one has sued p diddy for beat jacking and I would really give this cd 0 stars if I could.Have a nice day."
1,"Puff Daddy, could you have a more homosexual name?","Puff Daddy has only been able to stay on MTV as long as he has because of his capitolization of the Notorious BIG's death (rest assured I shed no tears over his death though). All of his songs are cheap covers of 80s pop drivel, which he somehow manages to make even worse. Anyone who enjoys this is either a masochist or a mental defective. He yells drivel in his albums with Mase hopping around in the background like a tame ape, slurring in his inimitable, unintelligable style. Puff Daddy also has an absurdly high opinion of himself, and his videos are the most egotistical pieces of garbage I've ever had the extreme displeasure to see."
1,Eeeeeew!,It seems that Puffy is only using a death to launch his career. This album does not have a very original sound. Many of these covers and twists come out sounding cheesy nd then overrused.
1,Complete dog excrement,"I'm not one of these people that is a hip hop purist and can't stand commercial rap-- but this is really really bad. The one strong track on this project is ""Victory"" featuring Busta Rhymes and the Notorious B.I.G.... this is one of the greatest and most well conceived tracks ever. I absolutely love it. From there, this album goes from bad to worse- Puffy is not only not a rapper (he's known as a producer trying to rap) but he's not really a producer either with most of the tracks being blatant rip offs of old school rap songs. This is one of those CDs that people will tease you for having in your collection."
3,"I sorta like Rap, I guess","Finally got a chance to listen to ths album. For me, the attraction of Hip-Hop is the beat, the funk, the tune. Seldom listen to what was being said. A few points about Sean Combs' album:1) The ways he recycle old tunes are just brilliant. He completely realised that there are potential of past hits that should be exploited, like squeezing a juiced grapefruit. I know of most of the songs he borrowed from, but the new twist really did magic. Just for that he deserves the respect.2) The lyrics, on the other hand, are complete bad. But who cares? The productions are great.3) Every joe blow can be marketed as long as you are black. Bad rapper like Puff Daddy and JayZ have no place behind the mic, but they are pulling in millions. Just to be fair, white rappers are equally marketable, but with a different packaging. Do I hear Vanilla Ice?4) Dr. Dre and Ice Cube is still the best."
1,PURE GARBAGE,"I would rather commit suicide than listen to this garbage.P.S. (I wanted to give the album no stars, but I didn't have that option)"
2,"If it weren't for the cameos, this album would really s***!","Instead, excellent performances from Biggie and Mase and decent showings by Busta, Foxy Brown and The Lox make this a 2-star album. Puff Daddy is so weak on most of the tracks that sometimes you don't even realize he's on the track. It seems somebody, be it Biggie or Ginuwine or whoever(!), steals the spotlight from Puffy in every track. When PD is all alone on a track, It bombs."
3,Crazy original,"To all you playa hattas out there. Puff is crazy, I mean who else do you know that can talk about God and sex and cuss words all in one line. I gotsa say some of the songs are sweet, but when it comes to being consistent with his views, he's all wacked. Are his songs tight, let's just say he doesn't make em tight, they were tight the day he snagged em. Still all in all album sounds good."
1,BORING TOO MUCH BAD WORDS,"This CD has to much bad words, repetion, bad singers, and trashy music, I defenently do not recomend it. It is also impossible to enjoy or dance to. It is only under satisfacory for kids ages 13-14. Any other age is either too boring and trashy or to unmature"
1,weak joint,"an album of nothing more than pop-rap commercialised bulls**t. the fact that so many pepole bought into the hype & mad this joint multiplatinum is a travesty. his lack of originality gets real boring,as does his shameless over-use of samples. this album only appeals to those trendy pop-music sheep. save your money and invest it in the roots ""illadelph halflife"",an album that is true and represents the real.one more thing....when you think of rap,if the image of sean ""puffy"" combs comes to your mind, think bigger(and better)."
1,"Can we say ""sellout""?","I'm sorry, but Puffy is a much better businessman than artist. With the possible exception of Victory, he has made no real music."
3,More ORIGINAL songs please......,"This rap is OK but the problem with Puff Daddy and his Bad Boy crew is that they keep ripping off other people's songs, songs that had already been big hits with other artists. ""Can't nobody hold me down"" is a remake of Matthew Wilder's ""break my stride."" ""I'll be missing you"" samples ""Every Breath you take"" by the Police. Meanwhile Biggie's ""Mo money mo problems"" is a remake of Diana Ross's ""I'm Coming out"" and his ""hypnotize"" is actually Herb Alpert's ""Rise"" with words added. All four of these re-made songs went to number one on the billboard pop music charts so apparently people actually dig this stuff. but if you want real rap get All Eyez on Me by 2pac or Doggystyle by Snoop Dogg or the Chronic.Any of these deliver more for your money than this."
1,No that good at all,"I like hip hop and well used samples with good lyrics and good rapping. However, Puff Daddy doesn't sample well and just cannot rap. His lyrics are written with feeling so i can sympathise with him but i feel that he himself is talentless. If you want proper uses of samples, check out DJ Shadow's work. If you want good rapping, check Wu-Tang, Dre, 2Pac etc. For good lyrics check Pink Floyd.I'm sorry if people don't agree with my opinion but I just don't think you need to be extremely clever to make money off The Police."
1,garbage,puff daddy is not a musician. anyone can take beats from other songs. its ok to do it to a certain extent but he does it on every song almost. bad boy is garbage
1,"A perfect example of a terrible ""rapper""","This album is the kind of product that makes people diss hip-hop. It's hard to call this a rap album, as it probably appeals to 13 year-old, female N Sync fans. Puff does not drop one good verse in this CD, and there is an overabundance of obvious samples. Lyrically, this CD is simply bad, although Biggie does have a few good rhymes here and there.Nevertheless, this is a mediocre album at best."
1,CAN'T YOU PUT 0 STARTS ON HERE?,"This CD is ROTTEN! I hate Puff Daddy. He is the worst thing to walk this earth. Please, don't EVER let this CD in your presence."
2,knight rider season 3,night rider 3 was ok except for disc 1a had problems couldn't watch it all the way .
2,knight Rider's down fall,"The Success Formal In Season Three Was Starting To Wind Down By This Time. The Story Lines Were Weak And Lack Action,Mainly Because The Show Was Limited ToProviding A fresh Idea.There Were Some Episodes That Stand Out Like K.a.r.r.AndThe Final Battle Between Golliath & Kitt.In My Opinion This Series Was A Ground Braking Science Fiction Show.Love Season's One And Two Dont Bother With Season 4"
1,Avoid this album,"This must have been the worst album released last year. The Lox have no talent at all. The only good song on this album is Money, Power, Respect because it had DMX in it. It sounds like they be mumbling when the rap. Why can an East Coast rapper put out a mediocre or sometimes sorry album and get props for it but a rapper from West Coast or Down South make a mediocre album(sometimes good albums) and everybody say he or she is sorry. What's wrong with this music industry."
5,Hot 2 Def,"..The Lox combine style, lyrics with substance and hot tracks to keep you movin'. Definitely a great CD ."
2,THIS LOX ALBUM IS JUNK !,THE LOX NOW ARE IMPROVED AND WITH A BETTER RAP FAMILY.THIS ALBUM IS WACK DON'T BUY IT.
2,Its sad,Its sad tha Lox had to deal with tha post biggie bad boy family I kno dey gots tha but P diddy or wateva his name is now ruins it. I knew backden tha Lox were tha future n a way to save rap from its state now. Buy We are tha streets its almost classic or check out tha solo albums.
1,disgust,"I was intrigued with the title, but understood nothing of the lyrics. As most of rap (hip hop) this is incredible garbage. only my opinion of course."
4,Bad Boy's Bad Boys,"Too many people judge this album by the horrible Puff Daddy laced ""If You Think I'm Jiggy"". However if you look beyond the charts and into the album songs like ""All For The Love"", ""The Heist"", ""B**ches From Eastwick"" show that the LOX actualy talk about something when they rap, unlike 80% of the artists on the Bad Boy label. Jason Phillips (aka Jadakiss) shows that he may be as underated as Puffy is overated. Of course there are definate blunders on the album such as ""If You Think I'm Jiggy"", ""Goin' Be Some Sh*t"" but overall the CD is a very good first major label album for this group of three young men straight outa Yonkers."
4,Night of the ripper,"Quick, easy read. Great paced book with obvious historical research about the ripper cases. Ending was very tidy so be prepared if that's not your thing."
2,ehhh,"I tried these one time in my booda dome....they dont stay in place and I think they are just a hassle..no liners for me, they just dont seem like the right fit even though i do have the same booda as pictured on the package."
4,Works Perfectly with the large dome litter box.,"These litter liners are great, they fit perfectly with the large dome litter box. Makes cleanup a breeze, not to mention, they are reasonably priced"
4,Text Book,"The delivery was prompt, and the book is in usable condition. The only complaint is that the book had a sticky substance on the cover that I had to put tape over."
5,RATING THE GRATING!,"This is a very fine grater for the price. It gets the job done without fancy frills. Its sturdy and doesn't tip or move when using it. Its a good size so whatever the item you need to have grated, this grater can stand up to it. Recommend this product for anyone who loves efficiency in the kitchen."
2,Too big...,"...and boxy, it looks like a better idea online, as I have almost nowhere to store it..but it does work like my old one, only sharper."
1,CHEAPLY MADE,New Airform EVA Carrying Case for Nintendo Ds Lite NDS LiteThis product did not last 30 minutes. The zipper on the pouch broke the first time we tried to zip it up. It was a great dissapointment for my daughter. DO NOT buy this product.
2,Problems,"I purchased this unit in December, 2002. I really enjoyed it for the first two months and then it would no longer read DVD's. It would read a CD or an MP3-CD only. It's currently at an authorized service center. They believe it is an allignment or decoding problem. Thankfully, it's under warranty. Buy with caution."
4,If You Truly Enjoy Bleach...,"... then you really ought to buy this disc. The great thing about this product is the selection and arrangement of tracks. Normal game/animated show OSTs have only the OST version of songs. By my preference, however, this contains the full version of the various songs and quirps in the series. While not all-inclusive, it does contain a vast arrangment that will surely entertain every different kind of Bleach fan.You will still be left to desire a little bit more, however, as only OST versions of the opening/closings are recorded, and then not every one of them is on this disc.I bought this because I am a hard-core Bleach fan, but if you're only looking for Opening/Closing songs, I suggest you look to the individual artists or CD singles."
5,Faith Evans old school CD,Great CD a classic. I was excited to locate a Old School R&B CD. The delivery was superb I received the item as promised. Will definitely purchase more Old School CDs in the future.
1,"We Just Understand It As a Prayer, Gary","I have noticed that most of the reviewers for this book are from Gary Gilley's own church family. I understand the reason that the ""Prayer for Jabez"" has become so popular, but I don't understand why this author continually tears down their beliefs. I believe most true Christian's understand that this is only one prayer from the Bible and that they don't need a whole book from him to explain otherwise."
5,MASE'S ABLUM IS THE BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"MASE SHOULD THE BEST SOLO ALBULM, BEST DRESSED, BEST RAPPER NEXT TO TUPAC AND B.I.G. AWARDS. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. WE HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON WE SHARE THE SAME BIRTHDAY 8/27. THE BAD BOY FAMILY MUST DO A CONCERT IN JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI."
1,Knowing how to rap would be good on a rap album.,"I only bought this CD because of DMX, Eightball, and MJG. Mase has never appealed to me and I'll never understand why he does to so many other people, maybe it's the cold weather up north. Regardless, it's entertainment and I guess he's entertaining someone. It's just that somewhere along the way he didn't learn to rap, in fact, he mumbles through the entire album. That said, if you like this sort of thing go ahead and buy the album."
4,Mase is bombin better than Puff!,"Most of Mase's songs are awesome, including 24 Hours to Live and Die for U, but he's bit too self centered. His last song was bogus. His lyrics and beats are tight, and this could win the Grammy. He's the best Bad Boy or Soso DEf, whatever!"
2,How Dissapointing,"Mase really surprised me, perhaps it was the other annoying voice on all of his previous tracks, Puff Daddy, that drew my attention away from his slow drawl. Mase would sound really great over a Sauve House, So So Def, or No Limit beat but over the fast paced Bad Boy hitmen beats he can't catch up. Some tracks, ""Playas Way"", ""24 Hours TO Live"" are high energy tracks of course ""24 Hours"" is saved by DMX and Black Rob and ""Playas Way"" by Eightball and MJG. Overall it just sounds like a bad LL Cool J album. Even looking at the album cover you can see Mase trying to impersinate LL. Mase is already leaving Bad Boy for So So Def and I can only hope that it will help his career."
1,This CD just doesn't cut it at all,"This has to be the weakest CD I have ever bought. I got the CD right before Mase blew up. The first couple times I listened to it; it was ok, but it got old and bad very quickly. The only song I kind of like is 24 Hours to Live. Unless you like Mase's weak lyrics and beats, I DO NOT recommend buying this CD."
5,Great cd,"this is the best pop cd in hip hop history and one of bad boys best releases other then black robs life story and notorious bigs cds mase left at a good time after a terrible cd in double up i think he left cause Big L died and Biggie but i would like mase to come back and at least work with kanye westFavorite Track:Take YoursGuests:DMX,Eightball & MJG,Black Rob,Puff Daddy,Total,Lil'Kim,Lox8.5 of 10 lyrics 8.5 of 10 beats"
1,Don't Buy This CD,"Don't buy this CD unless you are a teenage girl infatuated with Mase's baby-face, because otherwise, not even the cover will hold any sort of appeal. Notice that most of the five star reviews of this album contain somewhere in them ""Mase is the cutest man alive"" or ""Mase is my honey-bunny."" Now let's be real. If you know anything about rap or even take rap seriously, this cannot be a good sign. When Mase rhymes over music (I hesitate to call it rap, and it's hard to say rhymes when sometimes he doesn't do that), he sounds like my drunk uncle Pookie. He slurs everything he says and rhymes at a snail's pace. The only part of the album that can even be considered mildly gratifying are the guest appearances, which actually aren't even that impressive. Hey, I gave Mase a chance, but I guess I probably shouldn't have. Oh well. We can just toss this album in the 'Pop' trash bin where it belongs..."
1,Flimsy,One bowl arrived intact the other was crumbled pieces. Not happy with quality of product. Would not recommend it because it is too flimsy.
5,"If you like all of his other stuff, you will LOVE this","Bright Eyes is my favorite band. I started out listening to I'm Wide Awake and moved from there to others. This album is the last bright eyes album I discovered, but I am incredibly in love with it. The tracks capture raw emotion, creative lyrics, and an incredible arrangement, all from an 18 year old. Difference in the Shades and Touch are my personal favorites from the album, but the most popular with BE fans is June on the West Coast. GET THIS ALBUM, you will not be sorry."
5,Poetic Therapy,"This is one the best CD's I've heard in a long time. If you have ever felt like your life wasn't going the way it should. If your 16 or 30 this album is for you. Conor says the things some of us feel and does it with such honesty. This CD is so addictive. Standout Tracks: Contrast and Compare, Pull My Hair,Padraic my Prince."
4,NBA 2K7 is awesome,"First of all, you can't beat the graphics on this game, at least not right now. It's a lot of fun. The players are so life like right down to the way they play in real life. It's a little bit of a challenge to navigate some of the menus but other than that this game is great!"
2,Not impressed,"OK I've been playing 2k7 for ps2 and then i get the ps3 and get 2k7 for ps3 and its the same exact thing except the one for ps2 is alittle bit better. I honestly think they just put any old thing together just so they have 2k7 for ps3 they shouldve taken their time and put out something that would just make u be like wow that was good and dump ur ps2 in the trash. Another thing the players faces dont look realistic, ima knick fan and when i saw Eddie Curry it looked so bad i had to laugh many of the players are unrecognizeable, also it seems that every player shoots the same. Another thing is the arenas, u think they wouldve made them look very realistic, madison square garden looked terrible, the floor isn't the right type wood color looks like some parkay looking. Player control is like slippery... watever. this is a good game for ps2 and if u expect better from ps3 ur not gonna get it but maybe next year they'll take their time."
1,buyer's remorse,This is without a doubt the worst cologne I ever bought. I must admit that I bought it from amazon based on reviews and pictures of the bottle--clearly the wrong way to buy cologne!
4,Alice in Wonderland,"This is the original story by Lewis Carroll and illustrated by John Tenniel, of how Alice fell down the rabbit hole. She falls asleep in the lap of her sister and has a most excellent adventure. Read the book. I'm not going to tell the story here."
4,"no improvement over 3.1, but it works","Upgraded from Groove 3.1. No real improvement, in fact it seems a little more selective in timing of messages sent and syncing with other co-workers. But, other than that - the possibilities with new plugins sounds interesting."
2,how to frame a fig,"definately NOT one of don knotts best films, but it was ok as a part of my collection. it was reasonably priced and arrived in a decent amount of time."
2,Error ridden,"Agree with most of the other reviewers in that the photography is beautiful. However, the recipes fall short. Be warned that if you really wish to make these cakes, the recipes are rife with error, poor translation from the French and ommissions which should not happen if carefully edited. We have made several comparisons with the French edition and confirmed errors with Maison du Chocolat themselves. There are some stunning mistakes with ingredients and bake times that can be amusing if you are adept when you bake. By all means purchase if you wish a coffee table display."
3,"Very soothing, but...","I am not sure if this product is more for me or for my son. It is very soothing and relaxing, but it is no miracle cd. If your baby is in the throes of a fit, this is not going to make him stop crying, but it works well to help calm him, along with your own soothing methods (recommended: Happiest Baby on the Block book). It is great for ambient noise in the background while the baby sleeps, or for a nice relaxing night time feeding session. We have this cd and a mother's heartbeat cd set to lullabies. We play one or the other (along with his humidifier which has a loud fan) every night. I like the product and I am glad that I own it, but could I have done without it? Yes, it is not necessary. It is not some baby sleep thru the night break-through. Baby will eventually sleep thru the night, but not because of this cd."
4,Red Nichols vintage recordings,This CD was a very good example of Red Nichols and the Five Pennies .
3,Overall good but ...,"It is good for starters, but it is difficult to understand from photos the exact movements. Some arrows drawn by hand would do the trick."
5,"Clear, Consise and Useful","From warm-ups through to competion sparring, this book covers it all. Each major kick is clearly outlined in a number of pages. The pictures are not 100% clear but all in all an excellent buy."
5,Can't go wrong with organic!,"Keep a fruit fly trap handy and nearby if growing the wheatgrass. I also soak and sprout for dehydrated breads, pizza crusts and crackers. Yum!"
3,Did not like as much as others but ok,I was not so happy about the flavor of this wheat grass after grown. A little more bitter than one I have bought in the past. The price is great for the quanity.
3,Great book !,"This is a great book about Mt Chocurua & the surrounding areasin the White Mountains of New Hampshire.It's fun to read about these places from the perspective of 1893, & then go back there in 2009 & compare what these areas look like now!The only problem I have with this reprinted book isthat the print is unusually & uncomfortably small.Also there are none of the pictures that are featured in theoriginal format.Other than that it is a great read!"
3,2.75 - Potential best to come.....,"I would have to say that this is one of the better chick lit books that I have read of late. The mystery theme really helps to sustain the readers' interest and keeps the book from focusing on Rachel's self esteem issues (all too common in the genre). Overall, the book was enjoyable although not worth purchasing. Not exactly five-star material, but I could see this author getting better with time. I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewer who mention the incessant plugging of Diet Coke & Blackberry = annoying and needless! Too much product overkill!"
4,AT LAST THE LAST,"This, one in a long series of discs fron Chronological Classics, is not especially compared to the others. It's great music by great musicians. But what makes it so special to me is that it is the one I have been missing for years. Several purchases (from Amazon) have disappeared in thin air. Now I have it and my collection is complete. Pity that the series is discontinued as I looked forward for many more years of collecting."
1,Disappointed,Unfortunately I have not received this book. It was cancelled from my order as Amazon could not get it for me even though they had it advertised on their website. Thankfully I wasn't charged for this order.
1,nasty aftertaste; don't buy it,"This is the first gluten free flour I tried, and I foolishly bought flour, and some different muffin and cookie mixes of the same brand. I ended up thowing most of it in the trash. Its aftertaste is extremely off-putting. I've heard theories about what causes the nasty taste in this flour, but am not interested in any explanations, since I have no intention of rationalizing the bad taste and forcing myself to eat it anyway.Since then, I've tried some gluten free products that are not bad and taste fine, so I don't see any reason to ever buy Bob's baking mixes of any kind. They should do something about their blend if they want to stay competitively in the business. I would give it fewer than one stars if that were an option."
2,"Tastes too ""Beany""","I am fairly new to gluten-free baking. Since mixing a good gluten-free flour mix is still hit and miss for me, I decided to give this all-purpose mix a try. Even though it bakes quite well, the taste is way too strong, and nothing that I associate with cookie or cake taste. It leaves a bitter, ""beany"" aftertaste that neither me nor my son could get over. We used the flour to make christmas cookies, and unfortunately, the whole batch ended up in the trash because nobody liked them.I'm probably going to try to use the rest of the flour in a savory pastry in the hope that the bean flavor will not be so distracting and actually blend in. Otherwise, I will continue my own mixes, and will continue to look for a good-tasting pre-blend."
1,HORRIBLE,Horrible taste. I LOVE all sorts of Bobs Red Mills products and recommend them all the time. But this flour tastes absolutely horrible.I made a cake and it tasted so bad I had to throw it away and I can usually eat anything. So I thought well maybe I shouldn't have tried using olive oil so I made the cake again with xpeller pressed coconut oil and it STILL tasted so bad I had to throw the enter cake out again.So I thought well maybe it is the rice milk I used so I broke down and tried regular milk and again BAD BAD BAD flavor.All this time I NEVER thought it was the flour because WHY would Bob's Rd Mill sell something so bad.So I tried YET AGAIN and I used real sugar instead of the stevia I was using. And AGAIN YUK! YUK! YUK!Then I switched the flour and bam that was it! So I just threw away 6 lbs of Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Multipurpose Baking powder.
1,YUCK!,We have yet to find (trust me tried ALOT of them) a mix that Bob Red Mill's sells that taste good. It's down right awful and gritty. If you think this is good your surely missing out on alot of other great products. It seems some new age products coming out are alot better tasting and the consistancy is much better. Search around try Jules but this stuff is gross and regreted buying a case of it.
1,Caution: Strong Garbanzo Bean Flavor!,"If you like garbanzo beans, you will like the flour. If not, try to find a flour without this ingredient. It tends to overpower some baked foods. For example, cookie dough made with this tastes awful; when you bake the cookies, they are almost tolerable. Sorry, since I love the other products by this company, but this one isnt on my reorder list."
3,Does not exchange cup for cup like other GF flours,"Other all purpose gluten free flours I have tried, such as King Aurthur and Gluten Free pantry, have exchanged cup for cup in simple recipes such as muffins and pancakes. This flour does not, because it dissolves too much and makes the batters and dough too thin.Cookies burn on the bottom, and sweets in general have too much of an after taste.Can be used in specific recipes made for this flour, and I do like it's health value for the bean element, but I will not purchase it again."
5,The Ultimate Ship Modeller,"This is not a book on how to build ship models. Instead, it is a detailed look at the art of modelling from the perspective of a true master - Donald McNarry, Fellow of the Royal Society of the Arts, builder of the most detailed and realistic ship models ever seen in miniature scale. McNarry puts as much detail into a 1:1200 scale model as most builder's models have in 1:48 scale.McNarry's idea of a proper model in 1:1200 scale is that decks should be planked to scale, rigging should be laid up to scale with the right number of strands, etc.His models are so finely detailed that they sometimes literally have to be examined under a microscope to really appreciate his workmanship.This is not a book for those with shaky self esteem. None of us will ever have any hope of matching McNarry as a modeller, but I personally found it an inspiration to strive for my best."
4,Better Than 2K8,"Although NHL 2K8 has more features and better graphics, the gameplay on 2K7 is better."
5,Fan from California!! IT'S THE BOMB!!!!,"I have to say that my mom was nervous about the CD but even when she heard it she loved it! It's one of my favorite CD's. I'm reallly not into ""Rap"" myself but this CD is off the hook! It's the BEST!!!"
2,Pretty Boring for Stuart Woods,"What happened to Stuart Woods? I felt like this book was written by someone else. I have read about 10 of his books and I have loved every one of them, except Under the Lake which I found a little strange. Most of it was predictable. Maybe this book was just too ""political"" for me."
5,The Run keeps Woods fan happy,"What a perfect time to read The Run during this, a presidental election year. This is a great read for any student of the presidental selection process. Instead of bombarding you with the dozens of characters one could in examing the election of a president, Woods offers only a few that are excellent composites of current political personalities today. A quick and concise read, The Run still left me feeling like I had a comprehensive view of Will Lee's pursuit of the presidency."
4,GOOD SUMMER READ!,"I am a big fan of Stuart Woods and have read nearly ALL of his books. Frankly, the last few books I'd read were a bit disappointing. I was anxious to read The Run and I loved it! As in all Woods books, it hooks you right away and reads fairly easily. I found the story exciting and I eagerly read each chapter, anxious to know what would happen next. The story was compelling, well researched and a thriller. I'm surprised by the readers who don't like the book, but I think it helps greatly to have read Woods' ""Grass Roots"" to help identify with many of the characters in ""The Run"". Because I enjoy following politics -- the conventions, the races, etc. I found this aspect particularly interesting. This Stuart Woods book is very good and I would recommend it to others who want a fast paced, easy read for the summer!"
3,"empty, but fun","This is not a brilliant piece of literature, but for beach or Saturday afternoon piled up on the couch it was fun. Some of the plot machinations were a bit strained, but it moved at a good pace. I found myself wanting the candidate to win, so I must have been fairly involved. it would make a good cable movie."
2,RUNS on tooo long,"I have read many of Mr. Woods' novels and this is by far his worst. His transparent attempts to promote the liberal political agenda overshadowed the already predictable and plodding story line. What made it even more boring was that he had few of his political facts straight. There were many technical errors in the book (eating chocolate will kill a dog and the social security number IS a military individuals service number).The funniest line of the book is the very last one ( author's note), where Mr. Woods instructs his readers that to find his older books go to a used or online bookstore, or "" otherwise, you will have to go to a great many garage sales."" I am glad I borrowed this book from the library; having to pay for it would have added insult to injury."
3,"new, improved and not lemon-freshened ;)","The product has improved by removing hormone-changing parabens (good); however, the new formula sort of smells like Bactine antiseptic spray. Also, I sprayed a bit much on my face and it ran down to my lips and numbed them a little."
1,Was this supposed to be a comedy???,"I have been a fan of Irish Dance for many years and enjoyed many parts of Flatley's other productions. I rented this DVD expecting to gleen some positives out of it as well. I was disappointed. The ""story"" was hard to follow, the women's costumes quite bare, and Michael oblivious to how silly the whole thing was. Other than a few short instances of Michael's amazing dancing, my Irish dancing daughter and I actually laughed ourselves to tears at times as we watched this."
3,"Good Music, Good Album, Good Group",This is a very good group. They are talented and have that sort of new 90's TLC thing going on but since TLC is back they better watch out. But they are okay.
5,This CD Rocks,I've seen this band over and over and have a couple of thier CD's even though I think only two were released. They put on a GREAT! show and if someone is looking to try something new they ROCK!
5,B.I.G. set's the mood every time with this classic,"""Big Poppa"" is a song that I can listen to whenever I feel like reminding myself of what it's all about. The life I'd like to live, friends, Moet, ho's, all for the show... Biggie Smalls cooked up a classic cause like him, I too love it when the girls call me Big Poppa!"
2,Tangerine lotion,I wanted a tangerine aroma which this lotion has but it is so thin that it just runs out and all over. The scent is okay but I won't be purchasing it again.
3,over produced,"This is my least favorite RR album. The raw natural acoustics which was their signature is no where to be found on this album. This album is over produced and sounds like the music was copied and pasted verse by verse. The percussion has gone from physical to digital and what happened to the artwork? Overall this album is still better then most of the stuff in music today but if their albums continue to follow the rest, thats exactly what they will be. Please go back to the traditional roots of music and leave technology for the techno artists."
1,A silly book,"Jesus in Egypt is a silly book. Masquarading as a serious biblical study book, instead it is a travelogue of all the tourist rip-offs in Egypt where desparate people try to convince rich foreigners that ""this is the place where..."" I can imagine Perry doing a follow-up entitled ""Bigfoot in Seattle"".This is not to say that the connections between Jesus and Egypt should be ignored. There are many connections here, and books like Freke & Gandy's ""Jesus Mysteries"" address some of them as does Alvar Ellegard in his book ""100 years before Christ""The one saving grace of this book is that it is well written. Had it been renamed ""My tax deductible summer in Egypt"" I would probably give it 5 stars. Well, no. Not 5. For a travelogue, this book is mysteriously devoid of pictures and maps, except for the head shots of the people he meets along the way."
5,The Hook on Veejay Records,"This is a nice compilation of JL Hookers Veejay sides from the late 50's and early 60's.Most of the tracks have full band backing and there are a few solo remakes of some of his earlier hits.A great introduction to the blues of JL Hooker.tracks include dimples,whiskey & women,I'm so excited,onions,no shoes,drug store woman,boom boom,hobo blues,little wheel,dusty road,baby lee,want ad blues,boogie chillun,crawlin king snake,tupelo,trouble blues,maudie,time is marching,I'm in the mood,and blues before sunrise.20 songs and they are all good."
2,Boooo,"I bought 3 bottles of this because I have a trial size of this and loved it!! However, this product is nothing like the trial size! Smells bad and does nothing for my hair. Maybe I received a bad batch?? Not sure, but now stuck with 3 bottles of this :-(On a brighter note, shipping was very fast!"
4,a social services-oriented mystery,"What I like about Nancy Pickard is that she writes more than a mystery. She does a nice job here with the social services world. It is the balance between that world and the ""crime fiction"" that I was expecting that drew me in. She does a great job with settings -- most commonly in the few Jenny Cain books I've read, with the cold, dreary New England winters. She handles issues of mental illness in an adept and realistic fashion, without getting too heavy or losing the pacing that a mystery should hvae."
1,The Real Belize,"This is the title to my new book, not yet out. I have read lans, if there were ever a time for an honest look at Belize and the people that want to live, play, own or sell it. The time is now."
5,Great book,My father served in the 1st marine division in WWII in the Pacific but would never talk about it. So for me reading these recollections enabled me to hear what he experienced....incredible stuff.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a flavor of the real guys who fought and what they experienced.
2,Exquisitely boring,"Oh, it's mixed well. The sound quality is perfect.The performance is precise. Vanska knew exactly what he wanted and the orchestra delivered with perfection.Precise, perfect, perfunctory, yet utterly lacking in anything primal.Performances of the ninth either fill me with rapture or revulsion, but this is the first that could bore me to tears. Vanska is like a valedictorian trying to pass some kind of standardized exam.Pass on this."
4,Difficulties in playing the DVD,"The series is one of my all time favorites, the episodes here are great. BUT whoever is responsible for manufacturing these disks should appear before the public in sackcloth and ashes, re-manufacture them and offer exchanges for free. I have FOUR DVD players and each one of them had trouble playing side one, disk 3, cuts 3 and 4. I have yet to go thru the other episodes on the back. However I did find that my computer DVD drive will play all the episodes with no problem. What's going on here? There is no reason for this shoddy production."
1,not what I expected,"I ordered Ghosttowns and Kingdoms because I love the song ""Wear white to my funeral"" which I heard on the radio.I'm glad I bought the CD because I really like that song, but the rest of the CD leans more towards country and/or folk music.If it had been available for download, I should've just downloaded it."
2,Small and rough handle,"The pan is smaller than I expected. Furthermore, the handle is very roughly made and feels very uncomfortable. To me, this is a big minus since that's the part I touch when I cook and it must be comfortable. Amazon doesn't specify this, but this item is made in China. Sorry, but had I known this I would not have purchased it. Buyers beware!"
4,Easy to Clean,"This pan is very easy to clean. However, the small base won't sit stably on my gas range. I keep a hand on the handle and pay attention to how it sits on the range to overcome the problem."
1,...yellowing.,i've been using this product for a while and i don't know why i continue to do so... it yellows all the time. i've gone through 3 bottles.. same thing every time.
1,An amateurish book filled with little real information.,"I've been bamboozled on books in the past, but never this badly. Information is mostly anecdotal, which would be okay if it was interesting or informative, which it is not. Even in areas where the authors should be qualified to dispense information, such as selecting decoys or designing a decoy spread, it is scant. Frequent technical errors; such as snow geese breed during spring migration or that spring hunting was allowed prior to 1940. At least in the Nebraska section, the information given for game limits was incorrect. Poorly written. Self published for obvious reasons. If they gave this book away when you purchased a goose call it would be priced about right."
2,"clever but gory story, few laughs","I find Dave Barry's weekly humor column a joy to read, and was expecting something similar in this book.I did laugh out loud maybe ten times while reading this book, and the story does cleverly weave eight or ten sub-plots into a more or less coherent (but not very believable) whole, but there's too much blood, violence, and evil people in this book to make it enjoyable for me. It was not at all what I expected. Perhaps Dave is trying to break out of being type-cast."
2,A bit TOO much!,"I am a very, very, very, big fan of Dave Barry. But, this book underminds his intellegent writing. I loved Big Trouble. It had a wonderful but simple plot. I mean it HAD a plot! Tricky Business lacks that one important detail you need in a book. It seems this book just tries to pull us along by American Pie gross-out humor. There was no thought put into they way people acted or killed each other. Just cut the balls off, and get it over with. Compared to Tim Dorsey or Hiassan, who think of funny invetive ways to kill people. The characters are too sterotypical. I found myself not caring for any of the characters if they died or lived, it made no difference to me. This book was just churned out of the factory like a really bad movie sequel."
3,"Good, not up to standard set in Big Trouble","Dave Barry has written another entertaining book, but not even close to the quality of his debut novel, Big Trouble. This is a quick read, but I would wait for the paperback to buy this one.To be honest, it almost seemed like Mr. Barry was trying to write a novel from which you could make a movie. There is a lot of fast flowing dialogue but the descriptions leave a little to be desired.There is something to be said for focusing on conversation between characters, but it made the book light.I do love Barry's humour and the way that things mentioned in page 2 always show up in page 150, when you are least expecting it."
4,Losta laffs.,"Dave Barry's ""Tricky Business"" is an amusing, satirical South Florida romp. An assortment of losers, bad dudes, seniors and a bad rock band are mixed together on a gambling ship amid Hurricane Hector.Naturally the ship in a mob owned drug exchange vessel that must make a rendezvous. Of course a nefarious double-cross is afoot.And so, the games begin.When one of the central characters started as a crooked airbag replacement king---moved up to cut-rate LASIK centers---founded Happy Conch fast fooderies (no conch, just fried batter to lower costs)---you know irony, humor and derision will keep you rapidly turning pages.The sardonically embellished vignettes of Miami life alone are worth the price of admission.""Tricky Business"" is funny business."
1,Why can't I rate less than 1?,"I'm a long-time Dave Barry fan. I enjoy his writing, have always subscribed to any local newspaper that published his column. He's hilarious, irreverent, consistently and predictably unpredictable.But this book is bad, simply and unforgiveably, bad. Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. Not one chuckle in the whole d____d thing. I didn't pay much, but wasted way too much money and time on this really bad book.Don't do likewise. Save your money. Buy any newspaper that includes his column, and have a good time. Just don't spend good money on this really bad book.What it comes down to is: This book would never have been published if the author's name was not Dave Barry."
1,Dave Barry should stick to humor columns,"When I bought this book, I did not realize that it was a novel. I thought it was the usual collection of his columns. When I started reading it, I was quite pleasantly surprised, since the way he introduced the characters was quite interesting and funny.After all the characters were in place, however, the book degenerated into a mish mash of slap stick. After a while, it was difficult to keep track of who was where and doing what to whom.A total disaster."
2,Not My Favorite Barry,"The other books by Dave Barry that I've read are among my favorite reading experiences: ""Dave Barry's Book of Bad Songs,"" ""Complete Guide to Guys,"" ""Dave Barry Does Japan,"" ""Dave Barry Turns 50,"" ""Dave Barry is Not Making This Up"" ...Like many readers, I regard Dave Barry as a national treasure and a wonder of nature, like the redwoods. How could one man be so consistently funny and so smart and so appealing, all at the same time?""Tricky Business"" is the first Barry book to disappoint me.I didn't find it funny, and I didn't like it.I can see why other readers may like it, though. They may just have different senses of humor than I.Old men making fart and prune jokes in a nursing home, a mafioso physically menacing a sleazy businessman, repeated ""jokes"" about women with breast implants, just didn't work for me.In place of laughs, I didn't find much else I wanted to read about. The characters, the plot, and the writing style didn't compel."
2,not funny at all,"I was severely disappointed by this book. With the ratings it was given here, I thought it would be a funny read. I didn't laugh once, I didn't find it witty or worth while. There was nothing to anticipate and nothing to look forward to. It was just not a book I would recommend to anyone.The book had an entire chapter devoted to projectile vomiting. Which I guess if you were 13 would be funny."
5,Perfect!!,The item was shipped very quickly as I received it within 4 days. The item was packed very well and arrived undamaged. The item worked easily and perfectly. Thanks
3,She could have done better,"I love Dr. Schwartz. At the University of Washington in the `80s, she and Philip Blumstein did the definitive research on bi women and later wrote a great examination of married life. This book, however is beneath that standard. The 25 ""myths"" she debunks are more pop culture and less science. I got the distinct impression that she phoned in a paycheck.If you want to read her better work on love and marriage, find an old copy of their opus, ""American Couples: Money, Work and Sex."""
3,Good to read once . . .,"This was a good one time read. I would not want to read it again because I found myself annoyed with the main characters. All the problems she found herself in were her own doing. Granted, there was a lot of action and romance, I still found the book silly and trite. Reade it once, then give it to a friend. This one is not a keeper."
5,Grandson loves it,He'd been wanting it since June and it was his favorite present on Christmas morning.
4,Missing parts.,"Update: Amazon replacement works fine. Does what it's suppose to. Would recommend for small pools.Missing the bottom white adjustable cartridge bottle. Item manufacturing packaging was already ripped opened. Paint on both the eyes of the frog and it's head completely gone. This was obviously a used, then returned item that Amazon just shipped out to the next buyer. They didn't even bother repackaging it, just tossed in the gator head with the torn paper wrapping in a box and shipped it out to me. Very, very disappointed with Amazon."
2,Bad worksmanship,"It looks nice and unique if used as a display. But in pool water where it is exposed to chemicals and sun, it fails big time. Paint starts chipping and fading( I live in FL-The sunshine state!). Head screw is lose. it does not tighten up. When kids jumping into the pool, strong waves pushes to side of the pool impact severes the head( brrr!)If it was priced at 4.99 to 6.99 range, it would worth but at $17 range, it is way over priced."
1,Reconsider,I found this to be a nearly useless publication that was obviously was designed to generate some income for the AMA by preying on those starting or selling a medical practice.
3,Borrow This Book At the Library!,"I went to the library and went through pretty much the whole book. There really isn't anything unique this book has to offer, as most of its tips are rather practical and known.The longest section of the book deals with the LSAT. The advice in this section mirrors what you would read when you register with the Law School Admission Council -- when the LSAT is administered, when you should take it, how to prepare, etc.The most helpful section in this book discusses the value of volunteering during college, or doing internships with the local attorney's office. However, you can read this section at the library in less than 15 minutes.I do not recommend buying this book. If you are really curious about its contents, just go to your library and check it out."
3,Not what I expected.....,"I am disappointed..., great graphics, but to me, that's about it. They have the sound close, but not close enough, there is a very vauge car setup screen, and the cars really don't handle that well. Put it this way, I was driving one car on a track that had some long streight streches. I assumed that it would be best to have the ""tall"" gear setting for this. I assumed that I would still be pulling higher sppeds before I had to slam on the breaks, but no. The engine revved out WAY before the next turn. Not nearly enough car settings. But it is multi-player ""A+"". I think they could have done better. But again, the graphics, especially the ice tracks, are pure art!"
2,Disappointed,I have read 8 books of Sandra Hill's and loved all of them until this one. It lacked interesting characters and kept repeating events over and over. The main characters got very boring and there were not any new adventurs to take them on. Maybe if they went into a time travel adventure they would have been more interesting. I was bored and didn't like this book. I will finish the other books in the series hoping they will be as good as the first ones in the series. I do love the Viking series and the time travel series. Everyone has a bad day now and then.Lets hope this was the only one.
4,Sandra Hill does it again!,"Sandra Hill does it again. She delivers a passionate, enthralling novel laced with her usual dose of good humor. She also brings a fresh new twist to the marriage of convenience plot device. Lady Eadyth is a headstrong, independent lady we can all relate to. She runs her own business making candles and holds her head high despite condemnation from society about her child born out of wedlock.Like all of Hill's heroes, Eirik of Ravenshire is virile and handsome, but he has a few flaws that make him very endearing to the reader. His nearsightedness, combined with Eadyth's ruse of being an ugly, old crone--so she can avoid the usual marital duties--creates a hilarious situation. Eadyths bees are good for even more laughs. The dialogue crackles with energy and wit as do Eadyth's inner thoughts.This book is also very sensual, and the lovemaking seemed more real to me than any book I've ever read. It was as if I was there living it.Sherri Neilson"
1,silly plot,"This was a silly plot with unlikable characters. I mean, would it not be miserable walking around all day with ""smelly"" grease in your hair, while ""crackly"" as you speak and ""stooping"" as you walk as the heroine does in orders to hide her ""beauty"". Also, the heroine has a son and the hero has two daughters, who never receive any attention or affection from either parents. This is a very uncomfortable read. Don't waist your money. I cannot understand why it has 4 stars"
5,happy purchase,"Love my pattern for doll house. I have pattern but can't find so needed to get another. I have already made house once and it took three years. My granddaughter played so much with house that it started slopping. I am now going to make house in wood but sew all floors,walls and furniture."
3,It would be outdated but....,"At the beginning of 2006, Java 6 is looming on the horizon, so this book could be considered obsolete, were it not for the fact that most veteran java programmers have remained lazily barricated in the previous ( and now enciant ) java versions. In another case of the disciple surpassing the master, java grows form the simple, crystal clear laguage it was at his birth to a way more intimidating beast than C++, and if you happen to be one the programmers who have been left behind this text is a good and now cheap chance to absorb the features added in the 1.4 realease: NIO, assertions, regexp. NOte that this is not a java tutorial, it has been written for programmers already fluent in java, but needing a tutorial on the 1.4 extensions.The presentation style is really clear, but I do have some issues with the code examples which in some case are a bit contrived and in a couple of cases are flawed."
1,Stay away from this disaster,"Sorry Microsoft, but your ""ribbon"" user interface is the most retarded upgrade feature ever. It renders all your Office applications useless. I have no interest spending hours to learn a completely different UI and to recustomize the toolbar all over again (I'm not even sure if it's even possible to customize the ""ribbon""). The ribbon is ugly and WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY too big.My advice: try to avoid upgrading for as long as possible."
3,I Like It ...BUT...,"I found it to be a really powerful tool. It has so many new bells and whistles that it is going to take me a long time to get use to it. Most of the frequently used knobs and switches are no longer in it's usual spot. Nevertheless, I was still prepared to go through the learning process. My change of heart came when I was shocked and horrified to find out that this software refused to open some word documents that were created with an older version of Microsoft Word. Since my bread and butter depends on opening and editing older word documents I had no other choice but to remove 2007 and replace it with the older stuff. Boy oh boy what a let down."
3,Meh.,Not the best update if you're not great at adapting to new things in old software. Its actually quite useful once you get used the new format but if you can't (like so many people here on amazon) then don't update! Stick to the old versions. It'll still get the job done.
4,Much easier to use then previous versions,"Compared to previous versions, Microsoft Office 2007 is much easier to use. The layout of Word and related programs are easier to get around in and find what you're looking for."
1,Microsoft Office Professional 2007,When I made the order it was for global use. But the product you shipped was specifically for Asia. Why did you send such a product to the USA.Secondly the product is for the installers only who have whatever tney call an installation key.This product was just a rip off of my money as I cannot use it in my US computer.
1,"never got it, and Amazon NEVER HELPED ME W/SITUATION!!!","never got item from the crook seller, and when i tried to have Amazon help me w/the situation - AMAZON DID NOTHING!!!!!!!wtf do *you* think??!"
3,I'm not sure if I should even bother. Please help.,"I've just got a new job and everyone in the office seems to use 2007 and was thinking about even getting certified (MCAS). I've been a long time user of 2003 and previous versions but from reading the negative reviews here, I'm a little hesitant in buying this and the study guide and going through the whole nine yards in getting tested for the certification.Is the 2007 THAT DIFFERENT? Are things like the ""draw"" function renamed and replaced elsewhere on the interface as well with a different icon (as a previous poster had mentioned on page 1)?Please help me decide, thank you!"
2,The learning curve is huge. HUGE.,"The contempt and arrogance of the designers of previous users is downright scary. Every review I read that claims the Office upgrade is anything but a catastrophe, I have to wonder who signs their paycheck.If you know the office suite well, heaven forbid an expert, the Word, PowerPoint or Excel upgrades are at best a very painful experience, Finding the high end features will frustrate the heck out of you. There is no choice either; you have to learn everything again.To be fair, the suite works fine, however, everything I've ever learned every functional or utilitarian approach is lost. Lost is the analogy for the whole upgrade. I can't believe I paid Microsoft to torture me like this."
1,awful,"this is a bad product - it is as if they had a focus group of the most basic users that had little experience with MS Office - it takes me longer to do everything - rather than having one menu, you are tabbing through tons of tabbed menus. Then, some of the most important menus, like page setup, are a tiny square at one corner of a tab - dumb....Also the automations are extreeeeemly annoying - it took us about two days to figure out why our powerpoints were getting grainy, here it keeps compressing things every time you save - to a point where you could not read them...."
1,cannot be more user - UNfriendly,"since my company installed Vista and the new Office pack on our PCs, we probably total hundreds of hours in LOST PRODUCTIVITY we should bill to Microsoft.Who are the mindless tech geeks behind the new design of Word and Excel ? Why did they decide to make our job harder by changing everything to the worst ?It took me hours to learn how to use Excel again, to find the most simple functions since the toolbar has now a new design and one that is less than intuitive. The old customization options are gone. So when you're used to quick shortcut buttons, it's maddening.The whole design of Office is similar and lacks in simplicity.SECURITY is everywhere and messages pop-up all the time about what you can and cannot do (mainly the latter). This is an OFFICE version meant to be obscure.The only positive point to this disheartening piece of s.... software is that it will allow competition to get it. It's high time consumers start voting with their feets."
3,Office Version 2007 Review,"I purchase two copies of this product, one installed fine and is working well,the other Version appeared to install and when registering was provide with another set of numbers and instructions to contact Microsoft and provide them with another set of numbers that appeared in this installation, I did as instructed and was informed by Microsoft that the reistration code for that product was invalid and I should return it to were I purchased it for a replacement product or a refund of my purchase price!What is your response to this ????My email is jgualt@kayjay.com ???"
1,The Worst!,"MS shafts us again. This is quite possibly the worst ""upgrade"" in a long line of crud that BG has forced down our throats. This version of Word is so complicated and unfriendly its hard ot impagin what they were thinking other than lets make a new version to make $$$$> If your using Office 2003, stick with it! It's a much better product!"
2,Less efficient,"If you were not very used to Office or hadn't used it at all, Office 2007 will be easier to learn initially. That said, if you were good at using the old software, you will find this new layout very inefficient and frustrating. It is icon-laden and trying to be user friendly way too hard, so much so that it kills what was previously good about it.Outlook is still good, but Word & Excel have pretty much been reduced to useless. Stick with the old version if you can."
2,Word is not useful anymore.,"Excel is probably one of the best applications in existence in the business world. Power Point is quite pedestrian, which is good for some executives, and quick-presentation fixes. Outlook is great, but here's where it all ends.WORD is simply an exercise in futility, and more of a waste of time than ever. I learned how to create stunning page layouts in Adobe InDesign faster (my first attempts at using Adobe products outside Photoshop) than I could master an already familiar program-Word. This is because Word suffers from formatting and alignment idiosyncrasies which will burn the user who attempts to delve into any special features, or who attempt to customize even the simplest of things. I recommend using Word for the most basic and time-saving uses, but if you want to create a document that utilizes any advanced features, you will be much more satisfied learning what the Pro's use on a daily basis."
2,Marketing Trick,"I got used to the new layout, which is actually nice. You can visually find what you are looking for. What is really annoying are the new file formats. The default document type is now a new 2007 format that only Microsoft 2007 can read. If you email this format to someone who has Office 2003, he/she cannot read it. To me this is just a marketing trick that eventually will force all users to have Office 2007. There is a 1997-2003 Word option but you have to remember to always save in this format if you want to communicate with the rest of the world."
1,Office 2007,"If you are a previous user of Office you will find Office 2007 more frustrating and slower than Office 2000. Many activities now require additional steps so it actually takes longer to get things done. For example, changing the color of a series in a chart is now about 5 steps instead of 2. Importing data into Access from another database, ditto.You will need to add frequently used commands to the 'quick' menu to prevent insanity but there is a limit to what can be added.At least Microsoft could have left an option for the 'classic' menus."
1,Horribly difficult to use,"Despite its bugs and outdated graphics, Microsoft Office 2003 was a solid suite of applications. Rather than building on the success of its business staple, Microsoft chose to overhaul the applications with a completely unintuitive user interface, in which common commands are buried in a confusing set of tabs.While excel and outlook are still somewhat usable because they kept their drop-down menus, Word and Powerpoint make me want to kill someone. It takes 10 minutes to find basic functions, and practically nothing is located in a place that would make sense. Despite some attractive graphics, my productivity has taken a step backward and I wish my company had not decided to adopt Office 2007. Complete waste of money."
2,Microsoft can be trying,"Loaded program into a Windows 7 PC. Everything loaded, Outlook started and crashed upon printing. Excel loaded and worked. All the others crashed upon launch. Removed the program from my PC and returned product for credit.The support for installation problems is non-existant. The on-line automatic troubleshooting says everything is OK, but they don't know what is causing the crashing. I got Office 2008 for my iMAC. Everything loaded and worked right out of the box. What a difference. There are just too many different architecture systems in the PC world. Amazon was great with arranging for my return of the product."
1,"Terrible service, no delivery",I waited weeks for the item with no success. A letter to the seller went without a response. It finally took a complaint from me to Amazon to get reimbursed. So I am still without the program.
1,What a disappointment,"Low power collection of loose parts that are much more willing to come apart than go together. It seems to have been designed by someone with a grudge against people who enjoy cooking. Clumsy, difficult to load, close and feed. Chops unevenly, purees badly; a bit worse and the bloody thing would cross over into frightening to use. Just not a good choice if you want something useful in the kitchen."
4,MS Standard Office 2007 Upgrade,"Microsoft Office Standard 2007 Upgrade The product was delivered to my home in a few days after making my purchase. I used the free shipping option. The product was easier to install than the directions stated. It said if you were upgrading from Microsoft Works, you would need to visit Microsoft's Website to complete the upgrade. It installed with no hassle and went through the registration process after keying in the product key. The product works great. MS Outlook in 2007 has very easy to follow wizard for integrating with your email provider. If you are used to using Microsoft Office editions prior to 2007, you will notice a big difference in Word and Excel menus and toolbars. After using the product for a short time, you will adjust to the changes. If you are sending files to other users, the product has a feature where you just save as Word 97 to 2003 or Excel previous versions if needed. Works great!"
3,License allows an additional laptop install,"The product requires activation, which includes sending machine identification information to Microsoft.The good news is that the Office Standard license allows installation on both a desktop system AND a laptop. It also allows you to transfer the license to new systems, over time.From the license: ""Before you use the software under a license, you must assign that license to one device. ... You may install another copy on a portable device for use by the single primary user of the licensed device. ... You may reassign the license to a different device any number of times, but not more than one time every 90 days"""
1,It Creates Problems,"I upgraded to Microsoft Office 2007 because Microsoft no longer provides technical support for Office 2003.In my opinion the new Office 2007 is full of bugs. As an I example I had previously developed a large (23 meg) PowerPoint presentation using Office 2003 that had worked fine under PowerPoint 2003. However, Microsoft Office 2007 has now corrupted the presentation. Special graphics such as custom bullets do not display under PowerPoint 2007. Under PowerPoint 2007 the text in text boxes, such as title boxes, falls outside the box.It will probably take me more than 200 hours to clean up the mess in this presentation that was caused by upgrading to Microsoft Office 2007.In summary, beware of switching to Microsoft Office 2007 if you have previously developed large files under Office 2003."
3,Microsoft Office Standard 2007 edition,"Great item, always reliable but I do have acopy but want to upgrade having SSD drive purchase. I have no problems with this type of software hope other people feel the same way.Regards Jon."
2,Keep Office 2003 as long as you can,"Instead of getting more intuitive, the menus / ribbons are cryptic. I considered myself as a quite fast user of most features of e.g. Word 2003. Now, with Word 2007, I have to consult Help every second minute and get frustrated all the time! It is even worse if on one computer you have 2003 and on another 2007. A lot of extra stress when using 2007."
3,Outlook Freezes Up,"I love the search capabilities of Outlook 2007 but it freezes up frequently. Sometimes I will log off Outlook, wait several minutes and then shut down my PC.When I restart my PC and Outlook, I get an error message indicating that the Outlook database was not shut down properly. Then Outlook takes about a minute to scan the data for errors. This is annoying. And note: I have a very fast processor so the database scan only takes a minute on my PC. On my previous laptop, with a slower CPU, it took five to ten minutes to scan a database for errors."
1,"Do NOT upgrade to Office 2007, you WILL REGRET IT","Sorry Microsoft, but your ""ribbon"" user interface is the most retarded upgrade feature ever. It renders all your Office applications useless. I have no interest spending hours to learn a completely different UI and to recustomize the toolbar all over again (I'm not even sure if it's even possible to customize the ""ribbon""). The ribbon is ugly and WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY too big.My advice: try to avoid upgrading for as long as possible."
3,necessary evil,"Not particularly fond of the new version of office. Required to run outlook with Vista. Like the 2000 version better, more straightforward."
3,Bit disappointed,"I felt that if you didn't have a reasonable knowledge of Jewish/Jerusalem history it would be easy to get lost. Luckily I'd just read Jerusalem - A Biography which helped heaps. I also worked out the diamond swap fairly early on, but I thought the solution of ownership was clever. Another interesting example of conflict among the 3 Abrahamic religions."
4,This was a good read,"I enjoyed The Jerusalem Diamond immensely and thought it an outstanding Kindle ebook deal for under $3. The ending was a bit abrupt but it's historical back & forth evoked other, better known historical fiction authors and the Judaic theme was of interest to me personally."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in this product. I bought the non-motorized version and it was good. So I thought this battery operated version would blow me out of the water. Not the case. Just get the non-motorized version (3 for 3.99). You'll get a lot more bangs for your bucks.
4,great product,We had purchased the unmotorized scalp massagers and they were great but these just kick it up a notch. Either way feels almost as good as going in the beauty shop for a shampoo!
1,BEWARE! Poorly built!,"After reading great reviews i went ahead and got this massager, i have used it for 10minutes the very first time, it was fine...then the next day i used it for like 5 minutes, and all the legs of the massage became really loose and it it never kept the octopus kinda shape again! all the legs were joined together!! it is terrible! I am sending this right back! This is my FIRST EVER item returned on amazon!"
1,Horrible product. It's very poor quality and it hurts your head.,"There are other massagers that are the same price, but much better quality. Don't waste your money, even if it is cheap!"
3,Cheap product,The massager arrived intact but when we tried to assemble it it broke. There is a little ball inside the socket that takes the wire assembly. The ball is meant to lock the assembly into the socket but when we pushed it in the ball disappeared inside the body of the massager handle. You get what you pay for.
2,Feels cheap,"This head massager is OK, but could be much better. The probes move away and bunch up. Not sure about the battery how long will last."
1,Misleading seller?,"I bought this 3 of these from this seller for last minute Christmas gifts and I am very disappointed because I thought I was buying the 'ting ting' scalp massager and I instead got a cheap lookin 'Don Long' blue and bigger looking model. I will not be returning since I dont have time to get this re-shipped before Christmas, so buyers beware with this seller. Advertises one thing ships another, at around the holidays this is unacceptable."
3,Nice... but no Tingler,"Still a good product, but I prefer ""The Tingler"" over the motorized Ting Ting. For some reason, the battery operator massager didn't have quite the amazing affect as the simple tingler."
3,What's All the Hype?,"The product works ok. It feels good, but not better than a regular massage vibrator. The copper tines were well made. The battery compartment cover seemed a little flimsy. The on/off switch seems to be pretty durable. It is a good product, but nothing to write home about."
4,Feels good,"I really enjoyed the tingling sensation created by this product. It was very relaxing. However, I have a serious scalp itch and found that the head of the Ting was more helpful to vibrate my scalp even though the ""fingers"" give a good ""scratch"". I did end up shaving my head because of the severity of my problem, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."
2,Seen It Too,I just watched this movie. I agree with everything that the first reviewer wrote. The movie was very predictable. I waited for it too come out online streaming. I'm glad I did.
1,Shouldn't a radio pick up at least ONE station?,"If I could give this radio zero stars, I would. It has NO reception. I cannot tune in even one station on either band. You pay $4 for a radio, you get a $4 radio."
3,A good example of erhu music.,"This CD contains 13 tracks of erhu music, 8 of which have supporting instrumentation such as the xiao, pipa, and guzheng. I was pleased overall, but felt the mixing could have been beter."
5,Great for a Lucy fan!,"You can buy this toy as I did for commemorative purposes or to play with. It is wondefully detailed down to Lucy's chocolates she's smuggling out. It even comes complete with more so Lucy never has to go hungry! Doll's stand tells the episode name and number. The plot line is on the back of the box, and includes the original airing date. It is great for a Lucy fan who wants something they can really display so that people will know what they think of her. A wondeful buy!"
3,Not Strong Enough,"The acrylic plate holder could not support my 6-inch plate very well. The plate isn't that heavy, but it's difficult to position the plate in a way that prevents it from tipping over.But with that being said, I am satisfied that the plate holder, at least, does not block the beautiful designs on my plate."
3,Trimmer,"This shaver is okay. It could be a little more better, because the shaving piece came apart but my husband put it back toghether for me, other then that it works."
4,International Macroeconomics and Finance,This is a well written and short concreted book. I makes a good combination of both econometrics and theoretical methods for those who have a background on these topics. The book is suitable for graduate students.
2,Not good for kindle,I have the book as well as kindle edition. The kindle edition is extremely low resolution. It won't be useful at all as its barely readable. Big disappointment.
3,wrong wheat,"My items came in great condition, but instead of the hard red winter wheat I got Spring wheat. Go figure."
5,Best patch w/out a prescription,"I actually sent this order to my father who has trouble with arthritis in his back and legs. But I use the Salonpas every time I have back pain - sometimes I use several to cover the whole area of my pain. They really work well, better than any other patch, pain cream, or spray. I highly recommend them."
3,It works.,"I've had Salonpas that comes in a foil and those are great and don't smell that bad. These work but the smell is very strong, I can't go outside with this thing because I know someone will smell it. The size is okay for targeting sharp pains. Overall it works."
4,Sslonpas does as advertised,"The Salonpas Pain Relieving Patch does what I wanted it to do. My leg & foot joints are constantly in pain due to arthritis, and the patches relieve the pain right now! Thank you Salonpas."
2,Not for everybody .... Ouch! Itch! Aaargh!,"The good news is that it does work. I have stiff neck problems and sometimes it feels like I've pinched a nerve. It became unbearable and I've tried the different kinds of creams.I saw this stuff at Costco and bought a whole box of it. Used two patches (one for each side of the shoulders) but now have two red itchy welts as a result. Can't even wear a T-Shirt as it irritates it.I have some cream that the doctor gave me for a skin allergy that I had from a FLU shot and I'm now trying that on. Hope it helps. In the meantime, all be forewarned!"
2,Salonpas vs Snogg Patch,"... or kill the pain area vs heal the pain area.i used to be a ""fan"" of salonpas for a long time, when my yoga instructor recommended to me herbal snogg patch, saying that helping heal your body is always better than temporarily kill the pain without healing it. i used to have major problems with my low back which salonpas helped me to get thru it sometimes, and after 2 sessions of snogg patch treatment pain and discomfort are gone (for 7 months already).let me tell you this: when you heal yourself - you try to take a good care of yourself afterwards; using painkillers such as salonpas kills your pain today and you forget about it, and it repeats again tomorrow, which doesn't make any sense (unless for salonpas manufacturers)..."
4,Beautiful pictures but mistakes on Grand Duchesses,"This book is beautiful. I have the one with the purple cover. This is from Alexandra and Maria's album. There are beautiful official portraits of the Big Pair and Little Par in white dresses that are breathtaking. There are also pics I have never seen so if you're a Romanov buff get it. Cute pics from Finland of the girls. However, the author repeatedly mixes up Maria with Olga. It really irritates me because I love Maria. She's my favorite. The picture is blatantly Maria but it says its Olga. To me if you're a historian you should know by looking at the the girls who is who. We need to keep their memory alive."
5,Excelente/Excellent,"Very thorough, and very-well explained! Includes practice activies with an answer key. I used this for my Masters degree in Spanish and it explained every nuance between the two languages."
4,Microsoft Office,Got my product; however it was delivered late and after the date that I was told that it would be delivered.
5,Microsoft Office Standard 2007 FULL VERSION,This is an upgrade from Microsoft Office Student Edition. I needed Outlook and the new version of Student Edition did not have it so I needed the Standard Edition.I'm very happy with the product. You'll need to work with it to understand the changes but the help section is user friendly.
1,Microsoft 2007 Office Professional,I cannot offer a proper review because I have paid almost $200 and it is now almost 4 weeks after the shipment date and I cannot get Amazon or the seller to pay attention to me and ship me my Microsoft 2007 Office Professional. My credit card has already been debited. I have sent emails and no resolve. This is very disheartening.
3,Good old office but BAD new look,I love all the Microsoft applications however with the new layout it is much harder to use and navigate. The 2002 version with drop down lists works so much better. This new version has lots of toolbars with icons to click. That I Hate.
1,Did not receive! Cancelled credit card charge,"I ordered this software and received an email that it was shipped. The tracking number given did not work. I emailed the company on two occasions and received no answer. After a month past the due date of shipment, cancelled the credit card charge."
1,non working,"The product would not install. ""Setup cannot find Standarddr .ww\office64ww.msi"", setup needs this file to install."
2,I STILL don't like the UI changes in Office 2007 (the RIBBON etc.),"When the user-interface changed in OFFICE 2007, I hated it. And folks said, It will make sense after while .. Well, Ive been using the ""ribbon"" for several years, and I still hate it. It may indeed have some logical organization, but if you need to find anything from a perspective other than that organization, I just find it very confusing. I think this is probably related to the design trade-off of designing for the ""newbie"" versus ""power user"" .. a UI that is good for one is usually not good for the other. I don't know .. I just have never gotten used to the OFFICE 2007 layout."
1,Horrible Experience,Worst experience. Received order 25 days after ordering. Sent 2 emails before receiving shipment with no response from Seller.Item sent was not item purchased. The software program is an illegal copy. Also marked for International use only not US.Should have checked prior comments on Seller -- would have looked elsewhere.
2,Mildly interesting,"I expected big things from this book after reading a glowingreview in the San Jose Mercury News. It was supposed to be acautionary tale on 80's greed, about how a good guy gets caughtup in financial roulette. It didn't read that way to me. Thebusiness transactions seemed pretty routine for your averageentrepreneur. I'm not sure the main character is really all that good of a guy.And the ending felt anti-climatic to me. I was like:""Is that it?"" The author does build up some interesting charactersand some interesting situations, and she can write some vividscenes, but I felt generally disappointed when I finished readingit."
2,What a Waste!,"How is it that a really excellent writer like Jane Smiley who can create numerous interesting characters can write such an incredibly boring book? I read all 417 pages, hoping against hope that it would not turn out to be as I feared, ""all wind up and no pitch."" But indeed, that is exactly what it was. So many details... Oh, my God. Did I care on page 379 that Joe ate a ham sandwich and tomato soup for dinner? No.Some really good scenes. Way too much descriptive sex. Repetitious drives to the same old places.Don't bother."
3,Fair,"Pros - Readable. Has a ""Definitely Could Have Happened"" plot and general feel (and probably did, and probably still does). Doesn't get too bogged down in too many characters, ridiculous settings, etc.Cons- Plows through in the middle section, unless you are really interested in real estate selling in the 80s (or now). Could have snipped 100 pages off of Joe's turn to the dark side. Pretty predictable as well, you have a good inclination that Joe is going to get financially screwed in the end, it's just by who and how bad.I would say it's worth the time, but I am not sure about buying a brand new copy."
3,"Old Story, Nothing New","I was rather disappointed in this tale of NYC exurbanites caught up in a small-town version of the go-go 1980s. Considering that authors ranging in quality from Tom Wolfe to John Grisham have tackled this theme, you'd think that Smiley would either offer a new take on the subject or devise irresistible characters. She doesn't. The book is well-written, at least."
3,"Half good questions, half uninteresting","I usually have no problem in starting a conversation, however some times I find useful the suggestion of some topics to maintain a conversation going. This books provides some interesting topics to talk about and in this sense it is useful, however it quickly loses its magic as many of the suggested questions are uninteresting or a previous question rephrases differently.A half the questions, half the price, would make it a stronger book.In net, it is useful but I would suggest to look at the price/content of other books first as I believe better value is somewhere else."
4,Good product,It does well reflecting the sun. The only minor issue I have is that it does not quite fit correctly.
4,used book,"pleased with condition of book, except there were 4 pages which had been cut out; but 'used' means used!!!!"
5,The great Presto,"This product is very well made, heat easily & cooked fast, I fried some chicken wings and it's so crispy, browny juicy."
2,Fast & Furious!,"This product cooks waaaayyy to fast!!! There is no temperature gage to slow it down (did not realize it at the time of purchase). Over cooks meats and burns fries if you turn your back. The key to using this is to let it get hot, take the gage off, fry a little and put the gage back in. Should not be. Good for boiling in a hurry!Think twice before purchasing."
5,"Great Gift, Largest Non-Commercial Fryer I Could Find.","I purchased this as a gift for my parents. They had searched several avenues with no luck in finding a large fryer. I found this on Amazon. I thought the dual fryer option was a great idea for fish fries or for appetizers. Also, if a larger portion needs to be prepared, then they could remove the divide and just utilize the entire space for their food of choice. After presenting the gift and utilizing it several times, my parents have given me nothing but rave reviews of this product. They are so pleased and happy to have their fryer back, only this time larger and capable of handling more food, saving them time when cooking and entertaining. THANKS AMAZON."
4,"The Product Works, Okay?","So, I have to gove you at least 20 words about the product...very well...It works, okay, and is a must for home brewing or winemaking, so I highly recommend that you buy yourself one, or actually two, since the glass is incredibly thin and you're gonna drop one probably sooner than later.So there, more than 20 words about the product. I have no problem with the hydrometer, which is why I gave it four stars, my beef is with Amazon Prime. I mean who do they think they're kidding? The product sells as ""Prime eligible"" from the vendor for almost eight bucks with ""free two-business-day shipping"", or from the same vendor for just over a buck, then add regular shipping for a total of just over six.Free expedited shipping??? Yeah, right...COME ON MAN!"
2,It's cheap.,"On the plus side: it works and it's cheap. On the minus side: it's fragile, the scale is a rolled up piece of paper stuck in the tube, and the ""testing container"" that comes with it, is actually the packing tube used to protect it in shipping."
2,Not what i thought it was,"Im sure its a great hydrometer , but i was unaware that it only ranges from 0-20% as such , it will not work for what i need it for"
3,I wish there was a plastic version,One drop in the sink and that was the end. I wish there was a drop-resistant version so we don't have to keep replacing. One can only buy for so long...
5,Cameron is the best! All his books are great bargains,"This the first of at least 12 of Cameron's ""Above"" books.He has set the standard for any aerial photography/coffee table books. With each new edition he finds interesting, stunningly beautiful shots-each one worthy of the ""Above San Francisco"" calendars he also publishes. With so much beauty and so many tourist sights in everyones favorite city, ""Above San Francisco"" is the way to see this unique city and the entire Bay Area."
4,"Great plot, but poor ending","Here is a book which had all the makings for a truly great novel. It has a great plot, with a very believable storyline, i.e. the origins of the Anti-Christ. I think in many respects this view of the Anti-Christ's origins is highly plausible, and I give much kudos to the author for developing it.However, the ending was very anticlimatic. Maybe the author ran out of steam towards the end. Nevertheless an interesting book to read for many individuals (Christians and non-Christians alike) who may also be students of Eschatology (the study of end-times theology)."
3,"contrived & cynical, but fun","This is a prototypical high concept thriller. When thirty year old Father Peter Carenza seemingly wields lightning in fending off a mugger in Brooklyn, he is summoned to the Vatican. There we discover that, three decades ago, forces within the Vatican secured a DNA sample from the Shroud of Turin and decided to try to clone Christ. Now their dream is approaching fruition but they quickly discover that they can not control their own creation. And when Peter's behavior starts to become somewhat odd, there's little anyone can do to stop him, not even the Vatican's own ruthless assassin.It's all exactly as contrived as it sounds, but Mr. Monteleone has fun with his premise. My main objection is that he's entirely too cynical and the portraits of religion and the religious border on bigotry. But taken on its own terms, its fairly entertaining.GRADE: C"
4,"The most respectful, truest, funniest recreation of childhoo","Shaw said that people laughed hardest when he told the simple truth. This book might have been written to illustrate the profundity of that remark, as tiny Swaminathan, so profoundly imagined that we leave the book understanding (and loving) him, enables us to feel a deep tenderness not only for him but for all children (including ourselves). Swami loves (and hustles) his mamaji, loves (and trembles, needlessly, before) his father, loves (and stoutly patronizes and instructs) his Granny, generally conducting his life in school and among his friends with an endearing combination of courage, ablomp, cheek, incomprehension, and vulnerability. Narayan is the writer that Graham Greene admires most in the English language; Swami and Friends is a goodish argument why. The book illustrates how Narayan has come to command the respect of writers and the love of readers throughout the world."
4,"""i am -used to dying.""i told him....(page 111.)","not your usual animal story. this is about a CAT(yes,a cat) reincarnated as a human female.old margaret brewster had a cat named ophelia that she loved so much,she left everything:money,house,belongings-to her cat in her will. this did not sit well with her greedy lawyer,dan dillon. after margaret died suddenly,not only did mr dillon steal margaret's priceless pewter collection,he murdered ophelia by throwing her downinto a well and drowning her but...here is the twist-at some point later, a screeching sound is heard comingfrom the well and inside is a beautiful,naked,woman(with the same green eyes as the cat(!). ophelia is caredfor by margaret's nephew,julian,in the house that is really,the cat ophelia's house!!! at first,ophelia hasdifficulty living as a human(she still thinks like a cat)but,over time,she adapts and yes,she does rememberwho killed her in her previous life. i will not spoil the end. i will only say that the end is...ironic."
3,anyone feel like a stylewhore?,"it's an excellent book (to look at and hold) with a massive amount of content. the shame is that much of the content is too 'trendy' rather than good examples of smart logos. in this it's a great 'what was going on now' resource and does have some amazing works in it but many logos are obviously made to be used only briefly for functions, products or short-term items. if you can afford it then grab it but if you're on a budget get Dos Logos instead, it's a much broader and less 'stylewhorish' collection."
4,Good books for beginners,"This book is one of the first chess books I bought for my son. He liked it instantly from the first pages he read, and he liked John Nunn's style very much, so I bough him more books by John Nunn.However this book is only for beginners, so you better check you local library instead of buying it. But if you want to buy a book on tactics, I would recommend it."
5,Salt in His Shoes,"I saw Deloris Jordan and Roslyn Jordan interviewed on one of the morning shows and was anxious to get this book and share it with my second graders. I was not disappointed. I'm always looking for real life role models to tell the kids about and Michael Jordan and his determination to achieve his dream really fit the bill. It had so many elements in it that are important for today's kids...ignoring bullies, looking to your families for support, not giving up, keeping your eye on a dream, knowing what you want in life. I hope that my students remember the lessons taught in this fine story and at least begin to learn what can be achieved."
5,The Wealth of Nations,"Crennen uses facts to prove Capitalism is the only system in the world which provides its people with freedom along with the highest standard of living. Crennen also reveals the weakness of democracy proving it does not result in a free market society. Democracy is simply ""mob rule"" where the majority can enslave the minority. Democracy does not equate to individual freedom as the socialist would like us to believe. Crennen breaks the myths created by our leaders, which say that spreading Democracy around the world will set people free. A government which sticks to Capitalism as its system of rule will provide the most for its people--a system that protects individuals from the initiation of force by other people, other groups of people and by its own government. Individual freedom is an end in itself rather than a means to some other end. Kudos to Crennen!"
5,Quality built ironing board,"This is a strudy, well built product. It was very easy to install. I did it in 15 minutes. My wife loves it.Now she has a lot more room in her sewing room. We opted to paint it, but it can be stained also.We reccommend it highly."
5,I love this thing!!!,"I did a lot of research on these before buying one. The price is the MOST reasonable I found. It mounts right to a wall (or solid wood door). Solid, sturdy construction. Looks good and works perfectly."
3,Could have been better!,"This is the second book I read of Seymour. To be honest I find his style a bit too repetitive and monotonous. The plot is good but has some gaping holes in it. It is hard to accept that a Mafia family would accept a foreigner in their midst without checking her out thoroughly. On the other habd the atmosphere of Palermo and the whole ""Cosa Nostra"" issue is very accurately depicted. It is an enjoyable and informative book, I recommend it."
5,Great little pump.,"I bought this pump for my granddaughter who designed and planted a ""Fairy Garden"". This pump works great. She installed it herself."
3,Not a great hold,"While this spray gives a slight hold, it's definitely not an effective substitute for gel/mousse. It would probably work well to control fly-aways, but it doesn't work to control all of my hair on its own. (I have very thick, curly hair.)I do like that it's light and can be used on dry hair, which is good for when my hair needs a bit of boost later in the day or the day after washing it.Also, this smells really good. It smells exactly like Skittles.I wanted a better product for the price, but maybe I had the wrong expectation for it."
2,Set it free? I tried.,"Once again, I was sadly disappointed with Deva. This spray (like the Deva Curl Mister Right), left my hair feeling sticky. I didn't see where the ""moisture"" and ""oil"" came in. It left me just wanting to go through my hair routine all over again. The smell was okay, but what's that mean if the actual product doesn't do what it's supposed to?! Sorry Deva, but I will NOT be buying this again, feels like they use some sort of ""glue"" in this. I will stick with real natural oils like jojoba and argan."
2,sticky and strange,"It is just ""okay"" in terms of results. It goes on rather sticky, and the second you use too much, your hair will feel strange - dirty - all day."
1,Cynaumon Is a Snake Oil Salesman,"I told the bookstore that they should put it in the fiction section. Cynaumon is a complete fraud, does not have a medical degree, lied about going to UCLA, has over $500,000.00 in judgments against him, is being sued by the FTC and numerous other entities, including former friends and partners. In particular, ""DrGreg"" is currently embroiled in the CortiSlim debacle with FTC and others. He is a joke and should be silenced, if not jailed. You can read more here: http://www.edresearch.com. But don't buy his books -- unless you want to read some lousy fiction."
1,"Buy ""Love and Logic"" instead","I'm the parent of a young toddler who is wonderful and happy -- largely because we used ""Love and Logic"" techniques. I would recommend ""Love and Logic"" instead. It's a much better book, and for those parents who are time-crunched (Who isn't these day?), there are CD's and DVD's available."
3,"Well written, but getting old","I got this book awhile back and just got it off the shelf for a refresher. I am most interested in multicast, but it says that IGMPv3 is an internet draft and the equivalent MLD doesn't exist yet. That may have been true 4 years ago when the book was published, but things have evolved since then. I think the same is true for some other areas, such as v4/v6 interop standards. This book is a decent primer and the price isn't bad, but it's old enough I'd go with something newer. I'm shopping for a replacement myself."
4,Endearing tales of intrepid adventures,"Beginning with his ride out of Delhi, India, where he felt ""as if all 8.4 million residents of that city were on the same road"" and ""bicycles are at the very bottom of the vehicle caste system,"" Willie Weir has an uncanny way of summing up situations in a few wry, descriptive sentences. His sense of humor is infectious, and usually quite ironic. Yet, he also confronts the serious isues of racisma nd discrimination in all three countries. In the Balkans, where he toured in 1996, he is constantly faced with war-torn villages, food shortages, and ethnic hatred. One particular day he eats lunch with a Muslim family, then shares dinner with a Croat one, and realizes he has the privilege of being ""able to pass back and forth between the camps without being threatened."""
3,Not what I expected,Less of an identification guide - more of a list of places to go to see wildlife. I liked it well enough to keep it but it wasn't what I expected.
3,Died after 3 years,"I purchased this fan about 3 years, we used to love it since it is style and quiet. However it is died in this summer, the oscillation is not working. Hope it will stay longer, so disappointed."
2,Lasko 4822,"Purchased this fan last summer, about 9 months ago (although not from Amazon). This morning it just stopped. It's not full of dust or other gunk that would cause the motor to die. Controls work like normal, fan still oscillates, but just doesn't blow any air. I've been a Lasko consumer for years and have had other Lasko fans that lasted for years, but I'm very disappointed in this one."
2,Great at first...then both konked within days of each other,"I bought two of these fans and they worked great for a year. Then one stopped responding to the remote. It still runs, but only manually. The other, which was used rarely, started beeping when you turned it on and would not stop. Finally, kicked that one to the curb. Loved the fans...if they would have kept working."
1,not good,"The picture does not match what was delivered ""at all""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!its a different version and it almost looks like a knockoff to me.. I would have sent it back had I known but I was out of state at the time. I own the one pictured that I bought at Sams Club so I ordered one for my Mother from this ad which she received. I was shocked to discover it IS NOT the unit pictured above but rather some cheap chinese knockoff of it. My sams club unit is of much better quality than this thing and it was the same price. I really confused by this because its branded lasko but it's really much cheaper , has a silver finish that looks painted on unevenly instead of molded in, buttons that dont work at times, ill fitting joinery, and the fan is NOISY. not at all like the dead silent lasko 4820 I bought from sams that Ive had for a year now and is still dead silent."
1,Worst book from Red Dress Ink,"Wow...I don't even know where to begin. First, I finished this book because I have a long commute, so I had time to spare. However, this book was one of the worst books that I've ever read. The plot goes nowhere and new characters are continously introduced - none of which are well developed or make the book interesting. The author often brings up that a character has this ""secret"" but never tells us what it is. It was a terrible book. I wouldn't recommend it. I'm surprised because the Red Dress Ink novels are usually great. This one was terrible."
4,Good flash,"I have been using this flash for couple of years. It is a real work horse. Like other flashes in this time period, it makes high pitch noise as it recharges.The shoe mount voltage is enough to fry the modern digital body - you would either need a shoe mount adapter or remote trigger. I use two flashes using cactus 4 remote trigger."
1,false advertisement,"The reason I selected this merchandise because of one of the images that shows the vivitar kit, and I thought the whole kit was included for that price. So if its not included that image that shows the entire kit needs to be removed, so other customers will not get burned. This is why it is false advertisement."
1,Sent used book instead of new.,I paid for a new book but was sent an old used book with markings in it and even labeled used on the back cover. Amazon was kind enough to refund my money after I told them of the issue. The book cannot be judged by its cover either as the inside is not that good in the way of photos. Look elsewhere for a Tuscan book.
4,"Nice look, Nice chair","I am a certified Jeeper. If there is jeep memorabilia I just have to have it, especially when I was decorating my new home office. The last item I needed to make my office complete was a new chair. I purchased the Jeep chair (black) and it is just perfect in the room and very, very comfortable. I can sit there for hours on my computer and get a lot of work done as it is so comfortable I don't even think about comfort, my mind is on work. A good buy! I recommend it!"
1,Ben Weider's,"What shocked me above all, reading this book was the complete lack of objectivity manifested by the author. It seems Napoleon can do no wrong and this is emphasized by the constant need for the author to justify the Emperor's actions, by way of asking rather childish questions and making easy assertions, bordering on sophism. The overall feeling we get is Mr. Weider's need for historical ""revenge"" and the need to clean Napoleon's name. The autor wants to make us see Napoleon as a martyr, a man who was not a conqueror and made war out of strict necessity. This book is neither intended for neophytes, as it glances too rapidly over key historical moments, nor is it intended for experts, because of its biaised approach to the main protagonist and simplistic approach to events. The writing style is dry, almost newspaper-like and fails to carry the reader. Finally, although Mr. Weider theory of assassination is interesting, recent discoveries have discarted his theory. Overall, a deception."
4,A web page design ideas book,"I own Navigation Vol.1, so I knew what I was getting with Vol.2. The book gives no tips on how to design a site but instead is full of screenshots of a selection of sites showing the different interfaces out there. Not quite as good as Navigation Vol.1 but still v. useful to come up with ideas for page design."
5,Compelling!,This was a very good book. You definitely feel the sadness that this little girl had faced. I don't usually like narrative poems but this one is an exception. I highly recommend it.
2,Cheap Pan at a premium price,"This pan warps at temperatures above 450 degrees and the anondized finish has begun to peel off after less than ten uses.If this roaster was priced at $25 it would be a good buy. It is way overpriced at $59.95.Spend an extra $50 and get the Calphalon stainless steel Tri-ply-roaster----it is the real deal.Dale GarnerAtlanta, Ga"
5,Well worth the money!,My grandchildren's sand/play area was being nightly soiled by a neighborhood cat. The cat was climbing over their 6 ft. privacy fence at that! My husband installed the ANIMAL AWAY low on the fence right beside the area of the sandbox. Haven't seen a sign of the cat since! Would definitely recommend this product.
2,Doesn't keep cats away,"Maybe cats are very light on their feet, but Animal Away does nothing to keep them away from my fish pond area. The warning light doesn't even go on when the cats enter the ""protected"" area and one of them weights 22lbs. The only time I've seen the device activate is when I step into the area. Since I don't stay up all night watching for raccoons, I don't know if it keeps them away, but I doubt it does. I would say this product is a waste of money unless you're using it to scare off something bigger than a 22lb. cat."
2,Didn't work for us.......,"I really like the way this was put together and the motion coverage seemed to work well, but the sounder did nothing to keep my dog away from the top of the stairs. We noticed his ears move when we turned it on or off, but when he triggered it, nothing. Like it wasn't even there."
5,I am enjoying the subversive extremes.,"As a poet, Brian Fawcett seeks to understand life in the way that grasps all that is out there. He is only a bit older than I am, so it is easy for me to sympathize with his regret that we are in an underworld, destroying so many things that might be appreciated by those who are yet to be born. Like animals that have become extinct, institutions engaging in regimentation for uniformity attempt to impose a herd morality fitting into a scheme of increasing complexity, but the fundamental flaws in marginal thinking cannot sustain what it was never possible to become. This book is an opportunity for others to join in the way I hate myself for saying things that other people never think."
4,Nice retro toon,"Boxes are in French only (panic!) but menu allows English dubbing. It's a cartoon but has an adult, or maybe that's a retro, feel. For example, the Captain drinks a bit. Still a nice series of morality tales--Tin Tin treads the high road!"
4,I Spy,I remember the TV series and the adlibing between Cosby and Culp. It still works 30/40 years later. Excellent if you like some of the quality older shows.
3,Not much re-playability,"Don't get me wrong. This game is good. But, after you run through it for a few hours, it kind of gets boring. You get to hear Regis say the same things over and over, and you start to lose interest. The good thing is that the game is relativly inexpensive."
1,Worse than the first,"Anybody who says this game is an improvement over the first one must have got a different copy than me. The difficulty level of the questions is TOTALLY OUT OF ORDER! Don't believe me? Sample $200 Question: What force would cause the ice cream to spin off the cone while on a twirling merry-go-round? Sample $300 Question: What biological process replicates DNA. They're not impossible to answer, but it's very annoying to get them so early on. Any die hard fan of the show (like me) knows that questions like that would never be asked that soon into the game. On the plus side, Regis, the graphics and the music are all first rate. It's just a shame that programmers couldn't get the questions right, again."
4,Fun game at a great price!,"I didn't buy the first game based upon the reviews I read here. Most reviewers spoke highly of the second edition so I couldn't pass it up. I'm glad I did! The game installed without a hitch. The graphics are pretty good and the sound is great! I did about as good on the game as I do watching the show so I guess it's a ""realistic"" experience! Best of all, the price is right. I've paid a good deal more for games not half as entertaining. Go ahead - you know you want it!"
4,Interesting study of a intense word.,"I thought this was a good book. I'm a curious, Southern, white, educated individual with modern thinking who was always curious on this subject. Unfortunately, it is such a antagonistic subject, I couldn't really quell any curiosity. It covered a lot of bases and was good chewing material. It gives some insight into the plight of Black America. The only thing I didn't like was about 1/4 of the content was footnote references. I don't think this is a re-reader, but good pretty good the first time."
2,Rehash of old work.,"I expected a good book based on all the reviews, but instead Ifound a compilation of past instances of the word nigger as insult.I did not find a root of the word, nor a beginning, nor an ending forthe word nigger. It was well researched, put together and marketed,but so was Studebaker. I cannot recommend it if you wish to learnabout the word. If you just wish to have something to talk about,read it . Takes about one hour."
1,"Easier than manual mincing, not durable at all.","Not a very durable product. When it was intact, it was great, but the metal actually *snapped in 2* on both sides of the hopper at the hinge.This item is not recommended at all."
2,"Not recommended, stick with the Zyliss","I bought this based on the recommendation from Cooks Illustrated to replace my trusty Zyliss press. With the Zyliss, you can press the garlic with the skin on and it is easy to clean. The self-cleaner on this one gets all gunked up and you need to peel the garlic first. Skip this press and get the Zyliss."
3,Not as functional...,Trudeau garlic press is not as functional as I expected. I was replacing an OXO press. The Trudeau is heavier and less well-balanced to hold than the OXO. I found pressing garlic required more effort and hand strength. Also the Trudeau didn't self-clean easily.
1,Poorly Machined and Dangerous,"The press holes are poorly machined, left rough burrs that will fall out over time, into the pressed garlic. They may cause broken teeth or harm the digestive tract if swallowed. These holes will be difficult to keep clean.The hinge pin is carbon steel and will rust. It is also poor fitted.I returned it for credit."
2,Great....Until it Broke,"I'm not the first person to make this complaint. The press was fantastic. I used it many times, often squeezing two cloves at once. It worked perfectly. I did notice a bit of the ""self cleaning"" part popping off, but it didn't seem to become any bigger of a gap so I left it. One day I was in the kitchen getting ready to squeeze some garlic, I put the cloves inside and began to squeeze. There was a pop and the hinge had completely snapped in half. There's no fixing the sucker. I had it and used it fairly regularly for six months or so. I don't recommend it."
5,GREAT,"Easy to use, easy to clean, works much better than any press I've ever had, sturdy and should last a long time."
5,The Garlic Press I've beenlooking for,"Trudeau Garlic Press is super strong, easy to grip, doesn't cramp my wrists, makes for nice sized mince.Easy to clean. Simple hardware design and construction. Other models have moving joints and parts that garlic get stuck in. I think the Trudeau is built to do the job and to last a long time. Not break like my last plastic handle press that broke after being used only 3 times."
4,Everyone should have one,"The Trudeau garlic press is sturdy, easy to use and easy to clean. I don't have any complaints."
5,Trudeau Garlic Press,For the money this press is a great deal!!! It does what it is advertised to do. Clean up is a breeze and you can fit 2-3 nice sized cloves in the cavity. very solid feel to this item. I threw out the cheap aluminum one I had which I purchased from the super market. I''ll be using more garlic in my recipes now. Thanks Trudeau for a great product and thank you Amazon for great customer service.
1,broke during 1st use,The plastic part that pushes the garlic peel out of the press stuck in the press itself and snapped off the first time we used it.
1,"heavy, hard to use","I purchased this product based on the Cooks' Illustrated review. I really dislike it. Sometimes I have to use two hands to squeeze the garlic. It is very heavy. My old press was lighter and easy to press, but the finish was damaged by washing it in the dishwasher. I miss it. I dislike this press enough that I will likely buy a new one and donate this one to good will. I have owned it for about 1 year. Aside from the teeth on the back of the press allowing for easier cleaning I don't see what there is to like about this press."
1,It's used - Thanks Amazon,Bought new directly from Amazon and the garlic press I received was clearly used and returned. Yuck!
4,"very engrossing, very well written, most enjoyable","2d in a series, this is a good stand alone book also. I have really enjoyed this and its predecessor (Shinju) and its followup (The Way of The Traitor). I hope #4 is not far off."
5,Best Project Managing Software,This software made it so easy to track finances and projects/tasks at work. It has very adaptable tool functions.
1,Unable to install,"I could not even install MS Project. I keep getting some cryptic error message box informing me that MS Project 2007 is not compatible with Office 2007. Never mind that I don't even have Office 2007 installed. Actually, I SHOULD know better. Even if they are FREE, Microsoft garbage/bloatware is seldom worth the trouble--move on."
5,My daughter loves these stories,"There was a time where trying to get my middle daughter to read was like trying to herd cats. Then she brought this book home from the school library. I didn't have to nag her once to finish it, she poured through it from cover to cover. She liked it because it was funny and captured her interest.Well, I was sold. I bought this book and Volume II and it was the beginning of the turn around. They helped to inspire the love of reading I was hoping for with my daughter, and now she willingly reads a wider variety of books."
5,Great book - in depth,"This book was great. It did not just scratch the surface like most books, but it went into depth where it was needed. This is the book to have for .NET Security."
2,Waste of money,Bought this for my 9 year old son. We followed the directions and got a mess. Not at all what is in the description. He was very disappointed as was I.
3,"works on some nails, but not dark ones","I found the light a little helpful for the white/clear nails on my dog. However, 4 of my dogs nails are black, and the light did not show through them at all. So, if your dog has dark nails, the light will not be of much use at all. The clipper was powerful and cut through my dog's really tough nails."
4,The House of Rothschild,"Ferguson insults the purchaser of the Penguin Paperback by omitting the bibliography and only providing sketchy footnotes. ""Serious scholars"" who desire these items are advised to buy the Harcover edition. Other than that, it is a good read"
3,Not as good as the first; a worthy read still,"The second volume of the family saga is not as compelling as the first. Perhaps that is due to the length of time covered, or perhaps due to the relative decline of the Rothschilds in the world of finance. Still, this is a compelling story, which is skillfully narrated by Mr.Ferguson"
2,Part I is Much More Interesting,"The last two chapters of this book zing along like the first part, ""Money's Prophets."" That volume was fascinating for the way it made financial history a story of personalities and social trends. This volume gets bogged down in the middle in British political history. You learn in excruciating detail about the Rothschild's involvement with Liberal and Tory politicians. But their social role gets buried."
1,The liquid white willow is so much better,"This will cause ringing in the ears, but it does work. The liquid is so much more better and safer."
5,tiny little power house,"I have used the camera non stop since buying it. With the power to take 12 MP photos that I convert to etching plates and print from to just everyday photos. The video feature works really well which surprised me. I bought it for the ease of packing a camera around everyday, for work and play and it has preformed beyond expectations. Lots of nifty features in the scene mode that I have yet to truely figure out if they are useful."
4,Handy little camera,My ideal Rating will be 4.5Pros:1) Very small and lightweight2) Wide angle3) Lens4) Color reproduction5) Scene modes6) Easy controls7) Bigger CCDCons:1) Noise2) Battery latch is flimsy3) Initial startup time.
3,"Not as good as Wigwam, but.............","Looking to replace the Wigwam ""Moraine"" sock (cotton/wool), but it seems it is not being made anymore. Why Wigwam would not make this GREAT sock is beyond me......so settled for the Fox River....not as good a sock, but ok...just doesn't have the same wonderful fit/feel as the Wigwam....and it tends to pill updespite careful washing....they shrink despite air drying.....Wigwam people, ARE YOU READING THIS????Ok if you are desparate for a cotton/wool ragg sock......buy a bigger size than you normally wear!"
4,If you like Lorre,"This is far from Lorre's best and certainly a predictable storyline, but as an old movie collector I wanted it.Unlike some I have bought, I actually watched this through till the end.Look for Charles Middleton- Ming the Merciless and Don Bledsoe, two great character actors"
3,Not worth buying if you own the original,"Mo'Nique is one of my favorite comedians but this ""Deluxe Edition"" of her platinum comedy series dvd is not worth buying if you already own the original. The second disc is just an audio cd version of the show. If you own the original, then these ""Deluxe Editions"" of the Platinum Comedy Series dvd are not worth re-buying."
3,Just a little bulkier than I wanted,"For the longest time I used the Umbra Bungee Card Case as a wallet.It was great, conveniently sized and held almost everything I needed.However, it did not hold any cash and broke every year. So when shopping for a new one I tried this.It was ok, it held all my cards and my cash. However, I found three major faults.1. It was bulkier than the Umbra2. It didn't hold very much3. It was uglyHowever, I could see it being very useful for a secondary wallet. One you only took out when you jogged or took to a big event, like a sports game."
3,It's okay.,"In 22 days I will have had my jimi for one year. I can tell you that it is waterproof. If you were going to a water park I would recommend taking this wallet with you. Just make sure it completely locked in the closed position. The con to this wallet is the cash space. It can fit 3-4 bills at best. Make sure you spend an entire 20 because the change won't fit. Fortuneatly almost everything takes plastic of which this wallet holds 4 cards comfortably. The jimi is not meant for everyday use. After 6 months of traveling in my back pocket, it has some issues staying closed. I should have expected that being that it is made of plastic. However, I'm the type of person that will use something until the very end so I still have it in my back pocket."
4,"Impressive, simple, great replacement for fat wallet","This wallet is a fantastic value. It's obvious there's some engineering behind it. The seams snap shut securely, the plastic hinge is made for longevity, and the inner card holder works great.I've had this wallet for over six months, overstuff it, and it has no signs of breaking. Wear is light at this point and not noticeable. I don't understand the negative reviews that report this as flimsy.It seems to be waterproof too. I got it in black, so it does just fine in a business settings.The only downside is that the plastic used seems cheap, even if it is durable. I'd rather pay a few dollars more and get something of higher quality."
1,awful stuff,"Just received the black wallet, and completely unsatisfied with the purchase. The quality of plastic is very low - it looks and feels like very cheap piece of production and there are scratches after only a couple of minutes of wearing the wallet."
2,Disappointed...,"After reading a number of books regarding women who served in the Vietnam War, I was anxious to read this book as well. I expected more personal stories, perhaps a synopsis of the interviews of each of the 50 nurses studied. And the word ""studied"" is where my main problem with the book lies. It's written like a research paper or dissertation...I was unable to connect with any of the women on a personal or emotional level. I found myself paging ahead, hoping it would get interesting, but unfortunately, it never did. I much prefered ""Women in Vietnam"" by Ron Steinman or ""A Piece of My Heart""."
1,It lasted for a few months then fell apart,"The connector area fell apart after a few months of use. Had to duct tape it up. It last me a bit longer then it moved away to a local landfill or to somewhere in china, or an electronic recycling center where something happens, but I don't really know what."
3,Cute idea but needs color coding,"This book accompanies child handbell sets. It's a very cute idea. However, unless the child can actually read music (a skill usually learned a lot later, if at all in these days of cutting music in our schools, but that's another matter!), it will be difficult to use. We think we're going to color the notes so that they match the bells. The songs are standard children's songs."
4,great for the money,"got a little rain and the tent performed very well even without the sides staked out. windows in the rain fly are an interesting feature but also unwanted when you are with a large group of people and go inside the tent to change clothes. also, the vestibules are nice but too small. impossible to get inside vestibule and turn around to zip it then enter tent. you end up having to unzip the vestibule and then the tent which lets the rain in. also the way the zipper goes straight down makes it a squeeze to get into the vestibule. would be better with a curved zipper making a doorway. my tent came with aluminum poles even though the specs said fiberglass so that was a pleasant surprise. for the price this thing is well worth it and fine for the 5 or so nights a year i camp out"
4,great cd,"you dont want to miss out on this one, its a blessed album. The songs are off the hook, ""didnt i"" takes the cake, love it!"
4,good value,"These filters are basically all the same and the all last about 3 weeks with my well water. The prices have gone up 200% in the last 8 years. I try to find them at the lowest cost, and one of the largest online filter sellers really screwed up an order so I buy them here now. These were the best deal at the time."
4,"If you're REALLY into them, get it.","I love it, because I'm REALLY into Ben Folds Five plus I like Sarah McLachlan a lot. It doesn't spend a ton of time on BF5, but it's pretty cool to see & hear the guys themselves as opposed to reading the transcripts. The performance is OK, but again I wouldn't get it unless you're a pretty devoted fan & in that case I highly recommend."
3,Radio/Tape Player,"I like the radio/cassette player very much. The volume and radio station channel changers are a little hard to use. I use the radio during the night and make my changes in the dark, so the radio operation is important to m."
1,Very Poor Customer Service.,"We just bought this drive. Brand new. Plugged it in to our server and the drive was read only! What is point to a USB drive that is read only? When we tried to change the permissions - the Administrator was denied. We called Iomega, who suggested we purchase the full version of folder share at foldershare.com and install their BETA version active-X on our production server. (Like that is going to happen) Finally the support personnel informed us that we needed to pay another $25.00 if we want more help. (Pay 25.00 for support on a new USB drive?) So we opted to return the drive back to the store and buy a Maxtor instead."
1,Nice Doorstop,"This drive worked just great -- for about three months. It spent most of its time turned off as I only turned it on when I wanted to back something up. Lucky for me, I've adopted the habit of backing up not only to a hard drive (for quick access) but also to DVDs. After about three months, this turkey disappeared from my computer and has yet to allow itself to be located. Customer service -- a joke. I'm amazed that companies that treat their customers so poorly continue to stay around. I'm sending this piece of junk back to iomega. (The one star is for its admirable duty as a doorstop.)"
4,Iomega install & operation review,Hardware and CD/Software are easy to install. Hardware is hefty and appears to be high quality. I've hade the unit installed a month with no problems other than lonf directory structures. Backup operations are simple to execute. There seems to be a proplem with backing up files with a long directory tree/path. You can't have an extremely long file directory.
3,Tutorial Good. Age Bad. Covers out of date version.,"Alas, the hazards of bound books. Note that this was published in 2001. It covers JDK 1.3, also known as Java 2. The current revision is JDK 5 (which would be 1.5 if they kept the old naming conventions, I think).That said,it should be sufficient for a lot of folks - but likely frustrating if you have the latest releases of software, since all the detailed commands will have changed (along with some of the function calls...).Sun keeps up to date copies (downloadable) on line of all these tutorials, so I'd suggest going there first, although having two disparate copies on the go may be more trouble than it's worth, and you may end up ignoring the print version in favor of the on-line. Me, I'm keeping these for reference and have gone out and bought up to date books from other publishers."
1,Awful smelling briefcase,"When I received this briefcase and took it out of the plastic it stunk really bad. It was so bad I had to put it outside and threw it in the trash. I have purchased several items from Amazon and was happy with them but this one they should be ashamed to sell.Thanks,Car 8"
2,Brief case,A did not have this brief case a week before the inside lining sepated from the partition.
3,Poor Quality,I purchased this item in September and already the stitching from the patchwork in back are coming apart. The briefcase has lots of compartment space and actually a steal for the price.
5,Right on the Nail,"I found Lament of an Ocean to be a wonderfully informative read. I approached the book out of necessity for a project, and was overjoyed by it's clarity, depth of detail and clever presentation on the Fishery crisis in the North Atlantic. I feel Harris's book brought me up to speed (and beyond) on the subject, in a manner that I found to be pleasantly unbiased."
1,do not buy,the sweater fell apart within a week of a 1 lb dog wearing it. I would like my money back but I threw it away!
1,Do not buy anything from her.,"GrandMother Drum: Awakening the Global HeartI would not buy anything this person is selling. She is misrepresenting the Native American culture and completely disrespecting Native Americans. There are many resources to learn about the true Native American culture. You must be aware that there are many people out there that will tell you anything you want to hear to take your money. She only makes whites and others that are not Native American, who really want to learn look foolish. It is respectful to want to learn their culture in an honorable way. This is not the way she is teaching the Native American culture. Buyer beware is the advice I would have before you purchase anything from her."
2,"Pretty, but snags","I bought this item several years ago now, and although I have a serious Belle obsession, this piece was not used for long.The dress and hair cause a point and depending on which way they are pointing, can snag on clothing or even worse, scratch children. I worked in childcare at the time and left a nice scratch on a 9 month old baby I was watching. It is beautiful though, and I take it off and put it back on the bracelet when I want to wear it for certain events but even that becomes a hassle sometimes.Good quality but maybe not worth it depending on atmosphere."
2,Disappointing.,"This is a mixed bag. Some country, some blues, some jazz. Some written by Bonnie, some by others. Ultimate problem is poor sound. I understand that the album ""Beginnings"" recorded in 1969 has marginal sound, but why this one apparently done in 2006? For better sound and more uniform quality of music, try ""With You On My Side"" or ""Visual Voice"". Pity, to have waited so long, hoping for more from Bonnie, and in a way rewarded with anything at all. But this is a disappointment."
1,Very poorly made,"I have been using this since July, it is now November and the rod just broke. It lost its tension and when my husband took it down to see what was wrong we saw that the screw inside cracked in half. It's no surprise since the screw is made of plastic! Very disappointed, and amazon won't let me return or replace with a new one because the return window has expired. Do not buy this product!"
1,What a waste of money,"I don't know what book the Wisconson reader was reviewing, but it couldn't have been this book. It is a must for Led Zeppelin fans, must not buy. It does not go very deep into anything. How deep can you go with a book that's only 96 small pages, half of which are pictures. I didn't know a whole lot about Zeppelin's background to begin with, that's why I bought the book, and after reading it, which took about 10 minutes, I still don't know much about Zeppelin's background. I could have written a more informative book with the little I did know about them. The bulk of the book is just the author telling us how great Led Zeppelin was, which we already knew to begin with. If you want to read something more substantive, I can recommend ""Led Zeppelin: In their own words"", the other book I bought."
4,Plug and play,"When my previous keyboard broke, I needed to buy a new one ASAP and I didn't have much money to purchase a better one. So, when this came up on my search results, I took a closer look at it and read some reviews. After I was satisfied with what I saw, I went ahead and bought this budget keyboard. It's actually not so bad. It may not have shortcut keys like my last one did with Mail, Internet, and Volume, but it worked well enough for my needs. The keys are slightly quieter and don't ""click"" as much when I press them. This also works on my Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii consoles. Just plug it into one of the USB slots and it'll start working instantly.I've had this since late March of 2009 and I've had absolutely no problems with it since then."
5,Best quality and best service.,"Best quality and best service. According to the ad, I can get a amazon gift card after my first item I bought months ago. Why have not I receive the gift card? Thanks!"
5,It just works,"I think it's a great keyboard for $10. It works very well so far, and I use it many hours a day."
4,Good keyboard,This is a simple keyboard not complicated very easy to use just plug it in to your computer and you are ready to go. I like the way the keys are set up they don't stick at all you don't have to press very hard to type light touch works really well. And the price is great if you are looking for a no nonsense keyboard for your computer and don't want to spend a whole lot of money on one then this is the one for you it's made by Logitech and it's at a great price check it out you won't be sorry.
2,Not what I Expected,"The first thing I noticed about this particular water bottle is that it is smaller than others I've purchased. And not only is the water bottle itself smaller, so are the attachments which makes some of the usages down right awkward. The quality is okay but the size is what really threw me. This is sort of a petite version of the standard size water bottle set. I was not happy with that at all as it doesn't really work for me."
5,Perfect,"It's amazing that this timeless item is not available in any drug store within a 30 mile radius unless one chooses to visit a medical supply store and pay three times the price. This item was packaged perfectly and totally private, plus the condition was superb. The best thing about this was twofold: 1) Was delivered within 48 hours of ordering and 2) was priced perfectly at $9.99 plus shipping. If this is what you're looking for I highly suggest using this seller."
2,Portable but It has some flaws,"Portable, and convenient to take it to places.There is a flaw on the tube. It's like a cheap garden hose, bends, breaks, effects the water flow; and you can imagine the rest. Attachments are easy to clean."
4,enama bag,"Needed this item, found it only on amazon, small town here. Most works ok, the clamp is junk. came on time."
1,Fly Tying: the life cycle of the Caddis fly,"Both, the initial purchase and the replacement were mislabeled. The cover claims to be about the life cycle of the Caddis but the contents show how to tie May Flies. Very annoying to have to return to the post office twice to return the same error. I rated it one star because the program wouldn't allow me to comment without rating it. If it were possible I would rate it a MOON [but not of the celestial variety!]. Incidentally, the contents on tying May Flies is very helpful (but I already had that video)."
4,Good general guide,"Rock Climbing Arizona, like most Falcon guidebooks is a good general guidebook. It documents most of the many climbing areas in the state, and has pretty good descriptions of many of the classic routes. It also covers some areas that were previously undocumented. This guide is the perfect book for someone who is traveling through the state and wants to explore some new areas. It does lack many details and routes, so most climbers will probably end up purchasing other guidebooks for select areas.Dancing on the Edge of an Endangered Planet"
1,poor poor design,After having this adapter for about a month it all of a sudden stopped working. The only way i could get it to work was by twisting and holding the cable going into the network adapter. Turns out the little cables inside had pulled out of their plugs making the device useless. I would def recommend another USB adapter that has a seperate standard USB cable attached between the adapter and the computer. Don't waste your money. It also tries to install software that is not really necessary for the adapter to work. All the software tells you (even though its a pretty big program) is if you have an internet connection or not.
4,"Good, but. . . .","Age of Mythology is a great game, I've had it for 2 days now and am really enjoying it, but. . . The game desperatly needs more dieties and civilizations. I'm sure there will be an expansion with Asian, and South American civilizations, but I can hardly wait for it.AoM is a great start, but I shouldn't be wanting more the first weekend.That said, the game is intuitive to learn, and far more compelling than AoE or AoK. The conquests move quickly, and the dieties add a fantastic element. I really enjoyed going into the underworld.I just can't wait for more. I guess that officially makes me a power gamer."
3,JWVHIII,"When I bought Microsoft Publisher 2007, I had hoped to get a feature that was in an earlier (1995?) version of Publisher or Word that rated the level of the document written as ""High School"", ""College"", etc. and suggested editing directions. Unfortunately that feature is not part of Publisher 2007 and I am not all together sure what I will be able to use it as I wrote my first book with all the normal book items, like table of contents, chapter titles, etc, already in it. I will know more when I get time to learn the ins and outs of Pub 2007."
5,A must have,Makes business a snap! I use this all the the for invoices and more well worth the money
4,newsletter,This is an excellent product for producing a newsletter. My only complaint centers around the need for a download to produce a PDF document. Adobe is a standard in publishing and the ability to create a PDF file should be built-in and automatic.
3,"Program is Great, Unfortunately my copy was damaged in shipping.","I am pleased with the companies notification to me that my copy was damaged in shipping. Unfortunately, they did not have a replacement for me. They were very prompt in informing me of the ""BAD"" news. I had downloaded a trial version from microsoft to ""test drive"" the program and it works great. Thanks."
2,"Good software, poor packaging","I decided to update my ancient version of Publisher with the latest (2007) version. I use it for newsletters, and home projects. The 2007 Publisher version is easy to use, and the results are very good. I rate the software a 4 stars.However, the packaging is a problem. The first thing I noticed was a rattle sound. Once I figured how to get the plastic box opened I discovered the plastic piece that holds the CD in place was broken. This allowed the CD to bounce around inside the case like a marble in a cup.Next, the product code label is glued to the case. However, the label had a crease in it which obscured one of the digits, so I had to guess at it. The program installed okay, so I guessed right. Poor quality control for sure.Based on the poor packaging, I have to give the product a 2 star rating."
5,Who let this book go out of print?!!,"Who understands publishers? Just because a guy is no longer alive doesn't mean his words were worthless. With so many badly designed products on the market today, you would think a book like this one, which gives the designer a fighting chance of realising an excellent product, would be in multiple reprints. If you can find a copy of this book, make it your own. This book tells you how products SHOULD be designed. Better still, badger Amazon and the publishers (Addison Wesley - who should know better!) until they reprint it. Pugh's memory deserves the credit, even if the great man is no longer with us."
3,"good filter, bad gasket","The filter appears to be good quality, but the gasket is made of cork. Cork gaskets are much more likely to leak and rot, so I would recommend finding a set with a rubber gasket. I will probably just end up making a gasket with RTV.Also, if you have a 2wd truck you can replace the filter and pan with this filter and a 4wd pan to gain some extra capacity and a deeper sump."
3,Not fully complete,"This book is not fully complete for an experienced and matured programmer. However , for a starter it gives some idea."
4,VAMPEGEDDON IS AWESOME,"I had no idea what this movie would be like, my roomate suggested it because im a sucker for vampires, i got together w/some freinds and we watched this movie, it was awesome we had a great time being entertained, Movie starts of with a girl who wants to leave the small town she hates living in, she decides to conjure up some ancient vampires (HAMMER STYLE) And the party begins, i am not very good at explaining movies but , the vampires are bitchin , the chicks are sexy and kick ass, and the gore was good. overall this is a fun flick i reccomend to anyone who love vampires like me."
2,not a polisher,"This item is specific for bowling ball carrier and polishing.It is a carrier but not for polishing. The material is very tuff, and does not polish the ball."
5,Perfect for Any Level Bowler,Purchased this for my son-in-law because it is something a bowler could use but most likely wouldn't spend the money on. He loves it!
3,Nothing Really Outstanding But Not Bad Neither,"I originally purchased it for mental alertness and physically energy red ginseng creates. However, I did not really experience improvement in mood nor physical & mental energy. I will try differend brand."
4,A great review of a great career of a great bad.,"This video is great (bet you cold not have guessed I'd say that). It chronical FNMs transition from a raw, young rock band who could make great music, ie. ""Epic"" and ""We Care A Lot"" throught to a sophistacated musical group who put on a great live show and had the most original film clips. Patton is am excellent lyricist which he showed especially in his latter works. For me Faith No More were the best rock-ballad (""Take This Bottle"" [not on the video[) and cover band (""Easy"", ""I Started A Joke"" etc) around. It's a pity they are gone. They had come a long way as this video will show."
5,Quickcam winner,This camera worked out very well due to its small size and portability. Even though the picture omits the mounting mechanism it still fit the bill.The hinged clip is a much preferred method over the flexible style because it holds its position with less effort and doesn't appear destined to break over time.
2,Cheapie little camera,"If you are looking for an expensive webcam, search some more...This Quickcam does not look like the picture (see the customer image instead), is cheaply made and is not very functional either. It will not stay on the base = hassle, especially if you want to use it with a laptop. The set up took some figuring out. The manual (even though it comes in 16 languages!) is not intuitive/detailed enough. The image quality is just OK. I have seen better since (other Skype users) and wish I bought something else..."
3,Item received not as pictured online.,"The camera I received was not the one pictured online. I purposely ordered a model that came with a stand rather than one that clips to the monitor, but that's what I got instead. I decided to give it a try anyway. First, I found it difficult to get the camera to stay where I wanted it to since I just sits on top of the monitor - there's no way to affix it firmly in place and the weight of the usb cable tends to pull it down. Also, the video it created was very choppy and out of sync with the sound. The model I ordered was supposed to take video at 30fps - I do not know if the camera I received had that capture rate or not. Regardless, it was unacceptable. I boxed it up and sent it back."
4,Works Really Well!,"This product does exactly what it says it will. The picture quality isn't fantastic, but the sound is really great, and it all works together well. If you're looking for a reasonable web-cam that you can chat with, this is a really good buy. I'm totally satisfied."
5,Great Camera,This camera was easy to setup and use right out of the box. No problems with it at all. I am able to talk to my friends in Germany and I also bought one for my inlaws who live several states away from me. I would highly recommend it to anyone and infact I have. Great product for the price! Cant beat it anywhere!
3,Good Enough,My Logitech Quickcam Messenger works. The image is a bit grainy but okay. The only problem I have is that it won't stay on the holder. There should be some kind of a built in mechanism for the camera to stay on the holder. It's very loose and there's no way to secure the camera. One move of my laptop and the camera will fall off (but the clip stays on the computer).
4,good deal for low budget,It works well as webcam for chatting. It is a good deal if you only have limited budget...
4,Logitech 961608-0403 Quickcam Messenger,"Great quality for the price. I use this to talk to my sister who lives out of town, she has an IMac. Is probably not as clear as hers but she says that it comes over very clear. Was very easy to set up and has been a lot of fun! I love it!"
3,Overall good,"I bought this camera to see my grandaughter in another city.This camera is easy to set up and easy to use. It has good picture and good sound. Friends say the view and audio are not in sinc when a video is recorded, but when haveing a live video call, there have been no complaints. It works for the needs of my small family."
3,eloping is simpler!,"This is my first foray into Kathleen Eagle's world! My rough-hewn self wanted to categorize ONCE UPON A WEDDING as a fantasy...except, this author does have a way with words, & women will drool over them.A womanly read, about articulate women well versed in relationships; unafraid to murmur awful things to each other, & make up afterwards - it is rich with textures, scents, family scenes, rueful memories & second chances at happiness, at getting it right. Will they take the plunge?"
2,BE VERY CAREFUL,"Be careful. I've spent 4 hours in 'live chat' with their technical support to make this thing work. And it won't do what I need it to do. First, be careful -- it must be plugged directly into the wall socket(it won't work plugged into a power strip) and it needs a main USB port in the back of your computer unit (front, side, or alternate USB ports won't work -- less power to alternate USB ports they said). And you have to download a 'PRO' version of the software hidden on their website in order to back-up your entire computer system. Be careful of folders within folders. Selecting individual files is very cumbersome and doesn't always capture the folders within folders. And, if you need to back-up another computer across a network -- this won't do it. According to Iomega tech support, Iomega doesn't have any product that backs up another computer over a network. Be careful. This is accurate -- but other printed things by Iomega don't pan out."
3,OK for loose parts,"It's OK for loose screws and nuts, but not very useful for measuring attached parts because you can't turn the pieces. It would be much better if they had placed the pieces on bearings so you could turn them. The sizes are engraved in the pieces, but they are hard to read."
2,A staff officer's memoir,"I don't remember where I read it, but something like four rear-eschelon troops were required for every single combat trooper in the field. Thus, for every gripping WWII memoir, there were four guys that shuffled paper, drove trucks, fixed amphtracs, shuffled paper and cooked meals.Mr. Hauenstein has written a staff officer's memoir in every sense of the terms. While occasionally interesting, this book drags in the second half as his assignments became more ordinary. I was also disappointed the author didn't address some of the notable intelligence failures in his area, such as the 352nd division at Omaha Beach or the Bulge. His very short writing on that subjet left much to be desired. Overall, I didn't learn much."
2,Database functionality removed,I upgraded from Visio 2000 Enterprise and was dismayed to discover that the ability to generate a database from a Visio diagram has been removed. It is now only available in the Visio version through an MSDN Subscription - expensive and unreasonable for individual purchasers. Buyer beware....if you want database management functionality get something else.
2,Good product - except for crashes,This version of Visio is a good update and worth the money - when/if it runs.PROS: The ability to graph a data model and reverse engineer an existing model is very handy.The graphics are enhancedIt still has the relative simplicity of the older versionsThe enhanced Gantt chart is very usefulThe workflow graphs are also handyCONS:The only big flaw and the reason I gave it 2 stars is that this package does not run on Windows 7 very well. The program tends to crash with a non-recoverable error every 5 minutes or so. There doesn't appear to be any fixes that MS offers. I'm running 64bit W7 on a Dell Latitude E6410 with 8GB of memory.
2,Nothing but problems since it came out! Don't buy it!,The folks at Microsoft/Turbine jumped the gun on this and put it on the market before it was ready. Do yourself a favor and read the many diffenent on-line reviews first. They have had nothing but problems since it launched and now it has been two days since 80% of the people could even log on. I recommend Dark Age of Camelot instead. It is hard to believe that a company like Microsoft could put their name on such a piece of junk.
2,Not very good.,"I played the game for the past 4 days, a couple of hours a day. I have to say the graphics are very nice. Other than that, I have nothing good to offer. At best the game is boring, but actually my biggest problem with the game is how nobody wants to interact. The towns are dead, the landscape is devoid of people. If this type of game appeals to you then get Morrowind. No point paying for an online game if nobody plays it with you."
1,Eye Candy for the Blind: A More Bitter Pill Was Never Taken,"If stunning graphics bogged down in lackluster play and repetitive fighting is your cup of tea, I invite you to have your fill. Just don't choke on the Doormouse. Though still in beta this game offers up nothing new to MMORPG fans and seems to enjoy all the weakest aspects of what is out there already. Only time will tell, perhaps after 6 months of monthly updates this mutt might start to show some pedigree."
2,Eventhough it is in Beta stage,"People get mad and say its just a Beta..They would have to destroy the current Beta, Keep the Graphics and vamp the current AC-Dm game to make it worth buying. Its a game for ages 7 to 100 making it so ANYONE can play even ppl not used to playing MMORPGS. Im extremely dissapointed with Turbine and do not recomend this Game(Unless they start all over) I do reccomend this game to peeps who are easly entertained and do not have much gaming experiance at all...errrmmm the saying ""dump ppl game"" comes to mind. Athough im only calling that to ppl who buy. I gave it 2 stars for Graphics only."
4,Alot of Wrong info....,"Seems that alot of people that have claimed to have played beta... Haven't really.. Only humans for instance can be archers (heh heh). And no Trolling the Ac2 Vault boards doesn't not mean you have played the game.The idea of the game is AWSOME! Defending cities with your kindgoms, crafting your own bows/swords/armor. No NPC vendors. I loved the way they set up the game. The story... the way you can interact with it... You shape the things that happen. As far as the Skill trees, they are alot more complex than they first appear to be. But you would have to go take a look at them for yourself."
3,not sure,I bought asherons call in 1999 and played it for awhile then put it aside until now. I want to play it again but find then download to regain all the updates I have lost is over 100 hrs so thought a new versdion of the game would solve this hope thats true.
1,Lost Adventurer,"This game seems to be that last piece of mudfish, at the bottom of a three day old gumbo. Developers plan to stir AC2, and hand carry waves of xp hunters across the ruins of dereth. Seems the only ones with some pleasure and excitement are the developers...I want a job doing that!!!No freedom for the flavor to lift from the pot and it draws no attention to the recipe. With a few hundred sheets of explanation, one might begin to explore the fine art of 'crafting' -woowee!!!If you want some low-pot gumbo, with shards of shredded meat-bits and by-products, please grab yourself a teaspoon of AC2. Otherwise, wait until someone cooks a fresh pot.Im going to give the beta/shelf/home/neighbor/friend/relative version of AC2 a big two toes down.Someone please tell the next devs that people want to interact with each other, in spite of the perils about...not the other way around.Anyhow...GOOD LUCK AC2!!"
1,"Great eye candy, but gameplay is so boring.","The game itself is amazingly beautiful, the graphics are superb. But, when it comes to gameplay, Its horrible mindless and boring. For melee, you just sit there whacking at the monster and then hitting a number key everyonce and awhile (Sounds like daoc, eh?), .. wait a minute... mages are the same thing! Just from a distance.. and.. well, so are archers. This game is so horrible game play wise... but, with graphics is so awesome."
1,High Hopes Lead to Bitter Disappointment,"My daughter played Asheron's Call for two years. She grew bored with it in time and eagerly anticipated the release of Asheron's call 2. After playing the AC2 beta for one week she quit in disgust.My wife loved (and still loves) Asheron's Call. She was very excited when she got the chance to play in the Asheron's Call 2 beta. For three or four weeks she struggled along finding less and less to like. But she always hoped it would improve. I'd play in the beta with her once in a while.Then one day we stopped playing, looked at each other and she said ""it's awfully hard to find much fun in this game.""We haven't been back since. Very disappointing game; simple-minded and totally lacking in any long term fun or satisfaction."
2,Need's Improvement,... well the graphics ARE great but only if your PC can load it ...I have created must of the characters and find the Archer works best for me ...but not to happy with the vitae reduction system or the way the xp system works.....but I'm sure over time changes will be made to make most of the players happy.
4,Game is fun but be ready for bugs!,"This game is a lot of fun but is extremely buggy! I have played Everquest for one year and played AC2 for one month now, and have had more program errors/bugs/system server errors with AC2 in one month than my one year on Everquest. Tis a fun game but still needs much work."
5,...,This game is amazing in every way. Ive played every popular MMORPG released within the last 5 years and this one is by far the best!
1,A MMORPG With Training Wheels,"Well, It's only in beta (I'll change the review if necessary when released) but this is a STARTER MMORPG.There is nothing complex in this game.Everything is point and click, and very simply to play use and understand.This makes it VERY boring for those people who have played other MMORPG's before (UO, AC, DaoC, Everquest).But for those new to the MMORPG game genre, then you might enjoy this!! Especially once the live team comes on board."
1,Boring....,"I play Asheron's Call, and I love the game. So when offered the beta test for Asheron's Call 2, I jumped at the chance to try it out. One word describes the game....BORING. I have never been so bored when trying to play any game. The graphics are pretty but....the game play is horrible. I gave up on playing the beta because I saw it as a complete waste of time. I know it is definately not worth the price they have set for it for when it comes out."

5,Truly sensual and accessible to many body types...,"Some dance videos aren't ideal for all body types. Jo Weldon's ""Honey and Spice"" is not one of these. This is a delightful and easy to follow overview of two distinctly different burlesque dances. Jo's instructional style is sassy without being brash or disrespectful. She encourages dancers to love their curves. The warmup is especially beautiful and easy to pick up, even for beginners to burlesque. The performances, demonstrations, step-by-step breakdowns accompany several costuming tips. The music is heavenly and not some of the overused, cheesy ""burlesque"" tunes you'd expect to hear in a cheap club. Jo gives a true touch of class to this beautiful, yet often misjudged dance style. Highly recommended for beginners and advanced dancers of all shapes and sizes! A true winner."
5,A humble introduction to the masters of our time,"This book is one of the most honest, articulate, and personal books about the search for enlightenment that I have ever read. Thompson writes from the heart, and his dedication not only to finding the ultimate truth, but to relating the messages of enlightened masters to the reader, is at once moving and inspiring. The interviews with these masters are invaluable, and are organized in such a way that the seem to blend together even in their contradictions. Thompon's unique style summarizes their teachings with respect, humility, and thoroughness, and his personal experience of these teachings add a richness that makes this book a beautiful testament to the search for inner truth."
5,FasTract is right for you,"FasTrack what can I say that has not been said already, easy to put together. Easy to take apart or hang an oval on a wall or both half of a figure 8 just to get it of the floor. O-36 Manual Switch works well with all FasTrack. The Left and the Right Manuals Switches are the only ones I let my 10 year old use. I less for him to break. The switch is thin and just a small tap would break the orange marker (my son broke it the first day). Super Glue will fix it up again, but something that has to be touch to switch should not break so easy."
2,Outcast,"The whole thing set up very easily in about 20 minutes for 2 computers. It probably helped that both PCs were fairly new Dells running XP. Only problem came when I downloaded the firmware update from Microsoft. After it installed, my system did not see my broadband connection until I unplugged and replugged my broadband modem."
3,Some problems,"I recently purchased a base and adapter to hook up another desk top computer. I also could not complete the installation because of a firewall.I disconnected the Norton protection, but I still could not complete the installation. If this happens you have to enter the required information by hand when you install the adapter for the remote computer. I also lose my connection for no apparent reason, approximately every half hour. I have to pull the power, and wait 10 seconds, then plug it back in again. Microsoft is aware of this problem, because they are the ones who told me to do this. ONe time the base station computer couldn't access the internet, but the remote computer could ??? I had to delete the program on both computers and start over again. There are no waits to get help from Microsoft on the phone. When it works, it works very well. I agree it is not ready for prime time yet. I have only owned it for 5 days."
2,Good straightener... unless you use it for over 3 months,"This straightener works pretty well -- heats up quickly and makes hair as sleek as its design. I like how it looks different from most of the other straighteners out there. The design is nice, colorful, and modern. Aesthetics may not be too high on your priorities for a straightener, but it's a good bonus. One thing I don't like -- since the straightener is so lightweight, it feels a bit cheap and unsubstantial sometimes, but that's not really a big deal. Overall, it's a good straightener and I would definitely recommend it.*EDIT: After three months of use, this straightener just suddenly stopped working. The ""on"" light would be lit but the straightener would remain cold. I'm trying to get my money refunded."
2,Know what you're buying!,"My notes on Microsoft Wireless Base Station setup:-- if running Windows 2000, you are in for tough going. The setup wizard will not work with W2000, so you are on your own doing a manual setup and reading every one of the fine-printed tech-speak words on pages 41 through 72 of the user guide. You will start feeling pretty lonely by about page 50. On page 84 of the users guide it says ""setup and functionality are limited for Windows 2000"".-- the AC adaptor is 120V AC/60Hz, not 50 to 60Hz, so take note Europeans. This is a US-only-electric supply product (AC adaptor output is 12VDC/500mA.-- the MS Base Station lies between your DSL/Broadband modem and your computer, and can connect to your computer only by using an Ethernet connection. So, if your DSL/Broadband modem connects to your computer using USB only, you are out of luck.Go find another base station.Bottom line: Dont even think about buying this product without a thorough review. Save your receipt!"
1,Don't Even Consider This Product,"Weak system. Set up on WIn XP machine and was terrible. Signal was weak no matter what we did. Set up the entire system in one room, shut down all wireless phones, cell phones and anything with an on/off switch. No go. No police stations, fire stations etc nearby. Eliminated all possibilities. Sent back for Netgear b system. Works great. Microsoft should stick to their monopoly areas."
4,A little rickety.,"We like Playmobil toys, but the boat motor in this set is a little rickety. We've already lost one engine cover, making the little boat quite ghetto. The shark is adoraboe, and the surfer dude is very fun. The surfer stands up on the surfboard by wedging his feet between two small blocks on the board.We used the surfer and the shark as decorations on a surf-themed birthday cake."
5,Wonderful roaster pan,"We bought the Calphalon Stainless 16"" Roaster when the non-stick roaster we had only used about 3-4 times started to lose its non-stick coating. (I didn't like the idea of making gravy with little bits of non-stick poisoning in it.) This roaster made a perfect goose (if you've never tried it -- do! It's more moist and rich than turkey, but you get less meat per pound). The pan was almost effortless to clean up afterwards --much easier than the non-stick. I ended up not making the gravy (too darn tired after staying up 'til 3:00 am the night before finishing the sewing on a hand puppet for my daughter who wanted a ""sun with multi-colored rays"" from Santa -- try finding that at the mall!), but the drippings looked perfect and would, i'm sure, have made a classy, non-stick-free, gravy. I would highly recommend this product."
5,A great value,"I have roasted everything from vegetables to every kind of roast and poultry in this pan and it's the greatest. The handles are well placed - they don't take up space in the oven and they're very sturdy and easy to grip with oven mitts. I love that it's heavy enough to go right to the stove burner to deglaze or make gravy. It cleans up very easily - if you don't deglaze to make a sauce, simply put some hot water in the pan, turn up the burner and use a silicon spatula to ""scrape"" up the stuck on food. This pan performs like much more expensive models - I've used them all and this one is a great value."
4,Movie History,Good summary of some really good aaward winning movies and how they reflected American values. Bough this for my wife and she is really enjoying it.
3,Face leaked within three days of installation,Either the face is not sealed or there is an internal leak - the gauge filled with moisture within a few days of being installed. I've ordered a replacement through Amazon.Followup: I received the replacement from Amazon promptly and installed the gauge two weeks ago. Working fine. A second similar (bottom mount) Poolmaster gauge I installed at the same time is also working fine.
5,Philips digital picture frame,It was a Christmas gift for my wife and she loved it! It is every thing it was advertised to be.
4,Great Frame,"I enchanged a Digital Spectrum MF-575 that I was very dissatified with for this frame. Although this was substantially more, I am extremely pleased with it! Colors are bright and clear, there are some great options including an on-off timer and it is extremely easy to load your pictures off your computer via USB port. The only thing I do not like is that it doesn't seem to allow you to play your downloaded pictures as well as pictures from the frames memory. Also, I don't really get why there is such a price discrepancy in the milk colored frame and the wooden or metal frame. It's the same frame, the prices should be the same."
2,From Back Cover,"The Only Thing That Can Bring Down a Quinn is a Woman...The Last Mighty Quinn... P.I. Sean Quinn lives by one rule - never get involved. And he's always held to it...until his latest case, where he nabbed a polygamist just before the guy led another poor woman astray. His mistake? Agreeing to break the bad news to the man's fiancee. Because that woman is already at the church, expecting to become a bride. And she's just asked Sean to be her groom...His Downfall... If Laurel Rand can't prove to her uncle that she's married, he'll leave his entire fortune to a bunch of coin collectors. But before long, convince her uncle is the least of Laurel's problems. Confined with Sean in close quarters, trying in vain to ignore the overwhelming chemistry between them, Laurel sees just what great ""husband"" material Sean is. And she's determined to make him see it, too. Luckily, the deal they made covers the honeymoon stage...7th in The Mighty Quinns series"
4,averageguy@graffiti.com Microsoft Wireless Notebook Adapter,"I have been to severel stores looking for a wireless adapter that runs on Windows 98.I have 2 laptops that are running 98 and at the beginning of the year I purchased the Microsoft one and placed it in the first laptop. Since then I have acquired another laptop and wanted to do the same but could not find the same card in any of the local computer stores. In fact one salesperson told me that wireless does not run on 98 os.Thanks to averageguy, I found what I needed and received it promptly. Thanks JoeJoe Scalisi"
1,Poor Range .. Difficult Setup,"I never got this card to work. After installing the software, it detected a 'poor' connection to my home wireless network whereas my Netgear card shows a 'very good' at the same location. I never got the Internet to work after messing with setup for quite a while. The software routes you through the XP networking wizard and other REALLY UNHELPFUL software. I would advise everyone to go Netgear or something else. The range is bad, setup is way too difficult, and the product is not user friendly."
2,Poor range,"I have two laptops and two desktops, all networked with different wireless cards. This Microsoft card is the worst of the bunch. I can go anywhere in my house with my SMC and Uniden cards, but with the same PC and the Microsoft card and get disconnects or no connection at all. This leads me to believe the problem is in the card itself. I would look for a different card. On the positive side, tech support was quick and helpful."
3,Didn't work at first--frustrationville!,I just received this adapter and installed it almost without any problems. The instructions in the booklet for inserting the card were different from the software--one said to turn off your computer. I tried it without turning it off and it worked (sort of). After completing the installation I still didn't have an interent or networking connection and the signal strenght was poor. (We have a Linksys wireless router--about five feet away).After going through the help screen in the utility menu about four times--it was no help. I finally figured out that it needed the ssid--it didn't detect it automatically (like the usb version does). To make a long story short--I finally manually inputted the ssid and after tinkering a little more it worked.
1,What a terrible book!,"The cover of this book says ""For Exam 70-222"" -- it doesnt even touch what you need for this exam! This book is a waste of time, and it isn't exactly the most well-written text ever!"
5,great,I work in retail and I wear these every day to work...they're really comfortable but also cuter than wearing sneakers all the time. They fit true to size.
2,Sort Table Columns? Home/Student Program Does Not?,"Will this updated version sort table columns? I have home/student program, and it does not sort columns within tables. I have to use spreadsheet to do this. Also, I can't copy long files to transfer to other programs. But what I really want is to be able to sort table columns. Many ""holes"" in Home/Student version that I purchased with my computer and Vista. Good success to all of you. Jeanette"
1,Why? Why? Why?,"It wasn't broken, so why did they ""fix"" it? It is a productivity killer. What was once 1 or 2 clicks away is now 3, 5 or 7 clicks away. The ribbon is a frustrating and unnecessary organizational concept. There are a few upgrades I like (e.g., SmartArt in PowerPoint), but the few true upgrades are not worth the complete reorganization of the toolbars / menu bars that business users have relied on for years."
1,not so good,The item worked for 2 days and was very nice. Then it quit completely. The seller was unresponsive to my emails. I had to file an A-to-Z claim with amazon. They refunded my money. I do NOT recommend this product.
5,FLYING FALCON ROCKS,"La MaMa either used it improperly or never used it at all, judged a book by its cover. The fact of the matter is that the FALCON Infant Car Seat Carrier straightens the back up, not sideways the way the handle would. The handle also rotates the wrist and elbow into an unnatural position which can cause pain. Futhermore, some parents will place the handle inside the arm at the elbow joint and grip both hands together for locking security. This now elimiates the use of both hands.With the ability to stand straight up the user is now able to navigate much easier with hands free to get in and out of doors or car, or carry a diaper bag in one hand and and toddler in the other.I used the FALCON Infant Car Seat Carrier for 9 months with my twins and my wife and I loved it."
1,Seriously?,"So... It will strain the hell out of your back with the weight of an entire car seat. I will keep your baby buckled into their seat more than necessary, making it more likely to flatten their head. Keeping them in the seat also limits their view of the world around them and their ability to interact with you and everything else.I routinely use a sling or carrier. On the rare occasion that I don't particularly want to take my baby out of his seat, I put his seat on top of his stroller.My Baby Nest Baby Carrier in Sand I highly recommend."
1,To much trouble to install,To much trouble to install. Don't like it pulling me down. Felt like I would fall over.
1,"Loses data repeatedly, a faulty product","On two windows pcs and one mac, this lost data. It works fine, then all of a sudden, your files do not show up in the F drive. Hours can be spent looking for them, scouring online sites which say little but 'Fantom does not do data recovery'. They do take your money though.I a highly dissatisfied with this product. I run networks, have 15 years of experience with software and hardware; this is not a newbie problem."
2,Let down,"I kept waiting for the big thing to happen, but it didn't. I re-read the book, including all pictures & misc stubs, receipts etc., I even translated the Arabic into English."
1,what a huge disappointment,"I felt as though I had wasted my evening delving into the most uninteresting and superficial 'journal' called the Tattooed Map. The author had good intentions I'm sure, but the only good thing she did was choosing Morocco as the backdrop. Her imagination was lacking and not deep enough for my taste, and the plot, especially the ending, was a huge let down. All the decorative elements added to the book to give it a travel journal feel was very distracting and I felt as though the author used such elements to disguise the bad writing."
2,VERY LARGE,"The hat itself is adorable, but it is very large. It has the plastic tabs to adjust it, but they aren't tight enough and unsnap too easily."
4,"Unusual, eccentric, hilarious and historic","Berlioz was a man of great ideas - his music abounds with fresh approaches to form, to orchestration, and to melody. And mostly he succeeds. It was a surprise when I first encountered this book to discover what a great writer the man was with words too - and this book is so diverse with its historical accounts, its unscrupulous critiques of the then currently popular music, its humour (don't miss the story about the piano contest), its reporting of the musical world of the time, its insights about great works (Mozart, Gluck - but also Spontini!)..... It's a sort of Decameron of music!I have subsequently read the Memoirs and these are not to be missed either. Berlioz was an extraordinary man and so neglected in his native France.For music lovers generally, I would also draw your attention to Jan Swafford's biography of Johannes Brahms - it is very insightful and wonderfully well written."
5,This book is hilarious fun for classical music nerds!,"Our son first introduced this book to us when he began taking his musical training seriously in high school. He loved the subversive humor! When he moved on to his fine college's music conservatory, and gained more insight into the works and personalities of the classical music world, Berlioz's tales grew all the more hilarious!The disdain his orchestra characters have for the conductors and vocalists of the various operas being performed, and the lack of concentration given to their craft while they instead regale each other with stories, is such a riot! And Berlioz's critique of the political maneuvering amongst ""the claque"" are a real education! Not much has changed over the centuries.This is a must-read for any serious musician. I highly recommend it for students because it adds so many historical elements (Hey! We've got to sneak it in as much as possible!)."
2,Poor performance in rain,"I purchased this tent because of the number of good reviews, esp. regarding holding up in the rain.Unfortunately, this tent leaked on our first trip with it. It is possible that it leaked because the tarp we put underneath didn't completely cover the footprint, but upon inspecting it today as it was drying out, I noticed little holes in the bottom. The material on the bottom seems weak and like the tent won't last long. I did put seam sealer before our trip. I'm really disappointed and should have broke the bank and gotten something sturdier.On the up side, it was easy to put up and is probably fine if you can predict dry weather for yourself.My recommendation---don't buy it."
3,Wenzel Ponderosa 10' by 8' smaller than I thought,"I bought the Wenzel Ponderosa tent for a Native American powwow in NH. I live in CT. My friend and I put the tent up with no problem, there were mosquitos everywhere. Then I saw there was no way my bed would fit. I bought a queen and my friend was using a cot. Between the bed problem and the mosquitos it was too much, we ending up renting a room for 2 days. I did not check the size of the tent. When I saw 10'by 8' four person two room tent, I figured it would be big enough. I did not get to spray the tent & it rained inside. Make sure you know the dimensions, don't be fooled by 4 person 2 rooms. There is not a lot of room to get around."
1,Beware,"I ordered one carton, and the company sent me three. I didn't want 3 cartons! If you try to return them, they will make you pay the shipping for the items you didn't order!! Moreover, the stuff is terrible because it doesn't stay mixed in the milk. It separates into a gross layer on top. What a waste of money!!"
3,Not for beginners,"I have done several Sudoku Books and this one is NOT for beginners, or low intermediates. After the pages 1-7 it gets really hard then you have to cheat!!"
5,Sleepytime Musical Big Bird,This is a favorite with my 15 month old grandson. It is soft and cuddles with him. The music is a big plus.
1,"30 year-old book, with old outdated material w/ new photos","This is a disapointing re-publication of the 25-30 year old Seymour Weiss book that many of us bought ages ago. The information is incredibly old and outdated and worse, misleading. Having reviewed the book, it was not informative either. Some of the photos were cute, but in my opinion many of other the photos showed dogs which were poor representatives of the breed. Overall, a crummy buy, and not recommended."
2,A Breeder's View of Book,"I had a chance to read the book. The photos are new and there are lots of them, but I was also very disappointed in the book's content. The material in the book was really old & out-of-date. The book is a reprint of an old book published decades ago. I am not sure why the publisher went to the trouble of printing this book without checking facts to make sure things are current. I am not sure if this book is worth the trouble."
2,Adequate,"The Rio One is a nice little MP3 player. Very compact. Good sound. Easy to use. It would be ideal as a ""beginner"" unit. The battery flap is easily knocked open, making the battery fall out. The music is still stored but what a pain. Also, since it only has one battery, it is used up VERY quickly and there is not an AC adapter option. Finally, the unit sometimes does not operate at all. I cannot figure out why but the problem, thus far, always goes away. Spend a bit more on a better unit, it'll be worth it."
1,Poor Quality Build,"I bought this for my brother as a Christmas gift. A few days later I decided to try it out and was pretty dissapointed. It was pretty flimsy, as the plastic material felt thin and weak. The headphone input was also messed up. It would only send sound to one ear piece unless you wiggled it around. Needless to say I quickly returned it. I don't know if I got unlucky and bought a defective player, but it was a piece of junk. I was pretty dissapointed as I have other Rio products that are much more durable."
4,A review before publication?,This is regarding the previous review. How can you review a new edition of the book before it becomes available? I have the previous version but I am not going to review this book until I have seen and read it.
4,long cherished desire fulfilled,been an ardent admirer of this cue game ;has tried at places to indulge but unfortunatelynonavailability of proper theory and practical guidancehad deferred this pursuit for a long long time for the sakeof my medical profession ; but this fantastic book in hand i havefound a new zeal after a gap of 30 years; this should summarizemy appreciation of of your product ; my thanks
4,Just good storytelling,"I'm no great historian, so I must only say that I found this book very entertaining. A wonderful escapist bit of light and breezy literature."
3,Low resolution photo,"This puzzle seems to be rather low resolution. The image is beautiful, and it's a fun puzzle, but since so much of it is fuzzy, things get impossible when it comes to the green and blue areas (which account for most of the puzzle). This is good for a real challenge, but we'd like to have seen a higher resolution print with more detail."
4,Attention mainstream protestants,I am glad to see this reprint. I originally was introduced to comparison with a first edition from the church library. It will not be everybody's cup of tea. Anyone interested in the time of Wesley and Swedenborg or the period in general will find it informative.
1,Defective product and no after service,"I bought My Horse Farm for my daughter and was sent a defective product that would not work. Although I contacted Viva Media several times for service, they have simply decided not to respond either by phone or e-mail. I do not suggest anyone should buy their product."
4,"This was fun to watch and kind of weird, too","This is actually a collection of mostly Coronet educational films, Castle home movies, commercials and public domain cartoons, but there's stuff here I have not seen elsewhere.If you like kitsch, don't miss Santa Claus tell his little friends how monkeys celebrate Christmas. There's an ad for Barbie with the voice of Paul Frees, a sort of window-dresser's version of the Littlest Snowman, a wonderfully sille Howdy Doody film with an on-camera performance by Dayton Allen (voice of Deputy Dawg), and it opens with a short version of Christmas Carol hosted by Frederick March and featuring Basil Rathbone.The kids enjoyed it simply because it was so different from so much of today's slick, machine-made fare."
3,Feedback,The Bluetooth adapter works well. It seems to pick up my phone as soon as I get in the truck. The only draw back is that it doesn't pass to the headunit when I get text messages which would be nice.
5,Like a smooth tropical breeze,Given today's financial situation I had to cut back on my luxury brand body care. My cousin recommended this brand and I am so glad she did! This lotion is very similiar to Origins A Perfect World Body Cream and at a fraction at the cost! Highly recommended!
4,Simple. Straight-Forward. Practical. Helpful.,"The ""Bird Flu Preparedness Planner"" delivers what it promises in a clear, compelling, straight-forward way. Dr. Woodsen lays out the facts of this health threat with no hype and no panic. However, it is real, it is deadly, and it is heading our way.The most valuable feature of this slim, easy-to-read manual, is its simplicity and practicality for preparedness. It has checklists of supplies, medicines, and food a family would need in case of a severe epidemic or pandemic. I will try to get Tamiflu (to help with ordinary strains of influenza) and the over-the-counter remedies he recommends.I think the food list could have been a bit more comprehensive. I plan to have more than rice and potatoes on hand to feed a family of six for eight weeks. However my grocery list looks more like a summer cookout for a family reunion than an emergency stash. I suppose 8 cases of baked beans and 8 summer sausages is a little over-the-top."
4,Not what I thought but still great,"I bought this to be a foot pedal for Ventrilo/Teamspeak for playing games to free up a keyboard command. Someone recommended it and so I bought it. Turns out this will not do that. It can't be ""held"" to work with those programs.So now I use it at work for those times my snoopy co worked comes around. It's great and works well. I've also started to use it with to switch between windows (I combine excel sheets a lot)"
1,Not what i thought it was.,I thought this was going to be a foot pedal that I could use for talking in Ventrillo or Mumble while I played World of Warcraft but it's not.It's supposed to hide windows with a foot push.I contacted the seller for return but by the time I paid for shipping and 15% restocking fee they were going to ding me with it wasn't even worth returning. So I installed and tried to use it but it doesn't work very well. Sometimes it does what it's advertized to do and other times. I wasted my money on this.
3,Stick with it as it gets better.,"I was about to give up on the third season of Skins with all of its new characters. While I didn't want to prejudge based on my affinity for the characters in the first two seasons, my main reason for wanting to give up on it was because of the writers and directors complete dependence on flatulence and regurgitation. I got so tired of watching people throw up on screen, and then combined with all of the fart jokes, I figured that the writers had nothing to offer so this was all they could do. But I stayed with it and they did start to explore the hidden complexity of the characters and it got better. Not great yet, but better. So, if you want to try this season out, don't miss the first two or three episodes, but don't be completely put off by the stupidity of them either."
2,Nice artwork...but a bit disappointing,"I bought this book anticipating great ideas and inspirations for murals and was fairly disappointed. Mostly sketches and layouts, it shows little finished murals at all."
1,Dean is never to blame,"I was one of the unfortunate people who got spammed by this guy on Mp3.com. The last song I heard from from him was called ""Suicide Note""...guess I got my hopes too high cuz here he is with a whole album.All of the songs are culled from his experience with a girl named Rachel and the people Dean met during his ""stalking"" of her. The drama that unfolded with these songs, is sadly the most interesting part. The music is pretty dull, and has nothing original to offer. Lyrically he's just trying to figure out why nobody likes him, and wants the listener to sympathize.Dean really wants to be a rock star, but his ambition and utter tactlessness are much larger than his talent."
3,Updated Printing,"This ""pamphlet"", printed in 2004, has been reprinted with a new cover, new title and new ISBN. The contents remain unchanged including the format. The new title is, ""Choosing a Bible--Understanding Bible Translation Differences"". The new ISBN is 1581347308 with a print date of 2005."
4,"Great Visuals and Inspiration, lacks Proper Detail","This is a fantastic book written by a fantastic chef. The physical quality of the book is terrific as is the layout of the pages. Especially striking are the pictures that accompany every recipe (Portale is known for creating some of the most stunning visuals in culinary, and all the recipes are captured splendidly). However, although he explains why he chooses a particular recipe for each of the ""12 seasons"", he does not go into any detail concerning the ingredients used. I was hoping for more of a ""where and why"" for the ingredients that make up each recipe. I will have to complement this book with another that details the peak seasons for ingredients that make up the recipes as well as how to select the best of them."
1,worked for only 5 minutes.,"I purchased this frame after reading lots of frame reviews on multiple web sights to find a nice frame as a gift. I turned on the frame and put in a memory card from my camera to see how it looked. It displayed my pictures very nicely. I then turned off the frame, replaced the memory card with a different memory card and saw absolutely nothing. All I got was a dark screen when the power light was on. I tried resetting the frame, using the original memory card I started with, and no memory card at all. I could not get the startup screen or menu to come up at all."
1,Very disappointing,"The memory chip inside this photo frame is too fragile. I loaded 80 photos without a problem. After properly disconnecting the frame from my PC, later that day I turned on my Philips frame and 14 of the pics were corrupted and did not display. Then, after reconnecting to my PC and adding more photos, another 10 or so photos which were previously displaying fine became corrupted for no reason. I contacted Philips who sent me a replacement unit (which was clearly refurbished) and this new unit had the exact same problem. Don't waste your time or money."
1,ZERO STARS. As BAD AS A 3RD GRADE ORAL BOOK REPORT,"Another poster above nailed it on the head. THIS PACIFIC MEDIA GARBAGE !! Yes, they sell the eye-catching box sets at Best Buy that give you the impression that you are buying a season of some good History Channel series. NOT !!

4,"Well informative, clear and consise.","This documentary was well done, informative, clear, and consise without clouding the facts. There's little repecting information to extend the film."
1,SOYBEAN OIL!,"The main ingredient in the capsules is the terrible SOYBEAN OIL! Which is so very bad for you. The ingredients taste like dog food. DOG FOOD! The color is like dog food, the consistency is grainy. This product is a sham. Snake oil! Real placenta products are the color of plasma, are smooth, gel-like in consistency. This is a waste of your money,- if there is placenta anywhere in the product, all its benefits are definitely canceled out by the cheap and terrible SOYBEAN OIL. I've got one word for this product- ATROCIOUS!"
3,"Compact, with a loud mechanical sound.","Money was no object. All I cared about was immediately getting a compact metronome with a mechanical-sounding knock rather than a cheesy (and harder-to-hear) electronic chirp. This is all that was available near me, and it fits the bill.Negatives: there is no volume control, and its appearance is a bit deceptive because they made it look like there's a mechanical dial where there is none: one must hold a press-spot down to raise or lower the tempo.A wire stand is attached for propping up the unit so that it can be positioned on a flat surface. And as Doug pointed out, it comes on at 100 beats per minute when you turn it on, which is an annoyance unless you always play at that tempo. :-) Runs off of a 9-volt battery. If you are willing to spend $44 get theMatrix MR-600: it is bulkier, but it has a volume control and a real knob for setting the tempo. I subsequently bought the Matrix MR-600 and it's the best I've had."
3,"Okay, but no volume control","I purchased this for my 8-year old daughter to help her with piano. Unfortunately, she can't hear it when she is playing so I am going to have to buy another one. I know some reviewers said it was loud, but for us the opposite is the problem. Otherwise this is fine for our use. Easy to use."
5,Works great!,It is just the right size to use at home and in the car. I was not able to find it locally and was thrilled to find it here. I keep one in each car and at home.
3,"Eh, it was okay.","There really isn't a lot that can be said about this book. I read this for a bookring on bookcrossing. This is a satire of wresting, war, and politics. The mayor of Minnesota Jimmy Valente (a Jesse Ventura rip-off) tells his story of how he went from a scrawny adopted kid to a heart throb war veteran to a wrestling legend to a governor.It was a light, quick read that didn't take a lot of thinking. It was amusing, not laugh out loud funny, but it kept my interest. As a wrestling fan, I found it enjoyable."
3,"EL SALSERO DE BUSHWICK BKYLN, N.Y.","Hector Trichoche's ""En Vivo"" is just a taste of what kind of salsa originates from gotham city . As a native New Yorker , I am proud that a man of this great potential is Latino and also has the critique's to be successful. I have one criticism on the quality of the recording . I feel it should have been recorded with more power and more filtering , besides the fact that it was live, I give the up-most respect to Hector and to Macho Perez."
3,Does not fit a Taurus PT99.,I purchased this holster for a Taurus PT99AF. It took considerable force to insert the gun into the holster and it was extremely difficult to remove. Impossible for a one handed draw. The holster is riveted and has no tension adjustments. The literature with the holster stated to not adjust or modify the holster in anyway and to return it if the gun does not fit. I am returning it.I do want to note that both Nidacast and Fobus were easy to work with on the problem and with the product return.
1,99mg is just not enough...,We're recommended to have 3-4000mg of Potassium a day. A banana has 300+mg. The pill is not even a drop in the bucket. Not worth taking in such a small quantity. Much better to just eat right.
4,some great old b movie thrillers at a great price.,"i own many of these 50 pack sets and like most of them.this set is full of great old b-z grade crime thrillers from the 30's,40's,and 50's. the transfers are good (at least the set i have is)and the movies are fun to watch."
1,Worst quality public domain set yet,"After briefly previewing every video in this set, I immediately sent it back. I have owned numerous public domain movie sets over the years, both good and bad, but this is hands down the worst set, quality wise.The majority of the movies have unacceptably poor video or audio or both. Pretty much the only selections that have decent audio are the sprinkling of television shows that are included (so this really isn't a set of ""50 movies."") The video transfer is excessively bright on most of the videos, to the extent that details are rendered largely indistinguishable.If you are viewing these on a small screen, such as a portable DVD player or maybe a 20 year old 19"" set, the video quality might be acceptable. But on any modern TV the vast majority of videos in this set are unwatchable.That's not a great deal at any price - pass this one up and shop around for a different boxed set."
2,Not so sure.. reef was not happy.,"I'm not quite sure how to pinpoint the problem... but I went through this whole tub and my reef was not really happy. (55 gallon tank) My trumpet, frogspawn, and hammer corals were all receding and I couldn't figure out what was going on. Fish have all been fine though. I do big water changes. The first water change I did with a different salt, things started looking better. Another 50% water change later, and things are bouncing back to life. Just my 2 cents. Not a good experience for me."
4,Great resource! - very good summaries with lots of practice problems,"Excellent reading with good step-by-step solutions and practice exams. Only two complaints: one, wish they would place some practice problems with solutions not right below so you might be able to try the problem on your own before viewing the solution. Also, some questions are just ridiculously easy so only half of the problems can actually benefit a thermodynamics student. Those half are generally pretty good though and worth the 15 or 17 dollars."
5,The best belts,Works great and looks to have nice quality. I have to replace my belts and have backups because I use these on my offroad car.
4,Excellent DVD Player,"Don't know all the technical stuff, but this player has lot's of great features (play videos, music, pictures from USB and multi-card reader), and has a great picture. I was real happy with it."
4,OPPO is a very worthwhile unit.,"Resolution is only a small portion of image quality. I use a big plasma (58"") and view at 12'. In this setting, 720p vs 1080p is meaningless, so no need for Blu-ray or HD DVD , IF... IF standard DVD can be effectively upconverted to 720 p and image quality is good (combination of brightness, contrast, color reproducibility, etc., beyond just resolution), then HD DVD is just more expense, not better viewing. Oppo does an excellent job."
5,Oppo DVD,THe Oppo DV-970 is a great product. My widescreen DVD's are now a lot better on my plasma TV - almost HD-like. The audio is also better than my previous Sony DVD player. The Oppo is worth the $150.
5,excellent!,"This DVD player is an excellent product! It performs exactly as advertised and comes with easy to understand instructions... which you don't really need since it is basically just plug-it-in and play-it. I haven't had the opportunity to play other formats but when I play standard DVD's and watch them on my HDTV, they look great! This ISN'T a an HD DVD player but until the industry works out ONE standard (HD DVD or Blue Ray) I'll be happy with this fine player!"
2,DV-970HD,My expectations were not to high due to the low price. I was pleasantly suprised! Sounds much better than many more expensive units. 5 Stars is how I rated Unable to input above
5,Superb DVD player,"Easy to set-up (for best quality:1 cable [HDMI, supplied], everybody can do it!), easy to use, superb image quality. Yes, it feels a little flimsy when you open it to put a DVD/CD on, but it is not designed for heavy duty. Best possible cost/quality you can get."
4,Very good DVD player,"I'm happy with my DV-970 so far. The only complaint I have is the sound quality when playing a CD is not as good as my CD player (I thought I could get rid of my CD player and save rack space). This should not be a surprise though as the CD player was more expensive. Also, my AV receiver remote does not have a code for oppo since it's not as popular as other brands."
4,How To Get Out Of A Slump,"This book gets right to the point. You can tell that the author knows alot about sales. The idea of repairing my emotional state, was so incredible because it is the one thing I never did before. I have often struggled getting out of a slump and this 3 step process made it so much easier. I loved it and I stronly recommend this book as a must for any salesperson's library."
5,Simply the Best!!,"I have been a huge SF59 fan for a while now and was very excited when this new album was released. The thing about SF59, for me anyway, is that I can usually listen to most of their albums start to finish without skipping songs. This CD is no exception. I hope Jason Martin and the gang keep going for a long time yet..."
2,Transom Bracket ONLY,"The photo of the product and price would indicate that the pump is included with the bracket. I sent an email and asked the seller to confrim that the pump is included. The response was: ""I am not sure - you can just send it back if your not satisfied"". This is only the bracket and the pump screen. Way too much to pay for this without the pump. I would return it but not worth the hassle."
1,Fire Hazard!,"This replacement lasted less than 6 months. Putting any torque on the wire connectors causes damage. The wire from the power supply to the laptop can loose from its plastic cover on both ends within an few weeks. I've been living dangerously within since then thinking that if I kept the cable perfectly straight, things wouldn't get worse. I have to jiggle the connector every few minutes as it tends to short out. This unit has been making a ""fun"" electrical crackling sound for a while now. I can't believe how dangerous this item is and how stupid I've been for continuing to use it. Do not buy this unless you're interested in burning your house down."
2,Doesn't work for me as a cereal...Maybe as an addition to bread recipes,"The taste and texture of this cereal just doesn't excite my taste buds. I would agree with another reviewer's point that I would need to add fruit, nuts and sweetener to make this tolerable as a cereal. However...I tried a recipe on the bag for whole grain muffins that ARE TO DIE FOR, so all is not lost. Another reviewer adds it to her bread, so today's experiment is with my honey wheat bread recipe. Might also be good in my whole grain pancakes. It is excellent as a source of whole grains and fiber, but not a winner in the unadorned cereal category."
1,expiration date was too close after product was received,"i received the product and it had an expiration date for a bit over three weeks later. Even if I was to have this every day, there is no way I could finish four packs in three weeks. Greatly disappointed. The seller cares more about selling the product for profit than customer service. the health benefits of the product make it worthwhile, although I personally gagged the first two times I tried to have this without additions like stevia, honey, and some dried fruit. but that is just my personal taste, i dont like bitter things and this is extremely bitter on its own. when stevia or tablespoon of honey is added with some fruit, this is not bad at all. just need to find it in the stores."
3,long cooking time and a smooth consistency,"I tried it and didn't care much for it, but it might be fine for people who like cereals with a very smooth consistency. I had to mix it in with other cereal (oat bran or rolled oats)."
2,BEAUTIFUL CLOCK THAT DOESN'T WORK.,"I PURCHASED THE CLOCK AS A PRESENT. WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW IS YOU NEED TO TAKE THE CLOCK TO A JEWELER TO GET IT TO WORK. THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT PRINTED CLEARLY, SO DON'T TRY TO DO IT YOURSELF."
3,OK,The songs are catchy my 8 and 9 year olds like the songs but the multiplication parts in the songs are sometimes spaced out with lots of words in between. Very hard to actually memorize times tables...
4,Googols of Fun,"Bird-like creatures from space named googols (named after a very large number) take you on an exciting adventure through the universe in this award winning product, teaching facts about numbers and world geography at the same time.The multiplication vacation ""movie soundtrack"" help make the learning of multiplication facts fun and exciting.The CD begins with a ""star wars"" feel-""Long, long, long ago in a galaxy faraway..."" -grabbing your kids attention from the get-go.My kids enjoy listening to the songs, and once the CD turns off I can often hear them humming a few of the tunes and chanting the phrase ""googol power."" My 4 year old particularly enjoyed ""two two two"" and ""penguin rap"" was a big hit with everyone.If you're looking for some catchy ""educational"" music to play at home or in the car, look no further..It's right here."
5,Great Reggae,"One of his earliest and maybe best, when he wasn't just stamping out largely recycled commercial albums.Not my all time favorite but very revered in Jamaican Reggae Music."
1,dire,"the front cover shows a gorgeous brunette, the heroine is blonde with blue eyes. Says it all really. Boring, predictable, unimaginative, sex by numbers. I couldn't even be bothered to finish it. I've read lots of Black Lace and authors like Emma Holly and Helena Ravenscroft really ignite the reader...but this one? A no no I'm afraid."
1,Smut novel with no plot...,"This novel left me cold. Feminine Wiles is centered on a heroine who, despite having supposedly fallen in love with a passionate French artist, sleeps with everything with a pulse. The aforementioned exploits are expected in erotica, but I often like plot, eroticism and sensuality to back the scenes up. And the story of a woman who comes back home from vacationing in France to claim her late father's inheritance, only to encounter problems with her greedy, sadistic stepmother, isn't well developed, to put mildly. This is smut erotica with very little plot, characterization and sensual scenes to make it interesting. By far, one of the worst Black Lace books I've read. I agree with the other reviewers here. Skip it..."
5,bought for my son,"My son his a real bad in step. The insole helps a lot. He has no more pain when walking. He is on his feet all day at work. Highly recommended,"
4,My feet feel better,"I have had some pretty bad pain in my arches, and other inserts never really held up well. These are great. I've had them about 2 years, and they have still maintained their form, and I don't have any pain anymore as long as I wear them. I wouldn't mind having inserts that feel a bit better on my feet in terms of the material. It's not bad, but it doesn't have ANY cushion. So I'd probably recommend considering the same inserts with the cushion. But, these have worked well in terms of providing better arch support."
3,feet hurt after standing in them a while,"First impression is not great. I ordered these on-line and then before they came I happened to see the Dr. Scholl's Foot Mapping machine in a store. The machine recommended Dr. Scholl's Custom Fit Orthotic Inserts CF 440 because I have low arch and very high pressure. I went ahead and bought those and started wearing them, and I love them. These were not the cheap replacement in-soles, BTW, like I've tried before from the drug store. They were more expensive than the Powersteps.Then the Powerstep Originals came in the mail. After wearing them a while both my feet were hurting, although originally it was only my right foot that was bothering me.Maybe my feet would get used to them after a while. The directions do say to wear them only a few hours a day at first. However, the Dr. Scholl's orthotic inserts provided immediate relief without any need for a break-in period."
4,Better than most insoles I have tried.,"I have tried everything from off the rack insoles to custom made orthotics to address the shin pain, due to overpronation or flat feet, I get from fast walking and running.These are no magic cure for me, but they at least feel like they are doing something. Unlike most off the rack insoles the arches of these don't just flatten out with your foot, they provide real support but not too much ( like WalkFits ).Even though the outer parts wearout with use the internal hard arch piece seems to hold up well. Once the outer layers wear away I plan on just putting the hard part under thin insoles to keep using them. I suspect these would be helpful for those who have minor foot problems."
3,Not as good as Super Feet...,"...but less expensive. For mild foot problems or to prevent problems, these work well enough. May make some shoes too tight, even after removing the inside lining of the shoe."
5,A fresh start for the college freshmen!,"""15 ""Easy and Fun Ways"" College Freshmen Can Improve Their Vocabulary"", makes it both fun and easy for college freshmen to improve their vocabulary. It also does a good job at pointing out the importance of vocabulary and how it can be used to improve their lives in a way they can relate to. The exercises can be performed almost anywhere.Review by:Lois Center-Shabazz, author, Let's Get Financial Savvy! From Debt-Free to Investing With Ease"
4,Great text.,Really great book that encompasses an interesting perspective on a variety of cultures and the history of religion and power which has shaped our current world. Anything that recalls a time when women ruled the world is all right by me!
3,hellow dimond,do you want to see bratz forever dimondz dolls. type bratz kiana in google image seach. click on the picture of kiana and phoebe.wait dont click on the big image just wait when you see a picture of fianna click on it then you have gone to the bratz pad website. click on news then just go down until you see bratz forever dimondz dolls(ps go down more if you want to see sheridan.)
3,It takes a while for your hands to feel warm,I have been running during winter in the high 30's / low 40's. It takes a while for your hands (especially fingers) to feel warm.
2,Sizes don't work for females,"I was excited to get these gloves due to the reviews. I need gloves that actually keep my hands warm without sweating so I don't have to pull them off while running. These were supposed to do that. However, the size of the gloves are just too large for my hands & I don't have super tiny hands; rather, I have average size hands. There weren't any other sizes, so I was extremely disappointed."
1,Bag tore open after three weeks,"The book bag ripped after three weeks use. The previous bag from a different company lasted almost two years. In fact, my son is using the older bag with the small hole in it because the new one that I ordered from this site ripped after three weeks use!I wanted to give it 0 stars but the option was not available. First time something bought through Amazon has disappointed me. Do not buy this bag!!!"
4,IT WILL DO,"I bought this for my husband that works at a correctional facility and they must carry their personal items in something that can be inspected easily so he has always chosen clear backpacks. Works great only problem we found was the very first time my husband was putting his stuff in it the zipper for the front pocket pulled apart and is useless. Otherwise the bag is very sturdy, has lots of room and many other compartments that allow him to secure items"
3,low quality but I guess that is the idea,not that well put together or nice looking but it is a clear backback if that is what you are looking for.
2,Broken Zippers,"The first day I used the main zipper it broke. The zipper is cheaply made with ""pot metal"".The second day I used the other main zipper and that broke, as well. Please change the zippers to something with more quality because the material for the bag is good and solid. I would even be willing to pay a liitle more money for better zippers than your company is currently using ."
3,Good one.,I work in a prison system where clear bags are required. This is a good bag but is not heavy duty. Don't add too much weight or it will rip.
5,Astounding accuracy,"I have done hundreds of numerology readings based on the information that I learned in this one book. I've read dozens of books on the subject, but this is the most comprehensive from a personality point of view. Extremely accurate and so much fun to learn about yourself and your loved ones on a deeper level. A must have for anyone interested in the topic of numerology, or personal growth."
5,Interesting Book,"I really liked the information in this book. I shared it with my friends, reading what the book would say about them also. Book is right on with what a person is like based on there numbers. You will have to get the book to see what that statement means. It really is worth the money. I review it often."
