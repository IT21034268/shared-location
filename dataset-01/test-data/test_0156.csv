1,elastic rumples,"The elastic waistband rumples, the threads fray, and they generally fall apart. I love the Hanes premium ones--and I guess their idea is to get you to waste your money on the cheap ones and then upgrade. Well, it worked...but hopefully this review saves you from the waste-money part."
1,NO ERA LO QUE ESPERABA,"Buy these boxer and really let me down, I buy boxer (Giordi or another brand) with a bag to hold the testicles, however I wanted to try the boxer who offered by Amazon, believing that at least this model had this feature but did not, are almost a vulgar shores, completely flat in front and after a few washings, they tend to stretch. In short, I will not mark the boxer, to buy again, I will put more attention to photos and comments.Compre estos bóxer y verdaderamente me defraudaron; yo compro bóxer (Giordi u otra marca) con bolsa para sostener los testículos, no obstante quise probar los bóxer que ofertan por Amazon, creyendo que al menos este modelo tenían esta característica pero no fue así, son prácticamente unos vulgares shores, totalmente plano al frente y después de algunas lavadas, tienden a estirarse. En definitiva, no volveré a esta marca de bóxer; de comprar nuevamente, pondré más atención a las fotos y comentarios."
5,Permanently Unsettling,"This is possibly the most profound book I've ever read. The origins of our ideals, the death of old beliefs - everything in our culture is explained and in most cases gracefully eviscerated. The sad part is that while Rieff could tear down Freud, Jung, Reich, et al, he couldn't provide (or at least didn't bother to provide) a replacement for the civilization they've wrought.Rieff's style takes a few pages to get used to, but once you assimilate his vocabulary and idiom, you find yourself tripping intellectual land mines on nearly every other sentence. Wish I could say the same for his other books, but this one does well enough by itself. Definitely worth multiple readings."
3,This is an Interview CD - Interesting - But No Music!,"Beware that this is not a music CD. This is an interview with Badfinger bassist and song-writer Tom Evans done by Australian Glen A. Baker.The interview took place in London in January 1983, 10 months before Evans took his own like, in the same tragic way as his band-mate Pete Ham had done 8 years earlier.It's a very good and revealing interview, but obviously meant for big fans of Badfinger.The CD-cover is somewhat misguiding, featuring the whole band. The playing time is about 33 minutes."
2,Foggy motions,"2 1/2Even with its slacked lo-fi grogginess intact, there is an undercurrent of persuasion keeping things alive at least."
4,Buckingham puts America in a new light,"Dr. Buckingham puts the Red scares and other anticommunist activities in America in a new light, showing that American authorities violated their own concepts of freedom and justice by overreacting, harassing, and otherwise repressing leftist political thought in America. As a student of Dr. Buckingham for a year, the prose in which he conducts his lectures is recreated in a work that flows well and does not get heavily into detail, making it a light and breezy read for laymen or anyone else simply interested in the subject."
5,"A fantastic collection, but not all of my favourites","The reviews so far have pretty much touched on how great Face To Face is and was. Ive been listening to this band for more than 10 years, and its sad to see them gone, but this is a great way for new fans to get an introduction to the band. I give this collection 5 stars, because every song is fantastic. I do not, however, consider this to be the best of face to face's library. There are some personal favourites like ""no authority"", ""resignation"", ""1000x"", ""think for yourself"", and so many others. If you are a new fan, this is a great way to check out some of the bands best songs in one package. If you are an older fan who already owns all of the albums, this one is really only worth it for the 2 extra songs."
4,Not a bad album at all,"Like many others I had heard the single several times before buying the CD. It is not a super strong album, but Sheri Frasier, and S&C are two of the better songs this year !"
3,Use to be a lot cheaper!,"When I bought this I was pretty sure it was less expensive . Will now look at other site, it a shame."
4,Good but a bit too scholarly me.,"There were two books titled ""Jane Austen and the Theater"" published in 2002; one by Penny Gay and the other by Paula Byrne. As an avid reader of Jane Austen's novels I was curious and ordered them both to see what they had to offer. Clearly, this book is the result of extensive research but from a casual reader's perspective, I think Penny Gay's work was geared more to the academic reader than for someone with a casual interest. I think this book will prove to be a very good reference source as there are many details showing the theatrical context of each of Jane Austen's novel."
2,Kinda Boring,"""Rock This Town"" and ""Stray Cat Strut"" Are good, but the rest of the CD is kinda boring. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Worst written text ever,"This is likely the worst written text I have ever had to suffer through. I suspect that our prof felt the same way, as she, thankfully, didn't have much required reading from it. There must be a real lack of material on library management for this book to actually be a required text for anything. I am looking forward to warming my house with it this winter. Can I give it fewer than one star? Not worth the effort to figure out."
4,Nice Blues,"I would have liked less rock covers and more blues, The blues that are here are fantastic !!!You can see where Clapton and guys like Tommy Castro got their licks from !"
4,Andromeda - 'Originals' (Angel Air),"Another one of John Du Cann's pre-Atomic Rooster's releases. Maybe not as outstanding as their 'Definitive Collection' 2-CD (see my review), but still pretty potent. 'Originals' is a compilation of ten (10) tracks that Andromeda had recorded for their first lp in the summer of 1968. Apparently, the record label had the band re-record the album because the original mixes were simply 'too heavy'. These cuts are THOSE recordings. Not a whole lot different sounding from the previously released versions of these tunes, like ""Lonely Streets"", ""And Now The Sun Shines"", the rocking ""Return To Sanity"" and ""Too Old"", but a little bit, enough to be noticed. Only track here I didn't recognize right off was ""I Can Stop The Sun"". Good British psych. A should-have."
5,Outstanding,"I was scanning the radio on my way home from work yesterday looking for something decent to listen to. My radio stopped on WITF, which is Harrisburg's public radio network. They almost exclusively play classical music, and to be honest, most of what they play isn't the greatest, but the piece of this CD ""Yellowstone"" was what they were playing yesterday. I was blown away by how incredible the track was, so I decided to download it on Itunes. I was always a huge fan of John Williams, and I would have said that his works were by far my favorite to listen to, but this is bar far my new favorite. Absolutely superb.I had no idea that the music was inspired by Yellowstone National Park, but the whole time during my commute home I kept imagining scenery much like the west and the areas like Yellowstone. Buy this set, you won't be disappointed."
3,Richard Wright - 'Broken China' (Capitol),"Review no. 44. The long-time [late] Pink Floyd keyboardist's second of two solo efforts. Overall, it's a decent British progressive title. Until a maybe a year ago, I wasn't even aware that Richard Wright had two solo lp's out. Time stamp on 'Broken China' in 1996. Tunes here that might lure loyal fans that didn't even know about his work such as this CD are ""Night Of A Thousand Furry Toys"", the quite entertaining ""Hidden Fear"", the well produced ""Woman Of Custom"" and the almost Floyd-like ""Far From The Harbour Wall"". The music here isn't bad - it's merely a little too laid back for me."
3,Half Good,"I had this CD for awhile. liked it initially as I was wanting to hear more 'floyd'. It is a decent companion to the 'division bell' but overall it is a downer (theme wise) Since it is dealing with his wife's battle with depression, that is the theme. I lost interest with the album after awhile tho. It is nice to have something from him again tho, someones title of ""regaining his confidence' is true. Rumor had it he was making another, but years have passed and nothing came out. The album has some moments tho music wise, just wish it was more 'happier'."
2,"Patchy, but very nice patches","with the album having much in common with the Division Bell (age, musicians, sleeve art etc) i was expecting it to be like the Division Bell, which it isn't, with the obvious exception of Coming Back To Life. When it works it is fabulous, but this only comes in spurts: the guitar solo on Along the Shoreline, Sinead O'Conner on Breakthrough. There are few songs which are classics, yet musicianship and production values often lift them above the ordinary. It is th production that so often marrs the album, though. Night of a Thousand Furry Toys is a horrid with dated dance beats and embarassing lyrics (Wright can't seem to bring himself to sing the chorus). It is a song that seems like a joke , yet the album is entirely without humour, and the album never really recovers from this track. It's only in the less gloomy momens that the album picks up, and these are few and far between. A real mess, whilst still hinting at greatness."
2,Only a couple of OK tracks. The rest are forgettable,"This album never reaches any real heights. A couple of mediocre tracks sandwiched by boring tedium. Intricate and rich tapestry with no meaning or central theme. A film soundtrack perhaps, an album it is not. Regretfully, forgettable."
4,The dark side of the remaining Floyd,"I've always thinked Richard Wright was the dark side of Pink Floyd. Here is the proof. Through this album you can feel the scence of the early 70's Pink Floyd underground music, as in Division Bell. The music is better than recent works from floyd's members (Waters and Gilmour), except by Amused To Death, a really extraordinary Waters' work."
5,Diabolical,"This novel is like a cyanide martini garnished with a blood-soaked olive. Ms. Kirino writes such an intense, involving, scary tale (not for the squeamish!) that I don't know if I would have the nerve to meet her in person. The female characters are at once mundane, complex and fearless as they are caught up in a nightmarish world of crime, deception and murder. This one is hard to forget, and I want to read more by Natsuo Kirino; she's the real deal."
5,"""OUT IS IN""","Once again I was looking for a novel by a Japanese writer and spied this on the shelf. I had never heard of Natsuo Kirino and how I wish she was more prolific. Not great cover design but covers can be deceiving. This piece of work is nearly flawless and packed with important ideas and critiques: sociology of middle class Japan and Japanese women, femninism, hard boiled crime fiction, mystery; even immigration. The story moves quickly, is very engaging and at the same time it is powerfully grotesque. One cannot believe that these seemingly bitter, unfriendly women come together in conspiracy and perversity. Sometimes I felt disgusted. Think ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" written from the perspective of a Japanese feminist. This is far shorter and ultimately a bit cleaner and quicker than her previous novel, GROTESQUE (which is also worth the read)."
3,Thoughts,easy read it will go by quickly. Some parts required a reread but a still a good book which I recommend
3,The alchemist,"Thoroughly enjoyed novelette. Spiritual dimension was intriguing. Some elements of the fantasy did not strike a cord with me,however. An interesting read."
4,Do not miss the point,"One may believe that the world does not exist as a single organism, that everything is coincidental and unrelated. I don't!Man continues to search for common laws to explain all matter. Complexity is one of these studies, whereby all matter, living and non-living, organise into more complex structures to perform complicated tasks. From the complexity of the human eye, the stock exchange and our world to the single cell amoeba organism, all may combine to accomplish common outcomes.What am I going on about? Perhaps these common laws to achieve organisation from chaos will work faster for you with positive energy. Perhaps the unresolved solutions that you desire will be achieved as we organise to reach our personal and group goals.The book emphasises that the search towards your dreams and goals is a most fulfilling journey. If you just receive a simple message to believe in yourself and follow your dreams, the author has succeeded."
1,Much ado about nothing,"There is nothing deep or profound about this very simple story. It is a fairy tale, a child's bedtime reading. It reminded me of a drugstore self-help book or The Celestine Prophecy, which is the same kind of pop psychology. What on earth is all the fuss about?"
4,First of all...,"...if you're going to write a review, please learn the difference between ""hole"" and ""whole.""That said, of course The Alchemist is simplistic. Of course it's repetitive. And, of course, it's WONDERFUL. Beautifully written, not-so-subtly teaching, and delightfully uplifting, The Alchemist mixes the mystery of Alchemy with the solidity of Bible stories to make a tale that is as hard-hitting as it is gentle. This story will change your spiritual outlook and make your own personal legend a thing worth searching for."
1,Simply a crap and cheating,Just by using the powerful words like 'Destiny' the author has tried to build up an illusion that it is a philosophical book. In no way it is superior than Fairy tales or ordinary bed time stories. The sad thing is a lot of people have been carried away by the pseudo philosophy of the book. It is highly superstitious and useless for adults. May be used for entertaining small kids.
1,A truly forgettable book,"I read this a couple of years ago. I was struck by just how awful it was. Usually I can find some redeeming qualities in any book, but not this one. Seeing this on the ""best seller"" list made me have to comment. To tell the truth, I can't at this point even remember anything about this book except its awfulness."
1,What a bore,"I bought this to read during my Christmas Vacation. Here it is Christmas Day and I'm waiting to go to the family's for dinner. I'm wishing now I'd bought a thriller or something at least well written. Fortunately I just opened my gifts and my sister sent me a book on dogs. I'm saved. Maybe if I was 17 and just starting out in life ""The Alchemist"" might strike a chord. If a person is happy with their life and direction they shouldn't spend the money on this book. It is boring, boring, boring."
3,Magical Thinking Can Be Fun,"I read this while riding an airplane. It seemed like a child's book to me. It did help to pass the time but the constant reminders to ""follow your dreams"" and ""the universe will help you"" did get a bit monotonous. The story could be much better if it had been plumped up a bit. However it wasn't, so I was glad it was a short book. I would not consider it life changing, but it was mildly entertaining. I'm struggling to think of anything to say about it. I suspect my review will be about as interesting as I thought the book was. It's a harmless book that tries to stress believing in one's self and tries to inspire the courage for the reader to follow their dreams. Yet somehow it left me with a vaguely creepy 'have I been violated or something' feeling. I blame that on the authors insistence that if you follow your dream the universe will conspire to help you. I find that concept rather insulting now that I think about it. Still it was a mildly fun book I guess."
5,Aida Osmani,"This book is one of my top three favorites. I love it. I recommend it to everyone who is looking for spiritual growth, self-discovery, and simply a good read.From The Ruins: Refugee, Daughter, American Soldier"
2,A pleasant read...,"This is a nice story of a young boy in search of his dream, unfortunately the author attempts to throw in alot of fluff, or attempts at serious omens and symbols, trying to create a sense of a deeper meaning than can really be had. Nonetheless still a fair story for inspiration."
1,"Too many answers, too few questions","I almost wish I could give a zero here, but I recognize that the ideas of the author have probably impacted people in ways that were positive for them and for the people around them, while not harming anyone. Compared to many other ideas with a wide dissemination, this is actually pretty good. Now, this said, I could not even bring myself to finish the book. The writing has a complete lack of subtleness, and consists of just one grandiloquent fallacy after another, with an unnecessary use of absolute language. There is a serious lack of questioning or criticism, and a similar excess of earnestness."
3,"Eloquent in its Simplicity, but Flawed Messages","At the heart of The Alchemist is its message to pursue your dreams and not settle along the way. Its overarching purpose resonated with me as did many of the points made throughout the journey, such as the importance of paying attention to the lessons that are learned along the path of trying to achieve your dreams, especially the ones that are particularly grueling and result in setbacks. It is often the setbacks that make us stronger and give us the strength we need to keep moving forward.However, there were also times I felt that the messages were a bit flawed. While I endorse the importance of perseverance and reaching for the stars, there seemed to be a parallel message that you should continue to pursue your dreams at any cost, such as leaving those who you love and care about or risking death. Really? This just didn't work for me."
5,The Alchemist,"Shortly, my personal opinion is that The Alchemist has motivate me to realize my Personal Legend. Because, it has reminded me that there's a lot of obstacles that I have to face in life in order to realize my dream. For this reason, I should never give up until I make my dream come truth. Yet another, important thing that I've learn from this story is that I should enjoy the marvels of the world but not forget what I have. Finally, I've decided to leave my family behind and pursue my dream until I reach my goals."
1,Kindle Edition tooooooo expensive!!!,"When I bought my Kindle, one of the selling points was that I would be saving money on the many books I buy. However, I am finding over and over again that this is not the case! In fact, many times, as in the case of this book, the cost is higher for the digital version than the actual tangible book. Crazy! Indeed it would be more cost effective to buy the books, get the free shipping because I'm an Amazon Prime member, and then be able to give this book to someone else once I am done with it. With my Kindle version I cannot even pass it on. Hmmm."
1,Boring and simple-minded,"After having read some of this book's rave reviews, I finally bought it in the hope of a literary feast for an eight hour flight from New York to Frankfurt - what a mistake. One of the most boring, bland and simple minded books ever. The in-flight magazine was more interesting..."
5,A Feast For The Mind,"If you like food for thought, this book is a feast. The story pulls you quickly through the 160 pages, but all the while you want to slow down and think about the concepts. This book delivers a strong spiritual message without being preachy or biased towards any particular religion. Inspirational. Motivational. Definately worth reading at least twice!"
3,Perhaps I've read too many lately with the same theme,"Perhaps I have read too many similar books in the last couple of years i.e. fables or stories about the search for meaning in life. This is well written and I did enjoy however the message and ""truths"" are similar. There are only so many of these that one reads before they all blend together and become a bit tiresome."
5,It will change your life,This book will teach you to look at life in a different way. It will really change your life with a thought-provoking parable.
2,Can't relate...,"This book was hard to follow for me. Perhaps because his quest was typically male (boyish) and as a woman I found it hard to imagine that young men are that two-dimensional. To think that fullfillment of a dream must be a journey taken alone... Santiago makes nothing happen on his journey. In his quest,things only happen to him, not because of him. Santiago gains insight-big deal. One reviewer from Santa Clara wrote ""I am a self professed evangelist of the book since I've read it. Absolutely love it's lessons without the ""preachy"" feel, and love the fact that the situations are those which every one of us can relate to - though all may not recognize them as they happen to us."" I read the book because of that review...I wish I could get together with this person and discuss that. Lessons learned in the Alchemist are learned on stand-bye, they are not learned from experience. That's no way to grow in life."
1,I'm glad I borrowed this book!,"A friend loaned this book to me and I read it in two days, hoping to see what she saw in it. I is drivel. The characters are easy enough to like but if you're looking for a story that will change your life or help you follow your dreams..... I don't think this will do it."
5,Simple yet complex and excellent,"This book was assigned reading in an english class i took, and at first i thought it would suck. After all, who wants to read a story about some kid from Andalusia who follows his dream to egypt? Once I picked it up and started reading, however, I found that I genuinely enjoyed it. It is one of the better pieces I have read concerning the interrelation of God, luck, omens, coincidence, destiny, and one's part ina ll this. However, readers who do not want to view this book as more than a simple story will miss out on the bigger messages; whether the messages mean anything or not is a personal choice. I recomend this book to any prospective buyers."
2,Overrated.,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. Perhaps it was because I'd already heard so many of my friends raving about it, or maybe it's because I read the reviews and many were good.The point is, the first thing I expected from the Alchemist was a good plot. Which, in my opinion, it was painfully lacking. Only two of the characters piqued my interest, and it wasn't even Santiago, the lead character. He came off to me as two-dimensional and, really, quite boring. None of the events made me sit up in my chair and make me want to read faster: it flowed, yes, but, very, very monotonously and on occasion tediously.There were many intelligent metaphors and inspirational messages about life, but I did not hear anything new.The Alchemist is not a bad book. All I'm saying is it's not anywhere near as fantastic as many people are making it out to be."
2,High on the cheese factor,"I found this short book disappointing. Although it was at times suspenseful, and there were some insightful moments, it was quite heavy-handed and condescending. The writing (a translation of course) is repetitive and feels like it was destined for someone who doesn't speak English very well. There are few characters, and they are not very well developed. If you like modern stories that don't preach or mention destiny, love, and courage every other paragraph, this book isn't for you."
1,Everything that happens is for the best (LOL),It should be illegal to sell this book without including a copy of Voltaire's Candide.Candide: Or Optimism (Penguin Classics)
2,Ehh... Not My Type Of Book,"I first read The Alchemist as a teenager and disliked it and now having read it again (with inhibitions) in my twenties still dislike it. A minimalistic story (without the pleasure of reading other minimalist authors) outlining a boy's quest from Spain to the Pyramids and back again. Mixed in with alchemy, universal languages, souls, omens, and above all else fate - the overriding theme is to follow your dreams, etc. Nearly every noun is a symbol of something else and the overall idea of the book put me in mind of Tuesdays With Morrie or The Secret; that is, a single idea story loosely veiled behind the suggestion of a story. If you're looking for something less metaphysical/religious to read or simply another book with (some) similar qualities I suggest The Higher Power of Lucky."
2,Can't believe people like this book,"Come on people. The writing quality is barely high-school level, assuming that it was translated fairly. How many times can one endure reading the same message over and over? ""Follow your Personal Legend."" Geez. If this is a revelation, you need to get out and challenge yourself more."
5,"very inspirational book, with lots of messages","i loved this book. i read it in one sitting. it comes with so many messages that we can apply to our own lives, and is just very, VERY well written. it is inspirational, and really made me think about its messages when i finished with it. it is a fable, so it comes with a moral. it is an easy read, and i recommend this book to ANYONE who is in search of a wonderful, inspirational read. i cannot express enough how much i loved this book."
2,Little room for imagination,"A shepherd boy named Santiago travels from his homeland Andalusia to the Pyramids of Giza to achieve his dreams (or, as the author puts it, his ""Personal Legend""). Along the way he faces difficulties, overcomes them, and acquires the ability to speak the ""Language of the World"" (the ability to communicate with sentient beings of the world). As a modern day fable, the book possesses neither the compendious quality of R. Bach's ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull"" nor the warmth and imagination of Saint-Exupery's ""The Little Prince."" The indicative mood employed by the author leaves readers with almost no space for imagination. It comes to me as a surprise that this book has been such a hit. Perhaps we are all ears when it comes to fables."
5,Life changing,This book opened my eyes to different views of the world. Views I was blind to before. It's opened my heart and soul.
3,Enjoyable pick-me-up of a book,"This is the equivalent of a caffienated soft drink. Goes down easy. Uplifting. Enjoyable. Not much in the way of long-term effect. But not a waste of time and money.A good read if you are stuck, depressed, demotivated. Might get you out of the rut and back on track.As far as the premise that the universe conspires to give you what your heart desires... People make their own luck. If you are passionate about something, you will work harder and perform better at those tasks than if you dread your work. It's not the soul of the universe at work. It's your own heart and soul bringing out the best in you. How can this not increase your chances for success?"
4,Inspiring,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this magical story of Santiago who was seeking an adventure and dared to follow his dreams. He learned many lessons and acquired wisdom along his path of exploration. This book is written simplistically, but captivates you and draws you into the storyline in a powerful manner. The story setting in the majestic mountains of Andulusia are described as a beautiful place in which Santiago pursued his dreams and found hidden treasures. It is a book that is powerful and provactively written, a good read."
2,I done't like it,strange story - it may be a good writer but not a realistic account of the main person - some might like this type of book
2,Candy coated Pop Philosophy,"While to the uninitiated this book might seem inspiring, it is in fact largely a rip off of various world religious/spritual view points packaged up in a moderately inspired story. The writing is fairly weak by literary standards. The book reads more like a self-help manual with little to no evocative description or creative imagery inspiring you to truly care or identify with the characters. The lessons are rather simple. Follow your dreams, don't let other people tell you you'll fail, listen to your heart, blah blah blah. Hallmark cards and Dr. Phil spin the same cleanly packaged inspirational messages.Like most hippy influenced new-age religion, in the end you get to have your cake and eat it too. Santiago gets the gold, the girl, and Paulo Coelho gets your money. Rather ironic don't you think?Read Siddhartha instead."
3,enjoyable,"This book is interesting, well written, not a literary masterpiece, but enjoyable.The fact that it has been a huge success worldwide is because it is so easy to readand appeals to a well known fact: sometimes we look far and wide for answers thatare just within us. And yes, it is a quest for most human beings to find the right path.Not an easy task.For that it has merit."
2,Simple or Simplistic?,"I understand that this book is meant to be read as a fable, but if that is the case, why does the author insist on spelling everything out for the reader on virtually every single page? Every step of Santiago's journey is so painfully obvious, this feels more like a self-help book with a ""plot"" thrown on top than a fully thought out novel. Yes, it does contain some basic truths, but that does not make for good reading. Furthermore, unless one is completely un-self-aware, one probably has an idea of what some of these truths are in the first place. But I suppose that's why it's so popular - people caught up in the rat race pick this book up and are convinced they've ""seen the light."""
2,Not worth the effort,"The book started out with an interesting story. However, it became mundane and tried to philosophise by using a parable-type of story with confusing sentiments, working in circles around what the writer was trying to espouse. I grew tired of it before the end, but was reading it for my book club."
2,Trite Truisms,"Oddly enough, this book doesn't say anything deep or meaningful that we haven't already heard before. While the message may be a good one, it's obvious, everyone knows it, and ultimately I was asking myself... what's the point? Also, it's like one long lecture rather than a story. So if you're looking for plot or adventure - steer clear.The good news is that it's short, so it won't waste too much of your time. I'm aware that many people were touched by this work. All I can say is ""good for them."" I wish I knew what I was missing."
5,Awesome book,This book should be read by everyone! Its such an awesome tale! It will def be required reading in my household! lol
4,Will you understand the lesson given by this book?,"This a very interesting story where the main character is a shepherd. He wants to find a treasure and he thinks that he will find it within the Pyramids. He will have an initiatic travel and will meet very interesting characters (small masters as I would call them) and adventures. It is a kind of alchemical internal change that will happen to the hero. But the main lesson is at the end. I am not sure that everybody caught it but for those who are following a spiritual path, there is a very important clue or lesson. So do not miss it!"
5,Books That Changed My Life!,"Mesmerizing! This book is simple, poignant, telling, absorbing. Very easy reading, and because of that you just cannot put it down. So brilliantly written (and translated, i suppose), and so wise. rich with stories and characters, places, thoughts, it captivates you, and ultimately inspires you! question is: can you take flight with its inspirations? all it takes is the initial commitment to follow your dreams, and live a truer life. i did! at least for the first few weeks. LOL. STILL, i never forgot its lessons, the ones it bestowed upon me so gently and powerfully! one day i shall take yet another step closer to my dreams. This book could change your life, too."
5,Amazing,EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE.I READ IT IN 2 DAYS. I'M ABOUT TO READ IT AGAIN AND RECOMMEND IT TO ALL MY FRIENDS.
3,Personal believes does not make universal truths!,"The main theme--'Everyone has a Personal Legend, when one wants it badly enough, the universe will conspire to help one achieve it.' It's insprational reading. But according to the book, that was not just an idea, but a law. That--is very hard for most readers to agree to."
4,Nice Read,"I just completed reading the book ""The Alchemist"" by Paulo Coelho. It is a very well written novel about the journey of a shepherd boy towards a treasure. The author has given lot of emphasis about the obstacles he faces and the help he gets along the journey. It ends with how the boy attains his treasure with the help of the omens and some persons he meets along the way.Anyone can relate the incidents in the novel to that of their travel towards destination in personal life. The book is written in a very simple language and provides lot of insight into the life lessons to be learnt. I thoroughly enjoyed every page of this amazing book. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in meaningful fictions."
2,Spelled Out,I found the book too preachy. The author is pushy in his views and spells them out to the reader. There is little room for personal interpretation. In that regard the book reminded me of socialist realism. On the other hand it is quite famous and a short read.
2,a boring parable,"A large number of people recommended this book to me, so I checked out the plot - the quest of a Spanish shepherd to discover a treasure located near the Egyptian Pyramids - and it definitely seemed like something I might be interested in. I looked at the various reviews here on Amazon, and they were overwhelmingly positive, so I went ahead and purchased this book. Sadly, I have to admit that I feel like I wasted my money. The plot is fine, although it seems more like a plot outline than an actual story. If the plot and the characters had actually been developed, it could have made an amazing novel. As it was, the book was less of a novel and more of a pseudo-religious parable. The message of the parable, follow your dreams, is a great message, but I felt as though I were being preached to for 167 pages. I simply cannot recommend this book."
1,keep searching,"I read this book in a day. It's a fast read and interesting little fable. . . .but, the book is too preachy. . .of course you are going to encounter some struggles on your way to realize your dream. It doesn't take a genius to figure this out. The symbolism in the story is too forced. Here's the point. . . .follow your dreams, because only when you realize them will you find peace. . . .if you want to read 160 pages that work you up to tell you just this, than pick up this book, otherwise, just use your common sense."
5,one of the most inspiring books ive read,"I've read this book more than once. It describes persistence/relentlessness, destiny and omens in a very simple and easy way. Buy it, read it, love it....and then buy it again for someone else :)"
5,A Transformational Journey,"An inspirational book about a boy's journey of transformation. Deceptively simple and easy to read, this book illustrates beautifully the concepts of spiritual growth, finding the true self, and following our own destiny."
4,Simple yet profound,"The Alchemist is the gripping story of one shepherd's journey, and yet this story is one that all people, through all walks of life, can all relate to."
3,Disappointed,For all the hype it didn't meet my expectation. Quite a nice story and great messages but the writing just didn't flow that well. Maybe it's more that way reading it on kindle but was definitely let down. Maybe that's because it was translated and wasn't originally written and English
4,Share with your Teenager,"An alchemist is one who can take an element and turn it into gold. The beauty of this book is as much in sharing it as it is in reading it. Finding and following dreams is a lifelong task as you will realize after reading it, but dream quests are paramount for the teenager. I urge you to give your copy of this book to a teenager in your life. Give a gift, no greater than the written word to someone who will prosper from it more than you."
4,A Life Changing Experience,"This book was a phenomenonally superb tale of a dream realized. After reading this book I became aware of all the dreams I had let fade away. The author keeps you reading -- I couldn't put it down. If you pick up this book, I promise that at somepoint before you read the last sentnece you will see your own dreams and have a desire to pursue them. This book is great for anyone who needs a motivational shove or is the type of person that believes in his or her dreams. I highly recommend it!"
4,"A book, for a long train journey & to quote again and again","The Alchemist is a simple easy to follow story about a young Shepherd who sets out on a journey to find his destiny. It really is a book that every young or idle minded person should.It's one of those feel good novels, that really does make you smile. And at the end of the day, thats what I want from a good story. The author proposes lots of philosiphical questions, such as ""the Great Lie of Life"", and ""The Universal Language of Love"", but never seems to dictate a certain ideology to the reader.It's a breath of fresh air, though a little slow and sometimes meaningless in places it does manage to evoke a certain connection between the reader the the character of Santiago, which for everyone is different.But, i feel it should be read, fable or no fable, its just a really easy, enjoyable read."
3,Full of Feel-Good Clichés,"I recently read this book while laying on the beach under the Caribbean sun. And while it's an entertaining afternoon read with a catchy start, I really felt that it went towards the deep end when the main character starts to have a lengthy conversation with the sun and the wind. Felt more like a hallucination. The author manages to pull it back together with a much anticipated happy-ending.Overall, is full of heart-warming clichés such as ""everything happens for a reason"", ""everybody has a noble purpose in life"", ""follow your dreams"" etc, etc. So, if you are trying to feel better about yourself, it might help. Heck, it might even serve as a self-help book.However, a philosophical break-through, this book is not."
4,As Dorothy Learned in OZ--There's NO PLACE LIKE HOME!,"This is such a simple book...I liked it, my book club LOVED it!It is much like Dorothy in the WiZard of OZ! The answer lies within & along the journey.I don't think it's quite as ""profound"" as some people seem to think, however, it is a book which brings up the obvious. If you are living in the moment and have been on your own spiritual journey, it may not have the deep impact it has had on some.It's a great book club book-- this book was discussed more than any other recently! If you want a quick and easy read-- this is it!!"
1,If you need meaning in life you won't find it in a book!!,"This book reminds me of ""The Celestine Prophecy"" because it is very poorly written and extremely cheesy. However, it will be a big hit I'm sure with emotionally unstable spiritualists who took a wrong turn at the crossroads of religion.Paulo Coelho must have smoked more hookas than his characters. This book spans the spectrum of ""GAG ME WITH A SPOON writing"" as the main character ""listens to his heart"", ""talks to the desert"", ""becomes the wind"", ""understands the soul of the world"".....and achieves countless other feats that even Jesus Christ would envy.If you like Ouija boards, believe in fate, or think that spiritual healers can slap you on the head and make cancer go away, then you might like this book. You might also need a therapist."
1,"Quasi-religious, psuedo-inspirational seriously inane drivel","Contrived. Pretentious. Juvenile. That's just the introduction, in which the author discusses his amazement at the popularity this book has gained. It is equally astonishing for any reader who is able to endure more than five pages of: ""The Soul of the World spoke to the Heart of the Boy as he prayed to the God of the Dessert who commanded the Spirit of the Wind..."" I found myself praying to the God of Literature that the boy's beloved sheep would stampeded and trample him to death, sparing me from the Demons of Boredom. If you liked the Celestine Prophecy you'll love The Alchemist. You can read it while you're waiting for the mothership to return. Otherwise, take a pass and read something more intellectually engaging, like the tax code."
3,repitition,"Did not keep my interest. I found it needed more substance, it was to much repitition and moved very slow."
5,Probably the best Story ever Written.........,I love Paolo Coelho's narrative style........his writing is not just simple but it also has some humor........this book is such a nice book.....and GOD BLESS for such a SUPERB Ending!!!!!!!probably one of the best ENDINGS a BOOK can EVER HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Wonderful read!,Easy and fun to read with a lot of quotable material about life's journey and lessons. Have already recommended to others.
3,Simple,"This book has been compared to ""The Little Prince"" and ""Candide"", but I do not find either comparisons particularly fitting. The Alchemist lacked the heart and humor found in the aforementioned parables, and its simple narrative left something to be desired. As short as it was, I felt Coelho took more time than was necessary to arrive at his moral. I was mostly just counting the pages to the end. It was a nice story, if somewhat lacking as a work of literature, and I would be interested to read it in the original Portuguese."
4,alchemist,I enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more by this particular author. Very easy to read & fun
2,The Alchemist Fails to Make The Gold,Sweet parables - wise sayings in the desert - easy read - not very filling.
4,the alchemist,This book taught me that it takes a lot of places to go and a lot of experience to get you to reach your goal. This book taught me to strive for my goals even if you think it's far from reach it can possible if you try your best.
1,"Infantile, stupid, presumptuous and a total waste of time. Absolute BS.","I can't believe this BS had such an amazing success. It seems the world is in a serious hunger for c...p.Infantile ideas...but that would actually cause injustice to kids' stories. Presumptuous. Pompous.But... in an extremely simple language written for 3-4 years old. Allegedly metaphorically spoken. Supposedly explaining to us (the idiots who have purchased the book) the greater powers of the universe...God, the sun, the wind, the desert and a boy that masters them all... duh...NOT reading it - would actually guarantee you'll have a better understanding of the universe, life, love and ... everything in between.A TOTAL waste of time. Pure BS coated with sugary metaphysics. I would use hasher words but Amazon would not publish them."
3,"Wanted to really like it, but just couldn't","I like the ideas about beginner's luck and seeing omens, but really, some of the dialog doesn't even make sense. Maybe a little got lost in translation."
3,Written for little children,"I'm not sure if its the writing style or the translation, but this book makes you feel like you're in Nursery School. But then again, I felt the same way about Siddartha by Herman Hesse. Very basic concepts that illiterate people find profound."
1,Actually worse than Jonathan Livingston Seagull,"This book uses child-like prose to write an overly simplistic allegory that manages to drown itself in a teaspoon of water. Lousy from beginning to end it adds no insight, offers no imaginative writing, and is completely worthless.Many people recommended this book to me, and for that I am saddened about humanity. This book is definitely not for people who enjoy even a modicum of intellectual stimulation. If you are one of those that likes this sort of book, please do not recommend it to others. I am now scornful of many of my acquaintances because of it."
2,It was very good... just not for me.,"The Alchemist had it's interesting moments and a decent morality throughout, but altogether the writing was far too simplistic, repetitive, and predictable for my tastes. I could see how this would be a good gift for a young teen, or a good recommendation to a friend who doesn't read very often, or maybe it's a good book for parents to read to their children, and I must say that my favorite part of the book was the ending, which I see some reviewers found disappointing.I don't think you can go wrong with reading this book- it won't take you very long at all, just be prepared because it gets so simplistic at points that you feel the story has stopped moving even though a lot of progress is surely being made. The characters are decent, but nothing memorable. If you're on the fence I'd say just go to the bookstore and start reading it and see how you like it."
2,Life is what you make of it.....and so on and so on and so on..,"If you are young and need touchy-feely books, this would be a book for you.Although a few may be inspired by this book, I really didn't think it was worthwhile. Life is what you make it, many people write about it, and after you have read about this concept a few times, it is rather boring. ""The Alchemist"" doesn't keep your interest and doesn't say anything new."
4,think about it,"At a glance this is a very simple story you might read to your child before bedtime. But if you are one of those people who wonder about the meaning of life once in a while, you will find this story interesting."
3,the alchemist,"The Alchemist is about a shepherd boy who is content with his life. Until he starts having visions of treasure then one day he meets king who tells him he must fulfill his personal legend. So he gives up everything he has and goes on his journey, and the end the Journey brings him much more then the actual treasure he goes out in search of."
3,I wish I was Santiago...,"The main character, named Santiago, goes on a journey where he discovers how to be one with the world. He finds his purpose in life, with the help of an old man, and he follows through with his course of action, no matter what happens. The only problem I had with this book was its applicability. I liked the story, and I think Coelho makes a good point to look out for signs in life. But as far as how I felt after I finished the book, I was wishing that I had not read it. I am easily inspired, and this book can be inspiring. But to do what? Drop everything in your life to pursue your dreams? That is what I would like to do, but I have a common problem that is called obligations. The book made me feel like if I didn't drop everything and do something now, I would be eternally unhappy. However, if you are not easily inspired, the story will leave you with happy memories. I recommend it."
4,"Inspirational, if not completely original","This is a well-written, easy-to-read parable about a shepherd boy who sets out to find his ""Personal Legend,"" or dream in life. His travels take him from Spain into northern Africa, across the Sahara and into Egypt. Along the way, he meets fortune tellers, dessert dwellers, soldiers, crystal makers, his dream girl and an alchemist among others. He faces all sorts of unexpected obstacles and runs into a variety of characters who have given up their dreams and settled for more a comfortable life. It's a classic story, full of bits of wisdom, and although none of the insights are entirely original, the story packages them nicely. It teeters on the edge of New Age spirituality on occasion, but for the most part the spirituality is just a mix of various religious traditions. Some people have said this book changed their life. I wouldn't suggest that, necessarily, but it's certainly well worth the few hours it takes to read it."
5,Fantastic book!,Really interesting to read and worth every penny. There are plenty of life lessons locked away within its pages and it's easy to read
3,The Alchemist,It was a good read. and delivered on time on my Kindle. I will download again on my kindle!!!I like the easy download and the price was great.
2,Not as good as I expected,"Some of my favorite quotes from the book:""Maybe God created the desert so that man could appreciate the date trees."" (pg. 91)""It's the simple things in lie that are the most extraordinary; only wise men are able to understand them."" (pg. 15)""The hand of God is firm, but infinitely generous."" (preface, pg. vi)A quote I did not agree with:""We only accept a truth after we have first wholeheartedly rejected it."" (preface, pg. vi)"
5,An Inspiring Story,"I enjoy its simple and easy way of telling a inspiring story, which reminding me I'm capable to live out life in my own way. ""Life will never be the same"" as it said."
2,Dorothy got there first!,"I agree with the person who called this book psychobabble. The story rambles and pretty much goes nowhere--old bromides in an reused package. This journey was an unsuccessful vehicle to deliver the wisdom of the ages. Dorothy discovered There's no place like home! on the way to Oz in a much more compelling story. So did the friends she picked up along the way. People who like the fantasy genre would undoubtedly enjoy it more than I did. A waste of time; good thing it was so short. Two stars because it was totally clean, otherwise only one."
1,You can read most of this book for free!,"I posted a comment on this book several weeks ago, and it was never printed. Strange. Anyway, I was very disappointed with this book. Why? Because most of the reviews in this book are from the last 15 years. And you can download and read these reviews for free on Roger's web site!I have to wonder if Roger did this for commerical considerations, in order to have the book appeal more to consumers. If so, shame on you, Roger. It's also strange that there are a number of movies rated around ** or so - which makes calling the book ""I Hated Hated etc."" somewhat inappropriate. I know for a fact that there are several ""no stars"" movies he didn't include here, which makes me wonder if he planned for a sequel in order to make more money. If so, shame on you, Roger.The older reviews were fun to read, but as I've indicated earlier, there should have been more of a balance."
3,"Excellent, but could have waited","This book should have waited one more year; 2001 was an excellent year for bad movie reviews. Even though I didn't agree with 1 or 2 of these movie reviews, namely ""The big hit,"" you can't help but love it. Also, 2 star movies do not belong in a book with a title like ""I hated, hated, HATED this movie."
2,This was like reading a slate for a sit-com,While I enjoyed the book to a certain extent it didn't win me over. I read William Corlett's other book (NOW AND THEN) which is a much better book (5 Stars). This is just 'ok'. I wouldn't run out & recommend it very strongly. There were a bit too many characters for my liking. It was a cute concept of a gossip-ridden little village somewhere in England--which seems rather realistic (in parts). Enjoy...if you need to.
2,Gay SitCom in Need of Serious Editing,"The premise of this book is funny enough...a slightlymismatched gay couple buys a mansion in a small Englishcountry village next door to a homophobic retiredbrigadier general. Unfortunately, this cute premise is diluted by theauthor's introduction of far too many characters andsubplots that go nowhere and a writing style that feelsas if the author was being paid by the page. There areentire chapters that have no laughs, no insight, andno significance to the main plot. Boil this book downto half of its length, and it would be a winner."
5,Great controller!,"Oddly, when reviewing Amazon asks me ""How much fun is this game?"" and ""How do you rate this game overall?"". So I gave the controller 5 stars in both counts...eh.This is a great economy controller for the PS2. I purchased this for niece and nephew to use and they use this all the time now instead of the stock PS2, but maybe that's because it's old. However, I like that they are testing out the durability factor for me and I can say I'm happy. It seems to be very well made and sturdy all around. I didn't need the Seattle Mariners theme but just wanted something cheap and hopefully of high quality...scored a good one. Only non-standard issue is the start/select is on top so you basically extend the fingers that are on the shoulder buttons to press them."
3,Not as expected,The sound of this CD is not so great. I probably wouldn't have bought it had I known the sound quality was so marginal.
3,CD Review,"I enjoyed the CD but didn't realize a lot of the tracks are studio recordings of different takes on the music rather than a ""Greatest Hits"" album.."
2,Boring as hell....,"....cannot understand how anyone could compared this one with Miguel Migs 'Colorful You', nothing in common. This is music for sleep, nothing else. Miguel's is for happiness and joy."
2,One of Dick's weaker books,"Phil Dick is my favorite writer, but of the 15 books I've read by him, this is my least favorite. The plot is confused and the characters, never a strong point in PKD's books, are one-dimensional at best. The title of the book, which seems to be related to entropy, reality, and the notion of saving grace, is given very little treatment. These notions could have made for a great novel, but the ideas are not even half-fleshed out."
2,Not the best Dick,I like PKD but I did not like Ukib. The writing seemed amateurish and because of this I assumed it must have been one of his first novels (it isn't). None of the characters have any depth and in fact many are so poorly developed that they are hard to tell apart. The science fiction ideas in Ubik aren't especially interesting. I recommend you don't bother with this until you've read Dick's other major works.
1,Don't bother,Don't believe what you read about the bookIt sucksCharacters aren't well developedNeither is the universe that surrounds themGo read something else
4,Ubik is Unique,Entertaining and quite enjoyable. A bit of humor is mixed in. He certainly had a unique way of describing the scene and characters.
5,A Bizarre Look at...,"Death? Reality? Salvation? I can't describe exactly what is so compelling about this novel. I read it twice, and the second time I was shocked at the strangeness of the whole thing. The tone is somewhat humorous and sad, and the style is not exactly breathtaking. Yet UBIK has the essential feel of greatness that any masterpiece does. It is simply indescribable. I have given one of my old paperback copies to a friend for his perusal, and I would highly recommend this novel to anyone--not just PKD or science fiction fans--but anyone who wants to read something so uniquely different that they will be able to say, ""What the hell was that! """
4,Safe if taken as directed.....,"Not my usual reading fare, thus I was a bit lost for the first few chapters.Then the pace changed and the novel morphed and emerged with humor, wit, and surprises that were quite brilliant.Sci-Fi aficionados will be highly entertained!Take only as directed....Susanne"
2,Not a good value,"For the money, I expected this ring to be fairly high quality, but 3 of the side stones fell out in the first month of wearing. If you know a jeweler who can check the setting of each stone, and you really like the style, then get it. But have the jeweler check it out before you start wearing it."
1,cz wedding ring,"This ring was very disappointing, I guess you do get what you pay for, it was very cheap looking and it turned my finger green. The inside started peeling within the first 2 weeks. The cz looks cloudy and like plastic."
3,lesbian revolutionaries on the run,"yeah, its dated alright. I suppose gritty realism means mentioning tampons, menstruation and cramps each chapter. boring beginning, picks up by the end as the women are on the run after the house the group was living in is demolished in an accidental explosion. Spray painting graffiti is one thing. Blowing up govt. bldgs can come back and bite."
2,very mediocre,"This is a very bland story with uninterestng characters and a twist at the end that elicits a yawn and a ""ho, hum."" It has naieve dialogue that is almost embarassing, and awkward efforts to be eloquent and descriptive that utterly fail. I hope ""McBain"" and his 87th got a lot better by novel number 50. I have no interest in finding out. For the folks who liked this one, and I see there are quite a few, I have only one suggestion for dated police stories that still work today - Raymond Chandler."
5,great DVD,This is a great addition to any DVD collection. I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone who likes this TV series.
3,"It's good, not great","I watch a lot of good TV and was pretty excited to give Flashpoint a try after reading all of the other reviews on Amazon. After watching the first two episodes, I can say that Flashpoint doesn't grab me as other series I have seen.It might not be fair to pass judgement without watching the entire season, but after watching other series like Nip/Tuck, Lost, Prison Break, Entourage, and The Shield (which is definitely the best police drama out there), I'm not stuck to my seat watching every episode in the box. To be honest, I will watch the rest of this season because the show itself is entertaining, but it doesn't hold anything to TV series I have mentioned above.Also, no SWAT team in the world would ever go into encounters without EYE PROECTION. Little details like this drive me bananas. I know the show omitted shooting glasses and tactical goggles to keep the emotions of the character's faces visible, but lack of detail to realistic action sequences taint the show for me."
3,"perfect look for Fall, lacks durablity","I purchased these to use in the Autumn/Winter. They look great on the table at Thanksgiving. They are a good size; not too big or small. Durable, except I've had some trouble w/ tiny cracks in the glossy finish of some dinner plates. 2 plates even broke in half while in the microwave! I heard Sango customer service is helpful in getting free replacements. I will definitely check that out before replacing my own."
5,Lovely dinnerware,Sanyo Nova in Black is lovely. The shading enhances the shape and is very appealing to the eye. This was purchased as a gift for our daughter.
2,Too delicate for daily use,"I purchased this set for daily use and after a few months of use there are chips on the edges of 2 large plates, 2 bowls and 1 coffee mug. The spots that are chipped look terrible since the material under the brown coating is white. Even though I love the look of all the pieces in the dinnerware set, I do not recommend it as an everyday set since it is not holding up well with regular use."
1,Bad to the point of being dangerous,"We've had these for about seven years. For the past two years or so, we've been dealing with the fact that some of these dishes get so hot that they get hotter than the food. It's pretty random. We think the finish on them gets worn to the point that the material soaks up moisture which then gets blazingly hot in the microwave. We've finally gotten to the point where we're replacing them specifically for this reason. When I say hot, I mean that I cooked something the other day and, even though the food wasn't quite hot enough yet, the plate burned my hand to the point of having some pretty pink skin. Plus, some of them have cracked during microwave use. While your mileage may vary, I cannot recommend these dishes."
1,"Looks good, lasts little","It looks nice, but within a year the plates started cracking in the middle and two of them broke in half in the microwave. They also chip easily. Not recommended."
2,"Look nice, but...","These dishes look very nice on your table, but they have many problems.After about a year, my plates started cracking, directly above the ridge on the bottom. Same with the bowls.I have never been able to use them in the microwave because the item becomes very hot while the food is lukewarm.If they bump each other while running the dishwasher, they chip. At least, when I put them in they are ok, but they are chipped when I take them out."
2,I was happy until,"2 years ago I purchased these dishes, I was so happy with them that I would of given them a 5 star....Until 6 months ago. All of a sudden my dinner plates are breaking in half (these dishes are microwave safe, and no children) all have broken in the same place... 2 broke when picking up, 4 have broken while microwavingyet all my cups,bowls,salad,square plates are still in perfect condition.. But without my dinner plates, my set(s) are useless!!!"
1,No Durability - crack in the microwave and chip during regular use!,"I had very high hopes for these dishes. First, the color was inconsistent. Then, within two weeks, I had two chipped bowls. Now, very often I notice cracks after using them in the microwave (and they stay incredibly hot). I am so disappointed."
1,Very disappointed with this product since it is not original.,I was very excited when I ordered this product until I received it. It is very obvious this is not the original brand of Sango. I already have this same set that I purchased at Macy's and it is much more heavier and the colors are completely different. I am very disappointed with this product since it is not original. The plates are not heavy like the original ones that I own which means the quality is poor. I regret purchasing this set from here and not from Macy's once again. I didn't return it since I didn't want to deal with the whole shipping deal.
3,Pretty but fragile,"Sango Nova Brown 16-Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4These dishes are very attractive but we purchased this 16 piece set to replace dishes that had broken from our original set. They don't chip but seem to break in half, especially the dinner plates. Microwaving seems to exacerbate the problem"
4,Pretty and functional - becoming a little fragile,"I bought 3 sets of the Nova Black dishes about 6 years ago and love them. They are functional and pretty. In four years of daily use, I only lost 1 mug to a boken handle - my fault.Then suddenly over the last year, the dishes began to break and chip.At least 3 of my bowls and 1 plate have aquired large white chips along the edges while washing in the dishwasher, and I have lost 2 plates - cracked right down the middle!!! Also, as another reviewer noted, I am also starting to see permanent stains and discoloration in the center of the bowls and plates themselves.So I am on here looking for replacements.They are so pretty it would be a shame to not have the full sets..... though after reading the other reviews, I wonder if the quality of these dishes may be the issue, more than my current dishwasher.I wish they sold just the plates and bowls. I don't need more mugs."
3,It's just OK,"My husband and I got married over 6 years ago and we got 2 sets of 4 placesettings. Many of the plates have chipped, a few have broken. I was most disappointed with the baking dishes. I had both the square baker and the lasagne pan. Within 3 years they developed large cracks and then broke. I'm in the market for new placesettings with a focus on durability."
3,Different than original,These are similar in look but actually larger in diameter that the originals yet close enuff
4,Fun music!,I have other cd's from this collection and they are all great. Add this to your cataloge along with a few of their other offerings.
1,Poor sound and video quality,"Like all of the videos from Traders Library and Marketplace books, This is taped by amatures with chincy equipment in a noisey poor acoustic conference room at a Las Vegas hotel and the sound and visuals will show this. I highly recommend to avoid any and all of these products due to their inferior quality and poor production which shows in everyone made."
4,Assembly required!,"You should have a decent amount of patience before attacking the assemblage of this. However, once complete, it looked GREAT and is very functional for things like gloves, scarves, woolly socks, etc. Make sure you have two vertical extensions that are 22"" apart or you will have difficulty fitting this in..."
5,He still loves the life.,Wise guy what a book. The story of Henry hill his life in the Mob. All what he knows and did. The friends he had the ones he lost. How he got out and lives on. Just had to read it over and over again. What really went on in his life. It feels like that you are inside his mind.
5,Very entertaining. A must read !,"This is a good book about one of the LSN's soldiers, from the Lucchese Family. This book is about Henry Hill's personal life. Why and how he chose the life he led for so many years. If you watched the movie Goodfellas, which was based on this book, you must read the book to fully understand Henry's point of view. Definitely recommended."
4,Very detailed!,"This is a book that puts an impression on you. It makes you wonder who really has control and who really has the power in this country. As always, the book is always better than the movie. There is more detailed information about Henry Hill's involvement with organized crime (compared to the movie equivalent 'Goodfellas') and it is very insightful into the lifestyle of the mob. Everyone should read this book."
3,The best Mafia book written,"The details on mob life in this book are second to none, but I did not find it as emotionally involving as The Westies by T.J. English. Donnie Brasco is also a terrific book. But I was blown away by the realism in Pilleggi's writing. The book is even better than the movie Goodfellas, and that's saying a lot."
4,Good Read,"A good, but not great read. The movie was much better. The book narrative just never seemed to point to an ending."
2,too much emotion and breathing!,"I was attracted to this artist b/c ""fallen for you"" on the ""High Fidelity"" soundtrack is a gorgeous song. I love the lamenting, the emotion, the moaning, the heavy breathing etc. The problem is that for 3 minutes it is okay, for 40 minutes it is overkill.The songs all sound alike, the production and instrumentation is the same for every song. There is no dispartity on this cd. It gets monotonous.""Fallen for You"" is enough from this artist!"
5,my first psych book....,"....which I bought as a bored college student and loved. Penetrating character analysis by an ex-student of Freud who developed her own theory of neurosis...and her own emphasis on the capacity for what she called ""wholeheartedness."" A bit technical in places but invaluable."
1,Inaccurate,"I walk pretty much the same distance daily, and this device gave me wildly different readings for the same route. I could see being off by even 100 steps for variations in stride, etc. But off by thousands of steps? Hardly worth it."
3,Pretty good addition in the never-ending Ultra-Lounge series...,"The Ultra-Lounge series is of course limited to album tracks and singles on the Capitol label, and cobbling together so many different styles of lounge music is bound to create both excitement and dissension, but ""TV Town"" plays very smoothly, with hardly any ringers, and features some rare, collectible sides besides! Peggy Lee's ""Bewitched"" is quite a find(for the record, ""I Dream of Jeannie""'s theme had lyrics too, but it wasn't on Capitol). Nelson Riddle's ""Naked City"" is a corker, as are Dave Pell's ""Thanks for the Memory"" and Jack Marshall's ""The Munsters""(a jazzier, yet more toned down version than the theme you hear on TV). Liberty Orch.'s ""Burke's Law Suite"" is too long but has its moments, and John Barry's ""Human Jungle"" is very intriguing. A nice addition to the series, with another booklet full of great colorful photos."
3,so so.....,The tracks are pretty much intact.......don't expect anything like Verve Remixed. Id like to suggest The Jazz Influence Vol 1 & 2.
4,Rollin IS the genre,"This film embodies a lot of why i find these Euro horror/sleaze films so interesting.The way its filmed,the camera seems hand-held all the way through!!Just for some of the imagery this film is worth it.The abbatoir at the start,the infamous Brigitte Lahaie with sythe scene,when the main character(i forget his name-but who cares!!)is running up to the castle its very eerie with the washed-out,watercolours of the woodland behind him. Lahaie really makes this film stand out for me,she is BEAUTIFUL. Aestheticly this film really is a treat to watch.Im now hooked on Rollin,im getting Living Dead Girl next!!"
2,A poser at best,"We all know that Swiss Cake Rolls will never achieve the delicious status enjoyed by Yodels, but I really do give them an A for effort. The major complaint with these snacks is that they are just too dry. They attempt to surround creme filling with some kind of chocolate cake, but the result comes off as a cheap tasting joke. I don't really have any advice for Little Debbie to improve this product, though. They should simply leave it up to the experts at Drake's Snack Foods."
5,It's Amazing What I Didn't Know,"This book was an eye-opener to say the least. I thought I understood the Constitution and how the government worked, but every few pages I learned something new."
1,NEVER RECEIVED THIS ITEM,"never came, was nto ordere4d. Did ya charge me for it and not send it? this is a perpetual problem, with books and with KINDLE and I want my money back if you charged me for books not received."
1,Wrong cd recevied a cassette.,I bought a cassette(Happy holidays to you by The Whispers) and thought I was getting a cd but I bought the wrong item. Tried to contact the seller but to no succcess. So the customer service rep. has signed me up for the a-z program. So this experiniece was not good. ButI will be paid back the amount owed.
3,"good read, not too helpful","great read for entertainment value, but the author goes all over the place and it's hard to keep track of his thoughts... also many of his dates and other factual info were off. full of great ancidotes, but for Jack Benny/radio age term paper reserch (as it was used), it wasn't very helpful. a good read for someone who's read everything elese... a much better, excellent book is 'sunday nights at seven' by jack and joan benny, instead."
5,Worth the $$$$,"Pretty cool film about strippers. Gives insight into the industry and especially the dancers. All the dancers in the movie are pretty hot (redhead, blondes and brunettes, oh my!). The best is Ashlyn Gere and Amy Lynn Baxter from Howard Stern fame. There are extras on this dvd of them doing oil shows, shower shows and dancing. The film is one hour plus all the extras (probably another 30 minutes of just nakedness). The other film on the dvd is a (...) flick which is actually quite amusing."
4,Does what it is supposed to but...,I bought this to protect my new nook. I have to say that the film for the larger screen was harder to install than I thought. My main piece of advice is to make sure that the reading screen is super clean before you install the protector. It is almost impossible to clean lint off of the sticky part and when you lift it off - unless you are super careful - it will leave a little kink in the film and it won't stick in that spot. As you can probably tell - I am going to have to get another one. The smaller film for the touch screen was a lot easier to get on and went on nicely. If this happens to you - you can buy just the film for the reading screen by getting the screen protector for the Kindle 2. I hope you have better luck than I did...
1,Not worth the bother,"This is a problematic game. The concept isn't new, but it's a formula that works, generally. In this case, however, the controls are so jumpy that getting your character to go where you want is difficult to impossible. I'm pretty good at computer games, and I couldn't get past the second level. Not good!To add insult to injury, the game tries to install a nasty little piece of spyware when you install. My spyware checker caught it, but knowing it tried incensed me all the same. Out it goes!"
1,didn't like it.,didn't like it that much it wasn't want I had expexted it be I thought it might be something differen't
1,Leave alone,Don't bother with this game. Go with 'Burger Shop' instead. First when installing this eGames will put you through a 20 minute survey they require you to fill out. Then I couldn't get the game installed properly it kept telling me to set graphics control. I contacted support and he wanted me to send via email a whole slew of things that I just gave up. Now I have a game I can't use.
5,Ut2004 what a rush.,I just picked up this game after playing ut2003 to death and it's a whole new ball game.The graphics are much better and game play so smooth.lots more servers also couldn't be more satisfied with the game and im glad amozon carries a huge selection of older and newer games.
4,So many typographical errors,"I am always surprised how many typographical errors Kindle books contain. This one is no different. There is a high rate of typo's and grammatical errors. How does this happen with Kindle books and not books in print?However, this does not degrade the wonderful storytelling of this author."
3,Thin tablecloth,"The vinyl is very thin. Not pleased with the quality. However, the design worked. So technically, it did the job."
3,"An ""okay"" Heart compilation...","Good collection of their earlier hits from the 70's and early 80's comprising of their own songwriting and music. Before the commercially-driven 80's where they were fed other songwriters' tunes (i.e. Diane Warren, Holly Knight, etc.). I give this compilation 3/5 stars for two reasons: 1.) they didn't need to include the A/C ""Strong Strong Wind"" and 2.) they didn't include the original hit version of ""Dreamboat Annie"". Instead they include the reprise version, which isn't bad but it's slower and sounds a little depressing. Otherwise, if you're a fan of Heart's earlier music, get this compilation or spend the extra $$$ and purchase ""The Essential Heart"", which has all of their hits from 70's, 80's and early 90's."
4,A very good book,"This book does everything right: it introduces the reader to a new world, it has a tight plot and engaging characters, and it uses emotion effectively. Tony Beach is, in his own eyes, a coward and a failure. Both his father and grandfather were distinguished military men, while he, after years of searching for something he can be good at, has settled into a modestly comfortable life as a wine merchant. As the story opens, Tony is still grieving for the death of his wife, whom he loved very much, and he is still living under the shadows of his great forebears. In the course of the story, however, Tony is able both to come to terms with his loss and to discover strengths of his own. The crimes described in the story are not pretty, but the story is about more than crime. My favorite part of the book is the ending, where Tony finds out that he has more in common with his father than he ever thought."
2,It's all in the details,"A reasonably good mystery that was somewhat tempered by one annoying fact - the author had obviously never used plaster of paris before, or understood how it is to be used. This grated throughout what would have otherwise been a good book - a solid mystery with a bunch of different pieces that converge and fall into place quite nicely at the end. In the end, a small slip-up will probably cause me not to read any more of his books. It's like the author of Deadly Doses: A Writer's Guide to Poisons put it - if you're going to poison someone, make sure you do you homework. This should hold true for any method of murder... Also, he mentioned the Elephant Child and the Limpopo River, and in reading that text, I'm not at all sure it actually had the implications he meant!"
2,Not worth it.,"There are a few thing at the beginning that helps a little. There is a part on what the mountain man wore. There is a section that lets you know what the modern day person is up to wearing leather. The brain tanning is not that great and if you want to do it, please look for another source. There are great books and DVDs that are a much more into the brain tanning. I was thinking that this book was about clothing that was wore before white mans influence. Why is it that everybody thinks that the only thing that the Plains Indian man wore was a War shirt. The good thing that you will learn is how to tan with Ivory Soap."
1,Another So So Microsoft product,"I purchased the disk version to eliminate download time because of my slow dial-up USP. It turned out after loading the disk I had to go on line and it downloaded the product. 45 minutes later it started and did it's thing. I then started having problems with the internal Fax that had never happend before. Long story short, other little problems and flags about updates and 2 hours of service tech's in various parts of the world, I decided to restore my PC to the day before my MS mistake. $25 dollars in the trash ."
1,Worst software purchase ever,"On my one PC MS Windows Live OneCare crashes upon bootup. On my other computer I can't send/receive email without turning off the firewall even though MS Outlook is set to allow access to the internet. Sure you have free support, but the support is worthless. All they do is blame the problem on other software on your computer even though your computer was working great until you loaded their software. The free products you can find on the internet work better than this software that you have to pay for."
1,Terrible for dial up,"There is no program on the disk, All files must be downloaded, 4 Hours, Would never buy this again!!!!"
2,Automatic? Not so fast!,"The key word in evaluating this product is the word ""automatic"". There is little or nothing in the way of manual options or manual control in this program. Turn your computer off for a few weeks (perhaps you have a laptop that you only use when you travel, as I do).Then - when you turn the computer on, OneCare comes on automatically and wants to do its thing - updating, ""tuneup"", etc. Just too bad if you'd like to use your computer for your own purposes - you'll just have to wait a couple of hours while OneCare does its thing.And, as of November 14, OneCare expects you to use the new Browser version - Explorer 7. Don't like the new browser? Too bad. OneCare likes it and wants it and you get a yellow alert warning you of marginal security if you don't immediately download Explorer 7. Again, there is no manual override or personal choice in the matter."
4,Great value for my money..!!!,I like the way the one care works.. You can still do your stuff while tune-up is in progress..
5,"So far, its just right for us....","We really like it. Its the right size for us, we like the fact that its real wood, we like its natural wood finish, it was pretty easy to assemble, it is sturdy, it's well balanced, so its not threatening to fall over, and finally, it was a good value. The price was reasonable. The delivery to Southern California was reasonably prompt, and my wife, a Canadian, likes the fact that the company has a factory in British Columbia."
1,Complete ignorance,"This author lacks knowledge of the most basic concepts of evolution. From the very beginning, the theory of evolution predicted altruism.You have to love the picture of the little child. Poor boy, being deluded by evilution.Science doesn't teach us anything about morality. Learning about science is no threat to morality. Read a book by Dawkins; I promise it will not make you selfish or callous towards other humans."
3,Pretty Good Certianaly Not The Greatest Debut OF All time....,"Boston another one of those ""stadium rock"" bands from the 70s that now a days are long broken up and or not touring and currently realising skimpy hits complimation cds for low prices(8.97, 6.97 or lower) anyways Boston's debut album is probaly there best album and the only one you need of them. Huge success when it came out and is one of those great debut albums that are hard too find but people look whats better, Are You Experienced by The Jimi Hendrix Experience a classic great rock album or Bostons first album. Puh leeze people come on and please comment on this review if you disagree otherwise. These guys had a few hits that are still popular today, ""More Than A Feeling"", etc. Over all a good album buy today"
5,"BOSTON RULES!! DON""T LISTEN TO THAT GARGOYLE!!","ATTENTION!! PAY NO MIND TO THE NEGATIVE HATEFUL TROLL NAMED JON LAYTON THAT JUST CRAWLED OUT FROM UNDER A BRIDGE AND DECIDED TO CRY LIKE A BABY ABOUT BOSTON!! BOSTON IS WITHOUT A DOUBT 1 OF THE GREATEST BANDS OF ALL TIME!! EVERY ALBUM THEY HAVE DONE IS KILLER!! POSITIVE, UPLIFTING, HIGH SPIRITED FUN!! INCREDIBLE MELODIES, AWESOME LYRICS, BEAUTIFUL LOVE SONGS, MASTERFUL MUSICIANSHIP, AND EXCELLENT VOCALS!! GIVE IT UP DUDE! GO BACK TO YOUR NEGATIVE, HATEFUL, LIFE IN THE SEWER!! BOSTON FOREVER!!"
3,2 CHANNEL STEREO ONLY...,DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A MULTICHANNEL HI-RES TRACK - NOT HERE. MAYBE THEY WILL TRY AND PUT ONE TOGETHER ON A DVD-AUDIO DISK??? MY BASIC CD VERSION SOUNDS THIS GOOD. DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$$$........ LIKE I DID...
3,"Way better than your snobby ""alternative"" bands","I angers me the way music snobs write this album off as ""dated"" and ""cheesy arena rock"". Do you arena rock haters realise that one of your ""cool"" alternative bands ripped off a Boston song? Listen to ""More than a Feeling"" (1976), then listen to Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" (1991). The riffs are almost identical. Arena rock bands are way more talented than alternative bands. Why do you think they have to steal their songs?"
4,Classic,I needed to beef up this genre in my iPod. And this was a great option. It also has several great running songs on it that I hadn't thought of before.
2,"Fool me once, shame on you","...This had the SACD logo sticker on the cover and the way the logo is designed, implied that this was in 5:1. Shame on you. It is in stereo. I have always enjoyed this album that came out when I was in high school and have a stereo copy already. When I saw it in the SACD section of Best Buy, I thought it would be the livin end to have it in surround sound! It was a severe disappointment to see that it says Stereo in small letters on the back after I had opened it already. If I hadn't opened it, I would have returned it. Why bother putting out a SACD if it is only in stereo???"
4,Well Worth Buying Due To Remastering.,"This debut album in 1976 came at a time when punk rock was taking off in the UK, so this was a very welcome repost and provided some of the best classic rock ever made.More Than A Feeling and Peace Of Mind are fantastic for starters, Foreplay/Long Time follows, then another highlight, Rock & Roll Band.Smonkin' is not as good, but Hitch A Ride is another out of the top drawer.Finally Something About You and Let Me Take take You Home Tonight are a little less precise rock than my preferred songs.Having said all that, easily 4 stars and the follow up, Don't Look Back, carried on in the same vein and possibly out performed this one."
5,The REAL begining of Rock,"I am a simple guy with big needs in music. Boston definetly fills those needs. From the magnificent harmonies, to crazy guitar licks, this cd just gets better. With the soft to high sounds of MORE THAN A FEELING and PEACE OF MIND, to crazy keyboarding/guitar beats of FOREPLAY/LONG TIME, SMOKIN', and ROCK AND ROLL BAND, this proves that Rock N' Roll definetly was the gauntlet of music, and Boston was the Rock of the Ages.TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!"
2,agree with everyone else on here,"I just purchased my sacd player and picked up Boston and Billy Joel's the Stranger at the same time. After listening to the Stranger, my mouth dropped. Billy's voice coming from the center speaker and all the other instruments and melodies coming from every different direction. Then I put in Boston and couldn't tell a difference from the cd version I already own. I think it's one of the best albums, but if you already own it on cd, don't bother upgrading - there's nothing special about the SACD version."
2,"Love the music, but only plays out of 2 speakers","I love this album by Boston. I bought it in SACD format, but it's nothing like the other SACD's I bought. It only plays out of 2 speakers and my sub. It sounds ""okay"", but I was pretty disappointed. Nothing comes out of the center channel and the rear speakers. What's with that?"
5,Great cd,Great remaster job on this album. A remastered rendition of this in a dvd would not be a bad idea.
2,*Not whats shown!,"I ordered what was in the pic and I was ok with whatever color I got. What I got? A black , plain hard case half the size! I like what we got, but obviously we ran out of storage room fast...."
5,Simple but complete recipes,"This book is easy to read and simple to use, but has all the good information you need to cook for your dog. They even break up the recipes based on the weight of your dog so you don't have to figure it out yourself. There is a basic nutrition breakdown for each recipe. Once you know what you're doing, you'll probably want to get some more complicated books about canine nutrition to start making up your own recipes; but this is a great book to get you started."
1,Stay away from this book!,"This book has several recipes in it for different weight dogs. Most of them have some sort of wheat and/or corn products in them. Any of you who are trying to feed your dog good food will know that many dog are allergic to wheat and corn. I tried one recipe for one serving for my 10 pound dog and it made so much that it fed my two 10 pound dogs and my 25 pound dog for 3 meals, and they didn't really like it to begin with."
3,Better Food for Dogs: A Complete Cookbook and Nutrition Guide,There is a lot of reading material and fairly complicated recipes - too many ingredients. Recipes require a lot of shopping for ingredients you would not use regularly.
4,good book for the price,"I bought this as a gift and was impressed by the number of animals in it, the compact size, and the pictures. I'd recommend this product for any child who is an animal enthusiast"
4,keeps my thermostart secured and locked,"I bought it since a few of my kids were playing around with my thermostat, and its very good, locks good but the same as the previous review wrote that the key is very cheap and I don't understand why it couldn't come with 2 keys so me and my wife could have one... Anyway, it serves the purpose!"
4,Seiko Review,"The only flaw that I find with this watch is setting up the month, date and time information. There are not clear instructions on the different choices or in how it is done, other than that is an excellent watch."
4,The Complete John Waite,"This is a great collection of his songs. I'm not a huge huge fan or anything and honestly I only bought it cause I wanted one song but I was surprised at how many songs I remembered form his time with Bad English. Overall, a good cd."
3,"Not ""Complete""","A good disc, but a couple of key omissions for sure. Where is ""Every Time I Think of You"" and ""Tears?"" These are two Waite classics, definitely worthy of inclusion in this 17 song composite. Heck, anyone who is a John Waite fan would have no problem shelling out a buck or two more to have a more appropriate ""complete"" collection. Aside from this blunder, the disc provides good listening, with John's addictive voice and sharp hooks."
5,A Must-Have For CHF Patients & Their Families,"My husband was diagnosed with Congestive Heart Failure recently. Although we haven't had the book for very long, it has already made an impact! In addition to the great writing, it also has plenty of specific tips, treatments (even experimental ones), and even questions to ask your doctor. We'll probably even bring the book with us to his next appointment. While physical health is a focus, Dr. Silver also addresses the mental health of a patient and his/her family by discussing issues with anger and depression that sometimes follow a diagnosis of CHF."
4,"Awesome, but I'm too quiet to try, heheh.","I personally thought it was a cool book, full of advice and lots of the usual good stuff ;) I love how it was full of opinion and tips of what voters like and don't like. The person who thinks it's bad -- well, I think there was something else on his/her mind that kept him/her from seeing the full book ;) It's a little inspiring but I don't see myself as one who would run. ;)"
4,A bit expensive but a good quality watch,"I got this watch for my girlfriend who is a nurse and running around all day. So far (3 months) the watch has held up well, one of the springs on the bands popped out but was easily popped back into place."
5,Winds of Creation,"This band is amazing. When they recorded this album their drummer was only 16, the bassist 18 and singer and guitarist only 19. Not to mention they wrote half of this stuff when they were 13 and 14! It's unbelievable. Amazing compositions, none of those [bad] lyrics, virtuoso guitar work, this has everything and it will pound the ... out of you at the same time. This is so much better than ""Nihility"" in song writing and production (not to mention this has far better guitar solos). Don't be fooled by thier young age, this is some of the most intricate metal I've heard in a long time, perhaps ever! Buy this album if you like technical death metal, good songwriting and for proof that their is a future for extreme music. ....Highlight of ""Winds of Creation"" - ""Human's Dust"""
3,Three Men on he Bummel,Having read Three Men in a Boat years ago found this one not quite as entertaining. Interesting though. Perhaps because I wasn't well when I read it I am a shade prejudiced.I like his style.
2,"Re-read ""Three Men in a Boat"" instead","After reading Three Men in a Boat (a five-star for me), I was eager for this one. What a disappointment...Maybe only three pages are really funny, the book is simply boring at many passages. I should've reread 3MiaB instead.<<< SPOILER ALERT >>>AND, to top it all - Montmorency is missing!"
3,"Good taste, way too hard.","If you like Werther's hard candies, you may like these. The pretty good caramels. But they are hard, and really sticky. Like ""do I have all my fillings?"" sticky.Eating a bag now. But I wanted caramels, and these really aren't. The are closely related, but so different, in terms of texture.Not my cup of tea. If you like your caramels really hard (not hard candy hard, but still), you may love these. If you think caramels should be soft and chewy, you may not.Now, I just tried warming them up, and that really helped. Almost tempted to raise it up to 4 stars. Don't microwave it though. That turns them into a bubbling mass of goo!"
5,Fond memory,"I was in first grade in 1974, it was the first time our class went to the library. The librarian discussed with us some books she had picked out and one was, The five chinese brothers. By the time she had finished describing the book I knew what book I wanted to check out. And when she gave the permission to look around, I ran for that book, and I read it, read it, and am getting to read it again 24 years later. I dont exactly know how, but I feel somehow that book helped me be..who I am, because I never forgot that memory."
5,Excellent textbook...,"...comprehensive, detailed but nevertheless succinct and to the point...the writing is a bit dry but after all it is a textbook."
2,Movie is better..,"Rarely do I think a movie adaptation is better than the book, well that is not the case with this book. I actually enjoyed the movie far more than the book. Cee Cee was a little too crass for my taste, Michael was indeed a heartless bastard and Bertie was always wallowing in self-pity for not being able to be with the heartless swine of Michael. I wish the ending would have been more emotional, I felt the writer rushed Bertie's death. Overall, I didn't like the book as much as I thought I would."
3,Broken,"Unfortunately, one of the canisters in the set was broken when it arrived, so I sent it back. I requested that they send me another set instead of a refund, but I got an e-mail saying that a refund was on the way. Oh well!"
1,"Product 5 STARS, Packing -3 STARS, Hassle -1 STAR","Great looking set if it could arrive without being broken. Amazon simply throws an already poorly packaged box from the manufacturer into one of theirs and ships it out. Any rough handling at all resorts in the canisters banging each other and you end up with a broken box of ceramic. I've received two of those lovely surprises!Both the first set I ordered and its replacement set were damaged the same way. The canisters are packed one inside the other with a thin piece of cardboard separating them. Just imagine the UPS guy throwing the box or even setting it down hard. THEY BREAK!Amazon is good about issuing a credit or attemting replacement (in this case). It's like playing the lottery to see if you can receive these without breakage. Are you feeling lucky??? If so, then roll the dice. Good luck!"
4,Sango canister set,"The first shipment had a broken canister so we sent it back. The second was in perfect order. The colors are fine with my kitchen. However, I wish the third canister was a little bigger to hold more coffee before having to refill it."
2,Seal Leaves A Lot to Be Desired,"I bought these because they matched my dishes. I really wish I'd kept my old ones, even though they were black. The size of these is nice for flour, sugar, etc.; however, the rubber seals in them aren't great. The seal on my flour (biggest one) falls in every single time I take the lid off. They're pretty, but not very functional."
3,Could have been better...,"If you are buying this book for entertainment reading for your child you might be disappointed. I agree that the authors choice of words to provide imagery could have been thought out a little better for this age group (a child could easily get lost in the fluff) . I believe that for many readers it will only serve as a distraction and slow the story down. However, I used it as an opportunity to introduce my daughter to new words and ideas of expression and asked her to provide alternate ways to express the idea based on the definition. I liked the inclusion of the real landmarks and traditions as it provided some additional areas for us to explore."
1,Shallow,"I wonder if those people who rate this song so highly have actually really, really listened to it. The music is no bad, and that's the reason I guess that it's so popular, but the lyrics are so banal and shallow. ""She walks like she talks and she talks like she walks""...what's that supposed to mean? Doh! If these are the types of lyrics that Ricky likes to sing, then I dread to think what his next song will be like. But so many people, they really do not let lyrics of songs sink in, so they miss the real meaning of them. I would state the other lyrics in the song, but I am afraid Amazon will censor my review. It wouldn't be the first time."
3,Jane Fonda,"Not bad for folks that can't do full out aerobics, it's an ok workout. Jane Fonda is quite fit for her age."
4,Liked Trim & Tone & Flex,I am at the age when this workout works great for me - easy to follow and good instructions. Try to use it 3 time a wek.
4,All her video's,are great and specially if you are older and have health problems.It is very easy to do and you do something good for yourself.
3,"""improvements"" don't make it better","I bought an earlier version of this product for a friend's daughter a couple of years ago & it used to have more sounds/buttons to push. Now there is less of that & they've made the cat have fur. Well I got it for both my niece & daughter for their first birthdays and am disappointed in the change from the older version. I have a feeling the cat will soon be fur-less and simply hope they don't ingest the fur. I miss the other sounds it used to make and the new sounds are so quiet you can barely hear them. For a simple first doll house it's fine, but the included ""bells & whistles"" are lacking."
2,Work on your French and Russian skills,"One can often identify a bad film by a bad sound track. The music doesn't stink, but it is melodramatic, not memorable ... as, basically the storyline is. Yes, it must have been rather horrible to live in the USSR during the 1930's, but the utter lack of any insight into more underlying causes leaves me feeling like a Marxist film critic. Pretty simple story of good vs. bad, pretty simple use of supporting characters. Pretty simple husband and wife romantic and ideological conflict. Simple + easy = popular. And isn't it a little unrealistic how many of the Russians speak in what sounds to me like fluent impeccable french? Anyway, it could be worst, I don't find anything hillariously bad, the film is worked out fine for me as I used it to improve my knowledge of Russian and French."
2,Tale of nonsense,"This movie deals with the complex issue of postwar repatriation of immigrants from France to Russia with a 'healthy' charge of ignorance. All stalinist nightmares for some reason affect mainly a `poor French woman' and she suffers at length and endlessly through the movie. Brilliant actor Menshikov (Prisoner of the Mountains, Burnt by the Sun), rising star Bodrov (Brother, Brother 2) and episodic appearance by Catherine Deneuve can not save this cold-war style propaganda flick. Even a potentially strong theme of sacrifice made by the Menshikov's character is lost in the incoherent fable. The result is a farce. See it for curious historic bloopers and senseless dialogues."
2,Not the greatest movie,"To be honest, this could have been a good movie but sadly wasn't. Very slow moving and not funny what so ever.... I also think the 9/11 tie in was to just draw a bigger audience...... Don't buy it. Rent if it is the last thing available (even after checking out the cartoon section at the video store)."
4,3 and 3/4 stars,"The plot was a brilliant story and the characters were easy to relate to. There were just two problems.1. Neville was almost too perfect of a gentleman. It was almost as if he had no personality sometimes. But he was so very sweet.2. Too much detail. The story just dragged on and on. Nevertheless, this was a touching story that you shouldn't skip over."
2,Read any other Mary Balogh book but this one!,"This book was pretty bad. Granted, it's probably still much better than many other romances because it was written by Mary Balogh, and I have not been disappointed by any other book she's ever written, so my expectations were very high.Several other reviews detail why this book doesn't work, but mostly I found it a very frustrating read and hard to see why Lily would continue to like her 'husband'. Even though this is now part of a series, I would recommend skipping it. Get ""A Summer to Remember"" instead."
1,"Sorry guys, but it's a dog","This book is just way too basic.If you had never heard of a network before it might be useful, but even as a relative beginner I found this book to be _way_ too simpleminded.I like information to be presented in a non-technical, accessible way. This book manages to be irritatingly simplistic and unclear at the same time. Quite a feat.I was particularly disappointed because I've liked other books in the same series. I really doubt that anyone with any experience (even just surfing the internet) would find this book very useful.I hope the authors put a lot of effort into improving the next version, if there is another."
3,Good book,"The idiot's guide to networking is a good book ,although sometimes it turns out to be heavy. It should explain basics things like what is a LAN in a more understandable way.Leonard Loro"
5,Sophisticated silliness.,"Spike Jones combined his 1940s big band with vaudevillean puns, sound effects & other gags. He gave a demented twist to standards like ""Laura"" and ""Cocktails for Two."" He never fails to give me a giggle in this cynical, depressed fin-de-20th-siecle era. Think Weird Al Yankovich, circa 1945."
5,"""The Best Of Spike Jones"" CD","I've always been a huge fan of the absolutely whacky Spike Jones music. It's amazing that they've been able to reproduce many of these zany tunes in such a high state of quality. Even though Spike and his music were considered ""off the deep end"", every one of the people who worked with Spike were actually superb musicians who just appreciated being able to quote, unquote ""let go"" every once in a while with these goofy tunes. Even though the songs were done in a crazy manner (by design, obviously) if you listen to the performances on the instruments and the quality of the vocals, these were all people who clearly were very competent musicians and singers. All of them."
2,Running around..,"I felt the story too one-dimensional and constantly felt that I have read this story somewhere else, with different persons. I don't know if it's just because the story was too predictable or I have been getting deja vu a lot lately.G'Kar - Na'Toth - Garibaldi novel.The events take place before ""The Coming of Shadows""."
2,Just plain bad writing...,"This tale ties up a (very short) loose thread in the B5 universe, but otherwise it was simply a story that didn't need to be told. Apart from one scene in which Londo attends G'Kar's ""funeral"" ceremony -- which was emotionally effective and character-advancing, and probably came direct from JMS -- there wasn't really an emotionally compelling plot point anywhere in the novel.But the chief complaint is simply the quality of the writing. It's just flat Not Good.There are other good B5 books out there -- the techno-mage trilogy, for instance. Read them. Skip this one."
1,bad mixes,"only the 12"" clubmix of John Secada is ok ( of course, it is mixed by Tommy Musto), the rest is so outdated & cheesy!!."
5,A great study guide!,"Father Thomas Santa's Essential Bible Handbook offers expert guidance for Catholic Bible study activity.Father Santa, a popular author and teacher, reviews the history of the scriptures and the oral and literary traditions that underpin them. To facilitate study, he also provides helpful summaries of the major themes of each book of the Bible.He grounds the sacraments in scripture and provides citations. He offers helpful prayer techniques -- such as praying with scripture and praying with major biblical personalities --with suggestions on how to approach them. Other highlights include an eight day retreat plan and a beautiful scriptural rosary detailed with instructions in Chapter 9.The entire text is indexed to the Catechism of the Catholic Church by paragraph. Also, an extensive glossary is provided to help with further study.Father Santa's clear, straightforward style and easy expertise with this subject make this book very reader-friendly. It is a wonderful study guide!"
2,Not impressed,"A few days ago I bought the sisters' album Festival, and loved every single song. Based on that, I sampled all the songs on this album to see if I should download it. After hearing these songs, I definitely will not be purchasing this album. The girls are definitely beautiful, all right. It's easy to see why they're so well-loved because of it. But on this album, their voices haven't matured enough to enjoy listening to, no matter how pretty they are. Skip this album and move onto their later works, where they don't sing with little girl voices and their song selection is a little more mature."
1,It doesn't work,"I ordered two of these lamps, and one of them doesn't light up. I tried to reach customer service, but I haven't had the luck yet. I'll change the review in accordance to how quickly Adesso can help me resolve this issue."
4,"Good looks, but not for perfectionists.","As others have mentioned, it looks great from afar and with a 40-watt CFL it's able to provide ample ambient lighting for a mid sized room.You can get the $20, pre-fab/pre-assembled floor lamps at the local hardware store, but let's be honest they're pretty blah looking. This does look good.But if you are a perfectionist that can't stand if things don't align perfectly, you're probably going to end up returning this lamp. If you aren't bothered by that sort of thing (and only under close examination would this be noticed), you'll do just fine with this one.I like it."
3,3 stars,"the item looks attractive in the computor, but whenit arrived it had no directions on how to put it together.so i followed the picture on the box, i assembled it 3 times and took it appart three times because it was wrongfinally the next day we unscrewed all the pieces and realized the fabric needs to be held by something to stay in the frame.....all in all its up and pretty but it would have been nice if the manufacture put directions into box"
3,Nice,"Pros: Lamp is beautiful and lights the entire room (150W) with a soft glow. Shade doesn't get hot which will be nice this summer. Useful display shelves. Good assembly instructions. No damage during shipment, all the parts were there and delivered on time. Lamp has an Asian influence but goes well with my contempory/Scandinavian theme.Cons: Lamp is a little rickety but I expected that. Probably not a good choice if you have kids or big dogs. Wish the shade was bright white instead of off-white. Could have used it a couple of inches taller but I suppose that would have meant going to metal construction instead of wood.All in all, it's pretty, unusual and utilitarian so I'm keeping it."
4,The Great Pretender,"COLLECTION is a Germany import, which includes all the tracks from the ultra rare 1984 album THE GREAT PRETENDER, along with some extra tracks. THE GREAT PRETENDER included all sorts of songs that Dolly had covered, including ""Save The Last Dance For me"", ""Downtown"", ""I Walk The Line"", ""Elusive Butterfly"", ""Turn Turn Turn"", ""She Don't Love You"", ""We Had It All"", ""We'll Sing In The Sunshine"", ""I Can't Help Myself"" and ""Great Pretender"". I think this is worth owning for these songs as she offers a unique take on them. While it doesn't measure to her 1996 covers album TREASURES, its still a solid effort. The bonus tracks include covers of ""Harper Valley PTA"" and ""Divorce"", as well as her past hits ""I Will Always Love You"", ""Here You Come Again"", ""Jolene"", and ""9 to 5"". Overall this is the CD to get if you've been looking for her 1984 album THE GREAT PRETENDER, here it is."
5,Behind the White Coat,"Excellent book for doctors and patients who want to understand the medical system and in particular, Behind theWhite Coat is a valuable asset to medical students and ""would-be"" doctors and their families.Patients can learn alot about their own health care and about those to whom they entrust their care. I think you will find it to be worthwhile reading and very timely in today's world."
2,received damaged,i received this in a padded vanilla envelope and the box shown in the picture was flattened and the first time i went to use the product twords the bottom of the tube where it had been fold blew out and sprayed steel all over
5,"I didn't realize I had a soul, until it was touched....","You may think it an over statement, but I truly loved everything about this album. I got lost in the soft melodies and classical styling. The imagery often pushed me off to daydreaming of the settings that the lyrics had unfolded. I forgot all the silly idiosyncrasies of pop culture and could only think of all things ideal. Some say that certain musical compositions can enlist an altered state of consciousness in some of the listeners, without any real formula for this event. Well, I was all there. I got drunk on the feeling, of a lack of feeling. It is auditory relaxation."
5,"Incredible Music, Incredible Voice!!!!","Enya is the most amazing Celtic songstress, I have ever heard. From her 1st album to her latest CD, I am always humbled by her ability to make me forget everything else and just immerse myself in her voice and the sounds that accompany it. She can make any bad mood lift and any hard moment disappear. I can listen to her on a rainy day or a sunny day, no matter what else is going on around you, her angelic sounds are appropriate. I cannot compare her talent to very many other artists. This lady is a ""DIVA"" in her own right, along with Celine Dion, and the other true talents, we have all come to know and love. Don't let the opportunity to have this one in your collection, pass you by. If you own it, play it often. If you don't own it, buy it now and keep it in your player, after you first listening, you will be ""hooked"" on Enya....ENJOY!!!!"
4,Where's the rest of the album!?!,"I agree with the reviewer who said this album is way too short. I just bought it recently, and I like almost every track. But I find myself drawn into a song, just for it to end way too quickly. Even if she did not have more songs to put on here, at least lengthen the songs. With another minute or two added to each song, it would not have gone stale. I find that there are various different sounds on this album, so having such short tracks makes it sound cut up, rather than flowing smoothly like her other cds (I didn't even realize those are all only about 40 min). When I listen to the cd, I keep imagining they're samples and I'll be able to buy the actual songs later...and then I realize these ARE the actuals songs. Even cds from the 70's are not this short. 35 min is about half an album these days.Oh well...it's still a great cd that's definitely worth owning. Its only crime is that it keeps you begging for more."
4,"Think ""Misty""","but without the cigarette smoke... Haunting and tearful at times, joyous the next. Not necessarily her best, but almost."
2,What's the big deal.....,"I was really expecting something extra ordinary and instead was confronted with watered down Vangelis/Clanaad. Yeah, the keyboards provide a decent texture and the vocals have that dreamy quality. I think other artists have done a better job."
4,My First ENYA Purchase,"I am mainly a fan of Country Western music, but have other tastes as well. I found myself drawn to the songs ""A Day Without Rain"" and ""Only Time"" when hearing them on television. I just HAD to see if I could locate the Artist. I read a few of the reviews and I'm VERY happy with this CD. It is a wonderful collection which I would describe as a perfect companion to a relaxing candlelit evening. Share it with someone you love."
2,Way Way too Short!! Very Disappionted,"I have always like Enya and was excited to get this album when I heard the ""only time"" song. But when I played it despite some lovely songs, it was so short! Really I have to say not my money's worth. I think it is only 38 minutes or so, just enough time to get into the mood and then it stops on YOU! I think it is much more worthwhile to listen to her other albums. Enya, I know you have more songs in there! Add a few more next time. I dont even usally write reviews, so this had to really bother me to get on the computer and do so!"
3,"Four Stars for the Music, One Star for value","First off, in my mind it is unconscionable to place a mere 35 minutes of music on a medium that will hold twice that, and still charge full price. In addition, there is no information such as track times that would alert the consumer to the abbreviated length of the cd. That is the reason I give the recording three stars. If the music were not so enjoyable, I would have rated it two or less.If you enjoy Enya's music, you will enjoy this recording. The harmonics are lush, the melodies are beautiful in their simplicity, and the lyrics have a kind of spiritual quality. The flow of the selections is perhaps the most cohesive of any of her previous offerings.If you do not like Enya's music, it is doubtful this cd will change your mind."
5,I think she came back great,"I don't see why everyone is saying they're so disappointed with this new album. I'm actually very pleased. I was afraid that after so long her songs would just be boring, but I was wrong. Unfortunately, ""A Day Without Rain"" was utterly dull and boring. I couldn't even listen to the whole thing. But I absolutely love ""Wild Child"" and ""Lazy Days"". They're so playful and dreamlike. ""Flora's Secret"" was cheerful and pretty, it just made me think of a garden in bloom. I really enjoyed ""One by One"", especially the ""Don't say, Adios say, Adios..."" You'll just have to listen to it. This album kind of has the same theme throughout but it's really good. ""Silver Inches"" made me think of inches that were made out of silver. I'm serious! And ""Tempus Vernum"" has that cool dark, moody tone, similar to that of ""Pax Deorum"" on ""The Memory of Trees"". If you're new to Enya's music, I would reccommend you get ""Sheperd Moons"" or ""Watermark"" first, then get this one."
4,The saga continues....,"Pop in any Enya CD, and you're pretty certain what you are going to get. In reality, looking back at Enya's past releases, it seems that every release is the next chapter in the same book rather than brand new material. This isn't really a bad thing. Fans of previous releases will get more of what they expect, only this time the songs seem to be far more upbeat than before. This album really breaks no new ground and is noticeably too short for the first release in five years, but those who have enjoyed what has come before will want to settle in for an undoubtably enjoyable ride."
4,brief magic,"The music on this CD is magical, flowing from track to track in ethereal fashion, without even a hint of synthesized fluff. The sound is more mature, more refined than Watermark, which is still quite good. But suddenly, unexpectedly, the flow is haulted -- silence at only 34:28, leaving the listener wanting more. Sure, all things must end, but in this case the end is a bit too soon."
5,Very good effort,"I've read some criticism here about this CD that it's too much like some of Enya's older work. I don't know about that because this is the first CD of hers that I bought. All I know is that there are a whole lot of really cool songs in it, such as ""Wild Child"", ""Only Time"", ""Flora's Secret"" and ""One by One"". The CD grows on you if you give it time."
3,cheesy,"Enya has a blow-you-away voice and I really think the direction (electronic) she is going with her music could be powerfully moving- if she could find the right producer and keep her lyrics from sounding like a self-help motivational guide. This is just too cheesy, like a Massingill commercial- trying way too hard to acheive that summer fresh feeling. If you want to feel uplifted by Enya, stick to her older stuff."
5,Soul-food,"After the tragic events of Spetmeber 11th, the best comfort is to curl up with a great CD -- and this fits the bill. ""Only Time"" and ""Lazy Days"" are enough to get your mind off your problems if only for a little bit. I highly recommend this to anyone."
5,SWEET WAY TO DESCRIBE LIFE,"Only Time is just an anthem, related to life. Maybe the best way to describe this CD is that this CD is the best Enya prodct, because it was made with her heart. Sweet November is the movie related to this CD. Touchable movie where the song Only Time, the best in the Enya career has a real meaning, too human meaning to be honest."
3,"Beautiful music, but no new ground","When I heard that Enya was about to release a new CD, I was ecstatic. ""The Memory of Trees"" came out five years ago, and it was about time for some new stuff. The CD is lovely (as usual) featuring Enya's lush, layered vocals and multilingual songs. However, after listening to the tracks several times, some seemed interchangeable. Each track relies heavily on plucked strings, so the music feels static. Roma Ryan also needs to find some new material to inspire her lyrics. That having been said, the giddy innocence of ""Wild Child"" and the darker overtones of ""Tempus Vernum"" do show some innovation that will hopefully inspire future albums."
3,Enya paints by numbers and comes up short,"Why is it that Enya never seems to come close to her remarkable breakthrough 1988 release, ""Watermark""? She certainly had it in mind when she made this album, as the opening title track is clearly modeled after ""Watermark""'s. But it comes nowhere near matching it, nor does this disc. Enya and the Ryans seem to be playing it safe with this offering, compared to the varied and dizzyingly beautiful songs of ""Watermark"". And at less than 35 minutes (even shorter than her debut album), that clinches a disppointing 3-stars for it, compared with ""Watermark""'s five stars and four-stars for her self-titled debut (retitled ""The Celts""), ""Shepherd Moons"" and ""The Memory of Trees"". Make no mistake: Even at her weakest, Enya remains beautiful to hear, but I listened to this one after playing ""Watermark"", and that's like following up a gourmet dinner with vanilla ice cream."
3,rehash,"i'm sorry i liked enyas albums. but she is really is beginning to sound devoid of new ideas. everything on this cd is ""same ol same ol"". this sounds so stale and lifeless.she is just going thru the motions.give me watermark anyday"
3,Vampira's Enya - A Day Without Rain Review,"Well, theres afew things to say about this album. Its a great album to sit down and listen to when you just want to relax and unwind, however, it tires out quickly. You will love it and listen to it religiously for a month or two and then youll never want to hear it again. I still listen to it ocasionally when i want to relax but other then that i dont listen to it anymore. i think this album is more worth downloading or getting a burned copy then buying it but i definetly reccomend listening through it at least once. The songs dont seem that good when you first listen to them, but they grow on you eventually."
3,Why so short?,"I love Enya, she's one of my favorite artist. I have all of her CD's, including this one. I love this album, but it's too short; it's not even 35 minutes long. Plus there's only 11 tracks. Plus, most of the songs on here are short, barely 3 minutes long. Don't get me wrong, I love Enya, I also like every song on this album, I'm just disappointed at the length of it; she could have put a few more tracks on here. I'd buy an Enya album any day, short or long. I can listen to her all day...I can't wait until her next one."
4,Quality Over Quantity,"Many of the reviews I've read here have complained about the CD's 34 minute length. I would counter that the quality of the material here more than makes up for it. There is no filler, all the tracks are good. This is my favorite Enya CD since ""Watermark"". It's gorgeous."
3,This CD is like a re-run,"I really love Enya and I am a huge fan, but this album was somewhat of a disappointment. There is one song that sounds purely original, but beyond that, it is a patchwork quilt with little snippets of all of her other albums sewn in. Now, if you're not familiar with any of Enya's other work, this would be a great introduction for you, but for the devoted fan, the unoriginality is plainly obvious."
5,Like Vintage Wine,"Yes 5 years is a long time, but good effort takes time. This is clearly real adult fun. The music is best enjoyed while sipping a white wine and staring into a medow. Many of us live tense lives and Enya helps take the edge off. My only question is this: If you went to an Enya concert wouldn't it spoil the mood to applaud?"
3,gooollllldfingeerrrr!,I think its an ok cd...Gotta love that title song. Cannot resist singing along.
5,Rap at its best,M.C. Hammers songs complete with all the hits included.Totally awesome youll love it. Try his other CDS to its even better
5,Turn this Mutha Out!,The CD arrived at my house very quickly. I needed some ol skool music for a party and I put in the CD and everyone got up and was dancing....the party was off the chain! Thanks in part to my CD ordered through amazon.com. I would definately order again.
1,wow!,"This is the man that revolutionized that great wonderful genre that everyone seems to like and admire rap is the only true form of musical art forget stupid death,black,thrash,power,grindcore,progressive,viking crap that has no originality and unintelligent lyrics.anyways this is a must have for any fan of hip hop or rap the best music in the world MC Hammer is god you can't touch diz!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,meow,"This book is...okay, it's not something thats grand or something that should be considered a cult comic. I mean there are stories in this comic that do absorb you and you feel for the chracter, but most of his stories are pretty much along the same lines, and after a while it gets sort of repeptive, if you're someone who is a hopeless romantic and starting to get into comics, then these comics that are for you, but if you're a teenager or a college student or whatever that is hateful and angsty, then, no, maybe you should read Daniel Clowes, or Nate Powell."
2,DOSTOYEVSKY - ALWAYS A GOOD READ,"WE HAVE NOT YET FINISHED READING THE BOOK BECAUSE WE WERE LOOKING FOR LARGE PRINT BOOKS AND AMONG THE SUPPOSEDLY LARGE PRINT THIS ONE WAS LISTED. WE WERE DISAPPOINTED WHEN WE GOT IT BUT WE KEPT IT. WE ARE NOW READING IT BUT SLOWLY AS IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO READ REGULAR SIZE PRINTED BOOKS. WE ARE ENJOYING WHAT WE HAVE READ SO FAR, DOSTOYEVSKY IS ALWAYS INTERESTING BUT CERTAINLY NOT CHEERFUL READING."
2,Out of date,"This guide is out of date. In my opinion, a much more current, and insightful, insider's view of work life at top companies can be found in the Vault Reports career guides (and individual reports on major employers.)"
2,OK book for basic info but don't expect too much,OK but don't expect to be able to SAFELY adjust your horse or pony after reading this book only.
4,Celtic evangelism takes a new twist.,"This Irish Coleen dwelled in the desciptions of her ancestors land, learning much about the Emerald Isle's history and religion from this rapid action,romantic fiction novel. The spirit of Ireland is portrayed captivatingly through the strength of the warrior queen, defending her home, and the captive groom defending his faith. A good cool weather fireside read to warm ye bones."
3,Eh!,"For my weekly movie night, I picked this movie and For Richer or Poorer (Tim Allen, Kirstie Alley). I watched F.R.O.P. first....it's about a disgruntled new york couple, on the verge of divorce, who are forced out of the city and into the country. Next, I watched ""Did you hear about the Morgans?""...it's also about a disgruntled new york couple, on the verge of divorce, who are a forced out of the city and into the country. Needless to say, ""The Morgans"" were stale."
1,Did you hear about the Morgans,It was bad!!! Was is supposed to be a comedy? I did not laugh once. This movie is a waste of time.
3,;0),"Love Hugh Grant but I think sometimes your allowed some crappy films under your belt. This isn't a bad movie it's watchable had a good few laughs but tweak a little more with Hughs comic personality it could be more. Sarah is not bad either, but all in all it's not that bad so I'm half and half on this one."
2,It could have been funny,The pairing of Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker had the potential to be much funnier. This is one of those cases where the trailers are about the only parts of the movie worth watching. I saw it on pay per view and was not impressed.
3,Please! No More Sarah Jessica Parker!,"There's no question that Hugh Grant is one of the best comedic (and serious ) actors of our times and he deserves better scripts! As for pairing him with Sarah Jessica Parker, there was zero chemistry between them. I kept thinking of him with Sandra Bullock and how well paired they were. No chemistry makes a film fail in my opinion. Too many suits involved in the creative process.Mary Sternbergen (Ted Danson's wife) was fantastic, and I hope we see more of her."
3,The Vidiot Reviews...,"Did You Hear About the Morgans?The first thing that you should do after witnessing a murder is contact your plastic surgeon, so that they can alter your face, bleach your skin and surgically elongate your legs. Unfortunately, the separated couple in this rom-com decided to go to the authorities instead.While on a reconciliation date, Paul and Meryl Morgan (Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker) bare witness to a homicide. Forced into witness-protection, they must flee NYC and hideout in Wyoming. Under the protection of local law enforcement (Sam Elliott and Mary Steenburgen), the Morgans must adapt to rural life, which, in turn, helps rekindle their relationship.More a fish-out-of-water tale than a murder mystery, the killer chasing the Morgans is merely there to move along the romantic plot line, which is predictable and pedestrian.Besides, when hiding out from a murderer, it is best to do so in plain sight...while wearing a fatsuit. (Yellow Light)"
2,Hugh Grant should find better material,"This is another deadly dull and unimaginative movie-by-numbers from the same people who brought you a thousand other movies no one remembers three minutes after leaving the cinema. Hugh Grant can't make movies in the UK any more because the British seem to make only about one movie every couple of years. So, to pay for the fuel for his Aston Martin, Grant has to accept scripts that seem to have been written by machines. Everything is totally predictable, the humor - despite stalwart performances by Grant and Sam Elliott - is unfunny, the situations pathetic and the resolution is obvious from the opening voice-over. This is dishwater of the thinnest kind and should be avoided by anyone who wants not to lapse into a catatonic state. On the other hand, if you have trouble sleeping, this could be the cure you've been looking for."
4,A very good set,Very versatile and a must have if you cut curves for any project that you have. I use freehand all the time and was pleasantly surprised by the results.
1,More Re-Done Inferior Versions,"It looks as though exposing the Bill Haley re-makes is becoming a thing with me. Sorry, folks, but this is yet another one among far too many which offer versions of his hits done years after the originals.Not only that, but neither Helena nor Panic could ever be categorized as ""classics"" under any circumstances and by anyone's definition, and the only good version of I've Got News For You is Ray Charles' 1961 hit.Bill Haley is a R&R; legend and legends should never have this kind of junk foisted upon the buying public in the guise of originals, Amazon should offer this as a coffee coaster."
4,Great Little People Toy!,"My 3-year-old granddaughter loves this Little People set-up! It was the only toy she wanted to play with at Christmas. The best thing about it is that it contains all the Little People characters--some sets have only one or two. She knows them all by name and plays ""school"" by the hour--she can also carry some of the characters in her bag to play with away from home. A really cute set!!"
2,Slow to get in to,"I haven't finished the book yet, which is rare for me. I find it to be a little too ""foo foo"" for my tastes, as there's not enough meat. I was looking to be moved, but I didn't get very far."
2,This book absolutely not for beginner,"i don't know to whom this book the author wrote. If you are a beginner, you must be confuse read it but if you are not a beginner again u won't get nothing from this book.There is no tip or trick. Trade for a living far better than this book"
2,Spend your money elsewhere if you want to learn TA,"Over 330 pages w/charts but I didn't care for the fact that so much fluff was added to a dry subject. I want to learn TA. Deep digging is necessary to find how to actually set up the less than complete TA indicators although some interpretation substance is present. The book jumps around on too many markets and doesn't focus on one subset like stocks or bonds or currencies. This book hits them all with little depth on any. That is the main problem I have with this book. Too much clutter for the stock trader. All in all, I had to spend my cash (sans 16.95 for this one) on other books to learn TA. Perhaps this book caters to a more educated audience than my simple college degree and 2 years daily momo trading experience but for the individual looking for a specific market TA guide, wanting specific TA setup and use, this is not the book for you."
3,slight letdown,"I feel like an outcast, but I gotta be honest: I tried to love this album and just didn't. I'm a fan of the old Let's Active albums and was really looking forward to hearing some new Mitch Easter songs. While there are some good ones on this album, there is just nothing that truly lights my fire and makes me think he's getting better with age. No magic. And that's what I was really hoping for. But hey, if you are a fan of Let's Active, I think you still need to get this album and see what Mitch is doing nowadays. Other reviewers obviously like this one a lot, I'm just disappointed that I didn't feel the same way."
2,Struggles with smaller objects,"I bought this to measure two things basically: tennis and baseball velocity. After testing the gun at first just on some cars, I was excited because it was extremely accurate. However, once I went to measure baseball pitching velocity and tennis, it was consistently 15-20 mph slow. The baseball pitcher was throwing in the mid to upper 80s, and has been verified by a JUGS gun, and he was topping out on this gun at 73. I wanted this to work so badly because it is a great price, but I believe I will have to return it because it has not been accurate for me on what I wanted it for."
5,WOOOOOOO,55 MPH DOWNHILL CONFIRMED!I use this to clock my friends longboarding all the time and it's fantastic!
4,Good for Little League,"I read many of the reviews and didn't know what to expect at first. After using it according to the directions (yes, you still have to read them after all these years), I found that this product is good for Little League and Pony League baseball (46 to 52 feet), but you have to be close enough to the pitcher for it to work well (within 75 feet), and be directly in line with the pitch to limit the angle and get a more accurate reading. I tested this instrument with a pitching machine of known velocities from 46 feet, and found it to be pretty accurate. However, if you're planning on using it to measure velocities on a regulation diamond, get a more expensive and more sensitive gun.Mad DogHampden, MA"
3,Size Chart Wrong,"I love the design and materials used for the jacket, but the sizing is all wrong.I have 2 yorkshire terriors and I ordered them each a life jacket. The small which is for the older dog arrived today.My older dog weighs 7lbs.The small is supposed to be for dogs 7-10lbs, but it is too big around the neck and his front feet get tangled in the part that secures around the neck.The XS is supposed to be for dogs 6lbs and under. I ordered the XS for my younger dog who is 5lbs. It hasnt arrived yet. I hope it fits her. I also plan to try it on the older dog as well. If it fits him better I will return the small and order another XS for him.If XS is too small, I have found that I can use the small by simply attaching the neck part up behind his head. It gives him a little less stability in the water, but at least his feet don't get stuck and he stays afloat!"
4,learning about derby glasses,a freind showed me this book to study on derby glasses as this book is what he uses he lives in ky and has all the glasses alot of multibles very informative
3,A good but preachy story,"This was my introduction to Dennis Lehane, and I will definitely be reading more of his work. This was a solid effort but it fell short in some aspects. For one thing, Lehane's characters are interesting but not particularly endearing. I personally didn't feel the chemistry between Patrick and Angie.The exploration of the relations between the various races, classes and cultures in Boston is particularly revealing. But I found Lehane to be a bit too preachy and his characters prattle on far too long about which race is to be blamed for what. I don't think it's too authentic that almost every conversation degenerates into an angry exchange of philosophies on social problems.This book may have been billed as suspense and mystery and but it also seems to double as a platform for Lehane to expound on his opinions about racial issues. Hopefully in the follow up books he'll be heavier on the storyline and lighter on the preaching."
5,A toast to Mr. Lehane!!!,"Dennis Lehane's ""A Drink Before the War"" is nothing short of fantastic. Not only is Mr. Lehane an excellent writer, but also an excellent storyteller. His descriptions of both Boston and the struggles of those who live within are so accurate that the reader feels that he or she is actually a witness in the story.This is the first Dennis Lehane book that I have had the pleasure of reading, and I look forward to reading many more.J.R. Reardonauthor, ""Confidential Communications"""
3,Entertaining,"At the outset, the author is not afraid to use language largely avoided today because of political correctness -- bravo to him. Additionally, it's a nice trip down memory lane. It is quite fun to run around Boston with the characters, but when it comes to the outlying Massachusetts towns, the author finds it necessary to create fictional place names -- why? I also found this to be the case with William Martin and it drives me insane. The central character, Patrick Kenzie, can be self-important and vain-glorious and, at times, unrealistic. Whereas, real crimes do occasionally take place on the Boston Common, one doesn't see people shooting up the place with an Uzi, nor does one witness a real life detective blowing people away just because he doesn't agree with the individual's criminal mentality. William Tapply wrote a host of Brady Coyne novels set in Boston that are a tinge more in line with reality, if one is interested. Nonetheless, it is an entertaining read."
4,A Superb Story,"A first I thought I was reading a cheap imitation of Robert Parker. Thankfully, this did not turn out to be the case. It was an exceptional first novel, with interesting and fully developed characters. I particularly liked the male-female detective duo. It was a little choppy at first, and some of the jokes seem forced, but Lehane eventually makes it work. It isn't as funny as Parker and the dialogue isn't as sharp, but the story is superb and the race element adds a compelling dimension. A very promising debut and I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series. A couple more strong efforts like this and he may crack my top 5 mystery authors (Block, Burke, Connelly, Parker and Saylor)."
1,"NOPE, NOPE---DIDN'T LIKE IT","There were some things wrong with this book. First, did the authorwrite this while standing at a pulpit??? One sermon after another afteranother. The whole KENSIE / GENNARO thing got tiring. And the dialogue was?? supposed ?? to be witty / funny, , , it was not !!Might be, , , the author was trying for a SPENSER kinda thing, , ,it didn't work."
5,Grace Based Parenting,"Amazing. I have read a number of parenting books and this one is by far the most helpful, the most hopeful. I have already shared my amazement of this book with my friends and also with other new moms and moms groups. How would anyone parent without this grace based perspective? This book has caused me to reflect on my own childhood as well as clarify the way I would like to raise our children. Kids are all different and we cannot parent them on a basis of fear. I am very grateful for Dr. Tim Kimmel and his willingness to share this hopeful and helpful perspective on parenting. If you are a parent or have ever been a parent, this is a must read."
3,"Good in general, but a little disappointing at the end","Overall I felt this was a great book. The author made some great points about Christian parenting and tied it into key biblical passages. He was very general, though. If you're new to grace-based parenting, and don't have any role models to turn to, you might be left asking what's next? How do you really implement grace-based discipline? I felt I needed more specifics. But where I was truly disappointed was at the very end when the author condoned spanking. I honestly don't see how you can hit a small child in grace."
4,Like it so far,"I haven't finished reading the whole book, but I like what I have read so far. This is not one of those books that tells you how to deal with misbehaviors like I thought it would be, but it is a great book."
4,"Yes, you should buy it!","I first saw Biblezines back in 2005 and was curious about them but for some reason never took the plunge. Recently I was looking for something fun to re-energize my desire to spend time reading the bible and I remembered Biblezines. It was so worth it! They are inexpensive and really fun. Since it looks like a regular magazine I feel really comfortable tucking it into my purse and taking it to work with me (...I don't mind bringing my regular bible, but the Biblezine has the plus of a totally casual/cool persona!). I am in my early/mid 30s and I bought the original ""becoming"" version. It seems to fit my life stage well, but I'm sure it would have in my early 20s, too-- the fun little extras are about being a woman, not a ""mommy"". I would encourage you to buy it for yourself or give as a gift-- I love mine!"
2,Just a little too graphic for me,"I fall in the category of those turned off by the vivid descriptions of death, torture and cruelty to animals. When Mr. Smith wants to, the story could be extremely interesting. His description of a sandstorm was magnificent. His descriptions of different forms of death and violence are also magnificent, but just a big turnoff for me. A particularly gruesome chapter was the one about ""running the red road"". I can only assume that the ""red road"" is named for the amount of blood spilled along the way. I found that the only way I could finish the book was to skip all the parts where he started describing war strategy and skimming the really bloody parts."
2,Uninspiring,What happened to the magic of River God and the suspense and intrigue of The Seventh Scroll? Reading this book was like watching paint dry. Wilbur's heart and passion in not to be found in his latest book.
5,Didn't want it to end!,"Could hardly put this book down, as with all others. Love the ones about ancient Egypt."
5,Avani IS the Real Thing!,Avani is a real artist. Great vocals and good songs. You can't help but wonder why she isn't better known.
4,Contra Darwin,"I was sentenced to state indoctrination in the Michigan Public School System from 1956 through 1967 and NEVER encountered the ideas put forth by Kropotkin. In fact, it was the references to Kropotkin in ""The Probability Broach"" that inspired me to look up ""Mutual Aid"". This book gives the other side of life on Earth - the side Darwin ignored - the side that governments ignore. If your life is dedicated to competition, you may wish to ignore this book, also, and its discussion of the limitations of the competitive paradigm. This is one of those books that lapdog academia wants ignored - a book that throws the entire concept of politics into question. Read it and grow."
3,Nobody has mentioned the music!,"I first saw the film version of ""Our Town"" on television when I was a child. Something about it appealed to me; perhaps a desire to return to an idealized time. In high school, I read the play and was devistated by Emily's death, which was changed in the film, giving it a happy ending. Throughout the years and varias versions that I've seen , I have never been able to figure out what it exactly is , that the dead people were preparing FOR in the cemetary. But, my reason for writing this is because of the one thing that is never mentioned in any of these reviews : the beautiful musical score by Aaron Copeland. I'm am over 50 years old and just listening to Mr. Copeland's score starts my tears flowing. It is truely exquisite! I count myself lucky to have had the oppertunity of meeting him briefly in 1972, and meeting Martha Scott app. 10 years later."
2,Run Away!!!,"Our Town is an underrated classic, and I would recomend it to anyone. However, this is without a doubt the worst DVD transfer I've ever seen. To be honest, I'm not sure I've ever seen a truly clean copy of this movie, but I've seen better than this. The audio is the main problem here, as much of the dialogue is indecipherable. I can't believe anyone would have the nerve to release a film in this condition...it's an outrage."
5,This Is The Best one,"This is The Best One among the eight Roy D. Mercer CD's I have purchased, extremely entertaining, I highly recommend it."
1,POOR PRODUCT,"PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT NOVEMBER 06. BY DECEMBER 06 IT STOPPED WORKING. RETURNED TO MANUFACTURER AT MY EXPENSE FOR REPAIR WHICH TOOK FOUR WEEKS. UPON RECEIPT IT WORKED ANOTHER TWO WEEKS. MANUFACTURER REFUSED TO REFUND MY MONEY, SAID NOT THEIR POLICY, AND TO RETURN IT AGAIN FOR A NEW UNIT. IT HAS NOW BEEN ANOTHER EIGHT WEEKS SINCE THE RETURN AND STILL NO REFRIGERATOR. CHAMBRER DOESN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT CUSTOMER RELATIONS. NOW DOESN'T EVEN RESPOND TO MY E-MAILS. THIS THING HAS COST ME $230.00 (THE PURCHASE PLUS SHIPPING OF 25.00 BOTH TIMES) NOT WORTH THE AGGREVATION. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SHOP FOR A DIFFERENT MANUFACTURER"
4,Quiet power,"I use this to supply power for my 27 foot travel trailer. Although it will not power all the electrical items in my unit at the same time, it does work very well if I manage them properly. The air conditioner is the most important item and it seems to work well with this. The noise level is excellent. At my last campout, several people wanted to get the information because it was so quiet."
4,Simply Breathtaking,For anyone living in England i would suggest like me that they catch on to David Bisbal's music. Its got a smooth flow of ballads with the energetic beats in the album. This is certainly one album which has a diverse blend of different melodies and rhythms that i havnt heard since i brought a Ricky Martin album. I admit im not fluent in Spanish but this is an album that speaks Internationally itself. I recommend that David Bisbal bring out an English album soon!
4,"More mature, more ""Spanish""","This CD shows a more mature Bisbal. The melodies are less ""latin"" and ""dance"" but more ""flamenco"", faithful to David's Spanish roots. Athough maybe not as refreshing and surprising as his previous CD, this one will for sure please his current fans and get more people interested on his work."
5,BUY THIS CD,"David Bisbal ist meiner Meinung nach der Beste Sänger der Welt! Er singt Live und auch in Studioversion echt einfach GENIAL! Seine neue CD Buleria ist wie auch die erste(Coranzon Latino) sehr schön. Hier zeigt er wiedermal seinen eigenen Stil. Wer sich diese CD nicht kauft,verpasst was!Die CD ist außerdem nach der ersten Woche schon 400.000 mal allein in Spanien verkauft worden!Ich hoffe und glaube er wird auch wie z.B. Ricky Martin International sehr Berühmt!"
1,I want my $1.99 back!,"This movie is terrible. A big hint is the overly long monologue at the start, which I found hard to follow. The acting is terrible, so bad that I thought that I, with not 1 minute of acting experience, could have done a better job. The action and plot is so stupid, I could not even watch it all the way through. Avoid this, it is definitely not worth the rental price."
2,Nearing expiration,"I really expected to like these from the description and ingredients, but it turns out that they're not all that great. They're too sweet (and I'm the kind of person who usually likes sweet trail mix) and the peanut-butter candies have a strange taste. Also, they were only about a month away from the expiration date when I received them. Overall, very disappointing."
1,Lemonade anyone?,"This unit just died on me within three months. The charger works (I bought it separately) but I cannot hotsync anymore - what's the point of having a iPAQ that does not sync? It's either the connector to the cradle or the connector to the base of the handheld that's not connecting. For the high $$$ that I had to pay for this flimsy product, it's really a pity that HP will not provide a good product. It's poor design makes the iPAQ rock back and forth without a firm connection."
5,Why Havent you gotten this book yet?,"1)All of us are guilty of being in a trans-like state while watching the TV! I have been TV free for almost 2 years! Thanks to this book.I recommend this book before you read Neil Postman. this book gives wonderful examples of TV-minds, and how we are possesed and live our lives around a small (or big) black box that controls our minds! My advice, read this book, get more knowledge on the effects of TV in your life then THROW THE TV IN THE GARBAGE!"
4,Excellent Overview of Television's Inherent Biases,"This book, along with ""Amusing Ourselves To Death"" by Neil Postman, is a must read for anyone who wants to understand theinherent biases of the medium of television. The author's background in the advertising industry and as an enviromental activist have given him valuable insight into why the medium isuseful in promoting the values of its corporate controllers butnot the alternative values of ecology or the world view of NativeAmerican Cultures. There are a few needless digressions on thepotential health effects of artificial light but for the most part the reader will profit from the author's analysis. I wasleft with one question. To what degree can the same criticismbe applied to either radio or film?"
3,Outstanding music ... but ...,"This CD was a bit of a disappointment. Robert Palmer had a pure voice and was an important part of the 80s music ""revolution,"" and his contributions to the music world are sadly missed. But had I known this CD was ""digitally re-mastered"" I would not have purchased it. We don't need his music updated. I want to hear it just as it played on the radio over the years.CDs such as this need to carry a ""re-mastered"" disclaimer. I've purchased far too many classic CDs only to discover time has changed the music, and it's not always for the best."
3,"Remixes are tacky, Palmer was not.",I bought this CD on a whim after hearing a couple of old Robert Palmer hits. The remixes ruin what should be a fine summation of his life's work. Robert Palmer had style this collection does not.
3,good CD but...,"This is a good CD full of Robert Palmers greatest hits. I enjoyed very much hearing them once again. The one big problem with this CD is that many of these songs are not the original releases. They are instead remix's, which do not live up to the original. I could tell instantly they were not the original versions. So yes its full of great Robert Palmer songs but I expected the original releases not remix's, so, as the old saying goes "" Buyer Beware"""
2,Too many remixes,"I bought this CD for the older tracks such as Johnny and Mary and Clues not the newer tired hits.To my disapointment, it sounds as if these tracks and others have been remixed. Some sort of notice should be given whenever a track is not the orignal."
1,Horrible,Worst movie ive ever seen. The acting was so bad it makes u actually hate life for a bit its SOOOOO BAD!! HORRIBLE JOB GUYS. PLEASE DONT MAKE ANYMKRE MOVIES!
2,Yooo,THis movie wasnt bad coustume didnt look real but i actually liked the movie ... U should before buying not worth the price
3,This is a slightly better than average sasquatch film..,"Some interesting kills, fun scenes and some funny comedy. It's better than more than half the sasquatch movies out there. What made this movie worth watching is the George Carlin Wanna-Be who plays the illegal big game poacher. The heavy set nerd turns red every time he moves or talks... That is funny to see within itself. Plus the video at the end makes no sense because it isn't the video of the sasquatch the two nerds captured. In the film, they catch the sasquatch on film by a window, but when you see the footage at the end, he is by a dumpster. Trust me, that is not a spoiler... Really has nothing to do with the film, other than it's a blaring mistake. I recommend this film to any Big Foot fan, but to anyone else, I recommend to stay away. It gets 3 out of 5 stars as far as sasquatch films are concerned."
1,NOT DUCK TAPE,"When I ordered this, I was told it was duct tape, NOT. It is like electrical tape. Not going by your recommendations anymore."
5,One in a decade,"Leftism is one of those works that are a real landmark in popular music history, the creativity, the oneness, the sound, the absolute ""outstanding inspiration"" (may I say this? :) make this CD one you couldn't afford to miss! Get it, it will be one of yours ""all times faves"". One of the best buys you will ever make..John Lydon's performance is GREAT.. joaquim-milan-italy"
1,A Big No-No!,"I reccomended this movie to help my younger sisters stop fighting. It didn't help because it showed two cousins named Vanessa and Shaina who were fighting in the first episode and the girls thought they were role-models. Vanessa kept saying that Shaina was copying her when she really wasn't. Anyway, the girls tried to divide the room to show each other which side of the room belonged to who. In like just a half hour later, Vanessa packs all her toys and favorite things and moves to the garage. The second episode about Binyah Binyah's parade was not a problem. I don't know what happened then, but I still do not reccomend this video to kids who are three up to the end of kindergarten. We watched this movie up until the ages of nine, eight, and seven years old and then we got rid of it, thank goodness!"
4,Excellent Battery for Mini Cooper S,"Fits nicely in my 2004 Mini Cooper S. Only thing to look out for is you need to manually spread the clamp for the positive terminal. Will not slide on without doing so. And of course bend the extra wire up and out of the way as the terminal is farther in on the battery than it is on the stock oem battery but that information I found all over the net. I have only had it in for a couple weeks so I cannot speak to its longevity. Does seem to turn the car over a little easier/quicker, but I could be imagining that."
2,Two out of Two failed-,"I bought two of these batteries and both failed after two years. Amazon won't take it back and Optima will mess with you until you give up. They aren't cheap either.EDIT 3/4/11 Optima finally sent me a new battery and told me to dispose of the old one so even though I don't like the batteries, they do honor their warranty.I called Optima direct for this."
5,Dittos from a grandmother,"I just read all of the currently posted reviews and will just say dittos to all! I met PHS at my daughter's home when she was a beginning home schooling mom about 1990 or so. I have been subscribing ever since just to keep informed and because I thoroughly enjoy its appearance in the mail and then reading most of every issue. It also just gives me a plain old good, warm, feeling about what is going on with the families and young people who are coming up to be the next adult generation.I taught in a pretty good public school system for 25 years and our 5 children attended Lutheran elementary and high schools, but if I could do it over I would love the joy and privilege of teaching them myself with PHS to help and encourage along the way."
4,How Can a Book be Sad but a Good Read?,"This book was sooo sad!! I was in shock at how this crazy family even functioned. I read this book in one day!! What a good picture of what has happened and continues to happen in what people think are ""normal"" famlies. What a brave girl the main character turned out to be. You will have this story on your mind for awhile after you read it. Great job Kimberly Matthews!!"
2,Avoid this unless your a big batman fan.,"Rucka has trouble adapting the epic No Man's Land down to novel length. If he'd written a colosal book in the style of David Wingrove's Chung Kuo with numerous story threads it might have worked better. Instead he focuses almost solely on Batman and the story is reduced substantially. Why does Rucka emphasize Batman's realization that he can't save Gotham alone when the fellow heros that he calls upon for help seem to do almost nothing. Also Rucka actually adds a number of new ideas which are less interesting than the ideas he had to eliminate from the comics to shorten the book. Rucka had a difficult task here: condensing a comic crossover that was made up of almost 100 comic books down to a single volume, so I don't fault him for not living up to the challenge, but this book is for die hard Batman fans only. And if you've already read the comics I wouldn't waste time on this book."
5,it was the BEST!!!!,"I think this was the best cd i have herd in a while, and i can't wait tell the new cd is out!!! as Always, KTBSPA 4-eva!!!!! peace"
1,No mouse doll.,"The product details said this mini book came with a small plush mouse, it does not. But the book is a favorite from our childhood, so the mini book & cd are a nice addition to our daughters collection."
4,Great Book,We love these books! We started out with If You Give A Party and that quickly became my son's favorite book. This book is just as cute. A great little story that's easy to memorize and add your own little additions too. Highly recommend this book
2,"Good Book, But get the full size one",I love this series of books and so do my kids (2 & 4 yo). Unfortunately I didn't read the product description very well because I didn't know it was a mini-book. The book is so small I can barely read the words myself and we have no use for the CD. So I'd really recommend the story but get the full size version of the book.
4,"Not his best, but still better than the rest!","Hard-core Hiatt fans seem to consider this disk something of a throwaway - not getting near the emotional depth of Bring the Family or Walk On. This disk is fun, mostly upbeat, and showcases, once again, the remarkable raw talent of John Hiatt. (Several of the cuts, too, seemed to foreshadow our President's problems - Little Head and Sure Pinocchio). This guy has matured through his music and only seems to get better. He's as clever with the phrase as Elvis Costello and can really touch your heart like Van Morrison. Stand-out cuts include Woman Sawed in Half, Runaway, and Pirate Radio (a real sing-along, if there ever was one). Buy this - but don't make it your only Hiatt!"
1,Disappointed,"Marinated chicken with this and was very disappointed with the flavor! To describe with one word-BLAND! I first let my son taste it, and the look on his face said it all. Thinking maybe he was just being picky I then tried it myself and the result was me throwing it and the chicken both out. Maybe Mrs. Dash's other flavors are better but this one left much to be desired!"
1,Amateur hour...........,"I purchased this dvd based on its comparison to The Unbearable Lightness of Being. What a joke. This film has absolutely nothing in common with The Unbearable Lightness of Being - none of its depth, complexity, or beauty - and certainly none of its acting skill or production value. Now & Later looks and feels like a student film from a local community college. The philosophical points it tries to make are obvious and shallow, the lighting and blocking is awful, and the main characters are poorly developed and even more poorly portrayed by the actors in the film, who have no chemistry at all. Don't believe the hype. Avoid."
1,not very good,"Not the least bit what I expected, very dull and disappointing, I threw the three out that I ordered, would not order this again"
5,Two thumbs way up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I can write a 10 page review for this film, but I won't because I have a life. This is a dark psychosexual drama. If you enjoy dark psych dramas this one is a must. What a treat!!!!"
1,Don't waste your money.,"The quality on this product is very very poor. The nail polish washes off with water, and does not go on smoothly. It is not real polish. The glitter dome doesn't work. The glitter must be in EXACTLY the right place, and the fan doesn't blow it around. We ended up applying the glitter by hand, which worked OK. The product itself is made of very cheap plastic.For the price, you would be MUCH better off putting together your own nail spa kit for your children. The products would all be higher quality, and you would spend less.I have returned this product. It is no fun for my 7 year old to spend a lot of time on her nails, only to have the polish wash off as soon as she touches water."
3,This one fits M8000 and other remote solenoid winches,"For whatever reason the WARN covers are all mixed up. After ordering one that was supposed to fit the M8000, I found it was mismatched with this model. Even WARNs website has it listed incorrectly in a couple places(or at least did). Anyway, this is short/wide to fit winches with a remote solenoid. Mine is mounted under the hood, so this works for me.The best approach to finding the right cover is to go to WARNs site and get the actual diagrams of the covers (dimension included). Their descriptions under the product area don't seem to match up.The cover works fine to keep the sun/rain/snow off my synthetic line. I'm giving a 3 rating because it is WAY overpriced for what it is."
5,Good for an entry and quick start to SQL,"As English is my second language, I found this book very concise and easy to read. Though it is not a complete SQL guide, it do cover the most practical and fundamental parts of SQL. It is a small and thin book. It starts by a list of standard questions and walk you through the corresponding SQL expressions and explanations in only 119 pages. After reading this book, I found myself become more comprehensive and faster to read other complete SQL handbooks. I think this book is an effcient and effective SQL entrance and a fine teaching reference as well."
1,The Most Painful Experience,"I don't understand WHO is giving this movie good reviews. It is terrible. I usually like movies where nothing much happens (The Age of Innocence, Lost in Translation) but this is a joke. There is NO script here. It's just made up of VERY SLOW scenes most of which only involve 2 sentences and finish with the words ""Alright"". Natalie and Robert are supposed to be having a passionate affair, but the two leads look like uncomfortable strangers throught the entire thing.There is little plot and NO emotion from any of the characters. The acting is a joke. The cinemtography etc is bad...but that's not really such a big deal...I'm sure they had budget restraints etc...but seriously...they could have come up with a plot or nice dialogue...or something.This is a like a Pinter-nightmare."
1,Laughably Bad ... Would you like dinner?,"The bad news is this is a bad movie.The good news is it's so bad it's funny.Natalie Wood does a fine job, but Robert Wagner is stiff as a board from beginning to end. It's a surprise she doesn't get splinters from touching him.The plot, such as it is, has some confusing jumps. At one point they may break up, then the next scene shows him moving in with her. The one consistency is that Robert Wagner is always on the lookout for a meal."
1,Boring -- An overblown magazine article,"There's just about enough information in this slim volume to fill out an article in Honcho. And that's the level of writing that the author aims for. You learn precious little about why a middle class ""nerd"" from Mass. became a porno star; the author pads the book out with endless (porno) plot summaries of Parker's films. The fascination of gay men with male porno stars IS intruiging; it could yeild a sexy, insightful, even controversial book. But it would probably take Edmund White or Gary Indiana to write it. This pre-fab job, not even as good as the author's previous book on Cal Culver, commits the worst sin of all: it is BORING. I've been burnt twice by Edmonson, and won't be buying ""The Life and Times of Jack Wranger,"" or whoever's carcass he decides to nibble on next time. One good thing: a great cover. It's just the insides that disappoint."
2,Not sexy or interesting at all,"What was so baffling about this biography of the biggest gay male porno actor of the pre and post-AIDS era was the fact that there weren't very interesting things to be said other than that Drew Okun was a gay porn star.The graphic portions are gratuitous by their nature, and the author didn't generate a great interest in his subject. I was struck by how mundane the star and the writing were. I would only recommend this biography to hungry fans, but I believe that there is another writer that may have been able to do this better.My guess is that Al Parker was a generally wholesome guy that was successful in the porno business. For my money, this was all tease."
1,Astonishingly dull book about a remarkably dull man,"Here is a terrific opportunity to read about a dull, self-absorbed pothead. I found myself quickly thumbing through the poorly written pages to find some substance, any substance in the man known publicly as Al Parker. You can't really blame the author, however. It must be difficult to write with any depth about a ho-hum man doing extraordinary things with his only 'claim to fame'. If you had a facination or fantasy (like I did) about Al Parker keep watching his videos or read about the videos in a far better forum than this book. The most interesting thing about this man is the fantasy. It's cheaper to simply rent a video."
4,Good book made me a bigger fan of Al Parker,I had purchased this book some time ago and Loved reading it. I thought it did a good job of pointing out the events of Al Parker. It illustrated the defining moments and how he was directed into the path he took. If you want to know more about a great porn star then check out this book.
3,This is Getting Ridiculous...,"Why can't anyone compile a decent ""Best Of"" CD for this great band? Well, probably because most of these incompetent ""record execs"" have been raised on crap music, and don't know enough about Procol Harum to handle the task. The fact that no one seems to be able to put this band's 10 or 12 classic songs onto one disc makes it clear as to why the record biz is in trouble, and it's not from downloading. It's overpricing and bad staffing, pure and simple. The songs that are here are just fine, but this disc is lacking."
5,Incredible,"Wow. I cannot believe how one artist could have so many fantastic songs. This is an amazing compilation of his greatest stuff. Before I got this album, I was a casual listener. I knew ""Heard It Through the Grapevine"" and ""Let's Get It On,"" knew that he was a great artist, and was curious. Thank God that I decided to buy this cd. It has ben in my cd player since I got it, and I don't plan on taking it out any time soon. You would do yourself a favor to buy this cd."
4,The top custom knife magazine!,"This is clearly the top choice in custom knife magazines, though Knife Illustrated is also a good choice. It's probably 60% custom / 40% production.The articles are good and insightful, some very high quality color pictures, and it's generally speaking entertaining & instructive.The 4 star only rating is due to (1) the lack of objectivity of the articles (I have *never* read a negative review), and (2) too many pictures of custom knives are in B&W. I would happily pay double the price, get half as many issues, but in a glossy, high quality paper, premium binding, etc..."
2,Not very deep!,"I picked up Bruce & Stan's Pocket Guide to Islam to see if it would be useful for a class I was teaching at church. This is the first book by Bruce & Stan that I have read, so I was not sure what to expect. Their book is well organized, but the content rarely seemed to get beyond the surface of the topics they approach.I have read several books that compare and contrast Islam with Christianity from the Christian perspective. This one is my least favorite. It comes from a pair of academics (they studied about Islam following 9/11 and wrote a book about it). This being true, their comments on further reading (called ""digging deeper"") suggest some good reads. However, they plug their other books more frequently than I found necessary... <Bruce & Stan have written clearly, but not deeply. Depth is what I was looking for..."
2,It's a target.,"Works when it wants to. It's great if you don't mind if it doesn't move. Looks great, is sturdy and feels heavy but in the wrong spots. I think if this product was revamped I would give it another shot, I do like the idea. For now, I'll just stick to the old fashion foam targets."
3,Pretty...,"but don't expect much depth. This album is by Siobhan Maher, a Liverpudlian of River City People and Bangles drummer Debbie Peterson who lives in England. The album is strictly soft, MOR - lots of mushy love songs like Here in My Eyes (Co-written with Gina Shock of the GoGo's) and What Are We Waiting For. The melodies a pretty. One gem: Ask me No Questions: it's not so much the song but the exquisite vocals worthy of the Bangles. In fact, the Bangles covered this in their Doll Revolution album but this version is far superior probably because it employs acoustic guitar alone and doesn't have all the overblown keyboards. The weakest cut is another of Debbie's self-help advice tunes ""The Devil"" (""The devil that you don't know is worse than the devil that you know."") This is the only album these women made save a Christmas song ""Christmas Son"" and another song ""Here Comes Trouble"" which is not available here. IRS went bankrupt after the album went nowhere."
2,Don't get if you don't know the first thing about Capoeira,"I actually rented this from my local library before I decided if I wanted to buy it or not. Thank God I did. The language/ interpreter was extremely difficult to understand EVEN in English. It was interesting to watch but I couldn't stand more than five minutes of it with the interpreter and no subtitles to help understand what is being said.Honestly, if you don't know the first thing about this type of martial arts, you shouldn't get this DVD. It would be great for someone who has been doing this for several years and know the art well but it's definitely NOT for beginners. On the back of the DVD box it even says ""great for beginners"", don't be fooled. If you want to watch how this martial art is done, this DVD is great but for learning it, it's a big fat NO."
1,Very poor! Save your Money!!!,"- The files for the tutorials are not available online, I tried many times until I gave up.- The book covers at a very high level the various areas of 3D modeling with 3D Studio Max but never goes in depth on any of the subjects. As a result by the end of the book I have clicked on many many buttons of 3DS Max but I have not acquired the skills to build a 3D scene.- In my opinion, there is too much blablabla in between the tutorials and not enough in-depth hands on tutorial.- The least you would expect from reading such a book is to be self-sufficient in at least some of 3D Studio Max areas."
2,2 stars is generous,"First off the binding is HORRIBLE! Pages come out very easily, plus the book is made awkwardly!The tutorials suck, if you are going to publish a 3d Design book it needs to be in color with better projects than what are provided. It sucks there are soo few options for 3ds Max right now."
4,great dvd,this dvd is great. it has a bunch of great singers and they have some interesting stories about how their hits came about. very informal setting allows each performer to be themselves. i like the way ralph emery relates to these artist. very entertaining.
4,Two year olds love it,Ordered this video for my granddaughter's birthday. She loved it. It's a song that she is learning at daycare and she was so proud that she could sing along. I reccomend this video for toddlers.
3,"It's a bad start, but it gets better...slightly","I saw the title of Frances Mayes' new book and thought ""Yes, that's for me!"" What I got was an extremely frustrating read - what could have been a fascinating book turned out to be quite good in parts, but often very boring and heavy going. Her references to various poets, authors and philosphers were over-done, and I skimmed over about a quarter of the book, just to get to the descriptions of place and people. A map of the areas she visited would also have been helpful.There were some highlights - Scotland, as other reviewers have mentioned, was wonderful, as was Capri.However, if anyone is thinking of purchasing this book, I would tell them to bear in mind the age of the writer, her interests and also her ego."
2,Mediocre - o.k. at best. They have better.,"What A Life (released mid 80s)is by far their least enjoyable album. Kind of rough around the edges and not as well written, it is a mediocre 2nd effort (as is usual with artists). The one great track is ""Pleasure and Pain"". Their debut ""Desperate""('83 or so),""Temperamental""(1988)and the self titled ""Divinyls""(1990)(that had that interesting Masturbations song) were far more superior works. So if you want a good album try this - but if you want a good Divinyls album try elsewhere."
4,Love to Hate It-Hate to love it,"Some people will love this movie, others will think its complete crap. I was in the middle, i loved and hated it. With its horrible acting, writing, etc. at first i hated it, then as the movie progressed hatred turned to love. This is a violent gross, movie that shouldn't be taking seriously, just have fun watching it in its demented sort of way. I was laughing my ass of one minute and shaking my head in others. A cult classic. If you love gross horror with terrible comedy this is for you."
5,One of the best exploitation films of the 80's,"This film is very entertaining if you're twisted and can handle the gore FX (they get pretty gross at times). I remember watching this gem at a very young age, and I haven't been the same since! It has some really bad jokes and is sometimes too mean-spirited, but I think it's a great example of how to make a successful dark (very dark) comedy. If I were to compare it with another film, it's similar to Flesh for Frankenstein. Don't miss, if you like horror films."
3,Okay condition,"I was looking for a crappy vhs version of Toxic Avenger and that's kind of what I got, so no complaints. I received the movie very promptly which was very nice because I was in a pickle and I even sent this company an e-mail asking if they could get it to me in time and they responded that day. The sleeve for the movie was a bit beat up and the movie was half rewound lol."
3,It it what it is,"Cheesy movie that is a cult classic! Worth a view, but watch it, knowing that it is just cheesy fun!"
4,"Classic early 80s rock (before ""hair-metal"")","UFO is one of my favorite bands, and I have always enjoyed the Paul Chapman era almost as much as the Schenker era. If this describes you, then you will like this cd. If you don't like UFO, especially the four Chapman era albums, then don't get this. And if you haven't heard UFO, you need to do something about that."
5,"A heartwarming, uplifting book for cat lovers","I originally purchased this book in paperback for my daughter, who loves to read stories about animals. She shared several of the stories with me, and I enjoyed them so much that I bought the Kindle edition so the whole family could read it any time they wanted. The stories are inspiring, heartwarming, and a testament to the bonds we share with our furry family members."
5,Dragons,All I have to say is after this book I have seen dragons in a whole new way. I loved reading about dragons before but the human part of this character just kept me wanting to read. I just wish she would write a sequel to this wonderful fantasy.
3,A Decent Quick Read,"Vivan Van Velde is my favorite fantasy author (besides Annette Curtis Klause), but I must admit Dragon's Bait was a little lacking. While the characters are interesting (a young girl and a golden dragon that can shapeship), the plot was not all that provoking or inspired. The book is not as long as her other novels, making this a very good quick read. The book has the same amount of quality and detail in her writing. This book wasn't bad, but it also wasn't very good, either. If you're into Van Velde, then I suggest the Conjurer Princess or Companions of the Night."
3,Coulda been one of his best but it still has some gems.,"Making a 3 disc was probably a mistake. It's not like Prince isn't used to releasing ""lost"" songs(see Crystal Ball, Black Album and Vault). Why not make this a two disc and release the leftovers as time went on.In all honesty, the second disc is probably the best overall. The first one has some gems on it, his cover of I Can't Make You Love Me is nothing short of fantastic. He made it his own and it was exactly what we expect, greatness.I'll say it again, take the best songs and make a two disc album...then it'll be a sold album. Take the absolute best tracks and make one disc and it's a 4 star album easily.Don't sell this one too short, it's got some real gems and even when it's not one of his best songs he throws something in there that makes the song so much better."
4,Interesting...I am enjoying it!,"This reminds me a little bit of The Gold Experience, Come, anda tiny bit of the Batman soundtrack with some totally different stuffthat I have never heard Prince do before. The overall effect gives the album a smooth flow, with Disc 3 being my favorite. I own almost everything Prince has created, and I was so glad to add this one to my collection for such a reasonable price. Die-hard Prince fans and casual listeners alike will not be sorry to have made this investment."
2,description a little incorrect,"This books description in the amazon catalogue listing lists its page count as 320 pages. It is in fact only 90 or so and has only a couple of dozen colour photos of original gowns. Short chapters, uninspiring as a reference book. Im still glad I have it as it does display a few gowns once belonging to Queen Victoria herself, However given the title of the book, I also assumed they all were (a good number of the gowns were American). No accessories, no multiple examples in the same category. If this was the catalogue of the exhibition, it would have been a short visit."
2,Let Down,"The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs, although very well organized and with so many useful entries, fails to explain the meanings of practically most of the proverbs. But if you're really good at guessing meanings by reading examples given (there are plenty of them), you should have no difficulty at all. Not for me."
1,not 100% mechanically compatible with Hyundai Elantra 2001.,"Electrically works, but it must be installed inclined to bolt. Only one screw of the two can be used. Apparently no problem in terms of compatibility with the ECU."
4,Tarzan Boy information,"I am not so much reviewing this album as providing a guide for people to find copies of Baltimora's Tarzan Boy. If you are lucky enough to find an original album or single of the song, you will probably have to shell out $100+. So here are some alternatives on Amazon:Original One Hit Wonders$15.99 new (all prices listed are current as of May 08)$8.67 usedcontains the original album version of the song with the ""Carribean steel band sound""Time Life Modern Rock: Nightclubbing$39 usedContains a 6+ minute extended versionBeverly Hills Ninja: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack$4.65contains the version I heard in the clubs. 3 - 4 minutes in length. This is a dance mix, not the original album mix.2013 update:Europa (part of the disco discharge series)$12.41contains the 12"" mix"
3,Eat Beef!,I liked it because it had a lot of songs that I used to hear on commercials. The Listerene commercial song is on it. It's pretty cool. And please do Eat Beef. I'd also encourage you to look at my review of Mission Impossible soundtrack.
3,Coin Prices Gone,I renewed this publication for my husband. He just received notice that it will be replaced with a different magazine. Hopefully he will enjoy the new one as much or more than the one ordered. Color us both surprised.
5,Great Worksheets,"This is a big book full of fun pattern and number exercises for kids that make learning fun. I thought about creating a book of worksheets to go with my EZ Times Table book, but this book does such a great job, I would rather just recommend this one.Tom Biesanz, author ofEZ Times Table: An easy, visual way to learn multiplication and division by playing with patterns, and making friends with numbers"
4,bought these for a nursing home,"supplies for a local nursing home were running low, so I purchased these with other products to donate to the center."
4,A good printing calculator,"I like the calculator, particularly that it prints negative numbers in red ink. Also it prints well and is pretty fast. It has all the features important in a basic printing calculator and the price was definitely right."
2,Beware the footprint,"Take note of the dimensions 10"" by 8"" and be sure you want to devote this much desk space to your calculator before ordering. I didn't realize they still make them this big, so didn't pay any attention to dimensions. I assume it works well, but I'm sending it back without opening to get something smaller."
5,"excellent product, excellent service","i first saw my brother wearing these sneakers and fell in love with them- wanted them for my husband. my brother had ordered them from some online shoe store and when we went back to the site, they did not have my husband's size. I was not able to find it anywhere else other than amazon.com! Anyway, they make ur foot look slim and sneaker is really cute with jeans and sweatshirt!"
5,An Excellent Debut,"Further, the debut CD from the New Jersey raised Solace, is a breath of fresh air.For starters, if you have never heard Solace, they sound like a Y2K-ready version of old Black Sabbath, with a heavy dose of Soundgarden, and a light sprinkling of the Allman Brothers. Every song is nose to the grindstone rock, bass heavy, dirty, and relentless.The whole CD is superb. If I had to pick a few favorites, I would go the opening track Man Dog, which has a definite Soundgarden feel, and the balad Hungry Mother. Although this CD strikes me as one of those CDs that you listen to over and over again, changing which song you like best, with each listen.Highly recommended."
4,overlooked,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fun to rip on ""80s metal"" - but this is an overlooked gem. Before Europe went commercial, this -- and the follow up, Wings Of Tomorrow -- are their two best and hold up very well critically if you can be open minded and get past your anti-""hair metal"" sentiments. Of course, if you're reading this, you probably don't have those sentiments - but anyway. If you want to be surprised - or you heard ""Final Countdown"" and want something more - get this."
2,"I wish for some help, here.","I recently recieved one of the these for my birthday, and all i have to say is: HP did a lousy job at writing a troubleshooting section in the troubleshooting guide, on the installer CD, and on the website. There is no tech support phone number, or any support phone number of any kind. This is all relevant to me because my computer would not start up when the drive was plugged in, and all they said to do was ""check the cables."" This does not work, but still seems to me to be their main problem solving tactic, along with ""shut the computer down for 20 seconds and then turn it on.If anyone from HP reads this, please note: Your customer support is horrible. Put a little bit of effort into your troubleshooting, etc., please."
4,Please - '1968 / 69' (Acme),"Companion CD release for the Please 'Seeing Stars' offering (see my review). Please was obviously an obscure UK psychedelic band, with little fanfare. Don't believe these songs were ever even put out anywhere - until now on the Acme label. '1968 / 69' is basically twelve fine-sounding demos that the band had never (notably) finished. But as far as I'm concerned - some demos sound JUST as good (in some cases maybe, better) than the finished product. Tunes that make this import (often) hard-to-find title a keeper are ""We Aim To Please"", the well-played ""Break The Spell"" and ""You're Still Waiting"". Personally, I felt that Please made awfully good use of the mellotron. See how you like it. Recommended for fans of Tomorrow, early Pink Floyd, The Doors, The Nice and possibly early Yes."
4,Off Roader,These are great covers with one exception... I mounted my lights on the window frame of my Jeep and the covers do reflect some light back into the cab. But in a pinch I like the ability to flick my lights on without getting out to take the smiley face type solid covers off. If you mount your lights in a position where they cant reflect back into the cab then no trouble. All in all they look great and are functional.
3,"A Wonderful Concert, but an Edited Version of the Album","This is one of the most treasured recordings of the Modern Jazz Quartet. A live album that serves as an introduction to MJQ like no other collection could. However, this is not the complete album. Label M had edited out the introductions to the pieces by MJQ's leader John Lewis. Without the introductions the album loses a lot of its appeal. The introductions frame each song beautifully and provides a lot of intimacy to what could otherwise be a concert in an anonymous hall.Nowhere in the liner notes to this CD is there any mention that the CD is edited. Label M should have warned potential listeners or noted it in its liner notes. Or better yet it should have relased it on 2 CD's."
2,Cheap quality made in China,It is have a strong chemical smell. I do not fell pleased having my kids playing with it.
2,Disappointed,"The picture shows a ball with ""synthetic leather stitched"" on it, and the panels looks stitched. The ball received is different; just one piece rubber - it not good for playing soccer, OK as a toy."
5,fellow musician,"The arrangement on Roman Holiday is very good and the CD is very well produced. Jeff Reid has a very identifiable musical and vocal style that is maintained throughout the entire CD. Although different and truly unique, I would classify his style as a cross between Dire Straits and Tom Petty. His blending in of petal steel,dobro, fiddle, and mandolin is very interesting, tasteful and appropriate without being hillybilly. His musical style just grows on you instantly and there is alot of musical maturity and intellegence in his arraingements.I listen to the CD about 2 or 3 times a week in my car on my commutes to and from work. I would recommend this CD to anyone that appreciates a masterful musical creation."
5,"Excellent Artist , Displays R&B, Funk, and Classic Soul","Carleen Anderson has taken her family's muscial roots of Jazz and Funk and created a wonderful album. She is definitely on the same level as Lauryn Hill, Maxwell, Arrested Development, Speech, and Dionne Farris."
4,Excellent supplementary material,"I am a teacher at a primary school. When I saw 'Madame Doubtfire' on the school's book list, I gave it a read. At first, I was actually a bit worried that my students were too young to understand the given material but I was able to uncover the corresponding tapes. I recommend that younger children (around ages 8-12) read the book with help of the tapes. All scenes serve their intended purpose- the actors' interpretations are great! In particular, the scenes between the parents Daniel and Miranda are excellent. My students thoroughly benefitted from this supplementary matieral. It is a funny book, and deals with relevant issues."
1,Junk,"This excuse for a tool is entirely useless. Also dangerous: if you excert any force on it, the yellow flimsy plastic bit will fall off, and you run a real risk damaging your hand. If you want to accomplish anything useful at all, use a real plane, a spokeshave, or indeed, a sharp knife."
5,"A very good book, but beware recent changes in the law.",I used this book to teach a law school course in the Czech Republic. It has an excellent selection of cases from which to teach the major areas of European Union (or European Community depending on your view) law. Get the most recent available supplement (1996 to my knowledge) and realize that there have been recent significant changes in this area of law.
4,475 watt Kitchenaid stand mixer,This powerful machine along with its new design kneading hook made easy work of the first French baguettes I made after receiving the shipment. The big motor is noiser than the smaller 325 watt machine we previously had but is a small price to pay for that great mixing and kneading power! The pouring shield which was supposed to be included did not come in the box. I emailed Amazon who would take no action. I emailed Kitchenaid without result. I called kitchenaid and forced the issue. They quickly sent the pouring shield without extra cost.
2,Didn't last very long for this price,Only a 3 year replacement warranty and it only lasted 3 years and a few days. Definately not worth the extra money.
4,Enriching and enjoyable,"I do not want to pretend to be a snobbish, elitist scholar. I really like Jack, and maybe I feel charitable toward him in his faults. But I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and it probably helped me to know that this was his earliest post conversion work. It drew me in, fascinated me, I could relate to a lot of it as I came down similar roads, and it taught me things I didn't know while bringing into clearer focus things I did. Also, I read many of his other works before reading this, and I have also read several of his favorite authors and works, so I sort of knew where he was coming from. I would recommend this book to any reader though- only please do read Surprised by Joy at some point if you haven't yet. There is a richness in The Pilgim's Regress. Don't miss it!"
5,Excellent Example of Engrossing,"The ""Universal Penman"" is an excellent example of 18th century engravings. The engravings are amazing. The talent of the artists inspires both the beginning and advanced student of penmanship."
4,A softer version of Miriam Makeba,"In many respects, this album was sleepier than Pata Pata. It's versatile, with some 40's flavored pieces alternating with gospel and African folk-style pieces. Many times I found it difficult to keep my legs still when listening."
4,DOES WHAT IT SHOULD,"An inexpensive but very acceptable item. Nice size and weight. Quick ship at reasonable price (Amazon Prime!)and an all-around very, very good transaction!"
2,Ultimately slight,"Peter Hedges is a writer of modest gifts, who devotes a great deal more attention to the minutiae of brand-name pop culture than he does to characters' interior depths and psychology. With a little more hard crust, and a little less gooey cream filling, he might make something of himself, but so far, no go."
2,Where's The Story?,"I was thoroughly disappointed by this novel.I really liked the characters that Peter Hedges created and he touches on some serious issues; alcoholism, divorce, sexual abuse but where is the story? I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did.Loan this one from the library if you need to read it."
2,"Less Sap, More Substance","I felt cheated after I read this book. It wasn't fair to draw Scotty so precisely, yet leave the other characters (his family) so undeveloped. Did anyone ever explain to Scotty that it wasn't his fault that his mother left? Did anyone ever consider getting Scotty some therapy with a trained counselor? Did anyone attempt to help Joan before she left? Too many unanswered questions and poorly drawn characters left me thinking: ""This book could have been so much better.""What's the point of breaking our hearts if there was never any real substance to begin with?"
4,A GREAT ALTERNATIVE,"I carry a Dell Vostro 1700, (so-so computer at best, great screen though) and because of the weight / size I was looking for a good carry solution. This bag is the one I picked after a little research. I never have been satisifed with laptop backpacks in general, and I wanted something more like a messenger bag.Exterior access of laptop is very handy at the airport security point. The bag handles my laptop (barely) in the dedicated section.No documentation: it will take a minute to figure out the right flip to convert the messenger strap to a backback strap. However, once done and on your back, the pak carries low against your backside and the weight is barely noticeable. Because of the low carry / low center of gravity, there is minimal affect on your posture while you carry it in that mode.Overall I am very pleased with the bag. The nylon straps below the padded shoulder section seem a little flimsy, (7/8"") but are holding up fine so far."
3,"""O Brother"" with some glaring omissions","Be warned that the title of this book is actually ""SELECTIONS FROM O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" This is essentially a guitar tabulature songbook, so some of the most striking songs from the movie/album are missing: ""O Death,"" ""Didn't Leave Nobody But the Baby."" ""Po Lazarus,"" ""Down In the River to Pray,"" ""Angel Band"" (guitar part too simple???). So, anyone expecting a complete songbook of the movie soundtrack will be quite disappointed. For the songs that are there, the tab looks pretty good (sorry, I only play banjo, not guitar.), but keep your reading glasses on, because it's a bit on the small side. The end of the book has a few pages of very clear explanatory notes concerning all the special notations in the book. Overall it's a good book for the guitar player, but I wish that ALL the songs from the movie were included."
3,Question about this book,"Does this book have the tab for the instrumental version of ""A Man of Constant Sorrow""?"
4,Feel the heat.,"This disc will definitely remind you of the movie, but even better than that, it's just a cool bunch of songs. Besides the intro of ""Feel The Heat"" from Dirk, this has 70's classics from ""The Emotions"", ""Marvin Gaye"", ""The Beach Boys"", and ""The Commodores"". My faves would have to be ""Magnet and Steel"", ""Machine Gun"", and the track ""Brand New Key"", because it reminds me of ""Rollergirl"", played flawlessly by ""Heather Graham"". A few lines from the movie itself would have been cool too. Oh well. The only thing I really miss here is ""Jessie's Girl"", but that's on volume 2. Otherwise this is the best soundtrack for your next few ""Boogie Nights""."
4,Great album!,"Boogie Nights is one of my favorite soundtracks of all time. It's so groovy and seventies, with a nice mix of disco tracks, and some mellower stuff like ""Magnet and Steel"" and the Beach Boys classic ""God Only Knows"". I could do without the score track at the end, although I adore Michael Penn. You have to go allll the way through it to get to the hilarious secret song. Night Ranger's ""Sister Christian"" is also pretty cheesy, but it does fit in well. All in all, a great soundtrack to a great film."
3,It is okay for the age group intended,"The EasyPCng is an okay item. It provides about 10 to 15 minutes of distraction for my 18month old and for my 3 year old she is somewhat more enthused. She will spend about 20 to 30 minutes before she get s bored and wants to do something else. Perfect for the child who has a very short attention span, but not ideal for one who enjoys long term entertainment."
5,Don't judge what's on the outside!,"I absolutely loved this book! It was so deep. The fact the couple is married at the beginning really adds a lot to the story. Watching Lawson turn into a new man was beautiful and special. Watching the struggles the two went through together, yet not really being together...that was a WOW!I loved the ""beauty and the beast"" factor. It really added a romantic element to the picture. Lawson had been scarred his WHOLE life; and what Kathrine said at the end really got to me!I can't say much about this book without giving it away. I mostly listened to this story while driving to and from work everyday, and can recall a few times when my mouth popped open. Mostly, it was Kathrine's boss that made my mouth pop open. He was unbelievably evil! Lawson's distrust of Katherine's morals did get on my nerves a bit, but he redeemed himself in the end..."
4,A trip back in time...,"For those of us who still the mourn the passing of this great lady, this book does her memory justice. Good text, great pix, nice overview of the Italian Line. Definately worth the $!"
1,poor purchase,"its really a shame to sell a product like this. ordered a 11, shoes are marked 11 in the soles, my wife , who wears a 9 is wearing them comfortably. poor purchase thank you c laird evans"
4,Comfy and warm,"I work at home and like a slipper that is warm, comfortable, and wears well. So far I can attest to the former, I'll have to wait to judge the latter."
4,"Okay, but Tiberium Sun was better","When I got this game about 3 years ago, I loved it, but after the campien missions frutrated me more and more I just gave up, and played skirmish games. Then I got tiberium sun, and I'm playing it even more than before! Don't get me wrong, this is a very good game, it could just be improved upon."
5,Celestron 52251 Ultima 80ED Spotting Scope,"I bought the Ultima 80ED spotting scope for a trip to Yellowstone this fall. Both my wife and I are glad we had it along. It offered nice crisp views of grizzlies, pronghorn, and bald eagles. This is my first spotting scope so I don't have anything to compare it to but it seemed to perform very well for a medium priced scope. I paid about $400 for it. People that we let take a look though it were also impressed. In fact one comment was ""we gotta get one of these"". This is not my first Celestron product. I also have one of their 8"" SC telescopes. My only beef about the Ultima 80ED is that there is NO eyepiece cover. Come on Celestron, I think you've been at this optics game long enough to know to include a 2-cent piece of plastic on a scope that lists for $870."
3,The Sea Wall Revisited,"Duras' 3rd novel 'The Sea Wall' revisits her own past and appears to be again autobiograpical. For those familiar with her best known work 'The Lover' it runs to a similar postcolonial format. She is believed to have written 'The Sea Wall' first and waited for her family to be gone before she could attempt to tell the truth about her youth, which, she claimed to have done in 'The Lover'. While I found 'The Sea Wall' interesting the novel did not move as smoothly as her other work and was less satisfiying in it's outcome. But as a French postcolonial text with a feminist leaning, it is very interesting especially from a comparative perspective."
2,I cant Steer,"The game has a really cool appearance, however you will find that steering is impossible i played for about 20 min. and im able to steer but i dont think its worth the time it still has problems. Cant say much else other than pick another racing game."
3,Shipped without cap.,"Haven't used the product yet but it arrived without a cap to seal the tube. Without the cap, I feel I will need to use the entire product in one application because the remainder will dry out. The grout may be great but rated three stars since it was shipped incomplete."
5,Never fails to get compliments,"I bought this watch as a Christmas gift to myself several years ago. I always liked the Movado Museum design and found a great deal here on Amazon.I've never regretted the purchase. It gets compliments anywhere I go and it goes with pretty much everything from jeans to a tux. One caveat though: keep a casual backup watch in your collection (I like the Timex Ironman Chrono), as you'll need something when working in the yard, out skiing, etc."
5,"Still a favorite, and a classic.","This book has always been a favorite of mine. Whenever a friend has a new baby, I buy this book for them as I hope to pass on some of it's sunshine. Beautiful, timeless."
5,The Velveteen Rabbit,I am extremely happy with the book I purchased. It was the best price I found and was exactly what I was expecting.
3,Never trust your therapist,"My therapist recommended that I read this book, for reasons unknown to me. It is a good children's book, but not for an adult suffering from agoraphobia."
5,Wonderful story that appreciates with time,"The gentle wording of the story has almost a lilt to it and is lovely for reading aloud at bedtime. Children will enjoy it for the toys that talk, but there are many themes that can be introduced later, such as what constitutes love and that it is possible to look beyond someone's appearance and love them for who they are. I have found the latter theme particularly striking when I read this story to a group of children with disabilities and their peers. This is a wonderful story from all angles, from lullaby and entertainment to gentle fable."
3,Okay for the money,"These towels are just okay for the money. They do leave a lot of lint in the dryer like I read in the reviews, but they are very soft and cozy. Although a few of them have started to show some wear after a year which I wouldn't expect from TH."
4,Crazy Legs is Crazy Fun,My son received this toy for his first birthday and he loved it. He played with it all the time. He is now 2 1/2 and still takes it out to play with. I am planning on purchasing it for my friend's daughter's first birthday.
3,Tops for irritation,"I got this when my daughter was 18 months old. She is now 2 and a half. She never really liked it, only rarely taking it out or pulling it around. It isn't easy to fit the legs into the shapes, which she found frustrating.If left on, it is one of those irritating toys that ""talk"" for hours trying to get your attention. It giggles and says ""ha ha ha play with me! and plays a short run of the same song over and over until your child plays with it, or you turn it off. It is by far the most parent irritating toy she owns."
4,good but weird changes,"ok moonshine is a good book, but in some of the recent books names have changed:Lila kenworthy-leahsundance(jeds horse)-sundowncalla thurston-tharston or a typo if im mistakenits kind of stupid though...an author forgetting her characters names???????????????"
3,Good for a quick answer,"This book contains a child's drawing illustrating a point in each page. However, only one element of the drawing is explained, leaving the rest, and the context of the element in a vacuum. Explanations are simplistic and the logic behind them is left out. Part of learning a technique lies in understanding the thought process involved. If you want to understand why shading depicts anxiety, or why the author arrives at that conclusion, for instance, don't look for it in this book."

5,Great running shoe,"My daughter has bought this shoe 4x and is a cross country runner in high school. She is a slight over-pronator (ankles slightly bend inwards when unsupported or tired during a longer run). They have been very durable shoes and she was able to put lots of miles into them. She also likes and wears Pearl Azumi shoes.If looking for running shoes and have a chance to try them on at a running store and get advice for your gait, that is recommended. Once you find a great shoe, buying on-line can save you lots of money. Especially if you are willing to buy the last year's model or color. If you like the shoe, you like the shoe:)"
4,Works like it supposed to.,"Saw this product in Best Buy. Made the mistake and bought it there first. When I saw the price was almost half at Amazon, I brought it back to Best Buy. To whomever uses Comcast, do not rent their modem. Buy this and you will be satisfied."
5,Motorola SB51501,"I am satisfied with this modem,very easy to install. I had to return Comcast's modem first before they would connect mine. Great value"
3,SB-5101,First one was damaged. Took 8 hours with various techs to find out. 2nd one worked fine right away.
3,Good Modem,"I bought this modem to replace my old Comcast rental modem. I expected to see a big improvement on download speed but it didn't really happen. Anyway, the modem serves its purpose."
1,DOA Used Modem!,"We purchased this modem because of having a DOA modem from another seller that was the SB5101U, and expected to get something better this time because of the good reviews. So this one was also in a box that wasn't original and not even covered in plastic. It would not turn on when plugged in, despite trying multiple outlets. I was so frustrated because of buying two different models of this modem from two different sellers and getting two different DOA used modems. We ended up just going to Best Buy and paying 30 dollars more and making sure we could plug it in and try it before we took it home. Sometimes it pays off to pay a little more and buy from a reliable seller who isn't dishonest like this one. This definitely wasn't a NEW modem."
2,Used Test Surboard Modem no Good,This unit was offered as a used but tested and verified good unit by the business on Amazon.In the end the unit I recieved was defective. This may or may not be a broader issue withthis model. My guess would be that the company involve inadequately tested the unit beforeoffering it for sale.
4,Good,It works nicely. It arrived on time and it comes with the ethernet cable.It is a nice purchase if you don't want to spend too much on a modem.
1,Did Not Last,This modem only lasted about 3 months. I did buy it used so I can't complain too much. But I was hoping to get a little more life out of it. If you are a Comcast customer I recommend purchasing a newer model. At least that is what Comcast tech support recommended.
1,Motorola Surfboard SB5101 Cable Modem,"Unfortunately, I am not happy with this product. I called Time Warner, who is my internet provider and told them I had purchased my own cable modem, which is the exact model I have been leasing from them. They had me hook it up, while on the phone with them, and after registering the serial number they needed, we could not get it to work, trying everything the gentleman could think of and also he put his advisor on, and he could not get it to work. So, I suggested trying to hook up their modem that I had unhooked and sure enough, it worked immediately. So, the cable modem, brand new out of the box that you shipped it to me, did not work. I had no idea how to return the item so sent in my rebate slip for $20 so that I would not be out the $50 it cost to purchase. Not a real happy consumer on this product.Elaine Meyer"
5,A very good cable modem,"I've been using this cable modem for about a year now. I am very happy with the performance of it. It's a ""Recommended to buy"" item."
5,Initial quality of product excellent,I bought the product connected it and was good to go in a matter of seconds. I have only had the product for about a month. The product works as expected. I did some speed tests with multiple computers downloading data and the modem handles everything that my router can send its way. I will probably need to upgrade my router to fully appreciate the Motorola Surfboard's potential.
1,Need to sent back within a month,I got a faulty modem and sent it back to amazon. This modem is only there for 2 months and it sent back to repair. Don't every buy this modem.
1,Purchased new in 2012 got old 2005 unit,"Even though unit was purchased as new, packaging looked new also - standby button didn't work. Opening up discovered surface rust across everything. While unit does connect to internet, I do not have the standby button avail - the one reason I chose this unit. I don't blame amazon, but I would recommend that no one buy from Silverstone LLC ever. Tremendously dissatisfied and taken advantage of. Avoid this business or you'll get something less than advertised also..."
2,Not so hot,"I bought this modem from amazon because I heard from my cable company that it was a good choice. However, when I first installed it, I could not get a connection. After a few calls and rewirings, the modem finally worked. But alas, every few hours, it completely reset and all the lights but the ""PC"" light would go out. Sometimes it wouldn't turn back on on its own and I needed to reset the modem and unplug the cable from the wall. I didn't realise I was buying a used modem, but apparently that was the case, and maybe that's why it's so unreliable. Eventually, I got a new modem from the store in person, and that's working much better."
1,This modem looses conneciton sporadically,"After weeks of still troubleshooting my connection, my cable company in an effort to prove this unit is defective, has hooked up two modems to my cable line in the office. Both modems are identical, when mine fails, the comcast laoner is still lit up. They are on the both line so I know it's not my wiring, the isp, or my signal strength. For what ever reason this particular unit is defective."
3,"Not an easy and ""enjoyable"" read","I have been studying psychic phenomena for quite a while and this book was recommended as a good foundation for astral projection. While it is informative, it feels like a lot of work to read it (note, I do have a graduate degree so I know how to read!). It just isn't engaging and almost written from a scientific perspective. I will continue to plow through this as it is informative but I literally have to force myself to read it and find myself skimming large sections. If you like dry and informative non-fiction, you will probably like this book. If you are looking to be entertained while being educated, I am sure there are better options on the subject."
4,Jane Austen's Guide to Good Manners,"A fun glimpse into everyday Regency life, all based on what Jane would have said or did say. The illustrations are a delight too."
1,Why pay more for a whistle?,"I'm a great fan of ""silent"" dog whistles.No, they are not silent, and yes, the dog needs to be trained to respond to the whistle with treats.I carried this particular whistle on my key chain for about six months, and then, all of a sudden it stopped working. I don't know why. I fiddled with it, but no luck.I'm assuming you get what you pay for, and this one just doesn't hold up over time."
3,"A nice color, and it's authentic...","This tie is authentic and the color is great. But I have two main complaints about it. First, the ""Gucci"" tag on the bag unravelled on one side. Second, the fabric is thick and feels wonderful to touch, but the fabric ""catches"" on everything--even if my the skin on my fingers is dry the roughness will ""catch"" on the fabric.I own other silk ties made in Italy from other brands, and their fabric doesn't have the same problem."
3,"Works great, but jeez, is it big!","The corkscrew works just fine, but it's HUGE. We haven't figured out where we'll store it - it doesn't fit in any of our kitchen drawers!"
1,You Get What You Pay For,"The reason this item is so inexpensive is that it works poorly and they are changing the engineering. It will work okay for a while, but in short order will begin shoving your corks INTO the bottle rather than extracting them. Buyer beware."
2,A disappointment,"In my opinion, the display ad for this item was for a ""Rabbit"" cork remover. We have all read such good reviews of the Rabbit, and how it lasts forever. I believed that we were buying a plain model of Rabbit, it isn't, it appears to be an inexpensive copy, plastic components, and no better than the no name knock-offs. I emailed Metrokane, the Vendor, asking about the difference from the real Rabbit, received no reply. I'm sure that this model will be in the trash in a few months, just like it's predecessors. I recommend that you make sue you are getting a real Rabbit before you order."
3,"Works sometimes, especially when my wife uses it","Since my last rabbit opener came apart at the vertical pin (not permanently repairable), I decided to try this highly praised opener. Haven't found the right combination yet to avoid the corkscrew portion screwing out of the cork instead of lifting it out of the bottle, especially with plastic corks. When it works it's great but, mostly these devices are frustrating --- unlike my sommelier's opener which always works."
5,The best album,"I think this is a great album. I bought it mainly for the songs Everlong and Monkey Wrench, but I ended up loving the whole CD. I recommended it to anyone who likes rock."
4,More punky than Nirvana,"The Colour And The Shape is the last VINYL new-release I have been able to get hold on. That in itself makes it a record I treasure.But the music is very good rock too. Don't expect to hear Nirvana Part II or somethin'. The roots are the same, but the Foo Fighters play more punkish grunge rock than Nirvana. It's ore straight forward, and especially less self-destructive than Nirvana.Apart from the great hits Everlong and Monkey Wrench, the track February Stars is an absolutely great song. I'm gonna play it on my birthday...Clearly the best album the Foo Fighters have released!"
5,FOO FIGHTERS ROCK!,"EverlongAt the age of ten, i was given an album called ""Woodstock"". Since then i have attended many concerts. I saw tbe Foo Fighters a couple of years ago, and i must say, they are one of the hardest working bands in the music industry. I have attended concerts where the bands just wanted to get it overwith and go on. Not the Foo Fighters. They not only rocked the crowd, they also came out to the arena shaking the fans hands. Foo Fighters, ""ROCK ON!"""
5,Solid,"Great album, catchy but not overtly so, from soft silly vocals on ""doll"" to the semi metal screams of ""enough space"". Even though my hero and everlong have been played millions of times they're still great songs and all the other songs on the album are just as good, if not better. Play it right through, there's no slow spots."
3,Don't be fooled by the extras,"I thought this would provide some great extras songs, but was very disapointed by the extras, the quality is poor and the songs slow. Do your research and buy the original release, not this extended version.I love the Foo Figthers, but this CD will give you a bad taste, do your research."
3,More uneven than first album,"There are some great songs and some awful songs on here. On this album, Dave Grohl decided screaming sounded good, and decided to put it prominently throughout the album, which ruins ""Wind Up"", ""Enough Space"", and ""New Way Home"". There's a lot of filler, but songs such as ""Monkey Wrench"", ""Hey Johnny Park!"", ""My Hero"", ""February Stars"", and ""Everlong"" are great. But I don't know if that's enough to recommend the album."
3,See Through,"The product was nice, but just wanted to give you a heads up that it is very see through! I had to buy white pants and a white tank top to where underneath it. Any ""under items"" you wear underneath it can be seen fully."
5,Secret World of Flies finally REVEALED!,"The book is a masterpiece of illustrations and insights into the secret world of flies. This book allows us for the first time to get a real glimpse at what flies might actually think, feel and say if they were able to communicate. It's a page turner. The drawings are hysterical while at the same time nauseating. I chuckled, I laughed, and by the end of the book I was in tears. Casteel and his co-illustrators have really hit upon some powerful subject matter with this one. I would encourage everyone to pick up ""Poop with Flies"" and run with it! It's a winner! I've never read anything like it. I'm already looking forward to his next work!"
5,A structure for planning for possible library disasters,"From damage by fire or water to handling the emotional impact of library systems which come to a crashing halt, this provides the working librarian with a structure for planning for possible library disasters. Chapters cover the basics of handling damaged collections and systems, and provide excellent depth and detail on the recovery options and solutions to common problems."
2,Not as I wanted,Hi.... It is not as good as the one I have already which is hemp lip balm . It is the best I have used yet ..thank you.
2,emporrio armani watch,"I bought the watch for a gift, but I'm really thing can be made of better material and have a better look."
2,Disappointed,We registered for most of the malawi theme. However unfortunatly when the pictures arrived there was shipping damage. The quality of the wood frame is very poor. The pieces are glued together instead of an actual frame. Please be aware if you are to have these items shipped. You are better off going to the store to purchase.
2,Interesting storyline but so poorly written,"Highland Fling is a great example of a writer who had a good idea and then apparently did not have the writing skills to do justice to it. Like Wild Designs, the characters are poorly fleshed out and the narrative doesn't flow as it should -- that said, to its credit, Highland Fling is a better attempt than Wild Designs."
2,"Tired, formulaic, sloppily written","I used to enjoy some of Katie Fforde's earlier romantic novels, but now she seems to be rushing off a book a year simply to meet her publication deadlines. Highland Fling rehashes Fforde's overworked formula of an ordinary, rather scattered heroine who somehow manages to attract a gorgeous, highly desirable hero, all the while denying her own attraction to him and repelling him with rude, immature behavior at every turn. This book is so sloppily written and cliched, it feels like Ms. Fforde must have dashed it off in a couple of days."
3,"Nice earrings, however......","This is a nice little hoop earring. I have been looking for a really small pair of white gold diamond hoop earrings and these were exactly what I had in mind. The problem is that the diamonds are not very good quality. The diamonds are quite cloudy, but since they are so small, you really can't tell unless you look very closely. There is still some sparkle, mostly from the white gold prongs that hold the diamonds in place. If it were not for that, I would rate them 5 stars. I did keep them because the size is so perfect and the price was right, plus free shipping. Overall, they are OK."
5,A MUST READ FOR ALL CHURCH LEADERS,"This book tackles the hard questions which come up in church conflicts. The author speaks with authority and makes practical application from scriptural principles. He does an outstanding job of describing the 6 stages of a church conflict and contrasts the natural response to the Biblical response in each stage. It is practical and it is pertinent.If this book were required reading in every church in America, church splits would become almost extinct. Read the book now and prevent problems in the future!"
2,Good for days when you can't get to the gym,"I am one of those people that hates going to the gym so for days when I can't get myself out of the house, I picked this up. It's better than nothing but be warned that it's really not much of a workout. You can get moving on it and the speed and level of exercise is really up to how fast you move and how much you attenuate muscles while moving but since it's a glider, there is no resistance at all. You won't break a sweat on this, elliptical users: unless you're really hammering out a run, which it's a little too lightweight to feel safe doing, it doesn't get the heart rate up the way a bike or elliptical with resistance does. Still, if you aren't doing anything else, it'll at least get you off the couch and it really does fold up tiny. I live in a minute apartment and it fits behind the TV stand against a wall. Open and in use, it takes up about the space of a double bed, maximum. Not a bad unit but again, not going to make you huff and puff."
3,meh...,"This thing is kind of a pain in the arse, and not in a good 'workout' way. It's a pain to setup, a pain to store. The calorie counter is definately off. I gave this 3 stars because my boyfriend loves it. But, I'm not going to lie, he's wierd."
4,Excellent excerise work out machine,The Gazelle is easy to put together and start using. Very easy on joints and easy to use. My Doctor told me I could use this machine and not treadmill because of foot problems. Husband and I both use it. Start your day with a 20 minute work out on Gazelle.
5,Happy I bought it!,"I don't exercise because of bad knees, wrists and lower back. I purchaced the Gazelle because it was low impact and I needed to give something a try. I love this product. It was very easy to assemble, it shipped fast, and after a week of using it my joints haven't been bothered by it. I recommend this product to all that hate to exercise. It is perfect."
2,Fitness computer does not work,"I love the Elliptical itself but the fitness computer that comes with it looks like it does a lot of wonderful things, but the one that came with ym machine does not work. Very dissapointed...tried to get a new one but would have to ship the whole unit back and I can't even lift the box myself....Hassle...."
3,Light exercise machine,"The Gazelle Edge is pretty good for the price, but it's not an energy demanding machine. I can use it for 1/2 hour and not even get my heart beating very fast.But you can place it in front of the TV, rather than sitting on the couch, and it's quite enough to easily watch a TV show to pass the time.All in all it's pretty good for using by a TV and getting more exercise than being a couch potato.It would be better if it had some type of resistance ability to make moving your legs more difficult for better exercise."
3,So far getting toned,I recieved the Gazelle Edge about a week ago; I ordered it because we are all overweight and this was priced right and had alot of good reviews.My kids and I assembled it in a fairly short amount of time. The kids were fighting over it on the first few days we had it about who was getting on it and when. I can already see a difference in my kids shapes(getting toned). They have used it from 15-75 minutes and a few days not at all. I am impressed with it to see changes after using it for about a week.UPDATEI have lost weight by using this product but with in 6 months the computer stopped working and they want $50+ shipping to replace it. What a crock that is! The computer calorie counter/timer was one of my favorite features of the machine because of the convenience of not needing to go into another room to look at a clock or having to carry a kitchen timer into the room and it was nice to know how many calories I had burnt and how long I had been on the machine.
3,Disappointed,"This is the second Gazelle I've owned - my first one lasted 6 years. Within 2 days of starting to use the new Gazelle, it started vibrating and squeeling or squeeking. It doesn't do this constantly or continuously, but most of the time. I use it 1 hour in the morning and 1 hour in the afternoon."
4,Better than I'd hoped for......,"Gazelle EdgeThis was much easier to put together than I thought it would be and I was so glad it actually does fold up as stated and can be kept out of the way while not in use. This is exactly what I need to protect my knees as I get older. I was always a runner, so this was a good transition! Great price as well!Susan"
1,This Damaged My Hamstrings & Knees - Fine Before,"I have nothing against Tony Little or his products. Someone left this machine in our garage for free. I used it for a few months to develop some serious chronic hamstring leg and knee problems. I'm always in pain now because of it. The pain and lack of movement doesn't go away. I was fine before only with a year old lower back issue. My left knee developed a serious problem and then the back of my legs are in bad shape from use of this machine. I have to invest in a chiropractor now. I'm a woman, 48 and would like to caution older people that this product can do more harm then good."
4,a moderate workout,"This is a smooth machine. Easy to use and move. My husband likes it, I don't care for it too much. It works well but the workout is not intense enough since there is no tension. I knew that when I bought it so that is on me. I get bored on it before I get tired. If you are looking for a light or moderate workout this is great, but if you are looking for a challenging workout you probably won't be happy with it."
4,Gazelle Edge,"This is a smooth little unit for a small apartment The computer read out has never worked but perfection of this,I'm sure, comes at a bigger price.It was pretty easy for my buddy and I to put together.It is quiet and thus doesn't bother my neighbor downstairs.Fine for the money."
4,Best bet for the money,"I bought the Gazelle about 4 months ago. It's been a really great machine for the money. I bought mine at Wal Mart just because of the convenience. When I first got it, my legs hurt the first few days, so I went back to the manual to see exactly how they say to use the machine. Once I changed my stance and followed their advice the pain went away. I wouldn't say this machine is for someone who's looking to loose a lot of weight. I use it about 4-5 times a week just to help keep in shape with my busy schedule. I love that it doesn't take up much room and can be easily folded and transported for storage. Overall, I would say that it's a great buy. There isn't any resistance, but there are ways to use the machine to get a good workout."
5,Nice low impact starter machine.,"I have been wanting a gazelle for years, so I finally broke down and bought one, and for the price, you cannot ask for a better deal. It was easy to assemble, and did not take long to master the balance. It is a nice impact free exercise to do in the comfort of home--i actually enjoy it. It folds nicely, but it is bulky to move around to store, but once again for the price, you cannot expect any more from it. I am fit anyway, but I like being able to maintain while I'm watching T.V. Doing a variety of positions and utilizing the full range of motion makes a big difference. I can hit my target heart rate, and I experienced quite a bit of soreness at first. Like any fitness machine, it is what you make of it, but I am very happy with my purchase."
3,Gazelle Edge,"The machine is a good bang for the buck, but it's not the end all fitness machine. You have to ride the machine pretty rigorously to get a good workout and the back bearings tend to grind a bit. However, for $100 you can't really beat the price. I'd recommend it if you are looking for something cheap and/or have limited space."
4,Good Product for Price,"For the price of this, it is a good work out machine. I was a little wobbly at first, but gained my balance quickly"
3,good for what it is,"my Power Plus finally fell apart [it's heavier-duty than this model, and the resistance can be adjusted], and i discovered that not only are they no longer available but also there are no parts to be had. so I purchased this one, which is all there is. it's ok, but I miss the greater resistance. what i like about gazelles is that arms and legs both get worked without strain on the joints [i've yet to find an eliptical or climber that doesn't work my knee joints instead of my muscles]. this model is easy to fold up [and unfold again!]. i lean mine against a wall, where i built a rest for it; and i use it daily."
5,Love the swing of the thing,"I purchased the Gazelle for my grandaughter . She has ashma and cannot participate in gym class. she does not do any running or get much excercise and she is a young teenager. {13) She was starting to put on some excess pounds, and was very unhappy. I discussed the situation with her doctor and he suggested a low impact cardio device. I chose the Gazelle. What a blessing. She uses it everyday,starting at 5 minutes at first and is now up to 20 minutes a day. Now we are all useing the machine.I am 64 and have no problems with it. I am so glad I made this purchase.My son in law put it together in less than 20 minutes.And the price was well below advertised on tv. Thank you Amazon, you came through again."
2,GAZELLE EDGE,"The price is right and it does give me some exercise, but not much. It is bulkier than I wanted, even when folded up. The action is more like a ride than actual muscle exertion. I think it would be too dangerous for most elderly persons to manage getting on & off. I use mine, since it is all I have & it is too hot outside right now. But I really wish I hadn't purchased it. Positives-- it is exactly what they told you it is; it is well made & stable (does not tip or rock); it does fold (easily) so you can lean it against the wall & regain the floor space."
4,"Good light workout for advanced excercisers, Great workout for beginners","I bought this machine for my husband, who hates cardio. He's probably done it once a week since I bought it 4 weeks ago. That's more cardio than he's done in 2 years, so I consider it a success. I'm in fairly good shape, so I have a hard time getting my heart rate up on this machine. It's equivalent to a brisk walk. I like it, though - sometimes after a rough day at work all I can do is a light workout (and I certainly can't walk in the wintertime in Ohio). The biggest bonus is that you can watch tv while you do it.I also get a great stretch in my leg muscles, and I find that I can make the arm workout quite challenging. However, I think the calorie counter is way off. It may be correct for someone who is 250 lbs, but I don't feel like I'm burning as many calories as it claims."
3,After a few years...,"I got this as a Christmas gift a few years ago and still use it almost everyday for sometimes up to 3 hours. It now squeaks when I use it and the ""5-function workout computer"" broke after the first year of use. It still works though after all these years so I give it a 3 stars for that. It was very inexpensive too. Although, I'm planning on getting a full elliptical machine soon."
2,Computer thing didn't work,"This machine seems is a great buy, but on mine the computer that tracks calories burned doesn't work. Otherwise I like it"
3,Pretty good (for a soft stuffed toy),"My dog did de-stuff this toy relatively quickly, though it did take longer than the average stuffed toy. What I liked was that the squeakers are sewn into their own fabric pocket inside the toy, so they don't just fall out with the fluffy stuffing. That way they work longer, and if you're concerned about your dog swallowing the squeakers you can get take the squeaker out yourself once your dog [inevitably] removes the stuffing.Also, the outside off the toy lasted a long time after its insides were dismantled. It gave my dog several weeks of fun just shaking it around and tugging on it, until a day when he was frustrated enough to shred it. But most soft toys don't last this long with my dog. I'm not sure what it's made of though, so avoid letting the dog swallow it. This is always true, of course, but whatever makes this tougher to play with also probably makes it tougher to digest!"
4,excellent condition,"It's what the image describes... I hope it will work fine in my computer... I am not going to need it from a while... but when I will use it, it would help me..."
5,It is what it is...,"What can I say, it's a cable and it does what it's supposed to do. The cable seems sturdy and the connectors are strong. I don't foresee having any problems with it."
5,"Like everybody said it ""Classic""","I am embarassed to say I first bought this CD last week. There are few song familiar maybe from radio play from half decade ago, but now I have to listen all the songs if I play this CD. Great track by Master Dre, and swinging rap by Snoop. What more do you want from hip hop? If you are not satisfied with this CD, start making your own music.One of the greatest moment of Hip Hop."
5,Da bomb greatest rap album ever,When you talk about rap this is it.In my opinion and many other peoples the phatest rap album ever waxed you never hear any complaints about doggystyle
5,THE BOMB,"This CD is like the sequel to Dre's Chronic, which is my all-time favorite CD. This is a MUST BUY if you like Chronic as it has the same subject matter with Dre's master beats only this time with Snoop rapping mostly. GREAT CD."
5,It's a crime if you don't have this cd!,"Whether or not you're even into hiphop, you should have this cd just the same. it's a favorite even among heavy-metal rockers. Get it now! Anyone without it sucks!"
4,Some of my all-time favorite lyrics,"From the song: Ain't No Fun (If My Homies Can't Have None)Leave your number on the cabinetAnd I promise baby, I'll give ya a callNext time I'm feelin kinda hornyYou can come on over, and I'll break you offAnd if you can't f__k, that day, babyJust lay back, and open your mouthGENIUS!!!! GENIUS!!!!!!"
5,If Snoop had a greatest hits album then this entire album might as well be in it!,"Seriously, rarely have I ever heard an album where every song is fantastic. This album is one of those rare albums. There was nothing like it back then in 1993. Dr. Dre's production is mindblowing and outstanding and Snoop's never had better flow than this album. Also, every other artist featured in this album like Warren G., Nate Dogg, Lady of Rage and Kurrupt totally add to this album. In rap it's often the case that too many featuring artists ruin the stew but not on this album. This album is solidly great from start to finish. A true gem and milestone of gangsta rap. No serious rap/hip-hop fan should go another day without listening to this album from start to finish at least once in their lifetime."
1,"Snoop Be Doopy-Doop, PUH-LEEZE","What can I say, this is aural pornography. I'll tell you, as a proud woman, I can't stomach this type of thing, with the B-word thrown around so freely. I know Mr. Dogg has been in the business for many years, and he has earned his success the hard way. That doesn't mean we independent ladies (unite!) need to like it. Gin and juice? I gots no use! Pass the lysol, this cd stinks up the room."
1,Snoop - Doggy dogg is the most popular singer I like,Snoop - Doggy dogg is my favorite rapper. I first heard his Who am I CD. then I seen him on BET> I thought he was one of the most sexiest Black man I had ever seen. Every since I seen him I went out and bought all of his CD.
5,g-punk up,dre should had kept his beats this the way snoop should still rap this way snoop dogg sucks but snoop doggy dogg is off the chain you got ta get this album you can lisen to this album all the way throo get this g 2 me piece.
2,Snoopy no no,"I don't think the music on this disc does a very good job mixing rap with funk. I think it's more along the lines of straight up rap. I could be wrong, and I probably am seeing as how everyone would disagree with me (that's usually a good sign I'm wrong). I have to stand by what I think, though."
3,Lots of ads,"Its ok reading material. There's alot of ads but it's not too bad I guess, even better if you live where most of the ads seem to be from."
5,Pure Nostalgia,"Another Christmas gift item requested by an adult daughter. I love listening to it, as well. I have ""In Concert"", which I prefer, but this PP&M album has some classics, as well."
5,my favorite perfume of all time,i love this perfume. i have been wearing it for about 8 years now. its very sexy smelling. not floral at all. im very picky about fragrance due to allergies and this one is just perfect.
4,Boss women,I bought this product because I wanted to try a new brand and I am so happy with this choice
3,Marvin Gaye's music Dvd,"I love Marvin Gaye. However, the dvd wasn't what I was expecting. Although it was a nice one. I had expected more music and less interviews. Faye"
5,Ranch /Ranch,"I live in New Zealand, where this band has never been heard of.A friend of mine bought a copy second hand in a local music shopand got me to listen to it - he thinks it's great and obviouslyso do I , to the extent that I keep looking at this site for their next release!. What makes the album for me is the snappyguitar playing and the tightness of the three guys that areplaying in this band. They are right into what they are doingand to my mind, deserve more recognition. Are they well knownin the states? - they ought to be."
5,BIG TALENT FROM DOWN UNDER,"Keith Urban is Australia's most talented guitar player as well as being an excellent singer and songwriter. Along with Peter Clarke and Jerry Flowers I have followed this group since its inception, and Keith inparticular from 1992. He has won numerous awards and is most deserving. He is such a nice person who's talent just shines! He is one of the most 'down-to-earth' artists who loves performing, always providing a fabulous show and he genuinely enjoys taking time in speaking to his fans. ""Just Some Love"", ""Ghost in the Guitar"" and of course ""Desiree"" bring tears to the eyes. Good on you boys for a job well done...Australia is behind you and can't wait for the groups next albumn!"
5,Efficient at accomplishing what I wanted to accomplish,"Which was getting the CCNP as quickly as possible. I believe I was taking one exam per week at the time, and using only these books. Never cracked the CD's. I have some experience, though. I assume at this date nobody who isn't working in the industry is still wasting their time trying to get in with certs but no experience, so I presume if you're trying to get your CCNP you already use routers and switches. If you do, these books are certainly enough, I passed all the exams fairly handily and in rapid succession. This was back in 1999 with these same books (I bought them individually)."
5,Great job on the seller's part,"Book was in excellent shape, received the book in a timely manner, overall great"
5,Just in time!,The Crumley's have written a book that all Americans and especially our leaders should read. In light of what happened September 11th we must be ready for anything. Few terrorists could write as chilling a tale but don't think for a minute they aren't schemeing to continue their evil acts.
4,Achieving maturity and a delicious beat,"One of the most popular bands to come out of Spain during the 90s, ""Amistades peligrosas"" achieves in this record a new level of musical maturity. With rythms and sounds clearly influenced by north African and arabic music, this work takes the band into the realm of Religion, Spiritualism and some other Universal themes that had been absent from their previous productions. For anyone who's into World Music with a jazzy twist, or for those diehard fans, this is certainly Amistades Peligrosas best album ever."
2,AMISTADES PELIGROSAS - NUEVA ERA,De hecho sus otros cd's desde mi punto de vista fueron mejores. Traten de escucharlos.
3,More of a crash&burn course in Java,"Unless you have some former knowledge in OOP and a little more than basic understanding of programming for the Internet, you'll consider yourself an even bigger idiot if/when you reach the end of the book. The chapters are very short and cover vast amounts of knowledge with very little words to explain it. You end up with a handfull of jokes but less than a nutshell of Java. A newbie in programming? this book is not for you. Don't have enough laughter in your life? you might just find this a bargain. :)"
5,The NV Review,"This soundtrack is a wonderful way of celebrating the movie ""Romeo and Juliet."" The soundtrack was wonderful and I highly suggest if you like classical and vocal music, that you should buy this CD. I didn't like the movie pieces in the soundtrack. When you listen to the songs there are a few interuptions of the actors and actresses speaking during the song. All in all I really enjoy it!"
1,The downward sprial,"Unfortunately, Elizabeth Lowell has gone from writing excellent romance, to good romantic suspense, and now to only average straight suspense. The rich characterization that has generated such a large fan-base has been abandoned in favor of tediously dull ""thrillers"" that are anything but. As a fan, I do feel sold out by her past few books. This particular book plods through boring subject matter, with little action and depressingly one dimensional characters. Authors do grow and change, but Lowell's changes of late have not been for the better. After this book, I will no longer purchase her works, but wait for the library copies to free up."
2,Time to Read Something Else,"I have read Ms. Lowell before and always enjoyed her writting. This book, however, is slow, slow, slow. I thought the characters were wooden and uninteresting. I also found the plot to be something like the snow and ice of the book, something to be plowed through. Overall, I would say that there are more interesting books out there and, if you are thinking of reading this one, you might like to take a pass."
4,Enjoyable but requires concentration,"While I enjoyed this book, I found it sometimes difficult to keep track of all the characters and their relationship to one another. It was definitely helpful that the author included the family tree at the beginning of the book. But with so many of the ancestors named AJ, it took concentration to follow along correctly. I did, however, enjoy the answer at the end. At least it was surprising how the culprit pulled the whole thing off."
3,Disturbing ending,I found this book and its characters pretty interesting right up until the end. I guess some people can tolerate more than others....I found the incest to be rather disturbing. I still gave the book a 3 only because I did enjoy it right up until the end. It would have been a much better book with a little different ending.. in my opinion.
3,"Its like this, Cat","I enjoyed reading this book and I Thought it was very interesting. Its about a teen who lives in New York and who's kind of lonely. His dad is sort of cranky and his mom does not talk a lot. But then he gets Cat.His new cat is actually named Cat because he couldn't think of a better name. He gets Cat from an old lady that lives next door to him. The book isn't so much about Cat but about him making new friends, going to a new school and getting a girl friend, stuff like that.I thought this was a very good book and I would advise you to read it. In the end Cat does not die or anything like that. You know, the dog or cat always dies at the end of all the other books."
1,Am I missing something?,"The book just ended -- there was no conclusion, was there? Dave goes on a sort-of date with Mary, Tom announces, out of the blue, his pending marriage with Hilda and the decision to join the Army; Pop, who's been looking out for Tom, does nothing but offer him a toast -- and then what? Nothing? I've never in life read a book that felt, as this one did, that it just ... stopped. I tried to turn the page -- and there was no page to turn to. Help me out here. Were all of you convinced that the book had any kind of ending? Perhaps the Kindle edition is in error? I hope there's more to this book than has met my eye."
5,A great resource,"This book is a fantastic resource. I am sure I will be referring to it numerous times in the future. Good for newly diagnosed to read in full, but also a great book to turn to in times when you need clarification regarding certain issues."
4,good read...,I bought this because I saw it sitting on the table in Jay-Z's Fade To Black movie during the scene where he was at Rick Rubin house. This book is definitely a good read. Definitely something to pick up from time to time to stay up on your mystical game.
1,A Collection of Pathetic Lies,From a mentally deranged sub-literate conspiracy nut with close ties to nazis and Holocaust Deniers.
4,so far so good,"Still working an getting a good tripod to use with it. My cheap tripods definitely dont work well with it, when even a breeze causes the scope to move while bird watching."
4,good for price,this is great fo the price. - not high quality - hard for low light compared to high end optics... great bang for the buck.. life time waranty and works well for seeing deer and elk at 1-5 miles away - great first time scope.
2,Cheap but not sweet!!,"I have had many scopes before trying this one and based on all the good reviews on Amazon and I purchased a Celestron 52250. The Celestron has good image quality only at 20X but at the higher magnifications the image deteriorates dramatically, the eye relief is not good either.After using it for a year and 3 months the prism has gone dark and I can no longer see through the scope, it's junk. My advice, would be to spend a little extra and go for a Kowa or Leica, you won't regret it."
4,Very good for the price,"I love this cheap spotting scope ! For that price it's an excellent choice. Waterproof (well, never let it fall into the water...) and very light it's easy to carry around. Bright. It only shows some blueish aura around object with high magnification, but nothing to kill you, specially not for that price.I have compared it to Svarowskis, and there're big differences, but I wouldn't pay 10x more ...so I'm happy with it"
5,PCMCIA card does it all,"I bought two of these to use with Dell Latitude C610 laptops. I had earlier versions of PCMCIA cards from various manufacturers that would not work in a particular location. I discovered I needed to access wireless WPA2. These fit the bill just great. Cannot beat them for price and reliability. Easy to use software too. So if you have a WiFi network that uses WPA2 security encryption, and your current card doesn't work, get one of these! Works great."
1,Worthless,"I bought this card to use on my Windows XP. It has been trouble since day one!! Dropped connections, lack of support, inconsitent performance and now I am having trouble getting the company to simply return my money. It worked great for one day and then it wouldnt keep the connection. I did technical support, upgraded drivers, re-installed, etc. It was working fine until I moved from my desk to a table itlost the connection and then went dead completely. I have spent more time trying to get this worthless equipment to work than being on line maintaining my buisness. I will never never buy a Belkin product again!"
1,"No feedback, no functionality","Product had no indicator lights to tell whether it was working or not. Turned out not to be working.Never got to know how it would have functioned, if it had worked as advertised. Returned product."
3,Heads Up! - Pay attention to details,I'm sure this product will work when I exchange the version I got(8000) with an older version. Tech support advised that versions 1000-6000 only will work with win98/me. Not versions 7000 or 8000. So pay attention to the outside of the box. I had to call around in my area and get the associates to check boxes for me. Finally found a store that had what I needed.
5,"I Love Ama Diab, He Is The Best Here In Canada:):):)",Ama Diab is one of the best Arabic singers in Canada. We all love him Cause he is got the Beautiful Voice. Olivia!
2,Small man's watch face dial,For a man's watch the face dial was smaller than expected. Returned the watch for another Movado Gentry model.
3,ehhhh.... could have gone without!!,For the cost of this set... ehhhh... well I bought this because my son LOVES Thomas and he ALWAYS dumps his plate and bowl... these are NO DIFFERENT just more EXPENSIVE! The suction isn't really attached to the plate or bowl so my son actually pulled plate off and suction was still on high chair tray.... so that didnt work! Debating on superglueing the suction on.
5,Love the product. Like the price.,Lara Bar makes the best food bar. Amazon had the best prices at the times ($14 for pack of 16).
5,Love the quality and taste of the Larabar!!,Been eating these for years and with the many flavor selections I like the variety they never get old. The taste of the peanut butter and jelly is one of my favs as well as the Cashew. You feel full after eating them so they are good for work when you can't stop for lunch or a mid day snack to keep your energy up. Their not full of sugar so the energy last for a long time!
4,YUM!,This is a tasty & healthy raw snack option that would be absolutely perfect for me if it was just organic too. Please GO ORGANIC Larabar!????
2,Not as fresh as when I buy them at the store,I was very excited to be able to order a box to work instead of having to remember to bring them from home but the quality was not as good as when purchased at Whole Foods or Trader Joes.
2,just okay,"I just thought I'd give these a try being all natural with such a short list of ingredients. Basically they are just okay... The flavor is dominated by the dates. I just use them as a snack bar, but I basically try to find something else to eat instead."
4,Tastes good,This bar is good. It tastes like eating a banana mixed in with some nuts. I like that it doesn't have any sugar added and it just uses the natural sugars from the banana to flavor the bar.
2,Thought it was different,"I did like the taste of this bar, but I thought (from the description of the bar that was given) that it was going to have more of a crunch to it. It was too chewy, I wanted it more crunchy. Other than that it was ok."
2,Taste OK but not the texture,"I love Kind bars and when I saw this listed as a ""fruit and nut food bar"" I thought I was orderingsomething similar. I ordered the cherry pie flavor and it does taste like that but the texture islike you took the liquid part of cherry pie filling and made it thicker and formed it into a bar. Noactual pieces of fruit and no nuts, only a few tiny pieces scattered through out the ""jelly"" thatwere light in color and presumably are tiny nut flakes. This is more like the candy fruit slices yousee at the holidays than what I consider to be a fruit,nut bar. Did not like this at all."
1,Coconut Cream Pie Flavor...YUCK,I love many flavors of Larabars and like how they are raw and simple. I bought one of this flavor to see if I wanted a box...no way. You get the coconut that hits your taste buds first...then you are instantly smacked with an aftertaste of *SOAP*! Terrible. I tried 3 bites to see if it got better...NO. I'd never recommend this although I do like other flavors.
2,"Healthy option, but Not so palatable","I liked the fact that this product has a simple ingredient list and I could find gluten and dairy free protein bars. So after hearing much about these, I decided to try them. I tried various flavors, but still I just don't like them. The texture is probably the worst part, I just find it gross and gummy. As for taste, they're rather bland. I think there are better tasting healthy options out there. As for me, I won't be purchasing these again."
2,"love larabars, but these bars fell apart",very crumbly. what a mess! We eat larabars on a regular basis and this combo crumbled out of the package.
4,Pretty Good Option for Gluten Free,We buy these to keep on hand when time is short and we need a quick snack between school & sport practices. There are not a lot of gluten free options that are not high in added sugar. We like these and Think Thin bars.
4,jojo,"Love these Lara Bars. Its the perfect snack with all natural products, no gluten, no additives. it doesn't get much better than this!"
5,"Larabar, how I love you!","I have been on a journey to shed weight and have lost over 100 pounds. I got all the junk food out of my diet and turned to natural whole foods like lean meat, nuts, fruits, and lots of veggies. I wanted to find something I can bring along with me in my purse and when I travel that was easy and healthy. My personal trainer told me about Larabar and now I am hooked. Of all the flavors I love these best: Lemon, Cherry Pie, Chocolate Chip Brownie, Blueberry Muffin, and Banana Bread. Yum!"
5,healthy and gluten free,"Cherry pie is my favorite - just the right combination of sweet and tart. I keep these on hand when I'm on the go and need to have an available snack. They're expensive, but worth the convenience."
2,Not the best Larabar,"I really like Larabars in general and was stoked to get blueberry ones, but these don't taste like blueberries at all. They're more like unsalted cashews that have a weird sweetness to them. Get the Apple Pie or the Cherry ones, those rock!"
5,Decadently Delicious!!!,All the Larabars I have tried have been wonderful but the Coconut Cream Pie ones are absolutely decadent!!! They taste as yummy as your grannie's Coconut Cream pie did with none of the guilt. The taste is sweet but not overwhelmingly so. The coconut flavor is prominent and will delight your tastebuds. I highly recommend the Larabar Coconut Cream Pie bars for a bit of sweetness that is actually good for you.
5,what a book!,"This is a wonderful book; it examines much less talked about lives of women in ancient Egypt. I find, Joyce Tyldesley, a writer of immense power, who can bring a world that we know comparatively so little about so close to us. I like her style, not dry and yet not overly flowery, and most importantly not inventing anything that is not there. She takes information and examines it without building any falsification around it. History is interesting and beautiful with out anyone actually inventing anything. Joyce Tyldesley have done an exemplary job, which cannot be compared to some of our other historical literature. It is a refreshing female perspective on lives of women of Ancient Egypt. I could not put the book down until I finished it. I want to thank her for that."
4,Resolving Science and Genesis,"I read this book after I realized that the Young Earth Creationists' views just didn't hold water. I was looking for a way to reconcile Genesis with science.I think we can go too far in taking Genesis literally and maybe the author does. But, this book is a giant leap forward for people like me who suddenly discover their 6-day creation view just doesn't make sense in light of current scientific understanding. I also found it reassuring to know the theories being presented are not new, but are hundreds of years old. So, it's not as though this theory was concocted as a reaction to recent scientific discoveries."
5,"A ""must read"" for all Bible Believing Christians.","Dick Fischer has approached this book with a lot of integrity. Truth is truth. I am a Bible Believing ""Born Again"" Christian who loves truth. This book presents the truths about our origins from the viewpoint of the scientific community and also integrates these truths with the truth of the Bible (Old Testament and New Testament). Centuries ago well-intentioned believers insisted that the earth was the centre of the universe, that the earth was flat, etc. They used the Bible to support these beliefs. If we stick our heads in the sand and deny very obvious truths we put stumbling blocks in the way of seekers. If people can't trust us on matters proven by archeology, carbon-dating, fossil records, etc. Then why should they be convinced that they can trust us on the more important matters of redemption, salvation, Jesus being the Son of God, etc.Read this book ! It will increase your faith."
3,An ok finish to a great series,I am sad the series is over but I am also happy. I am sad becouse I want to know what happens to the family in the future. I am happy it's over becouse by then end I was tired of reading the books they started to drag on. In the final book Carter Kent sets out across america in search of himself and riche's and gets in some bad sistuations.. Will Kent becomes a doctor. Eleanor Kent marries a Jewish actor. They end up in the middle of the Johnstown flood and it changes there lives forever. The book draged on I found the charactors to be boring in this on and I ahd no interest in them. I liekd the Johnston flood and Eleanor's charactor the best. Overall it was ok it wasent the worse of the series and it had good parts I just found it draged on.
2,The Kent Family Chronicles,"I ordered and received all but one in the series, each book arrived in good time and excellent condition. My experiences have only been positive so far with the Amazon network. I have not had time to read books, but as they are big sellers in the USA I don't feel that's required.Looks like I have to rate books unread, to review."
2,Poorly directed,"The acting is bad, but it's not so much the actors' fault as the director's. They are all acting badly in the same way. The scene is forced on them. They likely have been told to act a certain way without enough to work from, to make it real."
4,One of Costner's First Good Films,"Roger Donaldson's 1987 film regarding the intrigues of the Department of Defense and the Pentagon starring Kevin Costner, Sean Young, and Gene Hackman.Costner is a navy officer and C.I.A. operative who starts having a risky relationship with the mistress (Sean Young) of the Secretary of Defense (Gene Hackman.) When the Secretary of Defense accidentally kills her, Costner is made a scape goat to cover up the potential scandal: he's accused of being a KGB mole. The story then becomes a cat-and-mouse game between the U.S. Government and Costner on the run.This is certainly one of Costner's better movies and the film carries the suspense quite well. Costner's limited acting talents are also complemented by those of Gene Hackman. This is a better movie to rent as it counts on mystery to carry the suspense which is resolved at the end of the film."
4,MOSTLY INTERESTING,"Good beginning, interesting plot, but the interest dried up a bit towards the end. Overall I would recommend this movie. It was nice to see such an innocent movie for a change with realistic everyday characters."
3,Great Lollygagging Convienence Store Songs,"I agree with the previous review: some of the songs on this disc are good, others bad. There *are* some good songs--to wit, Yuming's ""Saigo no Uso"", ""Hana"", ""Banzai ~ .."" and others.If you've ever heard the Japanese CDs MAX collections, you'll probably like this. Many of the songs you'd hear watching a Japanese tv drama or if you were lollygagging through manga or magazines at a Japanese convienence (konbini) store.Sometimes it's hard to come by Japanese pop--this is a good way to catch up."
4,This CD is an excellent variety pack of great import music.,"This CD will entertain lovers of all genres Japanese or not. Most of the songs are pretty good however some are slighty long and/or are a little annoying on the first attempt to listen. Although not quite the best music from Japan, (recent neither) it still boasts a great selection of great music."
4,"Great product, but no heaters",These were just like the ones I used to get in the Army. I like having them around for going on hikes or keeping them in my emergency winter car kit. The only reason I didn't give them five stars was because they didn't come with heaters.
2,A 2 Album Compilation,"The only albums this draws from are ""Uncle Jam Wants You"" and ""The Electric Spanking"". There are better compilations of the later Funkadelic years (post-Westbound, 1976-1981). And WHY is Bootsy's photo on a Funkadelic compilation? That is a dead giveaway that this was put together for those who don't know the difference between Parliament and Funkadelic, Parlet from the Brides, the Horny Horns from the Sweat Band. Admittedly, there was a lot of overlap, but put a photo of Garry in a diaper or George by himself if this cd is to be truly representative of Funkadelic. Peace."
5,Totally Great Royal Diary,I think this was a great diary. It really makes you feel like you're right there with Jahanara. Everything is well-decribed. I loved this book because it was so interesting.
2,just another diary,"well... I considered it pretty boring. All this veil and covering stuff and jewels thing is repetitive, every 5 pages are the same. the story never changes. it is like a cycle. veil-religion-jewels, veil-religion-jewels , veil-religion-jewels ..."
2,just another diary,"well... I considered it pretty boring. All this veil and covering stuff and jewels thing is repetitive, every 5 pages are the same. the story never changes. it is like a cycle. veil-religion-jewels, veil-religion-jewels , veil-religion-jewels ... anyway, i better shut up with this book, ""Isabella, Jewel of Castilla"", THAT is boring. i fell asleep reading it twice."
3,Bothered by some of the errors in the book.,"It was a good read, but the author didn't check his facts when he started talking about other racing series such as CART and IRL. That there were errors in these areas made me question some of his other things he talked about. I liked the book, but with reservations."
1,Lasted less than a year.,This microwave was bought less than a year ago and it stopped working yesterday. It just stopped. We have never been real impressed by this item since we purchased it.
4,So what?,"Bill Readings makes an interesting analysis about the modern university, the ""university of excellence"", which focus more on administration than other areas. However, the book doesn't talk about the role of searching the truth in the University. That was so related to the first universities of the history that I think there is still a lot of space to discuss and talk. I think the problem of the university goes beyond the administrative procedures. What is the goal of researching"
3,Glue showing,"It is really cute, but all around the ears there is glue showing. It is quite thick and cannot be removed. I would return it, but I do not want to go through the hassle."
2,Very Low Quality!,"I got this as a gift for a friend. mine does sing and dance, But Looks like crap to be honest. The fur is glued on very poorly. There are sharp pieces of dried glue sticking out all over around the eyes, mouth and ears. You can barely see one of the eyes casue the fur was pretty much glued on on top of it, insted beside of it. Since christmas is tomorrow i had no time to find a replacement. I repaired it the best i could. I remember see these in the mall years ago and they were awesome, what happened???"
3,color not as it looks,I am happy with the product but I thought the color was bright pink. It is definitely more red than it looks.
5,Micheal Henderson is exceptional,I love Michael Henderson! His voice is purrrrfect in this album. His redention of Ask the Lonely and Reach out for me are excellent. Your my choice is also good. THIS ALBUM IS FUNKY AND FUN!
4,"Nice look, about the size of a tea cup.","The title says it. They are clear glass with a stainless steel saucer, so they really show off the beverage. They are about the size of a fancy tea cup, so not really appropriate for people who like big mugs of drip. It's also bigger than the demitasse espresso shot cups. It's about right for a cup of tea or for French press coffee.They've been pretty durable, but I have not abused them. I hand wash, but the glass is pretty durable. I'd pay attention to not scratching the saucers. No problem yet, but scratches would show up pretty clearly if it were to happen. I'm guessing they'd scratch if I left them on the bottom of a sink full of knives, forks and other dishes."
2,The Worst Garth CD Yet,"In my opinion, ""Sevens"" is Garth's worst CD yet, a real shame considering all of the hubbub he created in Nashville trying to get it released. This CD lacks the powerful songs on his earlier releases, like ""If Tomorrow Never Comes"", ""What She's Doing Now"" or ""Learning To Live Again"". At the same time, it also lacks the upbeat crowd pleasers like ""Papa Loved Mama"", ""Rodeo"" or ""Two of a Kind (Working on a Full House)"". For the most part, I found the CD decidedly UN-country, another example of Garth's selling out the gods of pop music."
1,Alabama Is Right!,"Please see review from Alabama below (next page). He's dead on. I followed the advise and crushed this cd to pieces and put it in my meat grinder. If an advanced civilization unearthed our civilization, I wouldn't want Sevens to represent our musical ability or tastes."
5,video,i have been into Jane's workout since I was young and today I am 70. Since she is close to my age her videos segue to fit my age as well
5,Easy to use,"This is a good product, Jane is easy to exercise with, and easy to follow. I use it nearly every day."
5,love this dvd!,"I started working out with Jane in my 20's and now I'm in my late 50's and just purchased her most recent exercise video -- this one. True to form, it's great. I'm no longer in the shape I was as a younger woman due to a few minor health problems that make movement more challenging. However, this workout is at a great pace and gives you lots of choices. I love you Jane!"
3,Jane Fonda Firm and Burn,"I received this DVD quickly, but I'm not particularly impressed with the DVD. I'm disappointed in the music selection. It's more like elevator music and not songs you've ever heard before. Workout is okay."
1,Why Support This Anti American?,She went to Vietnam during the war and encouraged the enemy causing death and further harm to American POWs. She doesn't deserve our support!
3,good video,This is a little too impact for me but Jane does make it interesting to follow along. Maybe I'll use it again in 10 years.
5,Solved my problem - Easy install - Amazon had best price,Apparently the Denso brand O2/AF sensor is the best replacement for Subarus. Amazon price was below all the auto parts retailers. The installation was straightforward and easy. My check engine light is now off and I'm getting better gas mileage.
4,Getting Stranger,"I love this show, but I'm noticing that its getting as perverted as Family Guy. But I still like the episodes and I can watch them over and over."
5,Fly Spelling,I bought this for my 8 yr. old niece. She loves it. She puts her spelling list in from school every week and plays all the games using those words. She and her parents think it is very entertaining and helpful. She practices her spelling without becoming bored.
5,Impressive,"I purchased this to play with both the wide angle capabilities and the fish-eye views this creates with my K10D. The pictures thus far (roughly 100-120) have shown excellent quality. The types of pictures I've been able to take by purchasing this have impressed me!The only issue I have seen is the images are dark when the sun is in the picture - which is easy to do when the sun is high in the sky. At 180 degrees of view, it captures a lot. Like with anything, one simply needs to check the shot before taking the picture and use the right lens for the situation."
2,Not my kind of book,"I had to read this book for an English class, and needless to say no one liked it, students or the professor. Most of the class did not like it due to the writing style. The professor could not figure out what to even talk about with this book, part from discussing the writing style and what we did and did not like about it. It is not a bad book, just not what was expected."
4,durable but be careful,"durable product but be careful, sliding credit cards in and out of the clip (or driver's licenses for that matter) will begin to wear down your cards front and back. i have used this money clip for 3+ years now and will never go back to a wallet"
4,Good,"My son was very excited to see this speedometer when it showed up. Unfortunately, I broke the gray part while mounting it on his bike and he was not able to use it. Everything else seems ok, and I looked at the gears and made sure they were lubricated properly before putting it back together. Classic old style look, and worked great when I tested it before trying to mount it."
3,First time installer,"Not impossible, but tough to instal. Looked on YouTube to see how vintage speedometers should be installed. Nice option is that you can install on right or left side of tire. Just switch black cap on drive. A little difficult to fit tire hub back onto fork because drive is thick. Still trying to tweak with washers to stop drive from rubbing spokes. The dial on speedometer adds mileage when turned and my 3 year old added about 120 miles to my daughters speedometer. She wasn't happy. She does enjoy riding faster and further and wants to ride all the time. Good for the money. I suggest taking dial pin out."
1,Cure for my insomnia,"The book is so boring! Sure, we get the annual Jessica/Lila fighting over some guy that neither of knows, and Liz/Todd fighting for the millionth time. You know a SVH book is boring when your more interested in what Enid and Winston are doing! And I'm sorry, but, why do Liz and Jessica think they are above authority? That ski patrol guy should have never let her come along in the helicopter to find Todd. I guess because they are so beautiful, the writer is trying to illustrate that they get whatever they want. Whatever. As for Todd, can he please get a spine and something between his legs? He just takes so much verbal abuse from Liz throughout the entire series. It's annoying. No guy would put up with this."
2,Not worth the price.,"I have never been very good at blow drying, and I still am not very good at it. Not much content, and definitely not worth the price."
3,ok,Not as effective as the yellow ear plugs I have gotten in past...I wonder if there are different grades available.
4,Packaging Opened,These earplugs work GREAT! They seal very well in your ears and do a great job keeping out most noise. The only complaint I would have would be with Amazon being the shipper. The box I received was opened and it was missing 11 pairs of ear plugs.
5,Best ear plug available (IMHO),"I've been using these for over 20 years, and I love them. I work a 12-hour day on a locomotive, and the plugs go in when I report for duty, and they come out 12 hours later. They are comfortable enough to wear all day (or night). In addition, they do the best decible-reducing across the entire range of frequencies that I have ever tried."
1,The Worst Book I've ever read!,As a Celine fan i can honestly say this book was filled with a bunch of lies! All this guy was out for was money so he prints terrible things about Celine. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone! Like some else had said its not worth the paper its printed on. Any Celine fan knows she wouldn't threaten suicide and she does not! I repeat does not have an eating disorder! Its sad that someone has to rip apart someone as honest and caring as Celine Dion! No real fan would even touch this book. I'm sorry i did. Don't waste your money on it!
1,This book was a waste of money and had nothing but insults,"This book had nothing, but lies and insults. The only thing good in this book were the pictures. If you enjoy reading a bunch of lies then this is the book for you. I feel so bad for Celine because she has to put up with this kind of stuff eveyday, but her true fans know that everything in this book is a bunch of lies."
1,Disgrace,"I only read one of the many chapters of this book. I am not even really a Celine Dion fan. I am, however, a Gloria Estefan fan. The author said so many things to make Gloria look bad that I KNOW aren't true. If he can be so wrong about Gloria's relationship with Celine how can he be a reliable source on the other parts of her life? Please don't read this book for if you are looking for the truth."
1,If you see Ian Halperin,Tell him he is a hack. This fair tale of facts has nothing to do with the story. Iam Halperin is an amateur paparazzi desperate for a buck. This book is a waste of your money to support his drinking habbits.
2,I returned this book to the bookstore to get my money back.,"I live in Montreal, so I know the ""real"" stuff about Celine Dion. This book is useless. I was laughing throughout it. Yes, how can they know about what goes on in the hot tub on their honeymoon giving word for word quotes. Proposterous! Incredibly suspicious and I too found the songs had wrong names or dates were wrong. I didn't take this book seriously and would never have this pint-sized little handbook of lies in my library. It just wouldn't fit in with the other reputable books.I returned it because I wouldn't want to contribute to the evils of society. Shame on the author. I do not recommend that anyone buys this book."
5,Great guide,"This book provides meaningful devos to guide your family's celebration of advent. If you've never celebrated before, this book is a great starter."
5,We Light the Candle,"This booklet arrived in great shape, in good timing and has prayers and ideas to use with familyand can be adapted for CCD class and community prayers. I was so happy it arrived at the begining ofAdvent."
5,Damn....,"this album is amazing. In every aspect, it prevails as his greatest recording since The Beatles. He flexs his ballad muscle in this album: Little Willow, Calico Skies, Somedays. These are the gems on this album. His rockish songs like Flaming Pie, Really Love You are bad a-- jams. He can still bring new bands of my day to shame. This albums sound is what caught me. Paul, if your out there, I'd really like to thank you for this album. For showing all of them out there how it's done. You Rock!"
4,Ram on Macca!,"Ok, this one isn't as phenomenal as that classic, but it's pretty darn close: great melodies, superior songwriting, pristine production, to me this harks back to the early days, when the boys would cut loose and the melodies flowed -- think the first solo album, Wildlife, and yes, the hallowed Ram.....Who thought the Macca had it in him, after fine but inconsistent sets throughout the late 80's and early 90's? But for my money this is an overall better album than any released from Press to Play forward. The boy still has it, when he wants it...."
3,This Pie Is Half-Baked,"Not quite the Return To Form we were all promised. Some of the good tracks are surprisingly strong - ""Song We Were Singing"", ""Great Day"", ""Flaming Pie"", and ""The World Tonight"" indicate that Sir Paul still has the knack to craft some quality tunes when he wants to. Too much of ""Flaming Pie"" is unfocused such as the dwalding ""Really Loves You"", the languid ""Heaven On a Sunday"", and most criminally, ""Beautiful Night"" in which we listen to McCartney throw away a quality tune on stupid lyrics and a jokey up-tempo ending. ""Flaming Pie"" demonstrates that McCartney might be recovering some of his better pop sensibilities but that he's still in thrall of his excesses."
1,I was GANKED,This was a terrible movie-the only decent part in it was when the male character was singing-(I don't really believe it was his voice). Katt Williams is one of my favorites but that was an awful part for him.
2,Just stupid! well...its OK,"I hear alot of people saying that this movie is one of those movies like scary movie. That however is a complete load of crap. There is about 5 (if that) funny parts in this whole movie. I have no clue why this movie would be rated R. It shows very little blood/gore and doesn't swear at all. If, for some reason, you find this movie amusing or funny, I recommend ""Terror Toons"". It is another one of those ""so stupid its funny"" movies. But this movie is just plainly stupid. This movie is not worth most people's time or money."
3,good rent,this movie kind of dissopointed me it wasent as good as i thought it would be and coolio only makes two cameo appearences the scenes arent copied from other movies like scary movie although they are based this isnt as good as scary movie and i am a fan of spoofs but this seemed to dissopoint the acting was rubbish the jokes were funny but some were over the top i wached this with my aunt and she thought just the same not worth the money although i reccomend for a rent because ther are some good laughs in it
1,so bad,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I paid 4 dollars for a used copy, and I think I overpaid by about 10 dollars. I feel that the makers of this movie owe me 6 dollars for wasting my time. I will never get those two hours I spent watching this movie back. The acting was terrible, the effects were terrible, the movie was terrible. I usually like stupid teen movies, but this one was too much even for me. It was a waste of time and money. DO NOT buy this movie; if you do, believe me, you will be angry with yourself not only for wasting your time and money, but also for not listening to this review."
4,good,this movie was good and i loved it thank you amazonbut it also was a little broken butlike it still works ..kindaso ya overall it was good and good qualitythanks:]
2,No creativity anymore,"Scream was good, scream 2 was better, scream 3 was very bad, scary movie was hillarious and a great parody, scary movie 2 was a disaster but it seems movie makers lack any creativity. This is another scream parody, LIKE scary movie, but not an part 2 or 3, yet it tells the same story, and is much the same movie as scary movie but much worse. GO SEE SCARY MOVIE"
5,Made before Scary Movie,"This movie was made BEFORE Scary Movie, so everybody who claims it's just a rip-off of that doesn't know what they're talking about. Scary Movie just happened to get released first.It's a great movie worth watching. There are heaps & heaps of jokes all the way through and it is quite original.If you're a fan of parodies, then this is definately worth a go.*MADE BEFORE SCARY MOVIE*"
3,Helpful for Beginners,"The book is well organized and written clearly, however, I was hoping to find a little more in-depth information for a more advanced user.This book will really help you if you are a Beginning or early Intermediate user of Captivate."
1,Deadwood sound track,This CD SUCKS!!!!! When I watched the series I totally enjoyed the music...when I heard the sound track I wished I had not wasted my money!!!!! There are clips of dialog from the show at the beginning of each track and I for one do not want to hear parts of a script if I and not watching a show.
3,"some hits, some misses","Joyce has a signature style of playing and singing, covering the range from introspective to euphoric. It's great brazilian jazz but in her own style. Her style and career really didn't get going until 1975 (the 5th track on this album) and her best album and song is 'Feminina' (1980). If you can find that album buy it! The other stuff her is so-so. Some too antiquated, others lacking that sound of hers."
5,This song is awesome!!,"Maria is an awesome song. My flag squad performed a routine to it and we won every competition! This just makes you want to get up and dance, or toss a flag!"
5,My #1 Song,"i am a dancer, and ""maria"" is my #1 song to dance to. it also gets guys throwing $$$'s my way."
5,Light weight and good looks,This watch is one of the most comfortable watches I have ever had. It is very light but very rugged and easy to read dial.
3,"""Extra-long band questionable""","I wish I had seen the other gentlemens remark that the band was not long enough for his wife's wrist. If this band is extra-long, I sure don't want to see a regular sized one. I too will have to purchase a new band or find links to match. Otherwise the watch is fine."
5,great watch!,"This watch is a great watch for nursing! I can get it wet, it has indiglo for night shifts & has an expansion strap which is easy to shove up my arm when I have to wash my hands quickly. Very easy to read"

5,Best Marketing Book ever written!,"They never taught you any of this stuff while you were getting your MBA! This book is a must read, must have for anyone who has anything to do with marketing. The book definitely has a product focus, but many of the ideas can also be used for services. (Selling the Invisible is a good book if you are more into the service area - but definitely read this one as well.) The author does tend to overplay his ideas of the success or failure of a product strictly on branding (without looking at marketplace changes) but if you can overlook his bias - you will get a lot of mileage out of this book."
3,Really good tribute album,"This is probably the most competent tribute album i've seen in a long time. it loses one star because i wish the guy singing was maynardn, and it loses another to the crappy singer that took over for a couple songs near the end. i was really enjoying the first singer, then they bring in the creed sounding guy.well, the acoustic guitars did sound really great, and it is definatly worth the buy to hear that alone. but guys, if you make another one of these (which i hope you do!) stick to the first guy singing."
2,Tool Fan,Some of the songs are really good acoustic Tool covers. Some were really bad. 50/50 at best.
2,Bathroom Singer :),"Good guitar arrengments , new view of the masters pieces of tool but this is the point the singer is for example you go to the bathroom and began to sing and r4ecord it (maybe is how they do it (dont surprices in that)) but when you lisened for a while they dont sound so bad , is like you image yourself singing is a funny felling so make a try if you are not so pure tool fan"
4,This Movie Pretty good,well I always LOVED the child's play series. This one is not like the first 3. This movie has knew characters like TiFF and alot of others. the only same person from the first 3 is ChUcKy!! This movie could have been better if it had Andy back in it OR... told what happened to Andy after he went in the police car in part 3!!! I liked The Child's Play series because in the begining they showed what happened in the last chucky movie. This movie had no follow up on any of the other 3. I was kinda sad that chucky never said anything about Andy or Tyler. This movie was still funny like the others but... a little more comedy in the movie than scary.1 other thing I didn't like about this movie is THE MUSIC. Child's play music was always the best. This was not like music that we all heard in the first 3 movies. Overall this is a very good movie. YOU should see it!!!!
3,"A case of ""We've seen it all before""","When I was told of it's sequel I was stunned! Another Child's play movie? It sounded to good to be true. But when I actually saw the film I laughed. A very good comedy, it is, let down by a very weak plotline...One wonders how it's follow up Seed of Chucky will fair out. Then again, time will tell, we all hope"
2,Went from Horror to comedy but still fails at it,"This movie wasn't scary at all and yes there were a few laughs here and there but overall this movie was not ment to be scary. There is lots of humor in this film unlike the previous CP films.Jennifer tilly is pretty average in this film, Chucky is the man..I guess?...And this movie wasn't all that funny either with a lame ass ending to now is SEED of CHUCKY.Over all this movie could have bin better but well...Not....I give this 2 out 5Then again I can't force you to not watch it but I'm warning you.....this film is pretty...well......StupidLates"
1,Not fond of it,"I watched this for John Ritter, and while he did not disappoint I possibly won't watch it again unless I were making fun of it!"
3,JENNIFER TILLY RULES,"Who can beat Ms. Tilly... She is just great in this hilarious Chucky sequal.I think the teenage subplot detracted from the picture though. John Ritter, in my opinion, was not up to par here."
2,This One Is NOT Hardcore Horror,"Chucky should never be comedy. The jokes aren't funny, and I don't even know if SEED OF CHUCKY is any good because that's what it's turned into already...comedy. I thought that would be cool, but now it's all just gone silly. I used to enjoy this, but I've come to the conclusion that Chucky movies NEED to be horror in order to be good, but....it's changed over the past few years."
3,The best chucky movie in the series,"Chucky comes back to life (as always), but this time he has a female play mate. This movie would seem more like a black comedy than a horror movie, but thats nothing bad. Plenty of scares and entertainment which wont let down for a second. Although, still left open for another sequel."
1,A VERY BAD MOVIE!!!,"This is the worst child's play movie ever. It wasn't the least bit scary... But there were a couple of funny parts, like when the dolls were smoking. The writing was very bad. When the dolls were making out, I was about to puke. I would avoid this movie at all costs."
1,"God, This is a colossal bore.","Recycled riffs, poorly written lyrics. A completely unoriginal waste of aluminum."
5,Excellent! Worth the Investment!,"I added 2 of these units to my wireless network. One for my Access point and one for my neighbor behind me. He is acting as a repeater off of my network and he's approx 400 feet away! We are getting pings back and forth anywhere between 2ms to 5ms and the connection has been solid for a few weeks! I don't even have either of these in a window. Mine is behind my TV on the outside wall facing him, and his is at the opposite side of the house from me! So it's traveling through his entire structure. We were able to get connections without the WSB24 but both units were in the window and his unit was in the window on the wall closet to my house. Any movement from this and it lost signal. If you are doing anything like this buy it!!"
1,Linksys Wireless Signal Booster Doesn't Work,"My linksys wireless signal booster simply does not work. When I tested it (repeatedly) I observed 18 - 20% signal strength without the unit and a range of 17-24% at the same test point using the same test instrument with the unit installed and powered-up. These results cannot be said to be any change at all from a scientifically sound standpoint. I will be returning my unit ASAP. I am a proponent of linksys products despite their ""pricyness"" but this unit simply does not work. The only pro I can relay is that it is very simple to uninstall for return to the place of purchase.I did see where someone said the unit was pulled from the market on June 18. The product is not listed on linksys.com."
4,"Just like it says, it boosts your signal","You should note that nowhere in the documentation does it say HOW MUCH it boosts your signal. It just boosts it.Well, I agree, it boosted my signal.My problem was that I live in an old building with dense walls (and maybe lead paint), so two rooms away from the router I was only getting about 15-25% signal. After I installed the booster (very easy), I'm getting 70% signal.If you just have one access point, this is the best way to increase your signal."
3,Product works but beware...,"I bought this before reading these reviews. Hopefully this will save someone else some grief. This product was designed for the original Linksys BEFW11S4 router. Starting with the V3 model they changed the antennas. I have a V3 and the antennas will not fit on the WSB24 signal booster. I know there is now a V4 of the router out, but I don't know if the antennas have changed. Look at the underside of the router where the serial number is. Nearby is the model number that includes the version.I found a company that makes replacement antennas for Linksys routers, and bought a pair that work with the WSB24. I gave this product 3 stars because it is not being marketed properly. There needs to be a warning that this product does not work out of the box with all models of the BEFW11S4."
3,What do you expect?,"It's less than a buck for a jolly roger flag. What do you expect? It's cheap, you can see through it. I think it's worth it."
3,"OK, but not great","Receipes are a little to complicated. Long lists of ingredients makes it hard to shop, and hard to cookup up a quick meal. Try the WTW ""Cooking For 2"" or ""Slow Cooker"" instead."
4,simply delicious:245 No-Fuss Recipes--Al 8 points or less,I like this book. I just wish it had more pictures. It is easier for me to make something that I can see a pictures of first.
2,Don't look like an idiot.,"As an experienced clinician I was appalled to see a Death Note written by a medical student using the guide in this book. He titled it ""Celestial Dischage""-- just as it is noted in the book. It was his first time, and he thought that was acceptable to put in a patient's chart.If you expect to use a reference when you are either inexperienced, 3/4 brain dead after call, or both, don't risk your professional reputation on ""cute."""
3,"Good, but some bad errors","On page 17, the two formulas for creatinine clearance are wrong. Has anyone else noticed this? Also, on page 18, the reticulocyte index formula isn't accurate because it doesn't factor in the maturation factor. Other than that, this is a very useful book."
5,Great book for medical students and interns!,"This is a great pocket-sized resource packed full of necessary information for the wards...how to write orders, the meaning of abnormal labs, critical care, interpreting EKGs--basically all the essentials of internship are provided in a concise format with references; in an easily readable form written in a very accessible style. Excellent for both the student and the student preparing for internship!"
5,Yes! It WORKS for 4GB SDHC AND Normal 4GB SD !!!!,"I bought another brand sku 207655871 8GB SD / SDHC / MMC Memory Card Reader to USB 2.0 Adapter, Smoke by Eforcity - AVOID IT, it doesn't WORK with 4GB SDHC or 4GB SD. But the MicroMate worked with BOTH!!! THUMBS UP!"
2,STINKY ROUGH SOAP,"I fell into the hype and ordered a bar, after a few showers I threw it away. It made no difference in my skin, rather than smelling like rotten eggs. The soap actually dries you out a bit. I would only recommend this if your dermatologist says you need it. Otherwise dont fall into the hype."
3,Ok.,"This is a nice soap, it doesn't dry your skin, but it is not as strong in the sulfur as prescription version. I never break out when I use the prescription version."
4,Solid Album From Start To Finish,"This album is incredibly underrated. This is yet another Queensrche concept album, but the songs are good enough to stand alone. I dig all the songs, and actually find myself humming them often. These songs are very catchy and feature good riffs. Geoff Tate does yet another great job at vocals! These are some of the better songs on the album: ""Sign Of The Times"", ""Saved"", ""The Voice Inside"", ""Hero"", ""Hit The Black"" & ""sp00L""I recommend this album to just about anyone. This is a good hard rockin' album!"
3,Deffinately not there best,"This CD just didn't impress me the way that ""..Mindcrime"" ""Empire"" or ""Promised Land"" did. While, musically this is a good CD, Queensryche has had better stuff.Couple of standout songs (The Voice Inside and Some People Fly) but on the whole, just OK."
3,"Solid compared to today's music, not solid for Queensryche.","This is a good album compared to the talentless music being released in the late 90's, but from the band who wrote Operation:Mindcrime(the best album ever), Rage for Order, and Empire it falls short. If you like thought provoking progressive metal, grab one of the three I just named, otherwise, if you like more mainstream music of today, this one will work for you. There are a few songs like ""Reach"", ""sp00L"", and ""The Voice Inside"" which do make this album worth having. Or do yourself a favor and get them all!"
1,This album deserves a negative rating.,"This album demonstrates just how far Queensryche have fallen. After releasing simply awe inspiring works like Rage for Order and Operation:Mindcrime, the band made a MAJOR mistake by releasing this crud.Apparently they decided, like too many of the great bands of the 80's, to turn their back on the fans that made them great to begin with, and change sounds to appeal to a different generation. The younger generation wouldn't bother listening to it, because they were already stereotyped as an ""80's band.""The net result is a horrible album, which nobody likes."
4,ehhhhh it coulda been worse,This is my least favorite queensryche album and with four stars that says something. The first time I heard it I hated it and couldn't believe it was queensryche. So I listened a few more times. It grew on me. I like it. The lyics are upbeat and thoughtful. The quitar work is nice and the rythm section is tight as always. If you are a queensryche fan ignoire the bad reviews and buy this. It will grow on you. If you are new to queensryche buy mindcrime or empire or any of their other albums first
3,Good sound,"good old hip hop cd, I loved it, but after this many years it has just simply grown out of date , bottom line."
4,"Boogie Monsters cut to the quick with ""God Sound""","Strictly east coast, rootsy hip-hop...chock full of wisdom, social commentary and spiritual nourishment for the soul. Musically sparse but very tasteful...A solid effort...Parents should buy this for their hip-hop loving teenagers...positive and clean!"
2,sophomore jinx indeed..,"--i agree with the other guy- that every several months,i pop in this cd to let it grow on me, but it just won't happen!for me, stand outs are AND THEN WHAT?, SAW WHAT, BODYA,and THE LUNCHROOM TABLE. there is maybe 1 or 2 morethat i used to hum to, but i can't recall..BUT i don't agree with the other guy about that 1st album.that S#!T was/is on my top 5 since i copped it in the 90s.so, this GOD SOUND cd is aiight, but a let-down compared toTHE UNDERWATER ALBUM: RIDERS OF THE STORM.i think i'll write a reveiw on that now!--"
5,My beautiful scent of years...,"Coco Mademoiselle by Chanel for Women 3.4 oz Eau de Toilette SprayI have worn this scent for years. By mistake I purchased the EDT and normally wear the Parfum, but the scent is glorious for all seasons. I believe the vendor had an image of the EAU DE PARFUM instead of the Eau de Toilette which is what I received. I have never felt the need to replace what works and was delighted to find it on Amazon, my virtual life's shopping experience."
2,"Well, expensive.....","This is a good album, but it isn't worth all the extra money. The main difference is the live version ""Down"", which isn't worth all that money. Just buy the regular version."
2,More money than what its worth,"This version of Down was recorded at the House of Blues in Las Vegas just before the release of No. 4. It is not bad, however you can purchase the track on the Down EP. This entire CD spells out hard hits, from Down to Atlanta! Down is a banging heavy guitar track. Heaven and Hot Rods is vintage STP, with a solid drum / guitar combination with singer Scott's beauty of his voice. Sour Girl is a standout song on this CD, it is a very soft song built around the lyrics and it tells a story of love and leaving. Church on Tuesday is a solid track focusing around Scott's vocals and lyrics accompanied with a big guitar. No Way Out is always a fun song, it's a song you sing when you have someone that you do not like and they have trapped themselves. Sex and Violence is another fast paced alternative rock marvel, with brief pauses between guitar riffs to catch your breath."
4,A Warm Read for a Cold day,"Great easy reading, wonderful book to read in February, makes you wishing for summer, nice refreshing break with interesting characters, easy to loose yourself in this story..."
1,BEWARE--Valve is NOT included,"I thought I was getting a great deal when I purchased this, but watch out. I am not an expert on plumbing or fixtures, and though my husband is (in know-how, not by trade), he still was confused by the intentionally vague description which dow not disclose that this does not include the valve, which most sets like this do include. We think the valve needed (which we found out AFTER we had already paid for and received this item) is actually discontinued as we can't find it ANYWHERE. Make sure you have, or can find the Danze valve D112000T or D115000T BEFORE you buy this. AND include however muuch you need to spend on the valve WHITH the cost of this item, because most any other set like this on the market WILL include the valve, and you can get deals on them for as low as $89... we're not getting any deal now unless we can find the right valve for $20 or less! Rating: F-"
4,a beauty,"I installed this over my favorite reading chair for a rustic look. Though I love this lamp, it was way overpriced! I would recommend Angelo Lighting wall lanterns, as they are of equal quality yet 1/5 the price of Progress! AND Angelo lights usually come WITH a bulb, so that's extra savings!"
4,Lasts longer than other toys....,"My corgi loves tearing toys apart, ripping out all fluff, and chewing up squeakers. He is on his second Ultimate Rumble Ring, and loves these toys! The first one lasted a couple of months before being completely destroyed, the second is around a month old and he just managed to tear it open.The weakness is the point where the outer seam is joined. My dog works on this point until he rips through, and then manages to tear through the seams underneath.For dogs who are really tough on their toys, this won't last forever, but it will certainly last longer than any other plush dog toy I've found."
2,My dog founds it's weakness.....,"I have a 18 month old Husky, and he typically destroys all his stuffed toys within hours. I thought that this would outlast the others by months, based on other reader reviews. Unfortunately, he found the ring toy's weakness... the stitching! He managed to pull apart the stitching on one side and ripped out all the cotton within 2 hour of playing with it. I still have yet to find a toy that he can not break through. He does still like to play with it even though it is no longer stuffed."
2,Demolished in a few days,"So my dog is a medium size breed, only about 50 lbs. and he loves to destroy his toys. So far he has demolished triple braided ropes, tennis balls, plastic toys and even one of his harnesses. The only toy that he hasn't destroyed is his KONG ball. Well we got this toy for Christmas, thinking maybe he wouldn't be so quick to tear it up. He loved it, but the 9 tough rating was not enough, he destroyed the toy in 3 days! He chewed the black siding off, and ripped out the stuffing and squeakers. Not that he didn't love the toy and enjoyed tearing it up, I just wish it would have lasted a little longer! (That's the only reason I rated it so low) It's a great toy and he loved it, but if your dog is a toy destroyer I wouldn't recommend this one."
5,"Dog loves it, but we need a 10 on the Tuffy scale","30 lb. Beagle loves to chew and play with this, but he can still unstuff it in 10-15 minutes of play, so we will try the ""10"" next. He is an aggressive chewer."
1,Shredded and torn to bits on 1st day,"My Golden Retriever destroyed this toy on Christmas. Tore up one quarter of it, pulled out the stuffing and a squeaker in 5 minutes. Went back and got the other side the next day. Hate paying good money for ""tuff"" toys I know he will destroy, but how much rubberized/kong extreme toys can a dog chew on? So I keep trying these canvas ""Ultimate"" tough toys hoping one will finally be a challenge that lasts longer than minutes. Not this one!"
2,"Not ""tuff"" enough","I was (and still am) in search of toys that my dog can't destroy in one sitting. He is pretty determined to de-squeak and unstuff anything he's given and he was able to do it with this toy in less than an hour. The standard fleece stuffed toys last 20 minutes, tops, so this did last longer but costs too much for the small amount of time he had it for. He's still playing with the ""carcus"" but it won't last long. This toy might be fine for some dogs but was not strong enough for my American Bulldog/Hound mix. So far all we've found that works is the Nylabone line of chew toys, but I was hoping to give him something else to play with that wasn't as hard."
1,Software Uninstall Requires Professional Help!,"If for any reason the user would like to uninstall the admin and driver software (Install Software from product CD) that which supports Linksys G series products, it would be beyond a simple wizard uninstall. That is, in some cases, the user may require skills editing the Windows Registry (it's very dangerous to delete Windows registry keys and values)."
5,Worked Great with W2K - easy install,"Install in minutes. Software works well with the wireless card. There is not much printed user guide- this may be a problem for some users. But, the user guide is available in the CD. Honestly, I didn't even use the user guide at all.3 steps installation processes: 1. install drivers and utilities. 2. install wireless card. 3. configure wireless network. Done."
1,MY ANTENNA FELL OFF!,"This product has the worst antenna connection I have ever seen. Just look at the reviews, many claim their antenna fell off and that they had to return it. Mine fell off, but I grabbed a pair of pliars and squeezed the little connector back into the card, then screwed the antenna back on. I hope it holds, cause if it falls off again, you have to take the whole card out to fix it and that is such a pain."
2,Not working so good for me.,"I just installed this card in my pc. It's a PIII 1 gig with 256 megs of ram. I have it set up to dual boot with win 2k pro and win 98 SE.I first tried to set it up under win 2k. It recognizes the card fine, and says it is working properly. However, the linksys utility will not run for some reason, so I cannot configure it for my network. The utility does not come up when I boot, and when I try to manually run it, I get nothing (no error messages or anything) it just won't run.Then I booted it up with win 98 and installed it, and everything seems to work fine. This is on the same pc with the same hardware configuration."
1,randomly drops connection.,"On the plus side, this PCI adapter installs like a charm. Put it in, everything gets recognized without a hitch. Unfortunately, after it connects, it drops the wireless connection for no reason at least once an hour. The signal is strong (3 or 4 out of 5 bars strong) when it is connected, then it drops, then reconnects about 10 seconds later. I have not been able to figure out the problem. I have heard others have the same problem, so I will look for something else that doesn't suck as much."
3,Not adaptable for slim cases?,I bought the adapter for use with my new Dell Inspiron 530S (slim line)computer. It would not fit into the slot provided. I returned it to Amazon and bought one from Dell that was designed to fit either a standard slot or the slim one. I guess that the whole unit was bigger and could not be sent with two different plates to fit either slot.
3,There are cheaper alternatives.,I got two adapters and a router for $60. Good luck trying to find that deal again.
5,WIRELESS,I AM VERY SASTISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASE. WE HAVE A SHOP BEHIND OUR HOME AND TWO INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. WITH THIS ADAPTER ALL OUR COMPUTERS ARE NOW ON ONE PROVIDER. IT WORKS REALLY WELL AND SO FAR NO PROBLEMS. NOW THERE IS ONE PROVIDER AND ONE BILL.
1,Horrible.,"I should have known better. After having problems with the Linksys wireless G router for over a year, I was stupid enough to purchase another Linksys product... the Wireless-G PCI adapter. Why did I do this? Because it was cheaper than the other routers. Why did I take it back to the store two weeks later? Because it was a piece of junk that never worked right.We have a desktop computer in the same room as a laptop computer. The laptop connected to our wireless network just fine, and it reliably maintained the connection all day long. The desktop with the brand new Linksys PCI card connected to the network sporadically at best, and sometimes couldn't even detect the network. There were occasionas that went on literally for hours when we couldn't connect to the internet for more than a few seconds at a time. Save your time and your money and invest in one of the many better options that are available. And avoid Linksys like the plague."
2,"If you wish to use WPA Encryption, this is not your product!","I bought this thinking no problem with current Wi-Fi technology. My Linksys WRT54G Router supports WPA-SPK; as is how I set-up my home network. Our Dell laptops run WPA-PSK encryption with no problem, easy set-up. When trying to bring our desktops into the network, we discovered THIS CARD DOES NOT SUPPORT WPA ENCRYPTION WITHOUT A THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE (at your cost). Buy the ""2Wire"" 802.11G adapter, either USB or PCI. It works right out of the box.J MattaVernon Hills, IL"
5,Great product,"I haven't had this product long but, it works great with my Linksys router. Easy to install with the CD."
3,works great unless you're running Windows 7 64 bit,driver situation is a mess for Win 7 64. Avoid this card if you want to run it with this operating system
3,Works great,I will start off with saying that this unit works great but as with any of these wireless adapters there will be range limitations so keep that in mind about 100 feet or so
4,Linksys WMP54G Wireless PCI adapter,This card is very easy to install. It has great signal strength and is very easy to configure.
4,Inspiring,The story told made real the struggle of those coming to California with a dream and how that dream was or was not realized. It was very inspiring and makes the reader realize how fortunate we are to be who we are and appreciate where we came from. I think it should be required reading for Jr. High or High School students to motivate the work ethic.
1,"Poorly written stories masquerading as ""folktales""!","Jeesh! These are incredibly banal and bland retellings of a mismash of stories, some based in folklore and some, amazingly, inane kiddy campfire fare. The editors have the gall to include a tale called ""The Girl and the Anorak,"" an even-sillier-the-usual rendition of that tired old chestnut about the git who picks up a female hitchhiker, loans her his anorak (jacket/sweater/raincoat/windbreaker), goes looking for it later and discovers that the girl was actually a GHOST KILLED IN A ROAD ACCIDENT and his anorak (jacket/sweater/raincoat/windbreaker) is HANGING ON HER TOMBSTONE.Yawn.Don't waste your money."
5,Swan Song Phenomenon,"All I have to say is Listen To Track #1, ""Insanity"". That song alone STILL gives me the chills when I hear it. It's so evil sounding....And The Video.....Lots of great songs on here. Still proves to the listener that Danny Elfman is in fact a musical genius. He's written so many scores for movies as well. Something else to check out is Danny Elfman's Solo Effort entitled ""Music For A Darkened Theatre:Volume One"" which is a collection of all of Danny Elfman's movie score material. Check out yet another Boingo remake ""I Am The Walrus"" which is included on this SWAN SONG album by Oingo Boingo."
4,Even better than the first book,"I really liked Circle of the Moon. I liked it better than the book that preceded it, in which we first meet the Sisters of the Raven. That is, in part, because the ending was happier. I can't recall the last time I read a Hambly novel that had an upbeat ending.I liked what Hambly's done with Foxfire Girl, in particular. There were also two points in the story where I thought, 'yes, of course', as pieces I hadn't connected before slid into place, a thing few authors can manage. It was a FUN book to read.It was not perfect. Raeshaldis takes leave of her senses in service of the plot, and Oryn, who's no fool, displays a true inability to manage politics. I guess he didn't learn anything from the events of the first book."
5,Best Guide,We went all over Paris using this mapguide. It was the best map for a large city that I ever used. It was our first ime to Paris and I was very comfortable getting around. I would highly recommend the Paris mapguide. We also used the London mapguide also and were just as pleased.
5,The Paris Magquide,"I needed to re-order this wonderful little mapbook, because my old one was so scribbled up in all the margins, streets circled, etc. It is the best. It is thin enough to fit into your purse or pack without adding any extra weight. It surpasses the Streetwise map, as it covers every little street and alley, that the Streetwise does not.I also saw on Amazon that the prices being asked were ridiculously high. I do not understand that. I knew I did not pay more than $8 for it, so I re-ordered 'thru the back door' by going into my previously purchased list. This guide retails for $10.00 so don;t pay more than that for it!!"
1,Bad quality,"I received this cable and from day 1 it didn't work. I bought this to run from my router to my DirecTv DVR box and it never worked. It also crashed my router a few times. I also tried to use this cable for my xBox 360 and Desktop CPU, both were unsuccessful."
4,ALMOST perfect replacement pen ...,"I bought this pen as a replacement for the original one that came with my Toshiba Portege. It works GREAT!! I am, however, having one problem with it. I tend to put things away when I'm finished with them. When I put this pen away, I can't get it back out! It must be a little short for my tablet. Once the pen is in the slot, it is incredibly difficult to remove. My fault - I think I must have misread an earlier post."
5,Arcitec Shaver,"Excellent shaving system, incredibly flexible shaver head allows for easy shaving over all the contours of your face and neck. The shaver is easy to clean, simply rinse under water, and even comes with a cleaning and recharging system."
2,Most disappointing Norelco yet.,"I've used Norelco products for 30 years and this is the only one that has ever disappointed me. It creates skin burn and takes forever to actually shave your beard and I don't even have a tough beard. After 6 months, the cleaning stand system quit working.I pulled out my old Norelco Cool Skin 7775X, recharged it and was surprised at how much better of a shave I got with the old razor. Now I need to find a replacement head for the old one and trash the Arcitec.Norelco makes great products, this is the exception that proves the rule."
1,Concept of the shaver head sounds and looks better than it Performs,The idea of the floating shaving head and each rotary blade having it's own pivoting point to contour to your face sounds great but the fact isThis razor is terrible. It did not shave nearly as close as my previous norelco shaver. This arcitec caused more irritation and razor burn than any other razor I have used including cheapo disposable single blade razors. Reason being is I found that I would have continuously pass over the same area over and over and couldn't get the hair Shaved especially on my neck. It literally took about 15 minutes to obtain an acceptable shave. Note that I do have sensitive skin and a tough beard. Anyway I returned the razor and purchased norelco 8260 with the jet cleaning system and I have to say the shave with it is amazing. I got a shave that is as close as a blade with very little irritation in about 5 minutes. Save yourself (...) buy the 8260CC
3,"okay, but let's go easy on the hyperboles","B&S obviously fill a niche, and I'm glad they're around, but let's not go overboard. The soft vocals and acoustic guitars combine so pleasingly that they tend to cover up the thinness in both melody and lyrics. ""Don't look back, like Dylan in the movies"" (Don't look back being the title of a Dylan concert movie)is the kind of facile wordplay that passes for genius in a generation that has stopped reading books. A little too fey and twee at times, as well, but don't let me disturb the B&S lovefest going on here!"
2,Donovan does it much much better....,"The 60's was a time for sexual liberation and copious amounts of folk pop. Belle and Sebastian just don't seem to cut it, their only attraction being that they started out as a relatively obscure group, enough for record collectors and indie punters to go gaa gaa over such a contrvied and unoriginal group. Murdoch's vocals are boring and limited, and for an 8 piece, they'd want to be better. dull. flat. lifeless. folk pop with 90's lyrics. just what we need....."
2,extremely perplexing...,"Belle and Sebastian never fail to totally confuse this listener, and this album seems to carry the most obvious examples of their perplexing sound. The good: The melodies are very catchy. The songs are played with admirable restraint, with a clear head for what atmosphere they try to evoke; a wistful, slyly melancholy musical space that soothes the listener, while implanting some solid, hummable melody and subtle instrumental work. ...This music is well-played; the group know their sound and how to use it. But since it has no originality to it, that isn't saying very much, is it?"
2,You're safer than you ever dreamed possible,"I bought this CD because I thought I should get acquainted with the music of B&S. Schwing! The miracle of these guys is that they've managed to convert lithium to audio format. There are no highs. There are no lows. It's all blandly uniform ear-custard. B&S is guaranteed to be comfortable, fuzzy and ultra-familiar. How depressing! For more details and accurate observations, see the review written by Eduardo Alba."
5,Great Screen,An integral part of our master bedroom computer/projector home entertainment system - and it hides behind the curtain when not in use. glides easily and provides a clear bright image.
5,Saved my life,I am a man who doesn't particulary like to read but this book was in my range and it had tons of information that helped me not only change me and how i eat and live life but my kids and friends. I highly recommend this book to anyone.
1,Worst Book Ever,"All of this information is common knowledge and some is quite dated. You can get all of the information provided in this book in a much better format by spending $2.95 on the latest fitness magazine which will actually provide accurate information. I would be willing to guess that the ""Dr."" in this title is not a doctor in nutrition science. A scam!"
1,Are we reading the same book?,"I look at some of these other reviews and laugh. Are we reading the same book?? Saturnian Snake is 700+ pages of dull prose, terrible dialogue, and wooden characters.I agree with all the reviewers that the premise of this book is good. Yes, the history of medicine over the past 35 years is fascinating. The idea of portraying it through the eyes of one man whose career spanned that era is solid. But the author was undecided on whether he wanted to produce an entertaining novel or a dry documentary. He tried to do both, and what he produced is a dull novel. Shorten it by 450 pages and you'd have a great, tight story against the backdrop of a period of incredible change. But as it stands right now, the reader plows through chapter after chapter waiting for something to actually happen. And by the time the changes in the medical field become evident, the reader has fallen asleep and doesn't care about the characters any more."
1,disappointed,"I was so excited to get the Footloose movie as I was wanting my kids to watch it before the new one came out. Got everyone together and put it in and it wouldn't play. Kept giving me an error saying it was the wrong region. I had never even heard of region codes for dvds. I would think that would be something that would be pointed out when purchasing the item. I noticed now that since I complained the region code is on there so if you know about region codes I guess you're in good shape. I've ordered movies before and never had to deal with this problem. When I wanted to return it, of course I had to pay the shipping and handling to send it back, which I didn't do, so now I'm stuck with a movie that can't be watched. Good thing I wasn't out much money. I felt it should have been taken care of considering when I ordered the movie it said nothing about what region it was for. Not giving the movie a bad review just the company it came from!"
2,Footloose - the original,"I made a huge mistake with this purchase. I thought I was getting the new version and paid for express post to make it for a Christmas gift.Shock - horror when I opened the parcel to find the 1984 edition enclosed. Of course the original was a great movie but over 28 years howmany times can you watch the same old stuff. I guess I wasn't as disappointed as much as the receiver. It will be cheaper to buy the newversion locally when it hit the shops, without the postage, so it was another lesson learnt."
2,Let's hear it for the boy! This movie eats dirt!,"This movie absolutely sucks. Yeah, the soundtrack is alright, but other than that this movie bored me out of my mind. If this is supposed to be 'dance' film, I fail to see how it's supposed to be one. There's hardly any dancing in it. The little bit of dancing that is shown isn't even anything spectacular. Toward the end of the movie when everyone is at the prom, these wanksters come out and try to breakdance. No real skills at all. Skip ""Footloose"" at all costs. If you want to see some REAL breakdancing, see ""Breakin'."""
3,"Great nostalgia, BAD DVD","FOOTLOOSE brings back a lot of great memories -- I loved this movie in high school, played the soundtrack a million times, and have wondered for several years why this movie wasn't available on DVD.Now Paramount underwhelms us again with a very disappointing DVD release. While at least we get a widescreen presentation and a 5.1 channel audio mix, that's ALL we get. Period. Were this a [$] budget release, I could understand the lack of extra features, but this is a full-price DVD!At the very least, I would like to have seen the music videos for songs on the soundtrack included as bonus material. An audio commentary from the director/cast would have been great. A behind-the-scenes documentary, interviews with the cast, ANYTHING!!!But we must remember that this comes from Paramount, the studio that doesn't like the DVD format. I suppose we should be grateful to see any Paramount films on DVD at all..."
2,Footloose Deluxe Edition,I remember the movie but on the DVD the picture was distorted. I was disappointed with the quality of the DVD.
3,Footloose,"The movie could be a bit better with language, other than that not a bad show Not recommended for children."
3,love the music,Not as good as the new one. It lacks the color and does not explain why he is so determined to dance
3,Be more Chill... wow,"'Be More Chill' by Ned VIzzini is a book that covers all aspects of growing up. Here's the story: Jeremy Heere is your typical sex-obsessed teenager who is deperate to be cool and impress girls. Nothing seems to work until his friend tells him to get a squip, and with a little bit of help from the voice of Keanu Reeves (there's a perk for the girls!) he scores!Ned Vizzini perfectly captures exactly how it feels to be growing up today, and despite the narrator being a boy, the book appeals to all sexes of all ages and no doubt will remind us all of a situation we've been in.In short: One to readNote: I would only reccomend this book to readers over the age of sixteen, ot younger more mature readers as it has some sexual content"
2,Disappointed,"When I took the book out of the package, I knew I would be disappointed. The book cover was dirty with globs of glue or paste on it, pages were torn, and the call number tag was still on it. I realize the book is used, but really? It couldn't be cleaned up a little bit? I don't think I'll be ordering from this company again."
3,review of be more chill,"Although not a book I would normally read, I found it fairly good. I would recommend it to 16 year olds and over; it is probably most suitable for males. The plot is clever and ends well. Jeremy Heere buys a squip, an electronic device that is swallowed as a pill, hoping that it will help him get a girlfriend and become 'cool'. The book contains too much swearing for my liking, though it is mostly written with stars and there are also some fairly detailed sexual references. I could relate to the struggles Jeremy (main character) experiences when he has to decide whether to follow the squip and become 'cool' or stick with his real friend and follow his own instincts. The advice the squip provides him is useful and successfully increases his popularity, so it's easy to see why he becomes completely reliant on it. However, will the squip always know best?"
4,Great collection of artwork (paintings/pencil work/pen),"Adult color or black & white paintings/pen and ink/pencil pin-ups.The pictures range from very realistic to more obviously drawn pictures. There are at least 50 pictures in the book. The women are just normal girls, or vampires, or mermaids or in bondage, or witches, or demon's girl, or being barbequed. There are numerous instances where Irvin shows the process of creating the picture (and he himself is in some of the photos). A quite good collection of pictures. (4.2)"
4,The Mighty Whispers,"These guys have a ton of hits.Full of power, high energy and soul. Great dance music, even for my two daughters of 2 and 3 1/2 years of age!"
5,First of its kind!,"I think that this book is the first work which offers an accurate analysis of interactivity, and all opportunities created by digital convergence which can be exploited. This book has a dual utility: I think it is the first book which measures the potential for IT convergence (chapter 2) and that describes various digital services which can be broadcast through different systems. It identifies unsolved problems (chapter 3), trying to estimate the economic implications of digital technologies (chapter 4) and giving a definition and a whole analysis of digital interactive television and its positioning along the multimedia value chain. This work interests not only an academic audience but also middle management and executives of media companies which want to understand their new business opportunities (chapter 6) and particularly the repositioning of content provider, the new role of network provider and the ""dictatorship"" risk of service provider."
2,Great Red Squirrel Feeder,"While feeding, the red squirrel, perched conveniently inside the globe, can feed to its heart content. As long as the squirrel is inside the feeder, no bird will approach.I tell my mother-n-law to stop filling the feeder. But she insists, ""the squirrels have to eat as well"".Sigh."
4,Better than I was expecting,"Pretty tasty.I carry this with me to school and mix it with water, yes milk tastes better. Convenient, but it doesn't stand out especially."
2,bad quality,"Got this free with my Toshiba laptop from Circuit City. Wonder why it's free? Because quality sucks. Other people are true, the black isn't BLACK. The color sucks. It's like an old printer. The scanning is okay, it scans. I like the program that comes with it. It copies fine too. But the paper always gets stuck.And, it's hard to find the ink. Went to Best Buy and they didn't have the ink!"
2,Not Very Satisfied,"The best feature of this printer is the ability to produce excellent scans of photos. I am very impressed with the quality of the photos, however, document scanning is less than satisfactory. Also the quality of ink in this printer is less than satisfactory, my black ink appears as brown. The printer cover is very lose. The cover will come off in your hands when you open it."
1,BEAUTIFULLY COLD ELEKTRO,"ALLTHOUGH THIS IS AN OBVIOUS HOMAGE TO VISAGE'S ""FADE TO GREY"" IT IS AN AMAZING SONG NONE THE LESS....A COLD ICY SLICE OF BEAUTIFULLY DARK ELEKTRO...THIS WILL BE THE DANCE HIT OF THE SUMMER....MISS OSBOURNE HAS GROWN UP AN INTO A NOUVEAUX GOTH GODDESS.....I EAGERLY AWAIT THE RELEASE OF THE FULL ALBUM...A HARBINGER OF THINGS TO COME I HOPE.....(AND THE IMPORT VERSION CONTAINS THE GORGEOUS VIDEO!!!)p.s. i actually gave this cd 4 stars....the rating is misprinted!!!!!"
3,A little disapointed,Before I bought this book I read reviews saying that the book came with rings as well. Well mine didn't but I'm not making too big of a deal about it because the book seems great and I will soon buy some rings from someone else. (which will probobly better quality than these anyways)
5,Third time's a charm,"To say this is the worst of the samplers is unfair, simply because it's not the same kind of music. The first two were that energetic, hands-in-the-air ""WOO HOO!"" style trance, this one is the chilled-out, laid-back late night drive home. Sure, the music is more sparse here, but that seems to be the point; any more sounds thrown in would kill the mood. This is a great disc, possibly my favorite since you can just throw on your headphones, lay back on the couch and just groove. Perfect."
4,DISNEY PRINCESS MY FIRST BALLET STUDIO,"I have just bought this toy for my grandaughter's Christmas and am very dismayed at how difficult it is to find the other Princesses. I live in Scotland, United Kingdom and have been told they are not in UK range. If anyone can help I would be over the moon."
4,Cute - but you can't find other Ballerinas!,"My 2 year old daughter was so excited when she received this gift for Christmas. She also received the JoJo's Circus Magic Circus Friends Pack. I was lucky she did, because the characters have magnets in their feet and some of them (Dinky and Goliath) work pretty well with the Ballet Studio. (...)"
2,"Purchase of book ""The Searchers""","I was a bit disappointed when I received the book. I purchased this book as a new hard back book in lieu of buying a used book from an earlier printing. The book is bound with cloth and pasteboard end pieces which is okay, however, there was no dust cover. Even a used book would have had a dust cover. Maybe I am being picky but to me the book binding and all were a little cheesy. I wish now I would have purchased a ""Used Book"" from an earlier printing."
2,Falls Apart,"I like this toy but I do get very tired of having to put it back together. It keeps falling apart. My son is very cautious playing with this but I get so tired of him saying to me ""MAMA it fell apart again."" I think they should rethink the construction of this toy."
3,They love it BUT,"the archway breaks off and wont stay on and the pieces are way too small to have laying around. So if you are into picking up picking up picking up, get it...the faces of my boys are priceless, though, when the show comes on and they are able to play along with the show.:)"
5,Perfect for Media Center,There are not a lot of choices for an all in one Media Center control device like this one. I am really glad that this is a quality product that can be relied upon. I bought one and 3 months later I bought another one for another Media Center PC. Theonly thing that I didn't like was the price I paid for the first one - so check for prices at different times and different retailers.
4,Good stuff,"Small and reliable. This device seems solid and has everything you need to forget that you are using a computer in your living room.If you have kids, this will help to hide it from them.No more cables.The trackball is good enough if you lower the speed of the mouse to its minimal value.The keyboard seems solid. However, I found it too small for my fingers. But again this is not a problem for the use of a multimedia computer in a living room.You can buy this product with no worries. This is a decent investment."
3,"Good for media centers, not for permanent desktop keyboard replacement.","The wireless has a slow response rate. It's hard sometimes to tell if you've typed a key, I started getting a deterioration in the wireless after a week or so, or maybe just an increase in the impatience to go slower. But why should I slow down, it was 60 bucks? IMO, This is fine if you're looking for a quick fix for something like an entertainment center where you'll be using it infrequently and want the convenience of a keyboard/trackball combination. But it's completely inadequate if you are looking for a permanent replacement for your keyboard. I do think it is a very nice design idea, the scroll is in a good location, it just needs better wireless. All in all, I give it a 3 because I think it's good for entertainment centers or to just throw on the coffee table."
2,Only connects when it wants to.,"I'm using this with an old mac mini that is set up a a home theater box, so Windows users may have a better experience. Very frequently, almost every day, it loses its connection. I hit the connect button on the USB dongle and nothing happens. The only thing that works somewhat reliably is to remove the batteries. The fact that the battery door is flimsy plastic and doesn't close properly doesn't help things."
4,But it only works fully with Vista/ I have XP,"Having bought a flat screen, I decided to hook up my laptop to it. I bought this wireless keyboard/mouse. What a no brainer, no wires across the room to trip on. It does work flawlessly except for the jump keys...they do no respond. I'm told that they only work with Windows Vista and I have XP. I've heard horror stories about Vista and won't consider an upgrade. What a shame... but as for the keyboard and mouse, they work excellently and are nicely placed."
3,This is a textbook.,"Didn't realize this would be in textbook format; with chapters, questions and quizzes. Not useful to me as a reference book."
1,Charger doesn't fit,"I had my items delivered to a friend who is based in Texas. He delivered the items to me when he got back in the Philippines and upon testing, I found out that the item that was delivered didn't fit my Zen Vision:M. I am afraid of insisting to put the charger in the dock since it might destroy the unit that I have. The purchase of this item isn't recommended for international customers."
5,"Live in Cape Town, South Africa","I had an opportunity to hear the Ministry of Sound ""Clubbers Guide"" show live while on vacation in Cape Town, South Africa this May. After returning to the states I bought the Clubbers Guide CD. The tracks on this CD where all played (for the most part) live during the show.The CD is truly amazing. A great mix of house and trance......In addition, you will hear a number of tracks on this CD that you would never have an opportunity to hear in the States.enjoy!"
4,It's been a long time since I have had something good to say,"...about an RAW book. The last book I felt was worh the price was COSMIC TRIGGER volume three. But this is an ok book--compulsively dip-into-able and containing references and online resources for most entries. Also, the book seems to summarize where RAW stands on a lot of topics he has written about before (see Crowley, Leary, Magick, etc.) Maybe a bit pricey but I thought it was worth it."
3,"Fun, but needs updating","This book is great for browsing through occasionally - would probably be good bathroom reading - as long as you don't take it too seriously. The ""conspiracies"" range from satirical to loopy to almost believable. My favorite is the unbelievably convoluted ""plot"" surrounding the death of Princess Diana. Since I've just finished another book about conspiracy theories, I was disappointed not to find anything on the ""reptilian"" aliens, which seem to be quite popular on the late-night fringe - or at least they were a few years ago when I worked the third shift across from an Art Bell fan.I would love to see a new edition - a lot has happened since 1998."
3,"Good Structure and Reading, not so good Listening","This book is good in Structure and Reading. In Listening strategies are well explained, but the tests in CD are not. People speak very clearly, and in real exam they don't. So, practice this part with Powerprep software (downloadlable from toefl.com) and you'll see the difference. However, this book helped me a lot to prepare the exam in 50 hours and got a score of 217/270."
5,Longman is really a Complete Course for the TOEFL Test,"improved writing section, Diagnostic Pre-Tests .all the skills you need, more exercises than any other book in the market. Best Preparation for the Paper and Computerized TOEFLfrom well-known publisher .it is really number one"
1,Simply the WORST !!!,"Such a waste of money! This book sucks! There are so many mistakes in it that I sometimes think that Deborah Phillips had barely graduated from high school. The strategies given in the book explain only the tip of the iceberg, they are all common sense. They explain only the basics, which are not enough to get a good TOEFL score. I don't usually write reviews, but for this one - it was a must. In case I didn't make it clear -DON'T BUY THIS BOOK !"
4,Goood for PBT but NOT for TOEFL IBT,I have mistaken the cover of book as if that was for IBT test prep. But this is only for paper based TOEFL but has a computer CD. This not their fault. its my fault. But I wanted to warn potential customers. As fro paper based test preps this book is still good.
5,Best monitor for the price,"Given its stability, the excellent quality, and so on I couldn't ask for a better monitor for the price. I've had it for over a year and it works great."
1,Follow your own path - don't read this book!,"The ethos of this book encourages compromise, self-denial, and repression. Do not pick your partner in this calculated way. Man is born free, and has a duty to accept the brutal responsibilities this freedom brings.Embrace life. Live a vibrant life of instinct and passion. Find your own path. Do not dampen your feeling and emotions by following the dogma and repression implicit in the self-denying philosophy of this book.You can have a successful, fulfilling, dynamic, and happy marriage by working your own way through the undoubtably complex emotional issues which marriage and engagement brings with it.Life is a challenge. Rise to it."
2,Not what I had hoped for...,"My first indication that this might not live up to my expectations was when they experienced ""reentry"" upon arrival at a ""new"" planet. Am I wrong or doesn't reentry imply that you have been there in the past and are returning? Maybe I'm too picky. Then on page 39 Shannon heard his ""shoot"" deploying. It's 'CHUTE! (as in parachute) not shoot!Then, the liberties that he took with planetary science (I almost slipped up and used the word ""geology"" which technically is the study of the earth, not RK3) and morphology really got in my craw. If he didn't have a firm grasp of the subject(s) he should've sought out a technical advisor...IMO.I could go on, but I'm sure you get the idea.It almost felt as if I were reading an advance proof copy that hadn't received its final editing. Maybe if I weren't so picky it would have been an more enjoyable experience."
3,Times have changed,"For solid scientifically backed information, I found this book lacking. Not suprising, as it was first published more than twenty years ago. Having said that, the information that is contained is interesting, and will take a lot of Amazon owners back to pioneering days of birdkeeping, before Surgical sexing, disease control, quarantining and nutritional studies. Complete details of all commonly kept species as well as a few rarities is included, with the author relaying a lot of personal excperiences with this unique family of parrots"
5,PASIONES EN LA MARAVILLOSA VOZ DE JESSICA,"AL IGUAL QUE SU DISCO ANTERIOR ESTE DISCO DE JESSICA ESTA MARAVILLOSO. JESSICA...QUE BELLEZA, QUE VOZ, QUE TALENTO! ESTE DISCO TIENE MERENGUE, BALADA Y BACHATA. DE TODO PARA TODOS LOS GUSTOS. ADEMAS DE UN EXCELENTE CONTENIDO MUSICAL, TAMBIEN TIENE UN EXCELENTE CONTENIDO VISUAL YA QUE ESTE DISCO TIENE UNAS FOTOS DE JESSICA MARAVILLOSAS!"
1,Numerous typos in the book,"I would rate the book very good. The subject matter and the conclusions drawn from it are excellent.However, the book is poorly proofed. It has numerous typos -- words that are missing, with a question mark in their place. I wrote to the publisher about this but received no answer, so I can only assume that they aren't bothered by the typos and have no intention of correcting them or answering my letter.I will look for the book from another publisher in the meantime, and will avoid publications from Cosimo Classics in the future."
3,goggles,"A small frame for the face which leads to leaking. I wanted them to help with my goggle marks, which they do, but they leak as I swim. Not a good trade-off."
4,Comfy and supportive,"I'm a horizontal brief kind of guy, and these briefs fill the bill. They're well made, soft, and comfy. My only complaint would be that the leg holes can sometimes get stretched, and I get caught in the pinch. But then, I'm a thin guy with thin legs. But that's a relatively minor thing, really."
1,"Oh Munsingwear, how you have fallen . . .","I wore Munsingwear briefs exclusively in the 1980 and 1990s, so I thought I'd try them again. Bad decision. In 2011 I first ordered the full rise briefs and the pouch was too saggy. So then I ordered the mid rise briefs and the opening to the pouch was miniscule. The size was correct, but the utility of the briefs was abysmal. Good luck if you buy these.Jan 2013, an addendum: The full rise Munsingwear briefs are the best briefs I have discovered for wearing with long underwear. Their saggy fit actually works well with the additional layers that long underwear creates. This benefit is not enough for me to change my rating to 2 stars, but I would now give them 1 1/2, maybe more if you live in a climate where long underwear is necessary for long periods of time."
4,Munsingwear Men's Brief,These pouch briefs are the only kind I wear. They're very comfortable and wear extremely well. I used to be able to buy them locally but no more. Thanks Amazon for providing a supplier.
3,Munsingwear design and size,"I have always liked Munsingwear underwear, specifically the design with the horizontal fly. I haven't been able to find it in retail stores for a long time, so the only way to resupply is via on-line purchase. The only issue I have is that the sizes have periodically changed over the years. The size that I wore in the past is now too big, probably because it's ""full-rise"" now, which I don't recall from the past. So I don't know whether to try again with ""mid-rise"" or whether to go with a smaller waist size. At least it arrived very quickly, soon after I ordered it, even with free shipping."
2,Disappointing,"When I first started buying this underwear many years ago it was made in the USA. Then, several years later, it was made in Canada. I never had any trouble with this underwear; it was just fine. I bought 18 of these a few months ago and noticed they are now made in India, which might explain why this underwear has become a disappointment. The stitching on the waistband came loose on five, the stitching on the label came loose on one, on four the hem on the inside flap of the fly is wide and well stitched, but on the other 14 it is thin and cheaply stitched, and the leg openings on some are fine, but on others are too tight. Perhaps it goes without saying, but I won't be buying this brand again."
1,Old standby product has gone down hill,"I have been wearing this product for at least 25 years or more and never wore any other underwear. Recently purchased annual supply and was very disappointed. Just overall horrible fit-loose leg openings, garment stretched after one use, baggy pouch area and waist band that gave too much space. I might as well have been wearing nothing for all the support I got from this product. I ordered this same product from another vendor and the result was the same. I returned all of the garments to the vendors and sent a e-mail to the manufacturers of Munsingwear asking if they could offer any solutions or if they were having problems with the item. They have not responded and I will not buy this product again.RMNew Jersey"
1,Munsingwear,The same great quality and comfort that I have come to expect from munsignwear kangaroo pouch underwear. Nothing else matches the fit.
2,musingwear pouch underwear,"Used to like Munsingwear pouch underwear-was the equal of Jockey, but recent purchases prove otherwise. The leg openings are too large and the waist band is too narrow making and not substantial making for a ""loose"" fit. They lack a secure feeling. Will not purchase again. Very disappointing."
2,Will the REAL Jet stand up?,"""Heads up"" JET fans there are two bands with a completely different sound. This was not the sound I was looking for!"
5,Great product !,Great product that really helps with chronic pain relief. I have been on the product for about 3 years and have been very pleased with it. If I run out I know it. I use to be on Celebrex and then all the warnings for heart issues came out. Doctor switched me to Mobic then to Reliphen and Neurontin and after awhile they all got to my gut. With this product I get relief and also help to give my body some nutrients that will help keep the few discs and vertebra that I have left in good shape. Hope it works for you.
1,Horrid!,"This book not only had spelling errors and NO pictures, it actually said ""Not ready for publishing"" when I recieved it. I got this for my dad as one of his christmas presents and I really wish I could get my money back!"
4,A History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters,"When I read the first two chapters of this book I was blown away. The first is absolutely hysterical, and the second begins that way, but leaves you staring at the book in disbelief, unsure what to make of what just happened. I couldn't wait to read the rest, but I have to say that I was a little disappointed.While each story is very clever, and the connections that run through the book are fun to find, I found myself getting a little bored. The chapter titled ""The Mountain"" seemed to go on for much too long, and wasn't as witty as the others.Nonetheless, I think this one is definitely worth reading. Even if it does become a bit slow in places, I can't argue with the mastery of Barnes in connecting all of these seemingly unconnected chapters, and in his ability to really make you think about the world around you."
2,Not what I expected...,"I ordered this sword display stand, so I can display my sword collection. When I received my shipment, I noticed that I was missing 2 screws that were crucial in putting it together. The display stand had a number of nicks and scratches on it, which I found surprising since the box was shipped inside another box 10 times bigger then the actual box itself and stuff with paper to prevent movement during shipping. The samurai medallion is plastic, not metal, which I also found disappointing."
2,Failed potential,"This book offers a variety of ice cream recipes. The authors include many favorites for ice cream, sherbets, and sorbets. The color photos are a plus. The book groups recipes by season.There is one major drawback which prevents me from recommending this book. Recipes call for uncooked eggs. Many call for 3 or more eggs or egg yolks. Salmonella is a real concern, especially for the young, elderly, and immune impaired individuals. The authors do not mention this potential hazard. They should offer a cooked egg alternative for those who are concerned.I received this book and an ice cream maker as gifts. I plan to make the basic vanilla and chocolate cooked ice cream recipes included in the ice cream maker's instruction booklet, and use this book for ideas on adding ingredients to create flavored ice creams."
3,Soul stirring,This music made me very homesick. A good CD but not quite as good as hearing this powerful group of Tobagonians in person. Keep on singing.
3,"pretty, but not fantastic quality","I purchased two of these frames because i couldn't find any others that held two 4""x 6"" frames horizontal, and two vertical. But if you can find the same type of frame in a store, I would. the design of the frame is neat, but mine arrived slightly damaged, and there seemed to be marks on it that I couldn't rub off, and it didn't come with any nails or anything to mount it on the wall. If you don't care about some imperfections, I'd say buy it, but if you can buy the same thing in a store, i'd say go for that."
3,"The last ""old Olivia"" album","This 1974 album is a mixture of 6 new tracks written for the Eurovision Song Contest, and six others. The ""others"" are easily the best on the album. Of the six Euro songs, the title track won the ""elimination"" contest, but fell into 4th place behind Abba's ""Waterloo"" at the main event. Two ballads in the Euro songs - ""Angel Eyes"" and ""Someday"" would have fared better and are good tracks, particuarly ""Someday"" which would grace any other album she has done. The other six tracks step up the quality ladder, with the obvious first release of ""I Honestly Love you"" and ""Free The People"" being my stand outs. Overall it is an unbalanced album (it could be nothing else) but one with enough interest to rate a listen."
5,Greatest Cookbook EVER!,"I own MANY cookbooks (probably too many), but this is by far the BEST. I have made 3 dishes from the Chinese food section so far and each dish has come out perfectly...tastes EXACTLY like take out!! This is just what I needed to keep my points in check without feeling like I am giving up my favorite take out foods! The shrimp-and-pork wontons, won ton soup and general tso's chicken were all to die for! I highly recommend this book, the Chinese food alone is worth the price of the book."
2,Meh,"I chose two recipes out of this cookbook -- a Mexican chicken and rice dish and a Greek pasta casserole. The Mexican chicken and rice dish was so spicy, it was unpleasant! The Greek dish had the opposite problem -- it was incredibly bland. Neither one was inedible, but it wasn't anything I'd ever cook again.I guess I'm in the minority -- I was super unimpressed. My family picked at both meals, and refused to eat the leftovers."
5,"Yum, yum!",I bought this book yesterday as my reward for starting back up with the WW program. For dinner last night we had Hot & Sour Soup and General Tso's Chicken for a total of 6 points. Tonight we had Skinny Chimichangas - 4 points. I doubled the recipe because I think these would be perfect to pack in lunches this week. Everything has turned out great. Later this week I plan on trying the Caramelized Onion and Roast Beef Sandwiches. The recipes all seem really easy with readily-available ingredients. I've marked quite a few recipes to try.
2,it's a remake of original songs,"pretty nice music, but i didn't quite expect it to be remake of the songs. I would rather have the originals. I guess I didn't research it enough."
5,Just like I remember - almost,"I had these as a child over 50 years ago. They were a favorite of my Italian grandmother. These are as close as I have ever found to those from the family, even to the little boxes and pictures on them.The candies themselves are more consistently soft and chewy - we always had a few that had dried out and became too stiff. Modern packaging probably helps a lot.The only issue is size. These are still the same size of box as I remember, but over the years the treats themselves have shrunk to the point that they fill only a small fraction of the space available. Too bad, I would rather pay a bit more and get a properly sized treat."
1,No mention product is artist re-recordings on line,"No mention that...""this album may contain re-recorded tracks by the original artists is specified when displaying product on line. If you make this purchase, receive it, open it and play it without first looking at the...""may contain re-recorded tracks by the original artists. Tracks featuring groups may not include all the original members"" on the back cover...You will be greatly disapointed. The re-recorded versions are a poor representation of the originals as the artists voices are older, slower, and painfully barely resemble a shadow of what they once were! Might explain why this product cannot but should be demo'd on line!"
5,Wise Women,"Wise Women Don't Worry, Wise Women Don't Sing the BluesWise Women Don't Worry, Wise Women Don't Sing the BluesHere is a great book that can actually help people transform their lives. In each chapter Jane uses a story from her past to illustrate how ideas can limit your life, and then provides a ""worksheet"" for the reader to use a guide to applying the lessons of the book to a real-life example from the reader's life. This is a great book for study-groups or self-study. Jane is a distinguished author who went on to become the founder of The Center for Spiritual Living in Carlsbad, California."
3,constipating formula,"My 5 month old seems to like this formula. He eats a lot and spits up a lot. I tried this formula for that reason. He continued to spit up about the same on this formula as he did on the Bright Beginnings Gentle formula.It's not really a concern because he is gaining weight like a champ. However, since he has been on the Gerber Good Start Gentle Plus he has only had a BM every 3 days. He used to have one every 1-2 days. I thought maybe he just needed time to adjust, but after four 25oz. cans we are still not regular. I am switching back to his old formula."
4,Check Prices,"We had been using Similac Soy formula, but found that to be giving our baby serious constipation, so we switched brands and landed on Good Start. We have had no issues with this formula. I am mainly going to comment on price... this product sells at Walmart for 21.00 per 25.7oz container (considerably less than the price on Amazon). Just a FYI."
4,Good Study Aid,Using this reference guide along with the materials supplied in my real estate class I was able to pass the examination for the real estate sales person license on the first attempt.I did not give it 5 stars because the CD with sample exam questions that comes with the book is not compatible with MACS - something you don't find out until after you buy it!
3,Standard 80's directions,"This is by far the best Tears For Fears LP recorded. As with most 80's bands, the first was often the best they had to offer. It contains all the usual melodies we came to love in the 80's. Depression mixed with wide open sound was the norm. The group was once mentioned by Robert Smith of The Cure as being the exact thing they never wished to become. You decide."
5,Outstanding,"I have till late been only a casual listener of TFF, and in fact was considerably disappointed with their later ""Seeds of love"" album. Nevertheless, I took a chance on a triple set of what seemed to be at least two very good albums (Hurting / Big Chair). Having listened to all three now, I have to say that ""The Hurting"" is TFF's masterpiece. The album is more melodious than its successors (bar perhaps the slightly raucous ""The Prisoner""), and the vocal delivery and guitar/synth arrangements are much more effective. ""Big chair"" just has two great tracks, but this one is consistently good from beginning to end. If you own just one TFF record, this should be it. ""Mad world"" and ""Pale shelter"" alone are worth the price of the CD"
5,This is a classic album,The Hurting is by far the greatest effort put out by Tears for Fears. It is a great freshman effort that in my opinion they were never able to match again. This album is the definitive work for a couple of gloomy lads. Every song (with the possible exception of Prisoner) is great.
1,"As I sit with them on, not moving my toes at all and watch them slip off...","I think, well there went ten bucks down the drain. I was going to return them but since I wore them I thought not. I have some ball of the foot and toe issues of late and saw the ""real yoga toes"" on a search and decided to save $25. Can't imagine the real ones being worth that much. Perhaps they are. I am using these ""cheap""er ones now and do see some minor benefit from the idea. It's just that they keep sliding off. I am reaching down often to get back on. Perhaps my toes are too small. My husband laughed when he saw them on me and said ""boy, did they see you coming""! LOL Well, try this... I remembered I had some pedicure toe seperator sponge things... low and behold... THEY STAY PUT!!! WOW! Who would have thunk for a dollar and 99cents you could get same effect! I suggest to try that first."
1,No Warm Fuzzy Feeling Here!,"Ok, Nicholas marries Eleanor because his brother ruined her and she may be carrying his child. Then he supposedly falls in love with her but keeps a mistress(he's only sleeping with her for the sake of his country...he doesn't enjoy it...what a load of garbage)and avoids Eleanor so that he won't hurt her by going from his mistress's bed to hers. Personally, I routed for Eleanor to run away with Lord Middleton. I mean I felt absolutely no sympathy for Nicholas..in fact I grew to seriously dislike him. I'm sure that England could have found some other way to get the information Nicholas was looking for without his mistress. In the end Eleanor just forgave him and took him back because of course he did it for his country and didn't mean to hurt Eleanor. If you are looking for a story that leaves you feeling like things worked out the way they should and the characters deserve to live happily ever after this is not the book for you!"
1,This book is just awful,"I'm sorry, I usually love Jo Beverley's books but this one was just plain awful. The hero was such a wimp and went along with other people making her decisions way to easily. Her husband is such a jerk! He has a mistress, not for pleasure but for his country. Ok fine, but then, the wife finds out and she just accepts it. Please, that doesn't work. Then! when everything settles and he tells her he loves her, she makes a comment about her daughters eyes looking like his and he has the nerve to say ""or Kit's"" - implying that the baby may be his brother's. Of course, we never really know but does it matter?? No!! I didn't by this book at all! I felt no love in this book, and this is supposed to be a romance. I gave it one star as opposed to none because I actually like the Christopher character. I found him to be caring and sensitive, eventhough he did rape her."
2,Unvelievable even for a Regency,"I agree with the reader who says the plot is not very believable. Eleanor may have been a lady, but she was no fool.The letter from Kit to his brother Nick, asking him to marry or lose his allowance made me laugh out loud.If the other Rogue books are like this one, I think I will pass when they are reissued."
2,Japanese Rise Again,This book is imperialistic in that it psoitions the Japanese-American critic as the master-mind of Asian-American discourse.Kind of disgusting to see this discourse reasserting itself after finally getting out from under the Japanese juggernaut that pinned down Asian people for most of the 20th century.Does anything ever change?
4,Brilliant,"This is the soundtrack to an Icelandic flick called ""Angels of the Universe"". It is psychedelic at best although it offers that fuzzy has synonymous with Sigur Ros. I would describe this as a masterpiece. People who also like Björk, Dada Pogrom, and Mum will be pleasantly thrilled. It is perfect bedtime music."
3,( ) is better,"I would like to consider myself a tough reviewer. The previous CD i bought from Sigur Ros, (), really astounded me in it's beauty, especially becuase it was so simple. It reminded you as to what heaven could be like. This CD, however, despite it's peacefulness, didn't quite measure up to () for two reasons: 1, because there is almost no vocals in it, which is in my opinion, the best part of Sigur Ros, and 2, because it can be very boring. Sometimes it is hard to tell when the songs even change. However, when you come across tracks such as 'Shave' and 'Death announcements and funerals', you are compelled to feel that feeling that can only Sigur Ros can deliver. If you already have all of the other Sigur Ros albums, I would recommend this. Otherwise, it would probably be best to go with ()."
2,Clogs constantly!,"Have owned this item for 4 months and had to clean the hose of clogs at least 5 times. It clogs on pine needles, trimmed hair, and darn near anything else. It doesn't even have the suction to get dry cat food into the collection bin, it all gets stuck in the roller area.I have small children and this vacuum is just not up to the kind of things they spill.Unless you are vacuuming dust and only dust I would not recommend this vacuum."
2,Cleans by spreading the dust around evenly!,"After 18 months, I cannot use this vacumm anymore because blows out too much dust. The seals do not seem to fit properly and emptying the filter is dreadful. Perhaps it is the nature with all bagless vacuums, but I feel like I need a shower after emptying the dust container. I am going back to a vauccum with a bag taht gets thrown away with the dust it traps."
5,gift,I got this as a gift for a teenage girl. It looks like a good way to start. I hope she enjoys it.
2,Doesn't stay tuned!,"I bought this as a beginner guitar for my 4 year old nephew. Recently I went to visit him for a week and played his guitar 2 to 3 times a day, and each time I had to retune it. Even when it's tuned it doesn't sound that good. As far as how it looks...it looks and feels kind of cheap. Next time I'd spend a lttle more money and get something that doesn't need to be tuned every few hours!"
4,Great toy - makes a great gift,"Both my kids received the milk carton radio as a gift and they both LOVED it. They were allowed to decorate them themselves, and they really enjoyed it. The novelty does wear off after a month or so, but for the price, it's a good toy."
1,no water,"If you buy this tub you will be greatly disappointed at the drainage system and any help from Kohler. It is the cheapest piece of overpriced junk you could buy. Difficult to remove and replace stopper, 0-ring seals fail almost immediately. I suggest before installing it, purchase a separate drain setup from someone else.Trust me, any plumber will know about this. Also, before installing the tub leave it outside and spray water in it a couple of times and wait 2-3 days to see if any rust starts coming up through the porcelain. There are a number of problems with the factory getting the finish consistent. Do not install it if you see any rust spots, send it back immediately."
5,The best book I ever read on Indian spirituality.,"This is a fascinating book, showing what was the spirit of Indians, through this war chaman that Geronimo actually was. It is a deep initiatic story, which could give birth to the best movie scenario about Indians. It changes forever the idea we have about Indians and gives us keys on our own spiritual path. I rate it on the 5 best books I read in my life, and I've read thousands, being a book reviewer in a French magazine.Read this"
3,Get the 4 track version,"The 4 track cd is worth getting if your after all the cake singles. firstly it comes in a jewel case unlike the 2 track version which comes in a non gloss cardboard sleeve which is very hard to keep in good condition.The 4 track version has 'its coming down' as well as the other 3 mentioned by an earlier review. jolene is the standout track as it is one of the few live cake songs you get on their singles, and one that sounds truely live whereas some of their other ones almost sound like studio performances.not a bad single, dont blow the budget to get it though."
3,War Dancing,Well the movie as such isn't too great but it is worth owning because of Adrian Paul. Can't understand why he isn't mentioned in the star line up as he is definitely the best actor and dancer in this movie
1,A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY,"I was shocked when this ""book"" arrived. 24 pages hardly constitues a ""Book"". It is a brief pamphlet that gives a 101 of (mostly cross country) jump design. No instructions on how to ""make your own jumps"" here. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,Get em all,"The last season of Fringe is going on now. It is not quite as good as the 1st 4, but still excellent fantasy or sci-fi. I'm still viewing the 4th season. Being on Friday nights, and without tivo, I miss some of each season. Plus it is fun to watch several of the without commercials shows at one time. I love all these great characters. Wonderful actors and writers. Worth your time!"
5,great set!,I enjoy the Blu-ray version of the Fringe. The packaging is quite original and there loads of extras. For the true fan this is the only way to go.
1,"Huge fan of FRINGE, extremely disappointed with this release","I've been addicted to FRINGE for years, and have the first two seasons signed by John Noble and Jasika Nicole. I love the show, I love the characters, and I love the first two seasons on Blu-Ray. The third season was a little bit lacking. The fourth season is an utter disappointment.No behind-the-scenes featurettes from the production, only some people talking about the world mythos. No deleted scenes or expanded scenes, just a short gag reel. And no audio commentaries?! Come on! Fringe fans are among the most dedicated and most loyal to be found, and it's disappointing that WB couldn't be bothered to let the cast and crew record some tracks for them.An absolute disappointment. No reason to purchase this set when the episodes can be downloaded or streamed in HD."
3,Don't Lose Hope,"I only recently discovered this sci-fi series a week ago. I liked it so much that I found myself purchasing all four seasons on Amazon and watching all within a week's period. I grew attached to the original Fringe team, especially Anna Torv as Olivia. When they introduced the new characters in episode 19 of season four, my first reaction was confusion and a little frustration trying to figure out where they fit into the big picture. Once they revealed who Henrietta was, I felt some relief. It's refreshing to see a few new characters on the show. I could easily become a Henrietta fan as much as Olivia if the story line doesn't stray too much from the original plot. I agree with a previous poster that the Observers shouldn't be cast as the villains. Keep the plot interesting with less gestapo story lines and more personal interaction between Olivia, Peter and Henrietta and I'll continue to watch."
3,Good program,"If you like the genre, this is a good program. It is imaginative, well scripted, and the acting is adequate. The film direction leaves something to be desired, but generally, it is entertaining"
5,Best sci-fi series after star track.,"Other than the fabulous dr Walter and his casual way of explaining scientific facts. Action is amazing and the story is nice. I know i know, it is the same time travel and parallel universe mojo. But hey, it is always about story telling and not the story and ho does it better than JJ."
4,Very entertaining Sci Fi,"I would have given 5 stars if it had English subtitles.Interesting story, and interesting science a few steps ahead of the present."
5,Luv It,the show just keeps getting better and better. too bad I only have one more season after this one to watch.
2,"Interesting, but the soundquality can be a huge letdown","The Doldrums has a very muffled sound. As if a pillow was pressed against the stereo out on wich the original recording was being played, and the whole thing was rerecorded using a cassete deck. Or something like that. Anyway, it puts me off tremendously. Cause underneath that pillow there are some very beautiful songs. Ariel Pink has an ear for great melodies and his singing style (wich frequently switches to falsetto)works well. Most songs don't follow the classic song structure, but rather circle around a central melodie. The best moments on The Doldrums are however those songs wich sound like four radio stations being switched back and forth. Too bad the radio is underneath a pillow."
5,THE LADIES RULE!,"Another great one from Penny Vincenzi! I read NO ANGEL and was hooked. SOMETHING DANGEROUS was also an""i can't put it down"" novel which continued with the story of the Lyttons. I found all of the characters to beindividually interesting and unique. Lady Beckenham and Lady Celia are my two favorites because they havewhat it takes to endure a not always easy life. Both are strong women who exude an attitude of non defeat.I found the twins entertaining even as adults and their offspring charming.I'm off to read the third in the trilogy, INTO TEMPTATION."
3,Frightfully and Terribly Exhausting to Read,"The world of Penny Vincenzi's novel ""Something Dangerous"" is entirely populated by rich and beautiful and happy aristocrats who feel compelled to use either ""frightfully"" or ""terribly"" as every other word in their speech, or who think it a monstrous scandal if one does not marry his or her cousin. As such, the world itself is bland and banal, and the people in them frustrating and exhausting to be with. Whoever tends to wish to disrupt the natural order of things -- such as Abbie, a social climber and an aspiring headmistress, who starts an affair with one of the anointed's husband -- are allowed to have their fun and games before they're forgotten and made invisible.Vincenzi is a great stylist, the construction of her sentences noble and refined, and it's apparent that both Jane Austen and George Eliot were heavy influences on her. Unfortunately, there's very little substance in what she writes, and thus little truth and beauty."
4,Beautiful tribute,"I hear this song, a wonderful loving tribute from father to sonand I want to cry because there are millions of kids in the world who don't know who their father is and will never know this kind of love.It also makes one wish that there was more than one Scott Stapp on the planet so every kid could have a dad like that."
3,Math Book,"I ordered SAT Math Subject test book for this seller. The book was shipped very fast and came to me on time. The seller was very nice and easy to connect to. However, the book was written all-over and I do not remember reading about that in the description."
2,"SACD sound overly reverberant, better elsewhere","Because the same thing is available on the cheap Brilliant label, on old Philips and now on Pentatone -which to buy? I love Elly Ameling in general for her light beautiful voice. Storming and shrieking was not her thing. Or at least I thought. This album isn't the one for me. She is in opera mode and there is a harshness to her voice not found elsewhere. Worst of all is the echo-hall acoustic. The SACD version seems to have made it worse. Really annoying for me. Don't spend the extra money on this. Cheap Brilliant is fine for this album. It's not for the Haydn. There the SACD sound pays off."
3,cool pattern & worth the price,cool pattern for our little man. . .but it leaves me wanting something a little more durable and thicker. and it's not very stain resistant. Tomato sauce made it's mark on the first use. We will most likely get enough uses out of it that it will be worth the money in laundry and bathtime savings. . .but I feel this item could be alot better made.
4,Fantastic product for a little Houdini. Only drawback is that it's so thin that the bottom pouch doesn't collect any food.,"We needed a bib where the arms can go through, so this fit that bill. It's easy to clean. It's a nice design too. Only negative is that it's so thin that it doesn't really collect any food at the bottom. So, you end up having to change pants."
2,Not Great,"I made paella with this spice pack the other day and I must admit the flavor was not dynamic. All my guests agreed that something seemed to be missing. Next time, I'll mix my own seasoning from saffron threads and other spices. Too bad, I had high hopes."
5,Solitary Summer,A delight to read when you can not be in the garden and a look back into womens roles.
3,"Beautiful & Wise, But I Couldn't Stay Interested","There is no doubt that this is a beautifully written book full of rich language, poetic meanings and full-blooming descriptions of garden and life. This is an easy read and I love several quotations in the book. One of my favorites:""I had three of these meek men one after the other, and learned what I might long ago have discovered, that the less a person knows, the more certain that he is right, and that no weapons yet invented are of any use in a struggle with stupidity.""Even with all these plusses in the book, I had a difficult time getting and staying interested with this book. At times, I felt the book rambling off in the woods. I guess I could sum up my lack of bonding with the book by quoting one of the books quotes:""Books have their idiosyncrasies as well as people, and will not show me their full beauties unless the place and time in which they are read suits them."""
2,Could be better,"I was excited by the features that this product advertised but the actual performance turned out a good deal different. The dictionary is difficult to use and the keyboard interface for the Russian alphabet just doesn't cut it. It would be a whole lot better if the keyboard could be the kind that matches up with similar sounding letters on the American keyboard. Other products I have do that successfully. I thought the cut and paste function was cumbersome. But the main reason I got this dictionary was to have a source for audio on the pronunciation and that works well. If that's all you want, this is a cheap way to get it. But I think that I'm better off with a dictionary in book form than this electronic one."
4,"Odd, But it Works","I've needed to have my neck worked on, for quite some time now. And I decided to give this a shot.It's an odd device, but it does a pretty fair job of giving me a stretch in my neck. I don't think I would call it traction, exactly, it's far more gentle than that. Which is nice, since I think, in some instances, the force of full traction is more than a little disconcerting.I do have a very large neck (18-18.5) and it can be a little uncomfortable in the first couple of minutes, but I think that may be more a product of my mind - than of the device itself.Definitely let it air out for a day or so before the first use - as it has a strong rubbery odor - which is a little stifling, in and of itself.The only reason I gave 4 out of 5, is because the cloth cover, for the top rib, is a piece of garbage. I've yet to figure out an alternative, but I dumped that thing right off."
4,one flaw,"The traction device works really well, and the size was perfect......Now for the one flaw: the rubber material smells and it is really strong....The company says this will go away in time, but they mean A LOT of time.....I have had it for a few weeks and it works very well for my particular issue....The smell has faded a little so there is some hope that eventually it will go completely........."
4,dr bob's neck brace,"this traction device is helping however after 25 days of use it got a leak and won't hold air. i, therefore, must purchase a new one - not happy!!"
5,Coffeemaker,This was a gift with the my aunt & uncle. All is well so far & they love everything. It all came in great condition.
1,Cusinart DTC-975BKN is AWFUL,"This coffee maker continues to have the smell of plastic no matter what I do with it. I have tried taking advice from people and have tried measures such as Dawn detergent, vinegar ,and vodka. None have worked, and this inferior product continues to stink to heaven. DO NOT BUY IT!!!!"
5,Great Item,Bought this to replace the same model that I have used for about 7 years. The carafe will keep coffee warm for roughly 4 hours. Great product.
2,Disappointed,I was replacing my Krupps wanting to get a larger carafe size and thought this one looked good. I brewed several pots of coffee wondering if it was just me. The coffee tasted dreadful. I gave some to my husband and he thought I was joking. We returned the coffee maker and bought another Krups. Back to wonderful tasting coffee.
2,"nice idea, but...",the cofee carafe keeps brew hot for hours! I have had 4 spillages and alot of mess to clean up because the filter must be aligned properly or else! I also cannot figure out how to program... one of the most important features for me buying... I really wish I could send this back.
4,Nice,"We've had it a year now. It works good, holds the heat great. Looks nice. Simple to program. The beeps are annoying, I wish they could be optional, and the print under the buttons is rubbing away."
5,JenniferJane,"Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker, Black and Stainless SteelWe had a Starbucks Barista coffee pot which was leaking so opted to get this Cuisinart and it is absolutely fabulous. Coffee stays hot throughtout the day - the pour is wonderful and does not leak and I would highly recommend this product. Suggest buying gold filter with it."
3,Good but has issues ...,"I had this machine for over a year now. It is still working but it is a pain.1) I always find a small puddle of coffee under the machine and over the counter. It is messy.2) The display requires a microscope to read and navigate.3) The carafe's top assembly has the propensity to come undone and you have to press on it hard to get it back.4) Cleaning the carafe is not easy due to the size of the opening.5) The carafe's lid is tricky to put back on. As a result, you might end up with a major spillage if you don't screw it on right."
4,pain in the top,works fine BUT the design of the thermos top makes screwing the lid on a challenge.It is more difficult than the older model it replaced
5,Cuisinart Thermal Coffeemaker,"I knew I had had it awhile and we make coffee 365 days a year ...... you do realize until it goes out that you do not have a backup. We had this very same coffeemake for about 7 years and my husband said he wanted the very same one. So I went straight to Amazon that morning (after no coffee) and found it and 4 days later we were back happy again. We love the timer and that we can take the thermal pot into any room that we may be working, reading or watching television and take it with us. It will stay at the original temp at least 4-5 hours (if the coffee lasts that long). The coffee is great whether you make 3 cups or all 12. Obviously would recommend the purchase."
1,Defective design,"This was our third try with this programmable coffee maker. Cuisinart DTC-975BKN. We like the coffee , the thermos and the 12 cup size. However it has now failed 3 times. An essential part of the brewing cycle ""burns out"" so rather than brewing when turned on it simple shows the red brewing light for about a minute and then turns off with no coffee brewed . This failure mode is known to the manufacturer and you can read about in user blogs. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNTIL A FIX IS ANNOUNCED."
1,Messy,"Worst coffee pot ever. Same experience of grounds/ coffee all over counter and floor. Had my husband double check behind me (in case of operator error)-- cover on tight, pot on straight, basket in straight, no blockage in cover, correct filter size -- somehow still overflowed."
1,Poor quality coffee,"Using filtered water, a good paper filter and good coffee (dark roast), we could not get a good cup of coffee from this Cuisinart. I will revert to using what I always have: a Krups or Braun."
2,Coffee and Grounds Spill Over,"Even after reading many reviews regarding the issue of overflows and following all of the directions carefully in the user manual and making sure the lid was properly seated on the carafe, I still had this coffee maker spill coffee and grounds all over the kitchen counter. I wanted this coffee maker to work for us, but I feel like you have to watch the entire process to make sure you don't end up with a huge mess all over the place. 30 minute cleanup and a burned finger is not worth the price of this coffee maker."
3,Missing instruction manual and warranty!,"The instruction manual was missing and the warranty card, makes me think this was repackaged?? Would like to have the manual sent instead of returning it. Will be using the coffeemaker for the first time tomorrow."
2,quit working after 3 months,"Love it when it worked, but after 3 months, it quit working. Will likely try a different 12 cup maker."
2,Worst coffeemaker I have ever used!,"Sounded good, looked good... until you use it. Had it for four months before I gave up on it just this morning, took a baseball bat to it, and ran it over with my car. You have to set up the filter and set the pot exactly right, or else the coffee spills out of the filter area and not into the pot, making a horrible mess. After this last happened nearly six weeks ago, I vowed to watch the coffeemaker every morning to see what was happening and it worked fine... until this morning. I left for just a few minutes and came back to another no coffee in the pot... just in the filter area, and spillage over onto the counter and the floor. I spent way too much money on something like this, just to wind up with disappointment. Cant trust a Cuisnart product at all any more."
2,Keep Looking,"1. Too tall to fit under a normal cabinet.2. Periodically, just messes ALL OVER the place - no clear solution.3. If one person makes the coffee and goes to the gym, the other person has no way of telling if the coffee has been made ... unless it's messed all over the counter. Once the beep happens to tell you that it's done, there are no lights or timer to show that there is hot coffee in the pot, and it's so nicely thermal that feeling the outside of the pot gives you nothing, you have to open it up and let the heat out to know that there WAS hot coffee inside. We got a little timer to set by the pot, but SOMEONE keeps forgetting to set the timer.We're taking ours back."
2,Good But Cannot See Time + other,"Been thru a couple pots .. tried this and going to return it.Pro's"" Hot coffe / thermal cafe great / good tasteBig con: Time and brew time is NOT lit and very hard to see without a bright kitchen light .. only 53 yrs old .. need reading glasses to see time (not lit). Also .. seeing am or pm hard to see and there is NO light to tell you you have set it on automatic perck ... bad design for sure..good luck"
2,"Good Coffee, Stays Hot, but Leaves a Huge Mess","This coffee maker makes good coffee, and the carafe keeps it hot for quite a while, but it's the same story as the other negative reviews. About once a month, something goes wrong with the gadget that releases the coffee into the carafe, and coffee and grounds end up all over the countertop and floor. When I called the company, they happily replaced the part that causes the problem, with no questions asked, but that one malfunctions as well, so it must be the design. On days that it works, I would give it 4-5 stars, but on days that it leaks, just one star for the frustration and mess."
3,Coffee isn't hot enough. Otherwise great coffee maker.,"We decided to try the insulated carafe route of making coffee after reading all the good reviews. The coffee maker is stylish, worked well and poured flawlessly.However, perhaps because the carafe wasn't preheated, the coffee didn't stay hot long. And when having the coffee maker set to have coffee ready in the morning, preheating isn't an option. Without preheating, after 10-15 minutes of brewing, coffee had to be microwaved. After an hour or so, it was lukewarm at best.In the end we ended up returning this model and got a regular, glass carafe Cuisinart coffee maker which has been working very well."
4,Pretty good but hard to read,"I like the product , makes great coffee, keeps it hot for the morning time that we need it too, not as long or as hot as with a heater but pretty good. The lid takes a little getting used to but no biggie.My one complaint would be about the size of the display. It is almost impossible to see if the ""Auto"" light is on when you are setting it up to start at a later time. Very odd in that part of the design.Doesn't help if you are older and maybe not seeing as good as before."
2,It broke within three weeks,"After having a Braun for 20 years, my expectations might have been high, but I do expect a coffee maker to last more than three weeks! Actually, I'm being generous. It was broken right out of the box. The clock gained and lost hours throughout the day. By the third week, the coffee maker wouldn't turn on.That being said, the thermal part was nice, but very slow pouring. The taste was pretty good. Even though I might have received a lemon, I wasn't impressed enough to risk it again."
4,cuisinart thermal coffee maker,"Had my previous cuisinart for 5 yrs. It was going all day without any bitter taste and stayed hot for hours. We didn,t think twice about buying another one. Never got the service from other brands."
3,Help! I bought this in May 2012,"Working fine until yesterday when it started dumping coffee and gounds all over the counter and floor - over and over and over. I've cleaned it well, lined up the spout correctly and the minute it starts brewing, it goes everywhere. I don't know what else to do! Any suggestions?"
1,Didn't last very long,Having had problems with Cuisinart Grind & Brew coffee makers failing within a few years we thought a simple version would hold up better. Wrong. Ours quit a little after a year. The carafe is great and it worked well until it stopped brewing.Too bad it there are so few 12 cup thermal coffee maker choices. I will not buy another Cuisinart product. So far all have failed far too soon considering the cost.
2,Cuisinart DTC-975BKN,"Nice looking coffee maker, quiet, coffee comes out very hot, and carafe keeps the heat in - exellent. Downside - like many other reviewers, I have had coffee streaming out the top of the carafe during brewing. It isn't that difficult to screw the top on the carafe before brewing, but apparently there is a good way and bad way. Haven't figured that out yet...even after having coffee coming out all over the kitchen counter twice. Advice is to watch this coffee maker until it starts brewing into the carafe to make sure the top of the carafe is on correctly, otherwise it will give you a messy surprise upon occasion. Not a great investment on my part."
1,good coffee bad design,"Had older copy of same model for 4 years,made good coffee (as does this one)but everyother time this one misses the pot and put most to all of the coffee on the countertopI thought I was careless, since the older one did this if the pot was not positioned correctlybut even being careful and deliberate - still misses the potsome bad design changecarafe is great keeps the coffee hot for hours.now using a $20 CoffeeMate and pouring onto the old carafeNot a good buy"
1,Always Leaks,"The coffee maker leaks all over the counter every time.Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker, Black and Stainless SteelI once had a Cuisinart electric can opener and that to was worthless."
1,Terrible and Dangerous,This Coffee maker is terrible.#1 The Carafe is incredibly finicky and will overflow all over your counter eventually... when you least expect it and start to trust it. It has happened to us 5 times since April.#2 It is incredibly sensitive to mineral buildup. We have had to run vinegar through it ever few months since we bought it.#3 Today it stopped brewing entirely... and then there was a loud POP... which resulted in my 4 year old getting splashed and all the water running out the bottom of the brewer onto the counter.Checking to see if I can get it replaced under warranty after less than a year.Skip this one...UPDATE: Cuisinart will be happy to replace my unit if I will pay exorbitant amounts for shipping both ways... They really know how to take care of their customers.I am writing their CEO:Attn. Phil SchwartzCorp Office150 Milford Rd.East Windsor NJ 08520
2,The lid drives me insane,"I am on the verge of buying a new coffee-maker simply because I can't stand fiddling with the lid. It does not seat easily to screw back down, and pours annoyingly slowly."
2,Doesn't Keep Coffee Hot;.,We thought that we would like this carafe but was not very happy with it.It did not keep coffee very hot or for very long.We replaced it with a Zojirushi Thermal Carafe that is far superior to theCuisinart.. .
2,Not Impressed,"This coffee maker is well made and looks good. It is touted as being able to keep coffee better than warm for several hours in its thermal carafe even though the burner turns off after the coffee is made. When pouring my second cup some 45-60 minutes later, the coffee was warm but not hot. I don't think you need to spend up to $100 for a unit with that feature and the programmable brew, which we do not use. It is tall, barely fitting between our cupboard and counter top. Truth be told, we probably over-bought. Any basic coffee maker that has the ability to heat the water hot enough to properly brew the coffee grounds would have sufficed and probably cost much less."
2,Overflows over and over,"This is a great idea.....12 cup thermal! Which is why I bought it. BUT, it overflows no matter what we have tried...no, we are not overfilling it, yes, the filter is in correctly. The problem is the coffee gets backed up on the top of the carafe, doeseventually go in but not before running down the sides of the carafe! It must not be dispersing the air as the coffee is trying to go in the top??? What gives? Does keep the coffee hot, love the look , the coffee tastes fine, the 12 cup thermal is great idea...but am spending a fortune in paper towels to clean up the ""overflow""......"
1,Won't stand by warranty,"Keep shopping - Pick another one - this one is WAAAYY too expensive for the amount of time you get to use it for. It just decided to wink off with no warning. Internet research into the problem indicated that this has happened to many, many, many people. Called Cuisinart, thinking I had a three year warranty, but my serial number indicated it was refurbished - news to me. Anyway, I'm out of luck. Next time, I'm getting a cheap $25-30 model (and not a Cuisinart) - short sighted business people that they are."
2,I wouldn't buy another one of these!,"It did make pretty good coffee the first week .... but after that week it just tastes real bitter. Actually, annoyingly bitter.The inside of the carafe stains and is really hard to clean!!!! Nothing I have tried gets the carafe completely clean.The beeping noise doesn't bother me at all.It did leak one time but I do agree with ""whoever"" that this would be caused by placing the pot on wrong or not tightening the lid ... or whatever.The bitter taste and the stained carafe are annoying to me. I'd never buy another one of these."
1,Hunk of Junk,Big disappointment. 7 months have passed. 1. Returned carafe due to leaking after 2 months. 2. Returned the base due to leaking after 7 months. Customer service refused to honor a return. Horrible. Will never purchase Cruisinart product again. Never.
1,It is a great coffee maker until it stops working,"We purchased the first one and it was great. The carafe is REALLY nice. Kept coffee hot all that jazz. Then one day after 6 months it stopped working. We would turn it on and the unit would immediately act as if all the water had already passed through the system and shut off. We had a warranty on the device so we replaced it through the company.$10 processing fee + shipping and handlingThe new machine arrived, worked one month, then died in the exact same manner. Extermely unhappy with this unit and/or Cuisinart. To replace the machine again will be another $10 + shipping and handling.7 months of coffee is now going to cost my family around $150. Should have went to an overpriced coffee house."
4,GREAT COFFEE MAKER,"Coffee is great after 3 years of ownership. There was a leaking problem but after finding the cause, fixed it and has been great ever since. Seems one needs to take apart the lid and clean it as the ball inside the lid has gunk built up on it, like the carafe does and clogs the flow of coffee into the pot. Once I cleaned the lid, It hasn't overflowed at all.. I highly recommend this coffee maker.."
3,Venerable ninety year old solves crime,A venerable old woman was not prevented by the sleazy actions of some of the characters in this mystery tale of a small town club and family disharmony from successfully finding an explanation for the death of a second wife. Harriet Bushrow and company manage to uncover the exaggerations and other discrepancies of the victim's past to uncover the crime or lack of crime in this amusing work set in a small town in Tennessee.
1,Wrong product,"A different keyless remote was sent than the one pictured. It was too cheap to bother with sending back and correcting the problem, but it would have been nice had they sent the same one that was pictured."
5,very good textbook,"does what it says, this book is intensive. not for beginners but if you can pronounce 'ich' and the umlauts correctly then this is highy recommended. for beginners colloquial german would be a better choice. also of note is the good paper quality and the physical size of the book - roughly A4 size.i hope i was helpful"
4,It's not SUPPOSED to have a lid.,"Great pan for a good price.If you follow the instructions to preheat the pan, things don't stick. I've used this pan several times a week since I bought it some months ago, and the only time I had anything stick was when I didn't let the pan get warm first.Other things I like about the pan are that it is easy to clean, the handle stays nice and cool, and it has a nice balance/weight to it.The negative reviews based on the absence of a lid are misleading. There is no claim made in the description that the omelet pan comes with a lid. The skillet comes with a lid, yes, but not the omelet pan. (Most decent omelet pans don't come with lids.)"
1,No lid with this pan,Although the advertisement indicates that this pan comes with a lid you will not receive one and no one at customer service will know why not. Best look elsewhere if you need a lid with this pan.
2,MAKES A GREAT FRISBEE FOR YOUR DOG,"Normally I don't review whack albums, but due to the high marketplace price of many of Tre-8's albums & underground rappers in general, I'm gonna give ya'll the scoop on ""Dey Scared of Me."" I bought this album expecting a lot more--Tre-8 did do a record with Master P back in the day (Ghetto Stories). Bull**it aside however, this album is NOTHING BUT HYPE. I purchased this album used for $30, and it was a complete waste of money. Yeah, it has a cool cover and the track names sound tight, but its been about nine months since I bought this album and I stopped bumpin it after two weeks. It has a couple of good songs on it--tops, but it lacks the sound I was expecting. BOTTOMLINE: dowload track #3 ""Down South Hustlers,"" and #9 ""Half of Me"" to see the best of what ""Dey Scared of Me"" has to offer."
3,edited versions of show,"I purchased this set thinking, it consisted of entire episodes, but each episode is edited, so that not all the guests mentioned actually appear. I was waiting to see the singing duo of April Stevens and Nino Tempo and banjo player John Hartford - and then the episdoe just ended. And every episode has at least one performance cut out, so I would not purchase these sets unless you prefer edited shows."
4,Good,"It's the Smothers Brothers - of course it's funny. It'd be fun to see a non-best of with more episodes, but it's great to see the show again after all these years."
4,"Yes, but","Yes, this *is* the Smothers Brothers, and yes it is wonderful.But not the complete season; only 11 shows.Yes, the scenes are original and uncensored.But the shows are not complete! Some scenes have been omitted.As great as this is - and it is great - you should know that you are neither buying a complete season, nor complete episodes."
4,Awfully good,"I highly recommend this excellent adaptation of Bainbridge's dark, quirky novel. Georgina Cates plays the starstruck Stella with exactly the right combination of yearning naivete and matter-of-fact aloofness. Alan Rickman is mesmerizing as legendary actor O'Hara and happily is able to attract great sympathy during what might otherwise easily be regarded as a grotesque courtship of the teenage actress. And Hugh Grant as the odious Meredith is an extremely convincing villain - it's hard to imagine more of a departure from his usual endearing mumbler, but he pulls off this role with great aplomb. Warning: focusing as it does on a young girl's loss of innocence and the unglamorous underbelly of theatre, this film is for mature audiences only."
2,"erotic, in a way","Interesting and 'different film', set in a different era. I don't quite get the meaning of the movie, but it's definitely NOT a comedy. It's more like a drama. This movie may be disturbing others, concerning the very graphic sex scenes of an older man and a teenage-looking girl. But you can see that the girl seems abandoned and all alone. It seems like a story about coming-of-age."
2,Not a comedy,"This is a confusing and misleading movie. It is not a ""comedy"" (dark comedy or something else). Alan Rickman does a good job, even though he doesn't come into the picture until half way through the movie. Don't be deceived by the box, the ratings, and the fact that it is directed by the director of ""three weddings and a funeral."" Its beginning is very disappointing and its surprise ending is worth a fast forward through the tape."
1,Not creepy at all,"I was expecting a total new book to use in my classroom around Halloween. This one seems to reprint information from her first two books including some information on locations that is not correct. Has she actually been to any of those locations, I was misled.If your looking for a book on folklore than this is for you,otherwise save your money if you have her first two books."
3,used as a cold wrap,I ordered two wraps for my ankle. They seem to be good quality but too thin. The wrap doesn't stay cold long enough.
4,Awesome Southern Cookbook!,"I just got this book not long ago and I could not be happier with it. This is definitely traditional southern food as I know it. Some reviewers implied that the recipes are laden with convenience items but as I thumb through the book-there are just as many that contain fresh or basic ingredients. I mean, let's be fair,ANY collection of over 600 Southern recipes is going to include convenience items. As for the reviewer who returned her book because the biscuit recipe contains self-rising flour instead of using baking powder, well that is just plain silly considering that self-rising flour is just a combination of flour and baking powder and has been around about 100 years. This book would be a wonderful addition to any cook's collection."
3,Not for me,I should have listened to L. Ross' Review. The subtitle should have been Bible of 1950's Southern Cooking. Recipies heavy on the use of prepared foods and packet seasonings.The book claims to contain over 600 Essential Recipies Southerners have enjoyed for Generations. Only a few are the traditional ones my Grandmother cooked at the turn of the last century (1900). This is a book I will pass on rather than keep.
3,"Southern Cooking YES, a Bible of Cooking NO","A very nice book with pictures and history of the Inn. The food served has recipes in the book. Some of the recipes are good and others I would prefer not to prepare. I collect cookbooks from places and areas I have eaten, expecially where the food was exceptional. This cookbook is a disappointment, am I sorry I ordered it, no. It will be a nice memory of a beautiful place with good food."
2,Doesn't last,"When I first got it, this seemed like a good deal. But three half-lives later, the tape is only 6mm wide..."
2,3M NASCAR Tape is better,"Think about it - tape made to make the Nuclear Regulatory Commission happy or tape made to keep NASCAR cars running?I've used both - the Nuclear Grade tape does not last long on my back yard reactor. It doesn't keep the crumbling cement in place. By the end of winter, the tape is peeling off. And there are NO instructions on how to dispose of it.The NASCAR tape enhances the aerodynamics of my car - we go 7MPH faster and use less gas when the hood's held down with 3M 6969 NASCAR tape.3M 6969 48-Millimeter-by-54.8-Meter Duct Tape, SilverWeather doesn't bother it. I give it out as Christmas gifts every year.It's not the IQ of the people using it, it's how fast their cars go."
4,Aaaagh!,"I could not put this book down! I love svh,and when I found out who died I could not believe it. All night I had a wierd feeling in the pit of my stomach. I can't wait to read Aftershock! All the svh books are good, but this one was especially intriguing!"
2,Seattle Slew never showed up.,"I've been watching horses run for the longest time, but the one horse that captured my heart totally was Seattle Slew. Already aware of Slew's history, I couldn't wait to read this book. What I got instead was a dry recitation of numbers, times, dollars won, backside squabbles, but never once did the personality of Seattle Slew himself ever emerge. I can easily google just about every fact in this book. What I wanted was a portrait of the fierceness that was Slew. In September of 2010, Steve Haskin wrote a blog on Bloodhorse about ""The Life and Death of Seattle Slew"". That wonderful blog captured the essence of Slew and was so emotional that even Mickey Taylor, Slew's owner, posted a grateful comment. More was told about Slew in that one small blog, than this book ever presented. Seattle Slew was fierce on and off the track. This book is a pale reflection seemingly geared for a dull accountant."
2,"I don't like Celine Dion type of pop, so I didn't like this",Seems very derivative of lots of pop songs. It's rather cheesy. I wish I hadn't gone by the other reviews because I wasted [$$].
3,"Sexy Voice, But ...","I like the first song, 'Gitan', very much, but the rest of the album is basically standard, histrionic Euro-pop, very much like Celine Dion, Eros Ramazzotti, or Laura Pausini. 'Sous le vent', in fact, is a duet with Dion. To give you an idea of his approach: Rene Angelil, Dion's husband and manager, manages Garou. Like Ricky Martin, a lot of Garou's appeal is based on his physical attributes (which are considerable.)However, I like his voice - it's low, growly, and sexy. He definitely can sing, and belts out these pop songs with a lot of emotion.Garou is a French-Canadian singer from Quebec who sings in French. The French lyrics are included in the packaging (thank you, Sony), without any English translation. His first wide exposure came when he played Quasimodo in the musical 'Notre-Dame de Paris', and 'Seul' is his first solo album.The cd's sound quality is very good, and the musicians are fine. The voice is great; I just wish he had chosen to sing different songs."
3,Interesting....,It was a pleasantly fun read. It could have been better written. Amy should have given a good hissy fit over Jed's job. She should have done a lot of things that she didn't. Other than the predictable storyline the book was pretty good.
5,Proud owner of all the JAK books but the JAYNE TAYLOR titles,"My paperback copy is falling apart and I have been waiting impatiently for an e copy.This is Krentz breaking out of ""skinnies"" and nailing it without any""whoo-whoo"" stuff.Ilove the double mystrey the hot romance and the parents with their own wild past."
4,a decent book that takes a little time to get used to,"I bought this for a college class. The way it is divided into ""lessons"" is different from what I was used to. The projects on the CD helped me learn this program. Taking the time to read the material then use the CD in the back to do the projects is worth it! Halfway through the class the different style of this book started to click and I have used it since then many times as a reference. I would recommend it to any beginner that has little experience with computer design or computer art like I was at the time I took the class.As for the other reviews on Amazon on the other ""Adobe ... revealed"" books, they are rather confusing because it seems like some people posted reviews on the wrong book. It seems there is more than one edition for some of the ""revealed"" books, (some in color, some black and white, some include a CD, some don't.) So be careful you buy what you really are looking for."
4,Red Dragon,"This was for one of my grandson, who had great fun with it at Christmas. He is a very imaginative kid, so he played with it for quite a while. I don't know how successful it's been since then."
5,A little note about the Fullscreen DVD...,"This film was FILMED in fullscreen. Just thought I'd let everyone know. It's aspect ratio is 1.33:1, meaning it's a ""full frame"" film. In order for it to be widescreen, the top and bottom portions of the full frame image would have to be covered with black bars, in order to create a widescreen image. This process is called ""Soft Matte"". Anyway, the DVD for this film does present the whole image for this movie."
5,A key text defining an alternative to capitalism.,"Is there an alternative to the exploitation,boss domination, environmental havoc, dog-eat-dogcompetition and otherills of capitalism? ""Well Soviet centralplanning was tried and that failed,"" you say?Hahnel and Albert argue that there is a thirdalternative -- Participatory Economics orParEcon. (The other reviewer's description ofParEcon is an inaccurate caricature.)This book provides a concise introduction toan economic model that is neither Soviet-stylecentral-planning nor based on the market. Thecritique of both markets and central planning iswritten clearly. At the same time, this bookcontains formal proofs of the economic adequacyof their model, and is therefore, in parts,more technical than most of Albert and Hahnel's otherlittle books like ""Moving Forward."""
4,One of Gloria's Best Singles!,"Love this song, which is one of Gloria's very best uptempo songs. It should have been a bigger hit than it actually charted. Gloria and the band cook on this one. Great to hear in so many versions !"
3,The end wrapped everything up too quickly,"I enjoyed reading this book and following all the characters. Initially they are introduced and eventually you find out that they are all connected. The descriptions are very vivid and you can really imagine the characters. The story was interesting and kept me reading.But at the end of the book I felt like I was watching a show on tv and they were hurrying up to wrap up the plot before the end. There were so many other twists and turns that could have happened, but it was almost as though the writer thought she had written enough and that was it.This is definitely a book you would get from the library."
2,Story line took too long,"I've read every piece of fiction that Pearl Cleage has written, and I have to say that I was disappointed with this book. There were too many characters, and the plot took too long. I made myself complete the book just to see how it ended. The characters were too predictable and very transparent."
5,Favorite season so far,I love Glee and this has to be my favorite season. Season 2 isn't far behind. Yes the show has it's problems but I love it all the same
4,Awesome!,"My daughter has been wanting this video for a while and the stores had it for $50, this was the cheapest I have found it. I was super excited and super fast shipping."
3,Cutted scenes not in the BOX,"Unfortunately the long promised Klaine ""ring"" scene will not be included. But for the people who live outside North America it's a good opportunity to have the DVD's before having them available in maybe one year in Europe.The show have however still some intersting events: Klaine first time, Klaine first time and Klaine first time. All the rest it's a bit a mess."
1,Wrong Region,I was very excited to receive my Glee Season 3 - but I was sent the wrong region . p.s don't try to change regions on your Apple Mac - only 4 changes and you change regions forever - boo hoo .
4,It keeps you intriqued!,"I picked up this book as I was headed on vacation to Martha's Vineyard. I chose it because the setting of the book was Martha's Vineyard, which I thought appropriate. I like to read books of the island, because it is so easy to assimilate the setting. However, I found the book to be filled with just the right amount of intrigued and suspense, filled with turmoil and tempestuous feelings and attractions, that it kept the book alive and moving. I could feel the anquish of the woman whose husband left her for the conniving younger woman...especially as she destroys everything he treasured that he had left behind. You can feel for the daughter who feels betrayed by her father, but torn apart by her mother, and used by her sister who relies on her to handle it all. I felt like hitting the father over the head for the sap that he was, and shaking the potential lover the his stupid lies. Overall, a nice book, set in a wonderful place!"
3,Good reading,"I got a little annoyed with the main female character at first, but soon came to enjoy her personality. There were surprises throughout and I enjoyed the book."
3,Good reading,"I enjoyed Safe harbor, but didn't find it to be one that l couldn't put down. It was still a good book."
5,great grill cover!,this is a great looking grill cover! Its the second one I bought. Pricing on Amazon was about $20 less than the site I bought it from the first time. Cover lasts about 3 years before it becomes a bit worn looking after being in the Georgia sun year round which seems about right.
5,denso air fuel ratio sensor,"great one piece part.went on no glitch.light went out quick as a jack flash.would recomend this part to anyone,great price too!"
5,denso sensor,works great at a great price easy to put on coudnt find a better price anyware help gas milage by about three miles a gallon
2,Best of Weight Watchers Magazine: Over 145 Tasty Favorites,Weight Watchers has two eating plans flex and core. This book is written for the flex plan. I am on the core plan and was hoping to find more recipes for that plan. If you are on the flex plan you may enjoy this book. For those on the core plan I strongly urge you not to waste your money.
2,Decals & Build Issues,"First observation ""out of the box."" Decals for nose art, and wings are only provided for ONE SIDE although instruction show placement for ""missing"" decals. In ""pre-assembly"" placement of internal components (cockpit & intake blank plate) difficult since locating features are inadequate. Mating of fuselage halves difficult due to former comment and minimal indexing pins. Wing tip and tail tips warped."
1,Model kit - NOT diecast!,This is a skill-level 2 model kit. It is not a finished plane and NOT for young children. Decals are especially difficult to apply.
4,That's My Baby by Vicki Lewis Thompson.,I liked this book and read it because I had read the first two books while on holiday. Probably would read more by this author but would not necessarily buy them!
5,"""Spot on"" color... this thing is amazing!","I'm an advanced amateur photographer who takes photos mainly for my own pleasure but I've also sold some prints and I also do some paid assignments. Anyway, trying to calibrate my monitor to achieve accurate color has been a difficult, seemingly impossible, sometimes almost futile endeavor. I've used manual (eyeballing) software tools such as Adobe Gamma without any success. Adobe Gamma got me whole lot closer to my ideal of a perfect color match than my factory default unadjusted monitor, but it was still off... the colors were a little too warm and the gamma a bit too high. Then I decided to order a hardware calibration tool. Enter the Spyder2Express. This thing is amazing! It was very easy to install and set up. About 10 minutes later my monitor was perfectly calibrated! Now my prints match what I see on the screen with amazing precision. I should have ordered one of these things a while ago... it would have saved me tons of headache and wasted prints."
4,Excelent product,This product is essential for all serious photographers.My monitor showed better colors and contrast and its easy to use.Pros: easy to use and setup. Upgradeable to Spyder2ProCons: limited white balance and gamma choices in Spyder2 Express
2,Decent... if you have only one display,"Really not evolved beyond what SuperMac Technology was doing via ADB connections 15 years ago... and completely useless for calibrating a multi-display system. That basic capability is only supported via the ""PRO"" model for $100 more, which Amazon's description fails to mention."
3,Calibrating with Spyder,"Sadly disappointed in this. It's easy to use and I had hoped for greatly improved colors, but despite following the directions to the letter, and using Scott Kelby's super book, I found the adjusted monitor colors way off. I have gone back to using Adobe Gamma."
1,Support - LOUSY!,"The product is so so, there are others that do the same thing for a bit less. But Colorvision thinks it owns the worlds so when it comes o support - you are screwed. Between putting you on hold for ever, not calling back etc."
1,Yellow cast,"Very disappointed with the product. It put a yellow cast into the profile correction and there's nothing I could do to change it. Worked through several calls to tech support and essentially they said I ""knew too much"" about color and that the express was designed for novices. I'm not sure why novices would want a yellow cast on their monitor."
3,Good but..,This is a great product but you are better spending more money on the pro version because you cannot change any of the settings with this one it is all preset.
2,EL CID Audio,The sound of the El Cid is not good. When you make it loud to hear the conversation - it will be too loud if there is only music and no dialogue.
5,Wonderful Addition to Anyone's Movie Library,"Had waited for a long time for El Cid to be reproduced on a CD format and it is well worth the wait. Had forgotten just how good a movie this is!Now, if we could only get the Centennial TV series ...."
1,DID NOT WORK,"Will not operate. On screen it states that the DVD is ""Incompatible Region Number"". Other DVD's WILL work from other and the same region, but for some reason these DO NOT......Will be talking with supplier.."
3,No Spanish subtitles or audio,"There are no Spanish subtitles and no Spanish audio track, as though it did not occur to the producers that some Spanish-speaking people might be interested in seeing this movie about Spain's national hero."
2,SKIMMING THE SURFACE?,"shallow and sketchy. much too preachy and politically correct for my taste. dolph plays the role of the victim very well. was this a pg [ or maybe a soft r ] version of his life? I get the feeling he's leaving much out. superficial, and not thorough enough. not totally without some redeeming qualities, but still a disappointment."
4,Bloom is no big deal in baking chocolate,"In case your chocolate arrives with some ""bloom"" on it, like ""Dwight""'s did - It just shows that the chocolate has gotten a little warmer than 75 F. and some of the cocoa butter has come to the surface. Melt the chocolate (which you're doing to do with baking chocolate anyway) and use it in your recipe. No big deal. ""Bloom"" will not affect the flavor or nutrients in any way."
1,"YOU'RE KIDDING ME , RIGHT ?? NO BRETT ! NO FUEL!!",IT'S A CRYING SHAME THAT CARL BELL COULD'NT AND WOULD'NT GIVE BRETT THE CHANCE TO WRITE SOME SONGS OF HIS OWN FOR THE GROUP. HE IS A BRILLANT AND MOST DESIRABLE SINGER AND SONGWRITER. I REALLY THINK CARL SHOULD RETHINK THE NAME OF THE BAND TO SAY.....THE CARL BELL BAND!!! FUEL NAME BELONGS TO THE LEAD SINGER BRETT SCALLIONS WHO REALLY DESERVES IT!! AND THATS HOW I FEEL ABOUT THAT! DONE.
2,Its ok,"I have always liked Fuel, but had no idea Brett left (yeah so I don't keep up with the times). So boy was I in for a surprise when I started playing this album. First off, this new guy does his best to keep the band sounding like it used to, but it unfortunately doesn't pan out. His voice is pitchy, whiny, and doesn't hit the range Brett did. The album is pretty good with no bad songs, but none that really 'wowed' me either. It feels like generic radio music, because after I gave it 2 full listens, nothing really stuck in my head. I try pretending that this isn't Fuel and instead some new band, so I can give the new guy an honest listen. Its just not a very memorable album. Maybe good backround music when I play on x-box but I can't see myself actualyl looking for this album specifically"
3,Not Bad Not Good,"This is a typical CD for me, like a few songs the others are ok. No songs are terrible and there are a few real good ones but I think I should have purchased the good songs and not a whole CD."
2,"Pretty generic, check out Fozzy for a great CD","Without Bret....the unique sound of fuel is gone. This CD sounds like it could be released by anyone.....not bad, but just like everything else outhere right now. I'd highly recomend you check out new Fozzy...All that Remains Reloaded CD/DVD....that's a great CD...that has it's own distinct sound."
2,"Sorry guys... No Brett, No dice.","If you buy this album, you will find the classic Fuel guitar tracks and melodies. Green is a great vocalists and Carl has always been the writer. But ultimately, to succeed in rock n' roll today you have 2 choices. The first is to jump into a sub-genre stereotype and produce crap. A-la emo, pop punk, death metal..etc. The second is simply to match the right guitar sound with the right voice. Creed did it, Alter Bridge did not. Amy Lee and Ben Moody did it, the ""new"" evanescence can't cut it. But better than any of these was Carl and Brett. Now... it's just not right. You can't help but hear Brett's voice when you listen to this disc and wonder how much better it would've been with him instead. Sorry guys."
2,Stopped working after three months,"Buyer beware: I purchased this product on October 31, 2006, and the watch has already stopped working. Given the price, I expected a higher quality than I received. Timex has comparable products for a fraction of the price."
4,Pretty good google,"I bought these goggles for outdoor lap swimming (2-4 times a week). It's great when it's sunny outside but terrible for low light. I also found that around the mile marker, it's uncomfortable or starts leaking. Good goggles, but I'm still in search for the perfect goggles."
5,Best goggles I've found,"These fit great thanks to the adjustable nose piece. Super clear, non-fogging (even in COLD water), comfortable and great price. The nose piece is not easy to change, and no instructions to be found, but be patient, careful and persistant and you'll have no problems.I'm tired of goggles that don't quite fit right, fog up in cold water, and distort vision, no matter the price. I've had a few pair of Speedo and Nike and not been happy. My first pair of TYR were not adjustable and didn't quite fit right, but these seem to be perfect for me. I'll be ordering a 2nd pair."
1,Not the Tube For Me,I've tried many preamp tubes and this one isn't my favorite.While it was working it was very dark and kinda messy / sloppy.After about a day or two the tube went bad. nice.Would not recommend
4,Top Power Dryer,Purchased Solano Top Power 3200 1875 Watt Dryer..I ordered white and they sent black but appears to be correct model of dryer.My hair really dries quick and adds shine but it goes flat after drying. Still alot better than cheapo ones.
2,Not like it used to be,This toy was purchased for my son. He loves using it but was very disappointed when the picture papers ran out. Only 8 were supplied with this toy!!! The trays are also too small to fish the pegs out so he winds up dumping them on the floor instead. The pegs fall out easily when placed on the screen and the unit itself has that bad plastic smelling odor. I wouldn't recommend this toy.
5,A worthwhile tour de force,"Simply put, the interdisciplinary group of anthropologists, physicians, and others at Harvard have been doing some of the most important and far-reaching work in the area of medical anthropology ever. Byron Good's book, initially given as the 1990 Lewis Henry Morgan Lectures at Rochester, is a beautifully written and accessible summation of much of the innovative thinking going on with his colleagues and former students --- most notably folks like MaryJo Delvecchio Good, Art Kleinman, Lawrence Cohen, Pete Guarnaccia, Carol Mattingly, and others. The major controversies facing anthropology and medicine have been legion, and the discipline has, indeed, been put to ethically-suspect use in service to imperialist ends before. However, as Good argues so effectively, there is still much use for medical anthropology to serve progressive ends in a democratically-ordered world."
3,"Didn't pay attention to the word ""reinforced""","I have been looking for a long time for a natural boar bristle, however, this one is a ""reinforced boar bristle"". There isn't much boar hair in the bristle, but a lot of hard plastic. It is OK, but not what I was hoping for. Otherwise it is well made and looks quite durable."
3,boar hair brush,Excellent product even though it was much smaller than I expected (almost child size). It doesn't matter. My head only has hair on the bottom half.Diane Reinforced Boar Bristle Club Brush #8158
1,SPORTS COLLETORS DIGEST-WHAT HAPPENED?,"I must admit I was SHOCKED when I received my first issue! Granted I have not seen it for years and years so I thought ""lets subscribe again"". Well my first issue came and there wre hardly ANY pages nor any articles , even the ads were skimpy. Dont waste your time subscribing."
2,bosch 13354 o2 sensor,"Bosch 13354 Oxygen Sensor, OE Type FitmentIt works fine on my 98 Toyota Camry V6. I saved money, the cost reduced by half compared to buying the same product from dealership."
5,The best parenting book I've ever read!,"I read this book just before I began my own licensed Day Care business in 1991. It totally changed my attitude toward many of the prior mindsets I'd had regarding child care.It was especially educational for me regarding the needs of infants. I have since passed it along to many new mom's, including my own daughter and her best friend. The Waldorf concept is magical with children. You will be a better parent, grandparent,or care giver if you read this wonderful book. You will find priceless insights into the world of growth and well being of infants and toddlers."
4,Useful very introductory textbook,I'd use this for either a high school level course wherre you do not actually want to teach student how to read or write in either Latin or Greek but you want them to appreciate the influence of those ancient cultures on modern English. The explanations are simple and there are worksheets throughout where the student can practice what was taught. I'd recommend photocopying the worksheets frankly so you can use it multiple times. Not a very good book if you are truly interested in learning Greek or Latin but great for preparing for SAT or ACT tests for college enterance exams.
3,Buyer Beware,"I have always wanted to see footage from the 1975 tour. This could have been a great DVD, except for the technical problems. The copy I received was rarely in sharp focus and the sound was not home theater worthy. There was a lot of 'flaring' in the video. But, on the plus side, the footage is from multi-angles. (I'd like to know the history of this bootleg footage.) Hey, for the price, I fiddled around with my video controls, amped up the sharpness and took the brightness down until the 'flaring' disappeared. Then I listened to it on headphones. Perfect. Man, you can really hear how sly and good Bill Wyman was. He plays a 1950s bass line on 'Rip This Joint' that is out of this world. It's good that you can hear Bill because they rarely take a shot of him! All in all it's worth it to finally see the lotus flower stage. So, get this, but don't expect too much; you can only be pleasantly surprised."
3,The Stones w/ Billy Preston & (ugh) Ron Wood,"All that the other reviewers here have said is SO true: shoddy quality, poor sound, etc - but still, to the best of my knowledge, this is the only pictorial, uh, ""remnant"" of the infamous '75 Stones tour. You know this was the tour where they ""introduced"" Ron Wood as Mick Taylor's replacement (well..not in so many words), and, whew!, having Billy Preston manning the keyboards and Ollie Brown, his/the Stones' ""auxillary percussionist"" for the tour almost stole the show right out from under the Stones. And, yeah, they DO do ""Star-youknowwhat-er"" and the...the...um...""balloon"" pops out right after Keef's guitarsolo after the second verse. But hey, 2 bills is a rediculous price to pay for this thing, it ain't worth it. But, uh, ""have your people get in touch with my people..."" and we'll talk about it..."
2,Couldn't keep shape,"I ordered these looking for some thin ski socks that are warmer than what I currently have. I was initially impressed with the quality. They seemed as warm as my other ski socks and were very comfortable. However, after wearing them skiing twice, the upper part of the socks got way too stretched out and would not retain their original shape. The calf portion was so stretched out the socks would just pool at my ankles. Washing in hot water didn't help. None of my other ski socks have had this problem. If you wear a smaller size (8 or 9) or have insanely skinny calves, this may not be an issue for you."
4,What would YOU be willing to give up for your '15 minutes'?,"Jimmy Conway has always wanted to be a celebrity - and he was sure he'd be really good at it! So when he gets the chance to give up his ordinary life for celebrity status, even under false pretences, he grabs it with both hands.Having gotten a lot more than his allocated fifteen minutes, Jimmy finds that the ""life less ordinary"" he'd dreamed of is not all it's cracked up to be, and that his celebrity status has meant giving up a lot more than he'd bargained for.An excellent commentary on celebrity-obsession and a very funny book!"
2,"aim high, fall flat","What began as an interesting idea in exposing our smoke-and-mirrors-based obsession with Celebrity, results in a dumbed-down morality tale, where we are literally told what the moral is, how to think and feel. The writing overall is fun (a couple of laugh-out-loud moments) and creative, and J.O.'Farell clearly has comedic chops. However, the ending is heavy-handed, unsurprising and predictable in many ways. I felt as though i was watching any episode of Saved By The Bell, where everything is wrapped up nice and tight, and we get the moral explained to us. There is no need to do so: anyone interested in a satire on Celebrity-ism will get the implicit message--J.O.'F should have some faith in us."
3,NOISY ON A 2005 FORD FREESTYLE,"Here is a quick summary on this brake pad set for a Ford Freestyle.Pros:1. Lasts a long time2. Very low dust3. Good stopping distanceCons:1. No brake hardware included (cmon Akebono!)2. Rattling in a Ford Freestyle when going through rough surfacesOther than the clanging noise, I like that this pad lasts a long time. I am on my 2nd set on my Ford Freestyle."
4,"Nothing can escape true love, even time","I enjoyed this story of love that crosses time. In this story Molly is trying to forge a new life for herself and distance herself from her native roots. But, can she really?The man she chooses turns out to be the most prejudice of all men. But, then she finds that the one man that she can never forget is also working for her ""Fiancé"" and she is still in love with him after many years.He is still trying to push her away as he feels that he will not be good for her or anyone else if he gives into his longings."
1,Book froze my kindle,I have started to read the book several times. Each time my kindle froze and i had to do an soft reboot.
4,I AM A LASER is...SCREAM LIKE A BABY from Bowie's SM!! HOT!!,"If you love/collect BOWIE, this is a must-have CD - back in 1973, when AVA was doing back-up vocals from BOWIE (and his main squeeze on the side!), Bowie wrote & produced her long-lost debut for his MAINMAN Productions - the result is some cool, funky, spacey glam-rock-soul that should get much more props than it does - very few people have even HEARD this CD, but if you did, one listen to the sublime opener ""I AM A LASER"" would reveal that it's an early version that would later morph into BOWIE's own ""SCREAM LIKE A BABY"" from 1980's ""SCARY MONSTERS"" - also, you can hear BOWIE's own back-up vocals and influence all over this - AVA went on to record some good funky 80s/90s soul (GOOD INTENTIONS from Capitol, etc.), but THIS is her finest moment, get it now while/if you can!?"
5,large scale two-sided map,"North island on one side, South Island on the other, in scale of 1:1,000,000. Elevations are color coded and roads clearly indicated as expressways, highways or major roads. There are enlarged inserts of Aukland, Wellington, and Christchurch. I haven't used it yet because we take our trip later this year. However, I have inspected it and it appears to have everything I consider useful in a map."
2,Information Reading- Thinking Inventory,"This resource is not as effective as using a QRI/IRI format. I did not like the student cumulative record nor the questioning format: lines & between the lines. The IR-TI did not meet the needs of Preprimer/Primer level readers for assessment. Overall, I would not use this text for teaching at the college level again."
2,Better Than Nothing,"And that's about it. The maps are poorly printed and difficult to read. The book is out of date. And it is incomplete. But there is little else extant about the Bay Area Ridge Trail. No maps, little else at all. I suppose that is typical for an undertaking that continues to grow. But the best way to present information about this trail would be on the Internet. Yet the B.A.R.T. official site is is pretty sketchy. This review is not in any way a criticism of the author. She wrote the first major work on the trail. All her research was original. And in 2002, it was somewhat timely. And the Trail Council works with a very small budget. So someone who wants to find out current information about the B.A.R.T. will have do dig for it. The trail is a grand undertaking, but not adequately described."
4,Love it,"I just love this watch. It's light weight, classy, feminine, easy to read. I just wish it didn't scratch so easily"
1,Worthless Junk,"Keep reading the instructions, follow them, then put this thing in the trash!! Drop the price over & over. Don't buy this at whatever price they advertise!!! I'm overseas so sending it back ain't cheap so do yourselves a favor; BUY ANOTHER BRAND!!!"
4,Definitely above average,"I read a lot of detective books, and realism is important to me. As a therapist, I very much enjoyed the mostly accurate portrayl of a psychologist as the protagonist. I approve of the fact that a common, unglamorous disease (MS) was included as a part of life, which added to the richness of the character. I found the description of the book's setting to be vivid enough that I actually wanted to visit the place myself! Though not superlative, I found this book to be definitely above average."
4,Berglund Center for Internet Studies Review by Jeffrey Barlow,"It might seem that Game Art would be of interest to a very narrow group of enthusiasts. We believe, however, that it gives essential insights into a very important impact of the Internet, and is worthy reading for all interested in that impact. Any work incorporating a large number of graphics, must meet additional tests for a reader, of course. Such books are invariably expensive, though the 29.95 cost of this work puts it well toward the low end of the ""coffee table"" genre. The graphics are, however, beautiful and highly detailed...For a full review see Interface, Volume 5, Issue 2."
4,My hands are warm!,These were easy to install (2 hours). I installed them on a Buell Ulysses. They take about 10 minutes to warm up and then get hot! 34 was my coldest but winter is still here. I turn them on high until they warm up then drop them to low. Works Great!!!!
3,OK...but not believable,"On what planet would a Royal Prince propose to a woman he met an hour ago! Then after a week of marriage, decides to give her up because he cares for her and wants to set her free! This stretches my imagination TOO far. The mystery of sister Victorias kidnapping, and introducing Rachels daughter Carly were very enjoyable. The lead-in to the next book was promising. This 'Royally Wed' series has been REALLY good,(for the most part). I would recommend reading the whole group!"
5,Canon scanner is a big winner,"At twice the price it would be hard to imagine being able to match this piece of equipment. It is simple to operate, and scans photos, slides, and negatives with great detail and precision. It comes with excellent software, including Photoshop Elements (v.4), and Photo Sudio 5.5. This was a great upgrade at a bargain price."
1,Terrible movie.,"I could not stand the main character in this movie, all she did was stomp around and whine about every little thing. If this character were a real person she would have been dumped repeatedly,she is extremely overly dramatic and irritating. I normally love sappy movies like this one, but I just couldn't get past her personality it was terrible. Side note: Men will hate this movie."
3,Three men to choose from and yet I think she picked the wrong one :),I like this movie though I find the guy she eventually picks very annoying. I want the hero to be likeable and I just found his chatter very annoying but then again if he'd be sauve and well Matthew McConaughey or the hero's best friend. Also he didn't seem to get her yet the young girl under her charge seemed way smarter.
4,2 seasons max,"More like golf balls with some colored bands. They have some soft plastic on the bottom that will protect kids heads if hit, but won't expect them to last more than 2 seasons."
2,"DO NOT BUY the F11, save your money and buy a cheaper model","The reason I spent the extra money on the F11 was because of the ability to track and store you workouts on your computer. There is no stand alone software, you need to create an account on the Polar.fi website and upload your workouts. The way you upload is via a microphone connected to your computer, as a small speaker in the watch makes a buzzing noise. The Polar website is VERY poorly designed, and often doesn't work ( you can not log in). Even if you do log in, the usability is often not working. After spending an hour, and using a mic, and then trying a headset, I was unable to upload date.In short DO NOT BUY the F11, save your money and buy a cheaper model.On the positive side, the heart rate monitor seems to work fine, and there is a slightly more comfortable chest strap."
1,The Polar F11 is Only Useful to Jocks,"I was told by a trainer that this is a great piece of equipment. If you already know heart monitors it might be a good choice, I bought it and the list of things one has to do to use it seems to never end. When I go the the gym I hold onto a part of the exercise equipment and it says what range I am in. I am looking for the same ease of use in a heart rate monitor. I tried to contact customer service with no luck. The P-11 is useless to me. Some day I hope to find a real heart rate monitor."
1,totally displeased with this item,Being a longtime user of Logitech products and having used The V20 notebook speakers I thought the V10's would be a good set of speakers for my laptop. But I was totally wrong! They didn't even sound as good as the built in speakers do. I was so displeased that I returned them the same day I received them.The $15.00 or so more that the V20 speakers cost is completely worth it if one wants any amount of bass.
3,not too bad .. not too good .. read on,"hello everyone ...i bought these two speakers coz i do presentations and training for company professionals ...i think for the price of these two speakers, the deal is about right ..the volume of the speakers is not good for big room ... however, for small room its enoughone draw back on these speakers is that they do NOT stand up properly .. they easily flip or fall to the side .. i wish they can make the base a bit sturdier ... however, if you are ok to lay them down on the side, then you are good to goinstalling them is a piece of cake .. and you can be up and running in minutes"
4,Vista Certified laptop USB speakers,"I use these speakers on two laptops,a Acer with Vista Home Premium and a Toshiba with Vista Home Basic. Both computers recognized the speakers immediately. The speakers work very well, and they have given me no trouble at all. Again, these speakers are certified for Windows Vista."
1,arrived broken,"I ordered 2 of these as gifts and the little one, arrived broken. Ordered ahead and by the time I was giving the gift, the return window had closed and she opened it and it was broken. This is why, sometimes it easier and better to shop at a local store."
5,Perfect Fit,"After forty plus years, this material remains timeless, as a good classic ought. It's repeatedly listenable; reveals something new every time; has many moments one awaits with anticipation. The Gershwins will continue to get ever greater in apprehension of their place in Music as time goes by. Everybody takes a crack at interpreting the Gershwins, but not even Ella nor Sassy nail it like Chris Connor has."
5,Lived up to expectations!,"After reading all of the posted reviews i decided to buy it. Wow, everyone who gave it 5 stars was right. This CD could pretty much be played in any atmosphere, a party, a club... wherever... It is so good that people will change themselves in order to like it. Some people commented that the songs vary too much, well... In response to that I would like to say that the gaps and variations between songs prove to make the music stand out even more from one track to the next. I fully reccomend this track to anyone who is having doubts... And even if you don't like it at first... Listen to it another time and you will find whatever it is you missed the first time! :)"
4,I think the words are,"Someone couldn't figure out the words to 9pm. I believe its something like ""Till I Come, change it and sing"""
3,Not bad.,"Now I bought this cd after hearing 9PM. ATB has some great stuff on this record. My biggest complaint with this album though, is that it can't be listened to as an album. If you are DJing a party I highly recommend this album to throw in a couple of his tunes but don't use too many because you might get people wondering if you already played that song. While his sound is unique, all of his songs have the same sound. As a whole album, it is very repetitive, the one thing that turns people away from electronic music. I would like to see him stray from his blueprint every now and again. He could be much greater."
4,TILL I COME!,"Wow! This has got to be one of the most exhaustive searches that I have ever conducted in my life! I first heard the song in a nightclub in Mexico in early '99. Amazingly enough all new european music hits Mexico and South America before the U.S.! I don't know why, but that's the way it is. So I heard the song, but everytime I was talking to a DJ, I forgot to ask about the artist. Then one day I was at house party in the U.S. where the DJ played the song, I could not believe it! I asked him what it was, and the name was bogus, it was an illegal CD. Months later, ATB hit in the U.S. in various compilation albums. Finally found ""9pm Till I Come""....Awesome song, and this CD pretty good, it's not hardcore though....More of a chill sound. All the songs are different, so I do recommend this one!"
2,"Buy the single for ""9pm"" instead","After hearing ""9PM (till I come)"" about a dozen times on the radio, I decided to shell out for the album, hoping it would be as good as the single. Some of the songs are catchy, but the whole trippy-Robert Miles thing grows old fast. ""Too Much Rain"" is practically laughable. Does anyone know what the woman is singing on ""9PM (till I come)"" besides the ""till I come"" part? None of my friends and I can figure it out!"
5,Be careful which reviews you read!,"Many of the reviews below give away some BIG storyline surprises. Do yourself a favor and read carefully.This book is Shatner's strongest yet, and thankfully leaves the door open for more James T. Kirk in the future. Quick summary, this ties the previous 2 books together very well, and I cannot think of any unanswered questions from the first 2 books. I read the entire book in 1 sitting, which is rare (and difficult these days) to do. 1 major fault is the simple fact that if you haven't read the first 2 books, you'll have a little trouble following the 3rd installment, and much of the suspense from the first 2 will be out the window if they are read out of order.The combination of Shatner (who knows Kirk better than the guy who portrayed him) and the Reeves-Stevens (intricate knowledge of the ST Universe) makes for a great Trek novel. Hopefully there will be more to come..."
3,Broken :(,"I purchased this as a gift to my fiance as he recently took a job out of state. He loved the gift and initally I was very happy with the purchase. However, the second time I wore my half the chain(the smaller of the two) it completely snapped. I was very disappointed and am now searching for a replacement chain."
5,I love it!,"This is a great product. The photo doesn't do it justice. It's about the size of a penny when put together, and it's beautifully detailed and very shiny. I've worn it almost everyday for a month and it's (the chain/coin) yet to break or change color at all. The necklace itself came in a nice box and jewelry bag, each half of the coin individually wrapped up so as not to scratch.I would definitely recommend this item. I absolutely love mine, and I love the message it send out and what it symbolizes. A great and meaningful gift for a couple that spends a lot of time apart."
5,Cool,Very good anniversary gift my wife loved it as do I. I would recommend this to anyone interested in getting this as a gift.
4,A Spanish Alternative,"This movie was both insightful and inspiring. More often than not, gay media tends to focus on the image conscious club kids, or the gym bunnies, and in Bear Cub it touches on another side of the LGBT community: the bears. The film itself is deep and touches on issues from psychological welfare, kids in the gay community and health issues facing today's queer community. The only thing restricting this movie to a 4 star and not a 5 star is the subtitles. I LOVE subtitled movies, but the subtitles in this one move VERY FAST. I literally had to pause the movie a few times to catch up. This draws away from the movie if you need to read all of them. However, this movie was moving enough to make up for the execution of the DVD features."
3,DIRTY HARRIET,"Clint Eastwood's striking daughter Alison is kind of a ""dirty Harriett"" in this eerie serial killer thriller. She plays a cop who doesn't mind stooping to illegal deeds to get her man. She's on the trail of a serial killer who is rituallistically killing off members of a local Catholic church. Her partner, writer Nicholas Cellici, is a stalwart man who tries to get his partner to play things a little more by the book. A top billed Judd Nelson fills out the useless role of an FBI priest (?) who is called in to explain the mysterious symbolism, and John Rhys-Davies plays a deaf priest who knows more about the murders than he's letting on. Filmed in a snowstorm in Saskatchewan, THE LOST ANGEL has a compelling sense of doom and Eastwood is quite fetching in her lead role. The identity of the serial killer took me by surprise, too. Not a classic but well done for its genre."
5,True to life,"As a Probation Officer in Calif. I was thrilled to read an accurate account of what a probation officer does. I have never encountered the personal threats or violence, but I know its always a step away. This is a great read for anyone interested in gangs or the field of probation work."
5,Grace in the Storm,"Thank you Jan for your sensitive, thoughtful approach to the subject of pain. You have taught us how to apply God's Word to our hurting hearts and showed us His Love is ever present. It is in the midst of the catastrophe that His Love is more and more evident and you have given us the tools to see Him more clearly."
4,The Parade. Terrorizin' my friends.,"From the minute I heard the catchy new offering from 'The Parade' I was hooked. I first heard it on the 'Box' music channel and went around singing it for days afterwards annoying all my friends, who mostly didn't know it. I love the song because it is so catchy, the kind of tune that gets stuck in your head, but i don't think it will be the kind of song that will 'terrorize' the charts and make it to number one. I think it is probably a bit too 'alternative' to be a big hit. I think the Video makes the song, with its Retro styling, and the female singer sitting in one of those groovy bubble chairs that hangs from the ceiling. Plus, the lead singer, who I think may be called Dominic (?) is really cute! Anyway, I think it is a great song. Go buy it - NOW!"
4,Mobile Church For E.P.I.C. Times,"In his book ""A Mobile Church For E.P.I.C. Times,"" Fred Peatross challenges the church to stop running in place and get in the motion of mission."
3,cover sounds,"""14 Princess Princess children"" is a selection of hits by the J-pop group Princess Princess covered by other artists. On the whole I found it a bit disappointing as it seemed some of the acts were forcing the vocals. By far my favorite selection is Nana Kitade's cover of ""Kiss"". It has a good arrangement and Miss Kitade does not force the vocals; her singing seems natural. While hard-core Puri-Puri followers may not favor the covers, it does present a different look at their great music."
1,Depressing......,"A book about women who become ""working girls""....the part about Helen, whose mentally challenged, is just sad and sick......put the book away half-way through. It was just too depressing."
2,What was the point?,"I could barely get through this book. I found myself speed reading halfway through just to get a sense of completion.I do not understand the point of this story. Yes, they were prostitutes, yes they had painful life and familial experiences but this book was just a narration - no story, nothing to sink your teeth into.What a disappointment. I am just glad it was a library book and I did not spend my precious dollars."
1,This does NOT work !,"This product is a POS. It did fit in my phone, but it would not work. I tried several times, online, offline, updates, different computers, phone on, phone off. NOTHING worked. I'm glad I only lost the $8 total or whatever it cost me. I am not pleased in any way and I wouldn't even rate it the one star if I had the choice."
1,Didn't work with the cell phone Motorola V300,I tried all the suggestions was not able to get the pictures out of my Motorola V300.Didn't test it in other models
4,Great fit for large sedan windows you don't want to get too dark,Have used these for years as friends you have the coatings on their windows are too dark/disorienting for me. They also come off easily for car washes.
2,Disappointing,"I was in search of light summer reading, but found this book to be far too light for my taste. Characters were never in quite the same place as where I last left them (""Cheyney"" floats through this story like ""Tinkerbelle"" -- what's up with that?), and personalities were virtually nonexistant. Additionally, the compromising situations the characters find themselves in were exactly that -- situations that compromised the integrity and value of the story. I'm sorry because I really wanted to like this little story."
2,2.5 stars would be better though..,"There's nothing wrong with the series, just that it isn't very exciting. The plot remains monotonous and there's never really a climax or ending. The story begins with three sisters and a god who is bonded to them, and it ends that way too. Nothing extraordinary happens, there's no war, no apocalypse, just the ordinary lives of the girls and their god."
1,DID NOT WORK !!!!,"I have an Emerson LCD TV manufactured in 2001, I have now tried 5 universal remotes and nothing will program to the TV. I tried this Miracle Remote and same old story, did not work at all. Return and shipping was very prompt and easy though."
1,Disappointment,This was a disappointment. They should say in the product information that it is only good for TVs made after 1997. The set I have is older and I was hopeful this product would solve my problem.
1,NOT FOR USE ON HDTV,"I tried this on two Sylvania HDTV's without sucess. It apparently works on Analog TV's manufactured after 2000. The cost of returning this item including postage, time and gas was almost as much as I paid for it."
3,Classy appearance but...,All in all a wonderful watch with typical Seiko high quality. My only caution is that the 'shimmery' dial background makes it very difficult to read the hands in certain light conditions.
3,Not for lefties!,"The machine did a good job, but....it was a lot heavier than I expected and is not usable by left-handed people. Both the button and trigger must be pressed at the same time to operate the machine, it MUST be held in the right hand to reach them. I was able to do it, but my arm and wrist were VERY sore by the end of the job."
5,"LITTLE, BUT TOUGH","I LOVE THIS LITTLE MACHINE.EATS THROUGH SNOW. NOT ICE. SMILEONCE I SHOVELED FOR FOUR HOURS AND WAS SO BENT I DREADED SEEING SNOW AGAIN.BOUGHT THIS LITTLE BABY AND NOW IT IS FUN TO WATCH THAT SNOW BLOW UP 20 FEET IN THE AIR. MY DOGS LOVE IT TOO. WHAT IS NEAT IS THAT NOW I JUST CLEAR A PATH IN EACH DIRECTION... ONE TO THE GRASS, ONE TO THE CARS, ONE TO THE MAIL BOX, AND ONE FOR THE POST MAN. THEN I PUT DOWN ROCK SALT OR ICE MELT. THIS YEAR IT TOOK ME LESS THAN AN HALF AN HOUR TO DO IT ALL... EVEN THE BACK YARD.THREE PATHWAYS FOR THE DOGS TO RUN. WELL WE HAVE ONE WHO DOESN'T LIKE TO GET HIS FEET WET. SO THOSE PATHS REALLY HELPED. THANKS."
5,Perfect for snow,"Having a small driveway and sidwalk, I didn't want to spend hundreds for a new snow blower. I purchased this item and for snow, it performs flawlessly.I have used it for anything from 1 inch to 8 inch storms and it displaced the white stuff 15 - 20 feet. Easy to use, starts right up. I found myself placing a 100 foot heavy duty extension cord on a garden hose hanger, right inside the garage door. When it snows, I just plug and go.You can litterally toss your snow shovel out. I have a bad back, and I feel no strain when using this unit. I have to admit I never used it for a broom, but as stated, for snow it's a win, win."
3,toro snow blower,"This item is fine for small driveways. One problem I had was if the snow froze rained on etc, you have a real problem. Also the weight of the blower plus you having to push,can be very tiring. If the manufacturer had put some type of wheels on it to take the weight, then all you have to do is push, it will in my estimation work better. For snow deeper than 6 inches, I suggest you find another type of machine."
3,Toro Power Shovel 7.5 Amp Snow Thrower/Electric Broom #38360,I bought this as a gift...my uncle says it works just fine.
3,Not quite a snow blower,"If you've ever used a ""real"" snow blower, then this is a toy. It works fairly well on new snow up to about 8"". If the snow is deeper and you have to reduce the depth by layers, it will wear you out holding the Toro Power Shovel up. And if the snow has sat for a few days and is compressed, it takes a long time. It does work well when I get right on a new snowfall and before it gets too deep. I should point out that my decks are not accessible for my Honda, so this is a good compromise."
4,Pretty good,"Very powerful, throws the snow out a considerable distance, only negative is that unlike the Toro 1800, you can not direct which direction to throw the snow"
1,WHAT SHOVEL ??????????,"I am writing to let you know that I am very disatisfied with the customer service at Amazon. I ordered this shovel on Dec 9th,2003 and they said that they would ship it out in two days. Two weeks later I checked out where my order was and the shovel was dated to ship on Dec 10th, 2004!!! I repeatedly tried to get in touch with Amazon to no avail. Even though they stated that they would return my answer in 2 days by e-mail. No such luck, I asked for a phone, and by the way there is no where to reach these people. So I am writing to say the shovel was probably a great buy, but with the service from Amazon you'll never know.ThanksA disgrunted customer"
3,Murder in Vegas,I purchased this book because I love the writing of Michael Connelly amd didn't realize that it was the work of multiple mystery writers.
1,Not as pictured.,"The item was not as pictured. I could not use the item, but it cost more to return than I paid. I would not order from this vendor again."
