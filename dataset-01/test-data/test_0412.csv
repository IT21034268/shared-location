2,Average MM Book meant for starters,"This book is a good introduction for people who are planning to start a career in SAP MM from a functional stand point. It however just scans the basics which I felt was very insufficient both from the certification as well as the interview perspective. Again, the way the author has described those answers in english is very unsatisfactory for a book that costs so much. I would have rated the book at 3 if the price was brought down to somewhere between 20 to 25 dollars."
2,"Is it a drill? Is it a smoke machine? No, it's BOTH!","After 2 years of relatively heavy home use, I began to notice an odor of burning electrical ""something"" whenever I used this drill. Shortly after that, the drill would slow down quickly, even after a full charge, and smoke began to pour from the vent slots at its back end. I haven't had the ambition to disassemble it to see what went so horribly wrong. Summary: It worked great, until the Day of Bad Smells. I have a corded Skil hand drill that's almost 40 years old, and never had a problem with it. I was hoping this cordless would give the same service, but as with everything else these days, ""they don't make 'em like they used to...""."
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!,"I just fell in love with Livy Two and the Weems family. Livy Two is the kind of girl you want to be your best friend. She's smart, she listens and she loves her little sister Gentle more than anything. She also has great hiding places to listen in on conversations. I found myself laughing at the stuff Emmett (Livy Two's older brother who can't wait to leave the Holler) and crying over Louise's (her artist sister) description of colors to Gentle. Each paragraph held surprises. It's the kind of book you want to curl up with and read ALL DAY LONG. Gentle's Holler has the kind of truth and humor that both kids and adults relate to. There are so many distinct voices. I could go on and on. Read this book! You will love it!!!!!!"
4,No Streaks,Finally something that cleans without leaving streaks. I like the sterile packaging and the ease of use.
5,NIkon Moist Lens Cleaner Cloths,"This item is very well built, and works great with the Nikon Camera it was purchased to support. I recommend this item"
4,Wonderful gardening book to keep,This is another terrific Pamela Crawford book especially for those who live in South Florida. The techniques shown for maintaining container plants are detailed and easy to follow. She shows how to create container arrangements that are both simple and as beautiful as you'd see at a florist.The photos are a big help and the information given is chock full of facts worth knowing.
1,Charger kills batteries. Works as designed.,"Charger is very cheap and can very easily kill the batteries. It doesn't appear the manufacturer is serious about this tool. So why should we be? It's a shame. I didn't hate the thing while it worked. For my money, I am going with the Milwauke M18 drill/impact driver set -- great deal here on Amazon, btw."
3,Not Enough Numbers,"As I understand it, one of the main premises of the South Beach Diet, is that its not just the amount of carbohydrates and fat that you eat that is important, but which fat (good or bad fats) and which carbohydrates (lower glycemic index).Thus, I was sutprised to find that the book did not break down the fat in each food by type of fat (saturated, trans, mono-unsat...), and simply listed the aggregate amount. Similarly, it lists the carbohydrates (separating out sugars), but not the glycemic index.I'm a scientific person and was hoping to find more useful numbers in a book that almost entirely consists of numbers."
3,Helpful but there's better out there...,"This guide seemed like the answer to my needs. I wanted something I could keep in the car as a guide for when I go shopping or to restaurants. However, it's failing in many respects.The guide doesn't give you actual net carb counts for items. Instead, it just rates them on good/average/poor, etc. There's no glycemic index indication or rating. The information for restaurants is very general. I would have liked to have seen charts for popular fast food chains, for example. And given that this is a South Beach branded guide, why oh why doesn't it mark each item with what phase it's acceptable for?There are plenty of better pocket guides out there. I'd recommend getting an up-to-date version of another guide instead. This one just seems to be capitalizing on a trend without actually providing useful information."
4,"Flimsier than a real license plate, but fun for decorating","Got this for my stepsister for Christmas. She wants it for a decoration for her room. It's good for that purpose, but is flimsier than a real license plate."
3,Not totally convinced,"Must confess I haven't listened to this since I ditched my turntable and lost the ability to play the vinyl. This is Andrew Gold's attempt to be a rocker. My problem with it is that, although it's catchy and nicely done (as you'd expect), there's no real change of pace throughout. Thing is, if you're into loud rock music, you probably wouldn't want to listen to Andrew Gold anyway, and if you're into Andrew Gold, you probably wouldn't want to listen to loud rock music.My advice, unless you're a completist, is to get ALL THIS AND HEAVEN TOO, or THE SPENCE MANOR SUITE first."
2,his weakest of the four,"This is a rockier album. Andrew Gold was best known, and rightly so, for his ballads and there are none here. For some reason, he felt people wanted to hear a rockier side to him, and it hardly works, in my opinion. I think to the first three albums and stand out tracks come to mind. This is just poor middle of the road rock."
5,Really great story.,This is a great book with a great story. It will have you laughing and completely envisioning each event that takes place. Great story!!!
1,Terrible Quality Loppers,"To start, after about five times use I had to replace a bolt. Then alll of the nuts holding the head together consistently tried to fall off. Plus, about everyother time you try to cut something over two inches in diameter, the handels come together smashing your fingers. Do not buy these."
3,Patterson Disappoints,"This headline is becoming far too frequent.Once a big fan of Patterson books, I am now too often disappointed. I found this book to be a slow read with a mediocre story line and plot.C'mon James, let's go back to good Alex Cross books once again"
4,Good Music,I am not really a big guitar fan but I really enjoy this CD. The vocal tracks are really nice - especially #1 and #5. Perfect for listening to in the car or while chillin with a glass of wine and ur sweetie.
2,WHERE'S THE BEEF?,".Most smooth jazz stuff doesn't have great melodies...just simply ditties turned into, or manufactured into tunes...Keep the sound if you want, but try some cal tjader tunes, or Harold Arlen, or famous funk tunes, etc. Maybe the problem is that one has to pay to use these...but isn't it based on how many CD's sell anyway? I can't distinguish most smooth jazz tunes from each other, and I really don't think they allow the players to play their best ideas in solos. Try some Ellington tunes, or Waits tunes like Barber Shop, or Crusaders stuff, or Les McCann things...All Things Shining...."
2,shut up,"Frank Zappa had a title that is apt for this Norman Brown cd;SHUT UP & play your GUITAR ! Pop arrangements, lots of vocals, and drum machine. No Jazz here. He is an awesome guitar player, and I really like his earlier cd's. Do yourself a favor and skip this cd."
2,Not his best work!!!,It seems as though the smooth jazz artist are trying to attract the r & b listener. The cd was done in poor taste and the songs lack creativity as well originality. Too many vocals. I would rather here him play his wonderful guitar. I love Norman Brown but it seems as though he just through this together.
3,Half of the History of Affirmative Action,"I thought this was an interesting book, particularly in its coverage of the early days of affirmative action, before the Kennedy years. The narrative of the later years tended to bog down in the detail and was frankly less readable. What was most lacking in the book, however, was any real coverage of the effects, positive and negative, of affirmative action and of the cynical polititization of affirmative action. This is part of the history, and its absence makes this only a 50 percent effort."
5,a wee bit of heaven...,"i think that the only way (other than to buy this single) to get this song is to buy the greatest hits album - also an import. the song is worth it.i picked this up in paris and there is an another single cd (that i purchased as well) that has some different mixes. this one, however, has the video - a great bonus for those of us in the states who don't usually see texas on our local music video station.but enough about the details, what about the song... well, it's worth it. lush, melodic - it showcases sharleen's voice wonderful. the song is both danceable and background. makes for a wonderful early morning play as it will get you in the mood to have a good day. the remix on this single is similar to the single version, but longer. not as different as the remixes on the other cd single. the lennon tribute is good, but not one that i expect to find myself playing.this cd is worth the purchase price for just the song, but the included video makes it a bargain. treat yourself."
5,Lighting The Way,"Great book to help those share their faith. I loved the practical ideas, and found the daily format easy to use."
4,Exciting and Entertaining,"Actually this is the first of Ken Follett's book that I read. I just couldn't put it down.It's ashame that the story is a bit short, and but it served as a wonderful reading material for a short weekend break!I getting some more of Follett....."
4,enjoy reading about the resistance,"as usual Ken Follett delivers a great story. I especially enjoyed the fact that women played a great part this time--and not the barbie, bimbo, or subservant wife types."
4,Ken Follet Does it Again,"If it was possible, I would have given it a 4.5 star. While I was somewhat disappointed with his Code To Zero, Ken Follet is back doing what he know best - writing thrillers about the Second World War. Flick, the main heroine is a strongly sketched character, the portrayals of Ruby, Helen and the others are also well developed. There are plenty of twists and turns and breath stopping suspense in the plot to keep one hooked. If there is one shortcoming, it is in some of the incidents being too unbelievable in extremes - sometimes it is too easy for the jackdaws and sometimes too difficult. However, it is the element of suspense -the way Dieter Franck is always on Flick's trail, but she just about manages to stay one step ahead - kept me reading late into the night."
4,An excellent read,"I wasn't planning to review this book, but I decided I had to when I saw one reviewer mention that the sex diluted the story. That's absolutely ridiculous! There's one particularly descriptive scene, but other than that it does nothing to hamper the plot.This book was highly enjoyable. I found myself reading chapter after chapter even after I had decided to stop reading for the night."
4,Jackdaws,"""Jackdaws"" is a good read. I like a book with strong women that are not victims. The book is paced well and supplies surprises, suspense with a little romance thrown in. I would definitely recommend ""Jackdaws."""
2,MR. FOLLET CAN DO BETTER,"From a Ken Follett fan of years, the last two books by Mr. Follett have been ridiculous. When he's on he's really on but when he's not it's a waste of money. This book, much like the last one, has a very predictable plot, albeit hard to believe, and so disappointing. Still hoping to see another good book from him."
3,I'm over this whole Follett thing.,"This book was just OK. Its not ""thrilling"", there's very little in the way of suspensethats not totally predictable, and its written at a 5th grade level. I expected more andgot less.Follett was once one of my favorite authors but he seems to have gone the way of so manyothers carried by ghostwriters and driven by a paycheck."
4,WWII by Ken Follett,"I would recommend this book for anyone interested in WWII, especially the areas we don't often hear about, i.e.. women pilots, spies etc. And written by Ken Follett is an additional plus!"
2,Jackdaws Ken Follett,I love Ken follet books but this one was missing something. I read half of it maybe I'll pick it up again someday.
4,Jackdaws,"This is a great story of the French resistance just prior to D-day. The author was able to weave a true story of sabotage around the personal lives of British intelligence agents and the French resistance. Included are the German counter-intelligence agents who are portrayed in a very complex manor. Men who like to torture people and then felt sorry that they had to do this to do their jobs. To clarify, they felt sorry for themselves not their victims. The author makes no mistakes that these are very sick men. If you like Ken Follet then you will really enjoy Jackdaws as it brings the British intelligence service to life."
5,Jackdaws,"I loved this book. This book was based on actual events. I can't begin to guess the female spy that the character ""Flick"" represented. There were numerous times during WW II, that extraordinary events occurred involving female spies in France. A sudden opportunity would arise to gather information or to remove someone from the Gestopo. There were several daring female agents that served during this time. Many of the records for the SOE were sealed for many years, and others were actually destroyed at the end of the war. This book was exciting action at its best. One of the most interesting thing was how women went outside of the home and placed themselves in danger. This was during a time period when women did not work outside the home. However, England was literally imploding, because the men were fighting outside the country and women had to pick up the slack in factories, military, working the farms, and of course as spies. I could not put this book down."
2,Boring.,"I was so excited about getting this book after reading so many wonderful reviews, but I found it so hard to finish. I read 2-4 books a week, and I have to admit once I put this book down, I could not remember one thing notable about it. Use your valuable time reading something more interesting!"
4,"Like his other books, only more so","Follett is no wordsmith, but he is a talented storyteller. The major characters show modest character development, but the reader can empathize with them quite easily. If you liked ""Eye of the Needle"" this is definitely worth the read. The book is suspenseful in the same fashion, but the key difference: instead of the good guy chasing the bad guy to prevent a horrible incident, it's the bad guy chasing the good guy. The book is a breeze to read and was very enjoyable. If you are not familiar w/ Follett, he writes in the fashion of Grisham and Crichton - an action screenplay loosely disguised as a novel. As for the ""sex"" in the book, it did not disrupt the plot, and was not out of the ordinary for this type of ""bestseller."" The Modigliani Scandal, by Follett, was more graphic, and that book was written over 15 years ago."
1,Horror show,I am not sure who this book is written for.If I were a medical or nursing student it would be too simple with not enough information and as a layperson it assumes I know a lot of medical words when in reality I would need a medical dictionary just to get through it.Useless
2,Where's the ending?,"As I was dwindling down to the last few pages, I wondered howthe author would wrap up this story. When I finished the book,I checked to see if some pages were torn out at the end. Howcould any author end a novel in this manner is beyond me.Does anyone know if a sequel was published?"
1,Absolutely...,"The ghostwriter is wise in avoiding identification. I bought this book on impulse at an airport bookstore, thinking it would provide me entertainment on a long flight. It is quite possibly the worst book that I've ever read. The storyline is predictable, the editing is horrible, the characters are unbelievable, and much of the story is left unresolved. The description on the back of the book does not even acccurately describe the premise! I cannot believe that I wasted my money and my time on this book. Ghostwriter, please stop writing as the late Harold Robbins - identify yourself so that we can avoid unwittingly purchasing one of your books. Readers, beware of this book. Do not pay money for it, don't check it out of the library, don't borrow it from your friends. I put mine into the recycle bin, hoping that it will at least have a decent future in another form."
5,Amazon - A wonderful bar of soap!,"I have fallen in love with this soap. My hands are so soft ( I use it in my bathroom for washing my hands). And I love the slight honey smell! Also, it is an extremely affordable bar of soap that lasts a long time. I would recommend this bar to anyone who wants to soften their hands."
3,informative but slightly disjointed,"Compared to Frederick Douglass's narrative, Ben Franklin's autobiography does not flow as smoothly. Franklin's work, although very interesting, does not draw the reader into his life and his thoughts. Perhaps the only intent of the autobiography was to inform, not to entertain, the reader."
5,A Treasure from the BargainTable,"Who knew that this gemstone of a book was found on the bargain table at a local bookstore? I was pleasantly surprised in the beginning, by the time I finished, it it had easily touched thousands of layers of my skin. Great story, great plot, worth looking for!!! FIVE STARS."
2,Carver is no Chekhov.,"What I can't understand is not the revered tedium of Raymond Carver, but how Robert Altman managed to use this sterile material to create one of the great, rich tragicomic masterpieces of the last twenty years. The closing story here, about the death of Chekhov, is an attempt to extend his range, but the flat biographical style, the phoney insertions of 'meaningful' details and 'significant' events, the clumsy gropings for understated emotion, are quite intolerable."
4,Great Fan - No Screws Included,Fan works great - installed on a Sabertooth P67 Motherboard - did not include the screws which is why I gave the 4 stars. To use the motherboard screws I had to drill down the mounting holes so the shorter screws would work.
5,I had to have this book for myself!,"I love this book so much, I had to buy a copy for myself. I kept checking it out of the library and keeping it too long and paying fines, until I finally decided to just pay one time and have it forever.Marguerite Henry is such and awesome artist and storyteller. I love this one about birds and the one called Album of Dogs, too. I'm an animal lover who doesn't overdo it. I don't allow animals in our house, but I wouldn't mind having an outside dog. I do like to watch the birds at our feeder, and I like to find out what I can about them. I don't go crazy with it, but one resource that helps me learn more about the different birds is this book by Marguerite Henry. Her stories are captivating, and her pictures are beautiful. And the whole thing is educational. To me, that's an unbeatable combination!"
1,Inaccurate description of this book on Amazon,"B a d description of this book on Amazon. It goes... ""Cricket Explained offers the sports enthusiast a user-friendly introduction to baseball's British cousin, a game that shares with America's national pastime...""America may be a great country but doesn't mean every game should be explained in American angle or view point.British existed long before Americas and it would be silly to call Cricket as ""baseball's British cousin"" despite the similarities. Rather we might say ""baseball is a derivative of cricket!"". The English started playing cricket in 16th century. The Colonies declared independence in 1776."
4,It's good to keep him closed up@,"The Catapillar is cute, and goes cute in his room which is bug themed. But it's size in impratical for him to play with at such a young age. But, it's cool anyway."
3,Excellent book / Arrogant seller,"Excellent book, arrived in good time. However, if the seller becomes very defensive is ask any question about the arrival time."
4,Serial,"I think this is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It is not slap-stick, but a good satire of the 80's life style of California."
4,Tubular Bells meets Ibiza drum'n'bass,"Unlike the previous two efforts, TB3 is a very 'contemporary' album. Some drum'n'bass, some spacey Orb influenced stuff - and some classical Spanish guitar. The ideal 'driving' album for 1998."
3,Mike goes Techno-pop,"I like techno-pop and Mike Oldfield is my favorite composer so I found this album quite interesting. I was slightly dissappointed as two of my favorite elements of Tubular Bells -the variety of instruments, and the unique introductions of the instruments were missing. The themes are still there in much diffent format so it still belongs in the Tunular Bells series. This album should attract a new flock of fans to Oldfield. Old faithfuls like myself will still enjoy it because it's a new variation for Oldfield."
4,Not one of his best but....,"On first listen, I was ready to take this to the used CD shop. However, repeated listenings have warmed me to it, particularly the driving finale. Oldfield has added new elements to the TB series while discarding some of the older familiar ones. Don't give up on this one after only one listen...give it a few spins. You'll be glad you did."
3,The Return...,"Well.This is it eh?Tubular Bells 3!Not so stunning as TB2 but good.I enjoyed track no7 ""Man In The Rain"" featuring the gorgeous vocals of Cara.In my hometown this song is very popular,and the CD is in the 10 most wanted cd's of the last 2 years.For all of you guys i think this is something you should listen.."
2,A dissapointment...,"Mike Oldfield is really one of a kind, but this albume is Mike trying to please the ""House"" & ""Dance"" audience... I hope his next release will have the qualities of the older albums..."
1,Buy something else,"This product doesn't live up to the KitchenAid name. Less than six months and it's broken. The packaging said it was dishwasher safe. The only problem with that is that it has small holes on the bottom of the bin which fill up with the dishwasher water. Needless to say when I take it out of the dishwasher, all of the dirty water comes out of the cylinder from the holes on the bottom. It's really gross."
5,great purchase!,i needed this book for my college algebra class and was so pleased to find it at such a great price...thanks!
3,"Great book overall, but I think a few answers were wrong...","I wanted to confirm on the website that this book was as good as it appears. Overall, I got so much from the book - from basic algebra to complicated fractions and all of those polynomials.However, I did find a small handful of answers - like one out of a hundred, when I got all of the answers right - just one would be wrong according to the key. I would rework the problem over and over, and even substituted the book's answer and it still came off wrong. Did anyone else notice that? So I'm a little trepid in totally recommending this book.It would have been better, I agree had the authors explain how they got their answers."
2,Good Content - Zero Support,"Watched the video and found it very informative. Drills were well explained. However; there was no suggestions as to how often to do them, how many reps to perform, or any other pertinent info. Went to their website twice and asked for assistance. No response at all. Has been several weeks now. Don't think it's coming."
5,Not a bad song on the entire cd @}->---,"Considering I love all of these songs, it's hard to choose my favourites. I've loved these guys since forever and they are amazingly talented and underrated. They sound so good together and sing with a lot of feeling and emotion and there is some great bedroom songs here.Apart from the obvious Crazy and All My Life, I love Through Heavens Eyes, Last Nights Letter and Down For Life. I've yet to hear a song of theirs that I haven't liked. This is a terrific cd for anyone who is either a fan of theirs, or if you want to hear a sampling of their best work. It's a gorgeous cd and lots of sensual music. I could melt just listening to them croon. I highly recommend this to all R&B; fans."
4,Not Sure They Are Any Better Quality Wise But...,"...they are sure a lot easier to put on and take off. The NUT alone is why I use these filters. Got really tired of crumpled cans and scrapped knuckles, using a box end wrench that is pre-fitted to the nut makes working with these filters well worth the extra money. Just hope they are as good as they advertise them to be quality wise because they are the only ones that I will use...."
1,Horrible dust and what I find a sickening smell.,"The clumping works well, but the fine dust everyplace is incredible. It smears when you try to clean it up and it gets everyplace. It's made a mess of my downstairs and one just can't clean enough to get rid of it ... I can't recommend this product and that is why I gave it a one star, the horrific dust. And when you clean up the dust you get the cat litter smell on your hands and all of the items you're trying to remove the dust from. Also, it gets into your respiratory system as you clean and in my case my allergies start up."
5,Very Solid Album,"I've been a fan of Thrice for a while now. I've always been more keen to their heavier stuff rather than their softer stuff, but I when I heard Dustin Kensrue's solo effort, I immediately fell in love with it. The first song I heard, is ironically enough the first song on the album, ""I Knew You Before."" I knew Thrice was going in new directions with ""Vheissu,"" but I never expeected this. It was a totally enthralled by the music and vocals. It's beautiful folk rock in the raw. Anyone, who likes music in general should enjoy this album.Key Tracks:I Knew You Before - song about a good girl gone bad, great lyricsPistol - ballad about Dustin's wife, great harmonicaPlease Come Home - beautiful ballad that seems to be an homage to the Bible story of the Prodigal SonBlood and Wine - 100% raw acoustic rampage, very much like Johnny CashBlanket of Ghosts - just a great song with great lyrics"
4,"Simple, but important wisdom","Simple stories that bring home the importance of saving, wise investing, and living within your means. I've listened to it twice and am now loaning it to my friends. I wish I could get my kids to listen to it..."
1,Frustrating,"This DVD worked through the first two selections on the DVD on two of my DVD players. I tried it on three other DVD players and the DVD wouldn't play at all. I don't know if I just had a defective copy or the DVD's were burned on really cheap discs, but I don't have enough time to wait for a replacement DVD to find out. I just returned the DVD and went to the local Border's book store to buy a different instructional wedding dance DVD."
1,bad warranty policy,"I bought a kid's Timex watch for my son. It broke after 7 month of use (even though the kid is very neat). The get it fixed or replaced, you have to mail the watch and also include $8 return postage fee. Is it worth the effort?"
4,It was alright,"I didn't fall as hard for this book as I fell for Dutch I, but it was a good read also. Of course the ending (once again) has you screaming for more. this book goes to show you how people can change over a period of time, especially once they find what they believe is them true selves. And some people....don't change at all."
4,Just As Good,"I had to read this book after that explosive ending of the first book, and this book picked up where Dutch I left off. The main focus is Angel vs. Roc vs. Rahman and him fighting his old demons. This book has plenty of drama to hold you over until the final book. This is a must read for all Teri Woods fans and this book also has a cliffhanger ending that has you yearning for more."
1,Piece of JUMK,"This is a very noisy fan, so much that I had to take them out and toss them. It's junk, don't waste your money."
2,"contrary to other reviews, our boots are not coming out dry","My sons wear rubber boots (Muck Boots) at school all day where they get wet and muddy, and water gets inside from an awesome day splashing in the Alaska fall rain.The dryer just does not get the boots completely dry inside. Warm, sure, but after 2 weeks nightly use they have never come out dry.The boots are on the dryer a minimum of 12 hours a night, usually longer. Going to buy a Peets dryer locally and see if that style works better."
5,Works great,DryGuy Thermanator Boot and Shoe DryerI bought it so I could bring it for my ski trips. It is portable and worked great. The wet boots got dried in a few hours. I also used it to dry gloves.
5,LOVE IT!,We originally bought 2 of these and loved them so much that we bought 2 more and gave one to a friend when we stayed with them in Aspen. I think the quality is great and they do dry ski boots and gloves nicely. I highly recommend them.
1,too difficult,i gave up on itno insructionsparts should be numberedparts don't hold together without glueand if you make a mistake when you glue it its ruined.
5,"A superb, thorough treatment of potentially difficult topic.","I've been involved with OO Design for over 10 years, and thought I knew it all. This book is more than an excellent introduction to methodology for novice programmers - it's also an excellent reference for how to apply patterns in the real world using Java. This book packs an amazing amount of clear and concise material into a surprisingly cheap package. I'm sorry to say, I paid full price for it - and it was still a bargain. Everything from UML to Beans to RMI to Web development. Great book."
1,"If you are even vaguely familiar with OOAD &Java, forget it!","This book is inaccurate, too simple and does not address patterns in a realistic way at all, essential to successful oo design in my opinion. Just authors out to make a quick buck with a poor quality hardback book and a cd.These days I find it harder and harder to find books as good as the o'reilly series. Whatever you want, you can find much more of it there, than here."
2,Not up to snuff,"Way too superficial for such a fat book. I don't understand the authors' refusal to use UML. They only use it to illustrate the few design patterns they cover. But my favorite chapter is 14 where they discuss databases. After a micro-blurb on what JDBC is, the authors tell us that a description of using that interface is out of scope of the book. They then proceed to teach us all about relational DB concepts, the building of E-R diagrams, and all about normalization. Somehow, they think that these things are within the scope of OO Design in Java."
5,An excelent for all teens.,"This is a great book for all readers. Whether you're 13 or 19 you will love this book. Its even suitable for all sport lovers! No matter what sport you play or watch, this book is for you. And if sport books aren't for you, then this book is still a real keeper. Read as an out-of-shape 14 year-old gets beat up in all the sports. Also, read as he faces peer pressure and some severe decisions, but mixed in with all of this is some real humor. I recommend this book to all teenagers and sport lovers. Be sure to read the sequel ""Extreme Elvin"". Enjoy!"
4,Comments on Avery's Memories,"This is an interesting glimpse into the life of an ordinary Civil War soldier. Karla Husby and her editor did an excellent job of putting together Henry Avery's observations about his war experiences. A must read for Civil War buffs, especially those from Michigan and those with interest in Custer. It should be noted that I have a bit of a bias since James Henry Avery was the brother of my gggrandmother."
5,Excellent book,"I read this book a while ago and found it very helpful. It is very well laid out and it is flexible and workable.I must admit, however, that I have some problems - time management starts from your life goals, and mine aren't clear at this point (they were years ago, but not any more). Still, this isn't book's fault - I need to figure this out before I get the most out of my time."
5,Excellent book,Great book; if only I can apply the principles. Very well written and organized (the point of the book). Service provider delivered on time and the book is in excellent condition.
3,I got bogged down and couldn't find time to finish the book,This seems like it would be a good book for those with problems managing their time. I started to read it and got distracted and then just couldn't find time to finish. Maybe I need a book on time management to get through this one.
5,Selenium is purported to reduce the risk of certain cancers,"I have been using 100mcg of the antioxidant Selenium daily for the last eight years. My doctor back then recommended Solaray and I have kept with this brand.Selenium is as essential trace mineral and functions as part of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione perioxidase. It is bonded to the essential sulfur amino acid, methionine.According to the FDA's website:""Selenium may reduce the risk of certain cancers. Some scientific evidence suggests that consumption of selenium may reduce the risk of certain forms of cancer. However, FDA has determined that this evidence is limited and not conclusive"".There is no way of me knowing how much good these supplements actually do. Just to be sure, I have my servings of fruits and vegetables every day!(I also take100mg of Grapenolas an added antioxidant, twice weekly).All's well so far :)"
2,Not comparable to Sharper Image,We had a battery operated can opener from Sharper Image for several years. This one although designed the same does not open cans as well as our previous one. This one stops cutting through to the can at least half way through every time. You have to basically hold it down to cut through. Disappointed with this product - preferred sharper image model
2,Disposable Can Opener,"The can opener works great and then will run out of battery life in the middle of opening a can. At that point, there is no way to get it off the can, so you must toss both the can and can opener in the trash. I cut my finger trying to get the can opener off the can. Mine ran out of batteries after opening eight cans. I would not recommend buying this product."
1,NOT PLEASED WITH PRODUCT OR SELLER,FIRST TIME I USED THIS IT JAMMED AND I COULD NOT NOT REMOVE CAN..CONTACTED SELLER AND WAS SUPPOSED TO GET A CALL FROM HIS TECHNICIAN ON HOW TO REMOVE CAN NEVER GOT THE CALL SO AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED CANOPENER AND SELLER ARE LOUSY
2,Poor Opener,"I bought this can opener about 3 months ago because I liked that it was small and opened a can without leaving a sharp edge. It worked great on a couple cans but most of the time it got stuck on the can and I had to fight to remove it.I got so tired of it getting stuck that I purchased the Hamilton Beach 76606 Pop-Top Electric Can Opener. This can opener is MUCH better and I tossed the One Touch in the garbage because it wasn't worth the effort returning it and I wouldn't dream of giving this piece of junk to someone else.Bottom Line: Do NOT buy this. If you buy it, you WILL be disappointed!"
2,Read several reviews - the bad stuff is true,"This little battery muncher absolutely has a mind of its own. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, and don't try holding on to it so it doesn't fall off on to the counter when it's finished or it will stop, then you get to try to get to the reverse button with a a partially opened can hanging on for dear life. Also it will do nothing more than put a death grip on a number 10 can, and you're back to trying to get to the reverse button. Any can filled with liquid is probably going to get spilled, so have mop rag ready. The only reason this little monster is still in the house is because my man likes his gadgets and he bought it for me...So he gets to detach the beast while I reach for my 35 year old Swing A-way that hasn't failed me yet."
2,Useless waste of money,This was my 3rd purchase of this product. You would think I would think I would have learned a lesson on the first two! NONE of them lasted very long and this third one did not work at all! It would not grip the can and would not cut the top off as advertised. I see they have lowered the price now but it is STILL NOT WORTH THE PRICE! My wife has severe difficulty using a regular can opener so we tried this one. NOT! If she needs another electric can opener I will get one with a cord attached that actually works. This product is useless in my opinion!
3,Sometimes it's good,My husband bought this can opener for his mother and she loved it so much that we bought one for ourselves. It was great for the first year but now it gives me trouble opening most cans. Some cans are too thick for it to open. It can take 5 minutes to open one can because I have to keep going over and over the same can. I replaced the batteries and it still did the same thing. Every now and again it comes back to life and opens up a can quickly and easily but then it gets tired again after a few uses. I am currently online searching for an under the counter electric can opener because the last one I had worked much better and more consistently than this one.
1,Quit without warning!,"This worked fine and gave no inkling that the batteries needed to be changed until it quit while clamped onto a can. No matter how I tried I could not get it to release. So I had to toss the whole thing, can and all.I was so frustrated! I would have changed the batteries had I known this would happen, but it worked fine and gave me no warning. Maybe a low battery light would help?"
1,one touch can opener,"Can opener failed in middle of opening can. Can would not release and had to be pried from the opener. New batteries did not help, so I threw the opener in the trash."
1,What happened?,"I had a pink one of these for my wife and she loved it, worked just fine, just got old and needed to be replaced. This one that I just got was garbage out of the box. I'm not sure if they changed their parts, or if I just got a defective product, this this is about as effective as trying to open a can with my forehead. If it wasn't so cheap, I'd be pretty upset. I'd say check it out if you have 20 bucks to blow and you're not too worried about the outcome, chances are you'll get a good product."
1,WHAT A JOKE,"What a joke this thing is....I wonder how products like this even make it out of the test kitchens/laboratories. I mean seriously, if all it takes to invent a product is a good pitch man then I'm in the wrong business. I'm going to turn into an inventor.I will not waste any words or time on this piece of trash.We bought into the pitch man's advertisement and picked this thing up...It NEVER WORKED RIGHT. NOT ONCE.You put it on the can, start it and then it would stop in the middle of the can. The reset button didn't work the opener became stuck on the can and then we had the pleasure of PRYING THE THING OFF OF THE CAN which took a lot of work. We tried replacing batteries...nope. NOTHING.ZERO STARS.WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND EVER EVER EVER!"
3,"It works, but it's not really necessary","I purchased this can opener because my husband kept complaining about the ones we have. It's a good idea but I think the only advantage is the way the lid comes off. It takes the whole rim off, instead of just the inner metal part. This simply avoids the possibility of cutting your fingers on the sharp edges. It moves incredibly slow but it does in fact do the job! Still, I find myself reaching for the old ""standby"" basic handheld can opener. Also, I don't believe this opener works on large (or small) coffee cans. That's what I really wanted it for."
1,One touch review,"One touch is right! After trying to open four different cans, it only took one touch to throw this thing in the trash. Luckily, I had also purchased the Hamilton Beach variety (which actually worked as advertised)so I didn't have to beat the cans open with a screwdriver, to fix some dinner. Don't waste your time and money on this One Touch stuff."
1,Amazon is ignoring me,"April 3, 2011, I placed an order with Amazon for two One Touch can openers, one was a gift and one was for me. I received them and neither worked. They did not have the One Touch logo on them. I contacted Amazon and they told me to send an email, which I did, to make my claim and the would forward it on to Ebulalways. I heard nothing. Called Amazon again and wrote another email on May 4. In the meantime, I ordered one can opener which I received with the One Touch logo on it. It works great. I asked that my account be credited for the two defective can openers and again heard nothing. Why are you asking for feedback if you don't do anything about the complaints. Is someone not doing their job at Amazon or what? Why aren't I entitled to a reply. Let's see if you put these comments out there for other customers to see.I don't hate the product. Why is it rated like that. I am rating Amazon."
2,Not like orig.,"I had a good one of these but it wore out the gear that allows it to roll around the can. I liked it .So I bought 3 of them to give 2 of them as gifts. Forget that, the first one broke off the gear.The 2nd one is not set to cut deep enough,so I have to run it around the can 4 or 5 times to try to get it to cutall around the can. I have not tried the 3rd one yet. So can not grade it.One Touch Can Opener"
1,piece of JUNK,"this is a huge waste of money, had two and both stopped functioning after about ten uses, thought the first time was a fluke, nope it's junk. stops releasing lids and you have to use pliers and a lot more strength than arthritic hands can muster to get the lid out. P.O.S. really handy at dinner time to find pliers and start wrestling with your can opener."
1,Dissatisfied,"We tried it when it first arrived. I had purchased it for my husband for a hunting trip, as he only has one arm, and thought it would be easy for him to use.It worked the one time when we tried it at home, and when he got to his destination and tried to use it, it DIDN'T work. A friend had brought a regular can opener and that is what they used the whole time they were there.We had purchased the One Touch jar opener and have loved it. It works every time, so we are VERY unhappy that the can opener wasn't as good. I would NOT recommend it to anyone. It is a waste of money."
2,Misleading ad,"This can opener was as advertised, but my mother wanted me to order this for her for the jar opener, which the ad said was included. When we got these, the jar opener was not included, but was something you had to send in for from the package.This product, though ok, was misleading in its add. It very clearly says with BONUS JAR OPENER. Buyer beware, it isn't included."
2,Original model is Unreliable,"My first One Touch lasted 3-4 years and I was very happy until it failed. When that happened, it was stuck to the can and just kept running - it was very difficult to remove the opener from the partially opened can. Thought it was just old so ordered another and it FAILED, JAMMED, BROKE after opening only 3 cans! Poor me, I cut my finger trying to separate the opener from the can! Had also bought the smaller ""One Touch II"" and so far, it works well, but my trust level has sadly sagged. Mike"
2,One Touch........most of the time,"This can opener does open a can by itself, if it is a regular size can, but sometimes it takes more than 'one touch' to get it started. Once started, it goes all around the can and cuts it open from the side. It comes to a stop automatically. The top of the can comes off with the can opener when you take it off, but it does leave the very top edge of the can itself with a razor sharp edge and also leaves a 'shaving' or sliver of material hanging; paper or metal? Not sure, but usually leaves this little shaving of material you have to be careful not to get in your food. I have been using it, but I use it with care. I would not recommend it for a household where children may use it, I think there may be a saftey issue here."
5,Intriguing twists keep the reader glued to the book,"Read Don't Say A Word by Barbara Freethy ; excellent story, complex, well written , full of twists.is it my face? The search to find out became ever more complex, and the links between characters ever more interwoven as the author kept me glued to my Kindle for 400 pages. Don't think you know it all until the very end; an excellent read, worth the time."
1,"If I could give it less than one, I would.","I've been a reader for YEARS, read everything I can get my hands on for years it was free fanfiction. This was worse than the worst fanfiction I've ever read. She said the same things OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER again. The relationship between Julia and Alex is awful never really progresses goes from A to H in a heartbeat.....Don't waste your 2 bucks."
5,couldn't put it down!,excellent story.....Love Barbara Freethy....but think this one is her best....storyline keeps you interested all the way through....loved it so much I loaned it to my aunt who finished it in a day....she couldn't put it down either
3,It could have been a lot better,"I'm home sick, in bed for a week, need something easy to read just to keep from being bored to death. This book was not it. I agree with a previous review; boring, boring, boring, but I am still reading 'cause ya gotta have something to occupy your mind while you're lying there waiting to get well. I'm just half way through, and if I had another book, I'd be reading it. The opening pages were wonderful . . . what happened? Right now, the only mystery I'm concerned with is, ""Will I finish this book or not""?"
4,A solid 4 star debut for the new series,"Book 1 - Maggie follows fate to Enchantments, a local eclectic antique store, where she gets a job and can escape her bad job. The murder of her bosses sister stars Maggie on the road to investigation ... and perhaps some trouble as well."
3,Just O.K.,"The suspense was definitely there, but a little too much of the occult/new age stuff for me. The story itself was good."
3,First in a series,"Maggie O'Neill is fired one morning from her boring job as a collections clerk and is rehired the same day to work for the town's resident witch in her gift store.Maggie soon becomes embroiled in a murder involving the witch, Felicity. Maggie soon finds out they she may have some extra sensory skills of her own.I enjoyed the story but I was not really sold on Felicity's magic skills and found the story a bit contrived.It was unbelievable to me, as well, that Tom Fielding an officer who is investigating the murder, would give out information about the scene of the crime and the method of death. Most investigators withhold that type of information until a suspect is identfied.Also, I suppose that because this is the first in the series, Maggie's love interest in the policeman, Tom Fielding was left hanging and perhaps there will be more to that connection in subsequent books.I have read better books on the supernatural so this one did not really hold up for me."
5,Loved it!,"Calvin take me away!!! Great story, delightful details - felt as if I were part of the plot. Already looking forward to the next one :)"
4,Have a blast with Maggie at Enchantments,"Alt's cozy mystery really spoke to my own beliefs and interests, and she had me giggling or pursing my lips in all the right places. The Trouble with Magic is a bit clumsy at times, but it's nothing that you wouldn't find in any first-in-a-series book. I loved the characters, found the narrative to be well-paced, and had a grand old time. I'll certainly be looking for the rest of the series!"
3,No Magical enough...,"This book began really well, descriptions of antiques and cute characters...Then it quickly changed. Maggie went to work for Felicity and all the cozy aspect disappeared. It was replaced with a very unusual set up... A murder, with maggies new boss number one suspect.Now Remember Maggie has not even worked there a full day yet and she suddenly believes her boss is 100% innocent. Why? There is no reason for this...and at times Maggie behavior is kinda odd, she puts herself in danger and can not see reason..All because he is sticking up for a boss she has known too minutes?!I enjoyed parts of this book purely for the rare if magical moments, a spirit here a witchy book there...But I expected more of that kind of thing in a series about magic!"
4,Really cute purse!!!,"This is my daughter's first purse, and she LOVES it! The cell phone is too cute! I don't like the coin purse part so much, but she still likes to play with that piece. It's a really nice quality toy all around though."
2,Missing piece,When the product came it was torn and had one of the three pieces missing. I called the seller and they said all of the purses were missing one piece. I would not order from this seller unless you are not worried about all the pieces.
3,I was in the thick of it,I was in the thick of it from fall of 1969 through summer of 1970. I worked for the Spectator and wrote a few articles. I marched in the demos. I was part of women's liberation. It was the most important year of my life. I went from being mild-mannered grad student to a person who questioned everything. It took me years to come down from the experience of being at IU at that time. The book is a good factual account of what happened but doesn't quite convey the unbelievable experience of watching the world change in front of your eyes. It was just a wonderful time.
3,Ok,Not horrible but not my first choice. Had some durability problems. Works but be careful can break easily. You will need a HDMI cable to connect to your TV.
4,Daevid Allen - 'Brainville Live In The UK' (Bananamoon Obscura),"Supposedly, a one-off (?) gig as a trio - Daevid Allen - guitar & vocals, Hugh Hopper - bass and Pip Pyle - drums. Someone apparently must've dug deep in their vaults, closet, sock drawer, etc. for this 1988 [?] performance. Tunes that more than manage to stand out are ""Fohat Digs Holes In Space"" (off the 2nd Gong lp 'Camembert Electrique'), the intricate ten-minute ""Flowers Gone"", the awesome ""Thinkin' Thoughts"" and the total tripping ""Hope For Happiness"". You know, I'm quite taken with how many of these limited edition Daevid Allen releases on the Bananamoon Obscura label that has turned out as great sounding as they have. #2."
1,Did not like,Found this to be a waste of my money. I bought one for myself and one as a gift. The gift was never used. I tried to use mine for a couple of weeks and never noticed any improvements to my skin. Would not reccommend.
1,very disappointed,"I was very disappointed this and the other case that I from this store they are very cheap. I thought that they Where a solid color, but it turns out that the plastic is one color and the color on the outside is painted and scratches off very easily . I will never but anything from this store again 1st I received them 2wks late and second they are so cheaply made it looks like i got them out of a gum ball machine."
2,Ok Butterfly stool,"This product was difficult to put together. It took me an hour to finally get all the pieces to fit and tighten the screws, etc. There was a mistake in the first set of instructions. When it was finally put together the product looked nice. There are sparkles on the flowers and buttlerflies and the colors are vibrant. However, the stool is not very sturdy and the materials are very cheap."
3,Disappointed,"I was excited when I saw this cd at the store b/c I had read so many good reviews of it. I must admit I was rather disappointed by this cd. They are not bad musicians, but no song every really struck me. As I said the musicians are not bad, but I do not feel they compare with the likes of Symphony X or Rhapsody. Youngblood has some decent rhythms but don't look for all out jawdropping fretwork like you would expect from Romeo, Malmsteen, or even Turilli. If you want a heavily orchestrated metal band, stick with Rhapsody."
1,Less is More from Pentaphobe,"I was very excited to listen to this CD. When it finally arrived I thought I had accidentally purchased the soundtrack to Resident Evil: The Apocalypse. This music has a very dark vibe and is difficult to dance to, or do anything else for that matter, without a sense of impending doom. It's creepy, haunting sound mixes don't really succeed in incorporating any tribal music. I'm stunned one could belly dance to this. It is less tribal metamorphosis and more scary acid trip. I wish I could ship this one back and make a better choice. Save your money my fair friends and just pass this one by."
2,not so good...,"I was very disappointed with this c.d. The only good songs on it are the ones that Rachael dances to on the Bellydance Superstars DVD. It's alot of industrial noise with no melody. If you're looking for music to do interperative dance to, check it out. If you're looking for something upbeat and inspiring, you might want to pass."
2,"Disappointing, a couple of good tracks","I love belly dance music and industrial, so this sounds like the perfect CD for me, right? Instead I found this album all kinds of boring and without any kind of melody or even a beat in the majority of the songs. I think the best way to describe it is ""not enough of either and too much of both."" For being an album for dancers, these songs are not easy to dance to--not the kind of music that you put on and want to groove to. I like ""I Cash Radii"" and ""Cybelle"". The rest are fairly unlistenable and rather pretentious. For my tribal dancing music fix, I much prefer Beats Antique and you can usually download their albums for free. Just my 2 cents."
2,Had no effect on my dog,"I used the maximum dose of Composure allowed for my dog, per the instructions. Not only did the product have no effect on his anxiety, he broke out of his crate that day for the first time. Perhaps it helps some pets but not mine."
4,I really like the taste,"I will say I like only SOME vegetables and this makes it easier for both myself and family to get more of or veggies into daily life, if not always on the dinner plate."
4,Boot Warmers,"Good product, works well, could be improved by having the cord between the two boots longer for my ski bag."
2,too basic,"I agree with the other reviewer, way too basic for me. May be good for the average person who knows little about hair. I thought most of the information was common knowledge, and there were even a few things in there that were just wrong. They mention over and over again that you have to wash your hair every day, which is completely the wrong thing to do for many people. I got this as an addition to a series of more hair books, brushing up on my hair knowledge after 7 years of doing hair professionally, and I learned nothing from this book. I found myself skipping through it, it was boring to me."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"Where do I begin? I only read this book because the back cover contained a good review by Frank McCourt, who must have been either drunk or insane when he wrote it.The writing in this story is no different from a Harlequin Romance. The characters are unbelievable, the plots are stupid, and the characters are so utterly unlikeable that you actually relish in their misery.The second novella concerns a raving idiot of a husband who cannot get over his wife's ""infidelity"". They go for counselling, he ends up on Prozac and Viagra, and acts like a moron every chance he gets. And his wife didn't even have an affair - she had a one-night stand consisting of oral sex.What this author doesn't know about men is a lot: her male character is essentially a woman named David. No man acts, thinks, or behaves, quite like this. This author is obviously connected - how else can such trite fluff be published?"
2,Blue Moon,"The main charactor is a big dork. I read this for a book club. I really had to push myself to read it all the way thru. The plot was too predictable. It's cheesey,I was happy when Mr. Perfect got pissed and blew his stack. But this book does make you want to go to Mexico."
2,A diferent focus,"This book talks about an interesting idea that focuses on the combative aplication of Qi, stressing instantanious damage.The Empy Force reads like a poorly written technal paperthat uses speculation as evedence and ""ancient chinese legends"" as irevocable proof. Perhaps its the lack of said 'legends' in the american culture that has left me pesamesticly speculative.That being said: Some of the things described are amazingly simmilar to what I have found myself doing in zen meditation. Also I intend to incorperate some of the other techniques into my meditations and movement. I suspect that this book holds knowledge for those more famaliar with the chinese form of thinking (or expression) than I am. It has been my experiance studying Traditional Chinese Medicine (here in the states) that the chinese love medafors and wont say what they meen. I belive the reason for this is because the journy of discovery yields the best results."
3,"Useful for Aspiring, Crime Fiction Writers","Pretty good stuff, but a bit lacking, in my opinion. I wish a retired, LAPD detective would write one of these...or Michael Connelly, who outdoes this one in most of his novels."
5,It works!,I was working with a stamp grinder on my property today and accidently touch the engine cover with my fingers. It was hot like a flatiron and I was sure that I will loose the sking on the fingers. My wife immidietely gave me this burngel. I applied it and was able to continue to work. I kept appling it every time I felt pain and after a few hours the pain was gone and didn't even get a blister.
4,"A Great New Series! -- For women facing ""change""","I think this is a heroine for our times! This is not one of those young, pouty-lipped, long-legged, blondes with whom every other male character falls in love. This is a real character with whom you want to meet for lunch and dish the dirt. This will be one of those you pass on to other female friends of a ""certain age."" I don't think men will like this one. They just won't get it. I also like the use of letters and emails to start off each chapter. It really helps move the story."
5,River Roas Recipes Volume 1,This is the first volume that was originally published and by far one of the best cookbooks ever.Recipes are clear and easy to follow and each one is a jewel in itself. My wife has used this bookover the past 52 years. There is a volume two which is very good but nothing has ever matchedthis edition. I have purchased more than a dozen over the years and given them as priceless gifts.
5,Love this poster,This poster captures such a beautiful moment between mother and baby! I get many compliments on this picture that I have framed for my office! I love love love it!!!!
2,Not quite what I expected,"Not the original Betty Boop cartoons as they were but a recut ""remix"" with a voiceover by a Smothers brother."
1,Frustrating,"I bought this a couple of years ago and I've never gotten it to work properly. Mine appears to remain functional but it's a struggle to assemble and use correctly and even when I manage it, it doesn't do a very good job drying anything. An exercise in kitchen frustration. Other reviewers have enumerated this product's many flaws more eloquently than I could - heed them and do not buy this salad spinner!"
1,Warped the first wash,"The spinning basket warped the first time I washed it in my ancient dishwasher that doesn't get very hot at all. It said ""dishwasher safe"" on the box but apparently not. I've never had ANYTHING plastic warp in this dishwasher before, including the little plastic throw-away cups that come with Nyquil. I recycle and reuse these as bathroom cups in place of disposable paper ""Dixie"" cups and I couldn't count the number of times they've been washed in the same dishwasher with no ""casualties"".I didn't buy this from Amazon, but as I was looking for a new salad spinner, I saw the Kitchenaid one and decided to rate it. I'm going to try to take it back but I didn't keep the box. My bad!"
1,Worst KitchenAid product I've used,"I really wanted to like this salad spinner, but ended up hating it. The spinning mechanism is very difficult to use, because the plunger locks if you push too hard. And the lettuce doesn't get very dry. Also, the plunger soaks up water, so I was always afraid that dirty water could be getting into the lettuce."
1,Worst $ I've spent in a long time,"This product never would like down like it was supposed to, and the stem would spring up suddenely with such force that stuff in my fridge was knocked over and broken. For something made entirely of plastic, it's way over priced. Don't buy it."
1,Not one orignal thought!,This was a cheap Twilight rip off filmed with mommy's camera and acted by volunteers. 2 hours you will never get back.
3,Teri Woods needs an editor,"This is my first Teri Woods book. The distractions caused by poor editing diminishes the impact of the story being told. Unfortunately [well, maybe not - Ms. Woods does have a unique approach] I will have to buy the next book in the trilogy to see if her editors do their job. I can only hope that the editors give me reason to purchase the third in the trilogy - or any of her other books."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"I'm sorry but Terri Woods could have did better! I brought Part 2 and I'm mad because the first one was so bad it took me days to read it! It should have been a movie, and not a book!"
4,Ready for the sequel,"I could not put this book down. I was so upset that Dante got away at the end, I wish that he would of been caught. If you are interested in purchasing this book, get ready to be faced with alot of drama. The part that I hated is how naive Grace Moore was on Damien, other than that I loved the book and will be purchasing the sequel."
3,Bernice's review,The book was difficult to get into. The location made it difficult. This is the worst book that she has written in comparison to her others.
5,Works very well.,"Nice to find a product that works as advertised. We ran the antenna out of a window in our home. I was going to do a more permanant setup, but it is working so well I decided to leave it alone."
4,Good Read,"Enjoyed the book immensely. Read it in two sittings.Although, it is a bit dated socially, it is a good story and held my interest to the end. I find most of this authors books(at least in the sci fi catagory) to be very readable."
1,So this is Love? No this is trash!,"Let me just start off my review by saying this is not a review of the movie itself, but the awful box set that it is.I pre-ordered this package a while back and was excited to finally watch this classic Disney masterpiece. The thing is I couldn't!!It turned out the box set is packaged like every other awful package that is left with bad reviews. The discs are in between cheap decorative cardboard. Not on the reg plastic holder kind that actually keep your discs in awsome condition. I don't understand why companies do this, especially Disney. I know why!!! They are only out for money not for our happiness. Two of the 6 discs in this set I recieved were severely damaged. They were unplayable.This is very sad to see yet another set ruined by stupid marketing.Now I have to waste my printer ink and time to send this item back to amazon and hope for my refund and no proplems.DISNEY YOU SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Wife loved it!,I got this for my wife as an early birthday present. She liked it a lot. The digital copy will be nice on her iPod on vacation next month.
2,Could be much better,"This could be a really nice chair, but the manufaturer needs to rework the footrest. The very first time I used the chair, the zipper that connects the footrest to the chair broke. A big disappointment."
2,"A ""feel good"" book lacking real answers.","This book is great at detailing the emotional aspect of psoriasis, but fails miserably when it comes to treatment options. Calling it ""A Patient's Guide to Treatment"" is misleading. If you are having problems handling psoriasis emotionally, this is the book for you. If you are looking for concrete medical information, The Handbook of Psoriasis by Charles Camisa would suit you better."
5,good Seattle-based series,interesting plots and interesting characters in this series. Start with the first book (First Avenue) as the characters and some back story continue in the subsequent books
2,works sometimes only for a short period of time,"i bought this cd after reading the reviews. it is not as superb as they describe it to be. there are about 99 tracks but 30 or so different sounds, so the same sounds repeat at least 3 times. my baby doesn't seem to be entertained by some of the sounds and i skip them to find the ones she likes best. it works only when she is too sleepy and any other cd may also do the trick for her to calm down. i would not recommend it to anyone for this price"
1,HMMMMM!!,"Wow this book sure does get mentioned alot on Amazon, if I didn't know better I'd say the author is a schill. Let me go and do a search customer reviews, oops, when I click search I get some weird ASIN number in the search box, let me remove the asin number and search again. BINGO, The author is a schill, and off I go to report my findings to Amazon.Lets see how long this book lasts on Amazons site."
2,You need a 1 inch socket to install this.,"It is a nice filter, but I still had to install it with a filter wrench. The socket on the end is 1 inch. I just don't have a wrench that big laying around."
3,A bit disappointed!,"My wife and I watched the whole series and found it interesting enough but not nearly up to par with the other BBC productions we have enjoyed. The lead female characters were annoying. Elizabeth had as much appeal as a dead fish, virtually emotionless and bland. It seemed to me that this may have had as much to do with the actress playing the part as the role itself. The character Demelza was another story. Basically she was a classic whiner and I got tired of her overacting quite early in the series. How Poldark could find any redeeming qualities in these two is beyond me. The rest of the cast was excellent.Each episode ended with an attempt at a cliffhanger which really wasn't as intriguing as it hoped to be. The whole series seemed more like a videotaped stage play than a smooth flowing production, like for instance ""Wives And Daughters""."
1,"If you have an open mind, this still marked the end of DJ Shadow as we knew him","It was a terrible musical mistake to attempt to create a commercial-sounding album for the first 8 songs, and try to recover the underground support with the last few tracks. What was DJ Shadow smoking/not smoking? He even stole the album cover from a similar artist (DJ Wally) - it's just a really bad album, plain and simple. If you want good DJ Shadow, check out Endtroducing or even Private Press - which is very underrated in my opinion."
3,Byaah!,"So Shadow mixed it up, and many are disappointed. So he's not top dog no more, so what? Hopefully he finds lucrative success in the mainstream, good luck to him. But I guess to the underground faithful, your new man is Rjd2. The choice is yours...you can get with this, you can get with that."
1,classic.....,"How can an artist not care about his audience? I own all his records as well, but this reminds me of when Wayne Newton decided to put out a heavy metal album?? Whats next your going to team up John Tesh and Yanni? Come on Josh, put the pipe down and get back to business, i know you have bills to pay and trying to go mainstream with this ying yang rap sound is tired. Call Gift of Gab and Lyrics Born back up and make a hip hop album with them."
1,It is noon and the Shadow is gone.,"This is music for the scum of the human race - trash rap (there is good rap, and I own lots of it...along with 5 DJ Shadow CD's, but thankfully not this one), awful music that nobody will like or care about in a few years.I am very disappointed with this music, it is horrible. I thought DJ Shadow was better than this, but obviously not. We can only hope he will redeem himself one day, I will certainly forgive him.This sort of music seems just like the pop trash on the 'urban' Hip-hop/R&B; stations, you know, where a song is played a few times an hour for a month, then is never heard again?'Endtroducing' is a decade old and still sounds great today (and Amazon sales rank of #1,350 in music). I am willing to bet this album will be completely forgotten in a decade.I'll miss you Shadow."
2,Somebody spilled their Lil Jon all over my Shadow,"When it's at its best, it sounds like the gorillaz on an off day. When it's at it's worst, it could be used to coax Osama out of a cave. I thought it was a mistake. I put the CD in and then pulled it out around track 4 to make sure it wasn't a mix up at the factory and I got the new crunk in the trunk mixtape. I look forward to the make-up album that should come out soon in an effort to save face."
1,skip this one,I do not know what happened to Shadow but this album is awful. I bought it the day it came and and sold it used at a loss after one listen just to recoop something. Why he needed to fill the tracks with substandard mcs is unknown. Maybe it was his sellout to the new major label he's signed to. It would have been much better if he had better mcs or had put more instrumentals on it. Skip it. This artist is past his prime.
5,Get ready to pitch that indoor tent!!!,"Bailey's older siblings are off on a camping trip, but Bailey's too young to go. What to do? Why, have an indoor camping adventure, of course.This simple, sweet, warm, loving story will really appeal to younger children. The illustrations are wonderful, the text is straightforward and the situations ring genuinely true. This is the sort of tale that leaves a fond smile on everyone's face. Be advised, however, after reading it you'll likely be looking for an old blanket to thrust into tent duty fot the afternoon!Do your whole family a favor and go camping with Bailey!"
2,not what I expected,"I thought this book would be a memoir of a woman having suspisions and then finding out about her husband's crossdressing. Followed by how their relationship changed and how she finally learned to accept. It is not like that at all. The book reads like a psychology textbook on crossdressing. The problems it causes the men and woman etc. the stages they go through, society's views etc. It does have some interveiws but mostly the reading is very dry."
3,Very expensive pamphlet,"Arrived on time and in excellent condition. However I would not call this a book, it was more like a 20 page pamphlet. Had I known that it was basically just a handout and not a book, I would not have spent the amount of money it was listed for."
2,Horribly edited,"I studies physics over 20 years ago in high school, so perhaps I'm rustier than I realized. BUT, what seemed like a helpful book was seriously marred by repeated inconsistencies between the diagrams and the description of the diagrams in the text. ""km/hr"" in the text are shown as ""km/m"" in the diagram; symbols are different; in one case, the text clearly meant to refer to ""t"" [the symbol for time] but the symbol was just dropped [""if it moves for hours"" instead of ""if it moves for t hours""]. Plus, the author does a good job of setting up the basic explanations, but when giving example problems, he relies on the diagrams to explain the solutions. Since the diagrams are often wrong or inconsistent, it left me a little muddled. I'm not sure how anyone made it through this book. Didn't they have a copy editor?"
1,Only borrow; don't buy,"Having wasted money several times purchasing books in the ""Complete Idiot"" series, I will only borrow them from the library when no other books on the subject are available. This book is a prime example. It fails to completely explain the sample problems it uses and makes references to places in the book that don't exist. There are errors in calculations in the sample problems that were driving me nuts till I read other reviews which revealed I was not the problem."
2,Good for a superficial understanding,Gives you a superficial understanding of some basic physics concepts overall a good teaching device.
3,Somewhat inacurate cuts,"I used this saw on plywood, using a fine toothed blade. My cuts were not as accurate as with an older version of a Skil saw. Perhaps this is because of my technicque and practice, but I found another old saw to be much more accurate in cuts."
1,Apex crap,"I have the Apex 27"" and just bought a new Apex 20"" tv and I am VERY disappointed. The 27"" has an OK picture, you kinda get what you pay for. But the new 20"" one is terrible! I needed it in a bind (long story) and bought it. You can actually see the gigantic pixels!27"" = ok picture20"" = horrible picture. Cheap piece of crap for a TV.I'm sorry I bought it.I'll bet Apex 20-inchers sell well in 3rd world countries.That's where they belong.I have nothing more to say"
4,Really nice for the price.,"This Apex is one of the lowest priced 27"" TV's out there. Not many features, but a large set for not much money. There are two speakers, but this is a Mono television, not a big deal for me, but be aware if this is important to you."
5,Our Times,"Great book to get a well laid out view of the pop art of our times.While the mainstream media ignores low brow art as if it doesn't exist, on the contrary it is very successful amongst the many who grew up on comic books, Mad Magazine, monsters, tv shows, and so on.A great overview book, you can't go wrong with it."
5,A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE,This book can be a way of finding a comforting loving supportive place inside yourself.It does not shout at you or force you to think in a specific way .It gently guides you to discover for yourself.I highly reccomend it as the anti cynicism book.
5,"It is true, this was the best RPG system created.","Why? The world of Glorantha gets all the glory when people talk of Runequest, and it is indeed an incredible world set in rich detail, but it is the simplicity and playability of this system that really sets it apart. Keep in mind, the system we are talking about is well described in about 150 pages. Compare that to games with volume after volume of rule books like D+D and Rolemaster, etc and you will appreciate it. Not only simple, but in my mind the most realistic and fun. If you can get your hands on the Chaosium version you will know what we are talking about."
5,"Fits great, fashionable","I love the Cardinals - but I don't always love the bright red hat - sure, it's great at the ballgame, but sometimes it just doesn't work out with your outfit. Enter the ""Chocolate Marlin"" ballcap - a brown hat, with an attractive weathered look, that's comfortable and still shows your team support. I like it."
1,"Low quality thermal paste, not recommended","I bought this thermal paste and theCooler Master Hyper 212 Plus 120mm Sleeve CPU Cooler, RR-B10-212P-G1to cool my AMD 8-core FX-8120, they arrived a few days later, so when i installed my new heatsink i used theStarTech.com 1.5g Metal Oxide Thermal CPU Paste Compound Tube for Heatsink Cooling SILVGREASE1 (Silver)instead of the stock one that came with the cpu cooler and the result was a mess, temp went over 86 C while running stress test on Prime95, i tried everything i imagine, played with the speed of the fans, undervolt the cpu and nothing, until i decided to remove that silver waste in order to apply the stock thermal paste from Cool Master, check again the temps with Prime95 and i got an amazing 43 C while overclocked!, so my advice to you, if you have a gear similar than mine, do not waste your money on this thermal paste."
3,Exactly what I paid for no more- no less,This isn't a high performance conductive paste. It's slightly better than the stock white heat sink grease but not on a par with the more expensive silver compounds. I am not unhappy with this purchase.
4,Works well for Scuba boots,"I bought this to dry my Scuba boots, which as everyone who dives knows, are notoriously difficult to dry. Tried it once so far, and after drip drying, it took about 4 hours to finish drying. It uses no heat, so no danger of fire or damage to neoprene. Compact enough for travel as it fits into the boots.Compared to the other DryFast two-horned solid-plastic dryer, this one is much for compact for travel.My main complaint is the power adapter, which is the older transformer type (9 volt 0.5 amp DC), that works only on 120 volts -- a problem for international travel. That will require some fiddling to correct. Also it's a bit noisy, but can always be put away somewhere when it's running."
3,Enjoyable but uneven,"Essays on various explorations, the majority of which center upon the new world. I found the chapters on The Northwest Passage, Seven Cities, Prestor John, and Innocents Crusade (which I had never heard of before) very entertaining and informative. However, I thought the writing got bogged down with the story on The Aztec Treasure House, which dealt more about the writer then the explorers. But if any chapter bores you just move on the next, there is no string of thought or pacing tying them together. Overall it is a fact filled read, it lacks a bit of emotive writing but makes up for it in detail and obviously thorough research."
3,Easy and fast overview,"This is an easy and fast book to read if you want to get a basic overview of what evolutionary psychology is. Like the title says, it is an introduction and if you get the word introduction right, it means that you are going to see only the general aspect of what evolutionary psychology is. I recommend this book to people who are not sure about buying books of greater value on this subject. At less than 10 dollars, you'll have a good idea of what's in store for you in your further readings on the subject.Enjoy!Matt."
3,"Nice intro, but superficial.","For a more in depth and accurate analysis of evolutionary psychology, I would recommend ""How the Mind Works"", by Steven Pinker.Pinker makes his entire argument based on evolutionary psychology and how it has evolved from Evolution Theory and Computational Psychology, and thus dedicates an entire chapter to each of these topics, which is enough to go far beyond this book goes.If you like this book, you definetely should read ""How the Mind Works""."
2,Eh..,"I gave this magazine as a gift, and also received a subscription as a gift. I can't tell...is it the packaging? The ho-hum articles? I don't know. I had such high hopes for a great-quality magazine that would increase my environmental awareness and encourage me in my small attempt to live green. Alas, I've been disappointed and I won't renew."
3,Phil Collins,I liked the Song and thought it was great. I love Phil collins and thinks he is a very great song writer and singer.
2,Not All That Great,"I was pretty disappointed in this DVD set. I previously purchased the ""Rumble on the Rock - The Superstar Collection"" DVDs and I guess I expected the fights on this one to be of similar quality. Not even close. Night and Day difference.OK, I only paid ~$7 + shipping for the series, but that was in line with what I paid for the ROTR set, so that's no real excuse."
5,Orgasmic Birth - Wonderful Shower Gift,This video is a must view for all expectant mothers and mothers with children of any age because it can help you better understand the childbirth experiences that you have already had. I now keep a copy of this video on hand at all times so that I'm ready to give it to every expectant mother I know.
1,jelly beans,"I was very disappointed with the recent order of 20 lbs of jelly beans. FIrstly, I order 10 lbs of o1 flavor, and another 10 lbs of another flavor asortment, and because there were 2 differe flavors, they were shipped from 2 different places, therefore I had to pay a delivery charge for each!! when I got them, the same flavor was shipped from the 2 different places. The Jelly beans were ALL STALE!!! They were as hard as a rock!!! I could not return these as I was on a time frame to make party favors with them! I was extremely disappointed with these items!"
5,very compelling from start to finish,"Philadelphia Soul Phily International was incredible.the talents of Gamble,Huff&Thom bell amongest Others created some of the most Incredible Music over the past 35-40 years easily. this book goes inside where Ego,Power tripping&Other factors come into play.the sad part for me personally is that after the Philly International Era that City hasn't had anything that even comes half way close to what this Sound meant.so many great songs were composed from that Studio&Enviroment.so many Great Acts emerged from there including the Ojays,harold melvoin&the blue notes,Teddy Pendergrass,the Jacksons,Billy Paul,Bunny Sigler,Mcfadden&Whitehead,the intruders,&a whole lot more including the House band.the Sound of Philly help create the Soul Train theme song as well. this book breaks down the Political climate,Racial Issues&other factors that were going on.it's a incredible story overcoming so many obstacles&making things happen."
1,A Big Rip Off!,"The authors took information one can easily find on the internet and incorporated into what they call a book about the career and life of Chaka Khan. There was absolutely nothing new about Chaka in this book that we don't already know. In fact, some things were even wrong. Because I am such a hardcore Khan fan, I was duped and foolishly spent $40. At best this book should be selling for a measly $10. Thankfully, I have the disposable income to take this hit and chalk it up to another learning experience. However, somebody else out there might not be and so I'm putting the word out. Don't purchase this book or you will be greatly disappointed as I was. Not a good read or a good value for you hard earned money!"
5,Abnett is the Best!!,"Dan Abnett just keeps getting better and better. His first two books in the Gaunt's Ghosts series, while being mainly straight-up war novels (something I usually don't read), where so well-written, so rich in character and detail, they made up for the often predictable action plot lines. Necropolis keeps, and even trumps, the writing chops (and intense action) of the first two books, and adds complex political intrigues and a fascinating portrait of life in a hive at war (""hives"" are the gigantic vertical cities common in the Warhammer 40,000 universe).This book will not only appeal to players of Warhammer 40,000 proper, but also players of Nercomunda (the hive skirmish game that also takes place in the 40K world). But you don't have to play either of these tabletop wargames to enjoy Necropolis. All you have to be is a lover of good sci-fi and truly impressive story-telling."
4,Great book,"OK, lets face it, this book is not a literary masterpiece. But, if you want a good sci-fi ""junk food"" book, this just about fits the bill. Oh, and if you really want to blow your mind away, read the first half of this book, put it down, read up on the battle of Stalingrad, and then finish the book. Gives the thing a whole new perspective. A definate must if you enjoy any WH40K products."
2,Unwieldy,"For me and my hands, it is unwieldy. I could not get a slicing rhythm to it; I just sort of clogged along. The blade feels too bulky. If it were a thinner blade, it may have worked better for me. Also, I looked high and low on the Internet for some kind of blade cover for it and couldn't find anything. Right now it is unused in the way back of the drawer because I can't just throw it away."
3,Smaller than expected,This is a cute *little* gift for a baby however it is much smaller than I had in mind...about half the size of a tissue box.
1,Do not order if you are from the United States.,This is the international version of this book. If you are from the USA this isn't the version your professor will be using. Amazon needs to clearly identify this version as different from the regular edition.
2,"Book is great, but no CD!!","I bought this book online because it said that it was in great condition, and there was a CD with it, but when I got it the CD wasn't included!! I want my CD!!!"
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Sickeningly generic, creativityless emo. They just ape the most basic elements of other bands' songwriting without adding any unique hooks or chord progressions, and probably spend more time styling their hair than they do writing music. It disgusts me that bands like this are able to sell records."
5,Great value,"When you sit in it you are a little lower than you would probably like to be. The pillows/sits are to small I like to sit on the edge of it or stack the seats one on top of the other. The pump that came with it takes too long bought another one for it. Comfortably sits three. Have not tried to put six but how would you row it? You'd have no room to move! Bottom is very soft, but strong enough to stand in, at least one at a time. Handles waves good as it is so soft it simply bends to the shape of the wave."
3,needed a good immune vitamin,This capsule was recommended by a friend of mine so I purchased one bottle and didn't notice too much as of yet and am on my 2nd. bottle and am sure it will be fine. I feel better and have more of an appetite & more energy..
1,No character... just sex,"I'm only half way through this book and I'm disgusted. Actually, I've been disgusted almost from the first page. Amanda is weak - always giving into Jordan's sex drive - which is his answer to everything. There's been no discussion other than they don't want to talk. Even the sex scenes leave me flat - to the point where I'm just skipping over the repeated scenes. So sad, because normally I love Linda Lael Miller. But I'm not sure I'm going to finish this book."
3,A Smattering of Good Songs,"I'm somewhat disappointed by this album. I, too, like lo-fi, and I like most of Vic's releases.Too many songs on this CD sound like they were recorded in a shoebox. There are definitely some keepers here and lyrically Vic is in top form, but it's a real chore to listen to this CD from start to finish. My Last Act is a harrowing, disturbing song. Musically, there are a lot of good ideas that aren't fully developed.In regards to the lyrics this is a five star CD. Musically it rates one star.If you have never heard any of Vic's music, you do NOT want to start here."
5,Try in the tub! They float!,My 17 month old is obsessed with these bears and the cups. They are helping her learn colors and counting. She loves bringing them in the bath and she gets so focused that she doesn't realize I'm borrowing one of the cups to rinse her hair! Great for quiet times and light to bring to a restaurant. The bears will get lost. (they are going to the teddy bear's picnic). But it will be like a sick Easter egg hunt for you to try to round them up while your little angel is asleep -dreaming of new spots to store/hide them...
3,just so so,"the book is not very good, it is old and have many written words on it, and I take a long time to wait this book."
5,propitious endorsement,"This book has allowed me to exhibit my imperious eruditionwith unimpeded pedantry. I once was taciturn, but now amloquacious.D. Glib"
2,And this is about.....what?,Very disappointed. Superficial characters and story with little historical detail. Main theme seems to be the extent of homosexual relationships/tendencies among thewarriors up to and including Alexander. Most every chapter ends on such a note.
4,Does the job,"This product was much lighter weight than I expected, but it was still cool. It holds ample food, and the guy I bought it for loved it."
5,Good brakes,These are good quality brake pads. Worth the money. Don't skimp on brakes. Your life may depend on them.
1,THE SENSOR FAILED AND DID NOT WORK!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS PART WAS INSTALLED AND MECHANIC COULD NOT GET A READING FROM THE SENSOR, WHICH IS THE CORRECT CA EMMISION FOR MY 2000 4 RUNNER. . THIS PART WAS DEFECTIVE AND I WILL TAKE MY COMPLAINT TO THE MFG AND DIRECT THEM TO THE DISHONEST SELLER WHOM SOLD IT. DON'T USE THIS SELLER FOR ANYTHING!!!!!DON'T YOUR MONEY, THE WINDOW TO REFUND IS NOT CLOSED AND LOST MY MONEY ON SOMETHING THAT IS COMPLETELY WORTHLESS!!!!!"
5,Wonderful recipe book!,"This book was like a dream come true for me. The two previous River Roads Recipes books were my favorite cookbooks, but I was trying to cut back on the fat content that is usually so high in the Cajun & Creole cooking I grew up on. This book offered me the answers I was looking for."
4,Cookie Cutter,My daughter and I bake cookies at Christmas and looked hard to find cookie cutters that really cut through the different doughs. These did a super job and were easily cleaned!
4,Could use an improvement,The beanbag mount really works well for the GPS III+. It has an auxiliary carrier for extra batteries. The only fault is that the battery carrier is open on one end and the batteries keep slipping out. I don't know why they didn't provide a snap or some other closure to prevent this.
5,Too Close to Home,"In George Orwell's ""1984,"" Big Brother was watching you. In H. R. Silvastorm's ""A Matter of Privacy,"" someone is listening to you. From the bedroom to the boardroom, no conversation is sacrosanct when an insidious device is activated. From the very first page you are drawn into a masterfully delineated plot with vividly portrayed characters as real as your neighbors. This is a remarkable, plausible and suspenseful first novel."
5,Simply divine...,"Having grown up in India and gifted several Indian artifacts and books to friends worldwide, I have always wondered what gift would best capture the spirit, sights, and sounds of such a diverse culture, landscape, and environment. No single work of art could possibly do so, but this book comes close, evoking such fond and strong memories and visions of India, that this has, over the past decade, become THE one book I would encourage people to go through, to get a mesmerizing glimpse of India.Mainly pictorial, and close to being a coffee table book (not hardbound though and the binding could be a lot better...), it is by far the best book to encompass a range of visual images including India's landscape, its people, and hints of its cultural past and present. You will not be disappointed. Its a book not easily available, but if you ever come across it, don't think twice before grabbing a copy."
3,Grizzly can do better,"Installation was quite easy once I figured out the exact location on the drill pole.The sample mortises I made went well but I don't have enough experience with the tool to comment about that.As for the tool itself, it was quite disappointing to receive a badly polished non-painted greasy bare iron tool and parts which will stain any wooden workpiece passing through. On top of that, few parts were rusty and I had to clean the entire kit from grease and rust and cover it with T9 and wax.The suitcase it cones in is useless as most parts have no marked locations and others don't fit in theirs."
4,NG,I never like 2001.But Forbidden Planet is my favorite andthe special effect was great for its days.The time Machine is another great movie.
2,"Reference, not a book to learn ASP","This book is a reference. All it does it quickly mention all classes, objects and properties and explain what they do. This way some fundamental explanation is left out (while some trivial information has been copy-pasted dozens of times). As I am a professional VB and VBA programmer, I figured ASP wouldn't be too hard with a reference manual. Yet I failed to get ""the big picture"" with this book. I reckon it'll be a good reference for those that already have another ASP book..."
4,Very Good Reference,"I learn to program in ASP using this book. You will find good information about related topics like http protocol and ADO (to access databases). I'm using this book everyday. But I found some errors in the ASP code in the book, and the book don't cover the ASP VbScript."
1,Needs a 5 volt PCI slot,"Requires a 5 volt PCI slot, which rules out some newer systems (mine included). They should've made this a universal PCI card that could be used in either 3.3V or 5V slots."
3,Product was helpful in identifying problem with motherboard from ANTONLINE,"I bought a motherboard from ANTONLINE which was defective, despite repeated requests for assistance I purchased this product to definitively identify the problem as a defective motherboard. The product is a little expensive but when ordering from vendors like ANTONLINE which have poor return policies, it is helpful to be able to identify whether they have sent you a defective produce or not. This card is a helpful addition to my diagnostic toolkit."
1,Standard Deviants,"Try the Standard Deviants product, the teaching system and Standard deviants material are one and the same.Price at Standard deviants are cheaper Always"
3,"Deceiving Title, Probably Great for the Right Person","I was disappointed with this book because I had thought it would be broader and relate to all kinds of businesses. But this book is very specific to the entrepreneur starting up his or her own business, only. Its examples are mostly of home-based businesses or small sole proprietorships. The writing is sometimes condescending and assumes you know nothing whatsoever about finances and investments (which may be good for some readers). It includes several chapters of additional information for start-up companies which take up a significant portion of the book and have little or nothing at all to do with writing a business plan. I feel like this book is mistitled and would be better named, ""Mike's Guide to Founding and Funding your Own Business."""
2,Not too helpful,"It wasn't as detailed as I had hoped, I love Nolo but this book was not very useful for the business I need it for."
5,You can't go wrong with Nolo,Nolo is a wonderful source on all things business (in particular small business). I've been very happy with all of their books (the copyright and trademark book was exceptionally good). Thank you nolo for providing such great guides for us small business people!
3,roses for Harriet...but no stars for hero,"Despite the promising start, decent story line, good writing,... I really think the title should change to: ""How to bed Harriet"", at least this was what occupied Lord Kimbalton's mind through out half of the book.What made so unacceptable to me was that he carried the liaison even after his marriage, although it was agreed as a marriage of convenience, but spending months at a time in London with his whore (in author's words) with no thought of his new wife; even when he did finally wanted to claim his right, he was still thinking about his mistress, and on his way back to London he was thinking about Harriet...Make up your mind, please. Also his image to me was a grim-faced, agitated, domineering, odious oaf with a lascivious mind. I did not see much characters development in this story nor any romance in the relationship. A tiresome read."
5,Good value !,"The only product I bought off Amazon that did not take six weeks to get here! But the watch itself is good value a very smart looking watch,good big size."
5,Great Job!,My gf doesn't get their humor but I love Tim & Eric. Everything they do is epic genius in my opinion. If you are a Tim & Eric fan like me you just have to have all their seasons.
3,Not strenuous enough.,"For a short workout this is best for beginners. I barely got my heart rate up there and the workout was over. The moves aren't bad, you just might want to do it twice."
5,He's the best,This tape is the best around! I workout to it twice a day. In the morning and the evening. It's very intense!
3,nice,"is smaller than I expected,we are decorating our black painted island with different designed cutting boards, fits right in, since my husbands favorite pasttime is fishing."
5,The best KVM switch available,"I tried a different brand KVM first and it was DOA. This one works great. Very easy to set up. and best of all one button switching between computers.It has an extra USB port so you can run a common printer, etc. for both computers. Just what I needed."
4,If they played the Donnas on the radio more....,"....people would just be happier. This new album by the Donnas is a different sound from their older albums, and there's less songs about inhalants, but otherwise it's a great album. The Donnas are just the best band to get all girled-up to. Putting everyone in their place just gets more fun all the time. I have yet to play this album for anyone who didn't immediately convert to fandom."
1,Classic ..Not really,"This Classic BBC product is simply umwatchable. don't be fooled by the ""positive"" reviews it's awful...wish I could return mine"
3,"""Beware""-- ""DOUBLE SIDED""","Just warning this set is on double sided dvd's and had I known I would never have purchased it.Also depending on your taste, they are very boring as taped live on a stage, reminds you of the early Avengers the way they were done."
2,Worthless,This workbook is dependent on a website which is not available. There is no way to make this functional with out going through the whole workbook and finding resources for your child to use to complete the questions.
1,does not work,"The software does not work on my asus mypal A632. Sometimes after tabbing many times on the application icon I get a wifi meter, but when I tab it and click on one of the options, the applications shuts down and doesn't lauch for a while."
1,"Unworthy, overpriced.","After working closely with the author for one year, I would not buy this book. His knowldege is in BI is minimal, which makes me highly doubt of the benefits of anyone buying his book."
5,a+,This is probably the best documentary detailing Kenya's political history I have ever seen. A must see for any history buff or history student.
1,"One of the best anime series ever, but...","..., but we're really getting raped here. Was it 100% necessary to put out 2 DVDs (#6 and soon #7) with only 3 episodes each? Couldn't this DVD just as easily had the final 6 episodes?Marketing like this is a slap in the face to people who loyally support series (and the companies) by buying DVDs, instead of buying pirated Chinese box sets or boosting illegal fansubs."
3,USB cable would be even better,"This cable works just fine, but it is too short and it requires a serial port. Since all of my serial ports were in use with my printer, palm pilot, etc., I have to disconnect the screws/pins and reconnect each time I want to transfer data. There's no reason Garmin couldn't have created this with a USB connection. Welcome to the 21st century."
5,Review,Excelent! The GARMIN 010-10268-00 Cigarette Lighter/PC Cable Adapter is wath you need to go out there and never get lost.
5,El hombre mas rico de Babilonia,"....Probably the best book in its field that teaches you ""how to"" acumulate wealth based on a steady income any job can provide. Written in a way easily understood about things we have heard all over our lives and have FAILED to follow. I personally have followed this book's guidelines and have found that the simple rules the book contains are sound and make you head up to a very predictable future. So, go get it, you'll be happy you did !"
4,A wonderful collection of American standards,"Toni Tennille sheds her Captain and Tennille image in this collection of standards which shows off her impressive vocal skills. Never letting the orchestra take over, she does justice to both torch songs and light ballads. Recorded in just two days with a live orchestra (according to the liner notes), it is a worthy addition to any collection of great American music."
3,Linux users beware,I tried to config this on a Linux only net but couldn't do it. Had to get a friend with a Windows laptop to make it work. Turns out the problem is that the HPS3P can't reassemble packets when receiving a GET request with authentication (always lost the authorization and kept asking for a password). Hawking tech support was responsive until I pointed out their firmware was buggy. I had used a Hawking PN7337 until it died and it was much easier to setup on a Linux network.
2,Not so fast my friend!,"We purchased this box to help transfer video and it didn't work like we thought...and asked about! Okay for what they said it would do after we called back, but not for what we needed."
2,"Cheap, but unreliable and has a weak signal","Configuration and setup was not too difficult, but not the easiest I've found. The signal seems fairly week, however, and service is dropped about every half hour, even if I'm right next to the router. I then need to disable and reenable my wireless card before I can get service again. I can't figure out the problem, and I'm getting a new router. It works fine as a wired router, but the wireless is very annoying"
5,Wald # 40 Black Flashlight Holder,THE PRODUCT IS AN EXECLLENT VALUE FOR THE PRICE.IT IS FUNCTIONAL AS WELL AS LOOKS GOOD TO.IT WORKS LIKE IT SHOULD USING IT AS A FLASHLIGHTHOLDER ON MY BICYCLE HANDLE BARS.WELL MADE DURABLE AND VALUE !!
4,Great card - poor documentation,The card worked right out of the box. The one-page instructions were missing some essential information that I had to retrieve from their website. There is no software included (Windows CD is required)
4,Cute!!,"This is a cute fun movie that will put a smile on your face. Jessica Alba at her best. Story line may sound sad, but really the moral to it is, live your life to its fullest and don't let anything hold you back."
5,A true gem from Delerue,This is my longtime searching cd. I finally got it and it blows my mind! Very nice music and I'd recommend for soundtrack collectors or Delerue fans.
5,Wonderful!,I'm almost 23 years old and since I can remember my parents have been reading this book to me. Every year on my adoption day they'd pull the book out and read it to me and then answer any questions about my adoption I had. It wreally helps for those times that you just don't know what to say. I would recommend it to anyone!
4,Better for Chillout Than Electronica,"I found the electronic tracks to be a bit retro. Planet Data and Tiger Dust, for example, are good if you're looking for something that sounds like Kraftwerk or Uberzone, but nothing here is groundbreaking. However, I find great value in this CD for its many chillout tracks. The female vocalist is quite prominently used, and she is wonderful."
1,not much,"This short had no plot,or a flimsy one at best, and terrible acting. It is almost to the quality of a junior high film class. Don't waste your money."
2,A confusing outdated disappointment in its field,"Goldhaber's text, while rated highly by the ABCAis a great outdated disappointment. It is alsonot reader friendly. Most of the endnotesare dated before 1988 and very hard to find onCD Rom. The book reads awkward and definitionsare hard to understand. There is no mentionof email (even though the book was writtenbefore the web revolution). Communicationnetworks are not depicted properly. Sectionson listening, communication audits, and evencareer development are weak, inaccurate,or outdated. Anyone using this book would bewell advised to seek permission and use acommunications chapter from one of the establishedorganizational behavior texts to help thestudents grasp and understand the subject matter."
3,"Dos Game, More trouble than it is worth.","I had read about running this game on Windows using DosBox. It turned out to be more trouble than it is worth. If you are an expert at running DosBox or some other app like that, you would probably have a different experience."
3,Haynes Repair Manual,This is one of the must repair manuals for the do-it-yourselfer that owns a chevy truck within this year range.
1,Taken To The Cleaners,"This book is a bloated, padded piece of fluff. It is full of typos and errors. It gave me less satisfaction than putting 10 dollars into a keno machine and then walking away without playing."
1,dah,"what a waste of money, nothing but a bunch of words . i was very disappointed , wished i hadnt even read it"
5,WHAT A BLESSING,I JUST WANTED TO SAY HOW BLESSED I WAS BY THIS CD.GOD HAD TRUELY USED YOU PIERRE. I HAVE TOLD ALL OFMY FRIENDS ABOUT THE CD. I KNOW THAT THIS CD WILLBE A BLESSING TO ALL THAT HEAR IT.
1,disappointment,I expected warm air would be emited from the boot dryer and was disappointed when it did not. I take responsibility for not doing more research prior to purchase. My previous boot dryer emited warm air for faster drying.
4,BIKE O VISION DVD,"REALLY HELPS WITH MY FITNESS. I WATCH THE COUNTRYSIDE GO BY INSTEAD OF FEELING THE ""BURN"" THIS DVD WILL INCREASE THE TIME SPENT EXERCISING. NO MORE LOOKING AT THE CLOCK."
2,Eternity,Not near as good as most of their other cd's. Way to much volume on the singer. He hits to many out of tune notes. Sounds like he is trying to put to much emotion in his singing. Would not recomment purchasing this CD. older guy.
4,Great descriptions and vivid detail from Mishima's view,The Temple of Dawn can either be read alone or with the other three books in The Sea of Fertility series. This book does take some getting used to but once the reader discovers Mishima's writing style it is a pleasure. Vivid details and philosophical ideals are the main focus of this book. I would recommend this book to those readers seeking a new style in writing.
2,"Easy to set up, but poor video quaility","I purchased this from amazon.com and returned it. It is very easy to set up, great price, however I was not pleased with the quality of the video. It is ok, if you just want to watch tv, but I need to transfer home movies to DVD, this just didn't cut it."
2,Just one little 'gotcha!',"""Compatible"" may be a stretch in Mac user terms. I certainly am NOT used to having to power off the AirPort WAP, unplug this antenna, screw a ""key"" into the end of the adapter cable on the AirPort side, power on the AirPort, wait 20 seconds for the AirPort WAP to reboot, then remove the key and re-connect the Hawking antenna -- EVERY TIME you reboot the AirPort or a power glitch shuts it off. My clients would kick me out of their homes if I installed it! Other than that, it's the highest gain (+6dBi) omni-directional external antenna I've found for the AirPort Extreme and it works great -- if you don't mind continually running AirPort Admin to see that its being used..."
5,"Very good signal strength, tested with Apple Airport Extreme and DLink DI-524","This gives a good 360-degree coverage with improved signal strength than the Airport Extreme Base Station's internal antenna. I have also tested this on a DLink DI-524 with the same improvement. However, I've used this for only a week and replaced it with a Hawking HAI6SDA Directional Antenna as our DSL modem + Airport Extreme Base sits at one corner of the house. The directional antenna allowed me to beam the signals to the other end of the house and confine the signals within. This model is good if the your Airport Extreme (or any wireless router - yes, plug adaptors for different brands are included!) is at a central location in your home or if you need a good signal strength indoors and outdoors. The white and silver/gray finish of this antenna is also a good match to the Apple Airport Extreme Base Station and can be invisible from afar if it stands or if wall-mounted on a white background."
4,Wald basket #133,I bought this off Amazon because my local bike shop stop carrying themsupposedly because they rub. I have never had a problem with them. They are light and functional and looks great! You can zip tie the base so when you are just using the basket your base will still be there when you get back. Oh by the way its used on a Electra beach cruiser. Save ur bucks buy this one!
4,"Great source of ""insider"" information for aspiring writers","As an aspiring writer I have purchased numerous books looking for the ""secret"" to being successful. If there is a secret other than hard work, it is to be found in this book. This book enumerates, in great detail, everything from setting up a work place, starting your writing, to getting your work published. The only concern I would express, with respect to this book, is that some of the tips are clearly focused on what has been successful for the author of this book. Everyone develops there own style, thus some of the information may not pertain to you, but even if that is the case, it will still be useful to see another perspective. Overall this is a great resource for both aspiring and established writers."
2,"OK, but not that useful--Updated!","I received this case with my new etrex Venture. If came in a bundle with the Mapsource software, a USB cable and a lanyard. However, on my unit at least, the belt clip slides into a pouch on the back of the unit. The first time down the trail, the case slipped off the belt clip and dropped softly to the ground. Not acceptable! It will provide protection for your unit and the screen, the buttons are accessible, but not being able to clip it *securely* to clothing or a pack limits it's usability.Update: I just received the Micropak case from GPS Outfitters (on Amazon but currently not being sold). It's a big improvement--a belt clip and a belt loop, pockets for accessories, a carry strap, attachment loop--and the Garmin etrex *with* the supplied case fits in it snug as a bug."
2,Garmin Case,"I found this carrying case to be ok if you like cases, nothing great though. I belive it should have been included with the better units starting with the Legend. I actually do not use mine at all.Eric"
2,not functional,This case is just not functional. It is not handy to get off or to get the gps unit out of.
5,Nice for a little added protection...,"The Garmin Carry Case is a nice addition to the eTrex GPS. The case is well made and covers most of the unit with its protective material. The buttons on both sides of the GPS are exposed and easy to access and the click stick is also exposed and easy to access (contrary to another reviewer's comments). There is a belt clip and metal loop on the back to help fasten the unit however you want. Overall, if you're like me and prefer to keep your toys clean and unscratched, the Garmin Carry Case is for you."
3,"Quality product, but not all that useful.","This is a good, quality accessory from Garmin. I think it's best feature is the belt-clip. It does a good job of keeping dirt and scratches off your already durable eTrex, too; and makes it not so YELLOW. (which can be good or bad) My complaints are that the button holes become misaligned occasionally and make it a little harder to push the buttons. I think if the case fit a little tighter, it would help address that problem. Also, the plastic cover over the screen can cause extra glare. The eTrex is rugged enough that this is an unnecessary accessory, unless you need a belt-clip or want your GPS to stay bright and clean."
4,Good protection for GPS,Case works perfect for carring on belt and protecting the GPS but makes it hard to see the display at times.
1,Returned Item,"The Garmin Vista is difficult to read without the clear plastic cover afforded by the carry case. When in the carry case, I could barely read the Vista's screen at all. The clear plastic that goes over the Garmin screen was too shiney and difficult to see through when out in the sun. Also, the case is bulky and significantly increases the size of the Vista. I sent it back. Thanks to Amazon for having such good customer service and allowing returns including shipping costs. I would have been very disappointed if I had been stuck with this carry case, as I would not use it. I would have given it zero stars, but a 1 is as low as it gets on the choices."
4,Nice case - small issue with quality,"This case fits well, and works nicely to protect the GPS.The only issue I have with it is the stiching on the front window has started to come a little loose at the top. TO BE FAIR, I could be the culprit as I tend to pull the top flap firmly when seating the GPS into the pouch, so it could be attributed to my own actions.It still works great, I am just a little more careful about pulling on it now. The stiching is holding fine, and the case works great.Be aware also, that due to its design (which is sort of necessary based on the key placement of the GPS), the top corners of the GPSr are still vulnerable to drops. So if you want something to completely surround your GPS, this isn't it. I wouldn't object if they cahnged the design slightly to widen the top flap so that it would reach the corners a little more.Overall a great little case for the money."
1,wont fit 60CXS,I order a 60CXS Garmin GPS and the Amazon website suggested this case for it which I ordered but it doesn't fit the GPS.
2,Does not fit well,"The belt hook does not have a good catch, it would be easy to loose the GPS without noticing it happened. A slight change to the design could fix this issue (add a bit of a hook to the belt clip to snag on a belt or fabric). Secondly, the velcro flap is awkward. It would be easier to use if it went from the back, over the top, and attached to the front. This goes from the front, over the top, and hooks to the velcro on the back. Third, the button access is somewhat restricted. If a little more cut out for the buttons was there it would help a lot. Probably returning it. I have ordered something else that I think will work better. I like the quality of the construction over all. Final thought, I would rather not have the plastic window. If I were keeping it I think I would cut it out. It's too glossy and restricts the view of the screen."
5,Great Protector for GPS Unit,"This is a Great Protector for this Garmin GPS Model Vista. Sometimes I must remove it in order to see in strong sunlight, but the unit is well protected by the cover. I think it is a must for the bumps of geocaching."
1,These lights suck,"These lights barely deserve to be called lights. They cast a pathetically dim light. They arrived missing parts, and before the replacement set arrived, one light quit working. One star is too many."
4,Path lights,I received these as described but would advise to buyg replacement batteries as the original does not last very long
3,Cheap but... cheap...,"For the record,I'm fairly new to bassoon. That being said, as a new bassoonist, I found this reed to be lackluster at best. It takes more air than other reeds I've tried and is harder to keep in tune. On the plus side, it does stick the lower B and Bb easier than other ""cheap"" reeds I've tried. Mind you, every bassoon is different so yours may behave differently, but for my Moennig I'm going to a different reed..."
5,Great combination!,"I haven't been able to take the R.L. Burnside CD out of my player since I bought this book. As for the book itself, the photographs capture the spirit of this unique and wonderful label. Its mix of down-home and down-town reminds you that the blues is still vibrant, fluid, and alive."
2,Arrived Broken,Arrived broken in the box. Wasn't screwed onto its base and had two broken seats and scratched exterior.
5,Thank you Rita!,"I found this book in South Bend, Indiana of all places - on a shelf in the hotel restaurant.I swiped it, meaning to read it and put it back before flying home.Well, I kept it.Sorry, Marriott.....But this is a really good book and I intend to read it again and share it with my friends.True-to-life characters and situations, with a nice, light touch.thank you, Rita, for a really great read."
4,Mellow Jazz and sweet melodies ...,"If you like the Lupin Series and / or the Punch the Monkey CDs (which are modern remixes of the Music of that famous Anime) AND you like jazz, then this is for you. Even if you do not know the series, you will injoy it ... I LOVE it .. this is what I would love to hear in a mellow jazzbar while having a drink ... even better is the succesor Volume 2 which has english vocals to some of the songs. Very recommended"
1,This book is christian propaganda at its best!,"This book is the Christian whine heard around the world. It is about Christians who are mad because Universities teach everything in an open fair way instead of teaching Christian values. They use the guise in the book of being republicans not wanting such a liberal teaching stance, but you can see right through it. How obtuse for this nations Christians to try and make everything about them and their religion....it is a religion, not the way of the world. It is such Christian propaganda. I was disgusted."
2,Same as previous edition...,"This book is the same as the previous edition with only the title on the cover being different. In other words, it doesn't cover anything for models in years 2000-2005. Worse, the book mainly covers the 12 valve engine, even though most Tauruses and Sables are equip with the 24 valve Duratec engine. The only useful info in the book are the specs given such as torque and capacity. Otherwise, it's pretty useless."
3,More on purpose of parkour,"Although it does have some freestyle parkour in the video, most of it is listening to the guys talk about what parkour ""means"" to them and what each others strengths are. When I purchased the video I had a preconceived notion that it would be a lot more footage of moves and jumps, so I was a bit disappointed. If your into listening into the deeper thoughts of guys who are starting and revolutionizing the sport within the U.S. then I recommend the DVD. But, if your into the cool stuff you see on the internet, then I would just stick to youtube. Just my opinion."
3,Good not great,"This book is good, and that's all it's! I recommend you look at the many first-hand accounts that are out there. One isYellow Wolf: His Own Storythis is not just a first-hand account but it is also enjoyable read. You could also look atHear Me My Chiefs: Nez Perce Legend and Historyhere you first hand accounts from many different Nez Perces, orIn Pursuit of the Nez Perces: The Nez Perce War of 1877which has the account of Gen. 0.0. Howard, Duncan McDonald and Chief Joseph. In my opinion all of these would be a better choice than this one."
5,This is great!!,"I remember a little while back hearing my school jazz band play a song called ""Sing Sang Sung"" that was really cool, so I decided to find it's original recording. Man, did I ever hit the jackpot! This disc is the coolest thing i've heard in a while. I'm not much of a fan of the ballads, but everything else is just so cool!"
4,Dickey AND Duane on Blue Sky! Fantastic!,While the sound quality on the first three songs is not great this CD is worth buying simply for the the 11 plus minute version of Blue Sky. Being able to hear Duane play on this live version is a real treat. The first cd has the standard ABB set list at the time but is finished off with a sweet 25 minute You Don't Love Me. The second disc has an amazing 19 minute Dreams and a nearly 20 minute Liz Reed where Duane and the rest of the Band are really on.ABB may not have invented the jam band but they set the standard for what a jam band should be. This recording capturers them at the height of their Duane Allman years and is great addition to any ABB fan's recording.I also recommend all ABB fans read the awesome Duane Allman biography called Skydog.Skydog - The Duane Allman StoryThis book gives an excellent background on Duane as well an in-depth history of the ABB's early days.
3,It broke after about a year,"This product just recently broke. The motor is fine, but there are two wire that hold the moving blade. One of the wires broke. I had another Conair haircut kit that lasted about 9 years until the motor went out (HC220D). The motor appears to be the same on this (I took them both apart), but the quality and engineering of the other internal parts is cheaper.The accessories are good and I got a lot of good haircuts / beard trimmings out of this. It's definitely saved me hundreds of dollars from going to the barber."
3,"Brown M. (Loves Park,IL)","I thought this book would be more interesting. I personally think that if there were more background given to some of the quotes it would be better. Instead it's just one quote after another. I would have like to know in what context they were spoken. I've read alot worse ,but i've also read alot better from this author."
5,A clever cross-over novel,"I am increasingly fascinated by a narrow seam of so-called children's books that actually touch on universal themes so powerfully that they transcend categories. Alan Garner's Stone Quartet was the last book of this sort I read. Interestingly this one also starts with ancient stone-masonry, but swiftly moves in another tangent as Gabriel (the mason's miserable brutalised apprentice) encounters and runs away with a group of mystery players. The setting is mediaeval and the hand of god hangs heavily over the populace, scared of damnation, eachother and the plague in equal parts. I absolutely loved it and soaked up the gorgeous writing and powerful characterisation. As a writer, she is less terse than Garner, but matches his serious and sombre outlook - I will say (without giving anything away) that it has a much happier ending than I had feared."
1,Not completly worthless,"after changing this antenna out several times with the motorola stock antenna on my wifi card,the results are, this antenna was a complete waste of money and is not as good as the stock antenna that came with the card."
2,Not much success with indoor range,"Although your mileage may vary, the Hawking directional antenna did not work very well for my situation.I needed a way to extend the range of my wireless network inside my house. I wanted to get reception one floor below and many rooms over from the location of my wireless access point. After connecting the Hawking corner antenna to my D-Link DI-614+ access point, I hardly gained any range - although throughput may have increased a little.I would highly recommend a repeater instead, such as the D-Link DWL-800AP+. It's a little more expensive (~$68) but you get so much more bang for your buck. A repeater is a smart little box full of electronics vs. the little bit of metal and plastic you get with the antenna. I am happily using the network downstairs in my home at high speeds with the D-Link repeater and no Hawking directional antenna. (My laptop is a 17"" Apple PowerBook with built-in WiFi and it works great with D-Link)"
3,the speaker phone on the handset does not work properly,"The phone is in a good condition, but the only thing missing is the speaker phone on the headset does not work properly. This should have been said upfront in the product details page."
1,Typo on the cover,"I bought this set for my Vikings fan friend to cheer him up after Brett Favre ruined the 2009 NFC Championship game for them. You know, the thing that every Packers fan in the world could have told any Vikings fan would almost certainly happen.Anyway, I got the set and I noticed a mistake on the cover. Shouldn't it say ""Los Angeles Vikings?""I find this an unforgivable error."
5,Great labels at a great price,"I use these labels all the time, they work well and save me a bunch of money from buying them on Amazon. I have used the cheap labels in the past and for some reason they get stuck in my printer (old printer) unless I feed them by hand, but with these ones they work as intended."
5,Always great,Great product. Cheapest on found on any website was amazon. They work great for mailing addresses and file labels. We continually use them on a regular basis.
4,nice serviceable labels,"Avery makes TrueBlock labels (coated so that they block out anything underneath the label) that I really love, so I decided to try these regular white labels too.The labels are perfectly fine. They print well with no smudges. ""Easy Peel"" is accurate - they are quite easy to remove from the sheet. Compared to the Trueblock labels I usually use though, they seem a little thinner and weaker. But they're great for everyday use when you don't need any coverage."
5,Avery Easy Peel labels,"These print very well, didn't jam my printer. Just bend the sheet a little and the edge of the label pops up for easy removal from the sheet. Sticks very well, doesn't seem like it would have a problem coming off, in the mail."
2,Smears,"After passing the heating element i my Xerox color laser, the toner doesn't stick properly. It smudges when you put the labels on an envelope. Looks bad! Can't use them for my business!!"
5,LA MEJOR DE TODAS,"PARA TODOS QUE ESTAN PENSANDO EN COMPRAR O NO ESTE CD, COMPRENLO. ES UN CD EXCELENTE Y SU CANCIONES SON BUENISIMAS. ESTUVIERON EN CAL EXPO EN SACRAMENTO CALIFORNIA Y DIJE ME LES DIGO QUE SON MUY BUENA ONDA. SUS CANCIONES INCLUYEN UN POQUITO DE TODO: ROMANTICA, MOVIDA Y PARA LOS ADOLORIDOS! ACUERDENSE DE MI Y COMPREN EL CD!"
1,BANDA CUISILLOS LA PEOR BANDA QUE A SALIDO,BAnda cuilsillos no vale la pena para escuchar. ESOS WEYES HABLAN DE PURA COCAINA MARIJUANA Y CARTAS MARCACADAS!
2,not really good to use,"I just started to use it for several minutes, at first the water flow is very good, but after a while, water became hard to pop in and most of water came out from where it goes in, flow rate out from bottom decreased very much. When I try to open it to inspect what was going wrong, the ceramic cartridge simply broke when it came out but nothing seemed to be wrong inside. Now I have to buy a new cartridge which is another $50 waste of money"
5,Tremendous little tool,"This is a great little device. It is designed so that a standard Nalgene bottle attaches to it. It can take brown, sandy water and make it drinkable. I've taken one to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness 3x, and it has never let me down (e.g. I never got any dread disease from the water). It is light, easy to clean, and so simple a 6 year old child can use it. The only drawback is (and this is not really a complaint) that if the water is not spectacularly clean to begin with, the cylinder that does the filtering needs to be scrubbed often (after 2 or 3 liters) to work at its best. Nevertheless, I'd buy one again."
5,Reliable,"It took me a couple months of going to a few different retailers and playing with everything from the MSR Miniworks, and Hyperflow, and the Katadyn Hiker Pro, to decide on what I was going to buy for myself and my girlfriend. I'm really happy that I chose the Miniworks EX. It is an awesome little gadget. I haven't used it out in the middle of no where yet, as I prefer to do some car camping and test all my equipment out in the safety of civilization first (to make sure I'm using it correctly, as well as everything is working fine). I may buy an extra ceramic filter, just in case, but I have a friend that actually had a boyscout drop one from the back of a truck while they were unloading things, and he had no cracks or issues. So my take is that, although ceramic filters are less durable, they are not AS fragile as some people make it seem."
5,Great water filter,"I used this filter to provide drinking water for 2 people for about 10 day's in Alaska, it worked flawlessly. The only thing was, you couldn't get in a hurry"
2,Sloooow...,"Several friends and I recently did a 4-day trip in the Bitterroot Mountains. One friend brought his Katadyn pump and I brought this MSR. Both filters provided clean and clear water (though it's hard not to in the mountains of Montana), but his Katadyn was much much much faster than this pump. Pumping at regular speeds, he was able to fill three 32 oz bottles in the time it took me to fill one. By the end of the trip, everyone, including myself, was using his pump exclusively. It has yet to be seen how well his filter holds up vs mine and how well the product itself stands up to the abuse of being stuffed in a backpack over and over again. However, based on what I know now about the speed alone, if I could make the choice all over again, I'd go with the Katadyn."
4,The Fields - self-titled (Fallout),"Originally released in 1969, this lp was The Fields only effort the power trio had ever put out. The album reportedly came and went like a thief in the night. Some might tag this CD reissue as 'acid rock'. Tunes I was most impressed with were ""Bide My Time"", ""Take You Home"" and the eighteen-minute {took up the entire second lp side} semi-experimental bluesy ""Love Is The Word"", which is worth the price of admission alone. Line-up: Richard Fortunato-guitar & vocals, Patrick Burke-bass & vocals and Steve Lagan-drums. Might appeal to some fans of Blue Cheer, Cream and Iron Butterfly. A decent pick."
1,cheap plastic,"I used this about three times over 3 months. The wheels are very cheep plastic, and break very easily. This unit is more like a walk behind that was adapted for tractor pull. If you baby it, it might last a season or two. Otherwise buy one that is an actual brand."
5,"RIVER ROAD II -- Recipes from Baton Rouge, LA","I am delighted with this book -- fine condition, great price and prompt delivery. It is exactly as described.I would be pleased to deal with this merchant in the future."
1,Don't let the title fool you,"As a new kayak enthusiast I bought this book thinking it would be a thoughtful and insightful study of kayak touring. However, it turned out to be the account of an Eskimo's conversion and subsequent missionary work upon becoming a ""born again"" christian. For those looking for a story of faith and devotion within the Christian religion, particularly of the missionary and evangelic sort this would be fine. However, it has nothing to do with kayaking and has a very western stilted view of northern native culture and lifestyle."
4,Denso A/F sensor - worked,"Short and Sweet...Once I found out exactly which part I needed for my 2000 Toyota Sienna, popped the old one out and this guy fit right in. I was back driving without CEL in under 15 minutes. Saved about 60 bucks buying from Amazon."
1,The Scandal of Being Published,"I was so excited to read this book about the fascinating woman, Isabella Stewart Gardner. Her home now museum is a masterpiece.Douglass Shand-Tucci's book unfortunately is a droning joke. That he could take such a fascinating woman and make her a bore to read about is a shame. I paid the used price of $.01 and think it was over priced.The cover looked ever so hopeful..."
3,Why didn't I buy it when I was there,I recently visited New Zealand and hear the Stellar CD. I don't know why I did not buy it when I was there. I really liked it and now that I am back in America I can't really get it for a reasonable price. It was a good CD. Unusual and had a great sound.
5,"Yay, required French","Book was in good condition, with minimal writing that wasn't distracting. I bought it second hand for my French class and it was a good deal, cause I save a bunch of money."
5,dub mix is not available for free on the net anywhere!,"im glad i can still get this, the johnny vicious dub brings back great memories, the dub is the only mix you cannot find for free anywhere,"
4,Cool for exercise and play,"I got this trampoline because the ones specifically for kids had too low a weight limit. My son weighs 80lbs and the limit on most was around 75lbs. He and my daughter (who weighs in around 42lbs) have had a ball on this! In addition, I can use it to exercise and it has proven durable and able to handle all they throw at it. Great choice!"
1,Dave's Worst,"I am a huge Dave Mason fan, I forgot I had this cd. I have never listened to it until now, and wished I had'nt. This is without a doubt his worst recording ever. Drum machines and horns? How could it get any worse? There are 2 or 3 songs that he doesn't even play guitar on (somebody else does). This is nothing more than glorified pop. Yuck! I'm going to forget I listened to this cd. His new live stuff is awesome and a great remedy for ""Two Hearts""."
5,Still using these pants after 5 years!,"These are excellent around - the - house pants. In fact, I just wore them to bed last night, and I bought them about 5 years ago."
4,Northern New Hampshire,"Having spent the first 18 years of my life in Lancaster, New Hampshire, I found the book especially captivating as Blood, the main character, and his ilk represent my roots! Jeffrey Lent portrays in chilling detail the incredibly hard, ruthless and bleak existence in the early 1800's and one can still sense these qualities today in the land and in the people of Northern New England. The book gave me new appreciation for the steely determination and toughness of my ancestors which Lent captured so beautifully. It's not an easy book to read as it draws one in to the suffering of Blood and the girl, Sally. I felt as though I was literally living with them throughout."
1,"Not enough Victorian detail, insight, or characters!","The Warden is certainly not the best example of the writing of this period and limits its scope to the church environment. It is therefore, somewhat limited, and never really delves into the lives of the characters, other than the Warden, who is tormented by a challenge to his moral integrity and reputation. We really need more characters that are better developed and a more complicated plot. This is somewhat simplistic, and therefore not challenging reading."
2,O.K. but others much better!,"With three new books out about PCOS I eagerly looked forward to this book. What good info! Easy to read! Maybe too easy? The information found could be found in intro articles about the condition. the other two new books out at the latter end of 2000 are much more information for the ""in need of info patient"" If you know very little this book is a great start, if you have the basics down look elsewhere."
5,Very good,"This is a very good book. There's something the author could improve on in the next version. Examples in the book don't seem to encourage good programming practice. E.g., two consecutive if-blocks should be combined into one if-elseif-block for performance reason because only one IF is valid judging from the context. Some identical processing is done on the WHILE line rather than before the loop. Performance shouldn't be a concern for a beginning programmer but if it doesn't take much to teach, why not? Other than this, this is a very well written book."
3,Not what I expected...,"""Amelia Takes Command"" seems like a completly different Amelia book. Sure, the drawings are the same, but the content is totally different. Young kids look up to Amelia, and your role model shouldn't be ignoring a bully. If you are being bothered by someone, you should tell a teacher or an adult. Also, the whole space camp part seemed just like school. It was mostly about space, there wasn't any ""Amelia"" in it, just lessons. I am really disappointed in this book."
3,OK,"This book was pretty good, but I liked the all new Amelia better.I like all Amelia books. When I was reading it, I wanted to know if there was a real space camp that Marissa was talking about...."
5,Fan of Dr. Brian Cox,"Dr. Brain Cox does a wonderful job in this series. I highly recommend the purchase to any person with serious interest in planetary science. It is an excellent addition to any DVD library. Dr. Cox is quite the science communicator in this decade. I was especially pleased to see the series visit the meteor impact site in Middlesboro, Kentucky. If you want to lean more about planetary science, this DVD is the ticket."
3,Slightly Dissappointed,"I was so excited when I received this DVD series. I still haven't watched all three, and have only made it through 1/2 of the first DVD. However; I was a little dissappointed with the narrator of the film who seemed to be a camera hog, and talked, and talked about the universe while he traveled the earth. Only when they allowed me to see the universe and all it's glories was I in awe! There were a lot of comparisons made between the earth and the universe; so that we may understand the likeness, and be able to better identify with the things we don't understand. I guess I'm not really interested in those comparisons, but more interested in the differences, being that those things that defy what we are used to is what makes me love the universe so!!"
3,A Mixed Bag,"There were some fascinating moments, but I was put off by the amount of footage of the host staring off into the distance, unpacking his luggage, eating, etc, or his persistent cheshire grin. Sometimes less is more.We need a ""David Attenborough of physics"", rather than Brian Cox and Briane Greene. Someone who knows how to stay (mostly) out of the video frame."
3,At least it is a good read,"To my knowledge, there is one mistake to point out in the synopsis. I do not beleive the author ever reached the level of Deputy Director of the CIA. The book is a good read, however, it is also a little sensational. Readers should remeber that is only one man's story, and there are many other sides."
2,The book is for preparing the interview,"This book is to prepare the interview for the employer who recruit a SAP Basis Administrator or the candidate. In my opinion, this book is not enough for SAP Basis Certification exam preparation. Buy this book before the interview, but not the certification exam."
4,Worthless book,I cannot imagine how this book is on the market. It has nothing useful. Looks like the author has collected info from user groups and put together trivial questions. I was very disappointed and wonder how this sort of book is being sold on the market. This book has 2-3 lines of answer for every question and every question is printed on a separate page to make the book look fat. I would never recommend this book to anyone.
1,Waste of $$,"This book is not worth the cost. About 25-30% of the book is list of OSS notes and t-codes (which you can just look up from SE39). The page size is about 6 * 9, with like a 12pt font, with 1 question addressed in each page with not so elaborate answers. This book is probably worth $20. Again, DO NOT BUY."
2,Hawkwind - 'In The Beginning' (Charly) 2 1/2 stars,"A cheezy compilation that is meant for die-hards only.A bit similar to their 'Early Daze' disc(see my review)although the sound quality might be a tad better.With eight(8)tracks to boot,there are a couple of decent 'mixes' here.You know how Hawkwind's compilation CD's often feature DIFFERENT mixes or edits of CERTAIN songs?I sort of liked ""You Know You're Only Dreaming"" and ""You Shouldn't Do That"".Other than than,it's pretty much cutting room floor material.For the $1.99 however,it's really sort of worth it."
2,More like a comedy,"This movie is totally low budget. It's not very scary, more like funny and gross. And why after all the lead character goes through, does he STIll look as if is ready to go to a job interview at the end of the movie? I kinda enjoyed watching it! I've seen worse."
1,Nice to look at but real D U L L,"I bought this one and I liked it OK, it has some nice tech aspects and is better than later JR films that are so talky I fell asleep. but this one is still dull. I mean, the effects impress, and the action is good when it happens... but we get so much driving and walking and talking. I lost interest. Hames Black was good in a badly written role."
1,P. U.,"Loved Dawn/Day of the Dead. I even loved Zombie. I greatly looked forward to Zombie 3. But this movie was ATROCIOUS. One minute you have the traditional slow moving zombie, next minute they are jumping of roofs and talking! No plot. No continuity. This movie was just plain bad. Stay away from this steaming pile of crap"
1,the worst engines ever built,"do not by these engines, there terible. im a mechanic for 20 years and have never been stupid enough to by one of these, or instal one for a penny pincher customer. i have had to diagnois many, the use of lead shims in the cam jurnals was the first thing that caught my eye, these engines are worn out blocks that can't be repaired. and then recon trys. i thought they went out of buisness, geuss not. do not by these engines they won't make it down the street. i know from experiance."
3,No good for photography.,Beautiful flag but when I used it as a backdrop for Graduation photos it disappeared. Fly it high and proud bit do not expect it to show well in photos.
2,Don't buy,I bought this flag to have it flown the flag is cut uneven which makes it 10 time harder to fold.
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"Fantastic instrumental album by the incredible Ray Charles HOWEVER this disc is not a re-release of the 1987 Atlantic release which incorporated six tracks from a different album, ""Genius After Hours"".Fourteen tracks are indicated above but in fact there are only eight - the eight tracks of the original ""The Great Ray Charles"" album from 1957.Amazon don't offer the ""Update Product Information"" option for disc contents, so I'll post this instead. I'm returning my copy as a result, so maybe they will have corrected the misleading product info by now.If it's the original eight tracks of ""The Great Ray Charles"" that you want then go for it! This is an Atlantic/Rhino edition from 2004 remastered very well by David Donnelly at DNA Mastering, and with original sleeve notes plus contributions from David Ritz and Joel Dorn."
5,outstanding,"I have read hundreds of books on prophecy through the years.Two books have stood out as basic,logical,interesting and foundational for the student seriously interested in Biblical Prophecy.One is ""Maranatha"" by Renald Showers: a detailed study of the Rapture. The other is this book by Arnold Fruchtenbaum.You may find some statements almost shocking,but on close study,I believe Dr.Fruchtenbaum is correct.I only disagreed with about one per cent of the conclusions.This is a ""must have"" book for the serious student.My only criticism is that extensive scripture is quoted throughout the book and the verses are not numbered individually.The last one fourth of the book probably could have been ommited."
5,The Footsteps of the Messiah,"A truly wonderful and thorough resource. An absolute must for the serious Christian who wants to grasp the sequence and importance of prophetic events; both those fulfilled and those awaiting fulfilment. The author takes a dispensational, pretribulational and Premillennialist position."
1,BOGGLE,I made the error of not checking the system requirements and this game does not translate to Windows ME.
2,32 bit in a 64 bit world,"I hope they upgrade this fine game. Windows 7 and following OS does not like it. Too bad, excellent games."
3,Monarch Butterflies & Violins,"A step up from a home video, this documentary of the monarch butterfly's annual migration to Mexico captures the winter habitat beatifully. Also well documented is the local culture and people responsible for protecting the butterfly sanctuaries. An excellent resource for anyone who wants to learn more about the amazing migration of monarch butterflies."
1,"Pop meet Goth, Goth Pop","Take Avril Lavigne in ten years when she is trying to reinvent herself and you have Collide. Replace her guitar with that annoying reverb vocal effect that Cher made so popular a few years back and you have what I call Goth Pop.Really, by the time I got to song 3 I was totally annoyed and was wondering how much the resale record shop would give me for it."
4,strong piece of work,"Collide is incredible, organic, electronic, and haunting. Chasing the ghost relys less on catchy refrains and more on creating sonic worlds. Its an experience. It takes me away. There isn't anything terribly negative, but none of the songs beg to be repeated. Its solid all the way through and cannot point out a favorite song if that helps to determine what this is. I think I am blinded by their remix of Front Line Assembly's ""Predator"" and have yet to hear a better song from Collide."
3,Seeger in the rough,"I like Pete Seeger's rough voice (he's older) on this CD, but the songs themselves are a bit too unfinished for my liking. We have other Pete Seeger CDs that we enjoy more."
5,WONDERFUL CELTIC STRINGS,This is wonderful New Age Celtic String music. Very mind-transporting and ethereal.
4,Harden,"Good story, enjoyed the by play between the brothers. But if you don't like Diana Palmer you will not like this"
2,Not what I expected,"The book appears to be a collection of disparate lectures or essays loosely tied together to take advantage of the spike in Islamic interest due to terrorism. The book title is deceptive, as it is actually the title of a single chapter in the book, which refers to the 1855 battle over the Ayodha mosque site in India. Although the book does shed light on Bahraini, Saudi and Indian Shi'ite communities (only the Twelver sect, however) it never provides a strong sense of Shia ""politics, culture and history"" as implied in the title. There is some relevant information on Iranian, Iraqi and Lebanese Shi'ites, but not the level of detail I expected. You will learn something if you read this book, just understand going in that you will have to read another book if you want an understanding of modern Shi'ism. There has got to be a better organized, more focused and concise resource available."
1,Don't bother unless you're a surf rock completist,"Despite wearing the PEBBLES moniker, this is as far as you can get from a garage band compilation! Veering from the dark recesses of America's high school garages, this volume instead reissues ultra-obscure surf rock tunes. Unfortunately, this time round the tunes have remained obscure for a reason: they all try to be the next Jan & Dean or The Beach Boys. A few cool songs, including The Dantes' ""Top Down Time"", still don't justify purchasing this one. Skip it and move on to the real PEBBLES!"
4,Mike's Barracks Bad Boys,"Alex Buchman writes a great book as described by him, nothing less. His stories are reasonable, believable and well written. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
2,Too many ballads/Solas needs all instrumental CD,"This band has too much slow stuff for my taste,Gaelic Storm blows these guys away with theirEnergy and Drive!I have reviewed all of Solas's stuff,they shouldcome out with an all energetic instrumental CD,then I might buy it."
3,Pretty good but nothing exciting or groundbreaking...,"I'm a big Sevendust fan, which is why I bought this CD. I have to say that the sound and structure of thier songs are pretty good, vocals are good, but everything seems very similar to some of the bands these guy's left. Overall, I'd say I'm pleased to pick this up for $6 off amazon's marketplace...but frankly, that's all it's worth. It's worth a listen or two now and then but would I ever go to see these guy's live? No. They're just not very exciting. I commend Clint Lowery's bravery to leave an established band like Sevendust for new aspirations but I personally think it was a grave move. Dark New Day just doesn't stand out in any way. Pretty evident by the fact that they seem to have disappeared after releasing this CD over years ago."
3,Not quite what i expected...,"When I heard this band was comprised of former members of Creed, Sevendust, Skrape, Stereomud and the lesser Doubledrive, I HAD to buy this. The song ""Brother"" is great hard rock and an excellent choice for a single. The discs' opener ""Taking Me Alive"" is believe it or not, even better. My only complaint with this band...The guy seriously only yells in the first two songs and then maybe once more in another song but that one sucks. It's like false advertising. If they woulda kept up the kinda music from the first two songs I'd be giving this 5 stars, but as a rock ""supergroup"" this isn't gunna cut it. I'm not saying I don't like the other song because he doesn't yell, the other songs also lack the style and catchyness of the first 2...i duno, make up ur own mind, I'd download the first two and skip on the rest."
1,Avoid,"Aside from the song, ""Brother"", this CD is not worth your money. I'm not attacking these guys on a personal level, but anyone that appreciates music will see this CD has no flow. It sounds as if a few guys got together and created some decent riffs and then hastily hired a singer to apply lyrics so they could pump the thing out. The result is just as I said; a few good bass and guitar riffs and lyrics with religious overtones and no feel to the whole thing. There is nothing clever or conceptual about their music. Nothing lasting or memorable. Nothing worth your hard earned $. If this band has as much talent as the reviews that I read here all seem to say, where is the 2nd release? There won't be one."
4,Rock to the core,Very much a rock CD with some screaming as most rock has. A great CD for hard core rock fans.
2,ZzZzZzZ bor-ing...,"la de da..what can be said about such an awful band? nothing memorable in the least on this record, just a bunch of crap that would make the likes of creed shudder. wow, here's an idea; lets take a bunch of d-list rockers, put em' together, and let em' produce their own record. yeah, that'll sell. too bad it totally backfired on them (i saw dark new day in the bargin bin at tower's used store last week). If a million zillion other bands hadn't already done the exact same songs 11 times over, I'd say dark new day was original. but they're not, and I won't. although i must admit, i did have a soft spot for the song brother. fyi, the rest of the album sounds nothing like it, in case you think like me. boy howdy, that just about wraps things up i suppose. if you like dogs**t on wax, please get a copy of dark new day's 12 year silence. all others, avoid."
3,I enjoyed this Blu Ray but...,"Most of the songs are winners but I didn't care for some of the videos. About half of the videos were animated. The animation is on par with silly flash videos that are all over the internet so I wasn't too impressed by any of them. I also though the video quality of White & Nerdy wasn't very good which was quite disappointing since that is one of my favorites. The videos with Al in them are very good, I was just disappointed because I thought he was going to be in all the videos. Overall I did enjoy this and I'm glad I bought it as I'm sure I'll watch it again."
1,Please-no RAW 2!!!,Read it and weep just didn't make the cut becuase of its cheesyness. i am a kid! i know! Parents: Don't waste your hard earned money! THINK ABOUT IT! Un real. I know whata hgh school is like! Not like this! Palese no RAW 2!
4,Great product,"This is the ultimate waterproof MP3 player. Easy to use and light weight. You don't need a case and your iPod is never in harms way. I don't use the headphones. Check out the H2O Audio headsets, they are a great combo."
1,Problems with the volume and stereo,"I bought this to use while swimming laps. The volume and the stereo keep dropping out. Half way through my swim, I can barely hear out of one ear bud. I was constantly trying to re-adjust to hear the music. It was very annoying. I rarely use it now. If I become a regular at the pool again, I would probably look for a better product to keep me company."
3,Problem was that ear pieces fall out ... see my resolution,The main issue I had was with the player and the inability of the ear pieces to stay in place. This was finally solved by buying a neoprene headband. If you swim laps be sure to buy a neoprene headband.
2,Boring,"Ok, 3 rating with 5 stars? Come on! This movie is so boring, has barely a story and the acting is very poor! I think you rated this movie 5 stars because its nearly all girl-girl action! Basically a young girl goes to her aunt (she passes herself as a virgin) but she does all of her aunt girlfriends (and the aunt as well) and in the end of the movie she gets angry at everybody and leaves, that's it! The sex scenes are really poor! The story (what story?) is silly, and there is way to much pubic hair (ok, it was the 70's)..."
4,Lacrosse Fundamentals: A Solid Lacrosse Program!,BACKYARD LACROSSE gives an excellent initiation to thisgreat sport. Lacrosse fundamentals are covered with enthusiasm anddemonstrated with an appreciation for the game.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
1,Pain in the neck,"These labels are a pain. They fold over on themselves, are difficult to remove from the backing and hard to put on."
5,Glory Hallelujah!,"I have been waiting for years for this to be released on any format. It is a crime that it has taken this long, but the end result is worth the wait. Aside from a deplorable lack of extras (I personally would've liked to see them include the two ""All in The Family"" episodes that centered around Maude but at least I know where I can find them).At any rate, what can I say? Bea Arthur has never been better. She is simply a comic genius. I particularly delight in the ""discussions"" between Maude and Walter which usually begin at a pretty easygoing level and gradually erupt into volcanic intensity. This is a master class in comedic acting. No one ever did a pregnant pause as expertly as Bea Arthur (a technique that she went on to wield with even more finesse on ""The Golden Girls"").So to Sony I say ""thank you"" and now let's get all the remaining seasons in short order. We've had to wait long enough, it's the least you could do."
1,So bad,"Gold , Amazon , Women .. any movie with such elements should become quite a thriling adventure unless it is this movie .Starting from the lame script and less then B-movie acting , this movie is so boring and the little action is ridicules .Sometimes it is so bad it is funny like when someone is supposed to be flying in a helicopter but you see stand still tree reflection on the window .The production is very poor with teribble locations , customs and extras (apperntly the Amazonas is populated by Africans) and to top it all the sound is bad and the picture quality worse (with lots of ""snow"" in the beggining) .This title is so bad it gives bad name to all other B-movies , stay away from this one ."
1,something major missing,"Oh dear I wish I'd read these reviews before I bought this book; somehow I had the impression that the SAMs books where good introductions to subject.Yes, there are typo's in the long sections of code that you have tp type in yourself - which is worrying.Worse than that there would appear to be some major details missing from this book. I am stuck on chapter 2 now (I'm not a complete dimwit) as there would appear to be a major differenc between running xml files on your hard drive and running them online. The examples I am working do work when I test them on my pc - but when I uploa them to the web - nothing. I cannot even find the vaguest mention of any software/activeX controls I may need to install on my server to get the damn stuff to work.Deeply infuriating - I'm going to take it back I think."
1,Not up to SAMS standards,"SAMS Teach Yourself XML in 24 Hours is a weak and confusing presentation. From the second chapter which combines Active X controls, HTML, XML, and whaterver else the author decided to throw into the pot, it is difficult to follow. I tossed this one after the third Hour."
2,"Poorly written and organized, a little good beginner info","I bought this book hoping to have the foundation of XML explained in an wasy to understand fashion. The beginning chapters start off rather well, but then the book goes downhill. Unfortunately this book explains things only very briefly and then gives you pages and pages of XML code to read over. These long pages of code are confusing to someone who needs to learn XML in the first place. I would look elsewhere for a beginning book."
2,Postcards for home printing,These are a little too thick/heavy weight to easily feed into a home printer- I recommend purchasing the box of 400 which are slightly lighter/thinner but still sturdy enough for mailing and feed into a printer much more easily.
1,caused my printer to jam,"Don't buy this product. After printing off a few pages, the printer wasn't able to spool the postcard paper anymore for printing and it kept jamming. I'm now left with hundreds of sheets of useless postcard paper."
4,Overall a Good Product,"Overall a Good AC Adapter for Toshiba Laptops, Working fine. No Issues at all and cheap too. But its having Shorter Power Cord compare to original adapter from toshiba."
2,Review,"The adaptor works good, but it emits an obnoxious buzzing noise when it is plugged in. Other than that, it arrived quick and works fine."
2,Wait for the second edition,"While I think that Dr. Amoroso is quite intelligent and obviously knows his subject, his writing style is typical of a Ph. D. One of my favorite sections is found on page 153:""A given packet P might therefore be processed using approach A if one instance of P is detected in a given sampling size, versus being processed using approach B if multiple instances are detected in the sample. Another example is that a packet P might be processed one way it it follows packet P' and another way if it follows some different packet P.""There is good information in this book, but it appears that the author's desire is more to impress us with his vocabulary and intellect then to convey infomation."
1,TOO FLAKY. NOT RECOMMENDED,"I don't know if you could consider my review a fair review, being I didn't go beyond page 25, but I'm going to tell you why. It was too out there, too flaky. Going to find a wise man who can tell the village people ""how a plague learned to count"". Come on! It was like Neanderthal man asking questions in the only way he could relate. It's suppose to of taken place in the ""Year of the Tiger 3,337 (A.D. 639) but you get, ""....a Great Root of Power, if such a thing exists, will probable be worth it's weight in diamonds and look like a dog turd."", modern day garbage slang/terms. Some 92yr old woman calling YuLu ""The Imperial prick"" IT DID NOT JIVE. It did not flow in any way. I could see that even if it had a convincing story it would be a job to read, not a pleasure.I realize this book is billed as ""A Novel of an Ancient China That Never Was"" but I found it to be FLAKY. Flat"
5,A lot of fun...,"IMHO, this book is a cross between ""Snow Crash"" and ""Lord of Light"" (I don't mean that in a negative way: I just happened to read these two prior to reading Bridge of Birds), in that it is as fast-paced as the former and as epic and poetic as the latter. Extremely entertaining!"
1,WARNING...,"this is the worst gba game i have ever bought no ive ever played. i used to play bomberman on my ps1 and that was fun so i tried bomberman tournament(gba), which was a great game. the adventure mode is very easy and the battle mode is very fun. but this game is just stupid, the battle modes are karbon battles, THATS NOT BOMBERMAN!! they made it 3-d which makes it look worst. also the adventure mode is stupid, long and amazingly boring. if you want a bomberman game get Bomberman tournament, no matter the price this game isn't worth it trust me, i got it for $$ and now i want my money back. im trying to sell it."
2,Brosnan et al,"Following five successful years as Remington Steele, Pierce Brosnan had missed the opportunity to take over the James Bond role. His role in Noble House was right for him, but these shoot'm ups (always appearing with a beard, apparently to offset his ""hunk"" image and be a ""real"" actor). These two movies have little to recommend them. In the first, Brosnan's character seems secondary to that of Stewart Patrick, and has no depth. In the second Stewart is not there and Brosnan's character becomes dominant by default. A viewer would have difficulty caring about Brosnan's character in either movie."
1,OMG This is horrible,"My wife is watching this as we speak and were it possible to go negative stars I would. Easily the most ridiculous premise and worst movie I have seen in a long, long, long, long time. I was rooting for the snake."
1,More of a toy.,"This Wald 139 basket is more for show than utility. It does not hold much weight without drooping down til the handlebar brackets are vertical. Maybe I am used to Walds big basket, the 157. This one is very weak build wise. With 20 lbs in it, it will weave back and forth with minimal movement of the handlebar. Not happy at all with this basket. Another problem is the included hardware, it is soft metal, and looks like it come out of the early 1900's. The handlebar bracket hardware would be so much easier and stronger if it came with allen bolts and aircraft self locking nuts. I will be installing new hardware to see if I can shore up the weakness in this ultra lightweight basket.Guess you can't expect much for 20 dollars."
1,SMALL BASKET,WHEN I ORDERED THIS BASKET I THOUGHT IT WAS BIGGER THAN IT WAS I GAVE IT TO A PERSON WHO WANTED IT HOWEVER IT SERVED ITS PURPOSE
5,chill electronica at its best,"Learned about Grouse through Pandora, loved it so much I ordered the album. Beautiful downtempo chill electronica, with awesome stereo headphone effects (get yourself a good set of headphones when you listen to this). Highly recommended for fans of chill or triphop music. Looking forward to more Grouse albums!Note: I bought the CD rather than the download because I like to choose my own settings for ripping."
4,review,my 2 yr old nephew loves pictures of baseball players and the game of baseball so it's perfect.
1,Do not buy this!,"I bought two of these as birthday presents for kids. I wasn't expecting them to be the best made products (seeing as how I was buying them for children). However, I did expect them to last more than 1 week. Both of them quit working almost immediately! Definitely not worth the 1 star, but I can't rate it any lower than that!"
2,"Missing items that are in the description, never did get","Product description clears says includes neck strap, which was a big selling point for me because it was for my young son. They sent me another package, but again didn't have the neck strap. Never have received the neck strap that it states in the description!!"
2,Not really perfect,"Thsi lady Bettina yeap doesnt give up on life but she does not know how to choose the right men in her life fooled by their looks & style disregarding their inner values.The book was a bore, I was never excited to finish it to the end but I did, it adds nothing new to danielles profile except waste of our money & time."
1,such a rip off,I've now had two of these and both have lasted me less than a year - which is way too freakin' short for $30+ bucks! While they were still working (both just up and stopped working one day) I would usually have to attempt connecting many times before it would work.
1,If you have SP2 - be wary,"Plugged in, new HW found, but a problem occurred (code=1) when installing - strike 1.Tried to installed driver from CD for WinXP (dated 2001!) - after installation - system unstable, now getting code=31 from adapter.Tried to uninstall driver or roll back - both failed.Called Startech - they chose to not test with SP2 beta, and are only now testing.Am returning as not compatible with SP2!"
2,Didn't work with Polar S610i heart rate watch,"I bought this for use with my Polar 610i heart rate monitor watch I bought a few years ago. Couldn't get it working under Windows XP or Vista with my watch. From what I could find searching google after the fact, there appears to be something incompatible about the IR chipset in this unit.Amazon was great with the return. Bought the more expensive Polar 2006 (2.0) irUSB unit and that worked fine for me."
3,Not great,The edges on the cards aren't really smooth. The cards are a bit thin as well; thicker than resume paper yet flimsier than card stock. Perhaps I should have bought a grade or two up.
4,enterprising,the book deals with the concepts about third world those that would be alien to someone living in the developed countries of the world and therefore is an interesting guide to the problems found and faced here by the inhabitants.
4,An impressive sound for not much money,"Got these for Christmas this year from my brother. I used 'em first with a portable MP3 player which doesn't put out that much power and they still sounded really good. I just got them home and set them up with my desktop computer and WOW am I impressed.Nice thumpy bass, nice crisp vocals, and perfect size for desktop use. So I decided to look 'em up on Amazon to see how much he spent on me. Heeyyyy.... was he ever a cheapskate! Flaws: previous reviewers have noted the lack of a headphone jack and the weird placement of the bass knob on the back of the subwoofer. I'd also like the cord between the subwoofer and PC to be longer to allow more flexibility in placement. But wow, when I think of the ... little tinny 2-speaker sets you can get for this money..."
4,James Brown Live from the House of Blues,WOW I was able to see an advanced copy of this show today. The picture and sound quality are absolutely great. The original recording was in HDTV. James does all the great hits and the band looks as hot as ever. Probally the best quality live recording of JB I have ever seen.
1,PRODUCT RIP-OFF,I TRIED TO PLAY THE DVD ON THREE DIFFERENT VIDEO SYSTEMS AND THE RESULTS ON ALL THREE WERE THE SAME. THE VIDEO PORTION WAS DISTORTED AND SKIPPED FRAMES. THE AUDIO ALSO SKIPPED. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PURCHASE.
3,Flawed Applicator,The labels are a great idea. They are the only labels in stores right now that print all the way down to the hole in the middle of your CD. Unfortunately they only work with the Afterburner Applicator which is poorly designed. It's the flexible gizmo that takes a lot of practice to use correctly and even then it prone to air-bubbling and difficult to get perfectly aligned and centered on your CD hole.
4,Perfect to celebrate the winter Solstice with,"I chose the rating of four stars because I like most of the songs on it, so it was well worth my purchase."
1,By far the worst movie *ever*,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen (and I've seen a few horrible ones!) the acting was terrible, the plot completely absurd and unrealistic, this is definitely NOT a D/s movie. I too am giving the movie away, I refuse to let anyone who is bent on seeing this movie actually pay for such an awful thing! (like *I* did) And I most certainly will never watch it again."
2,Not what I thought it would be,Usually Geddes impressed me - but too much repetition- plus the CD included -ehhh it was included- baby didn't like it nor did I
1,She calls this a miracle?!?!,"Some old fart blows his beans up her muff, and the end result is a 'miracle'? Give me a break. If that's a miracle, so is taking a dump...which is pretty much equivalent to the entire recorded output of this over-marketed, overrated, so-full-of-herself commercial twit."
2,Characterization (warning--contains spoiler),"Since Susanna Moore opens this brief novel with heavy refs to irony, I suppose it's reasonable enough for her streetwise narrator to get ripped off and then whacked by the very people she should be hip to.But there needs to be more development of the anonymous narrator to make her shift from skeptic to gullible runoff victim believable. It could be believable if the author hadn't skimped in the middle. There's no development that could make the transition believable, so it's not. There are a lot of wasted words devoted to what could have been a subplot re Cornelius, but this text seemd by the end to have been a poorly-developed red-herring in the detective aspect. This author may have talent but needs to go to the gym."
1,"Sly, vacant , and dark exercise","I expected this book to be grim from the outset. The dark sexuality did not bother me. What did bother me was how soul-less the book was. Franny, the main character, is caught in some malaise without any depth. The author, Susanna Moore, gives some hints to Franny's past with hardly any elaboration. From this superficial treatment of Franny's inner life and her past, the reader is to focus on Franny's present journey. This sly, seamy escapade is merely an exercise. You don't care about Franny, her detective boyfriend, her student, or even the rash of murders in their wake. The conclusion is violent and stupid.The author elicts no emotion for the characters and the story is not interesting enough to justify this failure on her part."
1,Not To Bother,I gather Meg Ryan must feel that shooting a movie based on this book (if the movie follows along) will revive her career like Unfaithful did for Diane Lane.All well and good....the book is pathetic...erotic garbage written with some style
1,A Rose by any other name ...,"Despite what Moore may have had in mind while writing this novel, her combination of florid, poetic prose and graphic sex and violence just don't mix. This book is the literary equivalent of a snuff film. Never mind what Moore was trying to achieve (and her radiant, angelic author photo on the hardcover edition makes it seem as if she sees herself as literature's savior)with her story, underneath the prose, there is a by the numbers thriller full of red herrings, the obligatory surprise revelation, and a violent, sick ending that tries to go one better than ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar."" Whatever Moore was trying to say gets lost amidst the gore and sex. This is a novel best forgotten."
2,Feminist noir leaves an empty feeling,"While Moore has a flair for dark descriptions of NYC nightlife and the singles scene, it seems evident she has no interest in characterizing heterosexual relationships unless they involve males as ego-cruising masochists and women as depressed suicidals. Darkness in noir fiction is fine but here the characters are so segregated into stereotypical holes that I found myself wondering about the author's view of the real world rather than those of the characters. Still, it manages to intrigue, and the dialogue is crisply written. My biggest complaint, however, is the ending which, without giving it away, is unexpected and quite unfair when you consider the book was written in the first person. I felt cheated, that the author was laughing at her readers. Yes, rules may be made to be broken but readers still expect a modicum of fairness and the final page disregards that."
4,"Detachment, even from one's self","All through this book, I kept remembering ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar,"" who's heroine was a similar academic loner woman whose private life was geared towards one-night stands with inappropriate men, but there were also elements of ""Repulsion,"" the movie by Roman Polanski, about a woman's surrender to madness. I think you'd have to be a person who has experienced that level of detachment from your self to appreciate this portrait. It's really unrealistic to expect a happy ending for someone who has abandoned themself, don't you think? I wonder if the author named her protagonist Franny after Franz Kafka, as there are definitely elements of the absurd and the surreal. Expect to hate this book if you are a life-affirming person, but try to feel a little empathy, too, for someone so lost to the possibility of connecting with others."
2,Strange series of musings punctuated with sex,"I didn't like this book because it didn't make sense to me. The main character didn't behave in a coherent way and she kept putting herself in risky situations, though she would be the type of person who you would think would be more savvy. It was almost like she was looking for trouble or casual sex. maybe both. The ending was bloody, unexpected and abrupt. It just didn't ring true for me."
1,Unpleasant to say the least,"Despite being warned, I gave this book my time. And what a waste of time it was. This book was the worst book I have ever read. The writing style was jumpy and choppy. The choppiness of the writing made it difficult to follow. The ending just creeped me out. No wonder the movie bombed - even with Meg Ryan. And why would an actress like Meg Ryan want to be involved in such a dark, yuck, story? Warning! This is very sick stuff and not at all sexy or erotic. I hope to never again read about a murderer who likes to cut the nipples off his victims to save as ""souvenirs"" and all sorts of other unpleasant crap. This book was CRAP."
2,Not Erotic and Not a Thriller,"Moore can write -- well enough to keep the pages turning and to show that she has a brain. But I think she's squandered her talents with this book. The purported ""eroticism"" isn't much more than uninspired pornography, and the ""thrill"" is pretty much nonexistent, with an ending that is easy and not particularly surprising in the way that a good, intelligent crime/mystery is when it rises above its genre. The narrator is so detached and flat that it's hard to know or feel much about her -- and while that persona may have been Moore's attempt to reflect her ultimate ending (which I won't give away here), the end did not justify the means. I was annoyed that I had to endure a gruesome scene with no payoff, and that I wasted my time reading this book at all when I could have been reading something much more original, complex, and interesting. Not recommended."
1,Just Don't,"Very poor movie quality. Every movie on this collection is bad, from the picture to the sound. I was very disappointed that they would actually sell an item as bad as this. The sound fades out to nothing, and when the sound returns, it is impossible to hear it, even with the volume up all the way. The picture is grainy........don't waste your money like I did."
5,Adventure and Sex in a land of magic,"I was surprised to find that Sinbad, Ali Baba, and Aladin were not a part of the original Arabian Nights. I read a translation of the stories as a child and wanted to reacquaint myself with them after becoming an ""adult."" I must have read the PG version because the stories now are much more involved with magic, adventure, and sex. Did I mention sex? It appears that every story has some in it. Sometimes a lot of it, but not in a necessarily graphic way.Each story has some interesting twists in it, and there are enough demons and mystery to awaken the adult child within all of us. Some of the stories follow the same general pattern, but each is unique unto itself. The only thing I can say is that curiousity is many a character's downfall. Read it and you won't be disappointed."
5,Great Collection,"I am still reading through these wonderful tales and enjoying every minute. The tales are intriguing; full of wonderful imagery and colour for the imagination to play with. These tales are also delightfully bawdy and naughty in parts, making for a good giggle in the magical mix.However if you get this you must complete the set by buying the second batch of the more well-known stories -The Arabian Nights II: Sindbad and Other Popular Stories (Everyman's Library)Hasain Haddawy's translation of these tales is the only one worth getting. Excellent fun."
4,It's OK,I bought this book after reading several reviews of several different translations. My 87 year old mother is confined in a skilled nursing facility and my thought was to read several stories to her each time I visited. The stories are short and the ending is always a cliffhanger. I find the language in this translation to be a bit stilted and there are times when I alter the language is I am reading aloud to make the phrasing sound more contemporary. Overall though I am satisfied with this purchase.
2,Inconsistent sizes,"I expected two motors that were exactly the same. However, I received two different sized motors with very different weights. Not ideal for my use."
1,Too Flimsy,Ended up not using them. Not what I expected. Made my own post cards using 1/2 sheet photo paper and 1/2 sheet shipping labels.
5,The Reality of War,"Recorded in 1982 and unsuccessfully marketed to major jazz labels, this forgotten gem had a very limited release two years later. The session tapes were lost or destroyed, hence the CD is remastered from vinyl.The title track runs the gamut of emotions, as the infectious beat and Sub Ra's rap delivers an urgent message of reality by facing the dangerous games played by political powers and those striving for entrance into that club.Retrospect has a slow and moody texture, but is a very accessible musical piece. The cover of Duke Ellington's Drop Me Off in Harlem is outstanding and the big-band swing in Nameless One #2 is a great change of pace. But it is the vocals of June Tyson - Sometimes I'm Happy, Smile - that takes the album to tremendous heights.The Outer Space Arkestra is well-grounded in soul and jazz, with Sun Ra showing that he can work within a less experimental framework, but still deliver a timeless classic."
2,"Accurate tracking, terrible scrolling","After receiving this mouse, I plugged it directly into my computer and everything worked perfectly. The tracking was incomparably good to my previous Microsoft wireless optical mouse. The scrolling (vertical and horizontal) was good until about a month later when it felt as if something fell out or became dislodged. When this happened, vertical scrolling was practically impossible as sometimes when you scroll up it would go down and vice versa. Editing large images in Photoshop as well as switching weapons in FPSs is a pain."
3,Snow shovel review,"This shovel was good enough for our light snow in Albuquerque, NM.But it is very light and could be too ""cheap"" for real snows- especially if they are hard packed or icy.Definitely did the job we needed here."
1,Amazon: More info please!,"Amazon, you cannot sell CD/DVD labels UNLESS you provide an image of the label layout on the sheet. Avery, Memorex and Stomper all sell various label configurations under their own brand names. Unless you can see a sample sheet, you don't know what you are buying. Amazon, buck up. include a sample layout with every CD/DVD label set you sell."
5,BEST version,This is the best version I have ever seen of The Nutcracker. I would pay any amount to have this on DVD. I cannot sit through any other version of The Nutcracker because none can even compare to this superb version.
1,sycophant wannabe,"This guy is a sycophant wannabe! He has never gotten close enough to interview any of the Beatles or anyone remotely related to them. He fancies himself a spiritual being but doesn't mind exploiting the Beatles with lies and gossip for his own financial gain. He passes judgement on George Harrison's faith, all the while feeding off of George's life for Giuliano's god....money! What a hypocrit!"
5,Sexy!,"Nicole Knight, a former successful fashion model, is at a great point in her life. She has finally managed to sign a book deal, her creative juices are flowing, and she's semi-dating a nice man. And then she meets Antionio Santiago, People Magazine's ""Sexiest Man Alive."" Sparks fly from the beginning, but it's going to be a rocky road for the twosome. It's not easy to date a man that everyone in the world seems to want a piece of!I bought and read this book within 24 hours, not because it was short, but because I absolutely could not tear myself away from it. Nicole Knight, the heroine, is a brassy, intelligent woman that I rooted for throughout the duration. And what a man Antonio was... I'm giving extra credit to Kellie for writing all of the song lyrics herself. By the end, I had almost forgotten that the characters weren't real people and that I wouldn't be hearing the songs on the radio the next time I jumped in the car."
4,"Good book, but bogged down by details","This book reveals many life experiences that shaped Lee Kuan Yew's worldview - his family, the Japanese occupation, British colonists, and Cambridge years.However since Lee is a lawyer by training, he tends to focus too much on details. Those little details may be important to historians, but may make the average reader bored.If you are interested in Singapore economic rise since independence, you should read the second volume of Lee's memoir: 1965-2000: From Third World to First."
2,rather bad english,"the subject of the book is great but the english sucks. future authors should be aware that they have to be able to write a book in proper US/British English. ""kiasus"" might say that it is mr lee's typical writing style but honestly, what more could be expected of a kid who was raised and breed in colonial singapore.......a kid who once adored his british masters. seriously, mr lee should get himself a respected editor in his future writings."
2,For total beginners only,While not useless this book is best suited to the totally inexperienced fisherman. There information is very basic indeed. See my other fishing book reviews for much more useful sources of information to beginning as well as more experience fishermen/fisherwomen
2,Disintegrated,"I bought this a year and a half ago, and maybe used it a handful of times withwarm water or ice, and always let it airdry.Worked well and kept a good seal. Last month I got it out again after not having used it since the winter, and the inside of the bag had completely disintegrated, almost like a dry rott. Very disappointed since I really liked them."
5,GOOD OLD FASHIONED HELP,I JUST HAD KNEE SURGERY AND HAVE TO ICE THE KNEE CONSTANTLY. THIS IS A NICE EASY WAY TO DO IT. IT WORKS WELL AND REMINDS ME OF THE ONE I USED WHEN I WAS A KID. A GOOD BUY!!
2,Very stiff and scratchy,"I purchased 2 of these. Unfortunately, they are very stiff and scratchy. They are not comfortable against bare skin. I just ordered 2 Mueller Ice Bags. They are much softer. :-)"
1,it leaks,"granted i bought this 8 months ago, but it leaks! It didn't initially, but now, every time I've tried to use it, it leaks. Buy something else!"
4,Ship with ease,These labels are easy to print on and block out any information underneath them so you can ship without worrying. There are 250 in the package so you can ship a lot of packages with just this one package of labels. I highly recommend this for businesses.
4,it is what it is,These filter liners are basically coffee filter type paper cut to fit the Acme juicer. A little clumsy to get in place at first but they are what they are.
5,Sonic Impact i-Fusion Speaker System,I love the product and I especially loved the fast shipment. Highly recommend the product and Amazon. Thank you. Mary
5,Amazing!,"Bought this for daughter a few years ago as a gift. Amazingly great sound and so portable that we all use it! Daughter takes it to track and cross country meets with her as the kids seem to break into spontaneous dancing probably as stress relief. It goes out to the hot tub, I find it in the bathroom as the kids were listening to music getting ready for school in the morning. My husband has hijacked it now because he got an Ipod for Christmas (we've created a monster) and he likes to torture us with his tunes as we're cooking dinner or eating. This product has paid for itself many times. We ordered the new version last night for my husband, can't wait to see and hear it. If it's anything like this one, I'll be giving it 5 stars as well!"
4,Like Product,"We use ours a lot. It's great for fresh vegetables. I haven't experimented that much with other things but it's quick and easy to use. The only thing I would change are the pictures to include the other pieces. There are two other pieces inside that aren't shown in any of the pictures. Also, a small recipe book would be nice. I ordered it anyway, hoping for the best. I got what I wanted (except the recipe book). These make good gifts, especially for the price."
4,Useful,I use this one only for cooking oatmeal and have not used it as a pressure cooker. I also bought the Nordic Ware Microwave Rice Cooker 8 Cup for $11.00 and like it better because it's sturdier but is smaller than this one.
2,Needs improvement,"the Stomper cd labeling system is good but could use much improvement.The labels do not pickup reproducibly on by HP Inkjet printer because the label stock does not go allthe way to the edge of the backing sheet.I have used hundreds of sheets of the labeles and I have come to these conclusions.This problem has caused me to waste dozons of pages of the labels. The tabs on the labels come off too easily sometimes making it very difficlt to use the stomperThe software that comes with sucks. I use Surething CD labeler Deluxe 3.12 in place the enclosed software.The applicator works well but does not usually give perfect centering. I find that it is usually off by ~1 mm.In summery, I miss the IBM labels that they stopped making."
2,was not what I expected.,"cd/dvd labeling system was not what I expected. there were no dvd lables, just cd labels. Did get the labeler and that was what I wanted the most."
1,False Advertising,"I ordered this ""Complete Kit"" naively thinking that the box would include what it said it included with the label applicator: ""24 white matte labels"" and ""6 white matte inserts"". For the price I paid, and what the product image showed on this site, I expected to get what I ordered. Instead I received a box with a sticker covering over the original contents list, giving a modified count of only 4 CD labels, and no inserts at all!People, before you purchase this item--or any item here or elsewhere--make sure you get what you pay for.Because I certainly didn't."
1,Surprisingly Bad,"I had high hopes for this movie seeing the acclaim it received from various circles.Well, the proof is in the viewing and this one is not worth the bother.What starts out as a great setting with some wonderful cinematography soon turns into the run of the mill humans-running-and-hiding-from-creatures-who-can-make-mince-meat-out-of-them. Gee, how original?Throw in the very tired crisis movie cliches, which others have referred to in their reviews and what could have been a great movie becomes a snoozer. Avoid this one. It's not worth your time."
2,movie purchase,I cannot give a legitimate review of this purchase because as of yet it has yet to be completed to my satisfaction.
3,Vamps are bloody again,"After seeing all this bloodless Twilight movies, it's nice to have a vampire film, that shows of what their diet is made of. I can't quite put my finger on it but something is missing. If you watch the film it seems like some parts are missing which gives the movie a kind of incomplete feeling, on the other hand Danny Houston as lead vampire Marlow is (as he is in every character he plays) a revelation. So if you like your vampire diet bloody and if you are sick and tired of all this sentimental stuff that's going on in other vampire films sink your teeth into this one."
5,Best Vampire movie of all time,"I wish they make more vampire movies like this, scary, fast and ruthless... The actors are great, the location is great and the story is good."
4,Like the story and the cap,"Very good story with intriguing sub plots that, I wish,could've been developed more. I know that time limitationswill cause some things to generally remain underdeveloped.Found the characters to be convincing in their roles and waslooking forward to the sequel. Nice cap."
1,retarded vamps?,this movie sucks so bad esp if ur a fan of vamps the vamps speak in some never heard of language why? who knows also they look like they all have down syndrom the ending was stupid really stupid theres only one good gore scene
4,"A Far Cry From ""True Blood""","Lately I've been watching the new series on HBO about Vampires that's titled ""True Blood."" Those Vampires have been welcomed as members of society since they can survive on an artificial blood formula. Those Vampires can get a little nasty, but in general they're not bad people, for being the walking dead.The vampires in this movie really come across as the monsters that they are. And even though the movie isn't as scary as your general slasher genre it does make the vampires seem like pure evil with no sense of humanity present at all. In fact these vampires are every bit as creepy as the one in the silent movies years ago. Not only did they seem pure evil, but their teeth were more like shark teeth instead of a couple little fangs.....Very creepy.I wouldn't let a younger kid see it because I think it would cause a lot of terrible dreams and sleepless nights if you're the parent. But for adults....It's a pretty good freak show..."
4,Fresh chapter in vampire lore,"What makes a horror movie fun? In-depth character development or story originality? Maybe both, but if I had to choose one over the other I'd go with story, and that's pretty much what what we have here - an original chapter in vampire mythology with little character development. However, I didn't mind so much the lack of character development; afterall, when I go to see a horror movie, I'm pretty much looking for 'horror' and this film delivers plenty. Do I care that I don't know too much about these characters or why in the heck they'd want to live in the northernmost town in North America? Not in the least. I wanted to see vampires relentlessly attack a helpless town and watch as the inhabitants struggle to overcome such a dire situation. That was what kept me in stitches, and that, my friends, is good horror."
2,IS IT THAT TIME OF THE MONTH AGAIN? !,"'30 Days Of Night' has a good premise, great setting and solid special FX, but it's a poorly executed film! The film starts out interesting enough, but soon turns into a ridiculous and amateurish horror movie with no real tension. 30 days fly by 7 to 9 days at a time with so many people getting killed in the first few minutes it should have only taken half a day to kill everybody in town. It doesn't feel like these people have been trapped anywhere for more than a few minutes! OK, they added facial hair to the men to imply some time had passed, but the time element and isolation were completely forgot about. This was really a missed opportunity as this could have been a really intense film! It turn out to be a pretty mediocre film with one of the stupidest endings I've ever seen in a horror film! Watch it on cable if you must see it."
3,30 Days of Night,"The movie had a very good idea, but I don't think that it was articulated very well. I do not think of vampires as undead monsters that just go around hissing and growling, just my opinion. I feel that the movie would have been a lot better if the vampires would have been more like Viktor from underworld, as if he were on some type of rogue blood safari. These vampires were more like zombies that were on a liquid diet. The acting from the humans was not bad, but not good. I would recommend this movie for someone that likes lots of blood and killing, but not for someone that kinda likes vampires and see them for more than zombies with fangs. Thanks."
4,Very good,"The obvious standout tune is Funkasaurus, but the whole thing is very good. This is good to listen to while working."
2,Sonically Sabotaged Aida,"Yes, this is a great performance, and I'm not going to explore what most listeners have already found out for themselves. What amazes me is the plaudits this recording has received regarding its sound quality. On a high resolution system, this recording is a disaster. When the music is in its quieter moments, the fizz of distortion is startling; in the louder moments there is a dramatic and unpleasant volume increase, and even though in these louder parts clarity and tonal bloom improve somewhat, the haze of distortion around the singers does not. For a mid-price reissue, Opera D'Oro has not done its customers any service. The slipcase, artwork, and libretto cannot balance the unpleasant sound; nor can the fine performance, for that matter, which is a real shame. This is great singing utterly sabotaged by the sonics. Just what are the reviewers who have complimented the sound listening with or through?"
3,Not a bad product,"Although this product is intended to be used for guns, I actually plan on using it for fishing poles. Overall I am satisfied with the rack but there are a few things that trouble me slightly. My biggest concern is that installing this rack will prevent you from opening a rear sliding window if your truck has one. Another problem is that the head rests on the rear seats prevent me from using the bottom racks to store guns or fishing poles. (The truck the item is installed in is a 2007 F150 SuperCab). The product easily holds two fishing poles on the top rack, one facing in each direction but it is still disappointing to completely lose the use of the bottom rack due to my headrests. As I said, over all I am satisfied, especially if you consider the reasonable price."
1,Planned obsolescence,"Copyrighted in 2001, the Cisco CCNP library has already been rendered obsolete by Cisco themselves. Not only exam revisions, but a fundamental structural change to the CCNP examination series has taken place in the short time since these books were put on the market. Unfortunately, I can see no other benefit to these books beyond providing a revenue stream to Cisco. There are better books available if one is looking for truly educational technical books rather than exam-specific guides."
4,good enough to pass..but many errors,"while i agree wholeheartedly with the other reviews on the number of errors in the books (specially the routing one), i must say they were good enough for my to study and pass all 4 tests. but as always, a second sourse of info is always good to have. the web (...)is a great place to confirm any piece of info you might think is wrong in the book."
1,i don't recommend this!!!!,I bought this at gander mnt. last year and i took it hunting a few times and the whistle broke in three days the rubber was ripping and the whistle fell out..
3,Nothing suprising,"The topics dealt with in the story have been already treated thousands of times : a man avenging his father, a love story between a rich ""gringa"" and a poor latino, cops crossing the line for the good cause, etc. Even the portrayal of Dominican Republic is not devoid of the usual clichés : rooster fights, bachata, etc. In the end, the movie is not unpleasant but kind of conventional, and does not convey any surprise"
5,RE:La Soga,La Soga represents an effort to make great Dominican Movies. I enjoyed every minute of it and hope to see more of these type of movies in the future.
3,Too Hard To Control,"This is fun, but it's too hard to control. I prefer a stiffer control like nascar then a touchy one that spins you every time you touch it."
3,"Pretty good overall, but can't use at work","The kit went together fairly easily. It doesn't exactly snap together, but with the glue and some rubber bands to hold the pieces tightly in position, everything came out looking well and the blades could freely spin. You'll have to study the instructions closely to make sense of the pictures.Under the product description, it states the turbine will also work under desk light, but I could not get the blades to turn until the solar chip was about 6 inches away from a bright incandescent light bulb. We don't have that kind of desk lighting at work, so I was a little disappointed that I will not be able to use the turbine at my desk as I had intended."
3,Not suitable for the tropics,"This brush is excellent and really does stimulate the scalp. However the bed is made of rubber and cannot take much heat. Mine started coming apart every time I brushed my hair. I always had specs of rubber to pick out. I eventually ended up purchasing a substitute made in China, because my country is pretty humid. Other that, it worked wonders on my hair and my nine year old."
4,The whole world loves Italian BUDDY GRECO,"If you're a BUDDY GRECO fan, this is for you! The first BUDDY GRECO album with no classic songs or hip versions of ballads. I never heard one of these songs before. All recorded with some Italian friends of BUDDY GRECO. Listen to surprising songs as NEW JERSEY, NICKELODEON RAG and THE WHOLE WORLD LOVES ITALIANS. This is once more the cream of the entertainers. Want more??"
1,Way Beyond the Good Days,"No vocalist had the vocal punch and drive of Buddy Greco....but that was countless years past. By the time this CD, Walk A Little Faster, was recorded, that vocal distinction of Buddy Greco was sorely lacking. This CD, to this reviewer, is a grave disappointment. Save your money."
5,First time buyer - GREAT CARS!,"This was our first purchase of Automoblox. We questioned whether they would hold the interest of our grandchildren and if the quality would justify the cost. The Automoblox did all of these things and more. The both our grand daughter and grand sons played with them the day of the birthday party and the next morning they were one of the first things they got out. They are simple, well made, and educational. Parts from the same size of cars interchange with any of the others that same size. We like that if a part gets lost you can order another rather than just having a broken toy. I am sure that the collection will grow with our grandchildren! The minis were the perfect size to fit in the hand of our grandson that was turning 3."
4,Automoblox are great!,"My boys 7 & 9 have many of these automoblox mini's. They really like to play with them, race them, and interchange the parts. I really like automoblox because they are NOT MADE IN CHINA and have a cool wooden toy look and feel that is a nice change. Also because they are just as nice as the larger version at a much better price! They also make great gifts.UPDATE: An observant reader kindly informed me that this toy is, in fact, MADE IN CHINA. Thankfully there have been no problems reported with these and there have been some changes in Chinese toy manufacturing over the last year or so. One executed FDA chairman and a new certification process can probably do that."
2,LOW QUALITY,"This toy only rolls with 3 wheels, it out of square, only three wheels touch the surface and one remains in the air."
4,cool looking and fun to play with,"I purchased this for my niece and nephew. It is durable, fun to assemble. I like the 3 different designs. I nice break from flashing, light up, all plastic toys!"
2,"Fascism and the Right in Europe, 1919-1945: Seminar Sudies in History",This book was very dry. Still did not have a grasp of fascism when I was done
4,Who remembers the Hudson Brothers?,"For fans of bad tv variety shows this movie is a must. The Hudson Brothers were very amusing for a comedy team but not the best actors in the world. Kate Hudson will probably be the best product from their past (yeah I know only one of them is her father but I can never remember which one). The movie spoofs just about every adventure and ghost movie that was out before it. Lots of Indiana Jones jokes. My favorite line is still a well-worn ""Your Doooooomed!"" Good movie for Halloween to get a break from blood and guts - lots of zombies, little blood. It is a comedy after all.The DVD doesn't offer much in the way of extras but the transfer is good."
4,Somethings to think about with a grain of salt,"I have not finished reading this book; yet like other reviewers I have some reservations. Bryna Siegel does a fine job of explaining Autistic Spectrum Disorders, and how it affects the development of a child. However, I find some of her conclusions and statements to be potentially misleading, especially when since ASDs are still being researched, and not much is 100% definite. Interesting theories, but not necessarily facts. Having said that, use your judgement and don't miss out on the good information and experience that Bryna does offers."
3,hey,I happened to see this kid on yahoo and I watched his video. Lovely voice. And A lovely album. The only track I do not like is the last one. Also I think his sophmore album is better than his debut.
5,Dave Koz CD,The first time I heard of Dave Koz was on a Barry Manilow CD. I also saw him perform with Barry Manilow on his last tour. I enjoyed his music so much I went on-line to find a CD of his to buy. I was not disappointed with this one.
2,Interesting first but...,I saw this movie because the actors have familiar faces in other good movies. First 45 minutes went pretty well; a mix of poetry and war scenes gave it a unique touch. Then the movie got really boring for my taste.
1,worst movie ever,I gave this movie one star because it wouldn't accept zero stars. modern war movie with old shakespearian type dialogue. It didn't work for Romeo and Juliette set in modern day why would it work for this.
1,terrible,"The worse adaptation of a shakespear play ever. Dont waste your money. And the sound is not keyed in, had to constantly turn the surround sound up amd down."
2,BORING!,"If your not into Shakespeare,you won't like this movie. The action is good, but I don't speak with thee and thou so its hard to follow."
3,A modernization of an old story,"I love movies, so when this one was available through the Vine Program I requested it without knowing a thing about the movie. While the movie is well presented and average in interest--it kept me watching--the ""old"" dialect used in it tended to make the story humorous. The movie is essentially as it is described on Amazon's web page for the movie, less the high accolades. However, it is not a movie that I would readily recommend to others unless they are looking for something different to watch. That is, the movie is OK, but I doubt I will ever watch it again. BUT I am glad I did see it, and I still love movies!"
2,Terrible adaptation,"What a horrible adaptation. Bland acting. Terrible action scenes! The actions scenes were supposed to be wars, but only had like 5 people in them...ridiculous! I thought the whole thing was just a fiasco. Redgrave was the movie's only saving grace...she is always amazing. Otherwise, a terrible waste of my time. Watch the BBC movie from the 1970s."
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"I'm a great fan of Ralph Fiennes and Gerard Butler and so I was anxious to see this movie, but I was disappointed in the film. My husband and I watched it together and both of us were of the opinion that the Shakespearean language didn't fit the story. This is an action story with battles, bombs, bullets--and characters speaking in poetic verse. Sorry it wasn't my cup of tea."
3,Well acted but hard to follow the fine details,"I'm not familiar with the Coriolanus play by Shakespeare but was intrigued with the movie plot, actors, and all the high reviews. I thought the acting was amazing, in particular by Ralph Fiennes. The problem that my husband and I had was following along with the finer details in the movie. We got the big picture, but we still had a lot of questions since we couldn't follow along with a lot of the dialogue. The actors speak like a Shakespearean play reads and I remember having to read through slowly and sometimes several times to understand the writing. Therefore it was really hard to understand when they were speaking fast and sometimes so passionately. I think it's a unique movie and well done, but I feel like I was missing something while watching it. Kind of makes me think back to the days I lived in Japan and could understand half of what I was hearing and had to fill in all the gaps myself."
3,Enough already of modernistic Shakespeare,"From WWII (Richard III and still incredible), to slovenly Prohibition gambits to this version of Coriolanus (? Eastern Europe) - these remakes of Shakespeare in modern guise are getting a tad predictable - what next Hamlet set in the Aliens spaceship? The acting, is superb inevitably with Ralph Fiennes in the lead - Voldemort does Shakespeare??As my schooling in the UK involved mandatory Shakespeare - I cannot take too much of this pretentious drivel - although Richard III remains an exception"
1,waste of rental money,we could not watch it - sounded intriguing but so incredibly boring and hard to understand in the first 10 minutes - we had to turn it off - WASTE OF MONEY
1,Really bad,"This movie really caught my interest. Looked like a great story, watched the trailer, looked good. I even saw the catch line ""Shakespere's Coriolanus"", I thought man an old roman shakespere story in modern times, how cool is that? Imagine my surprise when the dialog was in something like 16th century English. Lost interest in 10 minutes, to hard to follow. Kind of like watching a Chinese movie with no subtitles but worse because you can almost follow whats going on. Frustrating experience. My fault I guess, I should have somehow intuitively known that the movie would be in a 500 year old version of the language. Baaahhh"
1,Love Shakespeare but..,"I love Shakespeare but there was way too much dialogue in this movie. I didn't even get to the half way mark. The acting was great, action was excellent. I just couldn't deal with the language among all that was going on."
2,Make Them Cry Will Make You Cry.,"You will like this book if you do not read a lot of suspense/ mystery/ thrillers, or if you are Catholic or interested in same. But this is just another well crafted, predictable page turner that should be set aside for when you little else to read. I was bored. Kevin O'Brian does not put enough Catholic detail into the story, and has too many points of view going on. You will remain confused until well after half way, then will find yourself reading ahead to get to the end you already know is coming. This book could have been ever so much better."
5,A book to be read in one sitting!!,"Make Them cry is definitly the type of book to be read in one sitting. People all around Seattle are being killed, with parts of their bodies missing, such as fingers and toes. One of the people who are killed is Johnny Costello, who attends A Catholic school. He is found dead one night, and it is determined to be an accident. Father Murphy, Johnny friend disagrees. When Jack meets up with Johnny's sister, Maggie, they are determined to catch whoever was responsible for Johnny's death. This search leads to a long and winding road, where there is something happening on every page. One you get to the last three or four chapters, you won't be able to stop reading. This book is one that you will never forget, and will want to pass on to others."
2,Not much Pete Duel in this book,"This book is about half summaries of the episodes, which are superfluous if you have the episodes on tape.The biggest problem is the relative lack of information on Pete Duel, whose portrayal of ""Hannibal Heyes"" was the backbone of the show's appeal. Upper management of AS&J; gets plenty of opportunity to tell the story of Duel's death their way, and Duel comes off as a trouble-maker whom no one could help but like anyway. Not fair to him at all and just too bad. I can only guess that the authors became dazzled by their access to ""insiders"" and forgot what they owed the one person who cannot speak up and defend himself."
2,Kind of weak,"You can really see the low budget in this, especially the effects. Rather average movie but it di have it's occassional moments."
3,Teapot,"I purchased this for my elderly (though spright) mother as I was certain she would like the grape motif. It is a quality product but my one reservation is that there is no device which restrains the top from coming off if you havent alot of water in it, and since its quite heavey as is, that becomes not only a problem but a danger."
4,Great Collection and Reference,I actually bought this book as a pose reference for sculpting. It contains several artist styles and poses and works great for that purpose. I am looking forward to purchasing other editions!
2,Very disappointing,"I bought ""Cool and Steady and Easy"" (BFE's previous album) and loved it; that album showed that BFE could work in lots of different genres with skill and a lot of wit. So, I was excited when this album first came out.I shouldn't have been. The collaboration with the Turks is interesting at first, but gets old very quickly. The songs all sound alike, and don't have the hooks and twists that ""Cool and Steady and Easy"" had. The rhythm is particularly bad--same drum segments, over and over, not even the slightest variation. I would say a definite 180 degrees from ""Cool.."", where jazzy horn solos were followed by a hilarious reggae exposition on a social revolution delayed by, well, just being tired.So, if you're looking for a first album to buy from BFE, pick up ""Cool...""--that one's a winner. If you're a total addict, okay, you might like this release. I'm kinda picky, and deserved better from this otherwise creative band."
3,Smells like Northern California (but they were from Virginia!),"Remember all of those half-baked jam bands on SST in the late 80s? Well, this is an enjoyable record by one of the better ones. The tunes are sketchy but fun, the performances are earnest (fighting the laid back undertow), and they make excellent use of a horn section, particularly on ""Mass Man"". Those horns are my favorite thing about the record. Serious debits: vocals, words, the ****ing congas. As Robert Christgau wrote (about a different group), ""I experience an undeniable pleasure so mild I'm not sure anyone would want to pay for it."" At these prices I'd give it a shot."
5,Great bookstand,I love my bookstand - Now I can eat at lunch and read at the same time - Before it was such a hassle to try to keep the book open while eating - It is sturdy and folds down for easy transporting - I love it
5,A Great Cookbook Holder,A replacement for one that was lost. Right price. Folds and slips into the drawer. Holds Betty Crocker and other cookbooks just fine.
4,Good and cheap,This book stand does the job for large and small books and it is easy to adjust. It's smaller than other stands and can easily fit in a book bag.
3,Book stand is handy for propping up book while leaving your hands free.,I like to read while eating and this works fine for moderately thick books. However it has some drawbacks. You have to be careful to turn pages and it won't work for thick books. It is not adjustable -- I guess it was designed for displaying a book.
2,"It""S OK for something flimsy...","A light magazine, a few papers, or a paperback book are OK, but NOT a THICK text or a cook book, which I really wanted a book stand for!"
4,Rocks a bit...but does its job,"I bought this because it was cheap, and it does do its job, especially for the price. It rocks back and forth a bit, so it always takes a little adjusting, but other than that, it is great! It is easy to store, and holds small books, big books, hardcovers, and paperbacks! Great product!"
2,Trouble holding large books open,"This book stand's wire is sturdy enough to hold large books, but the design does not hold the pages of the large book open, which is rather the point of a book stand. For example, this stand cannot hold my Fannie Farmer cookbook open to a the griddlecakes page. Nor can it hold open my collected works of Jane Austin. The book stand also can't hold small paperbacks open. However, if you are certain that you will only ever only want to read medium sized books, then this is the stand for you."
2,Bought two - rarely use them,I thought this would be a perfect reading tool but I find the stands to be cumbersome and unwieldy. I like to have several books open at a time and thought this would be a great tool for writing papers. But the stand tips over easily and it actually takes up quite a bit of space when it's fully extended.I bet there are better products out there.
2,Just NOT okay.,Looking for something better. Would not buy again because it doesn't hold pages down; which is key feature I wanted.
4,Awesome IPad holder!,"I bought this to use in the kitchen for my IPad, when following recipes, and when charging. It makes a perfect inexpensive stand."
4,Makes my life easier,"How does this study stand make my life easier? Well, I'm a grad student and I spend most of my days either reading or working on my research, so I was always fighting with book spines whenever I had to quote passages. Not anymore! I didn't give it five stars because I wish I had the ability to change the incline on the books. But hey, I'm not complaining, it does the trick, it holds the pages and it just makes my life easier."
4,I really like this stand,"Got my package really quickly, everything was included & I was using the product in a matter of minutes. Thanks!"
2,Not for Spiral-Bound Books,I was very happy with the price of this book stand.I have been using it with a spiral-bound paperback book. I end up having to balance a clipboard behind the book to hold the book up so I can read it. The pages are also very hard to turn. I have damaged the bottom of my pages by using this book stand.I am going to purchase the plastic $11 one from fellowes which is also highly rated. I have that one at school and have been very happy with it.I do not recommend this book stand for books. It would probably work well for a tablet computer or Ipad or something. I will hold onto it in case I buy another product to use it with.
3,Nothing special here...,"Basic generic dance. I like ""Tell Me Girl/Boy"" but it's not fantastic. I think Collage's best work is ""Can't We Try"" with Rockell, which is sadly not included on this CD. There is nothing wrong with the vocals, the lead singer has a strong voice, it's just that there is nothing new here."
2,A Collage of Mediocrity !!,"If you're looking for old freestyle songs that bring back memories of the short-lived Freestyle/Latin Hip-hop era, than this is the perfect c.d. for you. ""I'll Be Loving You"", ""Gangster of Love"", ""Diana"" and ""Tell Me Boy/Tell Me Girl"" were all popular hits in that scene. From a musical perspective, the songs are all similar, cookie-cutter ""Planet Rock"" knockoffs with trite lovey-dovey vocals set in minor with similar, very simple chord progressions. ""Cheap Thrills"" and ""From Here To Eternity"" are perfect examples of producer Adam Marano's attempted compensation for creativity with weirdness. I don't know why they call this ""freestyle"", when it is anything but that."
4,This was awesome,This book was filled with fantasies I couldn't come up with on my own and it was GREAT!! my boyfriend also got quite a kick out of it and made for some interesting conversations and erotic nights.
2,Didnt live up to the Orgasmic Hype,"I coudlve submitted some fantasise of my own, and those of close friends.women of course that would put this book to shame ...thanx but no thanx guys"
3,"Good Tunes, and Tones, But Where's the Original FRIDAY Music","When I bought this CD, I was expecting more of the original tunes, like the CH CH CH - HA HA HA, and the themes related to Camp Crystal Lake, but there isnt much of that on this Soundtrack. The only track that sounds like it's from a Friday the 13th movie is VIRTUAL CRYSTAL LAKE. But aside from that, there are some good themes, and scare tactics. There is nothing much else I can say except, if you are expecting the themes from the Original Friday, don't buy this CD."
2,Hoyle Casino,I have an older version of Bicycle Casino and I like it better. I don't care for the over all set up.
2,Crashing all the time,"The games are great, but it keeps crashing in the middle of the Texas Hold Em tournament. The worst part is it does not save the game when it crashes."
5,Wonderful Voice.. and more.,"I bought this CD when I saw her play the Irish Music Festival a few years ago.. I fell in love with the music there.. enough so that I went to all 3 days of the festival, and stayed even when it started to pour. I would like to get the other CD's as well, but this one was a great one to start with. All it's missing is the stories she adds when she is performing."
5,GREAT GLOVES,These are great gloves !!! So many from Home Depot pull apart just by trying to get them on. These really are Medical Grade. Strong and great in every way. This is were I get my gloves from now on.
1,a waste of money,I purchased three boxes -- Over 50% of each box has been defective and needed to be thrown away. The gloves are fused together and unable to be used. I will never purchase from this vendor again.
1,Dissatifed,Not happy with company. I ordered medium size gloves 4 boxes. They sent me size large. It is falling off my hands. I guess I will not order from them ever again.
2,Unhappy with there service,I am still trying to get the correct gloves from this company and haven't received them yet... NOBODY will call me directly about them..All I receive via e-mail are one-liners from a person named Ben. I am VERY UNHAPPY about this and will NEVER order from them again. Cindy Brighton
4,"great tracks, great mixing, lack of style","His mixing is near flawless, his track selection is good, but theres a lack of progression and style in this release. It sounds good, but it feels ""put together"". it sounds like he took alot of great sounding tracks and mixed them in such a way that it sounds more like a compilation than a record. CD 1 is better in this respect. it tells more of a ""story"" than cd 2. cd 2 is more upbeat, but the progression just isnt that great. great tracks though. overall, it is a good album, and i do recomend it. look into sander kleinenberg, ferry corsten, Deep Dish, paul van dyk, sasha, digweed, tiesto, or hernan catteneo. All Masters of the art"
1,Worst Action Movie Ever,"The acting is so bad in this movie, calling it ""B-rate"" would be a flat out lie. Makes Dolph Lundgren look Oscar worthy."
3,Which 'No Survivors'?,"""No Survivors"" is the name of an early GBH single. It is also the title of a full-length GBH live album. The artwork and track listing shown here are from the live album, but the description is of the single! Buyer beware!!! EDIT: This review apparently was put under The Lurkers' ""This Dirty Town"" album as well. I did not mean to review that album, as I've never heard it! Also, that album is erroneously listed as a GBH album!!!!!"
1,it worked for a little while...,"My cassette adapter worked, squeakily, for about 4 months, but now constantly autoreverses until my player ejects it. The cassette shell now has a lot of tiny bits of shredded rubber in it. I hope that's from the adapter, not my player"
1,Dud cassette adapter x2,"I tried two - I thought the first must be a fault, but neither worked in my Multipla. The tape didn't go into the deck properly and I could only get out again with a lot of fiddling."
1,Waste of Money!,"Dont buy this adaptor, it is a complete waste of money because it doesnt work. The music from your CD player or ipod has really low volume and alot of static. It is because this adaptor was poorly designed and doesnt make good contact with the tape head. I tried this in different cars and at home, doesnt work. I bought a second, big mistake. Read all the other reviews, they are accurate. Dont ever buy Belkin, it'sbetter to throw your money away in the street."
1,HUGE WASTE.....BEWARE,I've spent nearly 100 dollars on Belkin related accessories for my iPod and they all have disappointed me greatly. The tape seems to flip sides about 3-5 times through every song. I will never purchase another Belkin product again.
1,Nope.,"First I tried the Belkin FM modulator, then I exchanged it for the cassette adapter. My car spit it out of the tape deck across the console. After that it started to work, but would only play music out of the left speakers! Piece. of. crap. Belkin needs to get their act together. I bought a sony tape adapter [...] works perfectly."
3,It's Pretty Good but He is More of a Producer for others,"upon Hearing this Disc I can tell you that Raphael Saadiq is a Very Talented Cat, but He Reminds me of Babyface in that He gives His Better Material to others overall.He never captures any real Highs for Me as a Vocalist or as a Composer on Himself.Vocally He is Better in a Band Setting such as with Tony,Toni,Tone.I like His Arrangements but I think as a Solo Artist He is about 4 or 5 Years kinda late at dropping it.but as a Writer&Producer for Others He has a chance to Continue for a long time."
4,It stays true to the material.,"Yes, it's about baseball and numbers, but it doesn't try to educate the young reader on VORP calculations or the merits of combining SLG and OBP. Instead, it goes back to basics and relies on the classics: one baseball, two bats, three gloves, four catchers, five baserunners, six mascots, seven hitters, eight pitchers, nine pennants, and ten baseball caps.Older readers will appreciate the inclusion of Ivan Rodriguez as a Texas Ranger; Pedro Martinez as a Boston Red Sock; and cameos by Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire. It gives a bit of a dated feel by not including future steroid abusers Barry Bonds and Jason Giambi, but seeing Junior Griffey and Randy Johnson more than compensates.The tension builds slowly but progressively, and culminates in a finale you won't soon forget. I know I won't... or can't.-Fred"
1,Disapointing Altogether,this is the first O'reilly book that I've been disapointed with! Too many purposeless examples and some configs can be downloaded from vendors web site...am also wondering about the many PETA references for a load balancing book (just off topic)
4,Well researched and well written - and well worth reading!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, the third in Mackey's series. Her writing is wonderful, and the extent to which she researches her material is clear in the flow of the story, and the way she weaves detail into the telling of this tale.A *very* good read!!"
4,Great value,"This is my third shredder in 2 years. So far, it has not overheated as others have commented and is notas noisy as my previous shredders. The papers feed easily into the bin and so far, I have not had anyjam incidents. I received this item in 3 days, thank you for the prompt service."
3,Decent shredder,"I bought this to replace an Aurora shredder I had for a few years as I had been satisfied with my old one. This one sounded comparable by the description, but it is not quite as good as the last one for several reasons. The capacity of the trashcan is smaller, it doesn't look as nice under my desk, and the size of the crosscut is significantly larger.Despite those drawbacks, it seems adequately powered thus far, I can't get my fingers to start the blades (which is nice when you have young children around the house), and the crosscut is small enough it would still be a hard way to steal any personal data.Overall a decent printer. Hopefully this one will last a bit longer and by then shredders will have been reviewed by Consumer Reports."
4,"Wow, works great.","This paper shredder has power. It destroys credit cards, staples, CD's, and paper like nothing else. I had to shred a few CD's just to play around. Its a very solid unit, pretty heavy. Shipped in just 2 days with the free 2 day shipping from amazon. Great stuff!"
1,Gotta be a better choice,"Screws around gear cage had no lockwashers or thread locking compound, and vibrated loose. This caused a nylon gear to get chewed up. When it was working and in use, the motor quickly heated up. After openning it, the reason became apparent. No fan on the motor."
2,Bad design,Mine worked for sometime but after shredding CDs and credit cards it stopped working. I found out that the motor is connected to a nylon gear which looses threads quickly under pressure. I wonder why company would put a nylon gear when other two gears are metal ones.
2,Works fine until it stops working,"I bought this not even two years ago, and it has already given up the ghost. For the first say year or so it worked perfectly - my only complaint was that there is no 'auto-feed' button. Well, that and that the system seemed to struggle with about 4-6 pages at a time (even though it's a 10-sheet shredder). But the main problem has come within the last month, when the system decided to stop feeding more than about 1/3 of a page at a time. The online help didn't give me too much advice, but it mentioned that the gears may have been gummed up. I spent time cleaning it extensively (there was a fair amount of paper left in the gears), but no hope. Guess I need another shredder now."
3,Medicore at Best,"This is not a bad shredder, but based on my experience there are better options. I was mainly dissapointed with how well this held up to use and how loud this shredder was. I have used other shredders that lasted for years and I only stopped using them because I wanted additional features. However, after about 2 years of use, this shredder broke. One of the cheap plastic guides inside that kept paper from wrapping around the cutters broke and paper started getting all jammed up. This is also the loudest shredder I have ever owned. I put up with the noise since it did a nice job of shredding the paper, cds and credit cards that were put into the unit. I just bought a different brand that seems to handle everything just as well and much quieter. I bought the Aurora shredder since it was the only shredder I could find that met my criteria of size of unit, size of shred, and items it could shred. Now there are other options and I will not purchase this unit again."
1,Wimpy and only lasted 6 months,"I bought this shredder in June and was unimpressed, but didn't want to go to the trouble of returning it. The description says it shreds 8-10 sheets, but it really struggles with even 5. It's now December and when I went to shred a bunch of papers, the engine burned up. Don't buy this thing. Absolutely poor quality - not worth the price."
3,Not too revealing but some interesting parts,"I did enjoy the history of the automobile industry. Lots of interesting facts and figures. What I didn't really extract from the book was Ford's leadership. The author did reference how Ford transformed from industrial pioneer to social activist but I think most people knew this already. Clearly Ford should be thanked for his contribution to the industrial growth of the USA but as a person, not many would be impressed. In summary, not a book really worth your time."
4,A great but little-known Soul gem.,"This was Eddie Holman's only album for Salsoul Records and is a very powerful set of Philly Soul. Considering that it was released in 1977 (when Disco ruled) it has many more ballads than dance tracks. Great production from Norman Harris, Ron Tyson and Earl Young."
2,smelly,"I tolerate this as an exfoliating cleanser every once in a while...but I HATE the smell, it's VERY spicey smelling...like you reached in your spice rack and threw all the smells together...I guess it just depends on your personal favorite smells...this one I don't like. It is paste like and very gritty, it gets the job done, just wish it smelled different"
1,burts bees orange cleanser,This must have been sitting on the shelf for over 2 years. It arrived looking more like tar than orange cleanser. Now I have to pay to ship it to Burts Bees at my cost to get a replacement. I will never order from this company again.
3,Good not great,Ive used this product before. It's a good face scrub but it is very crumbly. I always have to add water to it. It almost has a homemade consistency to it. Also the metal cover on the jar tends to rust after we while. I leave it in the shower so I'm sure that doesn't help.
4,Burt's Bees Facial Scrub,I would like to thank Kandee Johnson for this purchase because she inspired me to buy it :) Took very long for this product to get here but once it did it was packaged well. I used it for the first time last night and I think it will take me awhile to get used to it. You are supposed to put a little bit in your hand and then add 2 drops of water. I did that and it just seems like you need to do something else; it's kinda hard to apply to your face. I'm pretty positive that this scrub will work wonderfully though :)
5,Why did Pond's discontinue this???,I am so disappointed that Pond's discontinued this - it is the best eye makeup remover I've ever used. Takes off even waterproof mascara EASILY and doesn't leave your eyes greasy or blurry. I'm hoping they bring it back!!
3,Take off your usual thinking cap. Delta and the Bannermen is so bad it's good.,"Yes, it's that bad. Really bad. It's got a busload of 50's rockers, leisure motorbiking through cow patties, mix of bad American accents, attacking punk rockers who drink too much cherry Kool-Aid, and screaming sirens of death. If you like Ice Pirates, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Ed Wood or John Water's films, or cheese that is hot and sticky, then I definitely recommend this DVD.Please don't make this your first Doctor Who purchase, this episode should only be reserved for older fans & drinking games. It's crazy funny, I'm seriously laughing. I'd only recommend this disc to those who love Mystery Science Theater 3000 jokes, too bad they didn't do this episode. It's perfect."
4,LG BABY!,"Another instance of LG providing a quality product. Helped keep my strength up even after an involuntary layoff of almost 2 weeks. A little pricey for the casual supp user, however, if your interest in supps is only casual you don't need this anyway."
1,Buy the powder instead,"If you're loooking for a ready-to-drink shake, try a different brand. Over the course of two months I ordered two 12-packs of the Labrada shake. Delivery was prompt, but in both cases the whey protein and other solids in every carton had separated from the liquid, congealing into a chunk that couldn't be remixed by shaking the container for as long as a minute (as the manufacturer recommends.) In one instance, getting the contents out required slicing open the carton. Once the contents had been put into a blender, the shakes were satisfactory --- creamy. delicious and filling. But not RTD. If you're going to end up using a blender or shake bottle anyway, buy Labrada meal supplements in powdered form to begin with. I've found them equally tasty (although made with sugar,) equally nutritious and you'll be getting what you expected."
2,All Undertone,"David Julyan's score for the thriller ""Insomnia"" is,alas,less of a score and more of a rather monotonous undertone...One wonders if the director of this rather murky film instructed the composer in these terms;""Look,David,I don't want you to put a lot of effort into the score for my film...no..just a constant,ominous drone will do""??If you want to listen to about thirty minutes of the sort of generic ""thriller""underscore that usually is written for grade Zee cheapies,then this is just the thing,However,if you are looking for a score that is both innovative and can stand alone apart from the film itself then skip this item entirely"
3,repetitious-repertoire....,"I found Ghazal's live recording -The Rain- to be a mesmerizing fusion of Persian music with Indian Raga(5-stars). But I have been disappointed with other recordings that I have sought out,for the simple reason that I find Ghazal's repertoire to be surprisingly limited.This disc for example has only the 3rd track that is ""new"",the other 3 tracks are variations of what is on the live recording. Same melodic lines with fresh improvised structures.Sure,this is a fine recording with outstanding musicianship and thus will serve to treat the first time listener with a delightful experience. however, Iam sad to say that one only needs to own any one of their recordings and that is all. It is a repetitious-repertoire...on disc,however,this music really lives on the stage,it is a living-tradition that perhaps was never meant to be ""recorded""."
5,Wonderful historic Concert,A great DVD as advertised. I love the concert. Arrived in perfect condition. I would not hesitate to recommend this DVD to anyone else.Fabulous legacy left by a wonderful entertainers.
5,"Peter, Paul, and Mary in Concert",It is excellent. It contains many of the songs that are not played at Christmas time any more. Takes me back....
3,POOR,"Cal's voice is nice on this record,back to his normal tone,as oppossed to the high pitch of his ""Grave New World"" and ""Massacre Divine"" albums.Guitarwork is fine and the overall sound is incredibly hi-fi.But what really ruins it al is the bass and drums,sorta jamming,cuasi-funk and totally unimaginative,as if the guys had entered the studio just to jam it up,really poor.My advice,stick to early or latest DISCHARGE"
2,Not as hot as others have stated...,"I read this book recently, and I'll be honest: it took me a lot to get through it. The writing is well-done, of course, but I felt the heroine was a tad on the weaker end of ""fiery"", and the romance was lukewarm at best. There were other, smaller aspects that got me frustrated as well, but a weak heroine and a shoddy intimate relationship between the lead characters really douses my fire.I'm in the middle of my second Maureen McKade novel, ""A Reason to Believe"", and so far it's a much, much sounder tome."
2,Scrubs CD,The song list on the CD cover and disk tag does not match the actual songs on this CD. Not sure what gives on this.Probably not the fault of the vendor but the producer of this product.
4,All lovers of SCRUBS will love that CD!,"Although the ""Superman"" title song by Lazlo Bane is not the same version on the CD as in the TV series (the CD version is a bit slower), every song perfectly fits this fabulous series. It does not only contain songs from the first series, but e.g. the genious song ""Overkill"" by Colin Hay (ex-Men At Work!) from the 1st episode of the 2nd series. All in all this soundtrack is very acoustic, but even for a sytnth-pop fan like me this is a PERFECT soundtrack for everyone who loves SCRUBS.Anyway: if there should come the day with a 2nd part of that CD, please, dear producers, include the quicker TV version of ""Superman""! Thanks :-)"
4,If you love the show...,Then you'll feel no different about these songs. Perfect for any mood your in.
3,Ok story and problem playing,This movie in blu ray is just ok. First be afaid of buying any blu ray from foreign production company. I have a 3yr old blu ray and this is the only movie where it has trouble playing. At first I thought it was the player wornout. But all other blu rays are fine. So its the movie playing on my player. I believe the code on the movie make the player not play it right. If this makes sense and since this is from a foreign company. I think the movie is more geared for newer player coding.The story is just ok for me and that is all I will have to say. Jackie was ok in it. Something different which is fine.
5,Audio Video Cable for Zen Vision/Zen Vision M/Zen Vision W (Purchased on 01/10/2008),This product was priced low and shipped fast. It works well to replace the one that I lost that came with my Zen W.
4,Great addition to my Zen,This is a great little accessory for my Zen M. I usually store a couple of movies on it and this enables me to watch them on my big screen TV. The quality is excellent. I've also hooked it up to my karaoke machine for karaoke songs that I could only find in the AVI format. In most cases the sound and picture quality is better than my CDs.
2,Catalog of Hillerman places,"I was disappointed in this book. I expected a map of the 4-corners area or several maps with details. This would have been fun to use as a reference as you read the Hillerman books to follow detectives Leaphorn & Chee travels thru Navajoland. Also, the few pictures that were in the book, were in black & white. That would have been OK if they had been sharper and crisper."
2,Not for me,"I couldn't get past the first half hour; ridiculous, profane, stupid. Not entertainment for this gal; I have higher standards!"
4,The Answer Man (HD),"I was a great movie, one of those you'd watch again. Try it you'll like it, lol. Enjoyed it very much."
4,Great movie,I just loved this movie. I love movies of this kind. The story line was great and the actors did I wonderful job. Very intertaining. I streamed this movie from my Prime account through my Kindle fire. Wonderful.
3,Jeff Daniels as a cranky famous writer struggling with God,"A redemption story, ""Answer Man"" has Daniels starring as one of the most famous writers in the world - he wrote one book about dialogues with God that went viral 20 years earlier, then abruptly retreated from the fame, becoming more and more bitter about life. Chiropractor Lauren Graham (""Gilmore Girls"") comes along with a young son, and starts to turn his life around, along with an interwoven story about a struggling book store owner who makes a (pretty weak and unbelievable) bargain with Daniels to trade books for spiritual guidance. The plot is contrived, but Daniels and Graham have chemistry, and overall this is an enjoyable film, mostly because Daniels is a very watchable and strong actor."
2,Disappointing,"I thought it would be funnier, but all the funniest parts were in the preview. Started good, but liked it less and less as it went on."
2,sounds are pathetic,"The animal is great, the shape is nice - his head 'hangs' over a childs shoulder but the sounds that come with this thing are simply scary for young kids. I can't imagine how any child would be soothed to sleep with this one. Has a nice song on there but every few beats a loud roar or noise is made! really?"
5,Cute sheep with great soothing sounds,This sheep is extremely soft and cuddely. The sounds are great and I attached it on the outside of the crib. GREAT PRODUCT!!! I even got the small sheep as a baby shower gift and it is fantastic for the stroller or if you are on the road. But the bigger sheep is way softer than the smaller version.
3,OK - but could be better,"When I first received this, I thought it was GREAT. And it was, while my baby was an infant and would deep sleep every single time. I wished that it would have an option to run continously. The two timer settings are not long enough. Now that she is 7 months old, her naps during the day are not as ""deep"" and so as soon as the sound goes off after 45 minutes, she wakes up, because it's so abrupt. There is no fading of the sound. And as one other review mentioned, it has begun to short circuit now - even with a battery change. I have just recently bought (to replace it) the Graco sound machine. It's small and offers a variety of white noises and offers a timer OR to run all night. And in our small house, running all night is a must."
5,Should be a great comfort for my grandbaby,"I wanted to get a white noise machine for my daughter's baby (due in a couple of months) because I know how effective it can be for getting a baby to nap. She has a friend who has been a nanny and ""Sheepy"" was the recommended choice.It has four sounds. One is a heartbeat, another is whale songs.I was concerned that a soft item would not be appropriate for a crib or cradle, but there is a velco strap that allows you to secure it to the OUTSIDE of the crib.The sheep itself is very soft and cuddly.It was reasonably priced, compared to the other noise machine I am familiar with.I am very happy with Sheepy."
3,2 out of 4 sounds aren't bad,"This giraffe is really cute. My 2 year old loves to play with it, and it is a great sound machine for my 6 month old.2 of the sounds work for going to sleep. Then there's one that has a nice beat.And a final sound option that is really lovely, until it grunts, which it keeps doing about once every minute. It's a bit unnerving. If my 2 year old didn't keep changing the settings it would be fine.I would love to see the same product, minus the grunting, with an option to tuck the sound machine away, and with a longer timer/ slow to go off, instead of abrupt turn off.Overall I would say it is a great toy/ on the go sound machine. If you want something to use for white noise ever night I wold choose a different product."
3,"cute but would purchase a ""less cute"" nonbaby sound machine for better quality","worked fine initially, and i like that way it hooks onto crib but after a while the sounds kept shorting out, would turn off randomly, play for 5-10 sec then nothing. we thought it was the batteries numerous times but it kept happening even with new batteries. would not purchase again. going to try a regular sound machine."
1,No sound after 1.5 weeks,"I received this Cloud b Sleep Sheep only 1.5 weeks ago. For some reason, the sound system is not working. It started by shortening the sound time, then it began turning itself off right after I turned it on and then all of a sudden, it stopped working at all. At the beginning, we thought it was a battery and so we replaced it with Duracell, but no luck...Think twice before ordering it..."
2,not working properly,"I am disappointed. I purchased Sleep sheep-4 soothing sound from nature. The mother heartbeat sound is not working. When I made a return, it was said they could not replace. I hope they make refund on time."
1,Only runs on Batteries and does not have white noise,"I didn't realize you need batteries for this, nor does it have basic white noise. The sounds it emits are not pleasant. Too electronic and static sounding."
4,great sound machine,"I think this is a great sound machine. It has a timer on it, which we use every night. I particularly like the rain and wave sounds, which relax my son. We've had it hanging on my son's crib since he was born. He's now 16 months and still uses it. We just bought another one for our son who will be born in February. I like this one better than the giraffe version - of which we have the travel size. The sounds are much more soothing than the giraffe. The giraffe has more ""play"" sounds than ""sleep"" sounds."
3,Wrong Item Description,The Sleep Sheep I received was not what I expected. This one was for strollers and was smaller that the original one I purchased. The seller needs to be more specific in the description.
1,Shorts out,"We love the white noise for our little boy. He has a very difficult time sleeping without it. Ever since we got the giraffe it has randomly shorted out, but now it's to the point that it shorts so much it's not even worth turning on. Another annoyance is that there is no ""constant on"" setting--the longest it will stay on is 45 minutes. Our son wakes up when it turns off and he's definitely a heavy sleeper otherwise.The sleep sheep shorts out as well--definitely a quality production issue and not just a bad egg."
3,Doesn't stay on long enough,"Although we loved the Sleep Sheep and how it helped our little one get to sleep, the longest setting only lasts for 45 minutes - right through one sleep cycle. We found ourselves sneaking into our son's room after 45 minutes to reset the machine to drown out any household sounds that might disturb his sleep. We eventually bought the Conair CU7, which stays on all night and throughout naps, and helps him sleep longer and better. The Sleep Sheep on the Go is great for travel, but the big one is sort of a waste."
4,Nice,"We have this hanging in my daughters crib and she likes it but doesn't love it. Not a fan of the whale sound but she seems to like the waves and rain. Obviously every child is different, would give it 5 stars for cuteness and sound quality!"
2,"Its cute, and that is as good as it gets here.",I was so excited when I got this in the mail and opened it right away to put it in my nursery. The little music box didn't fit into the pocket space provided in the giraffe and because of that I ended up ripping the hardly sown on velcro strap. =(
4,great baby gift,This product is high quality and lasts -- would highly recommend! This item works better than most battery items and sounds very real.
5,Great Product,"Both of my kids have these and listen to the whale noises as they fall asleep. It calms them to have something familiar everynight and is a great ""white noise"" that helps drown out some of the other noises in the house."
5,Love ALL the Cloud B Gentle Animals,"I have received the full size AND travel size Cloud B Gentle Sheep. They are fabulous! Extremely soft and multiple sounds ranging from the mama's heart beat, ocean and whale sounds. I couldn't rave any more about how amazing these are! I highly recommend them for anyone looking for a gift or ways to calm your children."
3,Cute & somewhat helpful...,"I ordered the sleep sheep to help my 3 month old son relax and fall asleep. The sheep is really soft and cute, and I like that you can set it to play the sounds for 23 or 45 minutes, and then it shuts off for you. So far, my baby really only likes the ocean sounds; the heartbeat, rain and whale sounds don't have any effect on him. The rain sound is kind of disappointing- it sounds a little fuzzy and staticky. And the whale sounds are really wierd- I never use that one at all. Overall, I'm still glad I bought it but it doesn't always work for my baby..."
2,Cute but not a substitute for a white noise machine,"I was hopeful that this would help lul my infant to sleep to help train her to fall asleep in her crib. She did seem to calm to the ""rain"" sound, but it took her about 20 minutes to drift off, so just as she actually fell asleep, it abruptly turned off, waking her up immediately. So we purchased an actual white noise machine (which is also an alarm clock/radio), which we love. I also like that I also have options of playing the radio with it and have many sounds to choose from rather than being limited to only 4 with the sleep sheep. Though this is cute, I recommend spending money one something more practical."
3,Pretty good sound maching except...,"I really like this sound machine because it's cute and cuddly. I also like the four sound options, the sound quality and volume is pretty good. My main complaint about this sound machine is that the maximum amount of time it can play is 40 minutes. When my baby would go down for a nap or sleep for the night, he would drift off to sleep to the white noise, but 40 minutes later the sudden silence would wake him every time. I have had success using it for short naps or when I am on the go, like in the stroller, and I have it handy so I can press the buttons to restart it once it shuts off. Maybe the sudden sound of silence wouldn't wake other babies though. That was just my experience. I got a plug in machine I use for night and long at home naps."
5,Great,This lamb is super cute. It has 4 settings and is so cute hanging on the crib. I wish it played longer it only has 23 & 45 minute options.
3,Okay but not great,"We only use the rain function since the others don't offer a real white noise our daughter needs. We ended up buying another white noise machine that was louder and stayed ON until you turned it off. Babies wake up from their startling reflex every so often, even when swaddled, so I wanted to have white noise playing throughout the night so she could put herself to sleep easier. Not so good for very particular or fussy babies."
1,Great on planets where nights last 45 minutes!,"This product is great for parents who would like their kids to sleep for up to 45 minutes, then wake up. Those of us who would like them to sleep a little longer wish that it wouldn't turn off after 45 minutes! I have no idea what they were thinking? Some kind of ridiculous liability issue?This makes the cute sheep useless. I'd recommend getting a cheap radio and setting it between AM stations."
1,Have to use a timer,"We bought this to take camping. Our 9 month old has a HomeMedics white noise machine in his room that we leave on overnight (love it). For camping we wanted a portable one. Our first camping trip, he'd wake up somewhere new and freak out (that led us to buy this product). We took this one on our second trip. This machine worked great. EXCEPT there is no way to use it without the timer! It shuts off after 45 minutes no matter what you do! He woke up about once/hour. If hadn't recycled the packaging already, we'd be returning this. Very dissatisfied."
2,White noise app on my phone is 500 times better,"The idea is great, soft, cuddly sheep that makes sound. Really wish this had continuous play. This works great in calming my son and putting him to sleep. He wakes up when it switches off after 45 minutes. I use the app on my phone a lot more. The app on my phone is $1.99, has over 30 sounds, and plays continuously."
4,The ocean sound is nice,"I like this product for the classic look--fits in nicely with our decor as it's unobtrusive. The sea sound is ultra soothing and it has a rotating knob volume control which I wish all toys had.The ""Tell Tale Heart"" sound is quite scary(Graco SweetPeace's heartbeat sound is more appropriate), and the whale noise is equally as disconcerting. So, we've opted for the ocean ambiance... The timer doesn't last for long, but overall, the sheep is a nice touch to our little one's nap/sleep transition. I left one star off as the ""nature sounds"" need a bit refinement."
3,He's cute But I was a bit disappointed.,I was sooo excited to get this I've had mommy bears (Womb sound bears) with my other children and LOVED this when I saw it here.. But I was quickly disappointed. 1ST off the sound box was VERY difficult to put inside so much so that as I was trying to get it in the velcro and top of the pouch ripped so i had to sew that up. Which ok wasn't tooo bad.. But what disappointed me the most was the heartbeat sound it is the WORST heartbeat sounds i have EVER heard My kids even made fun of it saying it sounds like a Dinosaur stomping around.. it DOES NOT sound like a heartbeat sound AT ALL.. So if that is a major plus for you DONT buy this.. The other sounds are p;retty cool and he's ADORABLE so that plus the difficulty of returning this we will be keeping it But Now I will HAVE to spend the extra money to get a different one with a BETTER sounding heartbeat/womb sound feature..
3,"Cute, but no heartbeat","This is a cute, fluffy little attachable toy for a child's crib, but the first sound that we all listened for, was the ""heartbeat,"" which we were all familiar with from other ""sleep machines."" This poor little thing contains aheartbeat sound that sounds more like warfare, or a jack-hammer going off in the street. This was very disappointing, because quite un-usable for that sound (which we really wanted). However, the other sounds werepretty typical and gentle enough, and the ""whale"" sound was it's selling feature. It was very unique and gentle.Were it not for that, I would have returned the product because of the ""heartbeat"" sound."
2,Booooo sleep sheep!,"There is no way that whoever made sleep sheep is a mother. With no continuous play mode, as others have complained, you are begging for your child to wake up in 45 minutes at best when it's soothing sounds suddenly cease to be. It's cute and all but cute does not equal sleep. I got a free white noise app on my iphone instead. If cute is all you're after, then sleep sheep's for you."
2,difficult set up,"This tent is difficult to set up in ideal circumstances (my living room) and one succeeds 2/3 times. On the mountain it is extremely difficult to set up and nearly killed my partner and I on a February ascent of Long's Peak. One has to pull the poles through sleeves and they get caught up with one another, bunching and not coming together. Otherwise it's a great tent, especially the vestibule. It is bombproof and looks cool. I returned mine after hours of attempting to master the skill of consistently setting it up."
3,wrong info on amazon,"+ yes, it is a hardrive, and it behaves like one.- however, amazon's info was wrong in that it only has 2mb of buffer instead of 8 as advertised.- also, it doesn't boot my mac. iomega is especially incompetent trouble shooting this.- power connector could be in the back, not together with all the other i/o in front- now, do i get a heart attack and spend hours on the phone trying to exchange?no, but lesson definitely learntnext time i do what others did: buy an enclosure and a drive separately, at least you know what you get."
5,You played the game. You know you want this...,"...otherwise, why would you have come across this item?Exotic techno meshed with orchestral glory.Intriguing and exotic vocals.Beyond the BoundsVivid TransparencyALOIVIA (= Viola A.I.)Ardjet...actually there isn't really a track on this disc I don't like, except for the Beyond the Bounds remix.Sadly, you will not find the extended track played during the extra mission survival mode in the Phobos area (outer space)."
4,Other Reviewer Didn't Have/Listen to This Disc,"This is a 1964 live concert (not a compilation). Essential performance, mediocre sound quality (good for its day, but not high fidelity). Five star performance (w/ Hubert, Willie, Sunnyland Slim, etc.)."
2,A Little Dated,"I am a huge fan of Mr. Wallace. Growing up, he was my favorite kick boxer. Unfortunately, this book dates back to 1982, and I'm afraid it's showing its age. The stretching section consists of a good stretch routine, but there's not much explanation to go with the stretches. The kicking section primarily contains kicks that require the extreme flexibility for which Mr. Wallace is known. As a fan I enjoyed the book, but I did not get much new information that I could use."
1,Song not on CD,"To those of you interested in this CD in lieu of finding the ""songs with lyrics"" in the movie ICE AGE, got bad news for you. They are NOT here! I really do hate it when a soundtrack is put out for a movie and they don't include the best or features songs in the movie. Anyway, the song that pretty much everyone wants when Manny, Sid, Diego and the baby are together and walking towards Half Peak is called ""Send Me On My Way"" by Rusted Root. It is on their latest album ""When I Woke"". Put Rusted Root in the Amazon search engine and you should find it. Hope this helps those looking for this song."
3,Expectations run high...soundtrack is low,"I expectd the background music sure...but where are all the songs where there was singing? For instance when they set off on thier journey the "" I want to live my life"" song? Sure as hell is not on this CD. I would like to know where the hell it is. I'll be expecting it soon... :| If you are looking for ALL the music for this movie dont find it here. Only background music people...no singing parts from the movie.I gave it a three only because the music is well done and does fit the movie very well."
4,A pleasant listening experience,"This is one of those scores in which you have to be in the mood for this type of score. It is quirky, upbeat, and fun in most places, but contains those moments of trademark David Newman thematic beauty. Though not as spectacular as some of his other work, overall a very nice soundtrack. Warning: It is very short!"
4,Keepin Da Greens !,happed upon these guys by random coincidence.glad i did!fresh grooves got me moving all hours of the day.recommended for lovers of chill house.
4,Balenciaga,"Being a great admirer of Balenciaga's work, I really enjoyed seeing his creations drawn by Tom Tierney. The illustrations are lovely.Balenciaga was renowned for his sparing use of color (he used a lot of black), and Tom Tierney has changed a number of the designs from their original sombre colors into bright ones (eg the ""cabbage"" cape is drawn in red, but it was actually black, the 1949 pink gown was origainally a subdued chestnut brown, etc).I was also disappointed by the omission of details (like pockets, buttons, etc) in some illustrations, which are clearly visible in photos of the designs in books about Balenciaga."
4,Retail Package,"I got burned the last time I ordered memory. This order worked out.Arrived in good order, timely. I'd recommend looking for ""retail package"" anytime you're buying an item like this.I've only used SanDisk for memory in my Canon 30D and they've performed at or above expectations."
1,DOA,"Bought from Amazon, put into a new camera, card unusable and camera could not even format it with a CF CARD ERROR message. Replaced it with a Lexar card, which works.Obviously since it 100% does not work it earns 1 star. I feel comfortable rating a product that arrives dead for its poor quality just as I'd rate a long-lasting product for its high quality."
5,great speed,"get this card if your serious about shooting continuous or shooting video. many cards boast their extremly fast speeds but those are read speeds, this is probably the fastest card on the market as speeds posted are read and WRITE! also get this size, anything over 2gb you would want for video, but when shooting mainly pictures less is better incase you card is lost or corrupted. carry a few."
1,Lacks a complete answer key,"For the majority of the quizzes, there is no answer key. Only the ""major review sections"" have one. Because of this I felt discouraged and lost right from the start. This may not be the book to get if you are trying to learn the topic on your own.That is why I gave this workbook a low rating."
5,Racoon/neighborhood cat trap,"The trap works great,easy to set up,easy to use. The score after two weeks 5 cats,0 racoons."
4,Wrong animal,"If they can smell the bait, it catches dogs 100% of the time. But out of 4 raids, raccoons seem to avoid the trap panel entirely. They are gone now and did their damage, but next time I will place a board over the panel to expand the trap mechanism's surface area. It probably won't miss a single critter after that. A good and sturdy trap overall."
5,Teach yourself visually knitiing.,Best knitting book Very comprehensive. Step by step illustrations. Very easy to follow. Wouldn't be without it.Learned many new techniques and basically was able to teach myself by using this book. I wouldTeach Yourself VISUALLY Knitting and Crochetinghighly recommend for for all knitters
4,A Fine Compilation from a Solid Pop Band,"The sound quality is excellent; the disc is filled with their best tracks. If you like a power-pop sound, male lead vocalist and backing lady vocalists (who are very good), you'll like this.I only heard a few of these tracks, but decided to go for the collection because I wanted more than One Sided Story. Having both versions of I'm An Adult Now is a real plus.But my favorite song, No Safe Place, is not here, no big deal. I guess it did not have radio play, so is not considered a hit or single."
2,"Seen one episode, you've seen them all","If you haven't seen this series before, you'll love your first episode... pick one, it doesn't matter--they're all pretty much the same. The writing is sharp and the acting is top notch. Unfortunately each set of characters has one gag, and that wears thin by the third episode.The one consistently fresh thing is the narration (voiced by Tom Baker!). It's brilliant and shows just how talented these guys would be if they'd stop rehashing their material every 30 minutes."
3,Little Britian Season 1 paves the way for a great successful series,"The first season of Little Britian is somewhat boring. Although it does introduce all of the hilarious characters. Season 1 did make me laugh, but not as much as Seasons 2 and 3!"
4,"Great Show, a little vulgar at times.","This show is hilarious.I personally don't find it similar to typical British humor, that can be clever and witful.This is more direct, and a little vulgar at times."
1,DON'T GET THE KINDLE VERSION OF THIS BOOK!,"If you want this book please don't get the Kindle version.The illustrations are totally illegible.What a waste of my money.The text is excellent but since the text revolves around the photos, the book is therefore useless."
5,This movie is simply sublime poetry !,"The script involves us in the XV Century when the devil forces will fight hardly to imposse its will .But the crude analogy is subreptitiously suggested by Marcel Carne and Jacques Prevert to create one of the most outstanding and terrible metaphores ever made.Both lovers will maintain their decision till the end . And the crude and arresting images when they are turned to stone , it is easy for us to know which was the emmisare of the Satanic Majestic during the Nazi Occupation in France.A timeless movie and one of the most pyramidal French films in any age .If not for the Children of the Paradise , this would be the absolute masterpiece of Marcel Carne."
4,Good book for 2-5 yr olds who like trains,"I had rented this book from the library for my son and at 2 yrs old he loved it. After a couple of reads he could identify the different types of train cars, and parts of a train track. Now, at 3, he recites almost the whole book as we read it. Its good because the story builds on itself, and allows you to leave gaps for the child to fill in for you. He liked it so much i had to buy one of our own."
3,Missing Beginnings,"Please be warned that about 4 or 5 songs on disc 2 have the beginnings of the songs clipped. I have read other reviewers speak of this problem, but not on this compillation.Too bad, because the music is great. I might recomend that buyers look into another Amos Milburn collection."
4,Ashkenazy's vision of Beethoven's 5th and 7th symphonies,"Vladimir Ashkenazy's conservative view of Beethoven's 5th and 7th symphonies remains valid when fresh insights from Jonathan del Mar's edited scores are increasingly in vogue. While this fine coupling won't supplant classic recordings by Carlos Kleiber, and Leonard Bernstein with the Vienna Philharmonic, it is still one worth hearing. The Philharmonia Orchestra's level of playing is as fine as the Vienna Philharmonic's; both symphonies are played with much warmth as well as technical precision. Ashkenazy's tempi are slow, giving him time to wring out as much lyrical phrasing as he can from these scores. Alas his best Beethoven symphony recording with the Philharmonia Orchestra, that of the 6th symphony, isn't available here at Amazon.com. Yet you won't be disappointed with this coupling."
4,No problems,"Boy, these reeds can get expensive! This product seems to meet our needs for a starter oboist. I understand that the pros learn to whittle and shape their own. Thank goodness we can get them pre-made for now..."
4,Taking your fate in your own paws,"This is an inspiring tale of a motley crew of animals who, whisked away from an animal shelter in the dead of night, take their fate into their own paws (need I say it is told from their point of view?). Despite hardship and trauma, by working together most of them make it back to the shelter and some are eventually adopted into loving families."
5,Fantastic Value,"Like the other 300-series Yamaha recorders, the Alto provides fantastic quality for the price. It is durable, comfortable, and sounds surprisingly nice. It will meet the needs of most casual players."
2,Wong a Classic but Materials Not,"It's very interesting to see Ark Wong's forms. Even just seeing them is interesting and informative. His style is clearly southern chinese in origin. Simplicity rules over fancy maneuvers, which to my mind is a good thing. On the other hand, this is the second time I'm buying this material. The first DVD I owned (Volume I) was plagued by ""damaged sections"" that made much of the material unavailable on any of my DVD players or computer. Recently I bought volumes I and II and matters were better, but Vol II had a ""damaged section"" that prevented me seeing all of the three section staff. I think this indicates poor quality reproduction on the part of the manufacturer. To buy 3 DVD's and have two have problems is not a good percentage! Yamazato has put out very interesting historical footage, but may have a quality control problem..."
5,"a thoughtful, succinct resource","This book is an elegant overview of the vast and growing subject of green building. It's an excellent starting point for the architect, designer, and builder who is getting his or her feet wet in the field.Although publication of this book preceded the introduction of the National Association of Home Builders Guidelines for Green Building, it anticipates the organization and subject matter of NAHB's guidelines. (In fact, SBIC, the creator of this book, served on the stakeholder committee that helped produce the NAHB GBG.) It can therefore serve as a valuable companion to the builder who is using the NAHB GBG to build rated homes.The challenge of course will be to keep this book fresh and relevant, as the field of green building progresses at an accelerating rate. So I hope DOE will continue to fund the work of SBIC."
5,Nice water purifyer,"Excellent little apparatus for purifying water. Easy to use and comes with good directions.I bought this as a ""Just in Case"" device for someday in the future."
4,Easy to Assemble,"I just got this a few days ago and it was very easy to assemble. I filled it up with compost and it is already ""cooking"" at the perfect temperature for compost. Easy to turn the unit but I know that it will heavier so I'll have to wait and see if turning becomes more difficult. So far so good!"
2,Don't overfill,"I bought the Tumbleweed in late fall based on positive reviews. It accepts a lot of compost-able material, and I generate a lot through home brewing. Problem was, I filled it up nearly to the mid point over the course of the winter, spinning it several times a week, until one time last week when I spun it, the spin-on top/bottom broke and all the compost fell on the ground. So, now I have a busted Tumbleweed and I'm sure it's not compost-able in the landfill!"
2,get ready for a workout,"i have a SpinBin, which is a compost tumbler much like this one - and i don't recommend them like this (i much prefer the 'wheel' composter style). Get ready for a workout if you get a tumbler like this - the fuller it gets, the harder it is to flip... in addition, put on some dirty clothes every single time you get ready to do it, as the nastiest spooge (also known as ""compost tea"") will happily fly out the vents and all over you. also, ours cracked right by the seam - and we don't even flip it all that often because it's so, so, so difficult to do. we were better off with a giant hole in the ground, using a shovel to turn the pile manually. the only reason this is any better is that it's good for those who can't have a hole in the ground or need to save space. if you need to get a composter that tumbles, get the wheel-style composter instead with a compartment in the bottom that collects that lovely ""tea"" - nasty as it may be, it's the nectar of life for your plants."
4,Addicted Reader,I think it was a great story. I think the story had a great message and it kept my interest and I wanted to know what was going to happen and the end really threw me because I didn't expect the outcome and it was really good. I can't wait to read more books from Malynda H. K
4,not as loud as a chain saw but ok,it works good the vibrator is great but the alarm is not as loud as i thought it would be. it is louder then most but not as loud as a chain saw
4,Enjoyable,"Sad Johnny Maestro is gone but this cd was pure entertainment to watch with the family.The vocals and band were all excellent on this and original members from Crests & Brooklyn Bridge together and the strength of Johnny's vocals is a testament to so many great singers out of the 50's/60's and the music we had then that had REAL meaning and true artistic depth nothing like the garbage put out today that disappears in a week or so from peoples' minds.This cd and music and all of the music from that period STILL lives on after all these years for one reason- it was great music and the performers then were ONLY about ""making the best meaning in a song"" instead of today's mentality ""how much money can we make""."
4,"Shawn Patrick Williams, Author of ""Warring With The Word""",Good foundational teaching. Needs to take it to the next level.
4,"Nice Item, Good Price","This mousepad is exactly what I needed. It is comfortable to use and my new cordless mouse tracks on it effortlessly. Love the color, too! Can't go wrong with this mousepad, especially for the price. The only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is that for adults with smaller hands/wrists (like me), you might find that it takes a little while for your wrist to get used to the angle of being on the gel support pad. Other than that, it's a great item and I'm very satisfied with my purchase."
1,It's made out of cheap plastic and cheap glue.,"In fact, I would give this product a half a star if there was an option to do so.It's just I had all these expectations of it being cute and matching the mouse I got for Christmas, not so much.This mouse pad was cheaply made. The darker plastic on the top started peeling off after a cold night and has been doing so ever since. And the glue, which ever kind it is, doesn't work at all. By the way I have cats and cat hair gets stuck to the glue,it seems like that's the only thing the glue can hold.Don't buy it, I don't recommend this to anyone!"
1,Dissapointing that the CD data does not work.,"There are brief instructions at the back of the book on how install the CD data files. After simply copying the folders from the CD to the hard drive, as instructed, and then trying to open the project and rebuild it, as instructed, one finds that all of the files are read-only. It seems that Barrie wants people to by his book, but does not want them to be able to access the data on the CD, rendering the data files and therefore the book, useless."
1,DO NOT BUY ANY SELF PROPELLED HOOVER VACUUMS,"HOOVER HAS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THE BELTS STRETCHING OUT ON ALL THE SELF PROPELLED VACUUMS, BUT WIL DO NOTHING FOR CUSTOMERS STUCK WITH THEM! WE MUST REPLACE THE DRIVE AND PROPEL BELTS EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS. REDICULOUS POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE"
5,A definitve monograph,"Every great artist deserves a great biographer: Bacon had David Sylvester, Giocometti had Sylvester AND James Lord, and Lucien Freud has Robert Hughes. Hughes' generous text is richly detailed and captures the mood of Freud's heavily impastoed works with turns of phrase that become as important as the art. To see the change in Freud's technique and approach to the figure from his early works to his current larger than life theatrical style is jolting. Always commited to portraiture his paintings have grown from the tightly surfaced, tiny but well known head of his friend Francis Bacon, to his current full figures as viewed from bizarre vantage. His brush technique has become more coarse and in doing so he is creating figures that, while monumental, feel as thogh they pulsate on the canvas. Freud is one of the important painters of our time and this book justifies that position on every level. A scholarly - yet pulsatile - study of a modern genius."
2,"Well made,but difficult to close.","The strap did NOT use Velcro to close. It has a button type, which you must line up perfectly , before pressing, to snap it closed.This is fairly difficult to do when it's in your hand and almost impossible to do when it's on your belt."
2,Motorola Bluetooth Pouch w/Clip,"This was no one of my better purchases. The snap that holds the cover came loos a couple of times and the bluetooh fell out. We were lucky thet it was in the house and we were able to find it. If you buy this item, make sure you snap it good. Be very careful."
2,NOT A GREAT BAG,"Bought this bag because I wanted a bag on wheels and the price was reasonable and came with free shipping but I wouldn't buy it again. There is limited room for paperwork or any assessories and since the handle is on the back, you cannot put anything on the back. Since you put things in the front, the bag leans forward and falls. It was not designed thoroughly."
2,Hopes were high,I was so hoping that this would be a wonderful book but alas it did not come close. While the content is indeed comprehensive the printed words are so difficult to read that I returned it. The description does indeed say that some pages will be difficult to read due to some of them being copied from original papers however I must say that the majority of the book is VERY straining for the eyes. Suggest people interested in the history of Spokane stick with the Bomantes' books.
4,I enjoyed Nicole Ray's CD single.,"I enjoyed Nicole Ray's CD single a lot because the song,Make It Hot,is very energetic and it makes you want to dance or move.The song's lyrics are also a reason that I liked this song.The lyrics expressed what a woman who is being cheated on feels,and she expresses those feelings very well.I think Nicole Ray is an up and coming artist and if she keeps putting out songs like Make It Hot,she will be very successful."
2,incorrect description for product,"The product came, i opened the box and much to my dismay the product was not correct. the description amazon provides is wrong. it is a power steering pump seal kit and not a power steering hose."
5,A must read for parents!,It gives great ideas and advice for dealing with your children in a loving and accepting way while still leaving them with valuable life skills.
4,great with apple's new magic trackpad,"Not too hard, not too soft. Got it to use with Apple's new Magic Trackpad and it keeps your wrist at an optimal height that won't tire you out too quickly. Nice, well-priced product."
3,solid...maybe too,"I bought this to replace an old gel wrist rest I had (which had been a lifesaver). The old one was starting to crack & ooze gel.Arthritis has made it effectively impossible for me to use my computer for any period of time without one.The fellows pad is a good shape and very firm; perhaps too. It is not as comfortable as my old pad, and cost 3-4 times as much.I hope it softens over time, and lasts longer. It has to to justify the added cost."
5,Why Bother?WHy Not: A Hollywood Insider Shows You How,"We all want to entertain stylishly but don't always have the budget to accomplish this task. Or so I thought. After reading Laurin Syndey's book I realize that resourcefulness and creativity are all you need. She's given us a helpful map to chart out all the things we need to live life more graciously and stylishly. And unlike Martha Stewart, it's not so complicated...Thank you Laurin. What great tips and what a great way to approach life..."
4,London under a microscope,"Fascinating book by a gifted writer. Ackroyd digs into details with a depth that produces nuggets of information that can be quite surprising. It takes sticking with the author while he excavates the layers -- that can make the book a slow read -- but the detail pays off often enough to make the experience engaging. A recommend for readers who love non-fiction or history. If you need a lighter-hearted approach then Bill Bryson might be a good choice, thanks to his ever-present humor."
4,A Great Book For A Wonderful City!!!,"Having lived in England for three years and having visited this wonderful city on more then one occassion I found this to be a very nice book to have as a keepsake of my stay in England.London is a strange mix of modern and old and this book is a wonderful introduction to this amazing city. Mr. Ackroyd has managed to pen a book that will take you back to it's very beginning, and then slowly through narrative, and picture bring you up through her amazing history. London has see so much, and if you have never visited this historic city then you will want to after you have finished reading this book. This is a good book for either reading for pleasure or as a reference book. This book covers all manner of historical details that pertain to this city. Mr Ackroyd address the issues of art, society, architecture, and political issues. Truly is this an all encompassing book that will make a great addition to anyone's personal library."

3,"Not for you if you just want to know ""what is this?""","This book is really geared more toward the academic. I would not find it useful as a field guide, though it makes for fairly interesting biological reading. It is not laid out in a ""field guide"" fashion, with species listed and illustrations for each provided. It would be frustrating to take the kids to the beach at low tide and attempt to use this unless you are very well acquainted with your marine taxonomy. Most species are not identified by a common name, and the color plates and illustrations are not necessarily near the species text.This book reads as a textbook for students rather than a useful tool for laymen who just need to know what critter they just found under a rock, and want the information before the tide comes back in."
3,Too many B&W photos,"Visited the pacific ocean recently and was blown away by the tidal pools and the sea life. Wanted to learn more so ordered some books. For someone not that familiar with marine life, this book has way too many black and white photos. It does have some great color photos and info, but I wish the B&W had been color also. My son is now interested in marine biology, so I'll be looking for a better resource for him."
4,No More Callouses,I bought this because even with the cushioned wrist rest I was beginning to develop callouses on my wrists. Since I have been using the gel wrist rest at home and in the office the calloused area has disappeared. THANK GOODNESS!But I did notice recently that the gel protection coat is rippling in a 1-inch area and it never goes back to a smooth surface.
2,After Effects LEAST Wanted,"If you are thinking about buying this book DON'T! I am an avid AE user, to date I own around 11 AE books and this one has disappointed me the most! I was psyched to get this book and anticipated it's arrival. As soon as I got it there was trouble. The most disappointing thing about software books is when the ... CD's content doesnt work or is non-existent. Granted some of the missing files are on the web site, but that is a pain to find and some of the extensions are messed up on sequence files. I am sure that the authors are talented and I know that FriendsofED puts out some good stuff I own many titles from this publisher that I enjoy. The only advice I have is fire your editors because they stink, how about you actually do the tutorials before printing the CD so you can catch the mistakes before people buy the books!"
1,[bad],"...It represents a new fashion in book publishing, where one author approaches a series of artists to share one of their projects and how they did it... The publishers love it because these books are so easy to do. The authors love it because no one person has to do the work. The result is a badly thought out, mish-mash of techniques and one total worthless book.Too bad Amazon.com does not have a way to give ""0"" stars or even a minus category, like ""I give this book -5 stars for failing on the most basic of criteria."" These people should be drummed out of the profession for such rank amateur..."
1,The foam literally stinks - get the gel kind instead,"Don't bother with these. The foam is very firm... much less comfortable than the gel style of wrist rests. Also, the foam outgasses terribly... there's a strong rubber tire smell from 5-6 feet away. As you sit and use this wrist rest, it's strong enough to actually make your eyes water. I'm not usually sensitive to stuff like this, but these are just too unpleasant. You get what you pay for.... What's really sad is that I ordered three of them and each was shipped from a different fulfillment site, each in its own gigantic box... what a waste!"
3,Good but watch out for errors,This is good book to use as a review and to take practice tests but there are errors. I have found several. It usually pertains to the letter given as the correct anwser; Example page 35 #2. There are others like this so watch very closely when grading your test.
3,A bit disappointing--glad I didn't pay full price!,"Buying test books can really add up--so I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this, especially considering what you get! There are lots of errors especially in the self-grading section, and from a big expensive company like Kaplan, I expect a LOT more. The tests are also not that hard and I've heard from other people that Kaplan's practice tests aren't as hard as the real MAT--they felt underprepared. The good thing is it does have a pretty good study guide section and has a bunch of practice tests!I also bought Barron's version, and was much more impressed--the tests were harder and it doesn't seem to have the many errors that Kaplan's has."
3,Good for C/C++ programmers just starting Ada 95.,"Ada 95 for C and C++ Programmers does a good job in showing the ""mapping"" from C/C++ to Ada. The short examples throughout the book give side by side comparisons of the language constructs. However, the examples need to be viewed somewhat skeptically. There are numerous errors (syntax, logic, comments) in the examples. There are also places where the text and the examples diverge, e.g., the text discusses functions but the example show procedures. If you are an experienced C/C++ programmer and are just starting Ada 95, this book would be helpful. However, if you've been using Ada 95 for a while, you will have already picked up most of the mapping that this book shows."
4,Absolutely delicious.,"I typically hate instant oatmeal. I often slave over steel-cut varieties, because all of the instant stuff seems to be mushy and lacking in texture and taste.This is the exception. The oatmeal is thick and has a great texture, and it is chock-full of delicious, real cranberries.The only thing is there are over 300 calories per cup! I don't think that the ingredients of the oatmeal are to blame; it's because the portion it makes is pretty big! However, if you are not counting calories or if you need a filling breakfast, you'll love this."
4,Chewy With Super Flavors,"Very tasty and nutritious, especially if left to thicken after adding boiling water or soy milk. Just the right amount of cranberries in it. No guilt because it's got 0 fat but lots of good stuff."
5,Love Pravana!,"Started using Pravana back in 2005 and love their products. Their shampoos and conditioners are excellent and their Keratin Fusion product, which I also use, are exceptional. They smell great and they work!"
4,I Add it to Cereal,"I use this product because I am mostly vegan and avoid soy and dairy. I don't even think about comparing it to the soy or whey protein powders. I do use it in smoothies, as several reviewers have mentioned.I don't think anyone has mentioned using it in cereal. Warning: I have been doing this for a long time and am used to it. I suppose it is possible that you won't like it at first!I keep a small water-tight empty container available. I put in a heaping tablespoon of the powder and some nondairy milk into the container, close it, and shake it. The powder dissolves, leaving a small amount of concentrated chalky liquid. I put this liquid into my cereal (hot or cold cereal), usually along with lots of fruit and nuts and berries. Then I add more milk. In moments of weakness, I sometimes add stevia (I like Truvia) or a small amount of agave syrup or honey.IMHO, this is a good way to add 12+ grams of protein to a vegan diet."
3,Bait & Switch,"What I got, is not what I ordered. Look at the above picture of the 1050 trap. I shows a full plate over the trap at the handle. That is the main reason why I purchased it. Racoons are notarious for using their claws like hands to grab at you when trapped. Especially when you pick up the trap, even with heavy gloves on.Also the trap is just too heavy to pick up witha full grown boar coon in it. Living alone and not having a man around the house, it was pretty heavy. Should have gotten the next size down.Amazon, should correct the picture of the trap, as it is not what I got."
1,"sharpen your axe, Simon","Another colossal disappointment. Readers and seekers of factual evidence have a difficult time discovering reliable science, which this book does not represent. A scientist or researcher cannot have an agenda other than developing a fair postulate from sound facts. Good research includes all that is known first, and then confining tests to rigorous and sound analysis. Southerton does not do this, as so many pseudo scientists do. This kind of researching falls in the same category as Erich Von Daniken's ""research.""It's a real pity that people of any faith will cast their beliefs to the wind without first establishing the validity of an author's premise and examination methodology. They are however, of like minds, who look for an excuse to rationalize the abandonment of beliefs over a seemingly unsolvable conflict of ideas."
2,could not even finish this book,"I too was interested to read this book after hearing it was a first novel by a new writer that won the Booker Prize. I really had high hopes. But try as I may, I simply cannot get through it. I will agree with other comments here that the humor is forced, and not too funny. A lot of it is based on cruel slams about women past their prime, snide remarks about country folks. Don't know if it was meant to be cruel, but it comes off as mean-spirited, and does not seem to be coming strictly through the voice of the main character. I realize that Vernon is not meant to be Pollyanna or anything, but this is unrelentingly hard on everybody and everything.I could not maintain my interest in the plot. Sorry. I know it is difficult to write a book, but I think this needed editing. Hope the author finds some happiness with his prize money, and his next project finds a better editor. This is unlikely, since he did win a big prize for this mess. Go figure."
3,"It's Called ""Fiction"", People....","I find the responses to this novel, especially those from righteously indignant U.S. citizens, to be as ironic and uneven as the book itself. I was both intrigued and disturbed by this dark work. At times repetitive, at times arresting, it presents a voice as memorable as Holden Caulfield's. Admittedly, I enjoy black, biting satire, a genre not to everyone's taste. Even with its weaknesses, it is worth exploring. And to all of you who are offended by the negative, stereotypical portrayal of modern America, please note: the rest of the world is not as ignorant and anti-American as you believe. Some of us take this piece for what it is - FICTION."
3,Almost Great,"""Vernon God Little"" starts out like a house on fire - scathing and very funny, it seems like it's going to be a masterful satire.But then around two-thirds of the way through things begin to fall apart. Pat set pieces, trite coincidences and a disappointing ending spoil what had been an incredible read.Still, this is a worthwhile novel, but one suspects that it won the Booker Prize more for it's send up of current American life than for the lasting impression it will make."
2,wannabe,"vernon god little is a wannabe.....it tries to be like the catcher in the rye...confused kid, growing up, spewing expletives in every 3rd word....the book drags in every 2nd frame"
3,First 80% Great,"This book was really good for the first 80%, then kind of trips up as it stumbles into some sort of anti-Texas, anti-death penalty message. Reminds me of how ""The Tipping Point"" was very insightful & then degenerated into an anti-smoking diatribe. I'm all for books conveying life lessons and universal truths but am disappointed when they become less universal and more political. Would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good yarn and appreciates humor, but you might want to look elsewhere if you don't like being preached to."
3,"Funny ""Ha Ha""?","I liked the book, very readable - killed a long overseas flight. I have to admit, though, that I was disappointed which is most likely due to the expectations that are part and parcel of being a Booker Prize Winner. The book is obviously meant to be a satire, but c'mon... Americans are fat, Texans like guns, tabloid journalism is out of control. Not exactly breaking a lot of new ground here, and I never found myself laughing out loud (unlike Confederancy of Dunces, for example). I think the book is most interesting in the context of being held in such esteem by overseas critics."
5,A lot to listen to,"Patti Page's voice has darkened and thickened so don't expect the sound you heard on the hit records. What you get instead is a vastly more interesting singer tackling an impressive range of material with expertise and total commitment. Patti was known as the perfect technician but she's gone beyond that to become perfectly interesting. She once was a musically superb but polite vocalist who sang with heart but seldom dived below the surface of her songs. Now she has ripened into an interpreter of great intelligence, perception and depth, plus she's STILL musically superb. This album documents a hitmaker who became a true artist. It got the Grammy and justly so."
3,The good and the bad,"The product, packaging and delivery were excellent.The album content was not what I was expecting. Several selections were stellar, several were so-so and several just not good.Album is not a total loss. I probably should have purchased a ""Greatest Hits"" album of hers instead of this. She was an amazing singer."
4,"Looks great, works great","Initially, the plastic smell was disgusting. I mean, I felt like vomiting that entire day. However, once it went away, I was able to appreciate this spiffy mousepad. The wrist support is perfect and there's a lot of room for your mouse to move on. Furthermore, the blue color complements my black laptop. I'm not sure how long this ""gel"" mousepad will last, but it's made by a reputable company - Fellows."
5,"I like it, but...","I purchased this product very recently and am quite satisfied with the product. The gel pad is very nice and supports my wrist very well when I am using the mouse. The actual mouse pad is great too as the mouse glides across with ease. The only downside I have with the product is that the color is a slightly darker blue than what is shown in the picture. If you don't like blue, I think it is available in other colors too. No matter what color it is, I would recommend this product to anyone!"
5,classic,"This is a little different than Kraan's other albums. The second album, it is darker, blusier, and the songs more concise.""Mind Quake,"" for example, is a minor mid-tempo number. It has Kraan's usuall popping bass, but is more ommonus than anything else they put on record. It fetures an interesting ""found music"" section in the middle. ""Backs"" also has the same dreary tone.This is not to say the record is not a tour de forse. The playing is excelent, and all the selections are grade A, even the funk-blues track the band preforms, mid-album. With its wha-wha and deep grind, this could be part of a jam from Miles Davis' LivEvil.The tone is simply different than the athletic, upbeat fusion Kraan fans are used to. But this is some of their best work and is essential."
2,Humble Apologetics,"A fair read. Stackhouse raises some valid points aplogeticists should consider when engaging in debate, i.e. be respectful of the other's positions and beliefs. However, the book develops slowly, is somewhat tedious and over states it's theme while undervaluing apologetics, even ""dis-ing"" several prominent Christian apologeticists, as a faithful means for intelligently defending one's of faith in the face skeptical accusations.Though his 230 page theme is well taken, Humble Apologetics does little to hone one's knowledge or skill in defending the Christian faith... it missed the mark."
3,Lavender Bath & Shower Gel,"A nice shower gel, although the scent is very light (lighter than I'd like) and you have to use more than the usual amount to get decent suds in the shower or bath. I'll look for something more aromatheurapeutic next time."
3,"Great price, but scent changed more lemon like","I love the price and the fact that the gel suds well. It also has a slickness to it which always helps with avoiding cuts when shaving. I find it does not leave a residue on your skin. However, the scent was recently reformulated and does not smell truly lavender like it once did. I've gotten use to the almost heavily lemon like smell that cuts into the lavender scent (it has a hint of the Mr. Clean brand smell I grew up with - yikes). I do have a highly sensitive reaction to smells, so perhaps for many this isn't an issue. I am still using this gel due to the great price, and would have given it 5 stars if the scent was not changed."
3,Kraan - 'Let It Out' (Passport),"Originally released in 1975, as this was Krann's fifth effort. Personally, I didn't notice much difference here from any of their other CD reissues that I've heard. This lp did, however include new member keyboardist Ingo Bischot. Guess it's simply TOO jazzy / progressive for my taste. A couple of semi-notable tracks are ""Luftpost"", the title cut ""Let It Out"" and the electronic-like ""Die Maschine"". Does anyone know if this German band ever did reunite within the last few recent years? I kept hearing something about that."
4,Charlie Parker: Live with the Big Bands,"What you get here is 21 tracks of Bird fronting three different big bands.There are three with Stan Kenton, ten with Woody Herman and eight with JoeTimer. What you don't get much of are the big bands themselves, so if youwant some good to excellent Bird with big band backing, this is a goodone. If you really are into these bands, buy a different CD, especiallyif Bird is not your thing."
5,Perfection,"Just the right size, height, and firmness. Doesn't slide when pressed on. Wrist stays cool and comfortable ."
2,not what you think.,"when i purchased this item i thought that it'd bring me comfort in my long hours on the pc. i was worng.1, it is not as soft as you'd expect2, it gets in the way while playing games and using applications that require extensive mouse movementi gave this item 2 stars only because i liked the color of the thing. apart from that it has nothing else that i think you'll like."
1,Wrist Rest not so Restful,"This is a lovely feeling product and it seems as though it should make using a computer much more comfortable. I found my wrist hurt more when I use it, though I am not sure why. I offered it to my office mate who had the same response.Maybe it has to do with how it is used."
2,Beware Skin Allergy Sufferers,"Within a day of using this wrist rest, I developed a serious skin rash. It was most likely caused by the ingredients contained in the gel of the wrist pad. If it was not for the rash, I thought it was pretty comfortable to use. Instead, purchased a bean-bag type of wrist rest and have not looked back since."
4,From the perspective of a social worker,This book uses a very clear paradiagm to analyse the different kinds of messages we give our kids. It teaches a person to be aware of the effect of what we are saying. It also can enlighten a person to the way in which they speak to themselves and to foster positive self talk. I would highly recommend this book.
1,Definatly not Madonna,This is ok untill you hear what the clubs are playing. Get this untill you can get A D.J. friend to tape the out of print Ultamix Madonna Mix. I t was only made for Professional D.J.'s and it makes the Ultimate Beat Medley sound like an Osmond album. The Ultimix version is Madonna!
1,"Agree with ""Mistake"" review","I completely agree with the mistake review. Wen-Chung had not the right, or the talent to complete and/or revise any of Varese' pieces. This set is not, in any way, representative of Varese's vision and is solely about Wen-Chung riding Varese's coattails."
3,"Decent, But Not Perfect","As you can tell from this picture, this is a fairly attractive cabinet for storing CDs, DVDs or VHS tapes. The good points are the fact that this unit is fairly small and slim and has sliding doors so it will fit in a cramped space. The bad points are the fact that the doors are the only solid wood part of the entire cabinet; the rest is either particle board covered by veneer or, in the case of the back of the unit, plain old cardboard. The unit still manages to look nice, though. One big drawback if you're planning to use it only for DVDs is the fact that the 2 fixed shelves are in awkward places---you won't be able to space all 7 shelves out to fit DVDs. The best you can do is use 4 shelves for DVDs standing up and lie your DVDs flat on the other shelves. This unit would be perfect for holding CDs, though, as the spacing is just right."
2,sliding door media cabinet,"The product was delivered promptly. My husband built it in about 30 min.There were minor scratches & nicks and chips on the product that I was a little dissapointed in. Otherwise, I like the item & it fits & works well for me."
5,Can't live without it.,"Every day, in every way -- have to have it to keep on trudging. You might be able to stay sober without it, but why cheat yourself?"
5,Daily Inspirations,"This book is good for anyone who is struggling with addiction, be it food or alcohol.There is a Spiritual guide in this book and it hits where it counts, the heart!"
5,Twenty-Four Hours a Day,"I wouldn't want to start my day out without it. It is written for the alcoholic, but it is good for anyone who is recovering from addiction. The references to how the AA program works are always timely and a good way to focus on how you need to grow as you learn a new way to cope with life as you put down your addiction.Then they have a paragraph about how to keep connected to God through out your day. I don't know how they do it but they seemed to always have significance for the day I am about to begin. It only takes a couple minutes to read but the ideas stay with you. I have read it from the beginning and I am looking forward to starting it again in Jan."
5,30 Year Celebrant,"I am, personally, on my second copy of the ""Twenty-Four Hours a Day"" book and have been reading it daily for 30 years. The copy I just bought is for a friend who wants what I and some of the other ""old timers"" have. Great, inspirational book."
5,great book for beginners or experienced users,"It really helped refresh my memory on what I had learned during the couple years I had Linux classes, and this book aids me now in tutoring other students in Linux."
1,Isn't that good,"Renee Fleming just isn't that good, folks. I don't comprehend why so many are infatuated with her."
4,"scattered, but great","Larval has 7 or so members with the standard rock rhythm section plus saxaphones and a string section. They play dramatic, soundtrack-style instrumental progressive rock somewhere in between Godspeed You Black Emperor, Don Cabellero and The E Street Band. It's obviously the last comparison here that throws everything out of wack, and gives the band it's unpredictable nature. This album stands really strong on it's own, but gives one the feeling that this band his not yet reached it's full potential."
2,Not anti-static,"This is a nice brush and does a good job with smoothing the hair, getting out snarles, etc. Be sure you notice that this is not a styling brush, if that is the type you are looking for. The reason I gave the product only 2 stars is because when using the brush,I have a lot of static. The description of the brush made reference to an ""anti-static"" rubber pad, but the brush does create static."
3,Coco in the Country,Coco Chanel flees her hopelessly limited prospects at home for the country estate of a man she had briefly bedded. She finds life among the landed gentry boring. So do we.
5,is BSG ever coming to BLU RAY?,I see universal is finally putting season 4 or better said half of season 4 out on dvd--but before i plunk down my downward spiral economic limited edition cash for this set--does anyone know should i just hold out fot a blu ray edition--i am one of those idiots who buys a new edition dvd for something added--not to mention converting some of my library to BLU RAY--but times are tough and i am trying to be logical and wait for the set i want--so any BSG BLU RAY info anyone?--By the way season 4 AWESOME. Only negative thing i gotta say is they made us wait so long to finish it.
1,What a waste of time compared to what was.,"How does one take a sci-fi and turn it into a drama? Go find the originals and you will find that even the bad episodes are better than this waste of time that hollywood threw up. It is all talk no action and the message behind it all is look what we did to ourselves. Enough said, except thankfully it is going off the air. Do yourself a favor and revisit the old show, even the costumes were better."
1,Soap Opera Anyone,"Every since they left New Caprica, this series has gone into a tailspin. I had hoped that the 4th season would rescue the plot from the abyss it was sliding into. No such luck!I watched the first disk and fell asleep in the middle of the second. I've lost interest in even finishing it. I was hoping those four turning out to be Cylons was a red herring.Why is it that only the Law and Order franchise can stay true to what made it great to start with.I won't mention the marketing/packaging stuff. Enough others have beaten that horse dead."
1,Buyer Beware,"Beware, this is NOT Battlestar Galactica but some stupid pilot for a show I will never watch."
1,RIP OFF!!!,"RIP OFF!!! This set is only HALF of the 4th season. That was not made clear in the product discription. Also the confusion added by the hundreds of fanboys that reviewed this product here before it was even released because they used this review section as a fan blog, not as a review of the product for sale.RIP OFF! Wait till they package the whole 4th season together and discount the price just like they did with season 2."
4,Why isn't 4.0 available in Blu-ray?,Battlestar Galactica is awesome; a five star show. This isn't a review of the show it's a whine about the format of this release. I have season 1 in HD and had hope that the end of the format wars we'd now be getting season 4 completely in Blu-ray. I have 4.5 on order in Blu-ray but that option wasn't available for 4.0. (I don't have cable so this is how I watch the shows and I'm waiting for 4.5 to be released.)It still looks pretty great despite not being high def. The sound is pretty good as well.There's less of Ronald D. Moore's commentary sitting at home alone drinking scotch and smoking cigarettes and more of him discussing and commenting with the writers of the episodes. I don't know if that's good or bad. The commentaries with him and his wife were in some ways... magical :-)
5,The BEST show on tv hands down!,"Easily the best writing around, and an even more stellar performance. Yes its sad that it is ending. I wish Amazon wouldn't take so long to get the episodes up on Unbox though. Seems like it takes forever. A show that appeals to everyone!"
4,BSG - Season 4.0 Review,The first half of season 4 has been pretty good. After watching most of it I would purchase it again. I've enjoyed it.
4,"Not Bad,,,,","Not a bad collection of the song,,,,don't care for the "" club mix"",,,sounds a little generic but if you like the song you'll like the other mixes,,,,"
3,it was ok,"Well I bought this and i installed it. At first I could not find any Holiday Stuff but then i looked under decorations and i did. But now i dont know how to have the ACTUAL HOLIDAYS. Can somebody tell me how, please????"
2,Only worth it if on sale,"Like others said, this stuff pack is the Holiday pack from last year plus 20 more items. There are some lovely items but EA still doesn't seem to realize that they are shooting themselves in the foot by offering the stuff packs at $19.99. Lowering the price here to $14.99 is a bit better but not by much.The only reason why I bought this stuff pack was because Circuit City had it on sale for $9.99 between November 19-22. If I'd been paying attention over the summer I would have bought Family Fun & Glamour at Circuit City at those prices but I missed the sales. $10-12 I think is a fair price for the amount of stuff in the pack. If EA set the price to that I believe the stuff packs would literally fly off the shelves. Every time one of these new packs come out I will be keeping my eyes on the Circuit City sales flier in the paper and buy from them."
2,Stick to the studio recordings.......,"I feel a little out of place being the only one here (so far) to write anything negative, but I wasn't that impressed with this recording. I have 2 other cd's by Incendio, and love their music, but they honestly seemed out of their element here doing a live performance. Their studio work is much, much better, and more enjoyable to listen to."
5,We Don't Need Nashville and their cookie-cutout cowboys!,"I first heard ""clingin to you"" on KVET in Austin, Texas. The sound was ""refreshing"" in an old kind of way. I then bought the CD, well no wonder, Clay Blaker is involved. This CD was recorded in Floresville Texas, (where I own property), but It sounds so professional, congrats to Clay, Tommy, the late Doug Sahm, and of course Ed Burleson himself. I will definately be looking forward for a future release from Ed, but NO RUSH, this one is going to keep me going for a while. WARNING! This is ""real"" country music! You may be tempted to go out and buy a pick-up truck and/or boots!"
1,Yuck!,A rip-off. It only about 15 minutes long. Not even close to what the price dictates. This must have been done by a bored high schooler.
4,Works with a MAC too!,"Monitor arrived in only four days. Thank you Amazon for that.Everything I needed was in the box and my MAC found and installed this monitor in the time it took to turn my machine on! Open box, plug in monitor and power cord, turn on machine and wah lah! Ready to go. Did not even need the installation CD that was included. Did not need to order additional cords or adaptors.Why I gave this four instead of five stars: Scrolling thru the brightness/contrast/color/etc settings was the pits until I got the hang of it and it's still not ideal. The pic is nice once you get the settings adjusted, and you can even use the auto settings to reduce the minor headache of adjusting manually. This step could be improved but is not so bad that I wouldn't buy another monitor just like this for the price or recommend the monitor to ""friends and family.""Great price, great monitor, great delivery time. No dead pixels. Buy one!"
3,Mac owners beware,"I should have known. I figured it would be easier to buy a new monitor via amazon.com instead of the local computer store. Ha Ha. What they don't tell you per the sales description is Mac users need a special adapter, the likes of which is not at all clearly described, just 'an adapter,' so I guess I'll be going to the local computer store after all. Would it be that hard to state on the package: ""compatible with Macs with special-undescribed adapter, not provided."" ? Very disappointing."
4,CLH Monitor Review,Very clear monitor and priced reasonably. Easy set-up; did not require installation disc on my Dell Dimension.
5,Great prodcut,The paprikas I purchased were of excellent quality. Been using and experimenting with all the flavors. I like the traditional the best so far.
2,Clarification,"Contrary to the confusing title and photograph included with this product, all that you get if you buy this product is the mousepad with a built-in wrist-rest.The keyboard wrist-rest and the small stand-alone wrist-rest that are shown in the product photograph are not included. A more representative picture is the one used in the listing for the Fellowes blue gel mousepad.As for the product quality, it seems fine. However, the mouse surface (which is covered with normal plastic, not the ""gel"" material) is a little too smooth for my mousing tastes."
1,Repetitive,"While I accept it does portrait quite well the anguish of a boy discovering he is gay and of unrequited love, the prose is absolutely inmature, simplistic in a way that could be acceptable in dialogue(which arent any better) but not in a character that age that is writting. It cannot be excused as the flow of the boy`s conscience either.The repetitions of ideas, specially inconsequential ideas with the EXACTLY same words makes it tiresome. Also, there arent any hints for the reader to discover the ""someone"" before the main character does, which is un unforgivable flaw in a mistery novel. Especially considering all the rest of it is quite easy to predict.The descriptions are, for lack of a better word, corny. The main character starts acting all manly but later suddenly changes his attitude in rather unbeliable way for a boy that age.I would be way more forgiving if I hadnt payed for it."
2,High school creative writing 101,"While I won't say this book is terrible, I kept wondering if this was a high school creative writing class project. The plot is good. The characters are stick figures. The writing is really unimaginative and not very exciting either. As a quick read on the beach, it wasn't terrible, just not great. Could have been so much better."
2,Self-publishing at its most mediocre,"With the difficulties faced by writers getting their work published, many have turned to self-publishing, and Mark Roeder seems to be one of those authors. But the merits of getting a book published by even a small press is an editor, something Roeder sorely needs. Typos, run-on sentences and stilted grammer make this problematic.He also doesn't seem to have a grasp on wrestling, a sport that's much, much better covered in the utterly fantastic PINS, where the author describes that world much better. PINS is also a literary book, but ""Someone"" doesn't go very deep, and while covering a topic very popular - teen jocks - it just doesn't carry it off. The author would do well to spend a few bucks having a qualified editor go through his next manuscript before sending it off to IUniverse."
2,Not Impressed,"The lotion smells ok but I don't really want to use it...in fact I wish I could return it but I already opened it. When I tried it on my skin it doesn't feel comforting or make my skin feel better. I can't say it irritates my skin but it makes it feel sensitive. Some lotions that are not necessarily fragrance free but do well for me are Palmers Cocoa butter lotion, the Cocoa lotion at Bath and Body Works, and the Blue Spa body cream at Bath and Body works. I like the faint fragrance all of these lotions have and they don't irritate my sensitive skin or bother my allergy prone nose. If you are not fussy about lotions I guess it would be OK."
3,definetly not their best,"i love the bouncing souls but this album is not that great.it has some good tunes on it:joe lies(when he cries)i like your mom,deadbeats and a couple others but that's it.it's not like any of the other albums that followed at all.the best way i can describe it is that it sounds like the vandals,kinda.and what's up with the two cover songs?candy(i want candy-bow wow wow)and i know what boys like(the waitreses)they're both songs about boys!!!!and how the female singing the original either wants them or she's singing about a boys wanting to touch her!!one cover like this is funny but two..it makes me wonder what gender the bouncing souls like.not nearly as good as their other 3 albums."
4,Instant Results,"After the first time that I put this product on I could tell there was a slight difference in my skin tone. The smell isn't the greatest but it's not bad and it goes away, especially when you put lotion on afterwards. I would reccomend this for daily use."
3,Boring Ferri,"After you have seen Alicia Alonso, Makarova and Fracci is not very probable that Ferri will be able to impress you. She is too 'dead' in the first act, and too 'material' in the second. The dancing is five stars -the acting is three. Albretch should go back to ""La Scala"" dancing class before the next season. In a piece where the music means nothing by itself (Adam was not the brightest composer of his time), the choreography is the most important element. Well, here is boring -to say the least- in the first act (they even kept the peasants pas de deux!), but gets better in the second. The Myrtha is powerful and understands her character much better than the rest of the stars. I would recommend La Scala to hire Cuban Alicia Alonso to stage her version before she dies (she should be 180 by now but, still, is the living person who better knows this ballet): The dedicated army of willies deserves it. The sound and technical quality of the DVD is excellent."
2,"Did the job for a while, then broke","I owned these for a year or two, though I am not a big cook and used them only about once a week, on average. They were sharp enough but, like some other reviewers, I found them uncomfortable to use, especially for tougher foods or jobs involving a lot of cutting, such as chopping up several boneless chicken breasts (I have small hands).One day, the screw loosened up, and later the whole assembly came apart. It would seem to be an easy fix, but I have tried to get them back together and cannot. I am going to have to replace them. In my opinion, they should have lasted longer."
1,Poor Ergonomic design,"This was a huge disappointment. I had a problem with the handles. They are too big to use comfortably. In addition, while cutting something, the skin on your palm often gets caught when the handles snap together.Very poor ergonomic design!"
1,Cannot use,"I wanted to add a second pair of kitchen shears to my life as I use them for so much (my first pair is a Henckel's). What a disappointment! This is actually the first item I have returned to Amazon (and I've been ordering from them for years). The place to put your fingers in handle is so big that is was very uncomfortable to use and the blades seemed 'to go too far' (hope you know what I mean). Anyway, totally unusable to me."
3,OK shredder,"I've had this shredder for about 1 1/2 years now. It shreds ok, don't put more than 3 sheets in at 1 time. The cross shredding works, but seems to make the strips catch back into the roller at times. The unit will jam sometimes with 3 pages or less. For the price, I would look at other shredders in it's class before purchasing again."
5,The Best,"The Pravana Curl Enhancer is amazing. I have curly hair that tends to frizz. I have tried hundreds (seems like!) of products throughout the years, and this is the best, better (for me) than the Diva curl enhancer that is used by the pros for curly hair. The cost of the Pravana is high because I bought it online, and you must pay lots for the shipping. But it's worth it. You use just a tiny bit. It doesn't make your hair stiff, but enhances the curls. It's great!"
5,FROM BACK COVER,"ATLAN BESIEGEDIn her quest to save the fabled Atlan, young Cija and her handsome lover, Smahil, flee the clutches of Zerd, the evil half-serpent who has conquered half the world.But, too late, they find there is no escape from their enemy - Zerd's army covers the land from hill to valley; all beings are swept along or destroyed; all cities are laid open to the plunder of his warriors.Now Cija must do the impossible. She must thwart Zerd's ravenous scheme of conquest - and it is the gods decree that she must do it alone!"
1,Not Much of a Product,"UPDATE: Utterly useless. Still inconsistent in several tanks; deep blue, no blue pale blue. Look in the tank and it's a blue ooze. Do not waste your money as I did.Original: I bought the multi-pack and dropped them into my office and home toilet tanks - a total of 4. None works consistently. Sometimes it's a deep blue color, other times pale blue or in-between. Critically, after a couple of weeks use, the rings I scrubbed off prior to putting these in the tanks have returned as have the flush marks. I will not buy again and do not recommend at all."
2,Stopped using,"Compared to Clorox toilet tablet, I felt the Vanish tablet ""vanished"" rather quickly so I stopped using once I used up the packet.Clorox tablet I used gave chlorine smell did not add color or nice smell like Vanish but I thought each tablet I used seem to last longer.For people who are lazy (like me) and hate cleaning toilet (like me) using tablet is way to go to keep your toilet clean."
2,Too opinionated for credibility....,"Entertaining, but that's about it. The author comes across just as opinionated and full of bias and cliches as the very man she is trying to prove wrong... She keeps shifting focus from facts to personalities following - intentianlly or not - centuries old logic: ""if you can convince the audience that your opponent is a bad guy, you half won"". Sad, but people follow their emotions more than their reason on either side of any heated debate...And all commenting on Stone's movie... Aafter all, it's not a documentary but the work of art, why lash out at the artist for ""misrepresenting"" reality - leave some breathing space to creativity! Otherwise, we may as well claim that Tolstoy was an idiot and believed all those lies about Napoleon when creating War and Peace..."
1,Hal Roach - King of Irish Comedy,"Unfortunately, I have not received this purchase - which was one of three, this being the earlier purchase. The other purchases have arrived one two weeks ago.I shall wait a further week then contact the supplier."
2,"Cheap, legs don't screw in.","The size is about right, for a small monitor or tv, but, the legs just lay in, they don't screw in, so if you have to pick it up to move it, the legs fall out."
5,excellent work,no i don't agree with the other guys review. this cd was just one of the best iv'e heard especially la mour and eye to eye.these songs and their ol school beat just keep up and jamming a real 5 star.peace
3,It was ok but.....,"This album is supposed to be a freestlye cd but sounds no differant than Jennifer Lopez with a little more rap than ole. Its not very good, but the salsa sound keeps it going. Not worth your money, Peace"
3,Nice cover,"The smoker cover was nice and less expensive than some of the others. I rated it middle of the pack as it's a bit on the light side, but it is better than the MasterForge one that I bought."
5,Just what I needed,Product lacks the 'felt' lining stated but other than that it works perfectly. Cover fits well and is of good quality and of course with Amazon Prime the delivery time is exceptional
5,Perfect cover and protection,This is a great cover for this smoker...it's a heavy weight vinyl and fits perfectly. This a great way to keep your smoker looking new an out of the elements!
5,"GREAT GROUP, FROM A GREAT ERA!!!!!!!","Everytime i hear any 80's music i wonder what happened to the music industry these days. Back then everything was a breath of fresh air, and funny at times. Bananarama was the best Girl group of the 80's.I really wish they come back with a new album soon cause they are really talented."
4,Good,"This is a good disc from Love and Rockets, but not as good as their older efforts. I would go back further if you are looking for an introduction, but if you are already a fan, it is worth the purchase."
5,Great Book/Not the Sheet Music,"A fellow reviewer left a detailed description of the sheet music/vocal score/piano and guitar score for ""Hedwig"". This item is not that. It is merely the book of the stage play, and while it is a wonderful collector's piece DO NOT ORDER IT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SHEET MUSIC."
4,"Dragon Naturally Speaking 8 Standard, it actually works!","Installed easily, with good instructions. I was up and dictating in a few minutes after completing the short training segments. Accuracy is OK at first, but is getting better over time as the program ""learns"" your speech patterns. The one drawback is that this program uses some horsepower. My overall system (Intel 2.4ghz, 1 gig RAM) runs noticabley slower when Dragon is loaded up. Although not perfect, this version of Dragon Naturally Speaking is voice recognition that works, and I would recommend to anyone interested in this technology."
2,Skeptical User,"I think this product is highly overated and this claimof being 99% accurate is false.Once in while it can amaze you by typing a sentence with 100% accuracy , but this enthusiasm is quickly dashed whenyou realise that the very next sentence is completegibberish which bears absolutely no relation to what yousaid and you wonder how it could have possibly interpetedwhat you have in that manner.I think this program maybe accent sensitive so that a person with an American accent may get good results whilea person with a British or an Australian accent may get poor results for the same level of training.In summary I think the program is unreliable with anaccuracy of 45% at its present level of developement.It has plenty of potential and with future developementit could much more reliable but at its present level ofdevelopement I think the performance is mediocre."
4,Lost Gem,"Ultimate Domain (or Genesia in the European market) is another great strategy/simulation from Microids. For it's time, the graphis are pretty nice with good texture depth and animation. The sounds pull you into the atmosphere of the game, and the voice acting is pretty well done. Gameplay has a slight learning curve, but after a couple of hours, you tend to get the hang of it thanks to the intuity of the menu systems. For anyone who likes a challenge, the AI leaves a little to be desired, but I promise you that this is one of those lost gems that are overlooked and forgotten about. I remember playing this game on my 486, and unfortunately, this game has taken hours upon hours of my early life away from me. I was thrilled to find an original copy of this game as it is probably my all-time favorite of that era. Check it out. You won't be disappointed!"
2,Don't Bother,"This book is actually very, very low on content. To give you an idea of the amount of content, it took me 20 minutes to fully digest the book. Having gone through almost all of the belt tests covered, so much has been left out that the book is of little value in assisting the student in preparing for his or her belt tests. The actual standard for each kyu and dan rank is not even mentioned. The only notable feature of the book, other than its publishing quality, is the photography.Frankly, I expected more. Indeed, this book could have been so much more had its author decided to write a book rather than pose for photographs."
1,"Flimsy plastic, Terrible design","As the other reviewers stated, it's difficult for my 5 & 2-year-olds (& their Mommy) to figure out. Also, it's made of a very cheap, flimsy plastic -- which seems to be the norm for a lot of the Hot Wheels tracks, etc. Terrible truck with such great potential."
5,Simple and cost-saving solution,"My daughter's keyboard on her laptop was damaged. A local company provided us with a three-figure estimate for repair. For a total of some $38 including shipping, we fixed the computer ourselves within a week armed with nothing more than a screwdriver and the computer's manual. All works perfectly and I saved a chunk of change: What's not to like."
5,"Excellent CD, my favorite of many","This CD is meant to be used with the Mind Modulations Proteus Light & Sound Mind Machine. It drives the light from the unit, which produces changes in brain waves and helps balance the brain hemispheres. This particular CD is one of many I tried and for me induced the most pleasant and relaxing state. Most likely, everyone will get somewhat different results, so you may want to try a variety pack such asMind Modulations AudioStrobe Collection Volume 1,Mind Modulations AudioStrobe Collection Volume 2or for the best valueMind Modulations Deluxe AudioStrobe Collection.This particular CD has a great mixture of music, light and chanting. It induced a sense of relaxation and well-being in me more than any of the other CDs I've tried. If you get this one, I hope you enjoy it."
1,no more,"No taste; does not do anything for me. Expensiv. Hardly disolved: Was like grated nutmeg in the water. Will stick to the Matcha green Tea, which I love."
3,"Unusual, but pretty good","Not a masterpiece in science-fiction, such as from Asimov, Clarke, Heinlein, etc., but for what it was, it really wasn't bad. It's just a nice, fast read with lots of action."
5,UNDERWORLD meets BLADE meets THE MATRIX!!!,"That is the best way to describe this unique, highly-entertaining, fast-paced book. Not that it was trying to mimic or copy any of these great films, but it damn sure has what it takes, in my opinion at least, to one day become a hot summer blockbuster should the book's ""script-like"" test ever find its way into a screenplay. You've just gotta get a copy!"
2,"Short, sweet Christmas story, but not what I was hoping for.","The character Derek was introduced in the book Sarah's Child. He was interesting, intriguing, different and wonderful. I was eager to learn more about him and see him in action in this book, but I was disappointed. This story was about a Doctor falling in love at first sight. Derek was the doctor, but this book didn't go into anything special about him. The story was ok, but because I wanted more character development about Derek and didn't get it, I rated it lower. This is a short story, only 93 pages long. Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: one. Copyright: 1987. Genre: contemporary romance."
4,"Good selections, but the mix could be better.","It's a good overview of the group's history (although some of my favorites are missing (e.g. ""Good-bye Suzanne"")), but the re-mix balance is pretty bad. For some reason, the person doing the remixes decided that one channel of the masters didn't need to be as prominent as the rest. Unfortunately, in many songs, this channel had the women's voices...on these tracks, it sounds like the women are in the back of the studio with no mike (the balance is much better on the original vinyl). There are also a couple of tracks where important vocal lines are submerged under the rhythm ""section"". A good selection, but be prepared for less than optimal mixing."
5,Thumbs Up!,"If you are into corn, this is the flakes! Less than serious, more than a home movie. Webb Wilder is the last of the Boarding House men!"
2,A wonderful book for Ancient Greek/Roman mythology.,"I believe that this book is full of valuable information that can be used to understand Greek/Roman mythology. It has useful information and it is somewhat reliable. If you need information for a report, I advise for you to use another book for more thourough points."
1,Buy anything else. Skip this one. Please see the comments...,"This book was used as a text for a graduate class I took. The lecturer of my class was a student of Brettell's. I presume the relationship determined the choice of text, because this book is not a book to be chosen on merit. Editorial choices (including at least one image published upside down) do not help the author's lack of brilliance (to be kind). Buy anything else. Only if you have a 300-tome collection of books on modern art should you even consider this book--and then I know you'll want to use it to light your fireplace.My comments are seriously given to those folks who buy books for their personal libraries..."
5,this funky jazz that should not be overlooked,once again these guys pull of another tight album.this is a must for any collection.there are turntables on a few tracks that create a nice funky flow.this was my first mmw purchase and is a great introduction to a style of creative improv.
2,"A fair album, but not representative of MMW potential","MMW are some of the best bands producing music today. Shackman was an incredible album. However, they lost it here. The record scratching DJ is like grafiti on the abilities of MMW. A true disappointment. GO BUY SHACKMAN!!!--a truly awesome MMW album."
3,Pretty Good,this cd has some good moments with the Hooks&organs.interesting take on Sly&the family stones everyday people.but at times gets a bit heavy on Long extended Vamps.still it's a interesting disc.
5,Pure aggression NYHC style,"IF you Love Agnostic Front in the early years, this is a must have. To me the sound quality is the way hardcore should be. It loud, raw, and agressive. To me, that is Hardcore. If you like clean sounding, remastered garbage, than this is not for you, but if you like the real Hardcore, get this one."
3,Ti Amo's Best CD!,"Reviewer: Louie C is now Little Louie. This Cd by Ti Amo Records is its best yet. With Cliche's smash song ""Show me"", it is a must buy and a definite in any anybody's freestyle collection. Freestyle to its best! 2 thumbs up"
5,REAPING 3RD GENERATION SEEDS,"I read this book in two days, it was my grandmothers who has been in Heaven for 8 years. She was the only child of an only child who bore 6 children. I am the third generation of the ""seed faith"" she planted. She was single, poor and with no apparent hope. But she had so much faith. I am successful, have a wonderful family and because of her selfless act to start a family coming from just herself (and Jesus) we now have over 45 members of our family all stemming from the 6 seeds she planted!! A true miracle. I found this book in some of her old things my mother has, and it did not surprise me at all. My grandma. I am pioneering a mission from God to help people achieve financial independence through faith. The principals I have learned in this book that has crossed my path by no coincidence, and is no doubt a harvest of much cultivated soil a long time coming. Thank You Jesus!!!"
2,Todd Koontz is a con man and a liar,"I could write what Todd Koontz knows about finances and it would not fill the back of a postage stamp.Its called ""steal people money thru lies""That's his finance plan. What is yours?"
3,Classic Reading or Classic Movie,"After reading the book Jumanji, I first notice how different the book is compare to the movie. When I was younger I loved sitting on the couch and laugh at how entertaining the movie was. After reading this book, it seems a little boring, to be honest. The one thing I will admit is that the illustration and writing of Chris Van Allsburg is amazing. The art work is so unique compare to other children books, the illustration are all drawn in black and white. The writing does bring the story to life and excitement to the reader's imagination but in my opinion read the book first and then watches the movie, not the other way around."
1,Jumanji,"Although the reading level listed is for 4-8 year olds and the editorial review states the book is for 9-12 year olds, this is a PICTURE BOOK suitable for 4-5 year olds. All the reviews I read were about the movie. The story they're describing is MUCH more complex than the book. I bought the book for my 10 year old nephew, but will be stuck with it. It's simply inappropriately simple for most kids over 5 years of age. ..."
5,Awesome Author,This is a book you will read over and over. This author has a way of creating stories that will last in your heart forever. Both the story and pictures are wonderful. A must have for all family libraries.
4,A Game That Comes Alive!,"This should be the first book that you should get because it is probably the best way to describe a game that practically comes alive. It's impossible for animals to appear out of nowhere and for it to rain in the house, but this book is really good. I hope that you like it! -Sean, Nantucket, MA"
5,"Generous Seller, Wonderful experience",I wanted the Jumanji book to give as a gift and was thrilled to find it at this bookstore for a few dollars. They really just want to recycle books and it is most appreciated. Thank You for such a wonderful gift. I definately highly recommend this seller!
3,Fraudulent billing,"Excellent information contained in this publication.It is published by Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine Feline Health Center.Therefore I was recently appalled when their circulation director tried to rip me off for $24.My checking account records clearly showed that the balance had been paid several weeks prior to him pulling that stunt.When I catch somebody trying to steal from me I'm afraid we no longer have a working relationship, and I cancelled my subscription.Really a shame, because Catwatch posts a lot of information that guardians of cats need."
5,AWESOME MAGNUM OPUS,"One of the things I always critizised in regards of Neoclassical music was that playing was always on top of composition. Well, not in this case. Michael has managed to composed a passionate work of epic proportions.Uli Roth meets Malmsteen? maybe, however, fasten your seat belts for an unforgettable ride full of surprises."
5,Bawls is Great,"I purchased this because I realized I was going to 7-11 almost every night to get Bawls. It's a better deal on amazon (obviously). The only bad thing is that because you have a huge stock of Bawls, you end up drinking it all the time because it's so delicious, even when you don't need the energy boost."
5,The best marine/coral/invert book ever!!!,"I am simply amazed at the depth, clarity and insight this book provides. Do not be thrown off by the lack of information on corals and fish. Everything else immaginable is covered. From refugiums to plankton , this is in depth , easy to read sound advice. The authors have two more books in the series that are in the works on fish & corals. This first book is a monster and an excellent reference for those of us who hunger for knowledge in this area. It is packed with in formation, photos and humor!Do not wait to get this book. Get it now!"
4,Fine biographical sleuthing,"This is an extraordinary example of biographical sleuthing by the fine English stylist Hugh Trevor-Roper (1914-2003), Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford. Edmund Backhouse (1873-1944) was supposedly a gifted Sinologist, long resident in China; but under Trevor-Roper's steady gaze, he is revealed as a pathological deceiver and pornographer who, despite gentlemanly manners and extraordinary persuasiveness, was in the words of the DNB, ""litigious, profligate, and a gross snob."" Remarkably, as Trevor-Roper notes, Backhouse seems to have been ""almost magically protected from all the effects of his own actions....sailing calmly through the stormiest seas"" while ""his successive victims sank spluttering in his wake."" (292-93) Any prospective reader needs to ask himself whether he is prepared to devote the necessary time to learning more about such a charlatan, even when the exposition comes from the elegant hand of Trevor-Roper."
3,Speaking As A Business,"The book is more about how to run the business of speaking for a living than about motivating your audience. The title and editorial review are extremely misleading. If you are the verge of making good money from speaking I recommend this book. If you are a cold person and you need help faking it till you make it this book may help. If you need to be reminded that being in business for your self, you are the only one that cares about the fine, but important details this book will help. Right now I am looking for books that help improve the first few dozen speeches. This is not one of the books I would recommend but I did read it from cover to cover. Who knows somebody might pay me to speak. If so I would re-read this book."
2,Zire owners need a good grip or duct tape.,"Bought it for a Zire71. Both the charger and Hotsynch cable do connect electrically and will do the jobs they are intended to do, but they will not remain on the device. They pop right off the PDA; you have to hold them in the slot with both hands to make them work. In a pinch, I could use them to perform an emergency synch. But holding the charging cable on for long enough to get a meaningful charge is impractical."
5,"very good selectionof cheeses,my friends will be getting these for the holidys","definately one of the best out there,no need to waste time looking any further,this is the one you are looking for,even has a nice wicker hopot pad for the table"
4,"It is a Big Deal when the Poles ""invade"" Chicago!","Although the movie is in Polish, with English subtitles which are occasionally misspelled or mistranslated, it is very funny. It is an excellent subtle satire on communism as seen through Polish eyes, disguised as the misgivings of the intrepid heroes concerning capitalism and race relations as they journey to visit an expatriate in the big city of Chicago.Very funny and interesting scenes back home in their village and aboard a cruise ship as they venture to America. A dissertation on the evils of capitalism as pronounced by the official communist line while aboard an airliner headed to Chicago was priceless!Some (relatively) shocking scenes of racial prejudice by one of the travelers belay the official all men are equal communist view, as racism exists even in communist countries, if only unofficially. Not to worry, his prejudices are thoroughly trashed by movie's end. Very funny in the interim, however!"
3,Is Dana Ewell REALLY guilty?? Think!,This was a good book if you read it from the detectives point of view but it is very one-sided. After reading this book I am not convinced that Dana is guilty of this horrible crime. It appears to me that the detectives were hell bent on getting a conviction on Dana at all costs and this book is merely a pat on the back to the detectives. There are too many unanswered questions. Too many people benefited from the deaths of the Ewell family not just Dana and some are benefiting now that Dana is in prison and the inheretance money has been redistributed. Are we 100% sure that Dana is guilty and should be locked up for the rest of his life? I for one am not.
1,detectives were vain not thorough,"The book lacked authenticity from start to finish. Important facts that contradicted the story were simply ignored and left out. The detectives involved come off as totally vain and angry, envious people, looking to find a high profile case like the Billionaire Boys Club or Menendez brothers murder cases. What these detectives were looking for was their own personal glory. How sick is that."
1,naive people like me beware!,"This book is a very good book. When I read it, I thought it was the best one I had read on Buddhism and I decided to take a 10 days course. The experience was challenging but the big disappointment came afterwards when I applied for a second course and was told that hypnotherapists were prohibited by Goenka to take more than one course. I would have to give up my profession as well as my Zen meditation practice to carry on. In other words, there is a big discrepancy between what is written here and what is really practiced. I now think that this Vipassana group is just a cult around the person of Goenka, his prejudices and his hypnotic chanting, which has in fact little relevance to the teaching of the Buddha. Real Vipassana meditation described in the sutra is not hypnotic at all and much more complicated than the all body sweeping meditation, with eyes closed in a dark room which is presented as the only authentic practice."
2,disappointing,"I found this book to be content-poor. There are better introductions to Buddhism, and certainly better books for the inexperienced practitioner. It is possible that if I was a student in Goenka's lineage, I would have gotten more out of this book."
5,"""Those Were the Times"" is the best melody","Miguel Reyes album ""Those were the Times"" is one of the best freestyle albums around, each song has a clean and refreshing beat,. I'm waiting for his next release,."
2,PLASTIC FLAG FASTENER,"ON THE POSITIVE SIDE; IT HOLDS THE FLAG AND DOES NOT MAKE A SPOT ON THE FLAG POLE WHEN BANGING IN THE WIND. CORRISION DOES NOT GET ON THE FLAG AS SOFT METAL FASTENERS DO. THE NEGATIVE SIDE; THE PLASTIC FASTENER LOOSES THESHAPE AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE FLAG AFTER AROUND THREE MONTHS IN THE SUN. THE FASTENERS ARE STILL WORKING BUT THEFLAG CAME OFF ONE TIME IN THE WIND. WHEN THE SHAPE CHANGES, THEY DO NOT CLOSE WITH A GOOD FIT. LARRY"
4,the Shamen take house to a new level,"Though UV is not the Shamen's best work to date, it is still a great display of what works in electronic music. The entire album keeps the listener energized and feeling good. UV is not as dynamic an album as Boss Drum, but sets a good tone with a steady future-house feel. You will not go wrong with this CD."
2,I must be the only one!!!,"Let me start off by saying that this book was extremely well written BUT I hated the hero, Max. He left the heroine when she was pregnant with his child, got angry with her because she wouldn't have an abortion, angry with her when she wouldn't give her son up for adoption, fell in love with and married another woman, had a child with her and then after his wife died decided maybe the woman he'd dropped might look pretty good after all. He let everyone in their hometown call their son a bastard, never once in 18 years admitting to being his father(although since they both lived in another city he did have a relationship with his son and did pay child support) So, after all that he pretty much expected Kate, the heroine to be grateful that he decided it was ""the right time"" for them to be together. Personally, if I was Kate, I'd have jumped on Nicholas(the good looking boss)and told Max to hit the road."
5,Worth twice the money!,Easy and fast! One click makes the perfect cookie. Easy to clean and just an all around great product! Sorry they didn't make one like this years ago. Now I can throw away all the old ones that don't work!
1,Hard to use,"I got this cookie press for 8 bucks at Michaels. I thought, ""Hey, that's a great price!"" Now I know why it was 8 bucks. It's worth 8 bucks.Wrestled with the thing to get some hobo looking cookies one time. Then the second time I used it, it wouldn't push the dough out at all. The dough I used is not a stiff dough either. I had a very hard time getting the press to click. One click is supposed to equal one cookie. I gave up because my hand actually hurt after squeezing the trigger so much and trying to get the thing to click. Hopefully I can still return it..."
1,"Very picky, then it broke",Mine was very picky about the amount of flour in the dough - had to be just right for the cookies to come out properly. Today the barrel broke clean in two just below the top threads while I was squeezing out the 5th cookie of the batch. I only got about 4 batches of cookies out of the thing. Guess $10 doesn't buy much these days. :o(
2,Not a happy Christmas camper here,"I did not even get through the 1st batch of cookies. plastic broke .. disappointed, shopping for a new one Not a Wilton,Christmas will go on .. No I did not over tighten.. it just kinda of froze up on me and I was unable to open the tube up, hope Santa likes what I baked... oh I bought this item at the store but its the same model.."
2,Breaks Easily,"I bought this cookie press to make Christmas cookies. By the time I was finished with the first batch, the coupler in which the disk is placed had split. So, with each squeeze of the trigger a little dough would come out the side as well. I would use this press again if I needed to, but am currently searching for a good one. This one is just cheaply made."
1,Broke after 2 uses. Poor Quality.,"Love the recipe that came with the cookie press, however I only used this product 2 times to make spritz and the plastic collar ring cracked and broke. Good idea, poor quality. Would not buy again."
2,Sentimental and unenlightening,"Excerpts from Chris Marker's footage of T. directing the filming of the Sacrifice is the main reason to watch this. As an ""elegy"" I find this unsuccessful: moody shots of various holy Tarkovsky sites in winter, uninhabited, while music swells. Almost no intentions here at all beyond display of ""feeling"" about Tarkovskys tragic life that comes off as pretentious. That the director be treated as a self-evident saint is what its about. A wonderful documentary to seek out instead would beAndrei Tarkovsky's: Voyage in Timeshot in Italy around the making of Nostalghia; that one I would watch over and over."
5,Timeless,All the songs on this CD is great with great freestyle artist that will always be remembered.
3,Intriguing back ex-stories thrust to the fore,"The simplistic art will no doubt throw most people off. The art is not the sell here. It is the collection of brief, mostly one-line descriptions given the author by real people about former relationships. Taken in context, the book is an engaging - albeit quick - read. You wonder about what the exes of someone you've met might be like. This book takes that wonder a step further and treats the reader to a buffet of possibilities.Probably too short for many, but a nice jaunt through a prickly subject."
2,Broke after 1st night of use.,"We purchased this pepper/salt grinder and were happy with the feel and simplicity of it, but upon the first night of use, it broke! There is a plastic ring, just near the pepper grinder (ceramic) area. This plastic ring snapped apart the first night. So, we are returning it (very happy with the return policy and process of Amazon!) and will be purchasing a Vic Firth wooden model pepper grinder and salt grinder set. Ours may have been a fluke, that's why I am reviewing it as 2 stars. Also, I'm not sure if this is TRULY a Vic Firth grinder. It is produced by a company called ""Fresco"", but I am thinking that the ceramic grinder components are from Vic Firth. We will be buying a Vic Firth grinder directly from Vic Firth on our next order."
4,Very Nice Salt & Pepper Mill!,"I looked high and low for a salt & pepper mill that I liked the look of, and wanted to pay for. So many of the nice looking ones are very expensive. This mill is sleek and unobtrusive on the dinner table. It doesn't put out a lot of salt/pepper at a time, but that's ok with me. The grind size adjustment is very fine, so if you want to change it drastically, feel free to turn the knob a full 360. My only complaint is that it ""leaks"" a little onto the table."
5,Exactly as expected,"Easy to use. Looks great. Just as described. On the expensive side, but I love it."
4,Excellent,Tony Coe is an amazing jazz musician as well as playing classical. This is a great CD and his improvising has to be heard. Clarinet is his main instrument but he is a virtuoso on tenor as well. His cds are hard to come by outside of the UK and this is a superb example of his playing. I would have rated it five stars but did not feel that the accompanying trio live up to expectations. Otherwise it is a must have.
1,2 different sets and still don't work right,"The first set had a mismatched wiring harness for the LED's. It looked as if Pilot made an upgrade on splicing the LED wires down to one connection but the harness still had two connections for the LED's. Exhanged them for another set, the wiring was correct on these but I only get one LED color out of the 7. On both sets the HID's worked well and nice and bright but the LED's are unreliable. I'm thinking Pilot is using this as a marketing ploy to sell regular fog lights but they need to come up with something that works as advertised. I spent days splicing wires to get the first pair to work, finally gave up and exchanged them. It only took 30 minutes to remove the old pair and redo since I knew how to do it from the first time around and still disappointment rules the day with these things."
4,Juicy Juice,"This is a very good juicer, but you will need lots of fruits and veggies to get the juice, There will be lots of pulp going to waste if only use for juicing. Cleanup was OK but there is still a few parts that needs to be detached and wash. Over all it's a very good juicer."
1,Defective,"This item worked great for a couple of weeks and then on and off after that, by the end of the third week, it was off. Great product, if it would of worked."
3,wasn't what I thought - juicer worked fine,"Even thought I read the reviews, I wasn't prepared for that much pulp waste. I felt it should be used (other than baking or cooking it). I returned the juicer, which worked fine, but it's not for me. I prefer a vegetable & fruit smoothie that uses all the food."
2,Unimpressed,"This juicer leaks and often sprays out juice when used. This isn't from over-stuffing or shoving food down, either. Basic, proper use makes a mess, and it has a very hard time with even the smallest pieces of carrots and beats. The blade basket is supposed to be dishwasher safe, but the dishwasher never gets it clean. It has to be hand scrubbed with the brush, and the other parts half fill the dishwasher on their own, they are so large and numerous. We are completely unimpressed with both the quality and the performance of this machine."
2,better late...,"This product arrived a little late, and then the seller failed to include the manual and the software CD. I wss able to download both with quite a bit of effort. I'd say this seller failed to deliver as promised."
1,Worst. Album. Ever.,"Waste of money here. SCOTS usually had some good stuff, but this album is terrible. It's like a bunch of zombies wandered into a music studio and started trying to play. I'd send it back but I threw it away."
2,one good tune,"Being a big fan of both Halloween and SCOTS, I was hoping for more from this disc. Its probably worth purchasing only for the song ""Bloodsucker"", which is a great tune. The rest of the tracks don't have much to reccommend them though."
3,off-gassing,"I'm very happy with the size, shape, and firmness of this wrist rest. The off-gassing from this thing however is possibly a deal killer. Seriously its so bad that it makes my eyes burn, which can't be a good harbinger. I'm going to leave it outside for a week and see if the smell goes away. If not it's unusable."
1,"Horrible chemical smell, gets dirty too easily","This wrist pad has a really bad caustic chemical smell and I cannot recommend it at all. Also, after only a week of using it, it looks grungy and dirty where my wrists have rested on it. Poor product all the way around."
2,Rating!,"This movie, though R rated is sold only ay PG-13 level. Warning some scenes might be edited or deleted entirely."
3,The trick for the hiccups really works.,"If you don't know what I'm referring to, watch the film.The In-Crowd is a throwaway thriller that is entertaining for 90 minutes. It's a mixture of Basic Instinct and Wild Things, but not as good as either. It may be a B-list thriller, but it's a movie I enjoy watching over and over.Definitely one of my favorite guilty pleasures."
1,Bizarre attempt at suspense fails miserably,"Like the equally terrible film ""the skulls"" this is another in a long series of teen movies that try to be sexy like ""cruel intentions"" but merely come off laughable and cheesy.The film plays out like a soap opera, full of pregnant looks, beautiful clothes and bodies, but little substance. The ""in crowd"" itself is composed of really underdeveloped characters, and not an African American in sight.Brittany Foster is just not that compelling, nor are her rich and shallow friends. The body count is really low, and your interest level will follow suit quickly."
3,"Decent, but too much war","I liked the premise of this series, but hope the rest of the books are more upbeat (especially since I already bought them). This one dwelled so strongly on the Jacobite uprising, and how it tore apart families and friends that I was depressed by it. Then, to my surprise, the author's note talked about how she tried to keep the war out of the story, because it was a romance. Believe me, there is a lot of ""war"" here. Call me shallow, but I don't want every other page of a romance novel to be filled with the conflicting ""causes"" of the characters, and the attendant misery. Ugh. But if you factor that out, the magic elements were, well... magic!"
3,Good Summer/early fall bag,"Bought this for DS for scouts. It's light, has a pocket in the front inside which is big enough for everything he wants to keep close, and zippers function well. He did state that two nights back in September he was camping and was freezing cold both nights. They were in the foothills, but the temp stayed above freezing both nights."
4,"Not their best, but way better than any other show like it",They are as ridiculous as ever (in a good way) and now they have equally ridiculous budgets. I think their money cuts into the magic a little but it is still well worth your money.Their is in fact no 'missing' 7th episode. It is actually the Christmas special and will be included in series 18. (The Christmas specials are always included in the even numbered series)
1,Gary Puckett can't sing anymore,I was really looking forward to getting this DVD but the singing is so different to the original with the Union Gap. Gary needs to give up or at least try to sing the same tune as on the CD or even take up singing lessons!
3,Awrrrrr ....,"Heck, I hate to be the one to deviate from the prior reviews, but I just did not hear what I expected from a performer I really enjoyed in the past. The ""original"" Gary Puckett, from the Union Gap days, had a great/strong/clear voice. The older Gary has changed his style of singing, and does not ... speaking just for myself ... match what we heard in the Sixties. He mentions, in one of many very good short interviews between songs, that, while Chicago is still enjoying great success, his own career has ""gone in a different direction"" (i.e.: singing at the Holiday Inn). He is obviously a fine gentleman, as deduced from the interviews, but I don't believe I'll watch this DVD again."
4,Retro cool !!!,Nice set for the price. Just what I was looking for. Assembly was pretty easy if your handy with a screwdriver or an hex head allan wrench. Would recommend to others.
5,Good sleep every time,"I've been taking this for several weeks and every night I sleep restful. Life extension is one of the better brands. 3 mg is plenty for getting a good night sleep. As we age our bodies don't produce melatonin as much and we need a little help,"
1,Dangerous!,"I ordered an Apple power supply last August 2008 through Amazon.com from Brilliant Store. Without my prior knowledge, they sent me a Chinese knockoff 'Replacement AC Adapter Model no. A1184.' My daughter has been using this supply with her MacBook. Tonight, the power supply melted down, literally, and became a very hot wad of white plastic. Needless to say, it doesn't work. I am very disappointed in this supply. It is dangerous to use. The title of the supply clearly states ""Apple MagSafe 60W power adapter."" This is not an Apple supply. This supply had the same current rating as the original supply. Avoid this supply and avoid future fires. Buy ONLY genuine Apple adapters for these computers!"
3,Does the job,"The cable insulation is delicate and wears out at the magnetic end making it unusable at the least, and a serious safety hazard at the worst. As if that wasn't enough, the adapter is too pricey for frequent replacement, and there is no way to replace just the damaged cable.That being said, I found it OK to purchase one from third party sellers. I was hesitant at first because of the low price, but after recently ordering one from ""smart_parts_usa"", I think it is a good deal. The item comes without the extension cable, but if you are replacing an older adapter, you probably still have the extension cable anyway."
1,Bad product. Didn't last long,Purchased this charger and after 1-2 months it stopped working. Avoid this product. It says it is an Apple original but it is not.
1,We never received Item and Shipper Doesn't Care!,"We ordered this item and never received it - we complained about it with the supplier, but they said it was our problem. The next one we will not buy from them."
1,Stopped working after 5 months,Great product while it works however stopped charging after 5 months use. I definitely would not recommend this laptop charger!
1,Terrible,I bought and 1 month later it dies. the magnetic thingy does not last and comes out too easily. This is my 2nd power adaptor. What is wrong with Mac adaptors? A good way for apple and its subsidiary to make money.
4,Superior design at cost,My Macbook is 7 months old. It's well traveled. My six year old misuses it. And I've never had any problems.I thought I might get an extra one for the office. I'd never pay 70+ dollars for it if I didn't have to. Value:Cost ratio certainly knocks off a star.
4,Great replacement,"Very good item, bought it to replace my original, works great received it very timely"
1,DID NOT WORK!!!!,"I am very disappointed with this power adapter. It did not work at all. Upon further inspection, the magnetic power connector does not line up with the computer, and is not making full contact with the computer. You can tell someone pieced this together on their own, and is then reselling cheap aftermarket parts. DO NOT BUY THIS. Spend the extra $20 or $30, and buy a power cord straight from Apple, or from a trusted seller. I let the good price of this tempt me, and I ended up having to buy a new power cord anyway."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM.,"Original Apple 60W Power Adapter (T-shaped Connector) for MacBook fell apart after three days of use. I tried to unplug it, andit just fell to pieces in my hand. I am aware of the fact that Apple has not good power cords. It's an issue I have discussed with them.Once my third cord went on my Macbook, I turned to Amazon to get a new one ASAP, and as always, it came promptly and worked great.After three days it was in pieces. I do not recommend this product. I am frustrated as to what to do about a power cord, because I am tired ofpaying top dollar for bad cords.. but save yourself the annoyance, and do not buy."
1,Stopped working in LESS THEN TWO months!,"BoughtOriginal Apple 60W Power Adapter (T-shaped Connector) for MacBook with AC Extension Wall Cordin May from KC Trade / Wegener Media which is probably the same seller and it stopped working in June. Unfortunately, return window has expired and product has no warranty.Probably, KC Trade / Wegener Media and others, who offer genuine chargers for significantly less then MSRP, are selling refurbished items, since mine stopped working in less then two months!!! Will never buy this product again.Based on reviews,electricking Ultra-small 60W 16.5V 3.65A Laptop AC Adapter/Power Supply Charger/Power Cord for Apple A1181 A1184 A1278 A1330 MacBooke Pro 13 13.3-inch, Fits Apple MA538LL/A MA538LL/B 661-4269 661-4485 661-3957 (White)seems to be a better product. Just bought it and will post my review in a few months."
1,not good at all,one of the pins inside went down and it did not work.....within a month after i got it! Not worth it. Just go to the apple store and pay full price....this is easier than going to the post office to send this back to amazon:(
1,piece of junk,"it didn't show any sign of working. I debated if I should buy it here, because of the reviews, but since I have a balance on my traid-in account I decided to give it a try. well now I have to pay for shipping this junk back :((("
2,Worked for about 6 months,"I purchased this in Dec 2011 and it worked great. around June 2012 I noticed it wasn't charging sometimes. Now, I have to jiggle the end until it lines up with connections just right. I will not purchase this again."
4,Good,"Exactly what you would want for a replacement charger. It is an actual apple charger, not one of the knock offs. They add some features to it, like extending the plastic part that actualy goes into the MacBook which can be a touch annoying. But as far as quality and everything else go it has been perfect so far. These guys are deffeniatly the ones o buy a charger from!"
2,Charger no longer works,"I purchased the refurbished charger hoping to save money only to find that it is now costing even more than if I would have purchased a brand new one. First of all, it wasn't delivered with the promised AC Extension Wall Cord. Since I had another, I didn't complain, but I am writing this review because I only purchased the charger a few months ago and it's already broken. I'm very disappointed. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Works,I just got this as a replacement and it works well. It hasn't failed me so that's good. The plug in easily detaches though. It wasn't as easy to detach with my other charger but I bought this one used so that's not really a surprise. I don't have a problem with it other than that and I've been using it the past three months.
2,Great idea poorly executed,"Another voice with the same experience: I use my Mac with care, no special handling, and the cord frayed and got very hot just at that juncture with the magnetic head. AppleCare took care of the situation, and within 48 hours I had a new one (although they shipped only the central element, and not the plug nor the long cord that attaches to the outlet). That's okay with me because I have those parts from the original. But the inconvenience of even losing just one work day is very frustrating, because that's what happened, at a time when I couldnt' afford to be idle.I wish someone would invent a competing product of the same kind, with magnetic attachment, because that is a great idea. When your dog sidles up to you and sits on the cord, it's good that the cord will simply detach. (And no, I don't believe that activity is enough to account for the fraying and loss at the magnet head.)Poorly done, Apple!"
1,turd,"I've had 3 or 4 of these things. The first one to fail was due to the very short strain relief. The wire burned up just like so many on the internet. I wasn't tough on it, but you'll have to take my word for it. Heck, the cord has only been unplugged from its outlet maybe a dozen times. I never roll it up and jam it in a bag, but it failed anyway.The replacement, and all adapters since have been the newer ""T"" sytle connector with the slightly bigger strain relief. These have all experienced the ""broken springs"" problem. I'm headed to the apple store to buy *another* one of these things (for my 2006 macbook) tomorrow. I hope the ""macbook air"" style magsafe works better than the old ones did."
1,Lasted only 2 months,"I don't know what the problem with this is but the product only lasted a little over a month. I only had until October 15, 2012 to return and it went out 3 days later...don't waste your money on this product."
2,Don't Buy This Fake Chinese Charger,"The charger worked for two months and suddenly stopped working. I took it apart and you could tell it was not a genuine Apple product, the build quality was terrible! I'm uploading a picture of it.From the day I got it, I thought the charger might be fake, as it is extremely easy to accidentally pry open.The price this charger costs is not worth its usable life. Pay $20/30 more for a real Macbook charger, so that you don't have to buy a new charger again in 2 months like I did."
3,Old T shaped better than the new flat,"Whatever you do, buy the old T shaped cord for the Apple rather than the flat against the computer adapter. And then buy immediately a Mac Magsaver that you screw on it. The other cord frays almost immediately and doesn't seem to have nearly the staying power that the T shaped one does. And once you put the Magsaver on, you have a cord that can go on and on. I wouldn't have believed it except that I have been through countless of the flat cords with my MacBook but still have the original T shaped. Terrified that I would need another, I bought this one and put it away. But, as my husband runs through his flat cords, he uses it and thank goodness it continues on. If you are in a foreign country where there are not apple stores, safe is better than sorry!"
4,Better than buying from the Apple Store,The power adapter is just what I expected. It's a solid piece of equipment that is capable in doing its job. It's like anything I'd buy at an Apple Store only for less money.
4,"One of my cat's favorites, but does shed","This was my kitten's favorite toy until I got her a squeaking bird. She loves the feathers on the ends of this, and she has managed to get some of them off (it's obvious it won't last forever0. The fur part does shed. It shed a lot at first; so much so I wondered if it would last. But it's a month later, and I haven't noticed any fuzzies on the carpet in a while. My kitten actually prefers to play with it on her own, rather than have me hold it and tease her. She drags it all over the place, including taking it out of her box when I DARE to put it away."
5,Great boat improvements,This is a book of suggested improvements to make sailing and passage making easier and more efficient.
1,does not work,Have not been able to get cam to work other thatn with very bad jerk movements. Do not buy!!!
2,Works OK if you can get it installed.,I attempted to install this camera on five different computers with two operating systems (Windows 2000P & XP-P)over a period of several months. After many fits & starts I succeeded with only two. Once installed it works no better or worse than a number of other models. Tech support is not very helpful & the online support forum succeeds mainly in letting you know that other users are having the same problems. Bottom line is that the installation is just too much trouble. I cannot recommend this one.
4,Liked it well for the price,"The camera came across pretty clear. Easy setup. The picture is a bit jerky, but I only paid about $35 including shipping. Best value for the money. The reason I bought it is that it got a great review online.For the money I'm pretty happy with it."
1,Extremely low quality equipment,"Extremely low quality equipment. It is so bad quality what you are not able to enjoy using it. Save your karma, do not buy low-end products like Logitech."
4,Can't Complain,Works great. I work for the College of Education at the University of Idaho and this is all we use. Great product for a great price.
3,So-so camera,Pros:The quality of the picture is good (not excellent) even in dim light.Cons:The in-build microphone is really bad. It gives too much noise.The software (drivers) that is shipped with the camera is awful. I spent a lot of time installing it and it crashes my system (Windows XP)
1,"Decent hardware, horrible software","This camera has reasonable hardware, shows good resolution and decent colors even in bad light conditions.However, the software that comes with it is horrible. Can you imagine 85MB download for a simple web cam driver? Which then unpacks temporary installation files to your Program Files directory (120MB more) and never deletes these temporary files (the actual driver and software takes ~60Mb more)? That takes half an hour to install (longer than it took to install Vista on same box - the whole operating system)? That installs TWO services and adds TWO programs to your Run list, slowing your 3GHz Pentium to the speed of 386 processor? And finally stops working after several days and requires reinstall?It could be a nice camera if Logitech provided simple and reliable drivers. But they did not, and it really makes a difference (in a bad way). I'll likely throw this trash away."
1,HP-XP SP2 crashes,"I fell for the look and price of this device and deeply regret having bought it. Every now and then my laptop (HP Pavilion running on Windows XP-SP2) crashes with the blue screen staring at me (among many reasons, the blue screen comes up when your computer lands in some sort of a memory exception possibly due to malfunctioning of a device driver). I tried re-installing the software, and by re-installing drivers offered on Logitech's website but nothing works. It is stated on their website that HP & Logitech know this problem and are working on it!!! Hope it helps prospective buyers."
5,Very Excited,"I recieved this as a gift, and it works wonderfully! Pretty good speed on Comcast internet (faster than dsl), CLEAR pic...and easy install!"
4,Pretty good webcam,"Very good picture during daytime/good light, but not so good picture during night/low light."
4,Perfect for grandma,"I purchased this model based on the features and the reviews. It installed great, and my mom can watch her new grandchild daily through Yahoo Messanger. I get a great picture. I've also tried the recording feature, which works just fine for me.The only thing I wish it did better was a bit more flexibility on the angling of the camera. I have to prop it up on something in order to get it angled down correctly. The base is somewhat limited in the amount of tilt available."
3,Dissatisfied,"Eventhough the picture quality is rather high, i did not enjoy the microphone of the device. The noise makes me crazy! I cannot use it for video conversations."
5,Great image and voice quality,This samll web cam is doing a great job connecting my families overseas. The flexible shoe is really handy and the image and voice quality is beyond my expectation.
4,Arthouse Groupie,"I happen to be one of those who loves art house films so it was entertaining to me. If you like Quentin Tarrantino and Michael Winterbottom's work, you will love this movie. It is not mainstream and obviously very low budget. The cinematography was crappy and the production was very low budget by appearance but, the movie survives due to the story. It has a great cast of beautiful actresses and very erotic scenes. I saw actress/model Georgianna Robertson in a film called ""Ready to wear"" directed by the late Robert Altman and thought she did okay but, she was very good in this film. The actor portraying the role of ""Stanley"" (Emanuelle Edili) has potential to be a great actor someday. The character of ""Darnell"" is the most entertaining but, I was turned off by this guy's balding hairstyle and bad make up. Someone should have cut dude's hair or shaved it for the film! It was just ugly. This is the first of 9 episodes and it has peaked my interest enough to buy the other 8 DVD's."
4,Just what I wanted,"I rated this stereo with 4 stars because it was exactly what I needed for my 24 foot Bayliner 2452. I mounted the remote at the helm station and it has a full menu necessary to control all functions. I mounted the main unit in the cabin over the table. The main unit has pig tails which I use to connect my DVD player and mp3 device. The mp3 play back on DVD's is limited and will not playback a full DVD. It does however playback mp3 DVD's with less recorded space. The sound quality is fine and powers my 4, 5"" speakers with ease."
1,False advertising,Made in China ... not USA as advertised. Peppercorns are NOT included as they advertise.I returned this product back promptly ... don't buy!
3,Great price.....looks great....sub-par design,"The Good1. Looks great2. CheapThe Bad1. Bad design and bad instructions2. A couple crews missing2. Hard to assemble/dismantle and very time consumingI've had the Atlantic storage rack for about 6 months now and haven't run into any problems despite the missing screw. It's a sturdy piece of furniture on a hard surface floor (wouldn't recommend it on carpeted floors). If you're looking for a cheap DVD/CD rack that's not at all bad looking, and wouldn't mind the time needed to assemble, then this is the storage rack for you."
3,Not what I expected,"The magazine sounded like the perfect one for someone new to Florida. However, it isn't any different than other magazines like travel magazines. Nowadays they are full of ads and not much substance."
5,A Beautiful Little Book,"A wonderful yet small collection of reproductions of Manet's last works. A very great artist, at the end of his days, paints exquisite small works of flowers. What else could you want?"
3,Fellowes Neato Matte CD/DVD Labels review,Product is cheaper quality than it used to be. It is harder to put labels on CDs than it used to be.
3,Un-natural sounds,"I'm looking for an alarm clock that 1)I can read without my contacts, 2)has a snooze alarm, and 3)doesn't have a loud, jarring alarm. I thought, after listening to several in the store, that this was the one; wrong! I set it for ""ocean,"" and was awakened by a seagull screaming and tsunami waves crashing. My cat leaped off the bed, and I later discovered that the alarm had -- literally -- scared the ____ out of her! Needless to say, I'm returning the alarm; that's a little too much ""nature"" for me!"
2,False advertisement,Bought this bag have been using it homeless for about a month and a half. It is comfortable with thermal underwear around 50 degrees F. At about 30 degrees F I was shivering in this bag with thermal underwear and TWO sleeping bag liners that were supposed to add 14 degrees EACH to the bag. Needless to say the temperature ratings on these things are absolutely ridiculous. I would probably not use this bag alone in weather under 40 degrees. Complete trash.
4,Great 3 season bag even for 20% more,"For the price (and I paid 20% more than the current price), it's the most durable, warmest, lightest, smallest bag I've found. I've used it many times below freezing (down to 25F) without getting cold. Others say this is not really a 15F bag - well you have to add 10F to any bag (as per European ratings). It's much lighter than compariable bags (such as those recommended in other reviews). It comes with a compression bag (which others don't) - but it is somewhat of a chore to get it packed. It does compress down suitable for backpacking (unlike department store bags). Finally, it's well made. Now, there are lighter/smaller and warmer bags (I own one), but of course they cost more. You can't go wrong for $90 bucks - highly recommended. UPDATE: Straps rotted and fell apart ... unlike other older bags stored similarly - so I removed a star."
3,hard character to like,"This character is almost like the hard-boiled detectives I like, but a lot less romantic. Those guys always have a soft spot for somebody. Alix doesn't seem to have a passion for anything or anyone in her life, except detecting. I get the Nordic repression aspect, but I wanted a catharsis to come much sooner than it did. It's hard to care about a woman who doesn't even visit her horse very often."
4,Lise McClendon's Plots Are Great,The Alix Thorssen mysteries are always intriguing and surprising...a must for a good mystery story. The setting is interesting especially if you've ever been to Jackson Hole.
3,Can't get enough of KC,"Not a bad product the first CD is great. The 2nd cd is the new stuff that i am not familiar with. RED is their best album. I just wish the song -Neal , jack & me was on this cd."
5,Joyce Chen Scissors,"I have always liked the Joyce Chen scissors, This is a welcome addition to my collection."
4,"Nice, wish the velcro was ""stickier""","These work great to increase my workout burn. I walk on an incline on the treadmill and I can feel the increased difficulty with these on. It cuts my workout time, which is nice when you have a family and toddlers and every minute seems occupied with chores. I also use and just walking around the house with them on while doing errands works good to tone my legs. The only drawback is that the velcro straps could be thicker and ""stickier"" -- sometimes they fall off if I don't strap them tight."
2,Not worth it,"These weights are very comfortable, but that's about all they have going for them. The material the weights are made from is very thin and tears very easy. My weights lasted about 2 weeks before one of them started to leak sand. You'd be much better off buying a set of more expensive, adjustable weights as the time these last just makes them not worth the purchase."
1,How to ruin a great product,"I have been an AMazon customer forever and likewise, have had every version of PaperPort since the olden days. PaperPort has gone to hell in a hand basket. Once it was a great product; I had all my documents, receipts, even pictures scanned into it. Since about v. 8.0, the company has abandoned its thousands of loyal fans, and that has only gotten worse over v. 9.0 and 10.0. It's quite simply impossible to get int ouch with a human, and now my PP is running so slow, out of the blue, that I'm looking for another product. (In the past, I always got an upgrade, looking for a fix. No more.)"
5,"Well-written, concise, easy-to-understand","I'm glad I took a chance on this book...it was well worth it! The author's clear, concise writing style is accessible to novices, yet provides a knowledgeable overview of data modeling. The book navigates you through the finer points of the process, deconstructing the design steps in easy-to-understand language. Highly recommended!"
5,Enlightning,What I like about this book is that it is a great reference book for the architect/modeler. It is very concise and to the point. That is what makes it great.
4,Excellent but the nose foot print is a bit too big,"The tool is very good. So far I fired about 2500 nails without a problem. My only criticism is the size of the nose bumper that prevents a close side (toe) nailing. In that regard I should have bought the Hitachi for the same price in Amazon which has a smaller nose and permits a closer toe nailing. I hope Milkwaukee reads that comment and provides a smaller replacement for the nose bumper of that otherwise excellent gun.I own five different guns made by the company (big framing, 18 gage, 16 gage, roofing and the 15 gage) and I am delighted by the reliability of these tools."
1,The Royle Family - Series 3,Not received DVD as 01/28/2011 .......... ordered on the 12/26/2010Looking forward to watching it !!!!!
4,"2-pack costs slightly more, but shipping is free","The 2-pack is currently $1.84 more than buying 2 cartridges separately, but free shipping is offered only on the 2-pack.I am satisfied with the ink quality, but the cartridge seems to run out quickly, hence the 4 out of 5 stars."
1,Convergence - for the birds,"I too am a big fan of Joseph Cornell, and this sort of new book, A Convergence of Birds, is one that I was eager to read. The first short story, Emory Bear Hands' Birds, by Barry Lopez is powerful and worthy of being placed in this anthology. But the rest of the collection, pa-tooey. Even the Joyce Carol Oates contribution is suspiciously unworthy of publication. The rest of the pieces, both the poetry and short stories, are simply stream of consciousness junk writing that should never have found publication anywhere, least of all, in this beautiful-looking tribute to Cornell. Perhaps there are writer snobs ""out there"" who claim to understand this stuff, but once again I'm afraid the emperor is wandering around looking for his underwear."
3,Used sold as New!,"I just received this in a sealed plastic package thinking it was brand new. However, after cutting the packaging open, somehow this utility knifelooked definitely used, with scratches, dirt and sticky residue all over it like somebody used it even though the blade is new. Did not use it yet, but I expected a brand new knife."
4,Great book to learn about Eucharistic devotion,"This book is an intense and detailed look into Eucharistic Adoration. I knew nothing about this topic before I read thisbook. It is not a super easy read--I really had to concentrate. It gave a lot of history and information.. I think it would be great for a theology student or someone interested in this catholic tradition. It is very well written, detailed and complete."
5,Great book for beginners and advanced woodworkers,"The author does a great job of describing in detail just about every aspect of woodworking, from cutting to glueing to sharpening to finishing. There is a lot to cover and he does it very succinctly and with enough detail and various methods that the reader is given a LOT of ideas on how to go about any given project.The hardcover is a beautiful book. Even if the content wasn't as good as it is, it is still a beautiful book to look at."
5,"Great Pictures, Good Articles, Right Worldview","My son loves this magazine (and so do his friends to whom we have gifted it). The pictures are beautiful, the articles inform him and make him think, and we don't have to deconstruct the worldview like we do with other magazines. If you're looking for evolutionary just-so stories, there are other magazines out there."
1,Misleading,This should be labeled better on the cover and in descriptions! When I want my grandchildren to learn about God I'll take them to church and teach them by example. This is a religious magazine based on creationism and not on scientific knowledge or fact. I am Christian with an avid science interest. God gave us a brain to think and learn!!!
2,"Decent, but sub par","I am a fan of the Noir anime series, so I was really looking forward to finally picking up the OST. The first disc was good, but the second disc left me disappointed.It's not bad, but it's not really good either - just a lot of mediocre pieces that fit well into the background of an anime, with nothing as moving as ""Salva Nos."" I'll still listen to it for background noise at work, but that's about it."
5,Excellent Value for the Money.,"I use the DL 160 alternatively with AT 440ML. Both are excellent, though differ in sound reproduction. Denon excels in sonical detail, low background noise, but the music sounds a bit dry. Audio Technica on the other hand gives the vinyl more warmth but has a smaller sound stage, less defined detail and higher background noise.The choice between these two cartridges depends on personal preferences and the kind of music one listens to. Having very eclectic taste myself, switching between both is a real blessing.Based on Technics 1200MKII turntable and Cambridge 640P phono stage here are my recommendations for each cartridge.Denon's best for: rock music (Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones); older albums (those 50's and 60's pressing of Ella Fitzgerald or Frank Sinatra); anything with scratches and surface noise.AT excels with vocal music (Johnny Mathis, Simon and Garfunkel), pop (Abba, Supertramp), classical (Pavarotti, Bernstein) and of course The Beatles.LONG LIVE VINYL!!!"
5,Excellent book about the plight of Palestinians,"This is an excellent book that provides a dramatic and an inside look into the plight of Palestinians. For all the anti-Palestinians out there, this book cannot possibly be considered anti-semitic because it was written by a Jewish immigrant who had her eyes opened to the cruelty of the Israeli occupation.A must read for anyone who still has any doubt that Palestinians suffer for no reason other than the fact that the racist Zionist regime believes that Palestinians are sub-human and should be pressured through force and inhumane treatment out of their home land."
2,Beautiful Scenery Poorly Transfered From VHS to DVD,"I ordered this DVD due to the good reviews. Well, that was a mistake. This DVD is a sloppy transfer from the VHS version which was filmed in the 1990's. The scenery of course is spectacular, but there are zigs, zags, white lines, jumpy camera scenes and a few skips mostly during the 2nd half of the show. Having just returned from Ireland, I popped in one of our own video's and it looks more professional and better edited than this DVD. Kultur Video's turn out to be poor quality."
3,Scenery: Exactly what it says is,"This DVD is exactly what its title claims: scenery of Ireland. Yes, the video is magnificent! But it would have been much more meaningful to someone who's never been there before to know more specifically what he/she is looking at. The video is divided into 4 areas of Ireland. Captions or a voiced description would have been helpful. With every move of the mouse, the video re-starts which is aggravating, and makes it difficult to utilize the control buttons at the bottom of the screen."
4,"Slick design, easy to use","This slick looking hard-drive enclosure sits next to my laptop that I use daily for work. At the end of each day, I simply turn it on (I leave the USB connected) and my computer instantly recognizes the drive. I backup my drive and then disconnect using the little icon in the system try, just like you would with a USB thumb drive. Very easy to use."
4,Great drive enclosure,"What I like most about this one compared to what I had is that it has no fan and is therefore very quiet. There is enough metal surface area to keep it cool (even to the touch). Nice design too, although that was secondary for me. I have mine laying flat (under the monitor) and it works well in that position. All in all, a solid performer. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars overall is the power supply (wall wart). It is a bit bulky and doesn't have a very long cable. I had to use an extension cord to place it close enough so that the cable would reach. All my other accessories (speakers, USB hubs, etc.) have longer power supply cables."
1,external backup drive,"This unit is poorly designed. It is difficult to install the hard disk in and feels like it is going to break as you do install the drive. Cable connections and frame for drive leave a lot to be desired. Once successful installation was complete, the unit did function well."
4,versatile but a little awkward with transformers,I have been using this for my entertainmetn center for a few years and has performed as expected. The multiple angles allow for bulky transformers and cords coming from different angles but the end result is a tangled looking mess. Still it works and that is probably unavoidable. I always look for a flat plug so that is nice but the cord comes off straight down rather than to the side meaning it will block the outlet below. I just use the bottom plug so it is not an issue but it is something to consider if you have other constraints (plugs that are controlled by a light switch etc). this is a minor issue though. In all I have been happy with it...
5,Excellent Buy,This is my 2nd purchase of this surge protector. I like the form factor. It's much preferred over the typical strips by everyone in my house as they are always trying to borrow my other one. I've never had a problem with the other one after over a year. I use it primarily for my computer. I bought this one for my Xmas Village display and will use it after the holidays for a TV unless someone in my family sneaks it away.
5,great music from the kitchen.,"this is a fantastic cd. music recorded in a home, not a studio, with a fresh energetic feel. all lovers of bluegrass should have this, and even if you have no other bluegrass recordings, i don't see how you could not love the great music on this disc."
4,What a fascinating listen.,"Haujobb's singer tweedles out some of the most bizzare drum'n'bass-esque tunes you'll ever hear on this release. While Photek and roni size get all of the press, the true genious locks himself away and produces records. Daniel Myer's just a frame of a ""hero"" (polarity!).But to call this drum and bass is really a stretch. S'apex is really hard to describe. I guess the sound is undefineable except that it is really digital. Very cool synth washes effectively set the mood, but, it's so, loungey. Yeah, loungey. The combination of synth washes, clicks, slow-mo pitch-bent basslines, rare and random drum patterns, and occasional soft vocal harmonies give this record a jazzy feel. Jazz for the 21st century maybe? I don't know... this record is just fascinating from start to finish. It's something that you sit, listen, and wonder to."
4,"Great watch, poor service","I've has this watch for over a year now and used it almost everyday. Loved the solid feel on my wrist and got many compliments! But sadly, the band didn't last long. I've been trying to get a replacement band for a while now but they have only one service center in Arkansas, and its from Timex, not Nautica (not that I care, so long as I get my band replaced). Great watch, poor after-sales service. That's why the four-star rating."
5,Great looking watch,"Great looking watch. I am not used to wearing a watch so it's a little heavy to me. The face is large so it's super easy to read. The strap is surprisingly comfortable for rubber. And it's easy to set up once you find your model in the booklet. Overall, a great purchase."
3,Cool Watch....but too large,"HUGE dial !! the watch style and looks were good, but the dial was too big for comfort. Returned the product, now waiting for a 46 mm (Case Diameter) watch from Nautica."
3,"Good watch, but not very comfortable !",The watch leaves impressions(if you wear it moderately tight) on your wrist/hand and not very comfortable ! Good product though !
1,very bad product,"this product is a big scam an opportunity to buy it because they said it was water resistant to 100 meters deep, and nothing is pushed the water and damage, I was moved by warranty and again the same thing happened again and the worst is that I'm in Venezuela and therefore I have to pay so much for shipping that is not worth the trouble to return it ..... I demand to compensate me for this watch unusable"
1,Phonics by any other name...,"...is still phonics...while calling it ""phono-graphix"" may be little more than a sales ploy, the authors indeed seem not to understand the phonics method as it's currently practiced...they seem to confuse phonics with the language that appears in many so-called ""basal"" readers -- e.g. ""See Spot run. See Bob run. See Spot and Bob run.""...such ""basal"" readers have very little relation to true phonics instruction...regardless, what the book presents is in fact basically just old-fashioned phonics...phonics probably is best for getting down the basics necessary for starting reading...but there are other phonics options -- my own favorite is ""Explode the Code""...""Reading Reflex"" is adequate but there's nothing special about ""phono-graphix""...shop around -- there's better stuff available."
5,THE BEST FOR ACNE SCARS & RED MARKS ....,"THE BEST FOR ACNE SCARS & RED MARKS ..I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS COMPANY DISCONTINUED THIS CREAM..BECAUSE IT REALLY WAS THE BEST..I AM REALLY SAD THAT THEY HAD TO GET RID OF IT:( IT WORK WONDERS FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS..GLOWLY PEACHY SKIN...FLAWLESS..I DON'T KNOW WHAT MAGIC POTION THEY PUT IN THIS WONDERFUL BOTTLE BUT..FOR ALL OF YOU LOOKING TO BUY ..BY NOW CUZ THEY ARE GOING TO BE SOLD OUT!!!THEN CALL THE Neutrogena AND COMPLAIN TO THEM TO BRING THIS PRODUCT BACK TO THE SHELF!!! I GUESS WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS MAYBE MAKING NEW PRODUCTS CONTAINING LIL SAMPLES OF THE PRODUCT MIX WITH OF STUFF TO MAKE MONEY..BUT WHAT THEY DONT KNOW IS THAT THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST AND THEY DONT NEED TO ADD OTHER STUFF TO IT CUZ 1 . IT HEALS ACNE,SCARS,MARKS,REDNESS,UNEVEN SKIN,HYDRATES,GLOWY-PEACHY SKIN..MAKES IT FLAWLESS IN 100 DAZE OF USE!!! CALL THIS COMAPANY TODAY & BRING IT BACK !!!!"
5,(An Awesome Alarm Clock),I got this clock last year for Christmas and I loved it. I think it is an awesome alarm clock. Not to great of a radio though. You have to adjust a large antenna that is a wire to get any reception at all. Other than that it is awesome. (...)
5,Superb construction,"I tried the Canon 60 macro for a month and it was okay but ended up buying the 70 mm Sigma macro. The extra reach and, IMO, much sturdier build quality decided my purchase. Three other lenses I own are Canon L lenses, so I am critical about lens quality. The Sigma 70 macro is as sharp as a tack. A superb lens."
2,Couldn't Finish It,"I tried to understand what was going on in this book, but wasn't able to complete it. The storyline itself isn't bad, but the writing needs major improvement. There were unneeded descriptions, flat dialogue, and I couldn't relate to the one-dimensional characters. The writing was juvenile in nature and offered zero insight. My suggestion is that Wanda studies books written by successful authors to see what it is that makes their books engaging and also take some writing classes that will help strengthen her storytelling skills. That's the good thing: a so-so writer can always enhance and hone their skills and I believe that she can do it. Good luck with the next one."
2,What was the point?,"All the time I am reading this book, I am thinking what's the point. Yes, women get in bad relationships and stay to long. That's a given. THey sometimes meet a Mr Right and get on with a wonderful life. That's good. But Angela and Steven's story was so boring, so mudane and so not there. HIs ex-wife was hardly mentioned and there was no comparsion between the two. Scenes were overly described and most unnecessary. THe cover says the book is happy, sad, humorous and witty and climaxes in an unexpected ending. I found none of these traits. I can sum it up in one word Boring."
1,Review,"I was kind of disappointed in this video. Everyone looked sad, and the quality wasn't too high."
2,Amateur style,"Not what I thought is would be, a bit of an amateur video.I felt as if I was watching someones home movies!"
5,Great Book,"This was a gift for a younger female who was recently given her first handgun. I haven't read the book personally yet, but she reports that it is a very information and enjoyable read. I plan on borrowing it when she's finished (and she recommends that I do.)"
4,School for lovers,That a therapist would teach men how to be better lovers was intriguing enoughto make me watch her sessions on TV. The sight of Maureen Sullivan nakedwas a treat while seeing her male patients naked was not. What was not revealedin these sessions was whether or not this is a common technique used by alltherapists up to and including intercourse with the patients.Avid Film Fan
2,"Give a hoot, read a book...but not this one.","I agree with some of the other reviewers that the initial premise of this book seemed promising at the start. The further into the book I got though, the more this promise started to wane. I only finished this book because I had paid money for it. The final chapters were actually skimmed rather than read (reading for enjoyment is not supposed to be a chore).As an example of what I didn't like about the book can be found in the last chapter, the coronation of Robert the Bruce. Numerous pages described who was there, who stood where, who said what. Very dry. I thought this was a novel, not ""The Cambridge Journal of Historical Analysis""! All to what purpose? I still don't know. I was surprised that the authors didn't describe what Sir Whoisname's wife was wearing (that color of gown just does not go with her hair!) and how the floral arrangements were picked out by the monk with the bad skin condition.I'll end my comments with one word. Tedious."
4,Don't interrupt me when I am telling you you are nothing. Robert Downey Jr. LOL!,I love this movie! Really catchy and well written songs impressed me the most and in the end credits AMH had a hand in writing or co-writing most of them. Great dialogue and interaction with the other actors. Not familiar with the Twain story but the plot is pretty basic with alot of fun and lively acting by AMH as well as all the others in the film. I love this one as much a a Gnome named Gnorm which is not available for purchase. I taped mine off the tv years ago! If you are a fan of AMH and Jackson (every one has to start somewhere in the movie business!) and Nelson and Downey then give this one a shot. It is not as bad as people claim it is and it is humorous and a good pace setting. I hope you will give it a try.
3,Interesting but flawed - on balance worth the read,The book is full of fascinating facts but falls between academic review and entertainment. There is no clear coherent thesis but enough stories to make a very enjoyable read nonetheless
3,The inevitability of creation,"This book is yeat another example of evolutionists' leaps of faith. Instead of comming to the obvious conclusion that the convergence of biological principles and mechanisms is the result of the inteligent design of a Common Creator, the author concludes by the inevitability of evolution. This is not fact. This is the author's convenient interpretation. Frankly I don't see any evidence that supports that conclusion. All the evidence supports instantaneous creation ex nihilo.The convergence of millions of nucleotides to precisely build and sequence aminoacids, proteins, molecular machines and cells and to assemble all that in highly complex and diverse biological organisms and systems cannot be axplained both by gradualism or by saltationism. It can only reasonably be the result of creation ex nihilo by a Super Intellect, God ""the author of Life""."
2,Bad,I know what the warranty said but this thing just shut off after a week of use. Next time I am going to buy a better brand and not care so much about the price!
5,Great product!,"Boiron makes great stuff which seem to work for me although wikipedia says homeopathy doesn't work. Fine but it works for me. Thus I rec this product - Arnica - for those seeking some pain relief. You can use it with Arnica gel as well. Amazon sells this product - actually Merchant Direct does - for a buck cheaper than other places and shipping was blazingly fast. Ordered on weekend and waiting for me on Monday - can't get any better than that using prime. Expected delivery not until Wednesday and yet here it is. Just what I wanted, saved some money, gas, and hassle through Amazon. Sweet!"
3,Boil Baby Boil,"I bought this pot a year ago and have now used it several times.The positive features:It holds 3 quarts so it holds enough broth for 4 people to easily cook at the same time.It has a thermostat.It is non-stick.It is easy to clean.It cooks cheese fondues without scorching****.The Negatives:Too big to use for Chocolate Fondue.The thermostat is very finicky. It is seemingly either boiling or off, but with much fiddling you can get it to keep cheese warm.The cord constantly falls off.Overall I think it is worth the money, just be warned it may drive you insane trying to get the temperature to the correct setting, and you will loathe the cord.If you are in need of a big pot, this is a fair buy. Buy a smaller (1.5 quart) for some appetizer and dessert fondues as this one is way to big."
4,Just like the good old days of Fonduing,"This is JUSt like your Mom's fondue pot, only better with a great magnetized cord (no more pulling and jerking to get the cord out, causing spills in the pot). We had a great time with this pot, well big enough to serve the five people we had present (with leftovers). Clean up is a breeze. The only oddity is the separate plastic ring that is supposed to hold the forks away from the metal rim; it's okay, but seems unnecessary and probably will get lost. Other than that, fondue away!"
4,"My book was an interesting,fun,exciting book that i enjoyed.","I think the main character was Hoffman.He learned to tend to his own buissiness,not to steal,and to leave other people alone.I learned alot from this book.I learned that you never do something that is wrong-no matter how much the person pays you.I also learned that you get consequences for doing wrong,meaning-if you break a law you will get a ticket,have a trial,maybe go to jail or even be killed as a consequence for doing wrong.The book I read came together ,it was exciting."
5,Does the Job,This is a very nice pepper grinder in a sea of junk grinders. It feels solid and well designed in the hand. It is easy to set a fine or coarse grate and it keeps the setting. It is easy to fill and it looks nice on the table.
4,Fizik Bar Gel,"The Bar Gel fits ok under the handle bar tape. I am still trying to decide how well it works. At this point, I have ridden around 100 miles using the Bar Gel. Since winter is starting, the temperatures when I ride have ranged from zero Fahrenheit up to about 30. I have either ridden with thick gloves or heavy mittens which also do a good job of damping vibration. I installed the Bar Gel after a recent bike re-build. While I was waiting for the Bar Gel to arrive, I made several rides with bare aluminum handle bars. It was noticeable how well aluminum conducted heat out of my hands. The Bar Gel and new tape certainly helped me keep my hands warmer. I will have to wait until next spring when I can ride bare handed to decide if the Bar Gel really makes any difference. My initial impression is that the $18 I spent on the Bar Gel would feel about as good in my pocket as the Bar Gel does when I ride. Maybe I will have a different opinion after my first century this spring."
3,Wanders from it's central premise,"The first several pages of this book were good, and showedcomparisons of old and new buildings, and reinforced his premisethat missing regulating lines and the lack of attention to thearrangement of elements are responsible for much of thedecline in architectural quality.However, much of the rest of the book devolves into a disjointedgrabbag of architectural topics, along with comparisons of howthe human face or maple trees match the golden section with verylittle concrete in the way of design guidance or examples.I'm sure Hale is a good architect, and I would hire him in an instant,(especially after my architect put windows randomly all over our houseand didn't understand why I didn't want 4 styles of windows),but this book is poorly organized, doesn't make his point properly,and wanders far off topic."
3,Jazzy but lacking in ecstasy.,"All the correct ingredients - a great interpreter of French music, a great ensemble and one of the masterpieces of this century - but strangely lacking in the right emotions to successfully convey Messiaen's outrageous visions of joy. To give credit, YPT takes the work at a cracking pace, especially the magnificent finale, but he loses the sense of overwhelming pathos, particularly on the final blazing F# major chord which is not held for anywhere near as long as we have come to expect from rival versions(Myung-Whun Chung & Riccardo Chailly). Hence, a good recording (Chandos have sumptuous sound as always) but not the best recording."
2,Freni shines in poorly recorded video.,"Giordano's Fedora may be a good opera but you will never find out from this video. On the positive side, the two principalsMirella Freni and Sergei Larin are both excellent, especially Freni,who dominates the performance with her superb dramatic acting and fine voice. The supporting cast is also very competent.Unfortunately, there are many drawbacks. The sound recording is poorly balanced, it favours the singers to the extent that the orchestra is suppressed and the overall effect is distorted.There are no subtitles, only a hasty synopsis on the tape box.The conducting of Stefano Ranzani seems only adequate, but that could be attributed to the bad balance already referred to.There is no information as to the origin of this performance, it looks like a provincial Italian house with the irritating custom of loudly cheering and applauding singers on entering the stage.Fedora needs a great recording to show its worth. This one isnot."
2,Disappointing,Not what I expected (from a Wales resident). Hardly holiday. I need 10 more words which I'm finding hard to come up with).
1,Not by Mannheim Steamroller!,"I did not keep this CD as it is advertised as performed by Mannheim Steamroller. It includes a variety of groups all performing medieval music, but M. S. is not included! I was very disappointed."
3,Mediocre Chip Davis,"The arrangements are good except quality lacks. The tracks are frequently different sound levels, so one must constantly turn up or down to hear clearly."
5,Digging This Book,"If you're a student of Cold War culture, many of the source materials used throughout One Nation Underground will be familiar to you. That's not to imply that One Nation is boring, regurgitated, or any such adjective. Rather, Rose has crafted and extremely interesting look at how fallout shelters, for a brief period of time, was on the tip of everyones tongue, and yet despite the warnings and fears, America as a whole pretty much refused to dig in. Rose not only looks at the politics behind fallout shelters, but the historical, scientific, and cultural aspects, providing many sides both for and against civil defense, and explaining why those against won the argument and America's psyche. Rose's prose is never boring and always enlightening. A must read for any CW culture afficionado."
1,"Pretty, but useless.","It looks nice, it's slick, it's solid and protects your Palm. But it makes it impossible to put the Palm into it's cradle, so if you want to synchronize, you have to remove it. This is a task which, though trivial, is something you have to do so often as to make the product not worth using.I'm really surprised that none of the other reviews mention this. If they had, I would never have bought the damned thing. I'm very disappointed with it - I've bought a lot of expensive doorstops, but it isn't even heavy enough for that!"
1,Don't Buy this Case - It Will Damage Your Palm V,"With this case, every time you turn on your Palm V, it triggers the ""contrast"" button at the top of the unit, and you have to keep pressing ""done"" on the screen to remove the message. Many times this process repeats over and over making it very frustrating to use the Palm V in this case. I wish I could return it. It is a waste of money. Find a better fitting case."
5,"Incredibly , Sweet,, Courageous, Loving and Inspiring","This is a nostalgic book about a more wholesome, innocent and much sweeter time. The characters are so loveable--you just want to read and read and wish the book would never end.Travis, Karen, Boogie and their friends are incredible. Their adventures are non-stop, engrossing and wholly laced with love, respect, innocence, courage and hope.The ending is amazingly surprising and up-lifitng.I sincerely hope there'll be a sequel--This is a story that will be loved and enjoyed by ALL ages."
5,best graphics tablet,i haven't tried the other companies but i can hardly imagine anything better than the intuos 3. it works great. plenty of options to customize it how u like it.
1,Bad Cord,"Wacom makes a great tablet, so this is not a complaint to Wacom products, just this item in particular. The cable tends to lose connection, so I have to disconnect and then reconnect the USB for my computer to receive input again. The problem is not the computer itself as I had tested the ports and the drive again and again."
4,good tablet,"I upgraded from an original intuos to the intuos 3 (same size). The pad as a whole seems more substantial and solid. I like the thicker pen and soft grip. The only drawback for me is the two sections of buttons and touchpads. Out of habit, i rest my hand all over the pad when i'm drawing, and i accidentally click buttons and zoom in and out of my paintings all the time which is quite annoying. You can disable the clicking buttons, but i can't seem to disable the touchpad which zooms in and out. This annoyance is forgiveable, but i would rather have no extra buttons, and a cheaper price."
4,Wacom Intuos 3,"The Wacom Pen tablet arrived as promised in good condition. However, the software that was promised has never arrived in spite of 2 attempts to contact the seller regarding the matter. A response would have been appreciated and professional."
4,CUSTOMER WARNING : Beware of refurbished units selling as new.,"Have several Intuos3 tablets, and the device itself is really good. Some issues with MacOS X drivers were resolved two months ago.However, this is not a review of a product. Be warned that some sellers are selling refurbished units as new, and not marking the difference, either in price or shipping. My latest purchase involved a refurbished unit, and seller refused to ship a non-refurbished one.I love Intuos3. But beware of misleading sellers."
5,Amazing Drawing Tablet,"I thought that the tablet might be useless, b/c I thought it might be hard to draw w/o ink coming onto the tablet, so that I could see what I was doing, but magically, looking at the screen while you draw is JUST as easy! Finally, there's a way for people to use technology to their advantage w/o having to worry about their drawings coming out weird when done with a mouse. And if you make mistakes, there's no eraser marks, you can add special effects, and there are layers. If you draw something amazing, but find that it's not in the right place or it's not the right size, on the computer, that can easily be fixed w/o having to erase anything. Get this tablet, b/c it works way better than you think."
1,Misleading product description,"This product has 3 functions within one stylus: PDA stylus, Laser Stylus and Ball pen. This probably works well for what it could do, but it's not functionally compatible with the Sony PSP or Sony Playstation1 (PS1) or Playstation2 (PS2). The product title is misleading to consumers, since the PSP, PS1 and PS2 do not have a touch screen. DO NOT BUY FOR YOUR PSP, PS1, or PS2![...]"
4,"Good book, solid advice","I have been playing Gin for over 10 years, about the last four of which have been for decent money - nothing crazy, but enough. This book helped me understand some things I am doing wrong with my game. The stories and jokes were a little stale and dated, but the playing advice was solid. I've improved my game through this book. Worth the money."
4,"Interesting! ""Never ask too much""... ;)","If you're a local fan, you'll be quite disappointed with the album because it's not their old style. But overall, I think it's enjoyable to listen to. I like all the ballad songs! :) New style, definitely. To those of you who're 'the new believers', do visit their official website for more info."
4,Worth the money,"Fire was actually one of the few songs on Expereience that I actively disliked. I liked Jericho, but the same version is in the album. It is the last two tracks that stand out. Pamdemonium is a great high-energy dance track that deserved to be in Experience more then Fire. And the remix of Jericho is considerably better than the album version."
5,Tugs at your Heart strings!,"The Wrong Side of the River is a book that takes you on a emotional roller coaster ride from the start to the finish.Mr. Johnson's book tells us about triumph over his childhood. He faced many obstacles to become the person he is today. He broke the cycle of alcoholism that ran in his family for years.His story teaches us that we can overcome any thing we might face in this world. No matter what is going on.No matter how big or how small it might be. We can come out of it as a stronger, happier person. Mr. Johnson had a great grandmother who taught him about God. It was by the grace of God that gave him the strength to say, ""Enough is Enough"".I would love to hear about the rest of his story. This book is a must read for all.NickieFt Riley, KS"
4,Great Deal Police Academy Films.,"This quite a great deal on these films on disc so the downside is that it is double sided disc but than it's also a good thing, both films are in widescreen so that great of warners brothers to do that. if you are police academy fan then this kinda of deal to get two films for such a low price. the only reason i give four stars is the transfer of picture on both films looks a little dark maybe it the dvd player i'm using oh well good deal anyway, this also comes with special features one on each side. Oh Police Academy 2 is PG-13 for Lauguage and brief nudity. 3 is PG for Lauguage and action scenes.Update: again this disc has both films and is double sided hello. i guess the guy in the review below did'nt bother to check the other side of the disc before complaining in his review. oh brother some people make me crazy."
4,Great Single with Oustanding Extra Tracks,"The Cure were riding a high with the ""Disintegration"" album in 1989. This single (make that EP) runs 5 tracks, 27 min. and is really great all around.""Pictures of You"", the outstanding track of ""Desintegration"" shows up here in a slightly different (remixed) version from the album and, more importantly, not the full length version, reason I cannot rate this 5 stars.The extra tracks, though, are outstanding. They contain live versions of ""Last Dance"", ""Fascination Street"" (since then a concert fave), an outstanding ""Prayers for Rain"", and last but not least an 8 min. live version of the title track of ""Disintegration"". Just fab."
4,Hysterically and Hauntingly funny!,I read this book when I was 19 or 20; I just read it again at 53. I still find its acerbic and caustic humor mixed with genuine pathos brilliant.
2,"cute, but not what I wanted","I wanted the rose night light and you can't choose which one that you get. I received the moon style. It was cute however, it stays on all the time. That could be a safety concern to me. If anyone has any of the rose night lights let me know and I will buy them from you."
1,I didn't like it,A cruel and sarcastic novel about a creepy main character who is even less likeable than the flawed parents he can't seem to forgive for giving birth to him. Autobiography?
2,beware,"I bought this thinking that it would be compatible with windows vista, it's not. The instructions on how to play each individual game does not work, so if you know how to play all the games then it's a great CD. If you don't then your screwed"
3,wuhan china 14 inch a particular piece,"i bought this to try a new sound, and it is, its not ugly, its not bad, a little weird,..maybe. its really loud, which its good and if you hit hard you got a very unique sound from a 10 i put it a 7, the base of the cymbal its not rounded its a little squared ...lucky!!"
2,She should stick to short stories...,"I picked this up because I had read her ""Impossible Things"" and liked it, also because I liked the brief on the back cover. I give this a two star rating rather than a one because the subject matter is interesting. The chapters go on and on longer than they need to and the book sometimes seems like a first draft rather than a final copy because there are many things that haven't been taken out. I sped through the last 80 pages not because I was gripped by the book, but rather, after reading the first 700 pages, I had invested too much and just wanted to be through with it."
2,Call me a quitter.,"I tried, but I could not finish this book. I was halfway through-which had been a test of endurance-and realized that nothing had really happened. The author spends a lot of time on conversations between characters that frankly makes them even more 2 dimensional than were to begin with. All the characters come off as way too cute-they are really quite unbelievable, and yet, this is not intended as tongue in cheek. It only seems like it should be."
5,Be carefull what you wish for!!,"Joanna Lander is a doctor that is lives, breathes, works in a hospital that is set up like a giant labyrinth. She then starts on a project that leads her into a different type of labyrinth. The story at this point becomes almost dizzing. It almost seems like the characters will never stop going in circles. Then suddenly there is a MAJOR plot twist and everything stops. The rest of the characters are trying to figure out what Joanna figured out and in the proccess fufill the three wishes that Joanna made during the first half of the book.This was a compelling book that I couldn't put down and in spite of the 780 pages I read in under two days. The ending made me cry though."
3,Hit and miss,"I think the three-and-a-half rating this book has achieved through the 200 reviews is about right -On the plus side, there was something compelling and haunting about the topic- In the 2 weeks spent reading this book, I think I had nightmares/unsettled dreams on three nights - I think that shows the underlying nature of the NOT THAT IT IS A SCARY BOOK, but it is definately thought provoking and disquietingOn the negative side, it goes on far too long (the editing comments all apply, it has some repetitive passages which could have been abbreviated)Another black mark against this book (contrary to the blurb on the inside cover) is that I thought the characters were a little bit two-dimensional (the various main characters were never seen through any other lense than thier work lives - I think it would have added a lot to bring in a few more of the supporting cast (parents, sister etc) - both to break up the storyline and flesh them out as individuals)"
3,Worth reading but frustrating for some,"A little slow and repetitive, with uncomplicated characters. Also, a little unsubtle with the repeated mention of metaphors, but I think it drives home a more rewarding read of the book: I read the book not so much as character driven but as idea driven, with the hospital and the NDE destination representing the relationship between life, death, dreams, or whatever the reader decides. That is, what does the hospital, where nobody knows how to get from one part to another, or one person knows one path but not another remind you of? How does this relate to the NDE destination? This book is perhaps not executed as well as it could have been, but it investigates an interesting topic and raises interesting questions."
2,Needed to be about 1/3rd shorter,"I really wanted to like this, but I couldn't finish it. About 4/5ths of the way through, after the last tedious plot twist I finally decided this wasn't fun any more, and not even worth reading to find out the ending. Her writing really needed tightening. She overindulged in extensive passages with lots of technical jargon, labored needlessly over character development, and after the nth foray onto the dream Titanic, where she seemed to go about a foot further every time, it was just too much for me. Often she seemed like she was writing for neurologists who were Titanic buffs, which is an awfully small target audience. I am actually fascinated by neuroscience and psychology, and it was starting to bore me. Those of you who aren't all that into it, I can't imagine would like it better. I also did not feel the obvious jabs at the Titanic film, although I too didn't like it, were really necessary, and they kind of knocked me out of the book's world each time."
2,Boggled by the raves,"I read a glowing review of this Book on Salon--a source I respect--so I felt fairly confident that I'd enjoy it. Instead, I found myself bogged down in a surfeit of unnecessary details and overworked themes (how many times are these people going to get lost in the hospital, for Pete's sake?) True, I was a little surprised by the culminating events, but I had a real problem with the author's take on near death experiences as versions of early 20th century disasters. If this is the case, then what did someone like Jesus see when he met his end?"
3,Could someone please post how the book ends.,I also quit reading this after about 200 pages. It was horrible.But I'm still curious how it ended. I tried briefly flipping through the end pages but I couldn't find out anything. (I sold the book years ago)Thanks
3,The most riveting book I've not really liked.,"I love Connie Willis books and I was prepared to love this one too. Like all Willis books, it is extremely well written. I literally couldn't put it down, right to the end. I was spell bound and intrigued with the whole NDE question and I loved the characterizations. But at the point in the book when the plot takes a dramatic turn (if you've read the book, you'll know what I mean), I started feeling disatisfied and disappointed. Things started getting way too wierd for my taste and the ending completely fizzled. That said, I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. 3 stars for writing style, suspense and characters; -2 for wierdness and dumb conclusion."
2,Not That Good,"I got this dvd without researching whats on it. I regreted it afterwards. Its not good, its not bad though either. Now a biography tape might sound good, you think that there will be interviews with the members, concert footage, and other stuff like that. But then i got it and it ended up to be a documentary. I was really dissapointed. Even though the information is really interesting, the person they have presenting it gets really annoying. You do get to see a lot of cool pictures though. I have this on dvd. Whats good about that is it has a trivia game which you should play only after the movie is over. If your a big koRn fan you might find some enjoyment out of this film like I did. But even alot of koRn fans will think this really sucks."
1,KoRn shouldn't be treated like this!,"This is the worst video on a band ever. This video doesn't have anything useful in it, other than lots of the same pictures of the band that all korn kids have seen before. I didn't even finish the video... it sucks that bad ( i had to put in ""Who Then Now?"" to re-new my faith in KoRn, ""R U Ready"" put me in a haze of bad video)Don't make a mistake and by this tape!"
2,must be an idiot,"Was not helpful in starting, had to have someone show me. Wouldn't recommend the book."
1,Very basic poor job for an options book,"Bernie really let himself down with this book. Very poor job. Basic stuff. Shame he triesto build a name. I still remember him touting DOW 11,000 in cassettesthat disappeared when we went to 7,500. An opinion for every season.Intended to sell his poor performing newsletters."
1,Bernie Hides from his Audience,"I agree totally with the comments about this book. Bernie Scheffer has missed his speaking events to apparently avoid embarrassing meetings with his public to explain his newsletters losing trades.Good in theory, lose money following his newsletter. The book is not worthy to read, but if you buy his newletter and follow his recommandations, you will surely lose money quickly. That is my experience."
1,Almost 2 stars but the sales calls pushed it back to 1,"I bought the book from Bernie's web site and then got lots of sales calls. Wow what a mistake that was.OK book. Nothing new. Stick with McMillan, Natenburg and Fontanills for original material."
3,"Easy hookup, but limited function","Very easy install. (Jeep Liberty) Have had problems with the brake lights. i've checked and re-checked all connections including grounds, but the brake lights will occasionaly quit working. If I unplug the pigtail and plug it back in they will work. I suspect a flaw in the digital converter box."
5,great gift,This was a valentines day gift for my mom and she absolutely loved this basket. She said there are a lot of yummy goodies inside.
4,Good product,Was what we'd hoped for. My mom really enjoyed it. Review is requiring nine more words but I've said all I have to say. :)
1,NOT WHAT I ORDERED.,"I ordered the Gourmet Food Basket as a Christmas gift for a coworker of mine, excitedly so, because she loves things such as these. When the package arrived, I couldn't wait to open it, and inspect it to make sure that it was what I ordered. Unfortunately for me, it was not. Instead of being sent WHAT I ORDERED, I was sent the Green Tea Zen Calming Spa Bath and Body Set Gift Basket. The basket itself is beautiful, and filled with all sorts of products, but again it was NOT what I ordered. What if the person I was gifting this to was allergic to such things?"
5,A Good compliment to his first book,"""Dying Well"" is an incredible book! This is a wonderful supplement! This man is a wonderful writer which adds to enjoyable reading knowing it comes from real experience."
5,"Great Movie, Great Book!","""The Patriot"" novel expounds and expands rather nicely on one of the most significant and remarkable movies I have ever seen. Yes, the film is violent, but the semi-fictionalized history that it presents, and the very much non-fictionalized values and ethics it displays (take note of the high level of Christian imagery -- prayer and the cross are seen often) are valuable reminders of what founded this once-great nation, much of which has been forgotten. As for the novel, it is able, as most books of movies are, to expand the personal lives and detail events far more than the limited time of a movie can. One might suspect that some scenes presented in the novel might well have been filmed, but edited in the final cut. I suppose we shall simply have to wait for the DVD. Meanwhile, if you in any way enjoyed ""The Patriot"" in the theater -- bring the book home and read it."
4,Awsome,I think this book was very good. I think it was good because it touched my heart greatly the way a father has love and compasion for his children and his country. This book shows the values of life and how much one country means to one man. This book expressed the meaning of what it is to be a patriot. I give this book a four star rating because it could of made the outcome more explicit and detailed. I highly recommend this book for any one who likes adventure and war stories. This book is a great way to read and have fun at the same time!
2,Poor Quality control,"While the actual sprinkler head works very well - smooth stream of water, even coverage, covers large area with very little noise - The spike base it was attached to had two problems. A seam in the metal directly below the sprinkler head was split, so a constant stream of water squirted out of the base. And the black cap attached to the spike base was cracked, so water also squirted out from there. I attached the sprinkler head to a different base and it works great now. So, as sold the product was useless, but could be fixed by purchasing a new spike base or using one from a different sprinkler."
3,Seymour slows down,"I have read all of Seymour's books and, with the exception of this, enjoyed them from start to finish. I knew from an early stage that this one would labour, and it surely did.Dear Mr Seymour, Dont change a winning formula"
2,"""Gone With the Wind"" the way it should have been. NOT!","The above quote is from JUST IMAGINE's cover and should have been a warning for me not to waste my time with this rewrite. I could never mesh with the lack-luster story or characters. I couldn't even keep enough interest to read through to the end.Phillip's contemporary works are better. Try them instead, if you are a first-time reader, and you'll be pleased."
4,yet another great book by a fantastic author!,"I have pretty much all of the books in this particular series and I have to say,it's a well-written book.The characters seem to all steal the book in their own rights.From Faia and Kirtha to Medwind,to the somewhat infamous kiddie tribe bunch,the Tagnu. It also has enough villians(or are they??)to shake a stick at.Lessons and morals are found throughout a well thought out book.Kudos!!"
1,Not water or sweat resistant,"I tend to sweat a lot and the armband did little to protect my sensor/ipod which shorted out after 984 miles. Purchased new water resistant case from H2O Audio for just 10 dollars more and it keeps everything dry. Granted I average around 9 miles per run but for 29 bucks I expected something a little more durable that would actually protect my nano. Instead I'm now on my second i pod , if you sweat a lot spend the extra 10 bucks and get a real water resistant case. Incidentally Nike just sent me a 2nd gen armband(with the widow) for 1000 miles and it seems to be made from the exact same material as the first one."
2,Not user friendly,"The armband works fine, but it is such a pain! You can't see the screen, it is hard to control the volume, pause, etc... through the fabric and you have to take it out anytime you want to do something. I understand that this is the one with room for the iPod/Nike attachment, but I would try to figure out another solution with a different armband."
1,A Real Pain to Use,"Nothing against the seller, but the item sucks. I have to take my pod out of the armstrap all the time to see the screen. It a real piece of junk. I could cut a hold in the armband, but that would probably look tacky!"
2,A little imcorfortable to use with IPOD Nano,"It lacks a screen where you can see the Ipod screen when starting your workout. You should set it up prior to put your Nano into it. On the other hand, it keeps very well the sweat outside."
1,probably the worst armband ever for the nano,i dont know what moron created this but it makes no sense. you cannot see the screen of your nano. i thought this thing was made for the nano as well as the shuffle but apparently it isnt. im sure the rest of it is fine it just sucks you cant see what the hell you are playing or doing if you have a nano.
5,"Great Cymbal, Best China Sound!","Great cymbal, is exactly what it should be called China, Gong real sound. The cymbal sounds loud and isn't weak at all, don't belive it will break when you hit it, the people who said that, is because they are using a bad technique to hit cymbals and secure they have broke more than one cymbal. It has the exact sound that a China should have, and in size 16"" is perfect for use in quick accents. Excellent quality for the price! The termination is a bit rough compared to other cymbals brands, but doesn't care when you obtain it spectacular sound. good deal, was an excellent choice to buy it."
3,skechers sneakers,"I actually have returned this item and am awaiting a refund. Nothing wrong w/the shoe or the company, just that the shoe tends to run a 1/2 size too small-keep that in mind when ordering."
4,Happy Feet,"The shoes a very nice, I have worn SKECHERS Mules/Slide sneakers for quite a while .This style is a bit narrower then previous but mostly comfortable."
2,You get what you pay for...,"12"" is too small. I have an 18"" with rivets that sounds great, but the 12"" sounds kinda cheap and crappy. I'll find a use for it somehow..."
3,Marriage in its True Forms,"Hollander does a great job of organizing these poems into various themes. I did not read every single one, but I enjoyed those that I had to read for class and would recommend this to anyone really likes poetry. The poems vary from long to short, complicated to sing-songy, and in that reflect marriage itself. They really made me think about my relationship and where I want to end up in 20 years."
2,"Love those Vikings, but book 3 was YUCK","Books 1 and 2 of this trilogy were fun, interesting and enjoyable. Book 3 felt like the publisher told TIM get this book out now or u will miss the window. Lame dialogue and morose religous bs. Barf, ending to what could have been a great closure."
1,Boring,Concept good but novels very boring. Disliked author's style of writing. Foolishly bought all three novels in the series.
3,SO SO,Great set of books if all you use is Hornady bullets. The co-efficency tables are excellent and it does a very good job explaining balistics. However if you want to experiment with brands other than Hornady bullets these books are not much aid.
1,EXERCISE PORTION OF DVD WILL NOT PLAY,"The DVD has 2 sections, one that is a demonstration of Capoeria as practice by professionals and the second section is the actual workout. I wish I could rate the workout but I never got to see it. The DVD only allowed me to access the Capoeria demonstration. Believe me I tried, I have 3 DVD players in my home from a $79.00 ""no brand name anyone would recognize"" one to my LG DVD recorder/player and got the same result on each player. No matter what arrow buttons I pushed it just would not cursor over to ""WORKOUT"". So save your money and the headache of having to return this DVD."
4,Matthew is a most gifted performer,"who I as a new believer did not know of until a mission trip to Russia with him in 1997. Mission trips are a blessing but to have such talent as this along is the icing on the cake. One guess who won the talent show at the orphanage. Now I have all his albums I can get my hands on. His talent overrides the fact I have a lot of Christmas music and it is rare for me to find someone who can sing the same songs in a new, interesting and fresh way. He has the highest percentage of any performer with 4 and 5 star ratings in my iTunes collection. Now in August I'm actually looking forward to the Christmas season, despite Christmas merchandise in stores already, this year so I can listen to him. He is a blessing."
2,A very cheesy movie!,Wow this movie I really wanted to like because the description of this sounded a bit intriguing. a serial killer calling his self the sandman going around killing people then pouring sand on them as his trademark but the plot just falls apart and the special effects in this movie are almost comically bad. the one thing I did like about this move was the music in it.there a really creepy dark lullaby that get played through out the movie the helps set the tone of the movie but outside that this was just a really cheesy bad movie that really puts the B in B movie.
1,"Mr. Sandman, put me to sleep","An obvious re-creation of SHOCKER (which was WIZARD OF OZ compared to this movie) where a family killer is put to death but comes back to life in the form of sand and goes after someone he knows for revenge. Incredibly poor quality low budget flick is unconvincing, boring, and unentertaining. Some low budget fans have forecomingly given this far more credit than it deserves. They can keep it."
4,Sleepstalker...,"Horror, yes. Suspense, yes. Acting, OH YEAH. This one had me turning the lights back on. One thing that really got me was the closing sound track. Teresa Straley's rendition of ""Sleep Baby Sleep"" was not only haunting, but captivating. I only wish that it were available on a sound track album. In my opinion, this movie is, for horror fans, well worth watching. Great direction, but unfortunatly, there is a small problem with continuity. I've seen worse in films with higher budgets. Enjoy it for what it is, but remember to leave the lights on..."
