2,Shipping too slow,"While the product is what I wanted, the shipping was too late. The original shipping indicated that I should have received my pepper in time, but the shipper got the product to UPS late, therefore, I didn't get to use the pepper in the recipe and now I'll have to wait for another time to use it."
3,Ok for now...Genre still needs a good set with better production,"SKA Wars (4 CD Set): There are some fantastic songs that came out of the Ska/Two-Tone movement, but there has yet (even after all these years) to be a proper presentation of its history. This ""Ska Wars"" set is nice, but not with the best examples, not the best live materials, and not the best production. However, its about the only real overview we have that is listenable.I give it Three Stars (really 3 , but I just can't give it Four)."
4,Excellent lounge comedy from a master,"Redd Foxx was before my time, but his comedy remains as potent today as it was during my father's. The 'Live and Dirty' series of albums was recorded in various spots where Foxx performed his stand-up, largely in bars and Vegas spots. His humor was one of the first to be storytelling rather than composed of one-liners and shorts. His stand-up mixed improved and stock humor extremely well, and his delivery is such that even when he creates or points out something visual, your imagination has no trouble catching exactly was was done and meant. While this is definatly not for minors, it is a great tyle of humor for adults."
5,DNA and Leadership,"If you are a leader or if you want to become a leader, Judith Glaser's newest book, ""The DNA of Leadership"" is a must read. My recommendation is to read her other books, ""The Power of We"", and ""Creating We"" at the same time.Judith's E-centric way of looking at the world is a breath of fresh air for those in our family of coaches and leadership consultants. DNA is a book about empowering ones self and others to embrace change, to share a common vision and impact the world around us in a positive way. Through her stories, Judith provides a vision of common people who find the courage to look at themselves, and see how their behaviors have impacted others. Her stories tell us that we are just as capable of making the changes in our own behaviors, changes that allow us to become better leaders.DNA has helped me to understand that what you say is not as important as how you make others feel."
5,Dirty harry box set,As a clint eastwood fan you can't go wrong with this box set of all dirty harry's films. One of the great things about this set is you see the evolution of the character & the changes in styles of action as harry takes on not just crimimals but the politics of being a cop.
4,The Dirty Harry Collection-A Fan Review,This collection of the classic Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry role was excellent!! Each DVD was remarkably clear and captured all of the elements of the big screen. I have thoroughly enjoyed each of the five films. This was money well spent on a good entertainment investment!
3,Dirty Harry Collection,"The collection was priced well and appeared on the website to be packaged well. I purchased 2 copies, 1 for my father for Christmas and 1 to keep. My only issue with the collections was that the case of my copy was damaged and the blu rays were just loose inside. I regret not buying it in a store where I could have heard the discs bouncing around inside. This is the first time I have had this issue with Amazon after probably 10-15 purchases of multi-disc collections."
4,Great For Any Wolvering Football Fan,"This book was a great buy. Written by Schembechler, it gives a great perspective on the team and football from an inside source. Highly reccomended for any Michigan Football fan. Lots of nice pictures as well. GO BLUE!"
4,Good Origami Book,This book is pretty good with lots of models. Only a couple of things I dislike are some of the models do not start from squares ( so you have to do some cutting) and after finishing the introductory folds section it moves quickly to advanced to nearly impossible folds...
5,Very Moving and Emotional....,"One of the most graphic, moving, historical documentaries I've ever seen about a specific battle during a war or conflict. It moved me beyond words. There are several Veterans that speak about their experience during that battle in the documentary. The Korean War is often known as the ""Forgotten War"", but I don't see how. I'll never forget it. Reading the story behind the battle doesn't give it justice, you need to hear it from those who were there. Please buy ""Chosin"", it's remarkable and unforgettable."
1,This product is garbage!!!!!!!,I applied this product following the instructions exactly but less than a week this left my Avalanche looking worse than ever. It peels and splinters like old flaky paint. Before the black trim on my truck was sunfaded but I could use one of the in store products like mother's or some other gel restore and it would last for a week or two before fading away or washing off. Now i have light and dark spots and peeling on the trim. This stuff not only does not work but it makes things way worse!!!! You have been warned. I will try to post some pictures to show how awful it makes the trim look. I may have to get new trim in this stuff doesn't come off in the next wash or two. That is how bad it looks now.
3,"Not a bad overview, has some good ideas, but beware...","The 'Where will the Money come from' chapter , pgs 240-244 on Social Security, is delusional. The author seems to think that Social Security is safe, that pending boomers will get full benefits, and nothing is further from the truth. The author should check the annual letter from Social security that states that withdrawls will exceed contributions within the next 10 years unless something is done. Nothing will be done because our politicians have no spine and are afraid of not being around to milk the tax payer and receive endless kickbacks and graft, all the while being exempt from the very system created as a last resort.His other ideas are good, however, and worth a read. Id get it from the library first before I decided if I wanted to keep this book around."
2,Only some general information,"Please note that I write this review from the perspective of someone who won't be retiring for at least two more decades. I think by the time I retire, the state of the world will be quite different. Hopefully al Queda or the greedy pigs on Wall Street haven't destroyed our beautiful country by then...I got this book in e-book format as part of my Quick WillMaker Plus 2005 software package. It only has some mostly general information, and I don't think it's worth the full price of the printed version. The author promotes the idea that you don't need a lot of money to retire; all you need is a loving family. Sure, and we can just count on social security (which is to be privatized and feeding the greedy Wall Street pigs) and our kids. This guy must be living in some utopian pipe dream.If you want a feel-happy book, this may be for you. Otherwise, get a book that offers practical advice on how to save and what government benefits programs are (still) available."
4,Retirement,Get a Life helps the average person look at the many aspects of their lives in order to formulate a responsible plan for the last third of their lives. It fosters self-reflection about current circumstances and future hopes. Ralph Warner gives advice on investment and provides a look into the lives of individuals who are successfully enjoying retirement.
5,The Adonis Complex,Good educational book for males to understand other males with body concerns and females to understand the male psyche regarding their body concerns.
2,The Adonis Complex,"As a long time bodybuilder, I did not agree with most of the opinions of the authors. Their critical opinions could be said about any athlete: golfer, tennis player, swimmer etc. If you have never trained seriously as an athlete, you just wouldn't understand the dedication which these doctors describe as ""obcessive/complusive"". I was still an interesting read re: the media's influence on young people and giving them unrealistic expectations for sports."
1,light-cycles with monster truck wheels,After playing Tron 2.0 I was left wondering if the designers had actually ever sat through the original Tron movie. Why do the light-cycles have wheels the size of monster trucks?
1,Big thumbs down for Tron 2.0 Killer App.,"Playing Tron 2.0 Killer App. takes me back to my Playstation days as the game looks very basic, possibly made in a hurry and lacks polish. While playing it there is a constant feeling of nothing really going on. Not exactly the hottest Xbox game available at the moment. Weighing the situation up, there are many many superior Xbox games available. Big thumbs down for Tron 2.0 Killer App. Better luck next time Disney."
3,A Mediocre Port To A Great Game,"It's obvious. Tron 2.0 was exactly a hit in the PC world. But I bought it. Now, coming to the Xbox, I thought it was a freaking sequel! How wrong was I. Some sounds are missing, controls for going to and from the subroutine spot really are a pain. The title is sort of right, this is a killer app. Okay for people who haven't played before, but don't expect Half-Life 2."
2,Not good value for your dollars!,"The Civil War Minutes presents 3 hours of topics. It discusses such topics as a soldier's knapsack or backpack as we call it now. The host will read various letters written by soldiers. The host makes a good presentation of the other subjects as well. The subjects are interesting. The period music is good.But the production of the series does not seem professional. There are times when the background noise, such as screams, will drown the presentation the host is trying to present.After viewing the four-part series I feel disappointment. I feel that I did not get much for my purchase. Personally I could have gotten as much information by spending the day at a Civil War museum and would have been better entertained."
5,"Pirates, paradise and promises!","The two episodes in this disc are two of the best of the first season. The FLAX is an episode that focuses on a huge invisible net that captures unwary ships for pirates. This is an interesting idea but the story does not rely on it alone. There is humor, a touching moment where Rygel shows how he truly is a good guy, and an almost sex scene between John and Aeryn.Jeremiah Crichton is about an Earth-like planet, a paradise planet really, that also turns out to be a jail. Kind of. I don't wish to give anything away but there are touching moments, funny moments and, once again, the character development that happens in each and every episode of Farscape is also here."
3,Replacement Sensor,"I bought this replacement after the original outdoor sensor failed. The vendor was great about packing and shipping, it arrived quickly. After installing it I've noted some of the same problems as we experienced with the failed unit. It appears La Crosse has poor quality control.Already there have been a few times its failed to transmit the outdoor temp. I think there's something that goes wrong with the circuitry at certain temps. I've also discovered if you lay it down on a metal surface it cannot send its signal at all.So, I'm hoping it lasts a year. If it doesn't I'll give up on La Crosse and look for someone else. That'll be too bad because the indoor unit is unobtrusive and easy to read."
3,Not accurate but....,"This device works to a point. It does not display the correct outside temp, nor the correct inside temp. This is my second unit and both have developed corroded battery terminals on the outside box. My next one will certainly be a different brand."
3,Sensor isn't sensitive enough,"This is the second outside temperature sensor I have bought for a weatherstation device sold by LL Bean. I think these units require absolutely fresh,strong batteries to operate well. I used two batteries that tested like new,although they may have had a bit of use previously. Outside temperaturesseem to be shown only if sensor is within 15 feet of the base unit.Don't believe I have any other options from other manufacturers."
5,Temperature Sensor,"This sensor did exactly what is suppose to do. I took it out of the box, followed the instructions and it started working just fine. LaCrosse makes a very good product."
3,"Sensor - good, fragile, expensive","The replacement sensor is really quite expensive, almost as much as the original clock and sensor!!!These are pretty fragile, shouldn't be but they are.It works pretty well and is pretty much accurate."
3,Disappointing - my second one,"Bought this as a replacement for the original one that came with my weatherstation. Old one died after 18 months with a battery change in between. It just didn't seem to send a signal to the home base whenever the weather went below freezing. So I bought one to replace it. Now in the throes of winter, it is no longer registering a signal. It is placed only 6 feet away from the base unit, though the signal needs to go through our stucco exterior. Would have expected better and more reliable performance though. Am very ambivalent about buying another one - and not it's not the battery."
1,Amazon made a mistake!,"I can't review the item, just amazon in general as this temp. sensor does not work with the weather station that it links from. I bought the weather station LaCrosse Technology WS-7014CH which receives 915 and 920 Mhz signals, and decided to buy the 'package' that amazon recommends. This sensor transmits at 410 mhz so it is completely useless with the weather station. There is also nothing on this page nor the page for the weather station that give you these facts, so you are out of luck until you order it and then have to deal with returning it."
5,La Crosse Technology TX6U-Works Great,"Original item I purchased 10 years ago with base unit finally succumbed to the weather in Chi-Town. Bought replacement remote about 2 months ago. It synced up with the base unit, per instructions, perfectly and been providing expected temperature info successfully."
2,Not designed for accuracy,"The specs on this unit are +/- 2 degrees ""under normal conditions"". That probably means ""at room temperature."" At winter temps, freezing and below, this unit is over 5 degrees off. La Crosse more or less admits to this on their web site. The saddest thing is that the LaCrosse base stations display outside temperatures to 1/10th of a degree - for a sensor that is +/- 2 degrees at best and generally not even that close."
1,Poor reliability,"I have owned two of the outdoor LaCrosse Wireless Temperature sensors. Both have failed within the first 1.5 years. When the sensor goes out, you will not see the outside temperature on the indoor display. I will NOT purchase another LaCrosse unit."
2,Disappointed,The clock has performed well the past 2 years but the Outdoor Sensor accuracy was off 3-5 degrees when operating. Now the sensor works only indoors within 6 feet of the clock. I must replace the entire package.
1,Useless,"I ordered these and found the remote sensors extremely inaccurate. Sitting on the table, I had 3 of them by the way, and all three were 3 degrees different from each other. Not 10ths, degrees. Not only that, when compared to a Davis (certified unit), they were off by yet another 3 degrees. Company does not have a good quality control. Go with Oregon Scientific, those are a lot more accurate. Sorry La Crosse, you do not cut the mustard. And the transmitters seem to step all over each other, all 3 blanked out for half a day, then came back. You can not select the channel like you can Oregon Scientific units. Try and figure out which one is which."
4,Replacement works fine,This unit is a replacement for the original one that came with my system. It works at a longer range than my first one and I am now able to install it in a preferred place. My old unit read 2 degrees F higher than my laboratory-grade mercury thermometer and this one appears to do the same. I disassembled my old unit and set the potentiometer to calibrate it. Once out of the warranty I will do the same with this one for accuracy.
1,Outside temperature sensors are awful -- don't work or fail often,"The LaCrosse clock works great as a clock and indoor temperature sensor, but the outside temperature sensors fail soon, and replacements are no better and sometimes defective from the start. I have had the clock a few years and have had to order replacement sensors several times. Last two replacements would not work or worked only at room temperature. I will not buy another LaCrosse product; it is disappointing and frustrating to deal with their inferior design or manufacturing, whatever is causing the issue."
1,Not even from the next room!!!,"Purchased as a replacement for the identical transmitter unit that stopped working after a number of years.This piece of junk will transmit the temperature when placed next to my clock. But it CANNOT SENT THE TEMPERATURE FROM THE NEXT ROOM!!! So, it is not be of any use as an outdoor sensor.Do not waste your money."
1,"Good sensor,poorly made","I've had these for several years, but the remote sensor finally quit. Decided to get a new one, and this one didn't even last one month. I'm on the 2nd one, now, so will see if it does any better. La Crosse Technologies has decided to have their products ""made in China"" and you get what you pay for, or maybe not, in this case. Almost fifteen dollars is a lot for less than one month of use!!"
3,nice product,"I'd give it 4 or 5 stars if I did not have to replace it every 12-18 months. Otherwise nice product, precise enough for home use."
3,temp gauge,"seems to work as advertised, at least gives me an idea of what it is like outside. don't know if it's better or worse then any other gauge."
5,Megan's Unicorn,This newly revised edition is excellent and I highly recommend it. It's a wonderful story that will show how love and faith can survive even under the worst of times.
3,what?!,"When I ordered this I didn't realize it was not a standard size softball... it's actually SUPER HUGE! Do people really use this size softball?! If so, how?! lol... way to big to even hold, never mind catch, it wouldn't fit in my daughter's glove. We did have a good laugh though... and the return process was easy and courteous @ eSportsonline. Bottom line, beware in ordering these unless you have big hands. :)"
2,Fell Apart!,"Nice looking pitter, heavy chrome or steel, nice finish. Seemed to work well at first, although I did think the hole was actually too small for about 1/2 of the cherry pits that I had to extract. Then, after a few uses, the stem (the thin piece that actually pushes the pit) fell out! I could only keep using it if, after each pit extraction, I re-inserted the stem into its hole. Hardly an efficient way to pit cherries, especially considering the cherry pitter is supposed to be saving me time. I would recommend finding one where the stem is more securely connected to the body of the piiter. I'll be returning this one."
1,Fell Apart! :(,"It worked great the first 3 or 4 times I used it. Then the stem fell out. (This is the part that cuts and pushes the pit out of the cherry.) From what I can tell, this part was, at best, superglued to hold it together. I'm not amused..."
3,Steel Butterflies: Japanese Women and the American Experienc,"If you would like to know about Japanese women and their situation in Japan, this book will give you pertinent information about them. However, Japanese women whom the author had interviewed were mostly from middle to upper class in Japan. Therefore, you may not find information about other socio-economic levels or positions from other Japanese woman. On the other hand, you will find out how much they are similar to American woman in terms of their identity as women. You will see the evolution of the Japanese woman's identity in a male dominanted society, both in America and Japan."
1,except for keeping time,"After checking out a lot of clocks, chose this basic. Did every thing it said it would except keep time; every 3-4 hours the hands stopped moving. The $5 return charge for the $10 clock made driving over it for Holloween more satisfying."
1,False advertising!,"Do not believe Amazon's advertising of ""Lit by a small light bulb, the clock gives off a soft orange glow"" The light is an extremely bright blue. I guess Amazon has my money and I got stuck. I tried getting the problem solved, but either I have to drive 20 miles to UPS of pay for USPS which they will refund later. I notice that Amazon doesn't properly back up their products.I've now spend two hours on this and have to now fill out a complaint to my attorney general. I guess Amazon cares more about their profits and not enough about their customers or they would have been willing to have mailed me a shipper. All of this over a stupid clock? It's simply not worth it/Amazon."
2,Boring...,"I agree with the one star reviewer - I do not understand how this movie received so many 5 star reviews. It was boring, typical heavy-handed Tyler Perry mush with a totally unbelievable storyline. Gabrielle Union was wasted in this film, and Thandie Newton must be desperate. And Tyler Perry needs to leave the acting to Madea. The only saving grace for this movie was Phylicia Rashad, and she looked like she'd rather be somewhere else. I am glad I rented the DVD from Redbox instead of wasting my money in the theater."
3,Sweet movie,"This is a sweet movie,but it was pretty predictable. You can see where it is going from the beginning. Not Tyler's best movie, but nice to see him in different roles."
4,Good Job For Good Deeds,"The storyline was fairly predictable with a few surprises along the way, but I sometimes a enjoy a movie that addresses self discovery, heartache, hard times and coming through with a sense of purpose. This would be that film. Tyler Perry was exceptional, proving there's more to him than a wig and a bra. Thandie Newton was, as almost always, a revelation in emotional range. Gabrielle Union also showed her chops and dug into her character with honesty and, in the end, joy. It left me wondering - how did Mr. Deeds' life work out and did his brother ever challenge his personal demons. A great movie all around and one I will watch again."
5,A rockin' electric techno album,"After hearing Pills live last November in France, hard techno took a new meaning. Electrocaine is an explosive album, with Pills taking the risks fit only for the rave type atmosphere. Not to be compared with to the softer techno often heard in the US, Electrocaine is an essential album for any hard techo listerner."
2,HOW LONG ARE THESE SHEARS?,"I don't own this product, but I may buy it if I can find out how big these shears are. Amazon was given the measurements for these shears by the manuafacturer. They list the length as 4.2 inches. That is some small chicken scissors more suited to cutting up little marshmallow Easter candy chicks than real baking chickens. Amazon can not measure the length of the things for me, and the manufacturer (apparently in Italy) has not responded to my email to them. If you are an owner of these shears, your assistance will be greatly appreciated. How long are these shears? Most of the good ones measure about 9 inches long."
2,Holey disorganization!,"This book goes WAY WAY WAY far away from standard VB books. Instead of step by step with examples it seems to kind of overview, and sort of give instructions. It's just very hard to go through. It's not meant for a walkthrough because of how odd it is going through it, its also not meant as a reference because everything is located everywhere."
3,"Decent, but TX6U is better","This is a decent sensor and I like the display on it. However, the display works only in Fahrenheit (no Celsius option). Also, the range does not seem to be as good as my TX6U unit. (I'm guessing the power had to be reduced to allow operation with AAA batteries instead of AA). Also this unit died after two years of use, whereas my TX6U is still going strong after 4 years of use. Obviously, this is not a statistically meaningful sample, your mileage may vary.In retrospect I rarely use the display (and then I have to convert the temperature to Celsius to use it), so it is probably not worth having that feature for me. It probably also makes the unit more failure prone. I'm replacing my failed unit with a TX6U."
2,Good to play with kids,"As most other reviewers said, this game isn't really that well done. I find it rather boring. But I have to say that I am playing it with my 10 year old and she is enjoying it. She and I take turns reading the cheesy dialogue aloud. So I think it has a slight redeeming quality in that it can be fun to play with a child."
2,Not ideal of everyday use,"We were hoping to use this oven as our toaster as well. But since it is quite big, it takes awfully long to toast a couple of slices of bread. You definitely need a real toaster along with this oven.And the clock got busted after only 1 week of use. The time runs faster. Which is not just annoying, it messes up your cooking times!"
3,Why was this listed as MADE IN USA?,"I bought this based on two main assumptions. 1. That all of the reviews I read were accurate, so far they are right and2. THAT IT WAS MADE IN THE USA! ..............NOT!!!! When I put in a search ""toaster ovens made in USA"" this is what came up first. I searched for the USA label on the ad, but could not find it. IT WAS MADE IN CHINA. STUFF FROM CHINA IS NOT ONLY CRAP, BUT IT IS PUTTING AMERICANS OUT OF WORK. When will Americans wake up and realize that this is all a smoke screen. the extreme wealthy do not want to part with money, so, instead of making their products less expensive, and paying workers a little more, they give us crap from China and everyone is happy to get a toaster for $5! NOT ME. This was all done with both the Democrats and Republicans full knowledge.SO - if you are hungry - EAT YOUR CHINESE TOASTER OVEN!"
1,Dead in 6 months (made in China),"It made good toast, but was slow (over five minutes for medium). After six months of light use, the bottom burners completely stopped working. The model 6058 felt solid and looked nice. It's a real shame the electronics are shoddy.The price is low enough that having it repaired feels silly, but high enough I feel robbed by the short life. I decided it must be an oddball lemon, and bought another Oster (different model) and it was a complete pile of junk (I'll review the model 6078 separately). I had mistakenly thought Oster was made in the USA or Canada, but printed on the back: ""MADE IN CHINA"". This explains a lot.One last complaint: We burned ourselves repeatedly on this thing. There are design clues that lead a body to incorrectly think ""cool to the touch"", but instead bring blisters."
1,Junk,"We had an older Oster toaster over (3-5 years old) and while heating leftovers up on a Sat afternoon the heating element had moved, touched the glass, and caused the glass to shatter ALL over the kitchen....while our children were sitting at the island! It was definitely not a good situation. I called Oster to inform them of the problem. Even though the toaster oven was several years old they replaced it free of charge with a newer model...the one from this review. Now, less than 6 months later, the front door doesn't close all the way (it literally gets stuck so we have to put a canister in front of it to keep the door held up). To add to this, a rubber piece broke off and they will not repair or replace the toaster b/c it is past the warranty. So in my opinion, not only is the toaster junk BUT I will never purchase another Oster product again....one explodes across the kitchen and w/i 6 months (4-5 I think, but I don't want to stretch it) the new one doesn't function properly...junk."
4,Improving the Toast Situation,"I like hearty whole wheat bread (Great Harvest variety) toasted until it is obviously browner. Most of the time the bread I toast is frozen. So, the toast cycle on this oven doesn't work very well for me.However, the pizza cycle is 400 degrees and the time can be changed between 0 and 20 minutes. So I use the pizza cycle at 10 minutes for toast the way I like it. I realize this isn't a perfect solution for everyone, but it is a way to get around the frustration of not getting dark enough toast on the toast cycle."
1,Gotta be kidding!,"This tablet brings to your graphics toolbox the advantage that only a jumpy, intermittent and unpredictable cursor can provide.Once you bring bring this impressivley sized resource to bear on any one of your projects, ambitious or just doodling, you'll quickly be thinking to yourself ""I sure hope I didnt buy this on eBay so I can get a refund without being stiffed on the overinflated shipping charges shysters who sell there, charge.""When asked, via email, the question ""Hey what gives with the spastic cursor? How am I supposed to use this product of yours for anything other than another junk drawer asset?"" they couldnt fail to respond fast enough.Could it just be me and my system? Apparently not. Google: cursor problem ""Aiptek HyperPen 12000U ""and see for yourself!"
1,Beware!,"Jason Webster does not know or understand flamenco. This book purports to be a memoir, but it more nearly resembles a fictional account that plays fast and loose with with the facts. The author's knowledge of the history of flamenco and facts about contemporary flamenco is very incomplete and more often than not inaccurate, yet he presents himself as an authority on flamenco. All the professional flamencos I know who have read this book have died laughing at the numerous mistakes and misunderstandings found on each page. This book fails on all counts--it is not a reliable source for information about flamenco and it is so poorly written that I wonder if the author wrote it for a freshman creative writing class. Avoid this book at all costs!"
5,Very Good Read!!,"In the prologue, a mother and her two foster children have been brutally murdered.Fifteen months later, when Karl Dahl, the prime suspect in the murder, comes up for trial, Judge Carey Moore announces that his prior bad acts will not be entered into testimony.The announcement makes her unpopular with the prosecuting attorney, a detective and practically the entire town.Later the same day, while walking through the parking lot to her car, she is assaulted. If she hadn't activated the alarm on her car she would have been beaten to death.The search is on to find her assailant and things heat up for the police when Dahl escapes from prison.Not for the faint of heart, this well-written police story, with strong language and violence, will keep you entertained to the end."
5,Excellent read !,"I picked this book up in the doctors office when someone left it behind. I had never read a book by Tami Hoag and decided to take a look. From the first page I was hooked ! The characters became old friends and I couldn't put the book down. Interesting plot twists and turns make this an interesting mystery. Guessing ""whodunit"" was impossible until the end. I highly recommend this book."
4,One of their best,"When John Lawton took over after original vocalist David Byron (R.I.P.), Uriah Heep's material became much more even, and most of the early rattling and noisy tunes became just a painful memory. On ""FALLEN ANGEL"" (1978), there's a certain touch of gospel in many of the songs but don't let that scare you away because Uriah Heep manage to keep the rock feeling all along the way through the album. The great John Lawton stayed with Heep for only three albums (""FIREFLY"" 1977, ""INNOCENT VICTIM"" 1978, and ""FALLEN ANGEL"" 1978), and I dare to say that this period was the peak in Uriah Heep's career.This album includes great (but unknown?) tracks like ""Woman of the night"", ""Falling in love"", ""One more night"", ""Love or nothing"", and ""I'm alive"". I can highly recommend this album to anyone who like hard rock with great vocals and high quality song writing from the 1970's."
1,Why would you pay this much!?,"This game seems like an awesome game and I am very interested to play it but there's no way I'm paying what is now the used price of 70-something dollars for it, let alone the MINIMUM new price of 140$. It's just not going to happen. I understand that the authors of the game must have done a ton of work to get this game to work out just right and I have no doubt they spent a lot of time on it but this is just way more expensive than it needs to be. There's no way it could cost more than any other book costs to publish."
4,Not as big as I thought,Had I know it was one of those tiny little boxes that you can get at the book store I never would have paid that much on Amazon. But it's a fun game that I can't wait to try out with my husband.
3,The price was cheap enough..,"I really only liked the boxing workout. I have his other workouts, but this is one I use for lighter days. Killer Butt was pretty boring, although challenging. I have plenty of other lower body workouts with more excitement factor for me. I found the yoga boring as well, entirely to repetitive and his voice just didn't sit well with me. I didn't find him relaxing or soothing. I liked Petra's workout, but this is not one of her best works. The moves were way to simple and repetitive and that made it less exciting for me."
1,don't bother - I bought 2 and threw them out.,doesnt serve any purpose - in fact may cause you to drop the camera more often.
3,Sacred Treasures IV,This CD was disappointing. Number I in this series is my favorite. I wouldn't have bought this one if I could have sampled the selections before purchase.
4,I LOVE THIS GUY!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Howard Luedtke is great, I love this guy I'm very picky when it comes to blues When I heard this I was Like wow! what can I say The man rocks. You need to check this out you will not be disapointed , He totally takes it to town with this CD. WOW"
5,The Star and the Sword,"The reading level of this book is approximately 3rd - 5th grade, however, we read it aloud as a family and all ages (7-52) enjoyed it very much."
3,Such potential...,"Well, I just purchased this book through Amazon, and after it arrived, I devoured it in one evening and the following morning (a total of about 3-4 hours). I really enjoyed how the book was going right up till the last 3 pages when, as an earlier reviewer put it, ""the book jumped sixteen years to an unsatisfying end"". Now, the authors did put in the ending the possibility of a sequel which, if done right, could then salvage this book, but until then, I have to give this book 3 stars, of which 1 and 1/2 of them are only because the first 166 pages of this 169 page book were SO good."
3,Works well but sounds like a jet.,"It works very well and I have noticed a huge improvement in air quality as well as reduced dust. However as some of the other reviewers mentioned this thing is loud. I live 80 feet from 12 lanes of I-5, this air cleaner drowns out the freeway noise (somewhat on low settings but when I turn this jet on high I doubt I would hear a semi crashing through my BRICK wall) - which i consider to be positive but for those of you who live in a quite area you might want find a quiter model. For the money it works well."
3,Still analyzing,My hope for this item was two fold. I wanted to reduce my chronic allergies and to reduce the ammount of year round dust that plages my bedroom.I do believe the allergies are better. The dust however seems unchanged. How this is possible I dont know. As for the sound.. .it is true that on high speed one cannot really call it quiet. It is a simple matter of physics that when moving air in such a way it cannot be silent. I keep mine on low and the white noise it provides is perfectly acceptable. The item is somewhat large. On me it is nearly knee high and probalby 18 inches wide.
5,Read this book before you do any Feng Shui Changes,"I find that Karen's techniques alone will cause many positive changes in the energy in your house, and combined with traditional Feng Shui cures they can really help improve your life. A great book!"
2,Lost Me,"I thought the book was very good in the area of clearing clutter, but the space cleaning lost me. I thought it was a little far fetched and reading it was on the boring side. I really liked her first book ""Clearing Clutter"" and was hoping this was an extension of that. I thought some parts were spiritual, but never once was God or a Higher Power mentioned as part of these miracles that happen in our homes."
5,Waiting for Peace: How Israelis Live with Terrorism,WFP is not an easy read but one that evokes strong emotions. Reading the stories of terror survivors and their families fills me with awe at their strength and faith. These people and families are not so different from you and me and yet the unthinkable has happened to them. Some how they carry on with courage and it inspires me.
1,Misleading product listing,"The book listing as ""Débuts with Bind-in Passcode"" was inaccurate. The passcode is actually on a separate card and was missing when the book was delivered (which was very disappointing). You can purchase the passcode separately using information that is in the book, but it costs an additional $75 to buy the passcode for both volumes of the online workbook. I wound up buying the book new from the University Bookstore. It really did include the passcode which provides access to both volumes of the online workbook, so it was considerably less expensive overall than buying the book from Amazon. If the book doesn't really include the passcode, the listing should say so."
5,"Concise, complete chronology of the B24 with great photos.","Anyone interseted in the history and use of the Consolidated B-24 Liberator during WWII will find this book a great reference guide. It is well written. Organized in chornological sequence documenting the B-24 from pre-war design and manufacturing through the life span of the plane, this book includes descriptions of modifcations and design enhancements implemented during the war. The B-24's use as a strategic and combat weapon is vividly described. The photos are outstanding. This large, 60 page paperback will appeal to readers of all ages."
2,"WRITE A BEAUTIFUL STORY, AND LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER.","As much of a misnomer as ""Creative"" is in ad agencies, this book is just a sad example of the exact opposite.Main premise: like knights looking for the Holy Grail, you need the magic of enduring storytelling to seep into your branding efforts. A magic that comes from writers and ""creative people"" instead of ""corporate managers"" and ""surely not non-creative people"".Shallow. Self-indulgent. Hackneyed. Sorry for not even attempting to be creative in lamenting about this tragic excuse of a book, but that's only because it is not worth it."
1,Diesel Designation Missing,"Two issues:1. Your parts selections show 1998 Dodge 2500 trucks but allow no distinction between gasoline and diesel models on the parts, specifically brake rotors and the steering pump.2. There is no link that I can find on your web that allows a specific question about a part. Only a review of the part is allowed which is what I am using here, but I am not reviewing the part/s but the means to ask questions about parts. Thank you.David"
4,Early offering that delivers a solid album,"This album has a few ballads with tender vocals, but the soft sound is destroyed when ""son of a bitch"" comes crashing out of the speakers. No one can deny that Accept is Master of Metal, and here it is in never wear out CD proof. This disc is full of foul language, sexual overtones, violence, anti-society, pain, and suffering. It's degrading to woman, anti-establishment, and harsh. In short, everything you waould expect from a 80's heavy Metal album. I recommend it!"
5,Gentle inspiration,"This is my favorite book. Its filled with simple gentle ideas of what prayer is and how to pray. Its also filled with amusing and touching illustrations of an elf showing the different concepts the book is teaching. I pick this up all the time, when I need to refocus and get my perspective back. It really soothes my spirit. Highly recommended!"
3,not the best on the topic,There are many more enlightened and interesting books on this subject. I study this topic and would use my option for catch and release here if I had one.
4,One Of The Best,"After searching all the record stores for this album, I finally found it and it is worth the wait and search. If you are a fan of real hard core punk music then you will love this album. With the fast beats and the awesome power chords, this album will have you head banging the whole way through. I recommand this album to anyone looking for a good time."
2,Average,Bought this for my kids; yet they still have trouble getting through the game using this book..
4,cute and handy,Love this camera case! You can take it off and use it without the big neck string or wear it around you neck when you're out and about. The only thing is when you walk with it around your neck it kind of swings around quite a bit but what can you do???
1,What a pain,"Cursor doesn't always move when I move the mouse. Cursor sometimes zips across the screen with little or no movement of the mouse. Sometimes the left click stops working. This happens even when my batteries are fully charged (and they're charged individually, not in pairs, so they're both fully charged). My guess is radio interference, but don't really know. Whatever it is, I'm heading out today to buy another mouse. I've had it with this one. :("
5,NMS Review for USMLE Step 2,"Had no difficulty at all installing the CD. Although the software interface is slightly different than the real USMLE, the questions' style and content were right on the money. Like the real test, it allows you to mark and review questions. You can take whole exams or focused exams (e.g., OB/Gyn, Peds, Surg, etc.) in the areas where you need help. The biggest help was the computer timer ticking down just like the real exam -- nice to get used to this."
3,it was okay..,"for a b list movie it was quite good.. luke perry is still as cute as he was in his 90210 days... brought it for the simple fact it had francis capra in it, but other than that it was okay.. funny in some parts.."
1,missing parts,Missing one of the nozzles. Only came with one sprayer.Hopefully the company will fix this or i will nit be buying again or recomending to others.
3,Decent but incomplete.,"Decent quality, no instructions. Really should come with a T fitting as well which I had to purchase separately and delayed repair."
1,I have a hard time even giving this a 1 star rating,"The usb does not work. I purchased 3 of these over 3 weeks ago and have emailed their tech support multiple times and called the number that they email back as an autoresponder which says they cant answer emails. When you call the number, the voice mail box is full. This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I am returning all 3 frames today. There is no way to load pictures into the internal memory except one by one after entering an sd card. And the interface to do so is awful. I highly recommend not purchasing this frame"
4,Pandigital frame,"Frame is well made, and easy to use. The color rendition is very good. The slide show options give you a variety of choices for moving from photo to photo. Plus you can vary the speed at which the slide show changes photos.The pictures load a bit slow from a Memory Stick Duo memory card.The menu loads a bit slow too from the remote, but the remote allows you to control all features of the digital frame.Overall, a very good buy."
1,Very frustrating!,"I am tech trouble shooter for the company I am employed. Yet, for some unexplicable reason, I am unable to get the frame to recognize any of the PC's I have attempted to download through using the USB connection. Additionally, I can not get the frame to read either of my cameras or the camera cards."
1,Embarrassing Piece of Junk,"My husband recieved this as a retirement gift and it NEVER worked. Right out of the unopened box it wouldn't even turn on, let alone function in set up mode! And he was too embarrassed to disappoint the group by saying it was broken, so it will just go in the trash I suppose. I have no idea how much they paid for it, but I WON'T be getting a replacement from PANDIGITAL--that is a certainty."
1,"USB Does Not Work, 1 Dead Pixel","This unit hangs or crashes upon any USB connection to either my Linux or Windows ME PC. (These are USB 1 PCs.) Both my PCs work fine with other thumb drives and CF/SD card readers, so it's the frame that's not acting right. There is one bright blue dead pixel near the center of the display. Documentation is very sparse. Limited facility for rotating images once they are in the device.The display is bright and contrasty, good edge to edge brightness, and works fine when I just put a CF card in. I'd return it if I had bought it myself but it was a gift - perfect for regifting to a relative that doesn't have a PC. You can just mail them CF cards to plug in."
1,Video playback not working,"The frame plays pictures great but the video in not working. I've tried all the formats that pandigital lists are compatible and none work. Called tech support and still waiting for a return call.Also, it appears that the frame will only automatically play photos OR video. NOT BOTH at the same time. The user must physically switch from one to the other. It would be nice to be able to press play and the device would automatically play both photos and video without any user interaction."
1,Unusable product,"Bought this frame today and took it out of the box to put it through its paces. Nothing worked. The USB device is not recognized. Gave up on that, tried loading photos from a CF card. It refused to recognize the format. Okay, I reformatted the card in Windows, still didn't recognize the card. Then I resized all my photos because it didn't recognize the .jpg format, but even that didn't help. I give up, not one thing that I tried worked. Just about the worst product I have ever seen. Glad I didn't bother with the nonexistent ""customer service"" as some other poor people have. This is going back to the store tomorrow. Wish I could give this product -0 star since it costs me gas to return it."
1,Works intermittently,"I bought this product from a large warehouse store. All connections worked fine, but after a while it started to lose images in the onboard memory. I didn't notice until some started displaying with corrupt data (weird lines through images). I plugged the USB in again to download the images again and I received an unformatted drive warning. I had to reformat the onboard (FAT32) and re-downlaod all the images. I turned it off for several weeks while I was on vacation. When I got back, it had lost all the data in the onboard memory and I had to reformat and redownload again. I'm going to take the product back where I bought it. There's definitely a problem with the firmware on this product or just poor QA at the factory."
2,Fell Short of Expectations,"There are many things to like about this deep fryer, especially the ease with which the grease is drained from the fryer. I could have lived without a timer, and could have lived without a temperature control, but I just can't live with its inability to heat the grease past 340. I checked the temperature with 3 different thermometers, all of which said the same thing. The highest temperature it was able to reach was 345, when most fried foods require a temperature of 375. I tried letting it heat for nearly 30 minutes, and tried stirring the grease - but was unable to get the temperature up to even 350. I tried twice to cook fish and french fries. The french fries almost burned before they got crisp, and the fish had to cook longer than usual in order to get it crispy. I supposed this unit could have been defective, but I'm not taking a chance with a replacement - I'll just get another model/brand, and, alas (I hate to return stuff), this one is going back."
3,Read the fine print...,"1.""Designed and engineered in Italy.""BUT ""Made in China"" It says ""Made in PRC"" on the label. PRC = People's Republic of China.2.There is no temperature control.3.The short magnetic AC cord/plug doesn't attach securely.4.Target sells this for $50 which is $10 less."
1,DeLonghi is not anymore as before,"Comparing with the previous model DeLonghi, which is discontinued, I am extremely unsatisfied with this one. It doesn't have a timer - you have to stay next to the fryer and watch it constantly in order not to burn the potatoes; the power cord comes off often because is not build in; after using the fryer 2-3 times, the outside plastic takes different, deformed shape. The whole fryer is made worse."
4,This game is SUPER phat!,"The graphics were rockin, the game play sensational- the pitchin spectacular- a little too easy to go yard on your buddies, though."
3,HAS NO ILLUSTRATIONS!,"As of today there are 5 Kindle versions of this book for sale on Amazon. I bought 3 of them, and none of the 3 I bought included the illustrations. Still a great read, but the original version of this book has interesting drawings and photos. Too bad, I would have loved to have the complete book on my Kindle."
1,HP Compaq X GX5050,"I was most disappointed with this item and returned it for a refund. The unit arrived in what appeared to be good condition, but when I set it up it did not have video. I tried two different monitors but still nothing. I called HP Compaq tech support but they were no help. They tried to tell me that I had no warranty and that the problem was with my monitor. I felt that I had no choice but to seek a refund and will never buy one of their products again. I do appreciate Amazon.com's policy of customer satisfaction and am grateful for their help in resolving this issue. I received a full refund including shipping. I would not let this incident stop me from buying from them again."
2,"It's about infertility, not romance","I found the premise of the book disturbing. In a sense, that was the point, but I found it more disturbing, I think, than the author herself did, which alienated me somewhat from the heroine. She was completely consumed with the need to have a baby. Her sister finds herself with an unwanted pregnancy and gives the baby to her; but she finds herself obsessed with the idea that her sister and husband have had the baby together. This didn't seem reasonable to me at all. With the heroine's hormone fluctuations, you would have thought that she was already pregnant. There was no romance in this book. The heroine's husband was boorish, and she was a sad sack. I want to read better books than this, and hope this author will try harder next time."
1,NewvoBeauty switched this item for a less expensive model,"Beware when ordering this item--the red dryer with a 50 month warranty. After ordering this model twice, I was sent one that has a 24 month warranty, worth quite a bit less and a completely different model. The only thing similar was that both were red and made by the same company."
5,Works fine so far,Got it and us it in key board. This one is cheap and works fine. YOU want it definitely. Go get it!
2,Sony Batteries,I did not order AAA batteries. I ordered AA batteries and received AAA batteries.I never did receive AA batteries that I ordered. End of story
1,BIG LET-DOWN,"I purchased this CD based on previous Hed Kandi releases and the other reviews. This release didn't chill me out, it got me angrier and angrier with each unimaginative, annoying, and cheesy track. This is bad pop music at best. Not electronica chillout AT ALL. Every track is exactly the same, with the same uninspiring female vocal in EVERY SONG. And the vocals aren't even soothing, at points as aggravating as a pack of rangy alleycats in heat. And a remake of oran' juice jones's 'I saw you walking in the rain'? Give me a break. So if you are into an ... 2CD collection of a bad carpenters' cover band, this is for you. I would recommend instead Serve Chilled 1 or Cafe del Mar volumen cinco if you are after good chill-out music."
4,A worthy addition to the winter chill canon.,"Of the plethora of chillout compilations available today, Hed Kandi's Winter Chill collection stands out. Characterized by chillingly fantastic grooves, powerful beats and sultry female vocals, Winter Chill 3 is at least as good as its predecessors.Sets a great mood for hanging out at home, driving, coming down for a long night of partying, or the bedroom. Standouts on this collection are the phenomenal ""Evergreen"" from Faithless, Lamb's beautiful ""Gabriel"", and Natural Calamity's silky-smooth ""And That's Saying A Lot"".What I like best about these collections is the fact that the CD's offer a wide array of music that you normally won't find anywhere else. Most of these artists you've probably never heard before, and that's unbelieveable considering the quality of the tracks. Highly recommended, especially for those that are fans of the Cafe Del Mar series."
5,Faces of Adoption,"I totally recommend this book! The pictures are lovely, and the text is excellent (best for ages 6 and up, although can be para-phrased for those younger). The pictures put clear images into my mind's eye, images that had been absent prior to reading this book. Further, seeing the orphanges and the caretakers, not to mention the beautiful children, have allowed me to visualize more clearly where my daughter will soon come from.I highly recommend this book to all, whether in the process of adopting, having already adopted or simply interested in a good, hearwarming read. You won't be disappointed!"
4,"Good, but too complicated for small children","This is a very good book and I recommend it for anyone adopting from Vietnam. We will be adopting our baby in a few months and it reflects everything we have learned about our process so far. Also, if for no other reason, buy this book for the beautiful photographs.BUT, and this is a big BUT, this book is not something you can sit down and read a toddler or even have a first or second grade student read through. It's fairly long (44 pages) and has complicated enough words that I would guess it's at a third or fourth grade reading level. Believe it or not, this book was actually best suited for educating our relatives unfamiliar with how Vietnamese adoptions work. I would love to see the authors write a related book (with fewer pages and simpler words) that I can read to my child when he/she will be at pre-school level."
5,My vietnamese born children love this,"Both of my adopted children came to me from Vietnam at 6 months old from orphanages. They are 6 now and love this book. It has really helped them understand why they live with me and not their moms and has opened up a door to discussion I never dreamed possible at this age. The pictures are wonderful, the difficult topics handled gracefully and makes me cry everytime we read it."
5,Amazing narrator and characters,"Not only is this book narrated by a very grim, insightful, and often sarcastically funny Death, but it's full of unforgetable characters you can't help but love. Liesel is an innocent German girl living through the horrors of Nazi Germany. She loses the little family she has, gets sent to live with strangers, and becomes best friends with the Jew hiding in the basement. The story is amazing from page 1!"
5,AMAZING READ--ONE OF BEST BOOKS EVER!,"Narrated by Death, this is story of Liesel Meminger, a nine-year-old foster girl growing up midst World War II in Nazi Germany. Liesel soon discovers something she can't resist- books. Soon Liesel begins stealing books from Nazi book-burnings. With the help of her accordion-player foster father, Liesel learns to read. Liesel shares her stolen books with neighbors during bombing raids, and along with the Jewish man hidden in her basement.This is the story of a girl in Nazi Germany and what books are able to make people believe and do.550 pages. This book is highly recommended for people who enjoy historical fiction. Ages 11 +."
5,THIS story will feed your soul....,"To say that Markus Zusak is a brilliant 32 year old up and coming author would be the understatement of all understatements! Talk about an ""unforgettable story about the ability of books to feed the soul""!! He presented this story from the eyes of 'death himself' and told us about the extremes in human behavior as never been told before. I stayed up all night to finish this book and cannot stop thinking about it. It definitely rates as one of the best books I've ever read! Bravo, Mr. Zusak!!"
5,Great book for adults,"I found this book interesting and well written. Haunting, really. I made my book club read it. I had a bit of trouble convincing my daughter to read it though, so I'm not sure that younger readers will appreciate it, but older teens and adults will find it memorable."
1,A very strange book,"This was a book we read in a book club, otherwise, I would not have finished the book. It had a good story line, but found the writing to be very strange. Not my type of book."
2,Meh.,"I guess I'm one of those people who just doesn't see why this is a 4 or 5 star book. It feels like the author over-reached his abilities. The Death narrator didn't work for me, it felt like Zusak was trying for Vonnegut's ironic narrative without Vonnegut's talent. The title also was problematic as the thievery didn't feel integral to the story.Lastly, the characters were mostly caricatures and felt like stereotypes we've seen before. They lacked backstory or explanations for their behavior that would have made them more credible.This is one of the few books I actually skipped about 40 pages towards the end just to finish."
4,Excellent,"Very thought provoking, a true page turner. Would highly recommend to others. I loved the development of characters and scenery. A fabulous read!"
1,Very sophisticated prose and symbolism,"Unless your teen has good knowledge of what happened in Germany during World War II, an exceptional vocabulary and the ability to read flowery and vague symbolic passages (many) and make sense of them, it will be a tough read. The book is fine if you're reading it with them, but if they're reading it independently they will be quite frustrated and only get about 70% of what's going on. Knowledge of communism, Nazi philosophy, what happened in concentration camps (specifically), and why Germany would have been bombed by someone (the book never says who is bombing) are essential. The end of the book leaves too many unanswered questions - it's as if the author thought 550 pages was enough and didn't finish his story lines well at all."
5,"A very interesting, fast read.","It is a unique, cleverly written story that keeps the reader's attention from the first page. I enjoyed it thoroughly!"
5,you have got to read this!,If you like quick reads. This book.is not for you. What i loved so much about this book are getting to know the characters and how they grow on you. The ending of a book never made me emotional like this one. Its an amazing read narrated by death which makes this book so different from the rest. Without a doubt the best book i've ever read!
5,"Raw, powerful truth","This was an amazing read. It nuances the ""the cost"" that the children of the non-jewish residents paid for witnessing their government and often their families collaborating in the atrocities against the Jews. It explores the pain and also the quiet heroism that some of the most vulnerable paid in taking a stand against their government's terrible injustice. It is a story of how the youngest among us can witness how to be brave, authentic and survive with their humanity intact. Well written, no sentimentalism, just raw powerful truth."
3,Strange writing style,"I did not finish this book, not even close. I just couldn't get into it. HOWEVER, my book club LOVED it. My advice would be to try the sample before purchasing."
5,Very interesting,I greatly enjoyed reading this book.It is very interesting and keeps you engaged in the story especially for people who like to read about WWII.
5,Epic,"Excellent book and highly recommended. I am a male in my thirties and I've heard this book was written for a younger audience. Despite this, I found the book to resonate deeply on both an emotional and intellectual level. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of creative, compelling writing, that isn't afraid to play with your heart strings."
5,I cannot praise this book enough...,"I am always searching for a book that gives you that magical feeling that you never want to end. This is one of those books. It immediately goes to the top of the list of books that I recommend to friends and family. The lyrical qualities of the writing are just beautiful, the story..heartbreaking, and the characters...unforgettable. Please read this book. You'll think about it for weeks after finishing it."
5,worth the read,"I dont uaually write reviews but this book surprised me. It started off a little odd and slow, i wasnt sure if I was going to finish it. Boy am I glad I did. It has become one of the best books I have ever read. It has stayed with me for quite some time now after reading it. Thinking back on some of the scenes and quotes presented in the book quite frankly warm my heart and fill my soul. The book Thief was well worth the read!"
5,Riviting and Emotionally engaging,"I haven't been so emotionally engaged in a book in I can't remember how long. The only fault that I find is that reviews keep saying that the target audience for this book is teens! While I find the story and the historic significance important, I would argue that the reader who gets more out of this book is a reader who has experienced more out of life. I loved all of the figurative language and the perspective that Zusak wrote from. And although I was a bit annoyed that Death was a blabber-mouth, in the end it didn't take away from how I felt reading the last 80 pages of the book. This book was our community book for 2007 (a grant provides them at no cost to anyone who wants to read one). Everyone I've talked to has literally sobbed through the ending, feeling everything that Liesel does along the way.Phenomenal. I recommend it to everyone."
2,didn't bother to finish,I went in to the book knowing it was a YA novel. Enjoyed reading the first half then just didn't care enough to finish it!Read some reviews of the ending and was glad I didn't waste anymore time on it.
2,not as good as everyone says,"I did not love this book. I started it years ago and put it down. I found it hard to get into. Then enough people have told me how much they enjoyed it that I gave it another shot and really forced myself to read it. NOT WORTH IT. By the end I was skimming. I found it quite slow except for a few moments in the book. It was only after discussing with someone again that they agreed that some people love it and others, not so much. My recommendation is if you don't love it after reading the sample, don't bother. The rest is just more of the same."
5,a must-read,"The Book Thief is one of the most important books of this generation. Zusak's poetic, insightful storytelling draws the reader into the narrative and doesn't let him go until the end. Recommended to anyone age ten and up."
1,Completely overrated.,"I found this book boring and basically uninteresting. I had to read it for a teen book group and I struggled to get through it. I don't know why all the hype -- I have read many novels and many nonfiction books on the Holocaust that were much better than this one. I did not like the narrator ""Death"" nor its point of view observing the action and remarking upon it.Apparently I'm out on a limb as a lone dissenter on this forum, but I'm a school librarian at a high school and the kids in my book group didn't rank it highly either. They preferred other titles such as Sarah's Key, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, The Upstairs Room, I Will Plant You a Lilac Tree, Skeletons at the Feast, and The Final Journey -- to name a few."
1,Not so happy :o),"I've ordered used books on many occasions from amazon before. This book was really used! It took so long for it to arrive. I kept checking on the status of it - kept saying ""shipped"". By the time I got the book, I had to hurry to read it in time for my Book Club. I don't think I would recommend this vendor to others."
1,Slooooooooooooow!,"I got to page 267 after two months. I am usually a fast reader, but this made me fall asleep every time I started reading. Good story, but boring! I would compare it to ""running in sand!"" One does advance, but with tremendous effort.Too bad, I usually like stories from WWII."
4,perspective,Interesting perspective of the war from a German civilian point. The innocence of a child and how infectious love is.
5,One of the best books I have ever read,"As an avid reader, this book will go down as one of the best I have read. It is absolutely beautifully written, sad and absolutely memorable. I could not put it down and recommend it to all who love to read."
5,Can't Put it Down,From the first sentence I was hooked. An emotional ride with many unexpected twists.Abish - Daughter of God
4,School Book,"Bought it for my son's 8th grade reading, I don't really know if it is a good read. He wasn't thrilled with it."
5,A damn good book..damn good,Anyone who enjoys reading should read this story. I'm not a reviewer. I'm not a writer. I'm a reader recomending a story that moved me so whatever your age add it to your collection.
4,Truly a must read...,"I loved this book. Why? I am not sure. I think it was because it gave me a perspective on life that I never really thought of. I am in my early twenties and this book really made me think about my life and how good I have it. I really don't know what it means to be poor, to be afraid to go outside and live my religion. I think everyone takes life for granted and this book took me a long time to read. I didn't want to read it fast just to finish it. I wanted to savor every page, so that I was able to truly understand what it means. This is a good book, but it is sad.I honestly wouldn't recommend this book unless you are over 16 though. You might not truly understand what is going on or appreciate the book."
1,Hate it...,"I'm trying to work my way through to finish this book, but it is doubtful. I hate the disjointed writing style. Author takes forever to get to the point. I wouldn't have picked up on the point that it is being told from the point of view of the ""grim reaper"" if I hadn't read the reviews, the author doesn't just spell it out. All the vague, poetic inserts are just annoying. I can't see any ""young adult"" wanting to be bothered with this...but I honestly feel there is a good story underlying the poor writing method and that's what will make me finish it on principal I suppose."
3,A topsey turvey journey!,"I bought this book because of all the ""I loved it coos"" from colleagues and friends. For me ""The Book Thief"" took me on a bicycle ride. The start an easy and enjoyable coast into the set up of setting and characters. The middle hit an unexpected and hard going incline, at times I thought to myself ""just hurry up and finish"". By the end however I was glad I persisted as zusak ties the end up nicely. However predictable that such oppressed characters and the miserable clime of their times, suggested things would not get better for all involved. The narration by ""death"" himself gave the story an unusual and complex spin."
5,Book Lovers Book,"It seems a bit redundant to write a review for a book that has so many reviews already but that's the point. This is a marvelous book that should be read and the more reviews the more readers it will find. If you love books, this is a book you will love."
4,A page turner,"I have read extensively on the holocaust and I loved this new perspective. Great writing, great plot. I would recommend to anyone."
5,One of the best books i've ever read!,"I have never felt compelled to write a review until now because I feel so strongly about this book. This story is told from such a unique perspective and is so creatively written. There is so much heart and feeling in this book that i was sad for it to come to an end. I will definitely be reading it again and I've been recommending it to everyone, and so far I've gotten nothing but positive feedback.It is a touching story with characters that you will truly fall in love with. Read this book and even if you don't love it as much as I did, you'll still be glad you did :)"
4,a book club review,"Based upon a recommendation I offered The Book Thief as a possible choice for my book club. At the time I did not realize that it was meant for use by younger adults. Well, it sure didn't matter to us.To immediately discover the identity of the narrator was chilling. The characterizations were cleverly done. The language was rich and engulfing. The Book Thief was cleverly written using a variety of styles. It created another picture of the Holocaust; through children's eyes. My only reason not to give it 5 stars was that the ending for me was a bit disappointing. Well worth the read, nonetheless."
2,A teen book??,"Seriously, this book is so long that as an adult I could barely get myself together to slog through it. Now I can see that a large number of people really liked this book, and I had hoped for the same results, but for me it didn't work.I felt the need to write a review (as have some others) so that the 5 stars don't totally overwhelm.The end of the book is better than the beginning and middle, if you can get that far.I wish you luck.MR"
5,Steven Speilburg should make this into a great movie,"Steven Speilburg should turn this book into film. Shoot it like ""A Wonderful Life""; Bedford Falls turns into the small German town, Clarence becomes Morgan Freeman's voice only, and his relationship with our darling book theif would be like Atticus and Scout's... I think it could be a great movie"
5,The Book Theif,"If books are measured by how they, through the power of words, reach into your heart and move you to new discoveries, powerful emotions, and wonderful inspiration, then this book is great. It describes how words and books do this in the characters lives ... all the while doing it to you as you read it. Couldn't put it down and now I'm sad its over, but I'll never forget it.I will recommend this to all."
4,"bold, smart","For the first few pages I was unsure about this book--the tone and writing felt arrogant, but then again, the narrator is Death (who better to be arrogant?). I kept going and was glad I did. This is a very skillfully written story populated with engaging characters. Generally I shy away from children as protagonists, but a child's eye view of the holocaust from a small village is new (to me, at least) and I very much enjoyed this book. I was surprised that the author was a young Australian. He did well by his subject matter."
1,I've had two of these (one a warranty replacement) and both stopped working.,"I couldn't recommend buying this unit. The temperature definitely ran a few degrees hot, but that's not the reason. Both units that I acquired (one was a warranty replacement) quit within a few months with the digital screen locked up. The unit I bought to pair them with also quit working within this time. LaCrosse customer service was a joke, as I had all but given up on getting any response at all after many weeks. I was surprised when someone actually did respond and send me a new unit, but since it failed too, I won't be buying another product from LaCrosse."
1,Dr. Frank's Joint & Muscle Pain Relief,"""Never give a sucker an even break or smarten up a chump!"" -- W. C. FieldsDoesn't it make sense to conduct a little research on products such as Dr. Frank's Joint & Musicle Pain Relief Oral Spray prior to doling out one's hard-earned cash?I find it amusing, but sad, that so many gullilble people fall for the outlandish claims from some sleaze in a lab coat, only to find that they've been hood-winked."
4,A cute little book!,"This book is a cute, fun, quick read. Some parts remind me of the ""older"" humor that circulates through the Internet -- but this is an original. I can almost hear my mother telling me many of these stories."
4,Uplifting and Hopeful,"This author writes a heartwarming and uplifting book once again. She does not ignore the difficulties of old age, the sickness, lonliness and discouragement, but her tales present these very present realities in a hopeful and meaningful setting. Reaching out to others, maintaining a sense of humor and balance, once again well done. Just wish the books were longer, but at 90 years old, they probably seem epic. God Bless her."
2,It works but you cant see,This waterproof case keeps the camera dry and you can submurse it. You just need to be prepared to not have a clue what you are shooting a picture of. You have to aim it in the general direction of the object you want a picture of and hope for the best. I am glad I have it and I am going to try to make something useful out of the shots I took.
1,Don't Buy!,"I think this tea has alot of stevia leaf (natural sweetner) in it which overrides the peach and ginger flavor. When stevia leaf is used sparingly it is fine but when there is alot used, it will have bitter taste to it. If you are looking for a tea that helps with digestion, I highly recommend trying Celestial Seasonings Tummy Mint tea. I rated this 1 star because I love Celestial Seasonings and if you are someone that doesn't mind alternative sweeteners - you may like this tea. I just suggest buying 1 package from your local grocer rather than this 10 count pack."
1,This is a bad Ash.,"Sorry I don't agree with the first reviewer. I am a great fan of W. Ash, but this is a bad one. I may be an honest plain rock album, true, but it does not carry the Ash twin-guitars bluesy banner."
5,Great writer,Enjoy reading Kathryn Shay. Kept me wanting to read more and more. Looking forward to reading more of her books.
3,Good for Beginners,"I exercise everyday and although I'm not an expert when it comes to kick boxing I do have a little experience, and I found this video very easy. The pace was to slow 90% of the time causing my heart rate to stay fairly low. The moves are cool, especially when mixed and the bonus workout has a lot of great stretches. Overall, I'd be great if Patricia didn't talk so much and cut straight to the moves."
2,Didnt get much of a workout,this dvd was differnt when i went into a work out the lady was just talking it wasnt even a workout. The one workout i could get to play wasnt really a good one.
2,Would be great IF....,the DVD would play! I get to see the Introduction and the first section that teaches you the moves. THAT'S IT! By just watching the first portion I could tell this would be a great kickboxing workout. To bad I will never be able to find out!
1,Not for me,"I couldn't get into this workout. It was too weird, and I couldn't get my coordination right or something. Might work great for other people, just not this one!"
2,this book is new?,"Book that I purchased as NEW, damage to spine and cover, yet sold as new? I will never use this company again."
3,"Nice to meet the dragons, but where's the beef?","A couple of the reviews of this book have appropriately mentioned that there is little tension or thwarted expectations in this book. True enough.If you wanted to get a book for a little girl - she could be fifty and could be a he, I'm just characterizing here - who loves dragons, particularly the IDEA of dragons, boy, this'll do it. Not as tight or compelling as some others, but with a classic simplicity that would be very rewarding for some readers."
4,more than enough,"I've had problems with various forms of media writing accessories (mostly with the Memorex brand)... So when it was time for me to buy my first pack of DVD-R disks, I went straight for the Verbatim.I've used this whole pack up with my new DVD-RW drive and I've had absolutely no problems. The image quality is perfect and there have been no mishaps with problematic disks.Overall, highly recommended."
2,Sony Block!!!!!!!!!,"I've run into the Sony Block 2 times so far and it kept me from buyiing this CD. I make a copy to listen to at work and keep the original clean from scratches. This is not very impressive from Sony, so I'll beware before buying anymore from the Sony label!!! Dear Sony, We are not all pirates!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And I haven't even heard this one yet. I love Buddy, but I'm gunshy now! TYVM SONY!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Vitamins hard to understand,"I think over all this book gives a lot of useful information along with recipes that are easy to make with everyday ingredients. My big complaint is the vitamin dosages, they are very hard to figure out. I have a 70# German Shepherd and a 5# Papillon. The charts only go down to 10# with the smallest dose being 1/5 of a vitamin pill, now I would have to halve that. The charts of calorie needs is pretty hard to digest also. You have to be really committed to making your own pet food because although this book has great information some of it is hard to get at. As for being a dry read I don't see a problem with that, after all this is a text book not a novel, so you get more good information because space is not taken up with cute stories and such. I would love to see an updated version of this book being as how it is [...], things change in that length of time and this subject matter needs to be current."
1,Better books Available,"I was disappointed in this book. It uses very few ingredients, and just offers a number of variations on those ingredients. Also there is no explanation of why each ingredient has been chosen, which makes it difficult to substitute when necessary. I have a number of other pet-food books, and most of them are more useful."
2,Too much work for kids (Which means you have to do it),"This toy is a flimsy piece of garbage. It's not at all realistic. You have to put everything together (more pieces than I thought). Then you have to deal with the pain of actually trying to paint each individual planet (some of which are smaller than a dime). Can you imagine having to use water paint (which runs badly) on a small little piece of plastic? Try using more than one color on something that tiny. You end up getting a glob of paint. Also very small parts, not recommended for people under 120 years old!Look for a better model, I certainly will. Cause the one I ordered is already in some landfill somewhere."
5,Best Shooter not based on WWII,DELTA FORCE BLACK HAWK DOWN:pros:gives you a good reason to complete levelsgreat multiplayerlots of weaponscons:no way to save in middle of missionsome dude yells at you if you go off course
1,This Band Sucks...!,"If your a real Metal head or a real Punk Rocker I am telling you... seriouly telling you dont buy this CD is not hard or agrasive as some real Thrash Metal Bands or Heavy Metal bands as Aspid, Necrosis, Slayer, Sepultura, Mastifal... is not fool of real Punk Rock as Electric Frankenstain, The Customers,...is not real rock as the coolest 100% Rock band:Dada... dont buy it or you will insult the real meaning of Rock!"
4,Functional but difficult to install,"No longer do my clothes fall off of the bar, but these were somewhat difficult to install. I bought them for all of my closet rods."
1,Dont fit standard closet bar,"These are too small to anchor inside a standard closet bar, but were too cheap to bother returning. More stuff for the junk drawer."
2,bass is only good for thump thump stuff,"I ended up cutting the wires inside the subwoofer and rerouting them to another subwoofer instead. It's good for games and some music if your the type who likes boom box style sound, but it in no way approaches quality sound. It's comparable to a boss acoustimass system except the bass is worse(flabby and muffled, ie. you can't tell the difference between notes and you can't feel slam from drum beats).All in all not worth the price. My suggestion is spend about $150 for a stereo reciever or something with a built in radio and maybe a remote control, and get some cheap speakers to connect to it. The subwoofer in this thing is only 4"", so nearly any decent bookshelf style speaker will have more bass than the lansings."
3,"Good speakers, bad connector","These are pretty good little speakers, but the custom socket which connects the speakers to the amp/sub is prone to breaking. I've had two units become unusable when this connector went flaky.Yes, it does have to do with me kicking the sub occasionally, but since it is designed to sit on the floor under your desk, that should be taken into account. No excuse for not using a better connector and/or mounting it more securely."
5,Quality speakers at a Great price!!!,"I love these speakers. Not only can I use them for my computer but I can also use them for gaming and portable listening devices. They were so quick and easy to set up. In no time, I was able to listen to CDs on my computer. Watching DVDs on my computer is much better with these speakers. They make it seem like you're right in the action. I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for some nice new speakers!"
1,Where is Arabian Gulf?,"I dont know any . The author should read some history books because the real name is and has always been PERSIAN GULF, with or without arab money"
5,"Phonics I, II, III","I taught from a series of books: Primary Phonics I, II, III.I have lost contact with them and find them hard to find. Without seeing the inside, it is very difficult to know for sure before ordering.As the description of the books suggests, there were line drawings, word colours and a progressive learning sequence which made these books excellent for teaching.However, before I order, I'd like to look at the inside of the book (s).I can be reached at shoulderlane@yahoo.com for further clarification should someone know what the inside looks like."
3,Only OK,"This is an unimaginative, almost mind-numbing approach to the subject. It was boring for both a student and a teacher who are both excited about the subject."
3,It's not THAT bad,"i've read some really negatory reviews of this album on here, but really its not that bad. it does rock and there are some good tull songs. this album is simpler than alot of tull's more ""concept"" heavy recent albums. rock island particularly is damn catchy. i really think you can find albums that are better examples of putrid trash or whatever these yahoos called it. tull rocks your socks."
3,A few strong songs make this one worthwhile,"Not my favorite Tull album by any means but the title track plus Kissing Willie, Ears of Tin and Another Christmas Song are all well done."
1,I would rapturously reccomend ignorring this album.,"This is the lowest point in human history, almost an insult to Creation.Ian Anderson, his friends, and his family, are cancer."
2,Christ and his angels slept,"Like the author, but the Amazon Kindle edition leaves out very important pieces from front of the book. Sharon Penman always includes maps, and dramatis persona in her books. The Amazon Kindle edition does not have it. My advice ... DON'T take the Kindle edition; get a copy from your local library instead ..."
4,Another great hisorical fiction writer!,"This is the first book I've read by Penman and I really enjoyed it. I did get a little dragged down in the middle when I wondered how many back and forth struggles Maude and Steven would go through before the book ended. But, I found myself racing through the last third of the book for the resolution. I also enjoyed reading this book because it takes place after the sinking of the White Ship when Pillars of the Earth (highly recommeded!)takes place- it was so interesting comparing how Maude and Steven were portrayed in both books. Saints Slept of course has more detail about Maude and Steven while Pillars concentrates on the lives of the commoner.I do agree with one reviewer to say all the names were confusing to keep straight! But- that is such a little thing. I can't wait to read Here be Dragons."
1,It's no Pillars of the Earth,"Having trouble sleeping? Then this is the book for you! Do yourselves a favor and read Ken Follet's ""Pillars of the Earth"" instead."
5,A Book with Great Depth,These two pre-Civil War women were way ahead of their time.After reading the book you will feel as if you really know the two sisters. And what a story they had to tell!!It is impressive that their writings survived the times and were shared with others in this great book.
4,Little 90s gem,"This movie was showing on t.v one day and it turned out to be hilarious. I couldn't believe that I'd never seen or heard of it, growing up in the 90s. I enjoyed it so much I bought it on DVD. Lenny Henry is a genius and the movie is so underrated. What more can I say? The story-line is quite original. It's hard to make a film with a black male lead without it becoming cliched. Funnily enough, that's one of the main ideas explored in the movie (Lenny Henry is a stage actor looking for work). It's quirky and interesting and keeps you on your toes. The characters are laugh-out-loud funny- from the various mafia guys to Lenny's nerdy makeup artist side-kick. Lenny's mafia persona and other impersonations he does are hilarious. I'm surprised he didn't do more in Hollywood.Good, fun movie- clean jokes and very invocative of the 90s."
3,Easy but for the distraction,"The trio Tethered Moon's renditions of Kurt Weill songs makes for easy--and in easily enjoyable--listening, except for the persistent low background noise, perhaps from one of the players humming along. Unfortunately, it sounds (in a friend's words), like a baby's anguished wail. The distraction is more prominent on one or two of the tracks than the others, so the disc is not totally lost."
2,Very weird game.,"This game was pretty good, but it's weird. I mean the character use, Willie Wampa Cheeks? Von Clutch? Pasadena O' Possum? psst. And this is 50% an aventure and 50% a racing game, & 100% retarded. This game is too easy as well. This game is good but odd."
1,What happened?,"General public, I am all about making people happier. So I would like to advise you to not buy this game, or any other Crash games not made by Naughty Dog. You know why? Because they're awful.You may wonder ""Why is this game so bad?"" Well, one major element is the characters. Or, the lack of them. Of the games 8 characters (yes, 8) only 4 were created by naughty Dog and have appeared on the PS1. In fact, 2 characters were created just for CTTR.Also, clashing is fun but is pretty much a copy of Mario Kart Double Dash. In fact, that's what this whole game is. So good people, lend me your ears. Don't buy this game. Buy CTR for the PS1."
3,verhrph,Don't order this case if you plan on using the 8-cell battery. It will only hold the X40 with 4-cell battery. 8-cell really strains the zippers - bummer!
1,AWFUL MOVIE & BAD ACTING....(DON'T WASTE UR TIME & MONEY ON DIS CRAP)!!!!,"DIS MOVIE IZ ""1 OF DA WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN"" & DA ACTING IZ ""VERY HORRIBLE"" & ""LAUGHABLE"" & IZ A WASTE OF MONEY & I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND DIS 2 ANYBODY 2 BUY & IF U WANNA SEE A GR8 MICHAEL JACKSON BIOPIC DEN U SHOULD BUY: ""THE JACKSONS: AN AMERICAN DREAM"" ON DVD (ITZ DA BEST BIOPIC ON MICHAEL JACKSON INSTEAD OF DIS CRAP)!!!!"
1,Ugh So bad!!,This movie was so hard to watch. Through the whole thing you find yourself asking if it's a joke? At first I couldn't stop laughing but soon it's just became ridiculous and over the top. Flex Alexander's performance is flat and leaves much more to be desired (definitely not a good portrayal of the King of Pop). I would NOT recommend you wasting your money on this terrible film. If you are looking for something similar that is actually interesting to watch I would recommend The Jackson's: An American Dream.
2,Man in the Mirror,"This was okay, not what I expected. The actor didn't look in my opinon like MJ and he just didn't fit the part. I don't know if I would repeat seeing it or not I guess it just wasn't to my liking. I believe the film could have been made more interesting."
1,Where do I begin?,"I am a HUGE Michael Jackson fan & when I saw this movie, I was beyond pissed! This movie seemed to have a budget of $5! The acting was horrible & the actors looked nothing like the people they were supposed to be protraying. The make-up they put on Flex made him look ashy! Where exactly did the people for this movie get there info from cause there's a few things in this movie that they got wrong! It was all way too over the top & it seemed like it was ripped from the tabloids. This movie was a complete joke & it should have never been made!"
1,WORST MOVIE IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE!!! DON'T BUY IT!!!,THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! NONE OF THE ACTORS CAN ACT AT ALL!!! THEY DIDN'T GET A PERSON WHO LOOKS ANYTHING LIKE MICHAEL JACKSON! THESE PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE PAYED FOR CREATING THIS! YOU WILL BE VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED IF YOU BUY THIS MOVIE!
1,Michael himself doesn't like this movie at all,"This is the worst movie about MJ I've ever seen, I like the The Jacksons - An American Dream (The Complete Miniseries) (1992). But this one-everything looks wired. Just like the other review said:If you are not a MJ fan, you will hate this movie. If you are a normal MJ fan, you will hate this movie. If you are the biggest MJ fan in the world, you will HATE this movie and you even HATE yourself to bought this movie-that is I opened the DVD,I watched it and I can't return it."
4,Where misinformation originates,"Harnack starts out his book by dismissing entirely Eastern Christianity, the locality where most of the Apostles taught, where the oldest continuous churches exist, and where the New Testament is read daily in its original text. It is fascinating to read the erroneous assumptions Harnack made and based his conclusions about the development of Christianity. These assumptions are ignorant of the Jewish orgins and continuity of understanding and practice within Eastern Christianity -- practices that lost context in Roman Christianity and ultimately rejected in ignorance by Protestant Christianity. Unfortunately, Harnack's work, based in the limited knowledge of Western Christianity, is the foundation for what most Protestants believe is an accurate history of early Christianity. It's taught me a lot about why Western Christians believe and say what they do about the early church."
3,Not that great,"This was not as good as ""Bigger and Blacker"". The jokes about marriage and relationships are definitely 5 stars. But the majority of this simply isnt funny. He taks about sports, race and other issues, but Bigger and Blacker are definitely better."
3,Disagreement,"I purchased this DVD for my husband as a gift because I had seen part of it with a friend and found the section that I listened to pretty hilarious. My husband watched about three-quarters of the DVD and thought that there were some really funny pieces, but overall wasn't too impressed with the humour. He found some of it ""disturbing"" and not so funny."
2,"""Woody Allen Syndrome"" renders Chris very unfunny","The Woody Allen Syndrome hits, as Rock decides he must be ""serious"" and ""meaningful."" He uses his angry-young-man persona to educate us about affirmative action, George W. Bush, and marriage. Without his occassional stacatto use of ""mf-er"" as noun, verb, adjective, and adverb - there would be only two or three laughs on this DVD. Very disappointing."
1,CHRIS HAS FALLEN OFF HIS ROCK,"FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE BEEN A CR FAN SINCE THE BEGINNING AND HAVE IMMENSELY ENJOYED ALL OF HIS MATERIAL UNTIL NOW. LIKE SO MANY OTHER FALLEN STARS CHRIS FINDS A NECESSITY TO INCORPORATE POLITICS INTO HIS ENTERTAINMENT. HE HAS GOT TO HAVE THE MOST IGNORANT MIND THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICS. NOW THIS WOULD BE ALLRIGHT IF IT WERE FUNNY BUT IT'S NOT. CR GIVES EVERY AMERICAN A BAD NAME ALL IN THE NAME OF DVD SALES, TRULY PATHETIC. TERRIBLE POLITICS ASIDE, THIS IS STILL A TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME...YOU WILL FIND THE SAME OL BLACK VS. WHITE GAME WHICH HE HAS DONE A MILLION TIMES BEFORE. IF YOU WANT CR AT HIS FINEST PICK UP HIS FIRST HBO SPECIAL (ROLL WITH THE NEW I THINK?). CHRIS ROCK IS NOW OF ""ELITE STATUS"" ALONG WITH THE LIKES OF WHOOPI GOLDBERG, PUFF DADDY, THE DIXIE CHICKS,MICHAEL MOORE, ETC, ETC. THANKS FOR THE LAUGHS...GOOD RIDDANCE."
2,Just Not That Great,"What can you say about a kind of amusing stand-up routine? It's not vintage Chris Rock, in fact the best joke is the first one. Not bad, but there are better ways to waste 90 minutes."
3,Made me wish I was watching Bigger and Blacker,"While Rock's talent has made him more mainstream, his new act is much less universal--the observational and impeccably-timed humor that spoke to so many in his previous specials instead felt like a series of long-winded complaints. It's almost as if he's trying very hard to prove that, despite his enormous success, he's still a person on the fringes of society. Instead of being a voice for positive social change, he seems resigned to the fact that the underdog can never win, and it leaves the entire special with a very negative feel.Never Scared is not even close to being as funny as Bring the Pain or the side-splitting Bigger and Blacker. It starts out great (keeping his daughter off the pole), but slides downhill from there (he doesn't seem to like his wife very much, and you never quite figure out why)."
1,Unhappy,"I bought this book, it what was represented as Very Good condition. When I received it there was dried food stuck to both covers and some sort of liquid damage throughout the book. I contacted the seller, who said I could send it back and IF the claims were valid they would return my money. But I didn't have enough time to return this book and receive another in time for school so I was stuck with the nasty book. Thank God my class is only 5 weeks long. :("
4,Funny Movie,I like Phoebe Cates and I never saw this movie before. Really enjoyed it - it was a better than I thought it would be. Great nudity too.
1,Truely forgettable movie.Don't waste your time!!!,"I've never seen such a silly movie like this before.Sex,tasteless joke,stupid love story is what you'll find here.Take my advice,skip it!!"
2,"Slips off, poor design",Slips off. Local clarient dealer told me that she has spoken to the designer and she knows it is a problem. YMMV
3,Pepperpots Unite!!!,"The TARDIS encounters a sudden power failure in all systems and is forced to land on the planet Exxilon. Here, the Doctor and Sarah are caught up in a struggle between the local population to keep everyone away from thier wonderous city. They also find humans also stranded by the power failure. They need to find the cause of the power drain before anyone can leave as well as deal with the locals. Then the DALEKS arrive.The book is a great adaptation of the tv serial. It follows the plot line perfectly, even adding to it through explaining the trials, in more detail than the tv serial, the city makes the Doctor and Bellal undergo. Recommended!!!"
4,"Well Illustrated Overview of the Hanovers, Victoria, Edward","This is a pretty good history of the Hanovers and their two immediate descendants. There are alot of pictures, and fairly short biographies of each of them. The book is very informative and a very quick read. I just wish that these biographers would realize that not all of us speak French, there are never any translations. Latin I can read, but French is beyond me, and I would guess, alot of other people."
3,Eh.,"This cd is okay. If you are a true Tull fan you must have this disc. If you are a passing fan interested in their flutework and ominous lyrics, skip it and get Thick as a Brick. Thick as a Brick is much much better. A Passion Play tends to drag in points and it is more or less ""Brick"" part two. Tull has made better discs like Aqualung, Stand Up, and Brick. Go for those and skip A Passion Play."
5,Belsey Offers a Compelling Portrait of Early Gainsborough,"This is an engaging book focusing on the earlier landscape paintings and portraits completed in Ipswich and Bath. The observations on the details of the paintings are acute and perceptive. The author illuminates with a thorough knowledge of the social mores and conventions of 18th Century England. For painters and artists, the insights on formal composition and color are instructive.The narrative text is laced with a wit, humor, and irony that perhaps one can only find in an English art historian writing about a consummate English artist. The book is also mercifully focused and short, alleviating some of the bludgeon like tediousness of many art history tomes."
1,only a chapter from the Book. --it is like a pamphlet .,Its only a chapter of the book - Fontana Economic History of Europe . And the whole book costs $4-5 only from other Amazon sellers.Buy the book -- Vol 4 - Emergence of Industrial Societies. ( and you will get chapters on many other states too.)
5,Love this machine!,What a workhorse! So easy to use especially for elderly persons - no more lifting of a heavy water pot. We plug it in when we get up and don't unplug it until bedtime. Awesome machine!
5,Review - Second time!,We have previously reviewed this purchase. It arrived in a timely fashiong; was as ordered; and in good condition.Please do no ask for a third review!
5,Great and Fast service!!!!!,The bed rails came in a matter of days from the manufacturer. Great customer service.
1,A poor translation,"If you are interested in Slavitt, read this translation. If you are interested in Ovid, do not."
3,Super black & white chiller from a master monster creator,"Lon Chaney, Jr's role will evoke sympathy. Some light hearted moments as well. Though not as campy as ""Indestructable Man"" (another Chaney film from the same era)to this viewer this film has the same ""feel"" to it. The ending is awesome."
4,Not easy but worth the effort,"This book is a dialogue between a mystic and a scientist. From time to time one or the other get a bit esoteric, but the back and forth makes for surprising insights and provocations to further thinking by the reader. I would especially recommend this as a book to discuss in a group. The dialogue between readers of different backgrounds complements the dialogue within the book."
4,"Great ""On the Go"" Product","Normally this isn't something I would purchase, but my dentist offerred me some samples. My opinion is that this certainly isn't the same as brushing your teeth, this product is a great way to freshen your mouth. Sometimes I get that ""no so clean"" feeling when I run my tongue over my front teeth. These wipes are perfect for taking care of that. It's a great product to use at work or while on the go when brushing isn't an option. I feel they are definitely worth the money, and I keep some in my purse all the time now."
4,Modern Day Lawman,"CSI: Miami - The Eighth SeasonGood TV drama, the CSI series, this one is my favorite. David Caruso's character Horatio Cane is a force to be reckoned with. Spectacular action, some unpleasant images (corpes, decomposition) etc. Overall I rate this as an excellent TV drama with very good writers and production staff, although filmed in California, a Miami feel to the show is also one of the characters. Co-star Emily Procter is smart, sexy and more that able to hold her own. One of the best shows on TV today!"
5,PLEASE RELEASE SEASON 8 I LOVE CSI MIAMI!!!!!!,"I personally cannot wait for season 8 to be avaliable. It is the best show it also helps that I really like the chemistry of Calleigh & Eric, It also is good that I'm from the same state as Emily Proctor. Raleigh NC is only 40 min from me so I'm glad that we have that in common."
3,Tapas on the Story,"Tapas are small portions and that's what we get in this sub-par effort from Anthony Bidulka. And that's a surprise because I loved, absolutely loved, his previous two works: ""Amuse Bouche"" and ""Flight of Aquavit"" -- in fact I wrote raving reviews of both. Maybe there are too many characters, fifteen, to fully develop any one of them. Maybe the plot is too repetitious: nasty happenings at each port of call of a cruise ship. Maybe it's the over the top attempt to meld the Wizard of Oz into everything. (The ship is The Dorothy and it has a Cowardly Lion Lounge, and that's just a small hint of how far down the Yellow Brick Road this goes.) Whatever, it's all a bit disappointing, especially the ending -- another surprise as Bidulka is usually great at endings. There's also very little sex. Anthony: send Russell back to Saskatoon and give us the style and joy you've given us before."
5,"Cool Game, Not a Kid!",this game is really fun. it has lots of things to do inclunding games such as bowling and darts where you hurl your driver through the window. the ragdoll physics in this game are funny because your driver looks as if he was made of jello. the tracks are never the same and highly destructable. this is one of the best racing games since burnout 3.
2,Great story..... poor execution,"As a fan of historical fiction and fantasy I was looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, I was dissapointed. The storyline is choppy and the characters are poorly developed. It is often difficult to figure out who is talking and the character motivation is questionable. In addition, the medicine is just plain wrong (ie. looking for a femoral pulse in a calf). If you want a great historical fiction version of the War of the Roses, I would suggest starting with The Sunne in Splendor by SK Penman. (although there is no magic) This falls very short of the mark in all cases."
2,Not what I thought,"The only thing I really like about this boot is the style, other than that they are uncomfortable, I had to purchase insoles, and the threading on the bottom is starting to wear through and I just purchased these roughly 3 months ago."
5,great boots,these are really great boots. they were comfortable from the start without any break-in time. wore them for 15 hours with a paving crew the first day.
1,The worst boot ever,This is the worst boot I have ever worn. Not at all slip resistant. Uncomfortable. 3 hours into my shift and my feet are killing me. They leak water in and the soles are already shot after only weeks of wearing them. Worst money ever spent on boots.
5,Steel Toe,These were a gift. They were exactly what they wanted with a steel toe and fashion forward. Not too man looking either. Very comfortable I hear!
2,Lunch Walks Among Us,"Franny K. Stein is a mad scientist who prefers all things spooky and creepy, but when she has trouble making friends at her new school so she takes notes on what the other kids do differently so she could do them and make friends. Untile one day she threw her lunch in the trash can and another boy threw chemicals in the trash can to and the food and chemicals combined and formed a monster nobody knew what to do. Except for Franny and so franny did an experiment and made a nice monster out of bolonga. The nice monster threw the bad monster all the way up in space and eveybody were happy and they all started liking Franny and they all made friends with her even though she was different. The nice monster became a janitor for Franny's school."
3,a light entertainment,"The book is well written and does hold your interest. I was surprised at the reader reviewers who figured out whodunnit so early on. I never let that character cross my mind as being the murderer -- as it was so unbelievable when it was finally revealed in the last few pages. That was the major flaw of the book I thought. Very entertaining read, but not a mystery story of the first water."
3,Conclusion does not bear up to scrutiny,"I will make an effort here to not give anything away to those who haven't read the book yet, but something struck me as not right when I finished the book. I went back to some earlier passages and found out what was bothering me. Chapter 24 does not stand up to scrutiny after the culprit is finally unveiled. As American detectives often say, ""It just doesn't add up"". I have now decided that the author changed his mind about who the culprit was going to be part way through writing the book, which is fine as long as you go back and make sure what you have already written still hangs together. Given this, I'm surprised the book won an award in Sweden. I don't expect Swedish critics to forgive the faulty logic."
1,not what you might expect...,"if you are thinking of purchasing this book after devouring the Larsen triology or because you've finished all the Wallander mysteries...don't expect anything comparable. the characters are painfully two-dimensional and the translation really clunky, a flat plot with even flatter prose. get it from the library if you are curious.!"
4,Debut Inspirational,"MEASURE OF FAITH opens up with Lynette Montgomery overwhelmed with devastating news from her doctor. Why is all of this happening now when life seemed so perfect? Perhaps too perfect until she awakens to reality. In the beginning Lynette dribbles with self-pity, and challenges the patience of a loving husband. (Are there actual men like him left on this planet?) Thus begins the rollercoaster ride of faith-challenging events for the Montgomery family. Ms. Billings is a wonderful storyteller with lessons to ponder. An inspirational to curl up to -- to reflect and enjoy. A debut novel I recommend."
4,Have Faith!,"This is a great debut novel. I was hooked after reading the first chapter because I have been through what Lynnette was going through. I am single and childless, but I still had a health issue that required faith in God and the belief that everything is for my good(Rom 8:28). I congratulate Maxine Billings on her first novel. I look forward to reading more from her. I pray that she will continue to allow God to use her to bless others."
2,Boring,"The three stories were short (which, considering their quality, was a blessing), I truly didn't care what would happen to the characters. Skip it"
1,SOUND QUALITY,"I'M ASSUMING THIS IS MP3 QUALITY, OR AN MP3 CD-R, NOT .WAV QUALITY SOUND !MP-3 DISCS WILL NOT PLAY ON SOME EQUIPMENT."
3,Didn't Last Long,"In the beginning it worked fine. Accurate to a few degrees as I could determine. Slow to cometo equilibrium. As others have noted, the magnet is not strong enough to attached the unit securely. Consequently, I dropped it numerous times. It seem to survive this punishment o.k.However, after about 6 months, it now reads about 10 degrees high. Quien sabe. I've retired it, and I am going to try a different make."
1,Failed after 3 Months,The title of this review says it all. The thermometer stopped working after just a couple of months.I obviously would not buy a again and would not recommend it.
1,Worked for less than 1 hour,"Worked great for 50 mins. then temp started climbing about 1F / sec. Now displays 123.4F @ room temp. Will be contacting support and post outcome. Also, product picture does not match product shipped."
4,Interesting ew recording,"Hi,This new recording of music from the films of Stanley Kubrick by the Prague Orchestra offers a new chance to listen to the melodies in very good technical quality. My favorite Lolita theme is missing, but then there is a limit to what can go onto a CD.I can highly recommend this CD to every lover of Kubrick films."
1,Don't buy this,"What a turd. This thing will not hold an edge. Shoot, it won't even try to hold an edge. All it does is smash/mash anything we try to use it on. I hope to be able to return it for a full refund."
1,One of the worst racing games I have ever played,"To sum it up in a word, this game .... The controls are poor, all the cars steer exactly the same, the characters are plain and unoriginal and the circuit champions always have some cheap trick up their sleeve by grabbing the SAME COLOR BLOCK EVERY TIME. The Build-A-Car mode is pitiful, because all the pieces are square allowing no aerodynamicness until you snag Captain Redbeard's set. And what do you get when you beat the game? Nothing. This game is horrible. Leave it to people who like throwing money away."
2,Truly Dissapointed,"My son received this game as a gift for his birthday. We were both very dissapointed when we opened the game and began to play. There are only 4 tracks to choose from and none of them are very exciting. Many of the tracks are hard to see and when you add more than on player, it becomes even harder. The pace is also very slow. Even my 5 year old was unimpressed."
4,"For Women -- Especially those facing ""Change""","I think this is a heroine for our times! This is not one of those young, pouty-lipped, long-legged, blondes with whom every other male character falls in love. This is a real character with whom you want to meet for lunch and dish the dirt. This will be one of those you pass on to other female friends of a ""certain age."" I don't think men will like this one. They just won't get it. I also like the use of letters and emails to start off each chapter. It really helps move the story."
2,Not a page turner,"I bought this book after reading that this series was comparable to Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series (One for the Money, etc.) Sadly, there is no comparison. There is little suspense or tension of any kind in this story. The menopausal humor never made me laugh. The dialogue is stilted, the characters are not particularly appealing. For fun mysteries with lots of laughs I suggest reading Janet Evanovich; for entertaining mysteries in a fascinating setting try Tony Hillerman."
5,CIS is my favorite show,"I love this show after 10 seasons. I miss the original cast, but enjoy the new cast members and the variety they bring to the story line."
5,A beautifully detailed toy.,"I bought this toy (along with the woolly mammoth, sabre-toothed tiger and tiger cub) for my niece. I found that this toy is beautifully designed and very tough. The detail is incredible, as is the price. I would suggest buying it with the woolly mammoth, so your child or prehistoric animal enthusiast could have a family. This is a wonderful toy and I would definitely recommend it."
4,Belmo's Books,I already have all of Bemo's other books and I think they're all great. My fave is THE BEATLES-NOT FOR SALE. Very detailed. PSYCHEDELIA is a great look at an era/genre of music created when the world was changing and one of the main reasons for this change was the music.
2,Very strong taste,"This is a very dark and incredibly strong tasting tea. The name sounded good, so I gave it a shot. But I hate the heavy flavor and it doesn't taste like vanilla or maple -- just like a very strong black tea.If you like chai tea, it may appeal to you."
2,Gross!,"Smelled funny and didn't taste good at all! I bought these in a pack of six and had to throw out 5 of the 6 boxes because they just did not taste good. Tried adding milk to the tea but it was just too strong and again, the smell was replusive.Stick with the Vanilla Hazelnut and you won't be disappointed."
1,Great Idea but software is the worst no support from company,These guys have great potential but they can't support any of there products - website is out of date links are broke to software downloads. You can stay on hold for hours waiting for support and no answer. You call sales they answer in seconds. I think they are modeling them selves after HP. Software is poorly done.
4,too much information,good book if you have passion too read it .useful clinically every aspect iscoverd take as refernce book
5,Love that Grateful Dawg!,"I found this CD by accident while I was searching around the same section for the Grateful Dead's newly released Night Fall of Diamonds.(Yes, I'm a admitted ""Deadhead"") I have for sometime enjoyed the CD releases of the team up of mandolin player David ""Dawg"" Grisman and the late guitar legend Jerry Garcia. These releases are quite different from Garcia's work with the Dead and harken back to the folk roots that he started with.If you have any interest in folk, blues or bluegrass you will enjoy this wide ranging overview of the Garcia-Grisman collaboration.My personal favorites from this disc include the beautiful ""Sittin Here in Limbo"",or the somber"" Off to the Sea Once More"" and the very funny ""Jenny Jenkins"". Yes, if you have their other albums, there is much duplication. But this does make a wonderful sampler that will keep your toes tapping as it plays on the car stereo."
3,Dragon's Were Way Too SLow,"The book was okay. But one factor made me unable to take it seriously, even as fantasy: the dragons fly too slowly. Dragons the size of the ones in the novel would have a stall speed somewhere above 75 knots (a 737 stalls at 130 knots, but then again, doesn't flap its wings), and probably cruise at 100-120 knots. But as far as I can tell, their maximum speed in the novel is more like 30 or 35 knots. That's REALLY slow. If you saw one flying at altitude, it would seem more like a drifting balloon.Seeing super slow dragons drifting in my mind's eye proved too much for my imagination to bear."
4,Suprisingly Good Story!,"I didn't know anything about this book but wanted to try it out on my iTouch Kindle software. At first I thought, ""This is going to be silly""... but the more I read, the more I enjoyed the story. Well written, well researched, and just a great all around effort. You won't be sorry to take the time to read this excellent tale and I look forward to reading the rest!"
4,Good story,"It's not Shakespeare, and about a thousand semicolons should be removed or replaced. But it's a good story, interesting and entertaining."
3,Intriguing But Not Satisfying,"I was somewhat disappointed by ""His Majesty's Dragon"". I kept waiting for something exciting to happen, but it never did. The main character, Captain Will Laurence, was likeable but flat, with little depth or backstory. His dragon, Temeraire, was a more interesting character. Laurance's romantic involvement with another character begins abruptly, and is little explored.Still, I found the concepts in this book fascinating. The setting--the Napoleonic was--is well developed and interesting. The idea of war with dragons (organized similar to war at sea) is also very well developed. Much of the book was devoted to establishing this setting.I am not sure if I would recommend this book, except as casual entertaining for a fantasy fan. If the other books in the series are an improvement, a weak first volume may be overlooked."
3,great fun but not enough there for me to try more,I really enjoyed reading this. Id happily recommend it to my friends teenage children.But the relationship and mentality with the dragon was too disneyish for my own tastesso I wont try more of her books. 3 stars mostly to remind myself of this and not todiscourage the rest of you.
5,Enchanting,"Who would have thought I'd enjoy this type of book? I really did. Didn't put it down until it was done, and looked for more. Read super on my iPhone app and Kindle 4."
5,A Wonderful Ride!,"Its been a long time since I picked up a book and couldn't put it down, but this book really captured my imagination. Novik sets her tale in the near past layering a fantastic story on actual history in a unique way. You become enthralled not just by the characters but how the existance of dragons might have changed the world. Novik is a fantastic new voice and I can't wait to read the next book in the trilogy. You won't be disappointed!"
5,A new dragon epic,"I have just read all three books within a matter of days. All I can say is that this is my new Pern. The first book is fabulous (and they get better from there). Novik doesn't pull punches and it's clear that she has it all worked out from the beginning. I spent each night nervous for what would happen to Temeraire, Laurence, and the crew as well as the other dragons and their crews. There's quite a menagerie of characters, but the story stays solid throughout. I'm only disappointed that there are 3 (for the moment)."
2,Poor Packaging,Unit was beat up when I got it due to poor packaging. One small piece of bubble wrap on top of unit. Not wrapped in bubble wrap. Unit was beat up but worked.
2,Mom's Bathtub Reader - Didn't like it,This Reader is not like the others I have. The others are short snippets of information. This one is longer stories of women in various times of their life and with varying accomplishments. Too long to sit and read for short periods of time.
1,The secret is it's a bad low budget movie with a 5 star review,"No story, Poorly shot, poorly written - just an excuse for the movie maker to shoot soft pornand poorly done at that.I think it was made by a bunch of kids who got hold of a camera.5 start review must have been written by the movie maker as no onewould give this anything but the lowest rating."
5,Oh my happy epilepsy,"Whenever I feel too romantic and serious about music, I put this on and go &$""&@()?¿)$)&!"". I just LOVE this kind of attitude, blasting away without compromise, leaving nothing but startled critics and confused musicians in the way. The DEFINITIVE post-punk for me... done with masterous dexterity by the way... INCREDIBLE."
4,Bluesy gospel fun,"I was not familiar with Jonny Lang's music before this album, but had heard about his precocious guitar skills and decided to try it after reading an article about his conversion. His beliefs are clear on the album, so if you have a problem with Christianity, you may have a problem with the CD. Regardless of the songs' message (in essence, redemption, second chances, grace, acceptance and forgiveness), this is a great album full of catchy melodies and a nod to the blues--both the music and the emotions that are inevitably a part of the faith experience. I would've given it 4 1/2, just because I don't enjoy the harsher, ""rot-gut"" blues that creep into a couple of the songs. Overall, an enjoyable and positive album. Go Jonny!"
1,I just don't believe,"Jonny Lang is one of my favorite artists ever, but this album is not good. I don't even know where it is right now. I didn't put it in my Ipod and I'm not going to. This album reminds me of the scene in Walk The Line where the producer tells Johnny Cash ""Son I just don't believe you when you sing gospel"". That's how I feel about this album, I just don't believe. Sure Elvis can put out a gospel album. Heck Elvis could put out any kind of album he wants, not all artists have the gift to make you believe in everything they sing. I totally respect an artist's right to write and record what they want, but I also don't have to listen to it. I love all his other albums and continue to listen to them regularly."
3,The Blues Guitar is Missing,"Artists have the right to change directions and seek new audiences - and in some cases the change is well received. With that in mind, Jonny is no longer the blues guitarist of his earlier albums, he has taken a new direction into R&B; - I agree with the reviewer that said he now sounds like Stevie Wonder. If that is what you like, then buy this. If you are looking for great guitar, look elsewhere.(Have you ever noticed that when someone writes a review that doesn't give the artist 4 or 5 stars - the reviewer gets slammed in the votes?)"
5,Made me a believer!,"This is Jonny at his best! Wow, turn this one up loud and feel the power in his voice, his music. I'm definitely a believer because of Jonny. He has made me turn around."
5,Change is Good.,"Turn Around is an excellent disc, enjoyable from start to finish. Mr. Lang appears to have found his groove on this one.His last project found him transitioning from the blues boy we've all come to know and love, to a rock and souler which none of us recognized. It was simply too much, too soon. This disc offers a more seamless transition, better helping us to accept the fact that the Blues Boy that was Jonny Lang has been replaced with an artist that seems mature, natural and at ease with his music. Lets face it, the blues thing was good for a while, getting our attention and making us fans; this style, however, serves to solidify what appears to be Mr. Lang's true style.On Turn Around, Jonny Lang earns my respect and proves that change is good.If you do not have this disc...GET IT!!! You will not be disappointed."
5,Jonny's Best Album,"This is one of the better albums I've heard in a while. It is a soulful, raw, bluesy and, shall I say, gutsy album. Jonny where's his heart on his sleeve. In a world ruled by plastic pop stars singing about the next piece of booty their going to get, it's nice to hear an artist keeping it real; that's exactly what Jonny does. This album has some true genius in it. I can't wait to see him when he comes through town."
3,armageddon '99...therez been better,"Ok you wanna buy this video? go ahead, but please rent it first...There are only a few good matches that are worth just watching. Like the 3 way European title match: Val vs Bulldog vs D'lo was a good match and so was the 4 corner evening gown in a pool elimination match: jacky vs b.b. vs ivory vs kat basically because there was a cat fight in a pool between 4 of the hottest ladies and some nudity at the end. The rest is all mishmash as a team of almost 1,000 lbs, that is, Big Vis and Rikishi vs 2 mid-weights in an extremely dumb match and not to mention the 3 minute WWF Championship match between Big Show and Big Bossman which we all knew the outcome was. Big Bossman as the champion? Might as well put the belt on Howard Finkel.So Anywayz, the main event wasnt bad but wasnt good, as Vince isnt really a wrestler so the match wasnt 100% awesome, but the ending was shocking. As i said earlier, please RENT before buying. overall a 7 out of 10 PPV"
3,Dont listen to people,"If you like military shooters than this game is definitely for you. Maybe if you dont' like them, you wont like this game much, but then, why would you buy it? This game has many weapons and vehicles that you constantly use in single and multi player. It is a great shooter, however the reason i gave it a ""4"" is because shooting is pretty much all you do. Every mission you have to retrieve an envelope or something like that, but you might as well have just left that out of the game and let people shoot at the enemy the whole time because its fun in this game, but with the envelopes, its not adding fun, its adding plot. So basically buy this game if your into shooters, if you think shooters are ok, dont buy it because it could have been a lot more creative in its mission plots"
1,Don't buy it.,"This is a crappy shooter. It is too bland, the graphics suck, the AI is terrible, is horribly repetitive. I borrowed this from a friend, only to realize that it is a waste of time and space. If you are looking for a good FPS, you should checkout Doom 3, Battlefield 2, Halo, or Halflife 2. But be sure to pass on this one."
2,NO MORE RASPBERRY FLAVOR IN Celestial Seasons Raspberry Gardens,"I am a long time lover of Celestial Seasons tea, and loved Raspberry Gardens Green Tea until this shipment. They changed the formula of this tea and their other fruit flavored green tea to taste more like green tea. Doesn't make sense to me, the reason people buy flavored teas is for the flavor. I love the benefits of green tea but not so crazy about the flavor so I tried and purchased several green tea brands and flavors. I spoke with Celestial Seasons and they decided to change the blend to make it more of a green tea flavor. If that is what we want we would just purchase their green tea with no flavor blends. Very disappointing."
1,Its not the same!,"I WAS on subscribe and save for this product because I loved the intense raspberry flavor, but they have changed it. Now it is just like those other green teas. How sad! Change it back!!!"
1,Let the tea drinker beware,"Let me say, the first time I tasted Celestial Seasonings Raspberry Gardens Green Tea, I was in heaven. Had I written this review then, when the tea was a lovely shade of transparent red-purple with a light blackberry flavor, I would have given it 20 stars. But according to Celestial Seasonings Customer Support, they have changed the recipe, removing the hibiscus and blackberry and leaving that delightful ""Mr's Yuk's Bathwater"" flavor in it's place. I kid you not. The tea is now a sickly yellow green with less hint of raspberry now, than before. The box still looks the same, and the ingredients list still includes hibiscus and blackberry - but it's a lie! Let the drinker beware."
4,"good, dark, romantic Vamping","This is just an early version of Nancy Baker's Kiss of the Vampire. If you can't get this one, you should try the later version. Baker does a great job of showing the slow transition from meek, well-mannered human to vampirism. She really lets you get inside Ardith's head as she makes the transition."
3,It's OK,"I was rather disappointed with this album. I liked ""Ten Year Night"" much better. This one was often very depressing, and sometimes really cheesy. There were a couple of good tracks in the beginning, but it slips downhill after about the third song, and by the end you're glad it's over."
2,What can you say it's Smitty Built,I highly recommend you stay away from any smitty built product. I put this bumper on a 93 Renegade YJ. First it does not fit a Renegade as claimed on Amazon. I had to cut out part of the body cladding to get it to fit. I know there are not a lot of Renegades out there but thought it was worth mentioning because I ordered this bumper because it said it would fit one. Now for the product in general. First off I have the rear bumper and tire carrier from Smitty I bought both at the same time. All products barley fit. The powder coating is so cheep if you look at it it scratches. One side of the front bumper sits closer to the fender by almost an inch. This can not be fixed without modifying the lower and upper bolt holes. They do give room for adjustment but in my case I could barley get the bolts in even with the slack they provide with the mounting holes. Read jeep forms for real reviews on this before buying. The bumpers are cheaper than others for a reason.
2,Political drama for the simple-minded,"I waited for the twists - in every political drama you've got to have twists, but the one single twist is so absurd and adolescent in its lack of intelligence it's laughable.Stylish film, watchable actors - I'm sure Blair-haters and `Stop the War' merchants wet themselves with excitement watching this, but as an intelligent political drama it failed big-time."
4,Good thriller,Liked it as a thriller. Well crafted. My family wasn't crazy about its political message. The ending could have been better.
2,I was expecting more...,"As entertaining as it was, this movie was too predictable and less thrilling than I thought it would be. Considering the cast, I thought it would be more of a thriller than an entertaining movie. Definitely can wait to see it on cable."
2,Nothing special,"The movie was very mediocre. The plot was a bit slow and boring at times. If you don't see this movie, you want miss much."
1,Google Search knows all,"As mentioned by previous reviewers, it's hard to take this movie serious since Google Search is the prime means of solving the mystery. Also, the ending is anticlimactic, and more of a cop out than anything else."
4,Sophisticated Political Thriller,"I enjoyed this. It's a clever, sophisticated political thriller. All the acting was solid, including Kim Cattrall, who I didn't recognize at first with that accent. It's a movie that quietly progresses, builds tension, respects the viewer's intelligence, and has a Hitchcock vibe to the lighting and music.The ending is good, too. Surprising."
2,Very disappointing!!,"I was expecting a return to the classic EJ sound of the 1970's, but this record has no hooks or anything that stands out. I'm a huge EJ fan, but this release is weak!Bummer! : ("
4,The Vinyl Rocks - The CD doesn't,"The Captain & the Kid [Vinyl]I got this on CD and played it 10 times waiting to like it. I thought it was boring. Years later I read about the loudness wars and decided to give the album a chance on Vinyl - WHAT A DIFFERENCE! The CD was WAY OVER COMPRESSED!The Vinyl sounds warm and is full of dynamic range and I can feel the emotion of the performance. A few listens through and this album went from one of my least favorites to one of his best. I LOVE this album now. I imported the Vinyl audio in to my computer so I could play this version on my itunes and ipod. I would rather live with the imperfections of Vinyl (some hiss a few pops and clicks) then hear how badly they sterilized it for CD.I hope that some day this album will get a ""proper' mastering on CD!"
2,Dissapointed in the Kidd,"My wife and are a great fan of Elton John and have quite a few of his recordings however after playing this resent release ""Captain and the Kid"" we where truly dissapointed and have sense put it in our archives to play no more."
1,The Captain & the Kid,This is a very poorly written recording. Not anything near the quality of his previous work including Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy. I am very disappointed with it.
4,Have a listen to Elton John's The Captain and the Kid,"Being a fan of the great EJ and fully enjoying the great album of Captain Fantastic, I was eagerly awaiting the much delayed sequel and was amply awarded when I gave it a listen. EJ can still rock, ballad and make us think as he always had. This is the most complete consistent album Sir Reggie has crafted since Captain Fantastic."
3,"sark, i get your point: you like taking naps","I've read most of SARK's books and found that she tends to repeat herself within a book and between books......so, once you've read ONE of her books, you need to read no more.....they say the same thing in different words and different pictures."
4,"Some wonderful stories, ideas, thoughts...",A great way to rlax. Wonderful for all ages. Fits the title pretty well
4,pleasurable afternoon pop,scott brookman makes pop of past ages. harmonies from the beach boys compliments piano/organ based jazzy melodic musica. some might say he sounds like the high llamas or maybe something else european. buy it and relax in that afternoon nap to it!!
5,Mystery So Long...How would you describe it?,"Simply put, Stephen Dobyns is sassy, irreverant, honest, and appears to have had as much fun writing this collection of poems as I have had reading them. After hearing the poet at a reading last week, and enjoying this collection, I have already ordered ""Velocities."" It is impossible not to smile or even guffaw while reading Stephen Dobyns."
5,Another lovely book from a wonderful writer.,"Just as he did in MY NAME ESCAPES ME, Sir Alec Guinness pens another lovely book of memories, reflections, anecdotes, musings, and observations drawn from his journal. He is not just an extraordinary actor, but a superb writer with a clean, exact, elegant style, a shrewd eye, a wise mind and soul, a warm heart, and a sharp tongue.Reading his prose is an unalloyed pleasure, and the only regrets this book inspires are that he has decided (for good and valid reasons) to retire from acting, and that this might indeed be his final appearance. I hope that he will write again."
1,Packaging Nightmare!!!!!,"I ordered this product so that I would not have to keep going to the store weekly for more. I waited a week for the arrival, but when I got it, the entire case was damaged. Called UPS and they picked it up the next business day. Called Amazon and they said we will send you a new case overnight. Well that was a Friday and I didn't get it until Monday and once again it was damaged. I just called and cancelled. What is the use of having it delivered if it can't get here in good condition and the first time around????"
2,the handle burnned up. leave the stove dirty,It seems to be falling apart. any time we use it makes a mess on the stove. It takes a long time to heat
3,"Works, Not Pretty","I recently bought a new gas range and the simmer setting is too high. So, I remember my mom using a simmer ring on her range, but didn't see any in stores. I found this one and it works very well, but after a very short time it has rusted and the bamboo? handle is splintering. It isn't as nice as the one my mom had for years, but it does work well."
5,Just what I wanted!,This flame tamer was something I had been looking for and found it in an instant on Amazon. I did not want to pay a huge amount and there it was. Great product and the handle comes in very handy.
4,Birthday Party Fun1,"I bought this for my 7 year old Godson's birthday party. He and his friends really like Star Wars, and what 7 year old wouldn't enjoy a pinata! It was a lot of fun to see how much the kids enjoyed the whole experience."
1,dont buy this! darth vader 3d pinata....,"the pinata broke the first hit, it was very cheap..... waste of money, we even tried to cut a hole and retie it up. it was made with the cheapest cardboard and broke again...."
3,Sprintzen,I have Mrs. [Alice] Sprintzen as a teacher! She is the High Tech Art teacher in Oyster Bay High School. One of my friends found out she wrote a couple books so I had to find them. A new one will be coming out year or so with student's works. Awesome! [Hi ARI! Knew you'de be here!]
1,I'd give it zero if I could,"I'm required to read this book for my English class nd if I had a choice I'd have thrown it away. The characters are painfully dimensional. There is hardly plot to speak of and what plot there is, is told out of order. First Leila is eloping with Mason and telling Mah about it. Then Mah is askibg her when she's getting married. Then Leila is with her sister in New Yorl. Then she's back in San Francisco. To make it even worse, Ng never gives us a clue where or when the character is. this might be forgivible if the story was interesting and provided a reason. As it is, I'm glad I on;y paid 66 cents for it."
1,don't bother,I'm running Windows 7 and it won't install because the software doesn't recognize anything beyond Windows XP. If I had known this I would never have ordered it!!
4,THE SINGULAR RUTH BELL,"I think this is Cornwell's best book, you can feel her love for Graham. Ruth Graham had an extraordinary life, her life in may ways is as interesting as her iconic husband. Her early live in China and how it enlightened her, it's interesting that such a forward thinking woman married the most famous evangelical. I found the information on her courtship with Billy fascinating, he really had to win her, she was beautiful and he know he had to be at the top of his game to get her. Ruth Graham was an amazing woman, though i was dismayed to see that she gave in and allowed herself to be buried in Charlotte instead of her chosen place Montreat, but ultimately she couldnt imagine not being next to Billy. Very good book on a singular American."
5,Excellent Book,"What a lady, Ruth Graham. She really went through and saw a lot in her life time. You really get to see the woman behind Rev. Billy Graham. This was a well written biography of a very Godly woman. I am sure this was an exciting journey for Ms. Cornwell to sit with Ruth Graham and talk about her life. This is a wonderful book, if you haven't read it get it and read it. You won't be disapointed."
4,interesting information,The author becomes immersed in the culture and religion of the people he is observing. He writes of his experience without belittling a little known section of our Southern religious heritage. Worth a read if you are interested in this cultural phenomenon.
2,"Works in 98, not in 2000 or ME","I have 98, and the card works just fine..but when I installed 2000 pro, server, and ME, the card wouldn't be automatically detected in any of those. I tried manually installing the card, but no drivers are on the CD for ME, 2000, or server. There was only a read me that says the card will be automatically detected..which it wasn't. Plus, no phone support? I cannot find any phone number on this cd..and no book or documentation whatsoever came with this card. Unsatisfied.....very bad."
5,One-Day-At-A-Time Therapy,Good little book that gives you a lot of short reading and good messages. Enjoyed the books very much. They also make good small gifts for any occasion.
2,A Confusing Book,"For studying the speech recognition subject this is not the right book to buy, It is hard to understand the theory using this book.The c++ code works but there should be more remarks to make it easier to the readers to get along.There is a free toolkit to download from the Internet named HTKthat contains full C code and a free book to the same theory so actually it is a waste of money to buy this book !!!"
1,Hmmmm... No,No nudity in this movie. You get to see a very brief appears to be poorly simulated sex scene with the girl on the cover of the film. She leaves her underwear on. Not a good skin flick. You can read about the story in the other reviews. I bought this strictly for skin...and it wasnt there.
5,A Love Letter to Independent Films,"If you miss what independent films used to be, this one is for you.This film is made in the dirty indie style you don't see anymore.Social satire, music, broad sexual parody, gross guy humor, George Bush humping Lady Liberty, Karl Rove screwing Mt Rushmore: this film packs a lot into 104 minutes. And it criticizes the war in Irag.Best enjoyed with friends and some beers, laughs are guaranteed.If you haven't seen the trailers for BackPage, check out:http://www.vimeo.com/11013011or the film's website:http://www.backpagemovie.com"
3,Beautifully boring,"3 1/2Frayne is a pro at walking a fine line between spirited and lifeless gently-reverbed guitar instrumentals, and Elm Street is no exception. There is a bit of variety here, although forays into electronica feel more contrived than Lanterna's patented desert highway strumming. Still ES survives intact on the right side of a quality release."
5,Outstanding and Emotional,"This is a story of trust and betrayal, love and hate, good and evil. It is remarkable! I was so moved by this story that I actually begin to cry. It is a good christian story of what happens when one has abandoned God and what happens when one finds God. I recommend it highly to anyone wanting to know God or just wants a GOOD READ!"
1,"Really, really, sucks!","Want to learn about buying probates, don't bother buying this book. Try NOLO Press or search the internet for anything but this piece of garbage. Rarely do I feel ripped off from a book that doesn't deliver, but this one qualifies. There are 240+ pages, the Appendix (starting on page 111) is full of examples from different states ads on Notice to Creditors and a few charts of how much attorneys can charge in each state. Of the 8 chapters covering 110 pages, only 4 really deal with buying probate properties. The first 2 chapters tell you why you should invest in real estate. This is a high school level term paper that could have been condensed down to a pamphlet. From a guy who charges [...] for his seminar, you would expect a little more, but then that's probably what he really wants to sell you. [...]. Come on Jim, get your act together and give us some meat."
1,Two thumbs DOWN! WAY DOWN!,"Little to no information! AS a previous review stated, you are paying for a giant appendix! If you know nothing about probate, go to your local book store and read chapter 3. This book praises the process but really doesn't answer enough questions. I contacted a lawyer in my area after reading it, unless you live in California, double check with your attorney, not every state is created equal."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"What a joke. Don't buy this book. It was a complete waste of my time and energy. Several problems with it... It is packed with a TON of filler material. It has a few goofy stories about probate situations, which are mildly interesting. It also contains a lot of rediculous ""insight"" about real estate investing in general, that I can't help but wonder if the author is actually a real estate investor. It certainly doesn't sound like it! And, pages 111-244 are filled with nothing but useless junk including court system flow charts and classified ads! This is only book I have ever bought on the topic of real estate investing that I felt was a complete waste of money. The author simply does not share any practical information on doing probate deals. Its real substance is in pages 46-54. Read those at the bookstore and then leave it there."
5,Allergy and Candida Cooking: Understanding & Implementing Plans for Healing,Anyone who has allergies should read this book!! The way that the book is organized makes it a very easy read. The book has great recipes and with the spiral binding you can lay it out as you prepare the diverse meals.
1,"HW good, software -deal killer","No real issues with the hardware. (where it gets the stars)Software is an unmitigated disaster. Works or not at a whim. Or stops working in the middle of an operation. USB or networked, does not matter. Fails reliably on several models of laptops, then works again. Exasperating. Can't run a business with this thing. Have three of these boat anchors, provides full time employment for tech. About as desirable as bird flu.Was strongly pro HP... but with the LJ3015, LJ3050 bloatware and now this, we're considering a major change."
1,Probably not the best value,"I really like some features about this printer but it is a hog when it comes to extra toner cartridges, etc. The cartridges cost about $75.00 each and you will need 3 colors plus black. The imaging drum is about $170.00.It will not scan or copy in black & white, everything must be done in color - VERY EXPENSIVE. Now I am getting an error that there is a problem with the fuser. The replacement part is $250.00. I have had this printer less than 2 years and have replaced the color cartridges and the imaging drum many times. I do not print a lot of things, less than 15 pages per day.Today, I called tech support and got a person with a heavy foreign accent. I wasted so much time trying to get the person to understand my issues. And she kept repeating what I had just told her. I finally gave up.Think twice about purchasing this printer."
2,"Good print quality, BAD drivers and software, expensive to own","After a year of owning this printer we finally had to switch it out for a cheaper Brother with more features and functioning software. This All in one prints really well after you manage to configure it. The scanning software still doesnt work on the networtk with Vista. Duplexing is limited. No wifi. The toner and drums are expensive. If you have XP and are connected directly to it, it works really well, if not, its a gamble."
2,EXPENSIVE to own,"This is a good printer, but before you buy one, Google the phrase ""HP 2840 carousel misalignment"" and learn about the pain people like me have suffered. The carousels break easily, and the cost to replace is high. Plus, you'll pay more for consumables than you pay for the printer in the first two years or so - HP just charges too much for the toner. Finally, the resolution isn't up to the quality of other printers that are cheaper and better designed, like the Brother DCP-9040 ...Brother DCP-9040cn Color Laser Copier and Printer with Built-in Ethernet Network Interface"
1,Bad network device,"We got this printer 1 year ago, drivers for vista took forever to be available.Drivers are big and bulky and take 40 - 50min to install per machine.Network scanning feature doesn't work in neither Windows XP or Vista clients. (We have 20+computers and tried turning on/off firewalls etc)Print quality is very good both in BW and color, but slow. The printer wastes a lot of toner and drum. The supplies count pages and when the count is up you have no printer. Even a single character counts as 1 page.HP support only shipped a CD with drivers and after not being able to solve the problems, ignored any other request. We replaced the printer with a Brother MFC series and all users are happy.Buyer beware, this printer is no good."
2,I like three songs,"Maybe I should have listened to the CD more? I just couldn't get into this albums rhythm. Some songs were boring or just drawn out with annoying bellowing. I felt like the growth was forced, and the album might have been rushed. I suggest legally downloading the tracks you like. His first album was miles ahead of his second and third. I suggest that, MOS, commits to making a quality album while only concentrating on the music and not the movies."
4,Back to good old-fashioned Hip-hop,"I'll admit, this album is no Blackstar or Black on Both Sides, but it is a good production nonetheless. More of the upbeat, intelligent Mos Def we have grown to love."
5,The Story of a Unique Friendship,"Dr. Bell and Helen Keller were two of the most notable people living during the late 1800's and early 1900's. The depth of their friendship, and their encouragement of one another's life work, is a testimony to what two people can accomplish together. The author supplies many details about Dr. Bell and his work among the deaf. A recommended addition to any public or private library."
1,From all the positive reviews I thought it would be good....,"I'm always looking for good books and picked this up after seeing all the good reviews and recalling a friend's recommendation from years ago. Now de Bernieres is not a bad writer per se, and the book does keep you somewhat interested. However to me, overall, it turned out to be rather trite with a ridiculous ending.Now I don't read many romance novels, so this may color my view on the thing. I suggest that if you aren't typically into romance novels definitely skip this one. If you are, you might like it although the ending will leave you empty....then again some people may be looking for that. Personally, I wish I hadn't read it.For an excellent review read Katie Surrence's review of August 1, 2002. It does however contain spoiler's that will ruin the book."
5,Flawless prose,"Corelli's Mandolin is a captivating tale, rich with eloquent observations on the human condition. I ordered it at the end of September along with the highly acclaimed new WWII novel The Triumph and the Glory for my husband and the phenomenal Harry Potter books for my sons. We are one happy reading family right now. Thanks amazon."
4,Believe the hype!,"If you are the type of person who gets bored quickly, I would not recommend this book, as the first quarter of the novel consists mainly of historical scene-setting, which seems slightly tedious. This aside, ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" is a very moving and exciting book."
2,Well written but totally inaccurate historically,The fiction part of this novel is well written and entertaining. The history part of it is inaccurate and fully distorted by the personal views of the writer. He is assuming right and wrong based on his political philosophy. The explanation he gives on the author's note shows how partial he is. His historical knowledge is as accurate as saying that Britain is still an empire. He should stick to purely fictional novels.
3,Good read but weak ending,The books first two thirds are outstanding but its weak ending leaves one with a dissappointing feeling of what could have been.
3,"Excellent for the most part, but very disappointing ending","I thoroughly enjoyed the first 90% of this novel. The character development and day to day detail of WWII Greece were enthralling. However, in the last 40 pages the author covers 40 years in an almost outline form and generates a very disappointing and unsatisfying ending. If the last 40 pages were more developed and as fleshed-out as the first 400 pages, I would have gladly read-on for 200 pages more."
3,"Mostly brilliant and evocative, soap opera ending","Corelli knew quite a few of the villagers and one or two questions would have told him what was going on with Pellagia. The ending is so mushy and improbable (a perfect ending for an American movie} that for me it dilutes the power of this brilliant book. Bernieres' use of language and his prose make me marvel at his talent . If the end of the book had been written in the same style as the earlier chapters then, it would have ranked as a masterpiece."
4,Keep on Trekking,"After speaking with friends about this novel I heard the same comment repeatedly...I am having toruble getting through the beginning. Atmittedly slow at times, this novel is truly worth the effort. The characters slowly but surely draw you into their lives and take you on an adventure in war and love."
5,A wonderful world which you are reluctant to ever leave.,"De Berniere's depiction of Cephallonia is at once magical and entrancing. He creates wonderful scenes and also a powerful sense of interaction between characters and the community as a whole. The romantic in you wants a happier ending earlier in the novel, but this cannot detract from the sheer power of sentiment which he manages to create. The novel is less dark than some of de Bernieres other works, and this is perhaps another of its virtues. I reccommend this novel to everyone - and have yet to find someone who hasn't enjoyed it. Unfortunately it is one of those novels which makes you regret that a book has to have a start and an end."
3,Corellis mandoilin review,"Like many people, I heard a lot about this book before reading it. Unfortunately for me, this book really didn't live up to that every body else was saying. I felt like the author didn't know whether he wanted to write a love story, a historical novel, or war novel. A more successful book would have woven all these characteristics together, instead I found the book felt like it went from place to place and it seemed like he didn't know how to mesh the two together. Many parts are long-winded and really boring. And oh, the ending. Was I the only one driven to distraction by the frustrating ending? That said, there are some really wonderful parts to this book, especially the gay love story. However, be prepared. This book, I think, is probably a love it or hates it kind of book. If you like the love story you'll like this book but personally I didn't like this book very much."
5,"Noble, warm and sad","This is an excellent book - take it's story, language, spirit, or anyhting else - full with true passion and kind wisdom."
5,Corelli Comes Alive,"I have just finished this book this morning and am already yearning to be with the inhabitants of Cephallonia again. The characters in the new book I have picked up seem flat and dull to me. I am still amazed that the author was able to tell such a coherant and stunning tale in so many voices, using so many different tones and techniques. ""Corelli's Mandolin"" is a really great piece of work and a wonderful story. Do read it"
5,Amazing!,"Please, please, please take the time to get into this book. The begining is slow, but like in a Hardy novel, everything you learn is crucial for the rest of the story. Each character becomes so real that to finish the book is loose good friends. This is one of the best books I have ever read."
3,"Good, but ending is lame","I won't repeat many of the good things other reviewers have said. Great characters, good history, tragedies of war etc. What I will say is that the ending must have been written by someone else. It came straight from daytime TV or Three's Company--a misunderstanding that leads to personal tragedy could have VERY easily been avoided. Given the fact that Corelli's character was so gregarious and open minded for 90% of the book, the ending doesn't fit.Also, there are three or four chapters early in the book that have absolutely no bearing later on."
5,Excellent,excellent source for future parents of Chinese adopted children or for the children themselves! I do not know of any other source of information going so deep into the history and facts about Chinese foundlings
3,Tortelvis minus bandmates is lacking...,"I wish I could give this more stars, but if you're a fan of the band (and I am!), this CD pales in comparison to the band's earlier work. The band has mostly broken up, and lead singer Tortelvis (with a couple of original band members) goes through some ""classics"" without the great sound and fun the original band created. It all just sounds too weak, and feels like a quickie album produced for some extra cash. This CD shows the band as the novelty act they never wanted to become. Don't get me wrong, it's a fun album... but if you're not familiar with Dread Zep, stick with Un-Led-Ed or 5,000,000... Now those are classics!"
4,Chaney Clock/Thermometer,"After several months this product continues to work well. One minor, fixable flaw is the temperature mechanism box on the back rotates causing the reading on the front to be inaccurate. You need to read the temperature on another thermometer and then rotate the box on the back until the temperature on the front is correct. I suggest the manufacturer set the proper temperature in the factory and glue the box in place, so it does not move. But, overall, we are very pleased with the purchase."
3,Keeps poor time,I have this clock/thermometer on an outdoor patio under shelter. The thermometer seems to be accurate however the clock looses 5+ minutes weekly. I have a number of AA battery powered clocks and this one is the only one that doesn't keep time accurately.I should add the appearance is good and otherwise looks to be well constructed.
1,Disappointed Overall,"Truck is fine but trailer is cheaply made. It was broke when we received it. We got a replacement and that was cheap and broke within 5 minutes of having it, by an adult showing the child how to use it. Great idea if it was made better. I have a very disappointed nephew."
3,Jacaranda Bedding,"Ok, first of all the bedding is VERY nice. The company that I got it through has problems. First they sent me the wrong set. When I emailed them telling me they apologized and said they were sending out the right set right away. A day or two later they email me again and told me I had to print off some packing slip and either take the bedding to a FedEx location or schedule a home pick up before I could get my new set. I was a little annoyed with that."
1,Not Impressed,The promoters of this publication participate in illegal unsolicited email practices (ie. 'spam').Great way to piss off potential customers.
1,spam,I got a spam e-mail advertising this book. This does not inspire me with confidence in the author's credibility.
4,Better for older kids,"I found this game to not have enough action. My kids (4 and 7) love action and racing, etc. This game had matching games and cells, etc. Boring for a young kid that just wants to see Superman fight the bad guys and fly - alot. There is that option but it gets old fast."
2,"Enzo Stuarti, NOT Mario Lanza!!!!!","The singer on this CD is Enzo Stuarti, NOT the Great Mario Lanza!!! It is a tribute to Lanza, recorded by Stuarti in the early 1960's, a few years after Lanza's untimely death in 1959. It was originally on a budget (99 cents) LP on the Spinorama label. Stuarti was OK, but he was a far cry from the one and only Lanza!! No one could begin to compare with Lanza - not then and not now!! If you're going to release a tribute to Lanza - SAY SO!! And identify the singer singing it!! ...You can't fool all the people all the time!!! ...Thank You. Amen..."
1,Hollow people,"Boy, what a worthless book on brown nose techniques. One idea that is plain garbage is that if you do lots for other people they will pay back in kind by 2 to 10 fold. What garbage. Please do not waste your money on this book. I cannot believe the nonsense. After you give all you got to people after they see you have nothing left they will just move on. Boy, are these writers living in a dream world? It is a book about suck up that will just make you look like a fool. If I used most of their methods I would be a laughing stock at work. Those who exceed step on other faces, that is how it really works. My rating is really a minus 10 stars but they do not have that rating available. If I could I would return the book but it is probabbly better I burn it so there is one less copy available for some simple minded soul to read. If you want to be exploited and left holding the bag then read this book..vramccom"
2,What The Hell ! !,This Game is stupid. They really need to tighten up the graphic a bet. I mean who the hell gets stuck in a fence after being launch 89 feet! of crach too an ivsible wall after being launch 100 feet. the races are frustrating. you have too get a really fast car. there's not that much cars. only one is the fastest. all the good stuff have to be unlocked. And the Bonus games are a total Agrrevasion. Except the High Launch Bonus. If you want this game. I suggest You Rent It! Or Save Your Money!
4,Maybe it's NOT your Patriotic Duty to Vote...,"The premise of this work rests on the idea that voting is simply a way of oppressing those who are disenfranchised either by circumstance or by choice. The author makes some compelling arguments about how low voter turnout creates a system of Rule by the Minority and how election-generated ""mandates"" are the prime tool of the demogogue. It's worth the time to read if you have any anarchist tendencies."
5,A unique and humorous telling of tales drawn from Margie Zats' own life and memories,"Stories From Someone Older Than Television by Margie Zats with illustrations from Jerry Fearing is an eclectic collection of peculiar stories and creative oddities, Including eight fun and tasty recipes. Stories From Someone Older Than Television is a unique and humorous telling of tales drawn from Margie Zats' own life and memories. With a text that is occasionally enhanced with illustrations by cartoonist Jerry Faring, Stories From Someone Older Than Television is very highly recommended to all readers with an interest in funny biographical short-stories -- as well as those with an interest in hearty home-style cooking."
3,.....that place.,"This odyssey attempts to articulate that which quietly is in all of us - the longing to discover and embrace our unique place, individually and collectively, within the boundless whole of space and time. And standing here (the Northern Plains)- amid exquisite beauty (of the earth, of the heavens, of our souls)- can take us ever-so subtly, yet boldly, to that place."
4,Hillbilly humor,"I found Squidbillies one day while clicking through the channels on my set. I knew then and there, I had to own this set.Raw, unapologetic humor. Just what I like.Granted, the first season was a bit hit and miss, it does get better as you go along the series.Just remember not to touch the trim!"
1,I don't even...,Has anyone really been far even as read to chapter 1 even go want to read look more like any?Holy crap!
1,Does not work on my Windows 7 64-bit system,"Too bad, this looked like the best software anywhere in the price range. Unfortunately, they don't advertise which systems for Windows 7 it works on, and if you were planning ahead, and got 64-bit, don't bother buying it. Bummer."
1,Didn't work on our computer bad program,We bought this one and the zoombinis and both didn't work on our computer beware should have know when one didn't work they are both by the same company and many of the reviews said the same thing.
2,Lack of organization,"If you are looking forward to preparing yourself efficiently to try TOEIC avoid this book. It lacks organization, the structure ...actually there is no real structure, by advancing the units you might find some sense however I think people who are trying an english certificate are looking for an efficient and organized book instead of an unrevised awful book."
1,Poor excuse for a comedy,Sex and the Teenage Mind is the epitome of everything bad in a teenage sex comedy. It's like a bad version of Fast Times At Ridgemont High. It's not remotely funny and is just plain annoying. A waste of 90 minutes of your life.
4,MiniFigs Rule The World !,"Caveat - I'm a big Lego fan. I love minifigs and think they're very cool...which is why I love this racing game. To start - lots of fun minifigs to personalize. You have control to change thier clothes, helmets, faces and just about anything else. The same goes for their vehicle. You can either use a ""stock"" pre-made car or build your own. Those wanting to jump right into the game should pick a pre-made car ( you still have a couple of choices ) and start to play. You can spend hours just building your car from scratch - using all the different Lego shapes, colors and sizes. The racing itself is pretty good, too. Lots of different worlds to visit and race in. The handling isn't too tough but it's fun - good for both adults and kids, nothing too complicated. There are save options too, so you won't have to rebuild your minifig drivers and cars each time. It's a fun game, great for the whole family. Best Regards, turtlex."
3,This is a fun game!,"This is a really fun game and the ability to build your car is really cool but the computer drivers are just so good, it gets frustrating. No matter what you do, they are always better than you."
2,works but should come with adapter,This charger works with my Rino 530HCx. The one thing is Garmin should include the snap on adapter with this product. I wish they would tell you that when you buy it. So you always have to bring the one snap on adapter that came with the radio to use it. Disappointed
5,dc,have not used it yet but it was cheap and arrived in perfect condition and am very happy with the total transaction and look forward to my next long trip to use it
3,Vehicle Battery Must Be On to Charge,"This adapter works fine, but only with the vehicle battery turned on. Fine if your driving, but not when your sleeping in your tent...who designs these things? I own a 2011 Jeep Liberty ""Renegade""...maybe it has something to do with current vehicle safety technology, but my 2008 H3 never had this problem. BEWARE, you've been warned."
4,Not a bad deal,"My wife really liked it.Arrived as advertised, works well, looks good. Has been running 2 1/2 years on the original battery. Only complaint is that, after 2 years, the bracelet link ""covers"" began loosening and falling off. Easy enough to fix, but still a pain."
4,My fav. of gould's work,"Excellent story. As some other reviewers mention, he seems to get some crappy editors, as I've noticed the problem in other books as well - some especially have a tendancy to fall into a ""Then this happened, and this happened"", very plot-led interaction.This book is the best at avoiding falling into the trap, but it does have a wonderful steamroll into the ending."
4,Great Story - Eye Candy for plane trips,This is a good read and was hard to put down. I read a lot of Scifi and fantasy and am not so easy to keep hooked to a story any more. gould is a fine writer; I enjoyed his Jumper story and I enjoyed this one even more. Only reason I didnt give it a five is that I can think of a couple other stories that are even better - such as Martin's Game of Thrones.
4,"Enjoyable, casual read",I found the book easy to follow (although a map would have been nice). The characters are great. The setting is basically midieval with some sci-fi thrown in. The story never lags or slows down and ends in a satisfying way. If you enjoyed Card's Homecoming series then you will probably like this book.
2,Not happy with this recipe book.,"I am so unhappy with the recipes. I am trying to sell the book myself, just to get rid of it. There's nothing quick and easy about it. The recipes call for ingredients not available in Michigan."
4,Total Joint,It is nice to get the discounted price but they are slightly expired. They seem to be working okay still.
1,2007 Quicken Deluxe,"For 2007 Quicken - Intuit no longers supports electronic linking to your financial accounts. As far as I'm concerned, this is a major drawback. I ended up buying 2010 Quicken and scraping 2007.The seller did his job so I have no issues with them. Buyer beware."
5,Ghost Whisper,"Love this show. Have all seasons, wish there were mroe. The case that holds each CD is made rather cheaply, they don't stay but I use paper towel to protect them inside case. But I would buy it again anyway."
2,"Stylish penny-dreadful,more polished than most.",From its title you might think that this horror flick emanated from PRC or Monogram. It benefits however from good performances by David Bruce and George Zucco. Zucco who was very suave and authorative but given now and then to over the top haminess delivers a performance of admirable restraint and perception. Turhan Bey (before his romps with Maria Montez) has a minor role but plays it in his best continental style. The plot itself has many gory details but fortunately nearly all of them are off camera. What a bloodbath would ensue if the film were being made today. 21/2 stars.
4,Remains True To The Essence Of The Story,"First of all, be sure to read the John Knowles book first. It always helps to do so before watching a film adaptation of a classic story. As for the movie itself, most of it remains true to the novel. Considering it was shot around 2003, the teleplay remains truer to patriotism as opposed to the written version. (Listen to the stories of your grandfathers and uncles. Who would dare speak out against fighting in World War II? Or the conflicts in the present day Middle East?) A few of the circumstances were altered because to reflect this aspect, but, nothing so drastic that the root of the story is changed. The movie is well acted and paced. Every scene pertaining to the main plot is included. I highly recommend ""A Separate Peace"" to anyone who's in doubt."
4,Well acted rendition,Not a totally accurate presentation of the book but a fine job portraying the characters. Some unnecessary language added. I doubt many teens were dropping the F bomb in the WWII era.
3,"Ill Beats Bad mc, 3 Stars for Madlib","I bought this cd because I saw that Madlib produced it. However, I think that Madlib wasted some of his best beats on Dudley. His voice gets in the way. His repetitive statements are nauseating. This album is only good after smoking a blunt to the face. Music should not require drugs"
2,Light!,"The author has a habit of making Jane's thoughts sound as though she's speaking them. Then says that of course she didn't say that. Once in awhile would be okay, but all the time is just too much."
2,Are these people reading the same book??,"I dunno, I found this book to be dreadful. The writer does have a grip on the low-rent sitcom world, but the writing is awful, the lead character is cloying, and the ""solution"" is beyond ridiculous..."
4,Better than 900 Mhz,The Koss Cordless headphones are clear and don't have the hissing and spitting that the 900 Mhz headphones I had tried previously. For me the clear sound of the Koss infrared clearly outweighed the limitation of losing sound when out of the room of the transmitter.
4,"Lotta Verbs, Lotta Serge, Lotta Laughs",Serge is a wonderful character. One can't help wonder what would happen if Serge met Skink.
2,Like a moth tied to a bottle rocket.,"You have to hand it to Tim Dorsey, he's funny and creative. That, and the nervous, almost amphetamine quickness of the plot, are the only things I enjoyed about this novel.In it, we meet two stoned nymphomaniacs; a DJ with the personality of Jabba the Hutt; inept law enforcement officers from a bridge patrolman to undercover FBI; a dog passing for a meteorologist; and a thoroughly insane traveler who has recently stopped keeping track of his meds.It reads that way, too, like a neon-colored collage of misfits crossing paths nearly at random like mosquitoes splatting on windshields. I could see how someone would enjoy this type of read, perhaps if stoned, but it wasn't for me."
4,Good follow-up to Florida Roadkill,"I enjoyed this book almost as much as Florida Roadkill. About the only difference was that with Florida Roadkill, I was pleasantly surprised that I liked it som much. Serge is back, chasing the money that was the focus of the first book, but again gets sidetracked in many other funny situations. The characters are well done, the plot is a little hard to follow at times, but always tied together very nicely. I would recommend this for anyone who enjoyed Florida Roadkill. If you haven't read Florida Roadkill, I would recommend it as well."
4,A soundtrack not to be overlooked,"I saw 'Short Cuts' a year or two after its release, but didn't encounter the soundtrack until the late 90's. I wasn't too into Jazz at that point and I will admit sacrilegiously I didn't know who Annie Ross was. I enjoyed her ""duet"" with Iggy Pop on 'Evil California.' Fast forward several years and I happily enjoy Ms. Ross's work regularly. I searched, purchased for a very sub-nominal price, and quickly received the CD. I won't bother with the track by track, but here are some general comments. Highlights for me include 'Imitation of a Kiss,' 'To Hell with Love' and the aforementioned duet. The other Jazz tracks are atmospheric, not bad to put on if you are just sitting around, especially at night. The Cello pieces are a little uneven, but this is a soundtrack, so I wasn't expecting stringent uniformity."
4,Met Meager Expectations,"I marginally recommend the movie.The movie's premise is far fetched, but writers and actors do what they can with it. A gangster keeps a man captive like a vicious attack dog. Li's character, Danny, is leashed during the day and caged at night. When the leash comes off, he is preconditioned to attack anything Hoskins tells him to. The driving force in this movie is how Jet Li's character becomes human again. Jet Li is starting to show some emotional range. His humility, which allows him to play dumb and silly, serves him well here. His charisma really shines through. The fights scenes are very good. The ferocious intensity he displays during the fight scenes early in the movie is incredible. The skill he shows in the last fight scenes is impressive.Freeman and Hoskins are very good. The dialog is okay. The sets and backgrounds are good. The movie met my meager expectations and I enjoyed it."
2,"not sure why but would not play, computer cannot read disc","I was hoping to get this and did even though by the time it got here it dropped almost another dollar in price, but computer, blue ray or dvd player all 2010 models fairly new, none of them would or could play this disc computer could not read it at all also new."
4,Love this movie,"This is an interesting movie, because unlike other Kung-Fu movies, Jet Li fights much more dirty. Jet Li will maul his opponents as opposed to temporarily immobilizing one then going to another, he will attack one, and keep beating him until another opponent attacks him. Very dog like, very good."
5,Great Movie,"Unleashed is about Danny(Jet Li) who works for a crime boss and does not know his past. Eventually Danny comes across things that help him to remember his past and must stop the crime boss that he used to work for. The story was presented well and was dramatic. The sound effects were pretty realistic. The action scenes were choreographed well, you will surely be entertained by them. So if you like Jet Li and action movies then you must get Unleashed."
4,Get 'Em,"This is a solid action film. The fight scenes are amazingly choreographed and the locales used for shooting the movie are gritty and grimey and add to the ""doglike"" existence that Danny has been confined to.This movie really allowed Jet Li to display his acting skills. He gives a heartfelt performance as a man who has been conditioned to hurt people on command by a wannabe Godfather-type gangster. He shares some very touching scenes with Sam (Morgan Freeman) and his step-daughter, played by Kerry Condon. Good action, good drama and solid acting makes this a worthwhile movie.The Bonus Material includes a few featurettes, a video by Massive Attack and a miserable video by the RZA. Other than the RZA's weak contribution, the bonus features are very entertaining, providing extensive insight into the development of the film."
4,Hey.. he's getting better,"I'm usually the last person to say something good for Icey. In the past, his mixing has been terrible, track production boring and the like. But with this new release, he ventures into areas he previously ignored, playing a mix of nuskool and hard funky electro along side his signature funky breaks. Ranks right next to his Essential Mix as the best thing he's ever done..... not perfect, but he's getting better."
4,A Good Read!,"Joe Torre distills his management and ""team player"" philosophy into twelve keys. These insights elegantly deal with ways to inspire critical qualities, including trust, commitment, optimism, resilience, excellence, patience, integrity, respect, leadership, teamwork, and camaraderie. Torre illustrates his beliefs and advice with pertinent anecdotes told in a detailed, witty, heartfelt style. Torre, who has won four world series titles as manager of the New York Yankees, draws on his experiences as a player, manager, and leader. He includes the lessons he learned when he reported to a demanding team owner. The book delivers what it promises and offers an engaging behind-the-scenes look at professional baseball. We [...] recommend this book to executives, managers and employees at all levels in any kind of business. Since it never relies on macho clichés, both men and women will find it satisfying and worthwhile."
4,Not an average Joe,"I've only heard audio portions of this book so far and I've enjoyed it immensely. I'm a huge Yankee fan and I love the way Joe manages them - and George Steinbrenner for that matter; calm, clear, focused, patient. However, I just wanted to respond to Bill from NY, who said that Joe Torre can not write and that the book wasn't very ""inciteful"".Note to Bill: buy a dictionary before you ""right"" off a review in haste."
4,Keeps my 2 yr old entertained,my 2 year old loves this! i would rate it better if it were easier for her to insert the cartridges and if the books were more durable (like the little leaptouch books) but otherwise it's a great toy.
2,Writer Loses Focus,"I bought this book because I want to incorporate innovative ideas and special traditions into my wedding ceremony. This book offers irrelevant information like, ""A photographer or videographer can record the event for you so you can relive the memories. If there is a reception afterwards, you will need to hire a caterer.""I didn't buy this to be a wedding planner. I bought it to be inspirational. It tried to do too much and misses the mark on the subject that it's supposed to be about. If the author had posted the title above their keyboard, we might have a book worth reading now."
2,Full of errors,This book has a lot of errors. Not only typos but math errors as well both in the text and the solutions manual. This is very frustrating. I'm switching to Casella's text.
5,quick,I order this book and got it the very next day. I was glad that my professor allowed the old edition and all in all i am picking things up well even though he teaches from the new one.
2,Dissapointed in this for the Kindle PC,"I just purchased this for the Kindle PC app and am very dissappinted. I just started a MAR program and thought the charts would be helpful. Unfortunately they are so small that I can't read them. You can't print them or magnify them. You can magnify text but not the charts. I would think the charts could have easily been sized to a full page each but every one I've tried to look at so far has been about a 1/4 page at most and it's very frustrating. I think the information would be good in printer. There are a lot of detailed charts, but not good for the Kindle PC. I haven't purchased a Kindle yet so this may work better on the actual Kindle device over a PC. I wouldn't recommend this if you're trying to view it on your computer."
1,Not very accurate or detailed,"I would not recommend this book to anyone who truly believes the Bible.It is full of errors. It embraces evolution time lines, doubts the accuracy of the bible, and truly mixes up where the true church comes from. Please check it out for yourself before you buy."
3,Pretty Useful,"This book is an unusually complete guide to living as an expatriate in Abu Dhabi. I sort of wondered about the guide's objectivity due to the advertisements bound in the book. Still, it answered most of the questions I had, and I ultimately decided not to move there."
5,Best Service on the internet,"Fast, effecient, and good quality product.Definitely would buy from here again.No problems, no issues. :)Please consider them before your purchase anywhere else."
4,Great overview,This book gave us a great overview about the Shar Pei breed and discussed all the conditions we need to be aware of if we become a Shar Pei owner. I was most concerned about the eye and skin conditions. The author gives details about both and how to avoid problems. I have been talking to several breeders and our puppy may be born in the next several weeks. My only criticism is that the photos appeared to be of the same puppies and dogs over and over. I would hve liked photos of additional Shar Pei!
1,ultimately naive and silly,"This book is, ultimately, a naive and silly approach to a serious subject. I am afraid that the author comes too late to the game and brings too little. Worth a miss."
5,Self esteem booster for kids,"This video teaches neat tricks that kids age four to fourteen will be able to do. Rope around the world is full of interesting scenes the kids can watch while they practice to the music. After a brief ""how-to,"" the child has time to practice before the next trick is introduced. Jump rope is an excellent (and inexpensive) way to develop motor skills, and it is good work out which disguises itself as play. My daughter, age 8, loves it."
3,Koss Has Balls Asking This Price For These Headphones!,"Ok lets face it, wireless headphones certainly haven't been perfected yet and any wireless headphones that operate on radio frequency (like these headphones) are going to have some kind of hissing and reception noise but I expected a little more at this price from Koss considering they're suppose to be state of the art in headphones! For Koss to have the balls to ask $300.00 (at Koss.com $400.00) for these is totally ridiculous! These wireless headphones are no better than wireless headphones that cost anywhere between $50.00 - $100.00. The sound quality is a little better than cheaper wireless headphones but what sinks these is the reception. I don't recommend these for this price, it's a total rip off! The only benefit to owning these is the lifetime warranty."
4,Is this classic lex luger..I DONT KNOW!!!,"This is the classic lex luger with his clash of the titan, champions i dont even know what its called, whats it called?.. Can amazon ship even ship this classic figure by next tuesday.....I DONT KNOW!!! Ahhh , and the plastic the figure is encrusted in is too TIGHT BILLY!!! GOD!"
5,Says Much about Historical Memory,"Osagie's book fills a lacunae in the Amsitad historiographic record, but not only for providing details of the Amistad survivors' African return. She provided us with some insights into historical recollections and how they really only exist for present day agendas. She describes the appropriation of the Amistad story by Sierra Leoneans today in order to provide some morale for a society that has lurched from colonial exploitation to home grown exploitation and finally vicious civil war. Quite correctly she has departed from the American-centric purview and focused on the ramifications for African Americans and especially Africans."
2,Not very helpful,"This video is an old one and while informative, it spends too much time ""advertising"" Clark customization. I don't think a newbie to the 1911 will learn enough from this video to be comfortable with stripping down his handgun. I learned far more from STI's computer generated take down and reassembly sequence."
2,"Interesting, but twisted and a bit nonsensical","Make no mistake about it -- Dorsey can keep you interested. I just found myself so appalled by the off-the-wall plot twists and gratuitous violence that I couldn't justify more than 2 stars.Serge is a compelling character, and Dorsey does an elegant job of weaving a dozen or so characters' stories together in this novel. In the process of putting the story together, you get a pretty unappealing look at people in Florida -- homicidal self-serving maniacs dominate the story. At the end of the day I found myself wanting a little more explanation for one homicidal rage in particular (I won't spoil the ending by giving details here).Side note -- I picked this book up because I liked the cover of Torpedo Juice (his latest) and I wanted to start from the beginning. I'm pretty sure I can't stomach another one like this."
5,You'll be amazed at what you laugh at,"Florida Roadkill is a hilarious tale of sex, drugs, money, violence and, of course, rock 'n roll. The schizo antihero, Serge Storms, and about 14 other whackos are on their own roadtrips through Florida, headed south. The fast-paced plot exaggerates actual news events, tying them together on the way to the 7th game of the World Series in Miami. I laughed out loud and couldn't put it down. Tim Dorsey is twisted, delightfully so. I salivate for more. Serge lives!"
4,New to Dorsey - It was enjoyable!,"This was my first book by Tim Dorsey--recommended reading by a friend that lives in Florida. I did enjoy the book but did have a little difficulty keeping up with the introduction of so many characters and then trying to recall them when reintroduced. It all comes together but I did have to look back on occasion to recall the character and their initial role. In my case it was just too much jumping around at times.I did find the book hilarious and was laughing out loud at times. Dorsey certainly has a quirky way of telling a story. Plenty of murder, violence and chaos throughout and intertwined with a good amount of humor. I love the character names--not a bit boring. I will read the next book in the series. I'm not sure I am ready to add Dorsey to my favorite author list but I am drawn to the next book."
2,Disturbing view of Florida,"I bought this book hoping to read a crime mystery novel with Florida sites and history involved. After finishing the book, I felt sick. Dorsey paints a picture of Florida that would drive every sightseer out of the state. He kills off characters and bystanders with the flick of his pencil. Drugs, sex, and murder are commonplace in every characters story. As a resident of Florida, I have been to many places in the novel and have yet to encounter any of the types of people Dorsey created. The tempo of the book is that of a NASCAR race with setting changes mid-sentence. Characters who appear throughout the book are killed off in one sentence like they never existed. I hope Dorsey does not believe he lives in the Florida that he depicts in this stomach turning novel."
3,"sometimes fun, fast-paced, but not a must-read","I checked this book out based on a review I saw featured on Amazon.com. I thought it would be a richly written mystery, and funny also. It is funny sometimes, and fast-paced, but it is also under-written to the point that it's hard to differentiate between characters or care what they do. Maybe I'm under-read, and it's a fault on my part that I like to be able to picture main characters, or maybe that's part of the fatalistic negativity of the book, but even though it was a fun read, I think I could have spent my time better"
1,Terrible Terrible Novel,"If you think that WWF is good drama with interesting characters than this book is for you. There is barely a semblance of a plot, the characters are not developed beyond any stereotype of good vs. bad, and the book seems to exist in order to describe very very non-creative ways to kill people. With a tag line of ""There are only two good guys and one of them is {gasp} a lawyer."" this author is obviously pandering to the lowest most uneducated group of American culture."
2,Not as good as I expected...,"I bought this believing the hype written on the jacket that said Dorsey's writing was akin to Carl Hiaasen's. While he tries hard to deliver the off-the-wall type of mystery, characters, and suspense that Hiassen does, he falls too short, and only succeeds in delivering a type of madcap plot so complicated with so many different characters you find yourself going back chapters to try and figure out how these people fit together. The loose ends are not tied up at the end, and you are left feeling a ""HUH?"" that makes it not worth reading. His delivery is heavy on the crass and light on wit and wryness that is characteristic of Hiaasen. This will be the last Dorsey I read. Yuck."
2,Not in the same league,"Tim Dorsey's ""Florida Road Kill"" doesn't belong in the same league, or even bookshelf, as Carl Hiaasen, Lawrence Shames, James Hall, Jimmy Buffett and Randy Wayne White. These guys really know how to delve into the Florida psyche. Dorsey has used all of the crazy Florida eco-terrorist/politico/bimbo/fisherman/hunter/tourist stereotype plot lines, most borrowed from the above authors, in one single book. What you get is a confusing story with a lot of gratuitous violence and bloodshed thrown in. You don't even care what happens to the main characters. Yes, there are some funny parts, which is why this didn't get the dreaded one-star rating. My advice? Throw this one out and start with ""Double Whammy"" or ""Welcome to Paradise"". Lots better story telling with a lot less blood and guts. You might even want to visit Florida after that!"
3,Inferior to other products.,"Nice style, better than a metal cup, doesn't work as well as the higher end glasses. For its price it performs OK."
2,Nice looking but VERY fragile.,"I suppose I should have been clued in when the first shipment arrived as a box full of shattered glass. I purchased eight of these glasses about six months ago and I am now down to three. Simply knocking one over on its side (which is very easy when full, as they have a very high center of mass) causes the glass to shatter."
5,great looking beer glasses,"Very happy with this purchase, I bought the first 4 glasses two months ago from Macy's, now I have ordered more (since the price went down). Beautiful glasses, I clean them easily, no problems so far."
1,flimsy,"It doesn't feel like glass, more like plastic, one of them had a hole in the bottom and the inner wall/space in the glass got filled up with soap water when I put it in the dishwasher which wouldn't come back out! But I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Better Choices of Mullin's Collection,Don't think this review is against Rich Mullins. I really enjoy his music and was looking forward to this album. I am disappointed that Step by Step isn't the original version and is a version with bagpipes. The sound quality didn't sound on par with the songs that I am familiar with. Just beware that there may be better choices of Rich Mullin's collections if you are a fan.
4,Howard Tate atlantic LP,"A must for fans of late 60's soul! Howard Tate is a powerful southern-style soul singer who ranks amoung the best. This is a very good lp featuring Howards great vocals, Jerry Ragovoy's (janis Jolpin, etc) writing and arranging as well as top notch Atlantic studio band session work. A HEAVY record!"
3,"Great book, Bad CD-Rom","This book has some great information in it and it could stand alone very easily on its content. The CD-ROM, however, needs work. It is nearly impossible to install since it continually prompts you to install QuickTime 6.0, even if you already have it! The CD-ROM also requires you to turn off all of your virus protection to use it. I give the actual book a B+ and the CD-ROM a grade of D-.Please let your instructor know of the CD-ROM issues so complaints can be filed with the publisher to get this fixed."
1,Terrible Sound Quality,"I bought these Koss earbuds because they looked like some other Koss earbuds that I had purchased several years ago that I liked a lot. Unfortunately, while the old ones had good sound quality, these don't. To call the sound ""Tinny"" is an understatement. I thought about giving them away, but I couldn't think of anyone who would want to listen to such poor sound. I threw them away."
1,Man these Bite!,"These are the worst headphones ever. Do not buy! They pop out on a consistent basis (on my 30 minute commute to work on average they pop out, usually out of one ear, 3-4 times). So I'm constantly trying to reinsert them, very troublesome on a subway. I think it's due to the foamy nature of the replaceable plugs. They do not conform to you ear's structure and thus gradually expand over time."
4,Subwoofer in your head,"Greatly enhance deep bass perception. Very comfortable fit. Balanced sound. Come with an extra set of silicon ear plugs. Potential problems: Not too good with treble highs. I recommend that you get it only if your portable device has a minimum 5-band equalizer or if you're not a treble fanatic. Also, the silicon plugs look like they might not last very long, but that's just speculation on my part since I've only had them for a few days. Finally, it insulates from all ambient sounds, so if hearing sounds around you while listening to your portable player is important, then you should consider another design."
2,Not good for shallow ears also,"You'll see people reference in the reviews whether they have small ears or big ears and whether an ear plug style headphone works for them. Now try the reference of ""shallow ears"".I have tried now several brands of an ear plug headphone and I just can't get one to stay in my ears.The foamy material is great and does mold easily. But eventually the foam tries to expand back to its original shape and thus pops out of my ears.So no fault of the product, my ears must be too shallow for the ear plug's foam to really fill in the holes on the side of my head.So it's back to an over-the-ear clip headphones."
2,quality review,"First off the product was not very expensive so i knew what i was paying for. The sound quality was just fine for what i am using them for, but they are not very comfortable. other than that i have no complaints."
2,If you are an a budget and don't plan to be mobile...,"These are probably the best units in the $12 range. The sound is pretty decent for the price IF IF you get them inserted and postioned correctly. If they are slightly out of perfect insertion (easy to do), either bass or highs will suffer. With that said, I really encourage you to wait until you can save up for something better. As I said, it is a hassle to get a good insertion/fit with these (the pinch/roll/wait for expansion thing is not quick). Once you do, you don't want to move around because they will shift and/or fall out very easily in my experience. This last point is a deal killer for me. Save up $20 more and go with the Sony EX81L if you are on a budget or look at the Shure line if you have money to burn."
1,don't bother!,"First of all, the logistics. It takes some intense acrobatics to get these things in your ear. They're definitely not something you want to slip on and off too frequently, and they do collect earwax. Soundwise, while the ""plug"" technique does create impressive bass (although not a very crisp sound, just brute), there is a serious lack of balance in the sound. The upper frequencies are tinny and bland. Save your money and get something better. This is just a gimmick."
3,An average cheap earplug,"I just bought this KOSS The Plug few days before. And intended to use it with my newly bought iAUDIO M3L DAP.I also own an old SONY EX71 earplug, too.First thing I noticed about the plug, is the extremely difficult to wear it. The foam itself is good but once they are in your ear canal, they want to get out, inch by an inch.The sound quality is very sensitive by how you wear the plug. If you wear then just slightly wrong, the whole sound is gone.Second thing I noticed is the high bloated bass. I read many places that the SONY EX71 actually has a very muddy and unclear bass that so overwhelming. But, the plug has EVEN MORE bass than my EX71. It is even more muddy than EX71, because it is TOO CLOSE to ear drum.Mids and Highs are little bit weaker than my EX71.In a conclusion, this earphone is not bad for it's price. But if you are looking for good quality earphone/canalphone, just don't buy it."
5,Longtime user. Best bang for your buck.,"I've been using this model for about 7 years. I originally bought a pair while looking for something with isolation characteristics. Right away I was amazed with the low-end response. As a drummer I've used them primarily in a praise and worship band with in-ear monitoring. You can get better quality but you've got to spend 100's of dollars on something from Shure, Sennheiser or the like. If I was playing several times a week I'd spend the extra money on something like that but not as a casual musician. The expanding foam is what makes the difference. This makes them great also for listening while mowing the lawn or driving the tractor. I needed an extra pair once as I had misplaced mine and couldn't find them locally. Instead I paid $50.00 for a pair of Sony in-ears that to this day I still don't use. The sound from them was thin and unremarkable and they don't isolate. I'll take these cheap ""Plugs"" anyday."
3,They're ok,"I bought this from amazon based on the great reviews this product got. The volume on this thing is great. It blows away those crappy white earbuds that come with the ipod. However, whenever I have to stick these in my ears for an extended period of time my ears begin to hurt. This never happened with those ipod earbuds. Secondly, the cord is too long and gets tangled up rather easily.In summary, these are a great value for sound but they have the potential to hurt your ears. The ""plug"" doesn't cost a lot so if you want to risk $12 on a decent pair of cheap headphones go right ahead."
2,Muddy bass,"Positive aspects: Does stay in your ears, affordableNegative aspects: *MUDDY* bass, unbalanced soundOVERALL: Not recommended."
1,A potentally dangerous waste of money,"These things are terrible. If - IF - you can get them to stay in your ear, you'll get good bass but not much else. Getting them to stay in your ear is the major challenge, of course. And the sharp plastic tube which conducts the music can easily and painfully poke through the foam and scrape the inside of your ear. Avoid them at all costs."
1,"Decent fit, but TERRIBLE sound.","I bought these because my wife has trouble getting regular earbuds to stay put when she goes jogging. For the most part, they fit nice, but you have to know how to insert them properly. I roll them between my thumb and finger so that they are long as skinny, then insert them into my ear and wait for them to expand... just like putting in foam earplugs. For me, they fit well, and seem like they'd stay in better than the rubber-tipped earbuds.It's a shame they sound like a Hallmark musical greeting card playing inside a tin coffee can. These are bargain basement earbuds, so I certainly wasn't expecting them to sound like Sennheiser headphones, but I did expect them to at least match the sound quality of my off-brand earbuds that I got for like a dollar and a half on some Chinese *ahem* ""extreme deal"" website. They don't. The bass is just non-existant. For something that isolates the air inside your ear canal, bass should be its strong point."
5,Great for little ears,These are the first in-ear headphones I have found that fit my really little ears. I have tested them for up to 1-1/2 hours and they stay put and comfortable. In cold weather I suggest you put them in your ears when you are inside; they comform to your ears more easily when they are warm. I only wish they came with a small storage bag.
5,"Tried super expensive product, found these better!","I kid you not. Decided to splurge (over $300) on a super set of earphones for my ipod from Shure and hated them and sent them back. Then I tried these as a temporary solution and found them actually vastly superior in sound, aesthetics and discrete form. I simply love them. As a frequent traveller, I appreciate not hearing the usual yada yada on the airplane. Highly recommend them."
4,Excellent Buds but typo in spec.,These headphones give excellent sound quality and are most comfortable. They remain engaged much better than rigid versions and shut out ambient noise very well. Overall a really good buy.But the Amazon specification indicates and 8' cord.NOT. The cord is only 4' - beware.
3,Fragile,"Very cheap earphones, I'm not an audiophile so I don't mind the quality, but mine started to lose sound on one side after a couple months"
4,not too shabby,"These obviously aren't the most expensive earplugs but for the money they are pretty good. The bass is OK and sound quality is better than you'd expect. They are fairly comfortable and would, I suspect, fit most ears with the foam plug. This is my second pair and the first ones lasted maybe six months of pretty hard wear. I would recommend them."
2,No comparison to the slightly more expensive Sony Fontopia line,"I bought these as a potential replacement for my Sony MDR-EX51 ear buds (they've lasted around a year and a half). I can best describe these as foam ear plugs with small holes hollowed out, attached to mediocre ear buds. They fit in my ear fine, but they were uncomfortable, and the hole is so small that every time I moved my jaw the hole changed shape and the sound level decreased. Moreover, there is a small plastic tube through the hole that is supposed to assist the cushions in attaching to the sound mechanism itself, but they are fickle and I found that mine quickly (within around 5 minutes) were misaligned so that the cushion part did not fit snugly. I'm not a brand snob at all, but do yourself a favor and get the Sony ear buds because it's definitely worth it."
2,The Plug by Koss,"I found these to be a waste of money and time. They didn't stay in my ears, I have very small ears, no matter how I tried I could not get them to fit properly, even the smallest cushion caused discomfort. The only thing they have going for them is that they are cute."
2,"More comfort, less sound quality.","I ordered these to replace the uncomfortable earbuds that came with my ipod. Yes they are more comfortable but where the the treble go? Where are the subtile nuiances of songs that I could hear with my ipod earpieces? I heard aspects of songs with my ipod earbuds that I hadn't known existed even on the most expensive home systems. Help! Ipod's hurt, fall out. But I'll put up with pain to get quality sound. (Pardon the spelling)"
4,Review of Gurdjieff A Beginner's Guide,"I just finished reading Gil Friedman's book Gurdjieff A Beginner's Guide and found it to be very useful and practical. Having studied Gurdjieff material for the last two years I found this book useful in condensing some of the day to day suggestions for changing your being. I recommend it to anyone curious about the work or for those who have been in it for awhile and would like a succinct perspective on the Ouspensky side of things. I already have used many of the ideas conveyed in the book and read parts of it to one of my relatives who can no longer see well enough to read on his own now. At the end of the book there were some misspellings of other author's names (C.S. Nott, not Natt and Wilhem Nyland, not William Niland)."
2,Megatron's in the house,"Long ago, I purchased Megatron for 39 dollars. I didn't know, it was not in Toysrus. He had a tank for a weapon. It included a missile and Energon sword. White, green, blue, light blue, black, orange, and purple makes it a nice touch. It is pretty cool. In robot mode, his antennae stands so it will look just like the cartoon. His legs go flip-flap if you want the rest of his feet to appear. It is cool, though. Dude, I hope this reading was helpful. Don't waste your time on me! kel23692fkekmd"
4,Caution!,"I was looking for a pair of high end headphones that I could wear during my day at work. Obviously, the main requirement was to keep all the music to myself. These headphones have great sound, HOWEVER it has speakers on the outside too! These speakers are not terribly loud on the outside, but are definitely not fit for situations in which you don't want others to be disturbed by your music. I didn't see any mention of this in the specifications, so you should definitely take this into account before you make a purchase."
2,Nice sound; flimsy construction; poor customer service,"The A250 phones provide pleasant sound quality, but I regret to report that their construction can be flimsy and Koss customer service seems to be nonexistent. I had gotten 15 and 20 years of flawless service from my previous two sets of earphones before I purchased the A250 phones. Within two months of gentle usage listening to chamber music at modest levels, an intermittent contact developed in the stereo jack. After two email inquiries to Koss did not elicit a response, I installed a new connector myself. A spring clip mount for one earphone self-destructed two months later, and a small metal part within the clip disappeared into my carpeting. I had to remount the earphone to the headband using a nut and bolt. Caveat emptor!"
2,unsatisfied customer,I purchased one pair and within two days they fell apart. They were replaced by the company where puchased (amazon) and the same exact thing happened again.
2,Not for a real beginner,This author has a clear way of explaining the full realm of VBA using all Microsoft Office applications. The hard part is that its not really for the ABSOLUTE beginner. Another problem is that through each step of his writing he makes the assumption that you have a specific need for that specific portion of VBA's abilities and then goes on explaining it like your just going to be able to apply it to your personal programming needs. The sad part is that the author took no time to create a hands on approach so that you could understand and self apply. I would go with a different beginners guide.
5,An Effective Book on How to Develop a Plan to Achieve Your Goals,"I am a fanatic with setting goals, prioritizing my time and setting action plans. The author - as a trained Navy Seal - shares his insight and experience in methods to achieve your goals. I first read this book from a library, and liked it enough to purchase it. It sits on my ""Occasionally Read"" shelf, and believe myself as better off after having read it.Considering much of the authors material is based on the training techniques of the US military, I felt it is very sound advice as applied to my work."
5,Unleash the Warrior Within,"Said simply, its awesome. Mack relates military stratagies and techniques to our everyday lives, and gives us stratagies to improve ourselves in whichever ways we should improve. Since nobody's perfect, everbody should read this book; however, its an extra special treat for those of us who are already sheepdogs and understand the talking points."
1,avoid this for now,As of this date (June 2004) the Windows XP USB drivers (updated version 1.1 from the Aiptek web site) for this camera seem troublesome. The Aiptek web site does not offer useful troubleshooting for this relatively new model as of yet. Do not buy this newly released camera at this point.
3,makes great visual appearance,"its looks good, not much more to tell. not much more to tell, not much more to tell, bye bye"
3,Very nice ... But some problems,"Very nice looking ring. Sizing isnt accurate, mine is waaaaaay too big. Tge edges of tge ribg seem sharper than normal but great ring for price"
4,female sleuth,"Wish I'd remembered that I'd already read this, but it was worth a second read. Those freelance jobs can be killers."
5,The New Standard,"Nussbaum and Sunstein have put together something very special. This book mixes the standard animal rights fare of Singer, Wise, and Francione with exciting new contributions by thinkers like Catharine MacKinnon, Richard Posner, as well as Sunstein and Nussbaum themselves. The book is well edited, with the various chapters flowing from issue to issue, and responding to each others arguments. The work explores not only what we own to animals, but also what practical approaches might deliver. The animal rights issue show not merely to be a ""for or against"" issue. Instead, we see a nuanced debate about the place of animals in theory and practice.This book is essential to academic audiences, but should also prove accessible to general audiences. I suspect this will become a standard text for future animal rights courses."
1,EHHH not impressed,"Messy.... I liked the tan, but messy to apply and I didn't like how long it takes to dry. I like to shower and go to bed.. gets on stuff.. bummer... I threw it away..."
3,GOOD INTENTIONS... BUT...,"I enjoyed the Harris men... and actually thought this would be a continuation of that one, since it ends with them finding their father... (hence, Father Found)...It wasnt, but thats neither here nor there. This book was just not that entertaining... Kinda depressing... dark... on the serious side... violent...The message was sincere, but it just didnt make for an entertaining book. Spent the last few chapters skimming through the pages.I found the story with Martin and Debra to be most interesting, but when the subplot switched back to Zale and the main issue at hand, things slowed down.Perhaps if you are someone who wasnt raised by their father, or vice versa, this may touch a chord in you, but to the casual reader, it may be a bit tedious."
4,Heartache...,This is a gritty story that shows the heartache and suffering of many African-American men who grow up without a father in their life.The reader can immediately see the authors intensity and sensitivity weaved into the characters and what a surprising twist at the end!! Good reading. -ES
5,Excellent buy,"This Pulsar quartz watch is an excellent buy for the money. This watch keeps very accurate time and is dependable.A lovely looking watch, not too large or too small for your wrist.I have previously owned a similar looking Pulsar quartz watch and would not buy any thing else. Very pleased with this purchase."
2,ten very interesting minutes; mostly ultra-boring....,"The ten or so minutes showing Hockney painting, are very interesting. The ten or so minutes in art galleries is interesting. Most of the film is a slow motion, pretentious, pseudo-arty bore."
2,Self-indulgent is an understement,"This movie is just awful. I have read the other reviews here. All I can say is, if you appreciate Hockney's work, find a way to really look at it.This certainly isn't it. If you feel you just have to see this because you'll do anything ""Hockney"", do yourself a favor and rent the thing."
2,Good fundamentals but lacks practical approaches,"The book does a good job introducing the fundamental details of Internet based appplication security concepts for B2C and B2B via applications and web services. It also introduces the emerging xml security atandards and little bit of identity management. Beyond that I find it is not much helpful, the book suffers with lack of strategies and implementation details that developers need to build their security mechanisms using Microsoft or J2EE or Open source based platforms. You may find this book useful for concepts but you may need a companion Security reference guide spcific to implementing security with Microsoft .NET or J2EE web services."
3,Was great -- while it worked...,"Was really great while it worked. After 5 months, it no longer holds, it immediately pops off my hair dryer -- won't stay on for nothing. If your dryer is good, it's worth buying a replacement -- I am."
2,Does the job,"This product does the job. I thought it would have individual holders for each, it is just wide open inside."
4,Great Sound & Durability,"These headphones have the sound quality that comes with headphones that sell for twice the price. The earpieces turn flat for easy storage. There is also only one cord. This eliminates the headphones getting tangled around your neck. Great for personal audio, this is a product that is definitely worth purchasing."
4,misleading picture,"The product was exactly as advertised: an audio cable with volume control. However, as the title suggests, the picture was rather misleading. I was in the market for a 90 degree jack, which is what i thought i was getting with this product. Upon opening the Amazon box, i was disappointed to find that the jack did not match the picture. i was considering returning the product for this reason, but soon after discoevered that the angle of the jack did not hinder my purposes. so, except for the fact that the product i purchased did not exactly match the picture, my experience with this product has been nothing but positive."
3,Great till it stops working,I have owned two of these. I love the product till it stops working which it will. Mine lasted longer than the 90 day warranty but both died within a year. The wires start cutting out without any noticeable exterior damage.
5,Very cool mp3 player accessory,"I ride a scooter (aka Vespa) and it is inconvenient to reach the volume control of my mp3 player while I'm riding, so I decided to buy this and so far I'm pleased. I love how I can clip it on my shirt and easily access it. One thing to mention is that it does not amplify sound so it will only go as loud as the music player can go. I believe there is no degradation in sound quality so that is great. Overall I'd recommend it based on my experience."
2,You get what you pay for...,"Purchased to be used to adjust the volume of my Pro 4AAT phones while snoozing at night, the tiny volume control, no balance, and flimsy construction make these useless for me.At $10, not worth the hassle of returning.Koss should not put their name on such a piece of junk. Next time, I'll pay more and buy something better."
3,Not well shielded cable,"If you're using this for headphones, it's probably fine. I was trying to use it as a replacement volume puck for amplified speakers, and the cable is so poorly insulated that all sorts of noise comes through. The volume control is nice and it is very small."
3,what could go wrong with this deal,"it is worth the price paid for it. Nothing extra special to get a higher rating, nothing wrong to get a lower rating."
5,I love this item!,"I had been spoiled by a set of headphones that had the volume control right on the cord. I wear them to sleep and of course wound up breaking them after rolling over on them a few times. I switched to the sleepphones, but they unfortunately do not have a volume control on the cord. I bought this to solve the problem, but wasn't expecting much because it was fairly inexpensive. To my surprise, it works like a charm! I agree with other reviews that it isn't a modifier, it won't produce sound louder than the settings on the main unit. I set my computer to the highest volume and lower it to a comfortable level with this. I've slept on it a few times now and haven't had any problems."
2,Won't boost volume,"Whereas this device will allow you to adjust the volume, the range is limited from no sound to the volume you'd have without it. I had gotten the [apparently mistaken] impression that it would boost the volume for headphones which had low volume for some sources (like Zune, IPod), but that does not appear to be the case. Since you can always lower the volume on the source (mp3 player, etc.), I'm having a hard time seeing the value of this device - except that in some cases it might be handier to have an inline control."
3,Very disappointing,"I saw this movie because I'm a huge Will Ferrell fan. I liked Old School, Elf, Anchorman, and even Kicking and Screaming, but I did not like this film. He's in it, but he's not funny (it's not his fault, though; he wasn't given anything to work with)."
1,One of the worst films I have ever seen.,"Nicole Kidman: ""I'm a witch!""Will Farrel: ""I'm a Clippers fan!""Devoid of laughs or charm, and a complete waste of all the actors involved. The only bright spot in this enormous cinematic turd was the hilarious cameo performance of Steve Carrel, but even that doesn't make this movie worth watching.0/5 stars"
2,What a mess.,"I watched this mess last night and I have to say that I was appalled that this was ever released into the movie theaters.This movie was so painful to watch that I almost turned it off.(One of my friends left during the movie because he couldn't bare it). Will Farrell was more annoying, unfunny and awkward than ever throughout the whole thing. I don't know who keeps casting this guy. (-2 Stars) Nicole Kidman really did what she could to try saving this thing.(2 Stars for Nicole for really looking and playing the part well.)The only highpoints of this debacle where Shirley Maclaine and Michael Caine. Two dreadfully underutilized veteran actors in this film who completely steal the show in every scene they are in. (2 Stars for them) Yet for some reason their story didn't even wrap up in the end, unless I missed it because I fell asleep and didn't realize it. That brings the total to 2 stars, but believe me I am really pushing it here."
2,Chewing the Scenery,"Sometimes a story within a story works, but this time it doesn't.Here we have a real witch, accidentally hired to reprise the roleof Samantha on a new TV version of ""Bewitched."" Nicole Kidmanis a sweetheart who does what she can with a muddled plot. Shereally does remind one of Elizabeth Montgomery, and remains beautiful in her own way. But she can't carry the story by herself. Will Farrell proves to be a much better comedian thana comic actor. His over-the-top scenery-chewing outbursts callfor little sympathy for his character. When sincere, romanticfeelings are required, we just can't believe him. I bought thisone for my wife, but she didn't like it either. I still owe herone for watching ""The Great Raid"" with me."
1,Not worth watching,"Hard to say where this one went wrong, but allowing Will Farrell free reign to chew the scenery was definitely a large mistake. Farrell can be quite good when kept under control but his endless mugging destroyed what little charm this move had. Yes, I know his character was supposed to something of a jerk, but not a complete jerk. And why make him a jerk anyway?By the way, I never had any expectation that this was going to be a remake of the TV series. I knew the plot going in. But the movie simply wasn't done very well."
4,Bewitched,"Bewitched was a great movie. It wasn't the bebst ever but it was good. Towards the end it got a little boring but........ a lot of movies are like that. It was not really like the real show Bewitched but thats ok!Bewitched is focused about a witch (Nicole Kidman) who wants to quit being a witch and wants to have a normal life. Of course she is clueless about having a normal life. When a has-been director wants to make a remake of the famous TV show 'Bewitched' he needs to find the girl who will stay quiet and let him rule the show. He finds the witch and casts her as Samantha in the TV show. The witch then finds herself falling for the director (Will Ferrel) until she figures out the real him, she decides to get back at him whichever way she wants.In conclusion, Bewitched was good but also got boring. I think they could delete all the parts of them dating because it is boring watching them do that."
2,Could Have Been Worse...,"Ok, Nicole Kidman is a fantastic actress and there could not have been a better choice for Samantha, except of course Elizabeth Montgomery. Will Ferrell on the other hand? I don't know about the rest of the moviegoing public, but I've grown weary of him. So many movies in so little time, with so little range, of course he's going to wear thin. Michael Caine is quite good, but aside from a few magical moments, the movie was underwritten, overacted, and sadly underwhelming."
5,Ferrel is the MAN....Kidman is hot.,"Ferrel is the MAN....Kidman is hot, so shut up. This movie is going to be very funny. Critics will hate it, FANS will love it. The end."
1,"Terrible, awful, horrible, wretched, boring!","This movie is not-at-all what it pretends to be. You'd think you'd be getting a humorous re-telling -- something in the spirit of ""The Brady Bunch"" movie perhaps -- think again. This contrived mess features a skeletal plot about a humorless Will Ferrell trying to get a completely unenthusiastic Nicole Kidman to do a new TV show based on ""Bewitched"". Within 10 minutes, one feels that he/she is already fed up with this movie, but willing to give it a chance as I was. Don't give it a chance. It stinks. This movie is terrible. This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life, and let me assure you, I am one serious movie buff. I cannot use the language I want on Amazon to describe this movie, because my review would be censored. Don't waste a dime on this piece of garbage."
4,surprisingly funny film,"I went into this film with very low expectations and walked out pleasantly surprised. The film is a remake of the old Bewitched TV series with a fun little twist on it. Funny that I'm not really a Nicole Kidman fan but she dazzles in this film and really, no one else could have played her part as well. Will Ferrell was just as funny as usual and to be honest I really can't see someone else playing the roll either. This is just one of those funny film that leaves you smiling when it ends. The film is good for the whole family and I would strongly recommend this movie."
4,I was fully entertained,"I think this flick did a nice job in paying tribute to this fantastic TV show (particularly the first four years 1964-1968). It was a nice break from all of the sex, violence, and crap that is being produced these days. I am not a big fan of Nicole, but she lights up the screen and did a great job. I wish they would have cast Jim Carey instead of Will Farrel. I love the quality of the story line and the beautiful colors of the film. Shirley M. was a perfect Endora."
1,just a little late,"This would have been better if it was made a little sooner-when Meg Ryan and Jim Carrey were in their prime. I like Ferrell in most of his movies when he plays the clueless pompous jackass, but for this movie he was a bad choice. Same goes for Kidman, she's a good dramatic actress, but in comedy she falls flat.Ryan and Carrey would have been a better match."
5,"Funny,and Great Movie","I ordered the movie Bewitched,because my wife kept watching bits on our computor,so I could never use our computor,when I needed to.Now she can use our dvd.Out smarted her again."
2,"a movie that took home 3 razzies, worst actor, screenplay and director.","Here is my interpretation of the Hollywood meeting that lead to this movie. ""Alright folks, we have a contract to do a film with Will Ferrell. Anyone have any ideas?"" Dead silence. ""Come on, what's popular right now?"" ""Remaking old TV shows into movies has been done a lot."" ""Good idea, turn on TV Land and see what's on."" Bewitched is playing. ""That will do, we'll cast Will as Darren."" ""But Darren was the straight guy in that show, that's not Will's thing."" ""Good point, we'll have to spin it somehow so Will can just play his usual schtick."" ""Won't that change the dynamic of the show a great deal? That will make it all about Will after all."" ""That gives me an idea for a plot. Get me a screen writer to bang it out for me."""
4,easy to read and helpful,"I was on very restrictive hospital bedrest when I ordered this book. I am now at home on bedrest. When I was emotionally ready this book provided an easy to read, and easy to understand preview of what's ahead for my preemie. The book covers all aspects of life with a preemie - medical practices and terminology, emotional and psychological repercussions for parents and family, and excellent reference resources.Why only 4 stars instead of five? I've known I would have a preemie for months. This book focuses on parents who have preemies unexpectantly."
5,A preemie parent must read,"During the 6 months my 23week preemie was in the NICU, this book was my go-to guide. It describes in clear detail what different NICU concerns and events are, why they happen, and give parents a great starting point to ask their medical staff educated questions, and to clarify things later."
3,When bad things happen to good Jewish people..,"""Skirts"", Mimi Albert's novel about 3 women in Greenwich Village in the early 60s, tells a familiar kind of story: women before they became ""liberated"" could have had limited options, and when young people get exposed to drugs and/or sex, bad things happen. One of the girls has to have a hush-hush abortion, another just goes on a long decline until near the end. The story really didn't grip me, and I felt the author brought nothing new here."
1,Not much learning or adventure here...,"Disappointed, I should have read these reviews first! Although this is listed for ages 2+, I was not happy with my toddler watching a bad-tempered crazed duck have tantrums and try to kill a cow with an axe. A little less violence in a learning video please Disney! Best advice stick with companies focused on producing learning-based products, not just trying to make a quick-buck. My son loves the Leap-Frog Letters DVD. It is fun, very educational and non-violent. I should have bought the next movie in that series instead."
5,Armstrong hits a high C on his typewriter.,"If you like jazz, Armstrong, ""Potato Head Blues,"" or life itself, read this book."
5,This story deals with love and how it heals people.,"I loved this story. The Hero was so compassionate and wonderful. I hope the character of ""Shelan"" has a book of her own. All I can say that this book is ""one in a million!"""
2,Single Layer DVD's,As reported by others the picture quality is not the best.Checking disc 1 on my computer it is only a single layer 4.7Gb disc and as they are packing four episodes on a disc this explains the poor picture quality.Can others please check your copies in a computer as perhaps pirate copies are in circulation as I would expect CBS not to cut such corners and use dual layer 9Gb DVD's.
4,"Wonderful Show , defective disc","Medium is one of my favorite shows , im so upset that it is now being cancelled midway thru season 7. I took off one star because the disc would not play all the shows. I have never had this happen before and reading the policy it states your cannot return movie or tv discs that have been opened so there is no way to exchange it for one that plays all the shows. I bought it brand new at 40 dollars from amazon so it is very disappointing."
1,Not impressed,"These bars taste pretty neutral. The taste won't wow you or anything, but, if you have sensitive teeth, the Agave Nectar may harm them, or cause them to hurt. Agave Nectar, is a syrupy, super sweet sweetener, that's been proven to be as unhealthy as High Fructose Corn Syrup, yet it's the featured sweetener in this bar. Not good.Also, these bars are ROCK hard. When the bars are created, they're pressed so tightly, that you REALLY have to work to chew them. I don't like that. I prefer a bar that's softer, less chewy.These bars are all wrong. The formulation is good, besides the Agave Nectar, but Jay, don't pack the bars so tightly! And Re-Formulate! Put Yacon Root/Tapioca Syrup in it to sweeten. Has prebiotics, minerals, and offers sweetness."
2,CHAD,"This is definetly not what I expected from Mixmaster Mike. Thisalbum is a big contrast compared to ""Anti Theft Device"". I'm not saying I don't like Mike, but I will say that this is more like a Funk Master Comp. I believe that Mike is capable of doing a lot better than this.Could it be the label he is on?"
5,Great DVD,"Get this DVD, it is Jethro Tull in the early days with Clive Bunker, John Evans, Glen Cornick, Martin Barre and Ian Anderson. The band's performance is very raw and energetic. Ian plays a great flute solo and Clive plays one of the best drum solos I have ever heard. Also included is ""The song for Jeffrey"" taken from The Rolling Stones' Rock n Roll Circus. There are also great interviews with Ian. I recommend this DVD to all that are reading this review."
3,Nurture nature!,"Half technical manual and half advice column, this book serves as an explaination as to how the brain develops, and how to best nuture that development. The book divides the human brain into ""trees"", each one branching out into different areas such as emotions, intelligence and creativity.Included in the book are interviews with leading scientists as well as brain-enhancing activities from parents. The premise is that by learning how the brain develops you can best stimuate it's growth. This is an excellent book for all who care for children from infancy through middle school."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I was recommended this book by my cousin. I also read all of the great reviews before I bought it. It was not what I expected. It didn't give many examples of things that you could do to nurture my child's intelligence, creativity or Heathy emotions as the title suggests. Most of the book is very scientific and just talks about how neurons work and the research the author had done. I didn't learn anything new."
1,disappointed,doll was not as nice as the picture. not worth the money. i went out shopping the day before christmas to get something else to give as a gift.
2,Good Cases but not for Treo,"I've used Krusell cases before and loved them, but this particular case wasn't designed very well. The case fits well, but the plastic cover over the top makes it very difficult to use the stylus to press down on the screen. When I took the case off I didn't wanna put it back on, because it makes it so tough to access use the Treo with the stylus. I don't recommend this solution at all unless you want to use it temporarily when your Treo really needs to be protected and not everyday."
1,Yeah right...,"Aside from the glowing and I'm sure not at all paid for by Samsung reviews below, I've been having chronic problems ejecting DVDs from this unit during the month I've had it; tonight proving to be the most entertaining of all with a DVD that is due back at the rental store tomorrow. It also tends to freeze after it's been running for a while; possibly a heat-related problem? The unit does become extremely hot to the touch after about 15 minutes of use. I'm hoping I can find the receipt for this product (it was a wedding gift) and invest in something more reliable, or at least get my money back to pay off the imminent fine at the video store. Avoid this product."
3,Very Political Heavy Satire Compared to Dorsey's Other Novels,A lot more American political satire than Dorsey's other novels made this a little bit less enjoyable for me than his other novels. Serge Storms the reoccurring character in this series plays a really minor word count in Orange Crush. I would recommend reading Florida Roadkill instead or better yet the book written after this which was a prequel to that first book called Triggerfish Twist.
4,"I have no idea how this guy's brain works, but it's one interesting ride","It took me a while to get into this book, but once I did, I inhaled it. The first chapters introduced a lot of characters and background, and I was having a hard time getting into any of the stories. But once they started becoming intertwined, everything broke loose, and it was extremely enjoyable. I'm glad to have found this author and I'm sure that I'll be reading a lot of his stuff in the future. It is a little confusing, which is why I'm only giving it four stars and not five; but overall, it's hilarious."
4,Orange Crush,"Orange Crush is a hoot. A rollercoaster ride through Florida with the incumbent gubernatorial canidate is more satire than novel. The continual flashback's and seemingly spasmodic introduction of the various characters for the first 100 or so pages is disconcerting; but experience in reading Dorsey's books told me he would bring the story and characters together eventually. I have to admit, some of those character names are way over the top, ie Escrow and Pimento...... Serge A. Storms is the most likeable murderous psycotic ever. How long do I have to wait for another book? I am totally addicted!!"
5,I learned to read from this book....,"This is a wonderful book -- I learned how to read from this book when I was 3 years old. I am in my late 30s now and I still remember the ""See See What do I see?"" story (The Monkey and the Bee).The pictures are just fantastic and the first story especially really helped me when I was a child understand the similarities between words and the slight differences (e.g. see, bee, me). All the stories are just delightful.I've been looking for this book for a long time -- a very kind soul from www.whatsthatbook.com was able to identify this book from my description of the ""Monkey and the Bee"" story.Additionally, I would recommend for anybody to read about Leland B. Jacobs, the editor of the book and author of the ""Monkey and the Bee"" story. What an outstanding individual and educator -- it was heartwarming for me to read about his views on education and the kind of person he was. I wish there were more people like him."
1,Not a Quality product,"The Sequeral chew the plastic rings easily to get to the seeds. it didn't take even a month , very disappointing ...they need to replace the plastic rings around the feeding holes with strong metals"
3,"Looks good, limited effectiveness","Let's face it, squirrels are just rats with bushy tails. They can gnaw, thwart, ruin and get into ANYTHING. This feeder is no exception. It only slows them down...a bit. Our PhD squirrels learned how to just push the entire feeder sideways so seed just trails out...this after the weather/squirrel gnawing combo ruined the mechanisms that allowed the holes to close down. It looks pretty. Just don't expect it to be squirrel proof."
1,Initially wonderful- then mechanism not durable,"We purchased this about 2 months ago. The first month it worked flawless. Now- we've had a little rain, and rust is appearing all over- and we have been in a drought. Also, squirrels have interferred with spring squirrel be gone system- so it does not slide properly- partially due to rust- which allows either- a- squirrels to feed or b- birds not able to feed. I would not suggest purchasing it."
2,Is not squirrel proof!,"The feeder is very attractive & looks great in the garden, but it is not squirrel proof. The squirrels hang from the hook and eat the seed. They do not even have to step on the spring-fed perch. My squirrels love this so much, one day I could not find the feeder. I almost thought that someone came into my yard and stole it. I then found it behind a bush. They found out how to remove it from the hook and tried to carry it away."
1,Waste of MONEY!!!!,"So much for keeping out the squirrels, it lasted one whole day before one of them managed to brake one of the plastic ports, that was supposed to close from their weight, will that did not happen!, it just broke out and all the seed fell out, save your money people this is a piece GARBAGE!!!!!"
1,Two Days and Boom!,"Just wish I had read the reviews closer. This feeder was a total bust - big time! Two days after hanging it in the tree, I came home to find it smashed on the ground and unable to do any repairs, as it was cracked on both ends. What a disappointment!!! If I could give no star I would."
4,A lovely story about dog and human healing,"If you love dogs, you will enjoy this book. The dog and the human both experience a healing process. It's touching and an enjoyable read."
3,Good to watch once!,"This is a movie that you can watch once and it won't bore you. It starts well and heightens the expectations, but the sequence of events in between and the ending is average. The fact that this movie does not actually provide a motive for the killing is a major reason why I've taken off 2 of the 5 stars. The 3 boys do a good job of their roles and look far more skilled for their age. All in all, a movie that can be watched once. 3 stars for this one."
3,to much base,.. I like KOSS EARPHONES very much. And this is my second pair.. BUT THIS PAIR JUST HAS TO MUCH BASE. You can't hear any of the high notes. They are very comfortable though. And I will keep using this pair along with my other pair of earphones. I must say my other pair does have a better sound than these (KOSS TD-61 Sterephones) ; and you can hear both the highs and the lows with my other earphones. The other earphones are KOSS EARPHONES also... In all honesty I can't recommend these earphones; and I'm sorry about that. ... Jack
4,A GIFT,"I bought the game as a gift for a friend at work. The game has a few of the older hotels set for implosions in the next couple of years....a remembrance of a piece of history in the Valley, caputured on a board game. Teri"
3,Slow But Surprising,"You may be tempted to go back and watch this film a second time to examine all of the characters more closely. What seems to be a simple prison escape is not. There aren't really any cinematic tricks to make this story look or sound more exciting than it is, but one might could argue that directorial choice stays true to the monotonous realism of the daily grind of life in a prison cell."
2,You'll get sea-sick!,"I might have been more emotionally moved had I not been so nauseous. The way this movie is photographed made me VERY motion-sick. Add to that a scene where the poor woman gets the dry heaves and I was on my way to the bathroom. The only other movie I've seen that made me almost vomit was ""Trainspotting"" and that had nothing to do with motion. Rather, it had something to do with the ""dirtiest toilet in Glasgow."""
1,Totally unrealistic main character,"Let's see, you find out you have very little time left to live, so what do you do?1. NOT tell anyone: your family, friends, etc.2. Cheat on your husband and spend lots of what little time you have left on having an affair instead of being with your devoted family.3. Also spend lots of time making stupid tape recordings.The main character gets absolutely NO sympathy from me. She couldn't die quickly enough.And what's with the crappy end of the movie? They don't show her demise, have everyone find out what a lousy adulturer she was, etc.Seems to me that in this situation, that the doctor would have been required, both legally and ethically, to tell her husband."
4,"a real tearjerker! you will not live '""without"" it....","you will not forget this one easily . the acting is superb all around but mark ruffalo steals the show wonderfully. if you liked ""pieces of april""you should see this one . a very good satire of life .the writer/director done good with her job."
3,self serve pleasure,"i use this bullet every now & then its my second favorite, but the main thin is that it gets the job done"
3,too small to hold during sex,"I bought this for my girlfriend to use during sex. She says it gets too wet to hold since it's so small. It's decently powerful, it gets her off anyways."
2,"Ok story line, but not Biblical Truth","The only reason why I rate this film two stars is that Louis Gossett Jr. was in it and he was excellent as playing the President of the United States. Otherwise, it was an ok story line, but as I always say, they need to stick to the book of Revelation and follow it accordingly if they are to get the message across if they want to reach people. There is so much missing at this stage of the 3rd segment of this series. There should have been alot more happending according to the 7 year tribulation. I guess we will have to see what will happen in the fourth movie if they make one."
2,Disappointing,"I loved the books, and thought the first two movies were pretty decent. This movie though is not. It does not follow the books very well at all. It represents a small section of tribulation force (the second book), and it does not faithfully follow the story in the book. The acting has gone down hill from the first two movies, and the story is just not very compelling. If you have not read the books or seen the first two movies, you will have no clue what is happeing in this movie. If you did read the books, you will keep asking yourself, ""was that in the book?"" The answer in most cases is no. If you see the movie, but haven't read the books, read them. They are much better than the movie. I was very disappointed, because I really was looking forward to this movie."
2,Didn't meet expectations.,"As a fan of the Left Behind series, this movie was not as good as the original. I wish that it had more to offer."
1,left behind movie 3,hated it!!! it made the Christians look really stupid & unmatched to the challenges at hand. it seemed to ignore the whole purpose of the book series - the fight to save mankind from the antichrist by ordinary believers left behind after the Call [the Rapture]. this was the worst movie in the series followed closely by the second movie. i think cloud 10 should just call their movies something else but NOT say they have ANYTHING to do with the left behind series. maybe i wouldn't have been as offended if it was just marketed as science fiction and NOT like its end time fiction like the book series...
4,Great series,Used all three movies in the series to help my youth group get a visual idea of the end times. Love them all!
3,Left Behind,"I purchased this thinking it was something different than it was. I think it was part of a series or something, I was looking for something different."
4,Left Behind World at War,"We didn't enjoy this ""episode"" in the Left Behind series of movies as much as the others. It's ""okay"", but not great."
3,Left Behind-World at War,"This is the third movie in the Left Behind movies. This one seems to leave the novels behind and instead becomes more of an espionage thriller. I love the series and wish the movie had stayed true to form. Nicolae shows more of his demonic power and God does some intervention, there are some remains of the orignal."
1,For Club Members Only,"The seven reviews of the film I have just read confirm what seeing the film suggested: one must be a member of the Club to make much sense of this production. What Club? As best I can make out, a reader of the original book or viewer of the other films in the series. I have done neither and found the film, oh, let us say, rather pointless, overblown and ludicrously pious.Of course, my hypothesis as to those who would enjoy this, may be entirely erroneous and my judgment simply poor taste. I put it down simply to indicate to some innocent potential viewer that not everyone was enamored of the film"
2,Prefer the Clif equivalent for vanilla,"Consistency is rather thin and therefore can be messy. There is a vanilla flavor forward but the finish is not good. More bitter than sour. Over the course of a tennis match I had to abandon this and revert to Clif vanilla, just couldn't stomach the Powerbar version."
2,Stick with Gu or Clif Shots,"I'm not sure if it's the flavor or the brand, but I don't like the taste of this. It has a very artificial flavor. I've never had any issues with Gu or Clif Shots, so I'd stick with those if I were to buy again."
5,Dream Lovers,"Loved this book. It will make for another interesting movie about these two lovers whom after they met were forever joined together solidified even more by their son. Tragic love story and had it not been for Bobby's short time on earth I am sure they would have worked it out and stayed together forever.I cannot help but feel for Dodd who somehow hoped that his parents could have worked it out. As the son of two wonderful icons, he showed us the turmoil in their lives.I thank Dodd for sharing his pain as well as his happy times with his parents though short lived."
4,Sandra Dee fan,I enjoy snooping around celebrities' lives and this book reveals a lot about 1960's Hollywood. I just think he should have waited until his mother passed before writing about her dirty laundry.
2,Hiking adventure of Harold Margolis,"As one who loves the PCT and has made mostly day-hikes from Campo to Cottonwood Pass over several decades, I was somewhat disappointed that the author had not made a through-hike over that same part of the PCT, and in fact had skipped some of it in favor of motor transits. Those few parts that I had been unable to hike because of the long distances between trail-heads were of special interest to me, but turned out to be unrevealing--maybe I hadn't missed anything! Descriptions of flora and fauna were pretty general, esp. the flora, and so not very instructive. Finally, the book needed an editor--lots of grammatical and spelling errors and typos. I suspect the book is of most value to the author and his family as a memoire of a rather long vacation trip."
4,Detailed Description of the Desert Section of the PCT,"This book really describes the experience of walking the first 700 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail in great detail, punctuated by moments of humor and strange situations. My only complaint is that it is a bit long, but a good read nonetheless for anyone considering hiking this section or the whole trail."
3,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,I GOT THIS TAPE IN JULY 05.READING ABOUT HOW GREAT THE MAIN EVENT IS.ITS NOT THAT GOOD HHH VS BATISTA WAS WAY BETTER SO WAS MANKIND VS UNDERTAKER.IF YOU DO BUY THIS TAPE DONT SPEND 40 BUCKS ON IT I WOULD NOT SPEND ANY MORE THE 20 AFTER SEEING IT.
5,WWF No Way Out 2000,"WWF No Way Out 2000.Cactus Jack vs. Triple H in a Hell in the Cell match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship Title.One of my best Hell in the Cell match for the WWF Championship.In this match you see everyting: Chair,2x4 wrap in barbwire in flame and of course the demonic cell.To see all of these stuff in the video it was amazing and to see Mick Foley last match i was mad for a man who wrestle in FMW in Japan,ECW,WWF,WCW and others federations in 15 years of blood,sweat and tears to quit in this way i was [...] off but he wrestle in a match that Linda Mcmahon gave him at Wrestlemania 16 in a 4 way dance for the WWF Championship match vs Triple H vs. The Rock and The Big Show but he lost the match and that was his last match of his 15 years career before returning has WWFcommisionner.For ECW,XPW,FMW,WWF,WCW and others independents harcore wrestling federations fans around the world this video is for you."
4,"Very good, not a classic.","Firstly - 12 year old WWF viewer, you shouldn't be watching this little boy! Secondly its a very good PPV. HHH vs Cactus is a great cell match, the bumps arent as good as at King of the Ring 98 but overall I'd say its actually a better match, though not as good as the Royal Rumble match they had. As for the rest of the card, well most of it is 3 star matches, good but nothing truly exceptional. Overall I'd say this is worth picking up, but 12 year old wwf viewer - stick to the old family entertainment!"
2,Short date,Unable to really judge quality of Goji berries.Arrival date and experation date less then two weeks apart?
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this product last last september...about a month afterwards it stopped working...I hesitated because I felt I needed to return it but did not have the package it came in...instructions said do not return to place of purchase call this number....This item has been in the repair shop more than I have been able to use it. They warranty repair people used it lost my on board tools and guess what they still have it now...I asked for a new one and no response from the warranty company or Eureka...I want my money back...this had been a very bad experience. I ended up purchasing another product a hover vacuum while I still wait for a phone call from the warranty repair shop telling me they have repaired my cleaner. I could not believe when I picked it up the first time after repair it was full of black dirt and all sorts of paper clips, staples and God only knows what else...they had been using it to clean their office..."
5,TIM ROCKS!,"Satire doesn't get any better than this. My first ""Dorsey experience"" was Hammerhead Ranch Motel. I wasn't able to get through 5 pages at a time, without stopping to wipe the tears from laughing. Stingray Shuffle lives up to Tim's greatest. His style is pure biting, sharp and hysterical. For those northern transplants who often wonder if anyone else ""gets"" the absurdity of the Florida life, trust me, Tim (a native Floridian) gets it. Pure enjoyment!"
4,I love her huskies!,Susan Conant writes a pretty loose mystery but I lover her dogs. The stories are good but the mysteries are sometimes thin. The characters are likeable and quirky and the dogs add to the story wonderfully. The whole Holly Winters series is fun if not too serious. A great way to spend a light-hearted afternoon with a touch of murder.
3,"Not a prequel, but a good read for pre-teens and up","My wife and I picked this one up at the bookstore to read together. So technically, I did not read all of it, but rather, we read aloud to each other on a road trip. It only took three days of off and on reading to finish, as it is long but the text is easy to read.As I listened, I had a hard time imagining how this was a prequel to the original Peter Pan stories. I was constantly imagining how every event could lead to the characters and situation I was familiar with. But it was a fun read in its own right.There are some funny moments, and there is quite a bit of violence. Everything has a sense of exaggerated nastiness. I think the way the authors tied up lose endings at the end was somewhat unbelievable and abrupt. But it was good enough that my wife and I are considering reading the rest of the series."
2,Editor Please!,"I've never read Barrie's Peter Pan, but after reading the scathing reviews of this book believe me it is now much much higher on our list.This story is interesting, but please, please, please, do a reprint that has been edited better. I have been reading it out loud to my family and am tired of having to correct the obvious errors. It's not just a typo here and there, but glaring errors, like words missing from sentences, that should have been caught on editing and trip the reader up making it impossible to thoroughly enjoy this story.I am not a perfect writer, I am not a perfect editor, I don't pretend to be, but I do read a lot of books out loud to my family and this book is riddled with more editing errors than anything we have read previously."
3,Misses the Point,"This is a cute story, but certainly misses being the great story that the original Peter Pan is. It misses the important point, which is that Peter refuses to grow up. It blames his condition on a magic spell."
1,"BAD book, TERRIBLE ending!","I thought that this book was well written, except for the dialogue. It was pretty slow it switches off chapters from different characters,which I liked. You can make a lot of connections between real life and the book. And connections to other books, Tinker Bell. I didn't like the book very much, the ending was terrible! Worst ending ever. It was very disappointing as a reader."
4,the best long book,there is a group of orphans that are going tobe slaves.butfirst they have to take a journey.on the journey the orphans meet a new friend named Molly.Who ison a team called the starcatchers.Shetries to hide it from them until one of them finds out she was hiding something.Then she tells him.Ithink everybody should read it.
4,Good to get the background down...,"This would make a great bedtime story for kids. It's a great way to introduce children to chapter books (read them a different chapter each night until the book is finished) and since it's the prequel to the commonly known Peter Pan it's a great way to give kids the history of the famous boy who would not grow up. It did have a few slow sections, but they were mostly in the beginning, which is common for many long novels. I highly recommend this book for readers of all ages and I feel that it brought me even closer to the story of Peter Pan, which I already knew and loved."
5,Amazon was the cheapest.,"Since receiving the let's learn and play road rug I spend more time with my son and his love of cars has grown. he likes setting up the cars and asks me if the light is red or green, we have hours of fun."
5,A fun read-aloud book,"Fixions and Other Stories is a fascinating, fun book that is as much fun for grownups as children. When read aloud, it is a joyful experience of the language, in a rural African setting. Sort of an African ""Aesops Fables""."
4,"too much mary j, not enough shareffa","i don't know about her, was my first thoughts when i saw her video for ""i need a boss"", but this ablum is very good,the downside is there's too much on here that i can say i heard before(mary j), and if your going to copy, do it right"
3,Warm 'n Fuzzy but short,"I was very excited to receive this book. I was pretty surprised at the simplicity and length (or rather, lack thereof) of it... I have many short books, but I think I was expecting just a tad more from this one. It is certainly lovely, and my son likes it, but you might choose to look at it at the library first to see if it is the right book for you!"
1,"Ordered 25-count,got 2 pieces.Seller explained it was a spam listing.","Petco.com explained it was a spam listing.But just wondering why amazon.com allowed the spam listing on their website to collect money? Anyway, seller has refund money.The two pieces Snozzles have very bad oil smell.Have droped it to trash can."
5,very nice bag,"I have this bag and it is really nice. It fits all my kids stuff, I like how it is nice and boxy. It looks like the Petunia Pickle bottom but I did not pay that high of a price. My friend told me about how nice are Global Kecci bags and I am glad that I listened to her advice and bought the bag. This is a nice bag that I would recommend to others."
1,Real Linguistics,"It's an interesting topic, no doubt, but the Whorf Hypothesis has gone out of favor in the field of linguistics.I recommend Pinker for not-too-technical linguistic reading."
3,Needs the steel pedal,The simplehuman round can is attractive but the pedal is flawed. The plastic resin will fail after a few mos. In my case 8 mos on 2 separate occassions. The repais is to get the steel pedal. Simplehuman will send this out. I think their CS is excellent. A shame they sold the product with a flaw.edit: received the steel pedal and took 4 mins to install. Perfect CS service and again a great product. I would change this to a 4 star now!
4,hate the noisy lid,"The metal lid instead of the newer plastic lid is a must have because a metal lidded step can is the only acceptable trash receptacle to have in a kitchen. I have had this for five years and have never had a problem with this and this was purchased before the manufacturer name changed to simplehuman. At least once a year, Target has a sale of these for about thirty five dollars and include a bonus mini step can."
3,SILLY FUN B FLICK! THIS IS AVAILABLE ON DVD!,"This is one of those films that you either love it or hate it! I know it's silly........I know one of the stars doesn't have one word of dialogue, but I love this film! It's got sexy girls and lots of stock animal footage...add a memorable fun ending and you got....'Captive Wild Woman'! This is available on DVD on Universal Horror an exclusive at Best Buy. The transfers are very good for all 5 film and there are some trailers. Hurry before they're gone!"
3,Lacks a compelling character,"Some of Pekar's books I have started and really wanted to continue. I find some of his work to be a treat. But the Malice story comes across to me as sort of factual, lacking emotional content. I simply could care less about the Michael Malice as portrayed in this book. I found myself reading it to see if it would get better; it didn't.Malice almost always is portrayed as having arrived, and rarely struggling. There are no surprises. No moments of doubt. No vulnerability. Malice simply sees the world in black and white, right and wrong, intelligent and stupid. Sounds like Rush Limbaugh in a way, doesn't it? But Malice is more liberal than Rush, but not much.All in all, this is a story about someone who is overbearing. The only upside of the book for me is to see how another person views the world."
2,I don't think so,"This book is not well written. Chapter review questions often confusing and of little meaning to the subject. Even the teacher can't understand some of them, but he did chose this book so I guess he liked it. The index does not contain some of the words used to describe the subject matter, even some on the words that are bold face. Instructions for the hand on projects are usually wrong, we waste a lot of time just trying to understand the instructions I am on chapter 10 about way -can I have my money back?"
4,Great text companion,"This book is a fantastic companion for ""Cases and Materials on Criminal Law - 5th Edition"" by: Joshua Dressler, part of the American Casebook Series. It outlines and explains criminal law concepts well. The only issue is that it lacks examples, but the explanations are very good."
1,Not worth the wait,"I just recently bought the video and was eager to try it based on the other reviews that people had left. When I got it, I popped it into the VCR to watch and I have never seen a more poorly made video. It looks as though someone grabbed a camcorder from their closet and decided to make a workout tape. I was very dissatisfied with it and found that all it was basically good for was a laugh as the exercises were not very effective. I wouldn't recommend this video to anyone, and definately not for the price that I paid for it."
1,Too confusing,I love true crime books but this one didn't make any sense and I gave up after the first 50 pages. Nothing was in sequence. I'm making a note not to buy any other books written by this author.
2,"It is concise, but also boring, and certainly not short","This book is concise, but reads like a dictionary definition of Brazilian history. It will have a hard time keeping your attention, even if you are compeletely unfamiliar with Brazilian history.A much better book is Thomas Skidmore's recent book on the history of Brazil. Or, if you are looking for an understaning of the present state of things in Brazil, I would highly recommend Joseph Page's ""The Brazilians."""
4,Prosaic Correct Academic History,"After starting to learn some basic Portuguese I realized that I new next to nothing about the history of Brazil, and thought I should change that. One thing leads to another and I take this book out from the library.Standard serious academic history here. The text is prosaic, of course, but doesn't seem to me to get dull or into unnecessary and trivial details. The author seems to have a good head on his shoulders, no fantasies or obscure theoreticizing. I find nothing at all awkward or incorrect about the translation either, basically the book reads as if originally written in English. Seems to me that ""A Concise History of Brazil"" is written as it should be."
5,new vocalist with an old fashioned sensibility,I am inspired by the authenticity of Nicols' vocal style. It is unassuming and compelling. Her tone is rich and fullof nuance. My favorite new jazz vocalist and album. The musicians are all top notch. Nicols has her own style but reminds me of Nancy Wilson and Ella Fitzgerald. A great investment and addition to my collection.
3,"Graphically Okay, But not as fun!","Robots is pretty much a port of the GBA game but with a few added features to utilize the touchpad. The graphics are pretty decent on the DS, but the gameplay and replay value could use a little help. I suggest you rent the game or try it out before you buy. It's great for the kids, but for the average adult, you may want to look elsewhere. Try WarioWare Touched! It's a game with great replay value!"
2,A Bit Too Cool,"Children under the age of eight may enjoy this. Over that age it stretches credulity to the point where it snaps completely. It's a morality tale that loses its way long before the ending in sheer disbelief at what you're seeing, at least if you've made it out of grammar school."
4,Dirty Bomb is Dirty Funky Hardcore,"'Dirty Bomb' is my 4th Zoobombs CD, and completes my set as far as North American releases go, and matches their debut in intensity, power, and wound-up energy in every way. The Zoobombs are perhaps one of the most talented yet underrated bands in the world, in addition, Don Matsuo is a brilliantly gifted, yet unrecognized guitarist/arranger. An undiscovered gem, those having the pleasure of Zoobombs' brash sounds grace their ears, can appreciate funky hardcore at it's fiercest...and at it's absolute finest."
3,"Works, but not ideal","Although this does work on most of my pots, on some of the smaller ones, it isn't convenient since it won't clip on the lid. The unit seems very flimsy, so I fear it will let go at some point in the future and let the food pour out. Hopefully I am wrong about this point."
2,The 3rd edition has TOC incomplete!,"For those who plan to buy the hard copy of this 3rd edition at this time, you should know that its Table of Contents is INCOMPLETE! I see this new (3rd) edition has 14 chapters in it; however, its TOC shows only up to about a half of chapter 11, then finishes right there. So, you might want to wait until Dover publishers fixes the problem before buying a corrected version."
1,don't buy it will rust,I thought what a deal. Well i didn't even get what I paid for this time. The knives were rusting in less than 2 weeks i am going to see about returning them. i thought this was a good brand! This is horrible.
4,Great pics for Plasma TV,Great product.. wish there was a better choice of full screen images though.. for the price you can't beat it..
2,"Right size, wrong book","We selected this phrasefinder thinking it would have good basic information to help us get around in Spain. It was somewhat useful for my husband, who only remembered a few words of high school Spanish and was able to use it to refresh his memory. But, beware: there are mistakes, including a big one on p. 28 of the ""Spanish Grammar Basics"" section which confuses the verbs ""ser"" and ""ir."" Also, this book is full of Latin American words and expressions which don't work in Spain. And, the dictionary in the back is just too small to be of any consequence. It became our running joke that, each time we encountered an interesting new word, it wouldn't be in there. We wouldn't recommend this book, but suggest choosing a compact (well edited!) Spanish-English dictionary for use on your travels."
3,"Well written, but not his best series.","Sort of a cross between Bones & Buffy, this follows the adventures of a College fresh woman who is also interning at the local morgue.In this, the 1st book of the series, there is nothing supernatural, and honestly too much of the book is spent talking about her first week on campus.I am a Chris Golden fan, loving several of his other series, but this series just didn't do it for me. Perhaps it's aimed at a different audience. Not that I threw it down in disgust or demaned my $ back, but I can't see reading any more in the series.But try it yourself, if you're a Chris Golden fan.I gave it ***, but I concede I was torn between *** & ****."
5,Insect larave!,"Although this is the first book of A BODY OF EVIDENCE, it was well-written and full of suspense. This story tells of a girl, Jenna Blake, who starts her freshman year at Somerset University. She got a job at Somerset Medical Centre as a pathology assistent. She assist at an autopsy where a man died with his brian full of insect larave. She felt even more curious, scared and upset when her professor died of the same cause. The mystery starts here. Jenna was determined to solve the mystery. She was stalked by a mysterious man and was almost killed. When the mysterious man failed to kil Jenna in his first attempt, he made two more attempts on Jenna's life. Who was this man? What does he want with Jenna? I were hooked on this book when I started reading it. I am like Jenna who was racing against time to find out the murder before someone else gets hurt. Can she make it?"
4,Rare air is one of a kind,"I saw this group with Trevor at Norfolk's British Isles festival with a wonderful ""Bagoff"" including the Tavnerhill Weavers (from the ""ole country"") in 1984. Looking for ""alterative hard wood"" or ""heavy woode"" music ... this will fit the bill ..."
5,Don't get any on your shoe...,"I once stepped in some Flamma at Dog Beach. It's tough to get off , but doesn't smell as bad as they say. I've heard the author lives out of a locker, but I find that hard to believe. Someone told me he once lived with his Mother, now that I can believe... Buy this book, you'll be pleased in an ""Boy, I'm glad I wasn't on that plane."" sort of way."
5,This Game rocks,"I havent recieved the game yet, but my freind got it yesterday in the mail from amazon.com and it is the best game ive ever played!!"
2,Finally Dreamcast! .......This is the best they could do?,"Ok seriously, It's ok but if your expecting to be rocketed into a 3-d interactive world of eye-popping graphics and endless options of play, Stay with N64's Link. Some flying blood mild cursing and realistic grunting does little to capture imagination. Ok story line holds interest in otherwise restictive game world."
5,A GREAT START FOR SEGA!,In the middle of last year Sega released the Dreamcast. Now I am a veteran of video games and am faithful to Sega but they have seriously screwed up with the Saturn. Now their redemption comes in the form of the Dreamcast with an awesome lineup of Sonic Adventure and Blue Stinger. Blue stinger is a highly addictive survival game. The game is a tough one but thats how we like it. The graphics are smooth with a rare bout of slowdown. Any fan of games such as Resident Evil and movies like Mimic this is one game you don't want to miss. WARNING: GAME NOT FOR FAINT OF HEART=BLOOD&GORE!
4,Highly recommended for B-movie sense of humour,"I continue to enjoy this wacky (unintentionally as well as intentionally) Resident Evil/Dino Crisis clone combo. BUT, as the other reviewer said, the disc I received also DID NOT play on my Dreamcast!I've already played and enjoyed it, and want a new copy for my book/game/DVD shelves. Will I (or you) get another defective copy? We'll see."
2,Good taste but not great nausea relief,"I bought this for the advertised nausea relief and it did not alleviate mine. My nausea is quite severe so, it could work for some. The taste of the tea is good, though."
1,TERRIBLE,My product NEVER came in the mail!! I even emailed them and got no response back. Luckily I only paid about 5 bucks for the book so it wasn't that much of a loss but either way it was TERRIBLE service; in fact it was NO service at all.
4,Serge is still fun,This was not my favorite book from the series but it was still an enjoyable read. Serge Storms makes a great character and Dorsey does a great job with all the different characters.
3,Very readable,"Looking for his missing brother, Kip Nunninger rode into dangerous Antelope Valley, and nothing was going to stop him. But he was a boy on a man's errand, and the Valley watched him, knowing that he'd be gunned down before he grew to be a man. Kip was sure that Antelope Valley held the truth to his brother's disappearance. He didn't know that it also held a bullet and a gravesite, both with his name on them!This is your typical youngster out of his elements who you know will be picked on and he'll eventually come out on top - or is it?Barry Cord always has a few tricks up his sleeve to throw the reader off track, although here I did work out the main twist to the story early on.As well as strong male characters there's a very strong female lead too.This is a story filled with greed, love, jealousy and murder. A story that doesn't end as you'd expect for some of the characters.Perhaps not the best Barry Cord book I've read but certainly worth a look."
3,"Latin Kick ""OK""","This workout is ""OK"" It is a bit different from other kickboxing work-outs that I have done. I just wanted a bit more of a cardio-kick. I also expected more ""LATIN"". But This is a good workout."
3,Spiritual Healing for everyone,I liked this book because it gives you beautiful living examples of how you can heal on a spiritual level that will manifest in your every day life.I recommend it especially for those who might be doubtful of beginning a healing of the spirit...
5,What an adventure!,"This author has so adeptly put the story of many souls- through her own story- into a graceful easy read. It clearly shows how one woman lived through the struggle of personal growth, giving hope to us all. Her discovery of healing along the way is example of how we can all turn adversity into triumph, a triumph of the Soul.Her journey into claiming and owning what Spirit was showing her, to help herself and others-- and most importantly showing others how to help themselves, is a true testament to the ability we all have. Soul Adventures shows that no matter where you started, or what bumps you encounter along the way, we can all become happier humans and content spiritual beings! This book clearly tells how our inner soul does speak, and Jean Adrienne offers us a great way to listen.An enjoyable and profound reading experience."
5,An incredible surprise,"River Teeth is a richly woven and intricate collection of short works. Duncan's writing is thick like poetry; his words are delictible. River Teeth explores the beauty of life through glimpses of nature, family, and human spirituality. Duncan is my favorite author and this is my favorite book."
1,Wrong idea,"I found this book to be totally offensive, and I don't recommend it to anyone. As a girl, this book severely lowered my self esteem."
1,"amateurish, unskilled rubbish","Being English I have seen my fair share of terrible exercise dvd's as Britain is the home of the bad exercise dvd. However this is the worst piece of tat I have ever seen. The instructor has no idea how to kick or punch and the routines are poorly constructed. The other people in the DVD also have no technique whatsoever. I bought this DVD as I have many of Billy Blanks taebo DVD's and also Kathy Smith's kickboxing workout, these are excellent workouts and I was hoping to build on my collection as the DVD promises to ""really get your adrenaline pumping"" and give you a ""dynamic workout"" I was sorely disappointed. I can see no benefit whatsoever in using this DVD."
2,Maybe back in 1991,"Poor picture and sound quality, and most of the models do not look very in shape. Also, there is a part where you are supposed to run around in circles. This is not a challenging workout. It might be ok for beginners, but not for anyone who is used to this type of exercise.The same money could be spent on a decent Tae Bo DVD."
1,Not for experienced.,"This book is for people who do not know HTML already. It covers DHTML very little. Almost the half of the book is about HTML.I gave it to a friend of mine who wants to start building homepage.If you're an experienced, get a book from O'Reilley."
4,Because You Suck,"I bought this book because I read 'You Suck', which totally engrossed me, and this is sort of a follow-on book. Kinda. A plethora of strange but very endearing and entertaining people inhabit the book, and the story is actually really good. I enjoyed this book very much."
2,A decent read,"This is the first Moore book I have read. I thought it was ok. The story was pretty original and somewhat entertaining, but I just don't share his sense of humor. I love dark, bizarre humor, and that's what brought me to this book. My favorite author is Chuck Palahniuk, who, as many of you probably know, has an extremely dark and twisted sense of humor. I just didn't think that this book was all that funny. I admit, it did have its moments. There were times that I laughed pretty hard at this book, but these moments were few and far between. I saw many moments where this book was trying to be funny, it just seemed to me like Moore was trying too hard. I would be willing to try reading a Moore book again, but from what I could tell from this book, you need a very specific sense of humor to really enjoy this him. It is dark, but I thought it could be really corny and dumb at times too."
4,Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns,"The book is very good, perhaps so extensive, but it approach in detail all the formations some one can found in trading"
3,Meh.,"For a lay reader looking for an introduction to ev-psych, I advise against ""The Moral Animal"". It's been a couple years since I read it, but I remember it being boring, unenlightening, and bogged down with biographical vignettes of Charles Darwin. It might be a good intro for people who enjoy history and literature more than science texts, but this is pure speculation--I know few of these people and rarely give them books. If you want a light intro without the fluff, I'd suggest ""Evolutionary Psychology: An Introduction"" by Workman and Reader, a completely nontechnical textbook that actually spends more time explaining ev-psych than trying to convince the reader it's not an evil, misogynistic pseudoscience. It's the sort of text high-school (or even middle-school) teachers would use in a parallel universe where ""evolutionary psychology"" has a redundant adjective."
5,retructuring the structured book,It is the best book I ever read. It have lots eye opening view to see the presumed structured world in another way. Darwin's eye were really amazing.
4,tabula rasa be gone,"Not quite as ground breaking as The Selfish Gene, and it took me awhile to get used to reading page after page of Darwin's life (yes, I got the fact he was just a literary device, but I'd rather have abstract examples) but an overall excellent read on how the most trivial behavior looks through the lens of evolutionary psychology."
5,The Moral Animal,Fabulous book. Makes you think about the actions we perform everyday in our life and why. Helps to understand people and natural instincts. It is a fascinating book.
5,Breathtakeing and spellbound,"It's been a long time since I have read a book like this, I put down my reading materials for awhile so glad I renewed my reading by picking up this book. Abbie had a lot of sad happenings in her life, I wish the book dealt more of what happen with her sister but yet glad it did not in away for I don't think I could of read how she was put to death by those evil men. Zeke was very spell bound, a truly love story the more I read about Indian love stories how I wish I could of been there The Indian's are truly from the heaven and the earth may their spirit's live on forever how I wish the white man would of accepted them we would of learn from them alot. A must to read for all."
3,"Hegel isn't ""un perro muerte""","Very few writers sympathetic to Marxism have been so rigorously anti-Hegelian as Colletti. Althusser of course was the more famous Marxist anti-Hegelian. This book was announced at the time of its appearance to be ""almost"" the equal of Lukacs' ""History and Class Consciousness"" in terms of rigor and philosophical depth. It is indeed a rigorous and throughgoing work of philosophy but its unremitting arrogance is its chief fault (Colletti once branded Sartre's philosophy as a ""philosophy of the soda parlor""). Its wholesale dismissal of Hegelian Marxism as some kind of idealist mumbo-jumbo (outdoing Lenin in being Leninist)in the name of his own brand of ""epistemological naturalism"" led him in the end to trash Marxism altogether as a mere continuation of German Idealism. I have no idea where Colletti is now. He apparently hasn't written any books since giving up leftist politics."
4,Preping for Travel,"We are preparing to Experience the Inside Passage during the summer of 1999. This will be our first trip. We wanted to read a book that would give us an idea of history, and what to expect on this first trip. This book is excellent on preparing one for a trip to this magestic country. Not only do you learn about the fishing industry, you learn about history, the summer weather, how residents survive in this country, its wildlife and senery. The maps in the book and their description of travel through the many inside passages is great and we now have a much better idea of what to expect when we arrive.Certainly worth reading if you have an interest in the coast line from Seattle to Skageway.Gary Beach"
2,Try some better cables,"The service was fine. The order arrived when expected. Although the connectors are too fat, I was able to get them plugged in. The picture was great for about a week, but continues to get worse every day. It's becoming very pixelized especially on games with a dark background. Had to go back to the original cables that came with the Wii. I guess I wasted my money. Do your research and buy some higher quality cables."
5,This is one of the funniest and moving show business bios!,I read 3 - 4 books a week including many Hollywood autobiographys and Esther Williams book is one of the funniest and moving books in that genre I've read in quite some time. Thank God she has a sense of humor about her life because it was rarely ever easy! Thank you Esther for giving us a glimpse of your life! You are one of a kind.
4,Ms. Williams writes as well as she swims!,"More interesting than I expected April 1, 2002Ms. Williams writes with surprising candor of her early Hollywooddays. There was a great deal I didn't know about Esther Williams prior to reading her book and was pleasantly surprised to find out what an interesting woman she is! She speaks openly about her co-workers (other movie ""stars""), the education she received from making movies and the studio system and her family life. An astute businesswoman as well, Ms. Williams was also very involved in synchronized swimming including its induction into the Olympics. I was surprised to find that I had a hard time putting the book down."
5,She could do it all!,"When I was a kid my favorites were the Esther Williams movies. What an inspiration, she could do it all, swim, dive, syncronized swimming, underwater ballet, water skiing, dance, dramatics, and just plain light up the screen!. I loved the part where she said she learned to swim fast when she was young and starring in an aquatic show with Johnny Weismueller because he was always behind her and was always wanting to catch her so he could reach out and under and....! Great book. And dear Esther, if you happen to read this, I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!"
2,Not so great,"Got it quickly. But, expansion band is too small and setting day/date is nearly impossible because knob on side of watch is so small and moving the knob in and out from one position to another to set day/date is not for me."
3,Pulsar PJ6017 with expansion band.,"Great watch, I like the style and size.The expansion band is another story, it tends to snag the hairs on my wrist."
3,Last of the 5,"This is the last of the 5 Contemporary albums Niehaus made (Jan. 1956), and it shows a definite falling off in quality compared to the earlier ones. The frequent all-out swinging that occurred previously is lacking here; in fact, only one tune, THREE OF A KIND, is taken up-tempo. Some of the originals, FOND MEMORIES and BELLE OF THE BALL, for example, are rather desultory; the version of ILL WIND, with Bill Perkins on flute, is just plain bad. The rest of the tunes are pretty good, but this CD is not essential Lennie Niehaus."
3,Poor Advertisement,"I am dissapointed with my purchase. first of all The tables i received were not Direct drive. they were belt drive. One of the Needles that were provided had no needle. Also the mixer doesn't work, the headphones do not work. I had to provide my own power cord and rca were not the same. overall i'm not to happy with the poor advertisement that amazon provides. Does amazon really screen what they are selling. I doubt it."
5,Astonishing Solution,"George Vercessi has brought years of experience on the Washington scene and a thorough knowledge of Navy operations, along with his natural talent to spin a fascinating and chilling tale, together to create a riveting, thought-provoking account of assassination and high stakes political maneuvering with an astonishing ending in the White House.His handling of military traditions, covert operations and desperate actions is superb. An easy book to read, but not easy to put down until you've finished. You will not forget the final chapter any time soon."
3,probably not for absolute beginners,"Includes Tamil text, trancription, translation and vocabulary (in Tamil script and transcription). I am afraid the book doesn't teach you Tamil per se, but rather conversation and colloquiallisms. Actually the transcription is a half way between transcription and transliteration. The voicing and spirantisation are not marked (only k, not k or h or g), nasal vowels are marked. The Tamil texts doesn't always correspond to transcription."
1,Don't fall victim to the marketing,"So let me start by saying that I originally tried several different HDMI cables when I went HD just to return them and use the cable that came with the DVD player. I've always felt a little bit ""dirty"" using the 50 cent cable that came with the player so after looking into this cable I decided to get one. Short answer: waste of money. I tried this on three different up-converting DVD players and two different televisions (DLP and Plasma) and in each configuration the cable actually made the picture worse. It did brighten the image, but that was never a problem for me. I also did a blind test with some friends, and they all agreed the RazorVision made the image less clear (although brighter). If you're like me and have trouble sleeping at night because you have the stock cables, spend your money on a good therapist, not on this cable."
2,These things are huge,"I have been taking omega's for the last 5 or 6 years. These are by far my least favorite. For one, these pills are HUGE! By far the biggest pills I have taken ever just in general. My girlfriend looked at them and said they were bigger than her pre-natal vitamins. The other thing I really didn't like, is that these omega's are only the second brand of omega's that have given me fish burps. (if you have ever gotten them, then you know how gross they are); eh...just buyer beware...I just know that I won't go with this brand next time..."
3,Average,"Seems about on par with the Kirkland. has a fishy aftertastem, and will cause ocassional heartburn. I'd recommend an Enteric if taking daily."
4,two hump camel,"This ia sturdy plush animal, with skeletal wires that allow you to adjust its stance so it can stand alone. I'm not sure it was as tall as 40"", but it was probably that long. The manufacturer's contact person was very helpful when I called to see if there were wires inside. Delivery was very prompt, which was crucial to our situation."
3,"Interesting, with a few though provocing remarka","I definitely and strongly recomend this book to anyone considering going to HBS (and only to those!). The book is quite intelectually oriented (you will find little clies on who Bob really is, what kind of poetry, of literature he likes, who his friends are) but that is OK. The best remark in this book is his ""lemmings theory"" - the theory that too many of us just go with the crowd, without really knowing where we would like to go. Interesting!!"
4,Great Watch,This is good watch for someone who has problem reading the numbers are quite big. It was a gift for my dad. He love it. It's still working have not had any trouble with it.
3,OKAY FOR NOW WE'LL SEE AFTER SOME LABOR ON UNIT,"FOR THOSE BRAND NAME TOOL TECHNICIANS THE UNIT COMES WITH A BIG DSR LABEL ON IT STANDING FOR (DON SCHUMACHER RACING). NOT SCHUMACHER LIKE THE PICTURE SHOWS. THE NEEDLE IS A BIT UNSTABLE BEING THAT IT KEEPS CLIMBING WHEN APPLIED 1/2 THE CCA'S. I HAVE TO KEEP ADJUSTING NEEDLE. OVERALL LOOKS OF IT. IT LOOKS WELL MADE AND HAS A PROFESSIONAL LOOK ABOUT IT. HOPEFULLY IT PERFORMS AND STANDS UP TO IT'S NAME AND PRICE. THANKS. ADRIAN,"
5,Took me back to the 80's,Love It!! Took me back to my High school days! I miss the talent that is not in the new videos on Mtv! Michael Jackson was and is Great!
2,Go for the better version,"I purchased this for myself after using a Theracane someone else had. I do not like this one at all compared to the Theracane. The plastic is very weak and bends when you put pressure on it, therefore it does not dig into your muscle like something more strong would. Because it bends, it is not effective in working out the knots in my shoulder. I say go for something more expensive and rigid like the Theracane because this is not effective."
2,Doesn't reach far enough,"I may have been spoiled to receive the full sized body buddy first, While I can hit the pressure point near my shoulder blade, that all I can reach with this tiny tool. But for the price, I can't say this is too shabby for a backup tool. :)"
1,Social science back 60 years?,"This text displays a plethora of simplistic, presumptuous and shallow typologies purporting to explain what is a leader and why it has to be so. Without any concern for contemporary social studies the author tells us about what inborn qualities signifies a female leader, why there are fewer black leaders than white ones (""scientifically proven"" low cognitive ability according to the author, pp. 740-741), and the litany goes on. It is baffling that this stuff is still available in the book market as anything else than obscure reminiscences of American social science in a time we rather forget about."
1,dreadful. to be avoided at all cost,"This book raises ignorance to a level near sublime. It is wretchedly prejudiced against the Germans, blind to the suffering of the Russian soldiers, and maniacal in its insistence on digging out racial prejudice. I have read many works of history, and a good few on the Great War. This is an infamous performance and a shameful waste of one's time and money."
3,World War I from the perspective of the British and British poets,"Martin Gilbert is a very concise and thoughtful writer and if this book had been properly titled, I would give it 5 stars. However, this is not a ""Complete History"". I would wager than less than 12 Austro-Hungarians are mentioned by name, but names of British soldiers appear like poppies in Flanders.The title of this review, in my opinion, reflects the true title of this book. If you wish to read a book about World War I from the British perspective, and more properly from the perspective of the British intelligentsia and poets, this is the perfect book for you.If you wish to read a book that is truly a ""Complete History"", try wonderful writers such as Niall Ferguson or John Keegan.Mr. Gilbert is an excellent writer, despite the negativity of this review. I highly recommend his ""Churchill: A Life""."
3,"Well-written and interesting, but fairly repetitive.","Martin Gilbert has created a fascinating account, filled with relevant eyewitness statements, of the harsh reality and monotony of the First World War. The biggest drawback to this work was the repetitious references to Winston Churchill as being the unsunf hero of the British cause, and as the man who possessed all the answers to end the war successfully. Overall an interesting and fulfilling read."
2,Sort by Date,"I'm not privy to the specific tchniques that Gilbert used in compiling this volume, but one suspects that he compiled a large computer database with each entry carefully dated. He ignored any large scale accounts such as analyses of campaigns and battles and, instead, concentrated on personal accounts, letters, and poems. (He apparently discarded none of the latter). Finally, he sorted by date, edited this chronological assortment of personal accounts, and called it a ""complete history.""The result is a disjointed, small scale view of the battlefield with little insight into the large events that made up World War I. One is left with a sense of the incredible stupidity of the political and military leaders that led to the senseless slaughter of millions of men. If you didn't already know that, then buy the book. If you already knew this essential fact about WWI, there may be better (and more complete) histories out there."
1,Toooo Expensive,"Too expensive, when you can get similar high quality products from other manufacturers."
5,"Sub warfare in the North Atlantic, by one who survived.","Herbert Werner with Mr. Beach's help has written one of the most detailed, engrossing naratives of combat that I have ever read. Werner served on U-boats as an officer throughout most of the war, becoming a U-boat commander in '44. Though highly detailed the book reads almost like a novel it is that interesting. His descriptions of depth charge attacks will have you breaking out in a cold sweat. By mid '43 U-boats faced a huge challenge just getting out to open sea. Werner describes his time spent in ports in great detail as well. Overall the book provides the reader with a picture of what WW2 sub warfare is all about and what life as an officer in Hitler's Germany was like.I first read this book over 20 years ago and it is one of those books I can just re-read periodically My initial impression of it's overall excellence still remains. Highly recomended."
5,couldn't put it down,"Excellent book. I'm very much into reading memoirs and personal accounts of various wars - and so far this book takes the cake. Life really sucked in the U-Boat fleet, and this book does a very good job portraying the horrors of the war. I have read the books from the Allied perspective regarding the Battle of the Atlantic, but this was my first book told from the Axis perspective. I read in whatever spare time I have - which isn't much, but this book really made me find more time to read. I continually found myself saying I'll read to page xxx then go to sleep, but ended up reading way beyond that.There is a good balance of things personal, technical, historical, and a good bit of action thrown in there. A good companion book is ""Turning the Tide"" - a story of the merchant marines who helped to defeat the U-Boat threat."
3,Iron Coffins,I enjoyed this book very much as it was a subject that I enjoy and was surprised when I learned it was written by aprevious German U-Boat Captain. Very well done with on shore details that was certainly of interest as well.
5,My favorite Show,I was looking for the disc. So when I realized Amazon had it at a great price I ordered it. I arrived ahead of time and the the packaging was great. The quality was great. I have watched just about all of the shows. So it looks like I will need to order Season 2.
1,NAUSEATING & RIDICULOUS - HARD TO STOMACH,"I just cannot finish watching the first season of this irritating series. Mrs Jennifer Hart (portrayed by Stephanie Powers) drives me up the wall - she's so vain, forever primping her hair, pouting her lips & exclaiming ""Jonathan"" all the time even at crucial moments. She's defintely a brunette bimbo.This series scores a five on a ""gag"" meter. What a waste of money buying this dvd set."
5,An All-Time Classic!,"I am SO happy that Hart to Hart is finally coming to DVD. Back when I was in high school, I had to be in bed at 10 PM. One night, while doing homework, Hart to Hart came on TV and I immediately fell in love with the show. That became the one school night that I could stay until 11. Ah, the memories. Robert and Stefanie had a true admiration, love and respect for one another. They truly were Jonathan and Jennifer Hart. Lionel, as Max, and Freeway the dog rounded out this amazing quartet. I agree with the other reviewers. Please don't let us wait too long for the other seasons."
2,Not readable!,"I bought this book on the strength of the other reviews. I was looking for something readable and short to give a nice overview. On the positive side, the book was short. But it was dry, dense, and not for the beginner. It frequently used French words it did not define, and you were left struggling to figure out what they meant by context alone. It used concepts that were not explained, such as the Three Estates. I had to go to Wikipedia to supplement my knowledge so that I could understand the book. It was wordier than it had to be. The worst part is that it was so conclusionary, I would know something, but wasn't sure why that was. And that's the whole point of reading the book."
2,Sedona Cliffs Notes,"An interesting book that pleasantly reminded me of my visits to Sedona and the people I met there. But aside from its nostalgic value, I found this book a bit choppy. A series of vignettes more than anything else, most without any significant story line development given the 3-5 pages allocated to each. One of these, a brief vignette of a secondary character being robbed on a cruise, has no relevance to the central plot, particularly given that the character is never addressed again in the book. There is a central story line, but it isn't very strong, and doesn't unfold very naturally. The book concludes in an open-ended way that may be thought-provoking, but it felt to me more like the author simply ran out of gas. While I finished this book, and did like it for its triggering memories of the area, I found it disappointing against the backdrop of the other highly favorable reviews posted here."
5,Very Pleased,"I was so pleased to find this Play Along Club Doll Accessory Pack on Amazon. I had purchased a Play Along Doll for my granddaughter a couple of years ago, but had been unable to find any new accessory packs to go with it. That was something I had hoped to do. I ordered this Play Along Club Doll Accessory Pack, and it arrived promptly. It will be so much fun to give it to my granddaughter."
1,Cher Gold tarnished,"I love Cher. I have been a fan of hers for 34 years. All of these greatest hits cds are the same ol,same ol'. I like to see a cd of her earlier recordings as Bonnie Jo Mason ,""RINGO,I LOVE YOU"". Her covers with Sonny as Caesar and Cleo,""Do You Want To Dance"", ""LOVE IS STRANGE"" and "" LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL""> Plus I know there are many,many unreleased Sonny and Cher songs hiding in both ATCO and MCA vaults.Probably more songs with her other record labels. Yes, I'd like to see her late 70's LPS of ""STARS""<""I'D RATHER BELIEVE IN YOU"",""CHERISHED"" and ""ALLMAN & WOMAN:TWO THE HARD WAY"" released. I can't keeep buying the same songs over and over.Making writers and record companies richer."
2,Disappointing,"As a Catholic seeking a more complete understanding of the ""tough issues"" for which critics bash our Church, this book is disappointing. Weighing in at only 83 pages, this book leaves much to be desired. Most ""chapters"" consist of only a review of an issue's history followed by a series of questions about it, in a food-for-thought manner.To be fair, the book seems like it is intended for religious education classes or other discussion groups. For the individual reader, however, I would look into George Weigel's book, ""The Truth of Catholicism,"" Peter Kreeft's ""Catholic Christianity,"" or Alan Schreck's ""Catholic and Christian.""I give the Most Reverend Pilarczyk credit for doing what many Archbishops should be doing--which is seeking to better educate the laity about Church teachings--but this book, unfortunately, just isn't substantive."
5,Nova - Absolute Zero,"This is a must see video on several levels:- Getting some insight on the personalities in the history of research.- Learning how the frozen food industry got started.- Learning why getting there is so important.Those are only some of the interesting things about this video. It is well done and even someone without a pre-disposition to scientific things would enjoy it, and learn something in the process."
1,Worthless,"A piece of junk. Analog tuner disguised as digital, sound quality is abysmal and reception is the pits. A Sony model is about the best you can find, better quality but not by much. My quest has led me to believe a good kitchen cabinet radio is non-existent."
5,Wicked!,This cd is wonderful! We listen to it all the time. It's fun for kids and even the whole family!
5,Wicked is wicked! Destined to be a classic!,"Was planning a trip to NYC to see some shows and bought the soundtracks to a couple of them in order to help me decide which ones to see. Fell in love with Wicked immediately and bought tickets to see it. We LOVED the show and the music is magical. Such a variety of sounds and many of the songs are the kind which you will find yourself humming long after the CD has been turned off. The lyrics are wonderful, too. ""For Good"" will really touch you! If you love great musicals, don't miss this one. Wicked is destined to be a classic!"
5,Pink Goes Good With Green,"""Defying Gravity"" was the very first song I heard from the WICKED production. I was riding home with a friend so after she told me what it was I punched it in on my computer...since then I've been gaining more and more knowledge about the story untill I recently decided I wanted to go see it live in LA. Now onto what you wanna hear about, the music. Oh my god...The music is VERY powerful and moving ((especially in numbers like ""Defying Gravity"", ""No Good Deed"", and ""For Good"")) but it is also light and or comical ((Examples: ""What Is This Feeling?"", ""One Short Day"")). All in all I hail WICKED as a 5 out of 5, and I am anxious to see the production, hopefully sometime soon!!!"
4,Wicked as you like,"For those of us who have seen this amazing show, listening to this soundtrack is like being in the theater all over again reliving the experience.If you loved the show, you will certainly enjoyed this CD with the original cast.Stephen Schwartz who wrote the music for Godspell knows how to make his music very memorable so that you remember it after only hearing it once."
5,"Great, and I am not a big fan of musicals!",I recently had the chance to see this show in London. I am not a big fan of musicals (especially when people spontaneously break into song over something mundane...the likes of 'they got the mustard out!') but this show totally won me over. I was really impressed with the whole thing-the music is quite likeable-even if you haven't seen the show- and the vocals are really amazing on quite a few tracks. I would see this show again-and I'd even take people who are committed anti-musical types...I think it would win them over.
5,Love It!!!!!,The CD has been wonderful. I love it. The songs are fun and my kids and I enjoy singing along!
5,The Best OZ of OZ,The music and lyrics are top drawer. After seeing the show I could not wait to have the DVD album. It keeps me well tuned on an early morning ride to work and leaves me in a great frame of mind for the challenges ahead.
4,Wicked (2003 Original Broadway Cast),"Love it! Makes you a dreamer again. If you loved The Wizard of Oz, as a kid...it's time to grow up and Enjoy Wicked! Good days & bad...there is a song for each emotion!"
5,TRULY AMAZING!!!!!!!!,"wicked is probaly the best broadway musical in the hisory of theater! It puts musicals like ""cat's"" and ""the phantom of the opera"" to shame. belive me you are missing out on a amazing show just by listening to the cast album. Not only is wicked an amazing show but it also teaches you that it's not the way you look or how you dress but that it's the inside that matters. The dioluge is also awsome and tells things abot Oz no one ever knew and you will never look at The Wizard of Oz the same way again. Wicked is a musical that the whole family can enjoy"
3,waiting for the dvd release...,"it can be considered a non-special musical broadway, one more of all the musicals... but it's not. The voice of Elphaba is very rare and moving, it's a surrounding voice.the pitty of this musical: still haven't released it on dvd. What are they waiting for?"
4,Wicked Review,"Saw the play with family and friends. When I saw the CD and price, I thought we could share it and use the music to remind us of various scenes."
2,"A few standout gems, but I think it plays better on stage..","I am so disappointed. After my sister in law saw the show she raved about the soundtrack so I got it. I really do not like it. Aside from a few gems, like ""Popular"", there are no impressive things in this show. The choral numbers and wizard songs sound like an odd mesh of gospel and ragtime. Maybe I am just not a fan of Stephen Schwartz's work. This guy brought us Godspell, Prince of Egypt, Hunchback (which by the way should never have been animated or turned into a musical). I just suggest reading the book or maybe to go see the show, the performers could really turn this mess around. All in all, this show has no charisma and a lot of simplictic and repetitive music that sounds like it was written in the early 80s."
4,A Bit Overrated,"While I'm sure the show is phenomenal, the recording itself is slightly overrated. While there are some amazing tracks such as ""For Good"", ""No Good Deed"", and the amazing ""Defying Gravity"", as well as Indina Menzel in the role of a lifetime, the recording doesn't live up to all of the hype that I've heard. On problem, IMO, is ""What Is This Feeling?"" that, while a fun song, seems a bit pointless and could have easily been scrapped for dialogue as it is so repetitive. The balance also is off. While I think Kristen Chenoweth is adorable, her vocals seem cranked up much higher than Idina's in their duets, particularly ""Food Good"". So, if you want to hear Idina Menzel, you'll have to look for her solos on this recording, because she gets blasted right out. Other than that, it's a fun recording, with a more emotional and powerful second half, which helps it out. I'm seeing the show next October, and I can't wait."
3,Just Okay,"""Wicked"" is a great show, and the songs at first seem exciting and fun, but very soon become annoying and corny. These are the kind of songs that are wonderful when seeing the show but don't translate wonderfully to a listening experience. Luckily, the leading ladies are wonderfully talented and bestow a much-needed vocal talent to the sometimes trite tracks. Meant only for the Wicked-obsessed."
1,Hype Gone Wild,"This is a classic example of people jumping on the bandwagon for a play which despoiled the great Oz of L. Frank Baum, and music which was humdrum and un-memorable. But because most humans are herd animals, it becomes a classic. It even hand a song which goes like this.....[see, Spamalot]."
4,Really Good,I love this cast recording. Kristin Chenoweth is amazingly talented and I love Idina Menzel just as much. The only bad part about this were the Wizard songs. I'm not such a big fan of Joel Gray in this musical and his songs were mediocre.
5,Best New Broadway Score in Years,"Congratulations, Stephen Schwartz. You've written a wonderful score with witty, intelligent lyrics. I've seen the show, and some of the music flew by me a bit too quickly (I loved it nonetheless). What a pleasure, then, to be able to listen to the songs (over and over!) while reading the lyrics in the CD's booklet. Lovely melodies. This is my new obsession. ""I think I'll try defying gravity..."""
3,Good but way too much hype,"When I first got this I thought it was the best musical ever. After a while I found out it wasnt the musical I liked, it was Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth that made it great. Take both of them away and the show is nothing. Idina truly deserved her tony. Even though it is overrated, it def. deserved to win over Avenue Q. The best musical of the year was Caroline, Or Change. If you want a good musical with great talent (except for the little white boy) then buy that instead."
3,Good!,Wicked is good. Idina Menzel does superb as the Wicked Witch! Not the best lyrics..but some are really great.
5,Quickly becomes a favorite,"I bought it after hearing part of defying gravity from a friends and fell in love immediatly. The music is a brilliant turn by stephan schwartz, known for his neverending musical lines. Kristen Chenoweth is hilarious as Glinda, and I haven't even seen the show, the CD makes me giggle. And Idina Menzel, that woman has amazing vocal power, anyone who can belt Defying Gravity after already belting the entire first act deserves her Tony over and over. And then to come back and do it again in the second. Every time I listen to defying gravity I am insprired. And now I can't stop listening. I have converted my family and roomate over to Wicked fans. All it takes is one time through. This is Broadway at it's best. With two of Broadway's rising stars, who could ask for anything more."
3,Beyond the Talent,"This C.D. in and of itself is great. The music is exhilerating and the voices are incredible. BUT, as great as this is talentwise, the plot of Wicked is a just another pity plea. I had a different color skin and they were mean to me.......i was trying to be good...it isn't my fault that it all went wrong. d. We've all heard it before--Ha! You thought i was the villain, but i'm actually the victim!"
5,Wicked = AWESOME!,"If you like musicals, this is one of my all time fav! You would be surprised that it can actually relate to people of all ages, and isn't just like the ordinary pre-Wizard of Oz that you would imagine. I give you my word that this is amazing that I saw it bring tears and smiles to both guys and girls.I know at first my CD got lost in the mail, but they sent me another one free of charge over night with apologies once I told them. I was thankful for this, and know I can rely on future purchases from Amazon.l"
5,Fantastic! Like the bastard child of The Wizard of Oz and Rent...,"This is a fantastic musical. It has a rather traditional structure, and is based on an original novel. It has huge popular appeal, and is at turns heartbreaking and bitingly witty, with knowing references and social critique. It is also refreshing to see Elphaba portrayed not so much as out and out wicked, as misunderstood.It's such a pity we will probably never see a production in this country."
1,Terrible audio on video on demand,"We had to give up after about 10 minutes of watching. The dialogue was completely unintelligible, at least on our late-model TV in a large open living room."
1,Overrated,"I have seen all the versions of The Thirty-nine Steps and while this version is not the worst it is NOT the best. I believe everyone is blinded by the name of the director and cannot see this movie for what it truly is. Overacted is the only word that comes to mind for the performances, The directing is heavy-handed and too dramatic. It's another case of Hitchcock taking himself too seriously."
5,Frommer's Italian PhraseFinder & Dictionary,Awesome book!!! Going to Italy next year and this book will indeed be very helpful!!
5,Great DVDs,This was a very fast shipment...that's great. The DVDs are also in great shape and enjoyed watching the show. To add more words--because I have to--this company is great and there is hopefully no other words to express my gratitude.
1,Unwatchable,"Critics have wondered why this show never got much of an audience. To me it's obvious why people don't watch it. The camera cannot be still. It wiggles, pans erratically (changes speed during the pan, and wobbles), zooms in and out--and rarely comes to rest for more than a few seconds. The jump cuts are constant. I waited until the DVD came out to see this show, and was really looking forward to it. What a shame. Great acting, script, concept. Horrible camera work. The continual, frentic, amateurish, relentless hand-held jerky camera makes you sick, literally. It's probably not as disturbing on a small TV screen, but I have a large projection TV and the show looks like an endless earthquake."
4,If only it didn't endeavor in sports....,"Friday Night Lights would have been a five-star show if it didn't have sports in it. Seriously, the consultants to the sports direction was horrible. All the games had technical issues, and unreal circumstances, almost every other game ends on the last play - this isn't basketball - and even volleyball and basketball shots were stupid. How could they fail in this area so miserably? 8-game seasons in Division III? Clock keeps running when they get a first down???? Just lousy sports direction..."
4,"Great show, pitiful bonus features","I adore this show. I've watched episodes over and over again and I will continue my obsessive viewing of this awesome program.But, much like another DVD set (Veronica Mars springs to mind) of an excellent show, the bonus features (which are like heavenly candy to fans like me) are all but missing. And that bums me the heck out.Deleted scenes (one can't help but to recall Ricky Gervais' comment on deleted scenes ... something along the lines of, ""These are the scenes that didn't make the show because we didn't think they were any good ... "") and a behind-the-scenes featurette.Yes, I've been spoiled by the treasure trove of bonus features on Freaks & Geeks and even Buffy the Vampire Slayer.Buy this set for the show, loan it out and recruit friends to watch this amazing story unfold. Don't buy it if you love commentary from cast and crew or to learn even more about the production and stories."
5,Simply Awesome,"Friday Night Lights is everything television should be. The actors are top notch, the storylines compelling, and simply put this is quality from the beginning to end. The show starts slightly slow in season one, but DO NOT give up on it. If you do you will be missing some of the best natural drama ever seen on television. I can go on and on, but trust me when I say if you like to be entertained then this is by far one of the best shows out there. I look forward to season 4 being released in August."
5,Friday Night Lights First Season,"Do yourself a favor and watch each and every episode from this fantastic TV series! The writing, acting, music, camera work, etc. are all worthy of the ""most awesome"" titles from every category of those award ceremonies. Seriously, the stories don't center on just football. Watch just one hour and you'll be so hooked. The pilot's amazing. There's something for every member of the family in this show."
3,Olvidaron los subs en español,"Everything its ok. But some people forget to include the spanish subs. Thanks!! I can make the effort but in the process whats the problem? Even the can download it frome some web of subs..some check and voila!And for sure, this is a wonderful show!"
1,Friday Night Lights,"Yeah...I got a book. Had nothing to do with friday night lights. Mistakes happen, but that was a little weird."
5,Friday Night Lights Review,"Friday Night Lights is one of the best shows around.I watch it every Friday night,and if I don't watch it live,I watch it later on the internet.I love the show,because it's true to life, and it reminds me of my daysin high school,especially the pep rallies,and the spirit of the team.Ilove the relationship between coach Taylor and his wife Tammie,they haveall the makings of a real marriage.They have a real partnership.I alsolove the kids, Jason,Matt,Lyla,Tim.And I also have a real feeling forMatt's grandma,because she has Altzheimer's,and that is what my wife diedof.I would highly recommmend this show."
2,ug...,"I just had major spinal surgery and bought this to get me through while I was in the hospital.It got one star because it did work to get out the blood, iodine, etc that I was dealing with post-op. It did, technically, clean my hair. And the smell was MUCH better than the alternative.But the residue it left was horrible. There is NO way this product left my hair in any condition to 'style'. It was as if I took a normal shower and didn't rinse out the conditioner.I was in much too fragile of a state to really buff or towel dry my hair, so maybe that was part of the problem.It was worth it to use this once to get out the grime from an accident/illness/etc, but not worth the price after that. For more than $5.50 PER USE, it should've worked better. I wasn't expecting miracles here, but this was really unpleasant.I cannot imagine using this on a normal day like some of the posters are saying. The residue is insane, especially for $5.50 a pop.I would not buy this product again."
2,"Steve Martin, a bust","Really disappointed with these clips. Some were very funny, but overall, it seemed to be lacking the best of Steven Martin on SNL. The SNL TV ad DVD is much funnier than this."
1,Not even close to the best of Steve Martin,Very disappointed in this. It is not Steve Martin at his best. I was looking forwared to seeing some of the SNL sketches from the early days.....these are a BIG disapointment. I've seen his King Tut done much better than the version included in this DVD. Won't watch it twice...I'll be donating this to my local library fundraiser.
3,Made in China,Not high quality. Holes in security bits are not centered which is a problem with the smaller security bits. Definitely worth the price though.
2,Not amazing,"My first purchase came without a bit, just a random bit missing out of the set - returned right away. Upon receiving the replacement set had a problem with one of the bits (the center hole was not very well centered) and found it unusable. Overall, you get what you pay for and for it's about what I expected for the price."
1,The bits that don't fit,I bought these bits the other day but they are such poor quality that they don't even fit the screws they were designed to fit.The end holes are not drilled to any uniform depth and are not even centered on the bit. With such sloppy tolerances these are a complete waste.
1,Bad Quality!,"Bought these for work big mistake. Upon opening these gems I could tell right away they were junk! The center holes in the bits are off center and one is not even deep enough for use on a security screw. Spend the extra money and go for the ""Neiko 100-Piece Security Bits Set with Hard Storage Case"" & ""SMALL TORX SCREWDRIVER SECURITY TAMPER PROOF HOLE T5 T6 T7 T8 T9 T10 T15"" found here on amazon.10x's better quality."
2,Ok Product,Most of the holes on top of the bits are not aligned to the center of the bit. I have to maneuver the bit in order to fit it on the screw I am working on.
2,Poorly Milled bit tips,"About half of these bits are milled off-center so the hole may not always line up with a security screw. Don't get me wrong, I've successfully used them, but I wouldn't use them on something that you really care about. You get what you pay for with tools."
4,Great to have on hand,I bought this item for my husband for his birthday. He loves it!! It is convienent to have in the car or house and it was sent quickly. Very pleased.
2,:(,"Wish I would have shopped around first, because I found this exact item and several other of the same items that I purchased for alot cheaper at Harbour Freught. This set of torque bits were 2.99. I believe I was ripped off by a company that sells other companies items t higher prices, pretty much like people would do at Flea Markets."
5,Great bit set,"I do a lot of security work, and this kit has most any bit you need to do your job. I have not had a single one wear out or break.These bits actually fit snugly into the device or screw. If you have used cheap bits, you know this is important. A loose fit will strip a bit in half a second.Not the case here."
1,worthless,NOT ONE OF THESE BITS FITS ANYTHING i just wasted my time and money on some bits i needed and it fits nothing
2,you get what you pay for was never so true,"I knew there was the chance that I'd be getting junk. Some of the bits will be useable, some may not."
2,"Cheap bits, none in my size.","I was expecting to use this product on 2 seperate items, nintendo and Palm products. Neither of those will work with those bits. The torque bits only go to T-8. I wish there was a chart showing all the size of bits included. Basically I just wasted my money."
3,it worked.,"for some reason the whole set was smaller than i was expecting. I mean, it had all the parts it said it would, i guess I just expected the thing to be larger? Anyway, it worked for what I needed it for (disassembling some baby gear), but the bits didn't really fit in the handle I was using. The bit fell right out, even with the adapter. it was obnoxious, but like I said, it did work."
3,You get what you pay for,"The tools are not machined to tight tolerances so for precision work I think there's a likelihood of getting frustrated and the tools not performing. But for auto and home general maintenance they're good enough. A good idea the manufacturer had was the vinyl case which generally holds the tools in place, and is compact nicely. I put a thick rubber band around the case and wrote 'top' and arrows on the case with a sharpie so I don't open them upside down. And now I just toss the case into my tool bag. The bit sets which come in their own blow-molded cases just take up so much room, I end up putting them all into zip lock bags. I don't have that problem with this set of tools. They should work well for 90% of your applications."
2,"Poor Quality, does not work for PS3","I bought this to open a PS3 which has the security Torx screw. None of these fit. Based on my visual inspection, the quality of the bits are not very precise, so the sharp edges of the torx screw did not work with the dull edges of these bits. Also, the security hole didn't seem deep enough. Disgusted, I just broke out the drill and drilled out the one screw that holds the PS3 cover (out of warranty anyway, so I didn't care)Useless to me, but the carrying case is kinda nice. Maybe it'll be useful opening some other kind of box for me some day, but for now, it'll just sit in the drawer. At least it was cheap."
3,Good stuff by this price,"This set was intended for domestic use, not a heavy use, the steel is not a good (no wonder it is made in China) material, so if you are going to use it at home it is a good choice, is not, I advice not to buy it."
1,What a piece of crap!,33 pc. Security Bit SetAvsolutely useless. Why? Because for the majority of the bits the whole isn't in the center.Keep you hands off! It is wasted money.
5,Top of the Line,This is the book to learn 3D and Direct3D programming. There is even the best C++ introduction I have ever seen in the appendix. It's absolutly great.
1,This book is a paedagogical crime,"Bad english is not an excuse for this [book]. The author presents some code and just begins explaining it from one line to the next, never concerned with trying to give his reader an overview of the founding concepts of 3D.This book is poorly presented, difficult to read, and makes an already difficult topic impossible to understand with senseless explanations, without ever going into the deeper concepts."
2,You get what you pay for,"It comes in 4 sections that are suppose to easily attach to a wall. Well the flags, and Cinderellas hand won't attach to the wall. The pieces don't line up right. If Cinderella's arm is even then Bells dress is off on the other side. It isn't easy to apply and line up being a perfectionist. At least it was less than $12, I would never pay more for it. However, it is cute and my daughter loves getting measured and marking the spot. So overall it's worth it."
5,"Worked very well, easy to change-out","I bought this to replace the Original equipment lamp. It was easy to change, and it seemsto work just like the original. There may be a small communication problem with the tv once in a while. The tv doesn't always instantly reconize the lamp, but it has always come on OK."
2,A book for young would-be managers,"Winnie-the-Pooh fans will, no doubt, love this book, but for others the style may detract from the messages. As for the messages, they are mostly on-the-mark, but border on common knowledge. This may me a good book for a beginning manager, or someone thinking about entering management."
3,Drop the falsetto,"Like several other reviewers, I enjoyed TVOTR's layered soundscape. Songs such as Dirtywhirl and Hours find a great zone, and Bowie fits in perfectly on Province. However, somewhere in the mix there's that bad-Prince falsetto that simply intrudes on several tracks. It's about as professional and welcome as Yoko's wanderings on the White Album. So yes, listen to a sampling of this one before you succumb to all the hype."
2,Turn off the tv on the radio!,"This band is getting alot of critical acclaim right now, but I'm just not feeling it. The single ""Wolf like me"" is the only song that stands out to me on the whole album. It is a great song, but everything else is just blah. I think the band could use a different singer, the guy they got doesn't sing very well or very ""soulful"". The music is good, very original and the only reason I haven't sold the cd yet. I really think ppl need to hear this one for themselves before they buy. Don't be fooled by these 5 star reviews. Just listen to the cd before you buy it. That's my advice."
3,"Good music, grating vocals","Like other reviewers I wanted to like this. The music was interesting and innovative, but I could not get past the vocal stylings to want to listen to this often. Don't see what all the critical hype was about."
4,excellent album,"I only just discovered this album a week ago, thanks to a friend. Sounds great, unique feel, good lyrics, interesting composition. Recommended for fans of Radiohead, The Mars Volta, El-P, and Portugal. The ManIf you're looking to dl a few songs, try Blues From Down Here or Hours."
5,Brilliant irony in the life of this conscientious objector,"This is a piece of Americana that is under-explored: the life of a Conscientious objector. In 1968, Jim Holder, trying to avoid the draft by doing ""alternative service"" as a CO, is sent to work in a Chicago hospital. He has to work for two years and then he's free, but if he is found unsatisfactory and is fired, off to boot camp or prison he goes. He escapes (temporarily?) the clutches of the U.S. government, just to find himself at the mercy of sticky hospital politics. The writing is infused with irony and black humor. ""I thought that by not going to Vietnam, I would have no contact with death, but everyday I carried bodies to the morgue."" Holder is no revolutionary, although we do meet some in the book, and you could say he is not a true CO, because he makes his girlfriend get an abortion, and he is not religious. Yet, he seems like the only sane person in a crazy world."
2,"Great Start, Fizzles and then ZZZZZZZZZZZZ",The book starts off great and captures the flavor of the time period. Then the minor characters in the hospital take over and the idiocy of some criminals and hospital employees in later chapters and the plot and whatever I may care about the protagonist just fell apart for me.
3,"Not my cup of tea, though others may enjoy it","Modernized Celtic music that follows in the path of early Clannad albums -- brisk instrumentals interspersed with glossier vocal numbers and a thumping electric bass or intrusive synthesizer here or there. Talented, it's true, but for the more traditionally-minded among us, this Scottish ensemble may be a hit-or-miss affair. They are more true to their roots on the instrumental numbers -- bad news for folk like me who prefer hearing songs. I'm also not terribly fond of vocalist Kathy Matheson... I guess I just don't like the timbre of her voice, or perhaps I'm just used to hearing a Hebrides accent in a rougher context. This early album is perhaps your best shot to size them up as a proper ""trad"" band."
4,bought iPaw but they sent iBone,"I ordered this as a gift for my son's new dog. I had bought the iPaw before and it was well received. Instead of the iPaw, an iBone (like iPhone) was sent. They loved it as they all have iPhones in their house so now the dog had hers as well. It turned out fine but my only complaint would be that even after emailing to find out why a different product was sent, I never heard back from the seller. The toy is a nice one and the dog likes it."
4,Anime vs the Book,"If you have ever watched this digimon season you might think I don't want to read the book. I thought so too till I read it. For the most part it is just like the series but it's also got a few new things and different things. This book as well as the others in this series are both good. In the anime Kari gets sick, Tai goes and gets medicine. They're attacked and fall in the sewers, Kari gets better without medicine. In the Book she is given the medicine and they move on. The whole battle with Myotismon is different, also. Matt's whole trip to the dark side was short lived. Alot of the things your used to in the series are skimmed over. For the most part it is all from Tai's point of view. If he didn't see it then it's just skimmed over. Not always but he does narrate the whole story."
3,Alright book!!!!!,I thought Flour Babies by Anne Fine was o.kay. It wasn't the best book I have ever read.The book is about a particular form 4c. It is set in a comprehensive school. The Flour Babies project lasted 21 days and it showed how Simon the main character deals with a real life situation of parenthood and how difficult it is to cope with a baby. By having to carry the sack of flour around with him all the time and not letting it out of his sight.[...]
3,Confusing characterization?,"I enjoyed the humor in the story, shown mostly through offhand remarks made by Simon Martin's long-suffering teacher. Simon and his classmates are the students everyone has given up for lost. The principal decides they aren't to be trusted with the materials found in the science lab, and assigns them the ""safe"" science fair project of taking care of a five pound flour baby for three weeks. While this sets the book up to either be hilarious or insightful, it never really pulls of either. There is so little background given on Simon Martin that his miraculous conversion from the local punk into a caring, fatherly person, seems contrived. Definitely the most realistic person in the story is Simon's teacher, who combines cutting sarcasm with a genuine (usually concealed) concern for his students. The story is almost rescued in the end, so it is worth it to keep reading!"
3,Flour babies innit!,"flour babies was good, but not my cup of tea really. Its set in a boys secondary school and in a classroom of bottom set boys, the teacher treats them with no respect at all, and the boys just mess around. Well anyway they've been set a science experiment to look after babies of flour, the boys think that is so girly-ish but simon (the rude boy of the class) takes this seriously and actually looks after the baby seriously and everyone is surprised. But all this baby stuff is making him wandering why did his dad leave when he was a baby( oh yeah simons dad left when he was a baby) So simon keeps on questioning his mum about why his dad left , his mum says he was whistling a song at the time , his mum does'nt know what song , but simon finds out the song but not the last line. Will simon find out the last line? Will he ever know why his dad left? read it to see!!"
5,Best massage tool,"I own many massage tools and this has become my favorite. It wooks very well for the spine, neck, legs, and shoulders. The shape allows you to really get deep into the muscles. It can be used by yourself on yourself easily, and works great on others. It is also very well made!"
4,It didn't suck!,"I really didn't buy the CD for the music but the written material, the music was a plus. It was actually very good. I am die hard Marc Bolan fan and I have nearly all I can get my hands on regarding him. That is why I bought the CD. The music on this is really well done. Sort of Celtic sounding and excellant singing. It is pretty spot on for a Marc Fan!! I would suggest it for a taste of something different. Keep a little Marc in your heart!"
4,Heads have it,this item was purchased for a spoof of a play. it served it's purpose well as the headdress worn by a comic accountant.
5,Great quality!,"I bought the roller and grader for my 3.5 year old son and he loved them both. If your son is into construction machines, these are a must. They seem to be really well made. Definitely recommend."
1,Overrated,"Way overrated! Who said this was the album of the year? The vocals are horrible, the musicianship....HA! Pass on this one."
4,great buy for your handycam,I purchased this for my Sony Handycam DCR-DVD108. Its a great case overall but I have just one gripe. It has barely enough space for all of the cords and cables that come standard with the camera. I have to carry my extra discs seperate because the space is a little tight. Other than that it is a great case.
3,handycam bag,"received bag and at first i thought it was too big, but once we fit all the stuff in it, it was just right. adequate padding for handycam protection."
5,"So comfortable, I bought these in two other colors.","I'm on my feet all day and I have osteo-arthritis, so comfortable is what counts. And these look nice too."
1,don't be fooled,"If you like cheesy sounding tracks go ahead and buy this cd. I found this in the drum and bass section of towerrecords along with Bad Company's ""shot down on sufari"" which everybody knows is one of the best drum and bass albums. However, Y4k mixed by ""the sound of ils"" is the worst cd i've ever listened to. The first and only time i popped it in my cd deck i cringed at the cheesyness. Its a good thing i bought Bad Company's Lp as well otherwise i would have been stuck with the sound of ILS. Don't be fooled on the fancy looking cover and tracklisting. If he had a style of music i'd put it in the worst vocal's i've ever heard category. Don't waste your money on this one! I through it out my car window!"
2,I don't really think it is true,"I am a Zuni and I have read the book and I think some of it might be true, but nostly I think it is false. Zunis in no way look like Japanese. The pictures of the two zuni boys kinda look japanese, Most all of the Zunis look like other indians in the southwest. But I maybe wrong."
3,"An intriguing historical theory, not fully proved","This book develops Davis' theory that some Japanese, possibily motivated by a religious quest, migrated to North America and interbred with Native Americans, producing the people known today as the Zuni. She describes many points of physical and cultural similarity between the Zuni and the Japanese, though she does not provide direct evidence for a voyage across the Pacific. While Davis does not fully prove her case, her anthropological detective work has opened up some interesting leads. Some of this material may seem dry and technical to non-anthropologists. The book is well illustrated in black and white."
3,Helpful for a beginner,"I picked up this guide in order to help me identify, organize, and catalog the value of a stamp collection that belonged to my father. It was actually quite helpful - there are color pictures of US Stamps issued from 1933-1998, and the Scott # is under the picture. Just look up the Scott number in the book to find out how much the stamp is worth. One drawback of the book is that it only goes back to 1933. There are also sections that deal with Airmail stamps and US Revenue stamps, neither with color pictures, though. Overall, a cheap alternative to it's more expensive competitor's."
5,What a story,"Wow, what a family and what a tragic ending. I could not put this book down. The store was heartbreaking for all involved and the writer really went into great detail about the family history and the planning behind the murders. Amazing story. It is a definite recommend for a read."
5,A solo album from one of Austin's finest rotts-rock musician,"""Man vs. Beast"" is the fine premier solo album by Troy Campbell, one of Austin, Texas' best known roots-rock musicians. Campbell, formerly the lead singer of Loose Diamonds, has created an album's worth of dark pop songs, ably assisted by some of Austin's top producers, musicians and songwriters, including Craig Ross, Mitch Watkins, Gwil Owen, Jon Dee Graham and Patty Griffin. There are elements of the Velvet Underground, Big Star, Paul Westerberg and Ron Sexsmith in the album, held together by Campbell's self-assured songwriting, stunning singing and wide ranging artistic vision."
5,Excellent-Maybe my favorite,"I first saw Altan in TN, now I try to see where they are playing in the US and what is close to me. They are fantastic. Never listened to this type music until I saw them. So much enegy, musical ability and perfect voices. I play their music all day at work--it's keeps you calm."
5,Brilliant Design!,"In case you didn't notice, there's a little hole in the center of the spoon that makes skewering the olives very easy. If there's a martini drinker in the house, you gotta have one of these!!!"
3,A relative rating,"Of course, this music is significantly better than most being recorded today. It is powerful and imaginative stuff. But compared to TWL who they are trying to homage, it lacks something. Scofield is a much different player than John McGlaughlin, whom I prefer. I feel their improvisations run too long and are very unfocused, which contrasts dramatically from TWL."
3,Lackluster title.......in other words boring,"Spyro the Dragon was a great title I played as a little girl on the PS.Since then,I've played other games on other systems and I've drifted from the Spyro series.A few days after I received my DS,however,I received this game as a gift.I eagerly started the game with the expectation of it being as I remembered the series to be.I played the game with an open mind,but I couldn't help comparing it to past Spyro games.In other words,I didn't like.The storyline was slow paced and the game simply no fun for me.You save dragons and so on and you learn new moves as the game progresses,but overall,the game is not too enjoyable.I'm not a fan of GBA style graphics but I have to admit that the bakground was very smoothly drawn out.Other than that,I do not recommend this game.But give it a chance if you'd like anyways!"
1,GB-14 Gimbal Bracket for the Lowrance LMS-160 GPS,"Even though the GB-14 Gimbal Bracket was advertized to fit the Lowrance LMS-160, it did not. The openings on the side of the bracket are too small for the oversized knob diameter... this bracket may fit a different Lowrance GPS unit but not the LMS-160."
3,Densely written,"An attempt to divine the mathematical rules governing room dimensions of Palladio's Renaissance buildings using computer software. One must give the author credit for the large amount of research involved, all documented in its extensive bibliography."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!,"A complete and total waste of time and money. Ten more bucks and I could of bought a real ice cream maker. I tried to make ice cream twice, following the instructions precisely and each time I ended up with chocolate milk. It is obvious the unit is designed poorly and the paddle is too cheap and flimsy to churn anything, let alone ice cream. A colossal waste of ingrediants. Wasn't worth the money I ""saved"". In this case, you truly get what you pay for. I am returning this product and never buying VillaWare again. Don't make the same mistake! Save your money or buy a better product!"
2,Not enough freezing power,"I tried to make this work- lowered freezer temperature to -14 degrees F while pre-freezing bowl for 24 hours, pre-chilled the mixture before adding, but did not have the capability to properly freeze the ice cream. I then purchased the Nostalgia Electrics (Blue) Ice Cream Maker here on Amazon.com, and the ""old fashioned"" ice/rock salt method is really the way to go."
2,Like ice gel?,"I used this machine for exactly two batches of ice cream, and actually i thought the ice cream was quite good. Upon freezing the bowl for a 3rd time, I came back 8 hours later to see that it had busted and spread its innards all over my freezer. I called VillaWare and they said that would send a replacement part upon receipt of my broken unit. That was over 5 months ago, and customer service says they're still working on my order. My recommendation is to either go with a higher end machine, or stick to the grocery store."
4,Very nice pillow protector,"I was skeptical about buying these pillow protector covers sight-unseen as I was concerned they would be ""plastic-y"" and it would be noisy and unpleasant to sleep on them. In contrast, they are made of a very soft and flexible fabric and not noisy at all. The surface is velveteen-like, the zipper stitching is small and uniform and overall they seem to be a high quality product. The size is more than adequate to cover a large bed pillow. I did not give this product 5 stars as 1) I can't really tell if they have reduced my allergies (mild) 2) I have not tested whether they are indeed waterproof and 3) I haven't washed them enough to know how they hold up after several washes. Assuming they indeed prevent dust mites and bacteria from breeding and are waterproof and long-lasting, I recommend this product."
3,not bad simular too...,this stuff smells good but it smells exaclty like Paul Sebation cologne. you can pick up a bottle of paul sebation for about 20$ less the the Tiffany brand. both are designer brands. 35$ vs 55$
5,Impressive,"After reading Body Bags, I went straight to the store and purchased this one and finished it the same day. This book was well done by Christopher Golden, with exceptional character developement in Jenna, Hunter, and Pierce. This is a must-read for anyone who enjoys mystery, horror, or suspense and who also has a cast-iron stomach . . . these books tend to be a little disturbing. Even so, Golden is a wonderful author and I can't wait to read Soul Survivor."
4,Obscure gem,"Outside of Tennessee few are likely to have heard of, let alone listened to, Melissa Webb's 1999 self-released debut. But, for those who know Bluegrass pickers, the list of ""friends"" playing on this obscure gem will clue them in that this is not some vanity project.Ms. Webb wrote 9 of the 11 songs on this project, and co-wrote another. Along with her vocals, these lyrics are on the ""folk"" side of the spectrum.Mark Schatz is on bass. Brent Truitt (Nashville session stalwart) is on mandolin here. Kristin Scott (before she married Wayne Benson and added his surname) is on banjo. Husband (or brother?) Keith Webb doubles on fiddle and guitar."
1,dissapointed!!,"I'm a noobie at scanners, but this is now a paper weight on my desk. The description gives the impression that police/fire rescue can be monitored with this unit,when in reality,99% of all municipal frequencies are trunked,which makes this scanner useless to me.Deceptive advertising on Uniden's part."
4,Great reference,"This text provides brief but comprehensive information on theories of motor control and how to apply them to clinical practice. It also discusses normal and abnormal postural control, mobility, and reach/grasp/manipulation. It is a great reference for treatment, especially if you are developing a theoretical framework within which to practice. I recommend it to any student or novice clinician."
5,"Nice fit, good quality","Highly recommend this Hood Vent Cover, nice fit, good quality. Arrived in about 3 days and was exactly what I expected."
2,portability at any costs,"After I saw all the great reviews my expectations were badly shocked when I found what it actually was all about. The sound is all right and once you were it it is more or less comfort (although all cheepest quality) but getting the headphones on is a real fight. Everytime you pull it on it makes greatest attemps to pull as much hair out of your head as possible. It does not stay in the same setting, so once you put the headphones off the metal connection always goes back to its initial condition.Never would have bought that product if I would have known what was awaiting me"
5,Top notch portability and audio quality for a GREAT price,"Looking for a pair of headphones that provide the portability you need for the gym, biking, or shoving into your backpack between classes? Unwilling to sacrifice audio quality for such portability? Look no further, the Koss Porta Pros are for you.Check our my review on my website: [...]HIGHLY recommended!"
5,Very satisfied customer,I was originally looking for a pair of headphones that had excellent bass and that I could wear without having to worry about them falling off my head or constantly needing to be adjusted. I read the reviews and this one caught my eye. I picked them up and got exactly what I asked for! These headphones stick to your head and I can jog with them on and wear them around with no need to adjust them. They fold up too which is nice and the bass is deep which is exactly what I wanted. Another great part is that they were so inexpensive for the quality and come with the legendary lifetime Koss warranty. I give it two thumbs up for the price and value.**UPDATE** Everything I previously said is still true. My only complaint is that after a few months of use the actual headphone cable has started to come apart at the connector end. I'm going to have to send it back for repair as I can no longer hear any sound.
3,"Not a huge fan, jack broke in first month.","I bought them through a relative's recommendation. They sound great with classical and vocals, but the isolation is nonexistant so they are not the best options if you want to listen on a bus."
3,Koss PortaPro,"For the price it sells it's not worth it, even you can fold them, and they have a good bass sound.I decided to keep it, but would not reccommend it unless the price is $ 10.Purchased different Koss model, much happier now, keeping both pairs."
5,The most famous headphone from KOSS. Its true.,"love bass? take this. A very good mid-level headphone. Highly recommend for hiphop music. Im a fan of Eminem, and I always use the Protapro to listen to Mockingbird :)"
4,"Very comfortable, good sound, not the coolest looking headphones...","I bought these as a less expensive replacement for my circumaural (around the ears) desktop headphones and am very satisfied with the quality for the price I paid. The headphones are very comfortable once you get the adjustment down. Sound quality is very good. The sound does bleed a bit making them potentially annoying for your cube-mates (if you like loud/crappy music) and have virtually no external sound muffling effects. They also are not the coolest looking headphones unless your trying for that throwback geeky look. Overall these headphones are a great portable headphone choice, also comes with a nice little bag for stowage, but definitely not a replacement for your primary gaming/music desktop headphones."
4,Especially good earphones for the money,"These earphones sound surprisingly good. They are very light and produce a nice sound. Don't expect these to sound like Bose earphones but they sound much better than my pair of $60 earphones from Sony. They fold nicely but the travelling bag is too tight a fit to make it easy to use. I have also read other reviewers who are concerned about the flimsy plug and I would agree. All in all though, I am certainly happy with ths product."
2,Light & flimsy,These are not what I expected based on the reviews I read & price paid. They are on the flimsy side IMO & do not sound any better than most other cheaper & flimsy headphones I've tried. If I had to do it over again & would have spent more & bought some Grados.
3,Koss Porta Pro,"I believe some folks give these phones unmerited high ratings. Porta Pros are comfortable and they do provide average, but not by any means exceptional. sound."
5,Thumpin cans,"These are the best headphones I have ever owned. I don't buy $250 types but these are great. They are of good quality,portable and sound fantastic!"
4,A company with great customer service,"I'm no audiophlie, but the sound quality from these open-ear headphones is great for the money. As is the case with any open-ear headphone, there is a lot of sound leakage--so it's not amenable for places where you need to be quiet.Be forewarned though, that the thin and sharp metal headband might cause discomfort if the fit is bad.After about six months of rough usage, the plastic clips that hold the two phones together, on the metal headband, snapped. From what I've heard, Koss is great about warranty (and sometimes, even out-of-warranty) replacements."
5,Very Nice,"Got these due to the review on Cnet, and they are pretty sweet. Good bass and very clear sound in the mid and high ranges. I have since found comparable quality with some $20 Skull Candy ear buds (the type that fit inside your ear like ear-plugs), but if you do not like putting something inside your ear, and want great sound these are a very good choice. They do not block out external noise, but you may not want that. My wife uses them on the treadmill while the kids are playing near by, and she is able to hear when she may need to pause for the kids."
5,Better Sound Quality than Sony MDR-NC60 ($200) and many more,"I just bought these headphones after reading many positive reviews about them. These headphones live up to all the 4 and 5-star reviews that people have posted on Amazon and other websites. These headphones have wonderful highs and mids. The bass is a little distorted, but it is still very exceptional for the price!!The headband can be a little annoying, but if you use them frequently you will not notice anymore.I have owned several low-end and high-end (NOT CRAZY EXPENSIVE) headphones...Here is a Few (Bose QC2 [$250], Klipsch image s4 [$80], Sony MDR-NC60 [$200], and JVC Flats [$20])Here is how I rank the headphones in sound quality:1. Klipsch image s42. Bose3. KOSS Portapro4. Sony5. JVCValue for Money:1. KOSS2. Klipsch3. JVC4. Sony5. Bose"
3,it has good sound,"the phone has awesome sound and its small, nothing to complain about.my only concern is that the small black piece that lets you control how big it can be, stopped working after putting the phone on my head the 2 second time... i tried putting it back on the hole that its suppose to be in but that little piece keeps coming off everytime i put the phone on my head... really annoying when it grabs my hair and my hair is less then 1 inch all round."
3,"Lightweight, Sound is great, but the band gets caught in your hair.",i returned this product. The band kept getting caught in my hair. Lightweight with good sound.
3,Sound...AMAZING!! Lousy wire though,"These are without a doubt the best sounding headphones with dazzling quality! I did my homework and read reviews whatevs...The only problem though...Is the wireMy headphones stopped working leaving me twisting until one or both speakers worked.Best bang for your buck for a pair of headphonesCon is the THIN WIRE...Dear Koss, if there is ANY way to strengthen the wire PLEASE let me know!!"
5,Incredible Sound!,"I use them on my cell phone. These headphones will NOT dissappoint! The sound quality is second to none that I've heard. The bass is deep, and the high's are crystal clear. I highly reccommend them!"
2,fragile,"after reading the review i tried these and found the bands easily slipped apart. the sound was just fine, but the last time i used them they broke apart several times and the last time i lost the insert clip and they are now rubbish."
5,Koss Porta Pro's- clean sounding!,"I have had these headphones now for about two years, nice quality of materials and sound, they look some what different then conventional style, they are comfortable once placed on your head properly. Please treat them kindly and give them about 30-40 hours of break in time before passing judgment on their sound quality, after that they will reward you with a positive listening experience. I compare there sound to be very similar to the Sennheiser PX 100-2 headphones with a slightly more emphasis on the Midrange versus a slightly more Bass on the Sennheisers. If you like good clean revealing sound with a little less emphasis on Bass you will enjoy these Koss Porta Pro's, take my word for it! Please see my other review of the Sennheiser PX 100-2's."
3,Good value for the money,"If you want good headphones for this price, go ahead. If you have more money to spend, there are better ones on the market."
3,Make me angry!!!,"I know this has been repeated in reviews many times but let me say it again.Ok, first of all, tisk tisk Amazon.com... Why are these in the ""noise cancelling"" headphones section. These are not noise-cancelling at all...These headphones have great sound... But POOR construction, I felt like they were going to break just by holding them. And they seem to have a spring load effect while trying to put them on which makes them very hard to put on/take off. The earpeices are VERY small and allow maximum sound leakage so everyone on the bus can hear your music.Good sound and very comfortable. These are not noise-cancelling, NOT good design, VERY small, flimsy, BACK TO AMAZON.COM!!If you are not planning on using these headphones for travel or you have a head the size of a grapefruit, then I would reccomend them."
5,Simply the Best Value in Headphones,"For the price, there is simply no other set of headphones that will provide as warm and beautiful a soundspace. It's that simple."
4,good for the money,"Solid specs for the price, but didn't last me very long (only 6 months). I am pretty hard on my headphones, so not surprising."
5,Best Headphones I've ever owned,"I bought a pair of these headphones because I heard good things about them on the internet. Normally, I don't buy headphones until I hear them first. My gamble paid off.These headphones somehow manage to give you great highs with great base. Usually, headphones either give you one or the other. They look like the headphones that would come with a cheap radio...until you plug them in.Admittedly, the design is a little flimsy, but they come with a lifetime no ask warranty, so if they break, who cares? Just send them to get fixed.I plan on buying a second pair soon. The best lightweight headphones money can buy. They sound better than some of the big headphones, and they'll blow any pair of Sonys away."
3,"Sounds good for the price, but it feels cheap","I have an entire collection of portables...the PX100, iGrados, KSC-75s, iCans, and a few other open portables not worth mentioning. The sound is very similar to the KSC-75s (the should sound similar, they use the same drivers) with the bass just slightly boomier. Detail is very good and these work particularly well with rock music. However, they're not quite as detailed as the iGrados and sound a little thin/analytical. The PX100s are much better for hip hop and electronic because there's more energy in the bass. The highs on the PX100s are a little veiled compared to the portaPros. The headband has a cheap feel to it, although I've read these will last years. Folding and unfolding requires attention or else you'll get hair stuck in the headband or, worse, you could cut your finger on the thin metal. Overall, these are very good for the price but for a little more, you can get slightly better sound quality."
5,Koss PortaPro Headphones,"This is the third pair of these headphones that I have owned in the past five years. They are great. The sound is unbelievable, they are not heavy on the head, and for the price, is comparable to headphones that cost two or three times as much. I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for great sound for a great price."
3,Not durable at all,"I purchased these headphones to replace my Sennheisers PX100. For several months I was happy. The sound quality is right up there with the PX100. However, I use headphones pretty much everyday for running, exercising, walking, etc. I need them to last and take a beating. I am constantly pulling on the cord by accident or even dropping my mp3 player detaching it from the plug. Now after maybe 6 months of use I have lost sound in the right ear. It sometimes drops in and out but this is mainly due to the cable being loose inside the earpiece. It is pretty much unrepairable. The Sennheisers also cut out in this same manner but they lasted 2 years. I guess one way you can look at it is that you can buy 3 of these for the price of 1 PX100. I'm not sure if I will try to buy these again yet. It seems that the part where the cable enters the headphone is the weak link in a lot of portable headphones. . . or maybe I am just too rough with them."
4,Quite comfortable,"One of the main reasons why I like these headphones is because of how light and comfortable they feel. It's the only pair of headphones I've ever had where I can leave them untouched without my ears becoming irritated. You basically forget they're there. The sound quality isn't as superb as some reviews made it sound to be, but it's definitely better than most.I haven't understood how to work the ""comfort zone"" switch, and when I try to use it I'm afraid of somehow breaking the headphones. So, that feature didn't necessarily benefit me. I keep it on ""light"" mode, and it's quite fine.Here are my simple pros & cons:Pros:-Comfortable & light-Portable-Retro look-Lifetime warrantyCons:-Very short cord-Fragile-Headband adjustment does not always stay in placeOverall, they're generally a nice pair of headphones, especially if comfort is your main priority."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"After reading all of the reviews of these headphones, perhaps my expectations were too high, but personally I'm disappointed.First is comfort. They ARE quite conmfortable, but not quite as comfortable as the reviews lead me to expect. If you need portable headphones, these are probably the most comfortable you will find, but if you just need phones for working at your desk, you can probably do better. This is really a minor quibble, though, since these are marketed as portable headphones.The sound is another matter. The sound is outstanding except for the bass-- it's overwhelming. Even after extensively fiddling with the eq, they still seem a bit bassy, though they're better.If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't buy these, but they're not so bad that I'd bother to return them..."
2,be careful when using these headphones,"I really enjoyed using these headphones until they broke. I had them for about a year. The reason i say be careful is when you take them off. My left ear speaker broke from its PLASTIC holder. I used glue to put in the slot but now it hurts to wear them. This is a FYI only, not a complaint."
2,"Great Sound, Super Uncomfortable","I was looking for nice headphones for work, and saw all the great reviews for PortaPros. I also travel with headphones frequently, so something that can fold up is a big plus.The sound from the PortaPro Headphones is excellent, especially for the price. Bass is nice and solid and everything sounds crisp and clean.The problem is that I can only comfortably wear them for about 30 minutes or so before my ears start to hurt. I find I'm frequently readjusting these things, which frequently causes my hair to catch in the top band and actually pull hairs out. That just adds to the unpleasantness and makes me more annoyed when wearing them.If you only wear headphones for short periods, these things are great and I would recommend them, but if you're going to be sitting at your desk at work for 8 hours and want a pair of headphones to wear the whole time, these may not work for you."
4,Great Bass,Great bass for a nice compact headphone. Less high end treble but still real nice. For those tired of ear buds.
2,headband is poor quality,"headband broke right out of the box. overall sound quality is good, no complaints there. but this product feels very cheap . loss of hair from use is also very true. I do not recommend this product at all!!"
1,Won't Ship To Military,"I wouldn't know how to rate this product! I am an active duty marine stationed serving in Iraq. I wanted to order a set of headphones so I could listen to music at night. I tried to order them and AMAZON won't ship the product here. This part is the best: The address we use in the military to get mail is the same as an address in the US. It costs the same for the sender. There is ABSOLUTELY no reason to not ship to APO AE address. At least I wasted my time looking through all the products just to find out I can't order from you. Since i only have a limited time I can use the internet, perhaps you could put a new sort category that would identify who will ship to servicemen in Iraq."
4,great sounding headphones,"I was replacing a set of apple earbuds that couldn't handle going through the dryer, and decided on these after checking out reviews on cnet for best headphones under $50. The sound is phenomenal. There is plenty of depth and detail. The bass is powerful and tight without being overwhelming. Highs are sweet, not biting. Overall, a nice balanced sound. Very comfortable. Stylish? Not so much. But knowing that these things haven't changed much since '84 yet are still held in high regard is pretty impressive. I'll take a product with a track record like that over the next cool-looking thing that doesn't sound or feel near as good."
3,"Excellent sound, superb comfort, lacking low-end bass.","Not a bad pair of headphones at all. Excellent sound quality all across the spectrum except it leaves something to be desired for on the low end of the frequency spectrum. Once you get below 60hz it really begins to taper off quickly the further down you go in freq. It's defintely high quality bass sound, not muddy, just soft. Extremely comfortable! I just expected these to have better bass response than they did."
3,Not as good as other reviewers say,"These headphones are ok, but they look cheap, since they are, and I didn't notice much difference in the sound quality from my sparkplug's to these. I couldnt wear these for more than an hour without them hurting my ears, but for the price you could certainly do worse. Honestly though, if your willing to go to in ear headphones, go with the spark plugs, the are better at noise isolating, fit better in your ears, and I really cant notice a diffrence in sound quality + they're like half the price."
4,Great everyday headphones!,"For the money, pretty amazing. Lightweight, portable, comfortable, and good sound. The look is kind of love it/hate it. Personally, I am a fan. My one complaint is that there is some amount of noise leakage to the external environment. Certainly not enough to regret the purchase, but enough to dock it a star."
4,Great Headphones for a Great Price,"These headphones sound great for being only $33. The only thing I've found that I don't like about these headphones is when I walk into a strong headwind I can't hear my music... yeah, that's about it. Sometimes I imagine that there is static in the sound, but I just think I want to find something wrong with them."
4,Fantastic Product,"I am writing this review because it was thanks to the many number of positive reviews on this product that I purchased the headphones to begin with.The sound quality is truly incredible by any standard, regardless of price...the relatively low cost of the headset just sweetens the deal. I listen to all different kinds of music and the key to this headset's awesomeness is its ability to distinguish between sounds. You can literally hear each instrument in a song, and each sound at a tone that was probably intended by the artist. However, I gave this product 4 stars because it feels cheap and the adjustments on the band make putting the headsets on a bitch. I am a Tron fan, so I like the look.I will leave you with this experience...I am a huge Pink Floyd fan, and the first song I listened to when I got the headset was ""Shine on You Crazy Diamond."" As soon as I heard Gilmour's opening solo, I knew I had made the right purchase and quickly forgave this product's shortcomings. BUY THEM."
1,Great Sound but fragile,Love the sound though somewhat ugly. My main complaint is that they broke when I dropped them off a table. The manufacturer uses cheap plastic to connect the earphone pads to the body. Not only did it come apart but now only one of the ear pieces is working. There are other headphones out there with decent sound for the same or less money with much better build quality.
5,"""Tony Bennett is right on...K.D. Lang is a National Treasure","Canadian born Kathryn Dawn Lang is ""pure talent""...as this album gives you the insight of her many hit songs...having a purity tone in her voice, reminds me very much of the late Ella Fitzgerald and Patsy Cline...her style makes the difference as you listen to ""CRYING"", the big hit of Roy Orbison, who also composed the song (which was recorded in 1987 as a duet with Orbison)...we need to mention some stand outs ~ ""BIG BONED GAL"", ultimate country...""BLACK COFFEE"", great jazz standard...""DON'T SMOKE IN BED"", serving up a torch singers ballad...the list could go on...entire album is a WINNER!Remember my album that I played over and over again ~ ""Absolute Torch and Twang"", just about wore that one out...if you're a fan this latest release from Lang is a must haveTotal Time: 53:26 on 14 Tracks ~ Warner Bros. Records 9-48108-2 ~ (2001)"
4,lang's Voice Stands Out Among Contemporary Pop Artists,"Until Live By Request, I had never purchased a k.d. lang c.d.. Long a Tony Bennett fan, I had the pleasure of seeing Tony with k.d. in concert two weeks ago. k.d. lang could very well be THE best voice in pop today. Her quirkiness, I believe, is the only thing that has held her back from being bigger than she is. Sadly, some of her material is rather quixotic. On the right song, however, there's none any better than lang.Live By Request opens with the upbeat, addictive tune ""Summerfling,"" off lang's last c.d. ""Invincible Summer."" Among other highlights are her stunning versions of Roy Orbison's ""Crying"" and Peggy Lee's ""Don't Smoke in Bed."" Also included are her hits ""Constant Craving"" and ""Black Coffee.""I would say that this, among any other, is the one k.d. lang c.d. you should buy. It's highlights her catalog and it's quite a performance."
2,Soulless,"She has a great voice, the songs are good songs and the band is very competent but the record just doesn't work. It is just plain boring like kd is phoning it in Maybe an off night for her, I don't know but this CD ain't worth the price of a blank."
1,Zero Stars!,"Christopher Anderson writes an awful lot of books about very famous people in an unflattering light. I wonder what skeletons lurk inside the author's closet to have made him so mean-spirited, so lacking in conscious, and such a pathetic human being. Barbra will always be great and long remembered. But Christopher what's his name(?) not a chance!"
1,You've got to be kidding...,I wish I had spent my money on something better written. It amazes me that this can get published yet so many other authors complain about the lack of opportunity. But I was stupid enough to buy it so I guess that is my answer. Save your money or donate it to a worthy cause.
1,No Redeeming Qualities Whatsoever!!!,"I can't say much about this book except that I hated it so much I couldn't even finish it. This book has no redeeming qualities whatsoever! It's mean-spirited and only intent is to tear Barbra Streisand apart and for that I see no point. If your looking for a good book, look elsewhere. If your looking for ""something Barbra"" choose any of the many offerings from her extensive catalog. Good riddance to this one!!!"
5,A Sensitive Microscope on the Bigger than Life Barbra,"Barbra, a superb portrait of a complex, difficult and fascinating talent, like all of Chris Andersen's work, is a beautifully crafted page-turner. In tracing Streisand's tumultuous life and achievements, the reader also receives an added bonus-a sharp sense of the panoply of evolving worlds in which she has interacted-the artistic, the political and business, Holltwood style. In short, the bigger than life Barbra Streisand is brought to life on a world stage by a world class biographer. If you assume we're Chris Andersen fans, your right.Dick Anthony"
1,Irresponsible story-telling!,"Christopher Anderson is an obvious bully who has taken his cutting pen to defame an enigma. Those of us who have been with Barbra for a while are well aware this is not the definitive Streisand biography. Additionally, it is not even worrth the read. When does such antagonistic attacks change a work from non-fiction to fiction or even science fiction for that matter. This kind of story-telling not only defames its subject but defaces the First Admendment which was created so as not to oppress the truth. His kind of lie-telling greatly stretches beyond those boundaries and abuses a right in an irresponsible manner."
2,"As Barbra sang once "" I 'm still here""","I started reading the book last night, so by the few pages I have read so far, I can agree with many people in the sense that no matter what people write about Barbra, those who love her - as I do - will not change our minds for reading some biased book. Are we humans? Yes, and for that reason we are far from perfection and eager to achieve it, so what's the point? As long as people like him continues talking or writing about Barbra, we, Barbra's fans, are happy to see that her name and her work are still something that people like him envy. I wonder if anyone will ever think of writing about him ( except when he writes about other people). We have to thank Barbra for still being here with us, in spite of every piece of comment that people make of her and her art, because, after all, WE ARE THE LUCKIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD FOR HAVING BARBRA !And yes, she is not perfect, but does that mean that we are not allowed to love imperfection?"
1,Barbra,This book was boring.I could not finish it I only read about 25 pages and gave up.I have read other books by Christopher that were very good but this one just about put me to sleep. I hope Barbra writes her own story real soon I would love to read it.
1,"Absolutely no new facts, no new insights","This Christopher Andersen character is a mercenary writer who simply pops out a book on whomever happens to be popular at any given moment. Diana AND Diana's boys, Jackie AND Jack, but he was bound to run out of material, and now he's turned to Streisand. The result is a droning, uninteresting piece of People-style journalism with absolutely no new personal revelations and more importantly, no new insights into Streisand the cultural icon, or Streisand the artist. Bland. There's nothing in this book that wasn't covered first in Randall Riese's ""Her Name is Barbra"", then in James Spada's ""Streisand: Her Life"" and finally in Anne Edwards' ""Streisand: Her Life."" These three 400 page books cover all of it with much more detail and insight than Andersen."
3,Just OK,I wanted to start Tai Chi. But I found that this video is a little frustrating. Maybe I just need a private teacher. Or maybe Tai Chi isnt my thing.
3,"worthwhile,but barley","I really anticipated this video being a die-hard fan of the Bea tles.But there is precious little new information and footage.There is too much commentary from people that I am not interested in. This reinforces my feeling that the producers needed something to fill in the gap.The video runs about 60 minutes and at times fleshes out film we are all familiar with but very briefly.If you are new to the Beatles or have a casual interest and don't want to spend the money for the Anthology ,you might enjoy this.As for me this was just a momentary fix!"
2,OK for very light use,"This shredder is ok for very light use, but even moderate use overloads it. We shred all all our junk mail, and that often overloads this shredder. It overheats easily and is slow. Our died after about three years. Buy this only if you have very light shredding needs. Otherwise, get something a lot heavier duty that will last."
5,"Review of ""Request for Proposal.."" Book purchase",The book arrived in good condition and within the the stated time frame. I am very happy with my purchase.
2,Entertaining if you can get past the writing,"Summer Sleep-away is the story of 12-year-old Mattie Kleinfeld, who leaves his bickering parents behind to attend his first summer of sleep-away camp. After crying himself to sleep on his first night, Mattie predictably learns to love camp as he makes new friends, falls in love, and embarks on an adventure that combines his family's personal history, a treasure hunt, and baseball. (What boy could resist that?) While entertaining because of the experiences that Mattie has and the people he meets, however, I feel like the novel might be a better short story. The writing is oftentimes awkward and predictable, and in need of editing/tightening. (And was anyone else troubled by 12-year-old boys and girls sleeping--just sleeping--together, and swimming near-naked together?)"
2,"Feels dry, sits on top of skin and can rub off, bad texture","This lotion I was eager for due to its ingredients of Beta Glucan, which I take internally for immune support, and can also reduce scar tissue. Unfortunately, it is very thick, but not moisturizing. My skin feels tight and dry within minutes of using it. It gets worse overnight. If you use too much, it kind of beads up and rubs off. Does not sick or, does not feel emollient. It is not irritating, I do not get red or burn from it, so that is good. I use it as a body lotion, but at $28 for 2 ounces, it is not worth it. Your better off with Origins or something else."
3,"no instruction, not made in Japan","This watch looks ok, but I can not find any instructions on how to use it.I don't know what is the button used for, where is the power indicator?I bought two of this watch as gift, they were bought in different time, but both looks like used one, not like new, I never see the original string tag which show SKA312."
5,More than I expected,I ordered 2 of these and I got more than I expected. I got the right product but it was the 50% more in the container. I still have the original one that I use now and am only half way through it.
5,"Excellent, straight-forward guide","This book is a must for anyone that wants to get started with his or her investment portfolio or take it to the next level. The author covers a lot of material and a broad spectrum of investment options in a pretty short space, making sure that the reader understands the basic principles of the investments and a few of the finer points that savvy investors should understand. The book manages to both explain concepts thoroughly and not make you feel like the author is speaking down to you, which is a hard accomplishment to manage. I think that is why it works so well for beginners and also people that are a little more comfortable with financial concepts. I found the book quite easy to understand and that it flowed quite well. I was fairly confident in my investment portfolio, but this book has made me realize that I could be doing a lot more and I am excited to get started."
1,Some episodes won't play!,"I love this series and had been looking forward to getting the complete set! Unfortunately, some of the episodes skip and some absolutely refuse to play and cause my DVD player to freeze. I tried playing them on a different DVD player and had the same problem. Amazon sent me a new set free of charge and I'm having the same problem. I guess I'll have to send this one back too :("
3,it WAS great to receive my collection,"It was great to get my collection, but once i started watching it i found out that the 30% of the CD's where scratched...and i could not see them in my TV, or computer.I don't know if its because of the packing, but i was very desapointed after this... the rest of the product was ok after this point.."
5,Have it All!!,"If you were a fan of ""Sex and the City"" then you'll appreciate having the complete series at your fingertips. Love love love the girls (and guys) and love New York."
2,Bad DVD quality,"Bought this as a Christmas present for my fiancee. Upon finally completing the set, she noted that about 30% of the discs do not play everything on the discs, with some discs refusing to play at all. At first, I thought it was because the DVD player she has is older, but after trying the discs in three others, none of them play correctly. The discs themselves don't look to be scratched, but they don't play nonetheless. HBO should replace all defective discs, instead of taking the ""we haven't noted any problems"" stance, refusing to exchange discs."
1,no dvd extras....why bother?,i don't understand why when you can see this show all the time on demand one would buy this set when there are absolutely no extra features on this set. it's overpriced and a rip off. the whole point is to get some extras.
4,The life in city,"For most people from city, live in country now, those stories are interesting, and still warm there. I like it."
1,Defective,"My first set of DVDs was defective. So, I sent them back. The second set was defective as well! This is not the fault of Amazon but rather of HBO home videos! And, they wonder why people like to buy bootleg copies...! My friend bought bootleg copies in China that work just fine. I try and buy the full-price collector's set, and almost none of them played!!!"
1,Like a giant pink warning sign on the shelf,"I'm sure glad women can pick these up and display them proudly in their DVD collection. It serves as the perfect date-based warning sign. If I see this on the shelf, I know that it will be the last date I'll ever go out on with this lady. I can't think of a show that epitomizes more a melding of decadent over-the-top feminism with materialism quite like this series.Thanks SITC!"
1,DVDs do not work,"I was excited to receive this DVD set, as I just started watching the show....when it arrived, I was saddened by the first episode that skipped, angered by the second episode that did not play at all, and now completely disappointed that each disc has at LEAST one episode that does not play, and/or skips most of the episode. Very disappointed."
2,annoying,I am really annoyed by some of the cds. I can't play some of the episodes because it says the disks are damaged.
1,Buyer Beware!,"Amazon is currently selling each of these seasons individually for $20.00 each, give or take some pennies. That's $140.00 for all seven packages. They're also selling the excellentSex and the City - The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)for about $200 -- and though sometimes that price inexplicably drops or goes up by a few bucks, I've never seen it go as high as $220, which is the price they're currently asking for this one ""collection"".If you actually purchase all of these, in their flimsy plastic packaged glory for $220.00 when you could get the entire thing for as low as $140 by simply buying individually, the more fool you. Here's hoping you're too smart to make that mistake. And that Amazon.com will STOP DOING THIS, as this is the third time I've caught them inflating the price of a DVD collection when they come cheaper on their own."
2,"Good Show, bad packaging and video quality","I bought the set for my wife. We both think the show is great. But I was not happy with the paper/cardbord inserts and packaging. Also, starting with the third season, the video is too bright. I had to turn the brightness all the way down on my Samsung DLP TV and it is still a bit washed out. Some of the disks were scratched."
4,sex and the city collection,"i've always loved and watched all the episodes of sex and the city on tv. now, i can watch it anytime i want!:) its great owning it at home."
1,do not buy,This product is cheaply made. I went through two sets and was unable to view several disks because they were damaged in both sets.Amazon handled the issue well by paying to ship the sets back and gave me a full refund.THANKS AMAZON
1,"DO NOT PURCHASE, YOU WILL REGRET IT!","DON'T BUY THIS!!!! JUST GOT MY SET FROM AMAZON AND SURE ENOUGH WHEN I STARTED TO TEST OUT THE DISCS BY SEASON 3 EPISODES WERE NOT PLAYING. THIS SET IS DEFECTED AND PLAYS ON MY COMPUTER AS THE SUPPOSED NEW SET. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN RE-PACKAGE THE SAME 2005 SET AND CLAIM IT TO BE NEW. I WANT A REFUND FROM AMAZON. I'M NOT GOING TO PLAY THE EXCHANGE GAME, HBO NEEDS TO DO A RECALL."
1,Sex and the City - The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset),I purchased the collector's giftset for my wife and the DVDs are bad. Some play normal and others skip or do not play at all. Be careful. I am sending the second copy back to Amazon.
2,Not so great...,Some of the discs didn't play all the way through and the packaging wasn't complete. I probably wouldn't have bought the series without the complete packaging.
2,Do Not Recommend,"I was a little worried about purchasing this set because I had read the reviews from previous buyers saying there were problems with the disks. These reviews, however, were from around 2006. I was thinking that it didn't make sense that a product would still be sold to customers, 6 years later, knowing that it was faulty. Well I did not get through the entire series, but still came across two faulty disks from two separate seasons. The one episode would not play and all and just returned to the menu. The other, skipped and froze so much that it was not worth watching. It is very unfortunate that this problem has been known for so long, but yet the product is still being sold."
4,Hate skipping an episode during a marathon!,Most of the discs played but there were a couple that had certain episodes that wouldn't play or wouldn't play the whole thing just the beginning. That's awful especially if you are watching Sex and the City for the first time and when doing a Marathon. I really wish I could have watched all of them but I still love the series!!!
1,waste of time and goldan globes,"i admit that this show has won some prestigious awards, and evidently people like it for some odd reason. in my opinion, the show is firstly, not a comedy in its literal sense i.e. if you are expecting to 'laugh' you wont get anywhere. secondly there is somehow no point to the show, all 4 women (okay except charlotte) have dated and slept with some million men or so; are supposedly profession women who manage to eat out every other day and party late night (never seen a lawyer working 80 hrs a week with a child do this!). the show, in my opinion, is pretty much pointless as well as hopeless!!"
1,Kill Your Television,"You've seen the bumper stickers that say, ""Kill Your Television"". Shows like this are why."
2,"Great Start, Disappointing Finish","Although I was initially impressed with the Sex and the City - The Complete Series on DVD, the slick format with the chapter information, and the compactness of the Giftset, I've since been disappointed by the quality of the product.It has taken me some time to get through the DVDs, and as a result, I have only recently found two of the discs to be defective (one will not play specific episodes, the other simply stops repeatedly in a jumpy fashion and will not allow me to get to the end of the episode). Unfortunately, as a person working normal 9-5 hours, I was unable to watch all the discs early enough to discover the problem discs until the 30 day full-refund period had elapsed. With a full refund no longer possible, I would be cautious in future in purchasing Amazon items which include multiple DVDs, and would caution others against buying the Sex and the City Collector's Giftset for this reason."
3,It's pretty but...,"Let me just start out by saying that I love Sex and The City. LOVE IT. However, I am so disappointed with the new set. I waited to have this one and am not thrilled with cheap cardboard slots that the precious discs are stored in. With repeated ins and outs, they will get scratched and no matter how careful you are, it will be inevitable. And the PAPER?? Come on!!! There is alot of good stuff, but overall, I wish I'd gotten the other one a month ago and had all this time to enjoy it."
1,DVD's don't play,"The package came and was supposed to be brand new. It looked repackaged and just like the others disappointed reviewers, it wouldn't play in either of my dvd players skipping and freezing up."
1,Disappointed,"I was so disappointed when I got the Sex and the City complete series for Christmas. There were multiple episodes that would skip and some would not play at all. I thought maybe it was my dvd player, but I tried another one and it was the same thing. I even tried it on my computer, but that did not help. I thought maybe it was a fluke and I sent it back and got a new one, but I still had the same problems. I love watching this series and it makes me sad that I can't watch every episode without it freezing or skipping :("
2,beautiful case poor quality dvds,"this set of season shows for sex in the city is beautifully packaged and in a very user friendly - keep it organized - package --unfortunately almost every disc has an episode - or several - that will not play properly ie - sound stops, video stops, wont play at all - it is so sad and frustrating :( cleaned dvds- even tho they are new - checked dvd player - it works great..... gave up - not through all the seasons yet - but it just keeps happening.."
2,Disappointing audio,"Sex and the City - The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)I was very dissapointed that I spent over $130.00 for this and was told that I was receiving a ""new"" collector's giftset. Turned out this is a ""used"" giftset! Very misleading in the advertising!!!!! The audio is awful on Season's 1-4! Make sure you get the ""new"" giftset if you order this!!!! This was no gift!"
2,should have listened to the other reviews!!,"messed up DVDs....more than one. Horrible quality, should have saved my money. Cannot watch about half of the episodes."
1,DVDs were damaged,This set arrived on time but many of the discs were damaged. The liner notes that have episode summaries were not in order.
2,Check that you have all discs and no duplicated discs!,"My rating is in regards to HBO being stupid, I bought (July 2009) this as a x-mas gift for my girl friend and the 2nd to last DVD (Season 6; Part 2; Disc 2) was missing and in its place was (Season 6; Part 1; Disc 2) which my girl friend had previously just watched and of course complained about because apparently it had some important episodes being the last DVD.So if you do buy this make sure it has all the correct DVD's when you get it.Luckily, Amazon.com Customer Service is the best customer service and they are sending in a replacement."
1,Manufact. Defects! Many episodes dont play.,"Shame on the manufacturer of the 2005 copyright of the complete series of Sex and the City. I finally bought the set after my cases totally fell apart on most of my seasons. I have returned two series sets because whole episodes and WHOLE ENTIRE DISKS dont work. And not just in my dvd player, but in my laptop and in best buys dvd station (where i took the set to exchange) It is a factory malfunstion and I was dissapointed to see that there are posts coming from years back that had the same problem. I am a HUGE fan of the show, and yet I cant BUY a gift set that works! None of them DO!!!!I am going to look for the newly copyrighted set and see if HBO ever changed vendors. I am getting very dissapointed however."
5,Great set,Great price for what you get. Packaging is super cute and you get all seasons. I couldn't be happier with the purchase. Also makes a great gift.
3,Not sure if this is the 2005 or 2007 release,"Like others I purchased the cheaper option between the $196 and $109 listings. I just received the item and although I haven't opened it yet, it looks exactly like my friend's 2005 version (faux velvet cover, spiral book, discs, etc.) and the label mentions 20 discs. However I wanted the new 21 disc release with movie coupon. Amazon's going to try and ship out another item incase the old one was sent by mistake. We'll see. At any rate, this one is cheaper than the other listing."
2,Faulty Discs,"As other reviewers have mentioned, several discs in this set do not work. I received SatC: The Complete Series as a Christmas gift, and it took me a while to go through all the discs, so I did not notice the problems within the 30 day window. A few months later I was frustrated to discover that some discs would not play at all, so I called Amazon and they let me send it in to exchange for a new set. I had the same problem with Round 2 so I returned it within the 30 day window and used the credit to give the Deluxe Edition a whirl. I'm much happier with that one. All the discs work - yay! Yes, it can be a little tough getting the discs in and out of the holders, but overall I like the presentation of the deluxe set much better, and it's nice knowing that I can pick an episode to watch with no anxiety about whether or not it will play."
4,"Poor quality, great series!","So I bought this item trying to avoid the customer reviews of 'poor quality of disks.'As I started watching, when I was in second season the episodes began to freeze, i was playing the disks on my DVD Player, however, everything looked just fine when I started watching on my Blu Ray Player.I love the package! It's beautiful. So I highly recommend it, just be sure to play the disks con your Blu Ray!"
5,Torx Floor Board Screws Work Great,Needed to replace the flooring on an old trailer. Original screws snapped off when trying to remove them. These did a great job of securing the new plywood to the trailer.
2,what's she saying?,"If you like droning music with the volume turned up just loud enough to drown out the highly-processed voice of the lead singer, you've come to just the right place!This is probably the first CD I've heard where the backup singers are actually louder than the lead. Probably just as well."
5,The best male voice out out of Canada since Stan Rogers,"There are singer/songwriters aplenty these days on the folk scene, but few put together the whole package like James Keelaghan. The tales he spins, not only on Recent Future, but on his other albums as well, are reminiscent of Stan Rogers' marvelous stories. After a year, this CD is still at the top of my playlist."
4,Some overtones but controllable,"Struck normally, this triangle gives off lots of overtones. However, for quieter moments in my orchestra, I am able to get more delicate sounds. This triangle is large, possibly larger than most people need. But I like it."
3,Manson is NOT a Serial Killer,"The chief reason why I gave this otherwise well-made collection/series 3 instead of 5 stars is because they decided to include Charles Manson, which would've been fine had the collection been focused not on serial killers but on bizarre cults. Manson is not a serial killer. His was a ""fly by night operation"" at most. More along the lines of spree/mass killings. A & E should know better. They should've instead included Ted Bundy or the Hillside Stranglers. THEY are ""serial killers"" in the ""proper"" sense of the word. I'm not making this up, it's just reality."
3,"Good fiction, but depressing","I enjoyed reading this book, but it seems that nothing good can ever happen to the hero and heroine in this story, leaving me feeling really depressed after I read it."
3,must satisfyDeath is Now my Neighbor,Cleverly constructed who-dunnit but ultimately too clever by half. Morse and Lewis are well-drawn but the other characters are sketchy and without substance.Street names and district identification may satisfy Oxford readers but are used as an excuse to portray a change of venue rather like a TV script.
2,Disappointing,"The main event the four way elimination match between triple h,the rock,mick foley and big show is ok but could have been alot better.The table ladder match between dudley boys,edge and christian and hardy boys is the best match on the ppv by far.All the other matches are boring.Dont buy!"
2,Not worth buying,"The bast match on this DVD was definatelly the 3 way tag team match, The Swantom Bomb at the end was amazing.There was also an ok Hardcore match but it was only ok.Every other match was pretty bad, When Mick Foley missed the table on his last match ever it made me laugh so hard.I would recommened buying Summerslam 2000 or ECW Path Of Destruction insteed."
3,WM 2000,"This tape has one of the best matches EVER in WWF history, but nothing else really lives up to the Wrestlemania name. The ladder match has some incredible spots like a 3d off the top of the ladder, a senton bomb off the top of a 20-foot ladder, a 450 miss onto a ladder, I don't know how these guys still walk or think straight after going through this match. But beware, it isn't worth the 30 dollars. The much hyped four-way elimination match is not that great. Mick Foley uses fake barbed-wire, and slams his ribs on the announce table going for an elbow drop. Jim Ross is usually a good announcer, but he just screws the match up after HHH piledrives Rock on the steel stairs. And of course, at the end of the match, you could see it coming, Vince screws Rock out of the title with a chair.If you want to see a good Wrestlemania, get 14."
5,Painfully beautiful.,"Tabor is a rare artist, and one that performs complete the songs when she records them. The song, ""He fades away,"" a song about an asbestos sickened minor, brings tears to the eyes. ""Pavanne,"" a Richard Thompson cover, is chilling (which is fitting considering the protagonist is a terrorist). The instrumentation is wonderful also. Yup, highly recommend it."
3,Not useful to an amateur,"I was looking for a book on make up for my wedding. I thought Face Forward would be more practical, but the make up is way too elaborate and fantastical."
4,Photographers point in this review,"From a photographers point of view, this book is a great addition. In that it gives the photographer and the MUA some ideas of what's possible.. I don't recommend it for new MUA, since it offers no how-to's on how they acheive that look."
5,Amazing,"Kevyn Aucoin is amazing! The transformations in this book are awesome. Martha Stewart into Veronica Lake. A man into Linda Evangelista. Gwyneth Paltrow into James Dean. I like this book even better than Making Faces. Kevyn Aucoin turns makeup into magic, and he does it brilliantly. It's also very educational to someone who's studying beauty, as has individual sections dedicated to different effects, different parts of the face, different tools, etc. This book is very entertaining, and also very helpful. I love it!"
5,Great Condition & Speedy Shipping,"Very interesting book for costume makeup, but not so much daily wear. Still has the signature Kevyn Aucoin style, however would have liked to see more looks. Still an informative book."
5,Wow!,"Kevyn Aucion is a genious! I've only flipped through this book, but you would not believe what Kevyn can do with a box of makeup. The most amazing transformation I saw in his book was Calista Flockheart made to look like Audrey Hepburn. An amazing book!"
2,Kinetic battery / capacitor needs replacement,"The watch looks nice. But if you search online, ""seiko kinetic battery replacement"", you'll see that these things need the battery replaced in a few years (mine is 4). I don't have this exact model, but on mine, I know the battery / capacitor / whatever is about to die because the charge indicator button only shows 20% as the maximum.Supposedly, mailing it to Seiko will run you a pretty high price. *why* for a mass market watch... This is NOT a high quality product only because of the battery.The rest of the watch takes a lot of abuse and is waterproof."
2,"Decent plot, no sympathetic characters","This book is reminiscent of the old 50s hard science fiction, where the science is believable, but the characters are cardboard. Even with half of the book devoted to flashbacks to explain the motivations and personalities of the various crew members, not one character is sympathetic or memorable. It is difficult to root for anyone to get off the planet. An earlier review suggested that the book had a surprise ending. (Note: Semi-spoiler to follow!) It is telegraphed about a third of the way into the book which of the crew would make it to the polar area. Even the ""surprise"" person who sacrificed him/herself was easily predictable.Mr. Landis' short fiction is excellent, and he should stick to that format."
1,Very Dissapointing,"I really have nothing good to say about this book, so I'll keep this short. The characters are horrible, cardboard cliches. The plot is dull, and completely devoid of any exciting moments. And worst of all, the descriptions of Mars itself are utterly uninspiring. A brand new, never before explored terrain, and the author can barely string three sentences together about it. Avoid this novel at all costs."
2,"I tried to like it, but...","The author handles the technical aspects of the story well, but the character development is sophomoric at best. Wish I'd paid more attention to the negative reviews before purchasing it."
3,good,"blaze foley was quite a character and it shows in his songwritting. this is a nice collection of live material by foley and has the classic old texas country sound. his lyrics are clever and witty and sometimes sincere. it is interesting to hear the viewpoint on the world from a man like blaze foley through his music. some standout tracks would include 'clay pigeons' (covered by john prine on his newest album, 'fair & square') and 'faded loves and memories'. if you like acoustic country and good songwritting then go for it and buy the album. the best part is that the proceeds benefit the homeless in austin, tx. so you can do some good while you enjoy the music."
1,Very poor,"Lee follows a stream of conciousness/dilettante approach to literary criticism that fails, time and time again, to get to the key issues."
3,3 for the music 0 for the package,"This set is EXACTLY the same as 2000's Anthology which was itself a condensed version of the boxed set Soulsation.No quibble with repackaging the music and rereleasing it.It's just that this exact set exists in at least 10 other configurations. How about releasing the J5 Live in Japan, or Jermaine, Jackie and Michael's solo albums domestically. What a way to respect the J5 legacy."
2,this is going in the hardly-ever-play bin,"I've been a Pentangle fan from way back. I started collecting albums in the 70's after I first heard 'Solomon's Sea' and 'Sweet Child' . Between Jacqui's voice and the intricate guitar work that John Renbourn added....I was a goner. But much of this is missing from this album. John is gone and Jacqui's voice struggles where before it soared. This is much more 'electric' in rendition....and I miss the 'folk'. I didn't do my research and didn't know there was a 'new' Pentangle. I'll be off searching for more of the old stuff, but this one won't be listened to much. Sigh...."
2,Doesn't anyone else see ???,"When I first started reading these books I became obsessed and thought they were the best thing since sliced bread, but the Fearless series has taken a disappointing turn. The new covers were supposed to show a change in Gaia's life, but all it shows is the author's lack of creativity. The new books are muddled and all they do is make more problems for Gaia, Sam, Ed, and Heather. There are no new situations and hardly any new characters. After Gaia and Sam hooked up, Gaia has nothing else to obsess and dream about. Also, the old Gaia we know and love is being replaced by a spacy and cheerful person. And what about Ed? Now he can walk again (which the author shouldn't have made happen because it was really cliche) he has lost his cynicism. It seems that everyone is misrable. In short, Francine Pascal has messed up a wonderful series and words cannot express how disappointed I am."
3,Too much Christianity,I would have preferred more focus on the main topic. He spent too much time relating later druids to early Christians.
4,"Useful, but maybe a tad overambitious","This collection of libertarian literature is a good first look at the wondrous world of anti-statist thought. It seems particularly apt for college students and other young people, yearning for meaningful ideas through the maze of collectivist propaganda.Nevertheless, it does have one sin: it is at once too broad and too narrow. Too broad because it covers too much ground and, at times, complex arguments are deprived of part of their explanatory power. Too narrow, because there are some significant omissions. In particular, I would have liked to see more examples of contemporary anarcho-capitalist theory (e.g., David Friedman).Notwithstanding that qualm, I found this volume extremely helpful."
4,Route 66,"From the Path is an uplifting book containing 66 poems and a bit of narrative on how to find your own path. While I have not yet completely finished the book, all the poems I did read spoke of an inner experience or reflection on life that I think most of us can relate to. Some are about seeing through life's stresses or challenges and others about its quiet times or moments of coincidence or serendipity. Almost all of them provide a sweet perspective and hint at a Divine influence. The author's meditative point of view is clear and can't help but bring a sparkle to just about everything he contemplates.I would recommend this book as a travelling companion. Whether one is moving along the path inward or outward these ""verses on the mystic journey"" provide a comfort and warmth rare in today's world. Enjoy."
5,gets to the right spots,This is a really good idea and very effective.Easy to use and adjustable in size to hit theright areas.
2,"Item broke, TWICE","I've purchased two of these for my girlfriend and each of them broke. She was doing nothing abnormal when using the product, just using it to rub her shoulders as pictured...and then SNAP!What's odd is the replacement for the first broke one was a bit of a different design...but in the end it didn't matter since it too snapped. When the thing stays together in one piece, it's effective. My girlfriend actually really liked it which is why we decided to get a second one when the first broke. But after two breaking within the first couple days of use, we won't be getting a third."
1,Useless,"I tried it on myself and my girlfriend who always have sore muscles on the shoulders and the back. This thing didn't really help loosen the knot or anything like that. The rod looks flimsy, could have be done much better."
1,Learn Swedelish in Two Easy Steps,"Step One: ""Fatherrrrrrrrr, she speaks to the deaadddddd.... but I can't understand what she's saying because I only speak Swedelish""Step Two: ""When darkness falls, I embrace my Anne Rice novels and cook a mean goulash in my gothic apron!"""
5,The Red Deck Rocks,"I love my red deck. I have a few other colored decks besides this one. Magical cards are cool, but none of them stack up to the red deck.I started my colored deck collection with the black deck, and knew other colors existed. This is one of the other colored decks I wanted.If you want to have some magical fun, or be the life of your next card party, or are simply a collector like me, get a deck of these cards."
3,Size is smaller than stated,"I just received this punch today. The size listed in the description said it was 2 inches diagonally. It's actually 1 3/4 inches. This is not ""super jumbo"" sized like other punches I've bought so don't be misled by the product name."
5,A beautiful book,"My 11 year old son, brought this home from the book fair at his school today. He was very proud to show me his purchase. We have already read it together with little brother 3 times now!Jason Cockcroft is an amazing illustrator. His pictures are beautiful and peaceful, while detailed.Room for a little one, is not long, but has such a beautiful message. It ends with ""...a Little One came for the world.""This book is perfect for a bedtime story, or to be read on Christmas Eve, or morning. Our family highly recommends this book. We would give it a 6 if we could. It will be within reach all year long, not just at Christmas time."
2,No payoff,"This book was great until it didn't show the baby jesus, after the entire book built up the birth! It just wasn't worth it."
5,Beautiful book,"I gave this to my son on Christmas Eve. It is such a beautiful, calming, touching book. The pictures are gorgeous."
5,Wonderful Christmas book - a fave we read yearround,"This book is so sweet - a light an peaceful story of the night Jesus was born, with a universal underlying message of acceptance and kindness that resonates with children regardless of religious affiliation. We love this book!"
5,Graciousness and Acceptance Good to Learn,"This is a simple story about accepting people into your group, even if they are different from you - told from the perspective of the animals in the stable at the Savior's birth. The concept is presented at the level of 2 and 3-yr-olds, but applies to all ages. Beautifully done. I gave it as a Christmas gift to children and adults both."
1,It's useless 2 keep on releasing the hits...,Reprint/remaster RJ's gr8 original album on CD!!!!!!!!!
3,"STARTS WELL, BUT FAILS IN SECOND HALF","In reading this book, one really gets a sense of how much safer ships are today than in the past. The first half includes accounts of disasters like the Titanic and the Birkenhead, which took many lives,(and left many widows). By the second half, very few are killed, despite horrific collisions,fires and oil spills. If the first shipwrecks leave many afraid of the sea, the latter ones are a terror only for insurance companies, who pay out good money to replace ships wrecked through incompetence and fraud.Edward's book presents twenty-four disasters at sea. Some are considerably more interesting than others. In short, I would say the book starts well, but fails in the second half, where the author focuses entirely on oil tanker accidents of the late twentieth century."
4,Very nice brush for the money,"I got this one for my first shaving brush and WOW!! I originally got the $22 dollar brush from Taylor of Bond Street. I quickly returned it for a $40 upgrade. I am glad I spent the extra money. Now, this may not be the finest silver tip brush on the market... but I may be hard pressed to find a better brush at this price. Also, the horn colored handle is very attractive."
4,Like having a cup of coffee with an old friend.,"When I was growing up Bobby Heenan was one of the premiere managers for the WWE. After a while he slowed his schedule down and became one of the best color guys with his best pair up being alongside Gorilla Monsoon. I was really looking forward to this book and it didn't disappoint as the day it came via UPS, I was cleaning the house, opened up the book to flip through and ended up reading it cover to cover in one sitting forgetting what I was in the middle of. While it wasn't at the Mick Foley standard, it was what a book should do, leave someone wanting more. Heenan tells funny stories about how he broke into the business and about the politics behind the scenes all with his dry wit many people have come to love over the years. This is a good light read."
4,great railroad watch,I purchased this watch to replace another like it damaged in an accident. The white face has a somewhat green tint which I find attractive in appearance. It does not glow very bright in the dark but I can still make out the time .Links can be removed from the good looking expansion wristband to allow a custom fit. I like an expansion wristband of this type which does not include a locking clasp.This is the best looking railroad approved watch I have found at this price level. The watch looks like it should cost twice its selling price.
5,Pulsar Watch men's PXNO21 watch,My husband loved it. and it was here on his Birthday. THANKS so much for your quick services. I love them.
4,Some good tools,"My daughter likes this product. She has thick, wavy hair. She can't use everything that is in the box but the things she can use she likes a lot. I would say that for the price it is ok to only find benefit from a few of the things. This product isn't as great as TV commercials make it out to be (but that isn't surprising). However, it has benefits and is cheap enough that we would definitely buy it again. If you think that 2 or 3 of the things would benefit you, then it is well worth giving it a try."
2,Not really very functional,I found that none of these 'doodads' created a look that I thought to be appealing. I would not order this again.
3,Not Total,"This is indeed a great toning video and does get your heartrate pumping. However, It does not include any Ab-toning exercise. I purchased the video based on the title ""Quick fix TOTAL boby toning"" but I was disappointed to find out that there was no exercise that focused on the Abs alone. Now I have to go through the headache of ejecting this video when its over, inserting another video into the vcr to get my Ab exercise and staying motivated at thesame time. So, if you're looking for an Ab-inclusive workout video, this is not it. It is great for other body parts though"
3,there are better and cheaper alternatives,"Like someone else said all you really need is the lint from your dryer filter. But if you want a packaged version of fast lighting tinder, Just go to your local store and buy a box of tampons. They are cheaper, get more bang for your buck, they are self contained and sealed, and they light up like a Christmas tree with just a few sparks."
4,Tinder-Quick,Great little product. Have used a few times (as a test) and these do what they are claimed to do. Now have in our 'emergency' bags. Would recommend
5,Thank you,"Thank you, Store-Who-Shipped-This-Product-Out, because you sent me 20 tinder-quiks for the price of 10 (that was un-expected, and I really appreciate it.) As far as the quality, I'm sure that this product will light afire very well, and I think that it looks like a good idea for my survival/camping equipment. I look forward to seeing these in action, and I'm sure that they will be well worth my money. By the way, the package arrived 4 days too early. Are you people gods or something? You kick the majorest of ""arse""."
3,They work,"These do not take a spark as quickly as I would hope but they do once you land a few on there. I got one damp and tried to light it and it went up fine after a few strikes. They also don't burn as hot as they should, and they burn out fairly quick, so make sure you have enough stuff within reach to take the flame or you'll be wasting them."
1,Not a three pack,"Although this item is described as a 3-pack, I only received one damper. Must say this made it a very expensive damper. Also, it would have been nice to have the three since the product is easily damaged during installation. It is very thin metal."
5,Attracting More Birds to Your Feeder(s),"In addition to very interesting and often unique summary information on different species of birds attracted to feeders, the book includes birdfood ratings and maps that are ideal for people who are trying to determine whether the foods, water, etc. that they offer for birds were found to be as attractive by other birdfeeders, and whether particular birds were attracted to feeders in their local rural, suburban, or urban area, or adjoining state. By examining various graphs, they can also tell: how many of each species typically come at one time; how frequently they may come between different periods watched by other birdfeeders; and whether there is any monthly variation in visits between November and April, when most people are feeding birds."
2,Not Up To Par With Other Bird Books,"I bought this book along with 4 other books about bird feeding on Amazon. In addition to these, I own dozens of other books about bird feeding, and bird identification. I have to say that of them all, this book is the worst of the lot. Its quite boring, and written more like a text book than something meant to be entertaining. And I found it relentlessly technical for just a backyard feeder like myself. It contains almost no illustrations, and also gets very bogged down in bird identification rather than the true nuts and bolts of bird feeding, seed choices....etc. Read some of my other reviews of bird books on here to make a better choice. There are much better written books for the back yard novice that isn't interested in gaining a PHD in bird identification."
5,a hot video!,Jodi Ann Paterson looks even better moving around on video than she does in her centerfold. She looks very seductive and hot in her video. Definitly worth the money.
2,"You'll Like ""The Incredible Mr. Don Knotts"" More","This book is simply Okay. I really hoped Don Knotts would go into more detail about his films. He only mentions his role in ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" merely once in passing. The photos are mostly duped over publicity shots fans have already seen. The cover is atrocious. I know that Don's publisher could have put out a better product for all of his fans.If you really want a great book about Don Knotts: See ""The Incredible Mr. Don Knotts"" by Stephen Cox and Kevin Marhanka. Now THAT's a fantastic book about the legendary comedian!!"
4,Perfect for the family,"This is a thoroughly well-crafted holiday movie, perfect for young kids -- but adults will have plenty of laughs. Wonderful cast and great music score. The child actors are especially good."
1,Horrible,"The first couple reviews must have been written by the same person because the movie is HORRIBLE!!! The acting sucks and its just an overall b-rated movie. Don't let the ""star"" of the movie fool you......Save your money and rent it if you really wish so see it. There's a reason why it didn't make it to theaters!!!!"
4,Not for large watches!,"For the money, this case is nice. The only thing I found out after my purchase is this case does not work well with larger watches. I have watches in the 50-52mm span that will not sit next to each other. If you are in the market for a nice case for smaller watches, this one is for you."
4,Good useful and durable cutting boards,These are great cutting boards that are very useful because of the multiple sizes. It's great to be able to just pull out the smallest size when I am only cutting some cheese or butter.Great in the dishwasher as advertised as well.
3,Good value but,"Loved the knife as it was easy to sharpen, had a continuous handle that gripped well and no parts to fall apart.Trouble with the 3.5"" is too small to make much of a cutting difference. I wouldn't even call this a paring knife, but a mini-cutter...which to me was so worthless that I went out and bought the 6"" chef's cutter Katana and LOVE that. Use it exclussively..now, wife swore she liked this 3.5 incher....and since I used it to cut open a box the other day: I think I 'accidently' threw it out with the box, she has stated she wants it back.so bottom like: guess it has some value for small items or persons with small hands who don't cut much...I'm the cook in the house.but, if you have a wife like mine: buy one."
5,Love Geography - Need help studying - Great book,My son started showing an interest in Geography in the 3rd grade so we bough t him a couple books & this was one of them!! He is now a walking text book! watch out!! He has won several Geography bees & this helped!! Plus he just loves reading the information & sponging up the information!! Enjoy!
4,"Song on Rush's ""Rush in Rio"" DVD from this CD","Rush used the song - ""Trilobita"" on the Rush in Rio DVD during the credits. It's a very nice percussive piece. I'm not totally sure what instruments are being played (I would guess Marimba or Balophone). It's very reminiscent of works that Neil Peart has written in the past (eg. Pieces of Eight, Momo's Dance Party, etc.) and fits in great with the Brazilian themed concert. Percussion fans should check this one out."
4,Good product,"I might not call it a miracle, but this product does a really good job detangling my girls' hair after bathtime and it smells awesome too. All of that, plus the fact that it is free of harmful chemicals make it a winning choice for me!"
5,Great product ! A Must have,"1./ Great quality.2./ Perfect ingredients (vegan), pleasant natural scent.3./ Great for frizzy hair (I have natural hair)4./ I do not have to use hair conditioner anymore."
1,Do the other reviewers work for the company?,I started using my own de-tangler on my two year old daughter and it worked great! I ordered this to get something safer for a toddler. My daughter has lots and lots of the curliest hair you ever saw. This stuff made her hair so horribly tangled she will probably never let me come near her with a comb again. Return!
1,no thanks,"I dont understand where all these rave reviews are coming from. I tried this on my daughters waist length wavy/curly hair and its sticky and does not do what it claims not to mention the smell-gross. It leaves a heavy coating on her hair and I cant get a brush through it. It smells like the eighties. Thats the only way I can describe it, like scents that were used in relaxer products in the 80's."
1,The only miracle is that they suckered me into paying this kind of money for it!,SOOOO dissapointed. This is super thick - like conditioner or lotion. It's feels gross in my girls thin hair. It doesn't work any better than anything else I have used...but at least for those I wasn't out $30! (I bought the bigger bottle...plus shipping).
3,"Check the prices on the other options, it may be cheaper.","THESE 2 DISCS ARE OFFERED IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. THE PRICES OF EACH OPTION KEEP CHANGING. CHECK THE OTHER OPTIONS TO SEE WHICH IS THE BEST VALUE AT THE TIME.This is sold 2 different ways:Lovers Live DVD with Lovers Rock CD in a DVD boxorLovers Rock CD with Lovers Live DVD in a standard CD jewel case.It is basically the same thing, except for the box. It is cheaper to buy it as a CD+DVD in the music section than to buy it as a DVD+CD in the DVD section.You can also buy them separately. If you don't want the CD or the DVD, it is slightly cheaper to buy them individually.There is also a CD version of Lovers Live, but it does not contain all the tracks.Go to those other options and you will see numerous reviews about the DVD and CD's."
4,i have been using it for over 10 years!!!,i can't go out w/o using this product on my hair. it smoothens the frizziness and makes it look normal.
4,Good stuff,This stuff is GREAT!!! Squeeze a little and work it into damp hair before blow drying or after. It makes your hair feel soft!!!
1,Did not like at all,"I have a total of 7 yoga DVDs and I also have sportskool on demand which includes yoga segments. They are all the power, warrior and extreme yogas, are very challenging, and I rotate through them doing yoga four to five days a week. The Fit Body Yoga is not good for me at all. It's extremely awkward with some strange movements throughout. I love moves that challenge my strength, stamina and balance, but the odd routines aren't that kind of a 'challenge.' She talks nonstop and most if it is not about instruction, direction or guidance, it's just chit chat, and the movement sequences are extremely awkward. I found myself bored and disinterested throughout. While there are a couple of moves that I like and can incorporate with my yoga, I will never use this DVD again. It was a waste of my money and not for me."
2,Not the best from Ms. Pillow,"I love the writer and had hoped that I found a new series to read but this one story stopped me from reading the rest. I never formed a liking for the female, she seems disjointed not well formed or maybe just cold and unfeeling. The loving was just so so and even the action was lacking something. I wanted to read about the other women but I found this installment of the series so boring I can't risk another bad read.Sorry,"
3,WARNING,"A few of the reviews listed refer to the 1995 Starrcade instead of the 1996 one. The world cup between U.S. and Japan happened at the 95 Starrcade, Piper-Hogan was at Starrcade 96, so make sure you are buying the one you want.P.S. Don't pay attention to the amount of stars I put, I haven't seen it."
2,Not a low EMF dryer.,"Contrary to what some people say, EMF hazards is not junk science. There are literally hundreds of peer reviewed scientific studies proving EMF risks. EMF can have a direct effect on Melatonin w/Ig panels which are very important for fighting cancer in our bodies.Anyway, this dryer is not low emf regardless of manufacturers claims, and therefore really shouldn't be considered for anyone concerned about EMF. (and we ALL should be concerned)"
1,One Of The Worst Jazz DVDs Imaginable,"First of all, look at the front cover of this DVD. My first impression by just looking at the front cover that Pat Metheny was going to be featured throughout the concert, but alas, he only appeared on two songs and two awful songs they were. Terrible, absolutely terrible. Second of all, who filmed this concert? A 17 year old high school kid? Totally unprofessional looking and lacking any kind of character. Lastly, the caliber of musicians who appeared on this film is truly disappointing. I mean these performances sound like college performers...in fact I've heard many college jazz musicians that sound better than these guys sounded.Don't waste your time or money on this DVD. The only way I would recommend this DVD is if you're a Metheny collector. Other than that, don't even bother with this one."
4,"Great cutting board, but a little small for rolling pizza","I initially purchased this as a pastry board for rolling pizza dough. It is a little small for that unless you are making personal-size pies. But the other side is a cutting board with a groove to catch juices, and it is ideal for that. So you get two-in-one, but the pastry board is rather small, unless you are just making small pastries.To oil: don't waste your money on brand name oils for boards, just go to drug store and pick up a bottle of mineral oil."
1,Product not as advertised,"Be careful, the product shown is the original retail box version of the game from Atari and Microsoft, but that is not what you get.What you get from the seller is a cheap reproduction, 2 sets of CDs, in cheap plastic CD cases with color photo copied covers.The product is from xplosiv.net, and not the original Microprose game or box."
4,Great Starter Machine that you can grow with,"I recently started sewing and wanted to get a machine that is simple to use yet has the capability to do more as my skills progress. This machine is a perfect fit for me. It is simple to use (thread, wind bobbins, load bobbin, sew different stiches, etc). I only ever used my Grandma's old Singer (from the 60's) and was worried that I might have trouble with those basics but this machine is so easy to use. It comes with many different feet and also a small storage compartment in the base of the machine. It is very easy to select different stiches (there is a small pull out stich map on the base of the machine) and alter the stitch length and width. I haven't experiment much with the zipper foot or button holes yet but am expecting it to go as smoothly as everything else has. I would recommend this machine."
3,Its O.K.,"If your looking for some great live footage get ""disasterpieces"". I went out and got ""welcome to our neighborhood"" the first day it went on the shelves. After i watched it i said to my self ""thats it?"". It is only 40 minutes long. One thing that yuo will not get anywhere else than this dvd is like a total of 5 minutes worth of interview with the band members. Again its an O.K. dvd but if u want an insane slipknot dvd go with disasterpieces. As for me ill will be waiting long and hard for the new and sadly last album."
1,big rip off,"I thought this would be like an inside the nine sort of thing but it is is just a Hight video with the Surfacing,Wait and bleed, and spit it out music videos. This also not 120 minutes like amazon said it was. The only positive thing about this dvd is deliverd in 4 days."
5,All you B*tches shut the hell up.,"This dvd is great, i am a very big slipknot fan and i also have the VHS version way b4 it even came out on DVD. I think its an awesome Vid it tells some stuff which is cool to know. I dont care what you all say you all suck. SlipKnoTs new DVD is coming soon"
2,Not much new here,"I suppose if you haven't read much in the psychology or self-help arena, this might be a good jumping off place, although Bruno does not have a list of recommended readings, which is irritating. But I found the book to be much too general, and to lack much original material. It is also quite repetitive, and a lot of it is just common sense.Instead of this book, I would recommend Existential Psychotherapy, by Irvin Yalom, Learned Optimism by Martin Seligman, or The Feeling Good Handbook, by David Burns."
3,Good... if you fit in a tiny little category,"This book is pretty decent at giving you a VERY basic education on blues rhythms but it's aimed at a rather small audience. This book is perfect if you've been playing guitar pretty informally for awhile and are looking to begin understanding the basics of a new style. If you are a new guitarist this book is probably a bit above you, if you've been playing for awhile and have gone through several other books... well, sadly this book is below you. I love the Musician's Institute books but this one falls way short. This is an introductory look into the style at best."
4,hypnotizing,"I don't know what to say about this CD. Bryers is one of the best modern composers, without a doubt. It's not like this is one of my favorite albums, either. But something has to be said about a looped track that you can listen to for 20+ minutes. I mean, I can't listen to Mariah Carey for more than three without getting queasy. Yet I can listen to some old guy singing the same thing over and over, and I can't bring myself to turn it off. Now THAT is musical genius."
2,Borrow it first,"Buy CDs that you expect you'll want to play reasonably often; otherwise borrow them, as I did with this one, from a library - - that'd be my advice. Borrow it again if you find you want to listen to it again.I don't think this is a religious piece; at least, to me it seems to be about experimentation (taken, as one reviewer put it, to the breaking point). It concludes with Mr. Waits sounding truly drunken.I made it through the entire CD in two sittings."
1,These discs are good for only one thing,These discs are good for only one thing..the container they come with...which is what I am giving the star. I have had many problems with these type of discs despite many efforts to protect them and store them properly. I do not recommend buying these unless you can't find a storage bin for your discs anywhere else or want to use the discs for coasters.
3,"New Direction, but still a great album","Though not everyone agrees with me, I found this album worth the money I spent. The title track alone is almost worth the money, and enjoyed the eerie tunes of Kill Your Pretty Face and My Tortured Eyes.Not a bad buy, but be prepared for something different."
1,Does not work!,This item doesn't do the job. It doesn't hold up anything. Before I even hook anything on it the hook falls down. Don't recommend it!
1,Complete crap,I followed the directions word for word and these hangers wouldn't hold up even the lightest picture frame.Complete garbage and a waste of money. Just use a nail and invest in some spackle and paint down the road.
4,A Great little product,I love these command hooks. I have so far bought two of these packages and have hung my KISS band records with them. Since I am a person who likes to rearrange my room a lot. My parents would hate it that I put new holes in my wall.So I bought a package of these and they are hardly noticeable. Please keep in mind there is a weight limit on each hook and this holds half a pound. But it is just enough for my records. It is a little difficult to get them off the wall with the strips. But still well worth it. I have only had one problem with the strip breaking in half when pulling it down so that's why this review gets a 4 star. But other than that it comes of clean and no residue or paint peel off and as my Dad would state it NO NEW HOLE on my wall.
5,Honest_Reviewer AWESOME HOOKS,"We live in an apartment so we were looking for something convenient and not permanent. We hang our keys on these hooks and its great. No problems. They are sturdy and hold well to the wall. The product stated ""mini hooks"" and they just are. You can hang your keys on them and I maybe a pot holder? Anyways, you get the picture. If I need more of these babies I will buy them but not here - I noticed they are in stores everywhere as well. And you can find them even for less with coupons, sales, no shipping, and such."
1,They don't work!!,"I bought these to hang up my light, thin calender in our newly painted kitchen. We followed the directions exactly- both times the calender fell off the wall. First time within a short period of time, the second time it made it over night and was on the floor in the morning. Never again will we buy these-"
2,"""Not Chuck's Best""","The actual music was fine, but this was more of an amatuer production and the video and audio was not up to high quality. In fairness, this was an older concert and maybe the tech was not available."
2,Rothchild is President of the Marty Zweig Fan Club?,"First, not much new here.Second, the first half seems to indicate that one should time the market to beat a bear, the second half seems to indicate that timing the market is futile.I didn't get much out of it. Nothing but examples. If you learn by case studies, this book might be of more value.Marty Zweig is mentioned in just about every chapter. Perhaps buying a book by Mr. Zweig would be of more value."
5,Good love making cd,"This cd will get things started and will last you until the end, just let it play. I'm searching for more like this cd."
5,Awsome Copier,"I bought this machine for its compact design and ability to do duplex printing. I have been very pleased with my purchase of the machine as well as the costs for maintenance materials and toner, very reasonable compared to other machines.The copy quaity is very good, it works great with the standard 20lb paper but work even better with 24lb paper. It's quick and quiet. I have only used the copier featuer of this machine since that is all I needed it for, so I cannot comment on it's other features. But if your looking for a good qualiy copier for a reasonable price this machine is for you."
3,Can't decipher error code - won't work,"I have owned this scale for nearly two years. I didn't start to use it diligently until about a year ago. I didn't use any of the features other than weighing my food in grams and ounces, so the next scale I purchase will be much more simple. I have no idea if the extra features work or are advantageous, but if you're looking for a simple measuring device, this scale may not be the best choice for you.I was forced to stop using it, however, after receiving error code OUt2. I have looked all over the manual trying to figure out what this error code means! The manual does not say. I've replaced the batteries twice to no avail. I'm frustrated that I'm going to have to replace this $40 scale already, and would have expected something like this to have lasted longer."
5,i absolutely,"love this DVD!..the ride back in time..the creativity..the easiness...the crazyness...the intro...yes..i love it...i love the way its presented..not perfect one on one...but just as perfect as ""yes we can""is a en vogue slogan that beats in erry available person who likes to change the world....cos we can!:)and this here experience helped changing mine and planted a big smile on my soulalways a fan !!-jada...( yes-my middle name-, came home in that old volvo;o)"
2,TigerDirect doesn't really sell this keyboard,"I, unfortunately, feel victim to the same problem as another reviewer. I ordered the PSR-175 but was sent the YPT-200 Karaoke keyboard, which hardly has the same features. Luckily for me, I was able to return it and received a full refund including the express shipping I paid. However, they promised me they would contact Amazon to have this listing removed, but two months later it's still here, baiting another poor soul."
5,Simply the Best,"Through all of the band's many changes this show puts the best foot forward. From the vocals being on key and not strained throughout all songs, to the more upbeat, quicker rhythm of Chris Slade's drums, this was AC/DC's finest moment as a rock band. All of their other videos do not come close. Check out the audience during the first song, Thunderstruck. It's a mass of people just jumping up and down in waves - definitely pulse popping. Awesome all the way through."
2,Shows it's age in a bad way.,"I picked up this concert DVD on a recommendation from a friend. I was interested to see this newly re-masteded concert, so I fired up my home theatre and gave this DVD a spin. I only made it half way through before turning it off, the sound was good, but there is no way that this was a live sound, my guess is that the sound was either re-recorded or re-dubbed and it left me with the impression that you were listening to a CD! and not a live concert. Second, the so called re-mastered picture was also a disappointment, there was too much grain and artifacts present that it gave the feel of watching an old film projected image from my days at high school! Overall, I was not impressed and this concert is only from 1991, so there is no reason why the film and sound quality should be this poor. I have seen many concerts on DVD that were either this age or older and they looked spectacular!"
2,Should be titled: AC/DC overdubbed w/ video from Donington,"The sound is obviously not from this concert, that makes it awful.I'd expect something like this from Britney, Madonna, Milli Vanilli, Ashlee Simpson, etc. I can even take the disclaimer on VH's DVD that says.. ""we recorded this over 2 different shows to get all the video"" and I can handle the Zep DVD where they did an AWESOME job considering that they had limited video to work with.Other reviews have said ""Disconcerting."" It is downright awful. The sad thing is that the audio is a good rendition of their work and the video makes it appear that it was one smokin' show, they are just not the same. RUSH in Rio was a show with low-quality audio, but you knew when Lifeson was playing, it was not some studioed-up version.The liner says ""One of the greatest live concert documents of all time."" This is only true if Winston Smith was doing the documentation of the concert. They had 26 cameras, but apparantly forgot to plug them into the microphones."
3,PAL not NTSC,"Amazon says NTSC, Disc & Package says PAL. This disc runs on my laptop but not my Toshiba DVD player. Beware of this before buying!!!If not for PAL format this would have gotten 5 stars!!!"
3,airframe stress,"Book is a solid reference, although many corrections need to be made. Been familiar with book for several years finally broke down and bought my own copy."
4,Good kids' book,"I loved this book when I was a kid. Good information abounds alongside interesting art. The life size images of claws and skulls really help you get a good idea of the scale of these animals, whether small (Velociraptor) or large (Utahraptor). It's a shame, though, that the illustrator lacked the foresight to restore the ""raptors"" with feathers, a mistake not easily forgivable in a book published after the description Sinosauropteryx."
1,give it a miss,bought this book along with five others ondinosaurs for my 7yr old son. his dinosaur crazyand didnt think much of this one.pictures are veryunreal and my son was not impressed..if your buying this for a child who likes to look atthe pictures because their level of reading is not yetgreat ..then dont..
3,Does the job but doesn't get deep without some hard pushing,"Its a fairly decent product. It does massage as advertised but it feels like in order to get a deep massage you have to push really hard on it. good, but not great."
3,Decent massager. Needs longer handle.,"I first ordered theProsepra Penguin MassagerIt's big, heavy, and cumbersome, and the one I received didn't work right. (You can read my review of the Penguin for more details.) So I sent it back and ordered the Wahl.The Wahl is smaller and thus lighter, so I thought it would be easier to use and more comfortable. But the things I thought were better about the Wahl turned out to be drawbacks... It's lighter but not as not as powerful. It's more compact, and thus not as cumbersome, but the handle isn't long enough to reach my back.For the price, I think this is a pretty decent little massager. I really like the heat option, but the metal heating disk has a sharp edge that scratches bare skin. (It doesn't get warm enough to feel it through clothing.) I wish the Wahl was a little more powerful and had a longer handle."
2,Quality Made - Lacks Power or Heat,"Being familiar with Wahl's reputation for quality and customer service I purchased the Wahl 4196-1001 massager after having several Homedics units over the years. Homedics no longer offers the heated unit I wanted hence I went with this unit. It arrived promptly and was obviously well made. It didn't even come close to the deep massage or heat output of any Homedics units I've had in the past. I returned the unit and was promptly refunded. I then purchased a Brookstone unit which, while lacking the heat feature, is an amazing VERY QUIET massager that really penetrates and is also well made. Granted...its not cheap...but what a massage...so I'll swallow the price. Also you can try it out in the store."
4,Nice Product--Takes a while to heat,"Pros:- Nice selection of attachments. With the variety I can't imagine there's anywhere on the body that couldn't be accommodated.- Heating option is nice to have.- Speed option is a nice transition. One for light massaging and the other for deep tissue.Cons:- Heating is only available with one of the attachments. This sort of makes sense but I think this is worthy of consideration.- Heating takes a while: When turning on the product with heat switch on, it takes several minutes to heat up, and after being adequately heated it gets too hot very quickly. There's a short window period where the heat is just right. A proper remedy for this is turning the heat off when the product is just hot enough, though still I think that this is worth pointing out.**Overall great product. I've had this product for three years, have used it several times with no defect, and it looks like I'll be able to use it for years to come. Would definitely recommend."
4,"Good, but...","My husband and I purchased this because we cannot give each other long back massages with our fingers and hoped this would help us increase the frequency of massages we could give. However if I could improve this then I would make it cordless, put the on and off buttons in a different spot other than the handle, and I would make the heated feature just a little hotter (I could not personally feel any heat other than the heat from the metal contact with my skin and heat caused by the friction of moving it around.) The machine itself is extremely sturdy, no rattling, or too much shaking that causes hand fatigue.I am not unhappy with this product.I will always believe you can trust anything with the Wahl name I am certain of that!"
3,great massager. Only prob is it scratches your skin with out protection!,"The head scratches your body especially when in the neck area, rough edges. I have to wear a t-shirt.Good heat."
4,Not bad for light massage,it is a good massager but for more light purposes. bummer you cant use heat for more attachments but its ok. i use it for some tendonitis and the heat is the best feature.
5,The most comfortable shoes I own,These shoes are great. They are shock absorbing and I can wear them comfortably through the airport right to the customer site and then out to dinner after that. They are the only shoes I pack for the entire week.
1,Good for 5-6 loads,"I bought one of these, worked OK up till the hammer broke off of the plunger on about my fifth reload or third time using it. It replaced my Porter cable that I had been using the last 10 years, I paid over $100.00 for it and well worth it compared to this $40.00 waste of time and material.I don't know where the brand name Wel-bilt ever come from, most likely from the people that are trying to sell it to you because they have to figure out a way to get rid of them. I did a search on the Web for the only number, name or anything that was on this gun (AF18/50)and found them for sale here and there but out of all those sites only one gave a clue who the manufacturer was, ""Powtech"", and a search on that name came up empty.To sum it up I am ashamed to have purchased this gun just as the manufacturer is ashamed to put their name on it."
5,Awesome Sween cream,"I purchased Sween cream from Allegro Medical. Their shipping and handling of my order was superb!!I have severe psoriasis that affects my legs, arms, and especially my hands and feet that it is so severe that it causes fissures (really deep cracks)and bleeding, making it very difficult for me to perform my duties as a home health nurse. I have spent thousands of dollars trying to find a cream, even using prescription medications to help this condition which is very painful. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, has helped any where near as much as this product. I highly recommend this to anyone with any dry skin problems. I really like the fact that it absorbs well and coats my hands & feet with protective covering yet doesn't leave my hands or feet feeling sticky."
5,Good stuff,"This is a really good product for chapped skin. I would recommend it to anyone for skin care. Nice aroma, also."
5,Love this item!,"This is about the third time I have purhased this product. It was recommended by the family doctor for a rash. It worked wonderfully and we have been using it every since. We keep finding new uses for it. I had a boil coming, applied this cream and the boil was gone in a matter of days. Love it and recommend it."
3,Not enough in the book,I liked the book but I thought there could have been more content. Arnold has done so much that and I thought the book could have said alot more about his life and his family.
1,Controversy for profit!,Save your money this one just try's to play off of Holy blood holy grail and the controversy over The Da Vinci Code. I hate to agree with other reviewers but this one was defiantly written for the money.
2,What Happened to Michael Baigent,"Baigent's Holy Blood book was an excellent book and a best seller. What happened in the intervening years to produce this book? Baigent must be short of money. I'm a lay person so I really can't comment on the depth of his scholarship, but even a lay person like me can see that Baigent is stretching the point.Of course it isn't all bad. In fact the book is well written and does seem to have some useful facts. But unless you are qualified to separate fact from fiction, the book can create a problem.I don't recommend this book to anyone, unless you already have sufficient knowledge to be able to benefit from whatever truth there is here and weed out the craziness."
2,"Holy Blood, Holy Grail is much better","Too bad I read Holy Blood, Holy Grail first because it is the benchmark for this author's works. This book is a rehash of the aforementioned. You'd be better off reading that one than this. The author reads his own work, which repeats itself so there is little meat in the text."
3,The Jesus Papers,The Jesus Papers is a necessary book. It exposes what needed to be exposed about ancient texts that have been found and get sat on for decades and centuries by those who know about them and keep them from the public.
2,Where's The Beef,The author spends too much time going through history and not enough time on his arguments. The final disc is the most interesting whereas the middle discs drag on.
2,Misleading and Circumstantial,"Very poorly written. Reading the summary at the end of the book eliminates the need to read the book. With atrocious sentence structure and pages of tangential information the author fails to substantiate the main premise of the book. At best, he introduces facts from which arguments can be made to raise valid questions about the life and death of Christ."
5,One of the Most Important Books in the Past 20 Years!,There I've said it! I intensely disagree with the negative reviews for this. This book is very well written and the author should be commended for having the guts to put forth ideas which should be obvious to everyone but (because of the manner in which we've all been brainwashed by organized religion) which most people seem too scared to entertain. The subtitle nails it: the greatest cover-up in history. We've been lied to for so long that we can't recognize the truth when it's staring us right in the face!
5,Catch students with mousetrap cars!,"A teacher can learn how to use mousetrap cars to teach fundamental physics concepts such as surface friction, fluid friction, Newton's Laws, rotational inertia, power output, wheels and axles, tension, torque, and center of mass. The chalk talks with Doc Fizzix are very insightful. I highly recommend this book for upper elementary, middle school, and high school teachers. This should be an essential part of every teacher's professional library!"
4,"There is no ""University of Indiana.""","This book is a very fine document. For us in Bloomington, it's good to see the front page of the Indiana Daily Student along all the other front pages from that dark day. Unfortunately, the book's editors committed a real gaffe by misidentifying the ""University of Indiana."" There is no such institution. The Indiana Daily Student is headquartered in Ernie Pyle Hall on the campus of Indiana University."
2,I like the pictures,"I like the pictures in this bbok but that is the only thing. I am probably the only one to say this but I am sick of this patriotism crap, it is used to sell products and make you believe this country is great. I think if we think that way our country is headed right for disaster. It was a sad day September 11th but if we let ourselves become snobbish looking to the world we WILL have the biggest downfall. Anyways...just watch the television you will hear enough about it and don't forget about the Pentagon and Pennsylvania."
3,A striking book that lacks enough international coverage.,"This is a book of headlines that followed the September 11th attacks. It is an excellent primary source and is in full colour which makes it a good teaching aid. My criticism of this book would be that it does not feature enough international newspapers. Ireland and Germany are not featured and both these nations have experienced terrorism before. Likewise there were no Japanese papers in this book, or Arab papers.As such it is most useful as an account of how the American press reacted to the tragedy with a few token international papers at the end."
3,not bad,"Its not bad considering it was made in 2002, a little simplistic but overall its not bad, if your looking for a real challenge then this is not the game. Graphics aren't to bad and the game moves a little slow, limited mobility, almost no exploration, your pretty much stuck following the story line and the trail on the map. But if your looking for a way to pass the time without getting to involved in a game then this is ideal."
3,THIS IS THE MOODY BLUES,"Gold, Anthology, Best Of, Greatest Hits, these are all ok collections of artists such as The Moody Blues. If you want something better, above the norm, unexpectedly greater than usual, then go get ""This Is The Moody Blues"" 2 CD set. This is the one to have from their first 7 albums. It is out of print for now, but it is worth searching for the above reasons. Each song fades into the next song, with great editing. This is a must have collection from the ""Moodies"". Go now (lol) and get this set ASAP."
3,Two main complaints,"Since most of my Moody Blues albums are on vinyl and I am currently without a turntable, I decided to buy this CD. One of the reasons that I still buy CDs as opposed to MP3 downloads is that I often enjoy the liner notes especially on a compilation album such as this. However, I found the liner notes here a real dissapointment. Michael Pinder was hardly mentioned and Patrick Moraz was not mentioned at all. I saw the Moodys live with Moraz and he was a great contributor to the group and was a major reason that ""Long Distance Voyager"" was such a hit. So if you are looking for good liner notes, look elsewhere. Also, be warned that the edit of ""Nights in White Satin"" is a travesty as has already been noted. It would have been better to have left this song off the album altogether. All in all though a pretty decent collection for new or casual fans of the group."
2,Why we fight video,Everything was Ok except the part suzqbooks of del mar Calif.One co. sent me the correct 7 volumes of WHY WE FIGHT but susqbooks sent me a set with only the first 3 volumes.Guess I will have to try to reorder from another company.Taylor Hendrickson
3,I think that's Felix da Housecat.,"D. Cole, that song you are describing sounds like ""Everyone Is Somone In LA"" by Felix da Housecat. It is on ""Devin Dazzle and the Neon Fever."" Check that out if you like the song-- it's a great album.The cover of this album is an interesting redo of the Clash's ""London Calling "" album cover."
1,EMO SUCKS!,Emo bands covering hardcore classics f**kn Senses Fail doing Suicidal Tendencies Institutioanlized? gimmiea break these guys demolished these songs dont buy under any circumstance unless the left side of your hair is covering your eyes and you wear tight jeans CLUELESS!
2,Coulda Been Amazing! How Low Can A Punk Get?,"This soundtrack suffers from extremes- they picked some great bands to cover (Bad Brains, Minor Threat, Misfits) and picked some decent modern groups to cover these songs (Thursday, Rise Against). But on the other hand, they chose some awful bands to over (TSOL??!!) and some even worse modern groups, again, to cover these songs (post-'Through Being Cool' Saves The Day, Taking Back Sunday, Senses Fail). Also, if you're going to go with emo and pop punk groups, why not pick AFI to do a Misfits cover? They did start out as a Misfits cover band... Hopefully, a kid or two follows up on some of the groups that inspired these covers and learns about how great they were/are, what it means to be 'straightedge', what a dogtown is, et al. Oh, and if this post makes you want to do that...do yourself a favor and don't chose TSOL to begin your journey into the discography of hardcore punk."
5,Excellent Deal for the Entry into Hi Def Video,"I just picked this unit up this weekend at a certain yellow tag retailer, because their deal was just too good to pass up. I got Heroes season 1 on HD-DVD, plus the pack-in of King Kong, plus the 5 extra movies (now with much better choices) all for $180! Basically, I got the player for free, along with over $100 of additional savings. If the HD side of the format war keep this up, they just might pull even with the BluRay camp. Not too mention they have some big name exclusives like Transformers this holiday season. Now I really want to upgrade my HDTV to a 1080p set with HDMI, because I hear the difference is amazing. In the meantime, the Stanley Kubrick catalog will be among my next purchases, as well as the long-awaited Blade Runner box set. If you were looking for a cheap but still great quality way to enter the next gen of hi def video, this is it!"
4,Great product for the price.,"I bought this for two reasons. First, I wanted to be able to watch HD DVD movies, but did not have enough inputs for a stand alone HD DVD player. Second, I got eight free movies with it. If you set an average price of $20 a movie, then it practically pays for itself. I would have given it five stars, but it does not support some of the lossless audio. Which at this point is not a big problem, since I don't have a receiver that supports them. If you have an Xbox 360 then this is a great addition to it."
5,"Not a game, its a Player.","This is a great way to get into the Next-Gen HD experience! An Xbox 360 is Required, to some this may be a turn off, however; check the prices of other HD players( Blu-ray or HD-Dvd) and it will be very comparable while also giving you flexibility and functionality. Inside comes with a remote and the movie King Kong( which is very good i gave it an 8.5/10). I bought this with the eight free HD-DVD offer, it was a no brainer to me, and fiscally it was expedient for me to get it before the Holidays! Plays both dvd and HD-DVD with upscaling of the latter( makes dvds look better on hd platforms). shipping was excellent and packed well! no complaints about the service or product. hope this helps others looking to get in to HD experince for about $500(xbox 360 and Hd-Dvd player). Good Luck!"
5,Don't believe everything you read!,I did not buy this from Amazon but I have the ability to write a review anyway. This product is awesome and works just as intended. It worked for the other 9 co-workers who bought it as well. The reason I'm writing this is for those who read these reviews to be skeptical of those who rate it 1 star and trash the product. They may be Blu-ray fans who are trying to get their 2 cents in there. The product is great and it will be used until it dies...
2,"Loud and Hot, and not in a good way.","I bought this product because at the time it was less than a stand-alone HDDVD player. Installation was easy, and it comes with remote. It plays HDDVDs well, and with good picture quality. The sound quality is probably good too, however with the noise that this little unit, and the XBOX makes it becomes distracting. This is further augmented by the increased heat in my entertainment system, which makes the heat fans in all my other components run faster. If I were to buy a HDDVD player again, I would by a stand-alone component. They have come down in price and are now comparable to the XBOX solution."
5,XBOX 360 HD DVD Player,"Great Deal, great product, HD DVD player for under $200 plus it plugs right into my XBOX 360, and is a small compact unit. I also received 7 free HD DVD movies with the purchase which made the deal that much more sweet. I highly recommend this add on to anyone with an XBOX 360 and an HDTV."
1,Obsolete. Toshiba to dump HD-DVD,"As of today, February 17, 2008, all news report indicate Toshiba is dumping HD-DVD. So don't buy this, the writing is on the wall: Blu-Ray has won. If you want HD movies, try a standalone Blu-Ray player, but everyone knows the best price/features ratio is given by the Playstation 3."
5,Incredible value - get'em while you can!,"Even if you don't watch HD-DVD, and at this point don't want to invest in a collection of obsolete plastic and foil, get this drive! You can plug it into any PC, Mac, or Linux box for a great external USB DVD drive (this has saved me hours of tech support). You can also, over course, watch HDDVD's if you have the right software, but you'll not find such a handy drive at such a price any time soon. (hope they do one for blu ray too)."
