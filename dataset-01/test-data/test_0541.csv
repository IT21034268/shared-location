1,A Taste of Good life Book Not Good,"This book, although has a few good recipes, is written for this woman and not for all IC sufferers..She seems to contridict herself alot..I found this book confusing because she added other diseases in with it..Not worth my money"
5,First-Rate Totally Entertaining Stuff!,The Acoustix make you want to sing along with every song they sing. This CD is among the best I've ever heard and I think they should record more just like this one!
3,It's Ok,"I bought this ""expensive"" program before coming to China to live. It's ok, but I would not refer it to anyone due to the cost and what you actually get with it. The Chinese have great products for learning English, too bad we don't anything as worthy for learning Mandarin."
3,alright,It was an easy to work with program but I wouldn't say it was as effective as they promote but than again maybe i was just to lazy.
3,Great product if you already have some familarity,The Rosetta Stone software is very good but it has some drawbacks. For a native English speaking person they work great for European languages that have a lot in common with English. But for someone with no knowledge of Mandarin at all they are no where near as effective (bordering on perhaps worthless?).Overall I would highly recommend the Rosetta Stone software even though it's a bit over priced and certainly insufficient as your primary learning method. Rosetta Stone *combined* with Pimsleur is a great method for languages not far from your native language. Also the disks are copy protected and that is a serious drawback as you need the CD in the drive any time you are going to use it and you can't use a backup copy for safety.
5,Rosetta Stone Chinese,This product has given me the knowledge of Chinese I have been unable to get in any other venue. In two weeks I can read hundreds of sentences and my vocabulary is much stronger.
3,False Advertising,"I take issue with Fairfield Language Technologies' claim that the Peace Corps and State Department uses this computer program.I just completed the State Department Chinese language course and I never saw any teacher nor student use this program. Perhaps it is used with other languages that were taught at the Foreign Service Instutute, but not Chinese.As a former Peace Corps trainer, I find it hard to believe that Peace Corps trainees would use this program. Trainees spend at least four hours a day in language class and then spend their evenings staying with host families. The idea is to get out and interact with people, not with a computer."
1,No good for sub-woofer,"I purchased this to connect a sub-woofer wirelessly to a A/V receiver. There was an article on the Buttkicker site indicating this would work. However, it did not work at all. I contacted Buttkicker directly & talked with their technicians and they indicated it should not be used for that purpose. Therefore, I returned the item."
1,1 star because it turned on.,I also used this to connect a subwoofer and it transmitted signal but had a loud feedback hum when playing music or when not. Also reciever and transmitter have to have a clear line of sight to operate correctly. If you need to run a sub to the other side of the room run wires.
1,Retractable cord broke after 2 months!,"The hairdryer works just fine. I've used a Conair product for years before it finally died and this is the replacement model I purchased mid December of 2007. Just as other users have noted, be very careful of the retractable cord as it does go WAY too fast and has a tendency to sock you in the face or hand as it flies in. But worse yet, the retractable cord broke after only 2 months of use. Now it is permanently retracted and I can't seem to unjam it. That means I can't pull the power cord out and therefore can't use the dryer. What a piece of junk! Of course the 2 year warranty asks you to mail this heavy sucker back and then pay $5 to cover shipping back to you. Meanwhile, the hairdryer is only $20... you do the math. Another fault is that the lettering on the dryer (high, low, hot, cool, etc) rubs off within days. Not a big deal, but another cheap factor. I'd still buy Conair, just not the retractable cord version."
3,Good but not perfect,"The results the hairdryer produces are great. The retractable cord is not. Mine broke after the fist use. Now I can't get the cord to ""lock"" into place when I pull it out, and the retract button is temperamental - doesn't work when I need it to or goes off suddenly on its own. Also, be very careful when you use the retract button; the heavy plug at the end is dangerous."
2,MISLEADING warranty!!! Consider it a disposable purchase! Mine is in the trash!,"I bought this dryer for $20 and was pleased with the performance, especially the retractable cord feature. However, about a year after owning it, it shorted out near the bottom and was working inconsistently. I had my original receipt and it was warrantied for 2 years, so I contacted Conair. The customer rep said I had to pay the shipping to them, (insured,) and write a check to them for the shipping back to me. I could have gotten a new hairdryer for the cost of their so-called warranty. I went and purchased a Revlon hairdryer and will never buy from this company again. So, if you are thinking they will replace a faulty product for free, THINK AGAIN!"
2,Cord retractor broke after 2 months,"The dryer works well, but the cord retractor no longer works after 2 months. I'm no longer able to lock the cord once it's pulled out, so this hair dryer isn't usable. I'm now buying a new one that doesn't have a cord keeper."
1,Warm is warmer than hot!,"I bought this hairdryer because my last Conair had finally conked out after about 15 years. I took it out of the box to test it, plugged it in, turned it on and almost immediately decided to return it. I liked to use the hot setting on my old dryer, so I kicked the temperature setting up to hot on this one and was stunned to find that the warm setting is actually hotter than the hot setting. The hot setting was barely warmer than the cool setting. Something is seriously wrong with that.Also, the cord was very difficult to retract. I can understand why so many people say that the cord keeper function stopped working after a very short time. This convinced me that even though a retracting cord may be convenient, it is more trouble than it is worth."
4,Conair Hair Dryer with Cord Keeper,This hair dryer works well. The various settings dry soaked hair as well as damp hair. The price was right. The cord-keeper is a practical aspect...no more wrapping the cord around the dryer.
1,Wouldn't waste my money,"My professional grade hair dryer died, so I just picked up a dryer from a local retail store. This was the best dryer they had available for sale. I wish I had kept the box so I could return it! This dryer is horrible. It is extremely heavy and has a super short cord. With my old dryer, I was able to dry and style my long, thick hair in about 15 minutes. With this dryer it takes over 35! It leaves my hair feeling dry and crunchy. Also, I'm not able to style it as well with a brush while drying, so I have to spend extra time styling with a flat iron. I would suggest that you spend a little more to get a better quality dryer. I think this would only be good for men, or women with super short hair."
1,"Cheap cord, broke in 5 months, fire hazard","The hair dryer design itself is good, but the material the cord is made out of is cheap. After 5 months of daily use, it lost its connection within the wiring, near the end of the plug. Since it's more than 60 days, I can't return it to the store. And since it costs me money to ship it back to Conair, AND I have to include another $5.00 for their shipping an new on back to me, I think I'll just toss it in the trash. I will not waste my time or more money on Conair."
3,Not that great,The watch doesn't keep good time. Maybe Seiko isn't that good of a watch anymore. I expected more from them.
1,horrible service at amazon.com got the wrong item!!!,Oh my goodness. I cannot tell you how horrible my service was from amazon.com. I would totally order this item but from a reliable place like target.com or somewhere else that sells it. I received the wrong item and amazon.com would do nothing about it. Their answer to the problem was for me to rebuy the item at another 34.00 charge afte I already was charged on my card for 34.00 and never received the item (I got some pain gel). I then was told I could get a refund but funds would not be available for 3 business days. This means I would be out 34.00 for 3 days and they did nothing else to compensate me. Horrible customer service if you don't get the right item. Not to mention that I was hung up 3 times and on the phone for 2 hours to get a refund when I didn't even get my item!! I still cannot believe it....will never order from here again!!!
4,Easy to use; No damage to railing,"We love this kit. We have used it on two staircases. We purchased it for one and were so pleased we bought a second one for upstairs. It is easy to assemble, although YOU WILL NEED A DRILL. The good thing is you drill into the kit, not the banister. The kit essentially allows you to mount a flat piece of wood parallel to your banister. You can then attach whatever gate you want to the flat wood, leaving the banister untouched. Two clamps seal around your banister so that you never drill into it. I am no expert handyman and it took me about 45 minutes to assemble, with most of that time spent reading the instructions and checking ten times before I drilled anything. One downside: the instructions could be better. I was able to figure out what to do (it's sort of obvious from looking at the parts), but the company would do well to improve on the instruction writing. This was not a deal breaker for me, though."
3,On the Fence,"Well firstly we have a stairway that has round posts all the way to the floor. So we need to order another piece to make it work. No where in the descriptions does it say there is only one round post adaptor, I just says ""use the round post adapter for round posts"". LAME. Secondly it has the worst instructions ever. So terrible. The pictures are terrible. It does not tell you what tools you need. The screws are poor quality and too long. For all the people who say it needs washers... it comes with washers. It also does not seem so safe if the posts are tapered in any way. It is very difficult to install if you only have 2 hands... Oh wait. And lastly this product is really expensive!!!! But it would appear that there is nothing else in the world that does the same thing."
2,A bit dissapointing,I was a little bit sketchy about buying this dvd as there were no reviews on it... i am a HUGE chilis fan absoultly love them to bits but this dvd was a bitc dissapointing. Has some old footage of the band which i haven't seen before but it is basically a short film about how the band formed and who has been part of it over the years. And i recommend to anyone that has read Scar tissue that they don't buy the dvd because in my opinon Anthony gave a more in depth discussion on the band over the years and i got more out of reading the book which is a fantastic read for any chilis fans!! Also on the back of the dvd/book cover it says it has in depth interviews with the band... The footage has absolutly no interviews with any band member whatsoever!! Probably the only thing i liked was the book that had an analysis of each song they've ever recorded minus the stadium arcadium album.
2,"Clunky, heavy, reasonably powerful.","I'm in agreement with the others who are unhappy with this unit. It's heavy, the strap is inadequate, and the amount of hand power required to depress the trigger and safety is ridiculous. After 15 minutes of use, I can barely manage 30 seconds of on time (male, 36 years old, no degenerative skeletal or muscular problems.) The line does break frequently. It won't take down weeds with stems bigger than pencils. Since I own it already and my yard is small I'll probably disable the trigger safety and rewind the core with heavier line, warrantee be damned. Would not buy again, would not recommend."
4,Good in General but could have been better.,"Pro.1) Electric, no stinkin gas spell to deal with.2) Trim very nicely.3) Batt. life is long enough.Con.1) Heavy. What a work out.2) Line is too weak and thin. Neight I have strong grass but something eats the line. Like 10min or so of cut, I have to extend the line again.3) Not good for tall ppl. Since the length is fixed, tall people have to bend a little.4) Safety trigger is a little too hard. Have to constently pressing hard on the trigger to keep it going.Over all I rate this a ""B""."
1,I Would Not Buy This DVD,"I wouldnt By This DVD Because I Hate Danny Phantom Hate All Growed Up I Hate My Life As teenage Robot. I Hate Every Cartoon On This Movie Now I would Buy It If It Had Old Nick Shows Like AAAhh!!! Real Monsters,CatDog,The Angry Beavers,The Brothers Garcia,Rockos Modern Life,invader Zim,Hey Arnold,The wild Thornberrys,Rocket Power,And Rugrats. SpongeBob Square Pants Is Taking Over Nickelodean. Sponge Bob Is The One That Got All Of Those Shows I Just Listed, Canceled... So Thats Why I Hate SpongeBob.So They Need To Take Sponge Bob Off The Air Before They Cancel every Good show That They Have Left. CatDog Was My All time Favorite Show.So Listen Up Nickelodean SpongeBob Is Bad News So Start Making All Of Those Shows I Just Listed again!!!"
3,Interesting and funny read,"Skipper's Revenge is thought-provoking satire. Although it can be certainly be enjoyed as light, fun, reading by the pool, if the reader looks deeper, Teahan is makes some interesting points about society's views of women and the roles of women and importance of beauty. This would make a perfect read for a book club."
1,Worthless.,"The first commentator is right. This book doesn't address the issue of cleaning your Vista OS. This book is pretty much good-for-nothing. I usually don't review books, but this one is one of those exceptions, don't waste your time people."
2,Where are these great reviews coming from?,I did not have a good experience with this product. The blades broke after a month of light use and the bag was VERY difficult to install and remove from the unit. Stay away!
3,"Powerful, but not without problems","Does a great job of blowing and vacuuming. The metal impeller blades are a definite plus (and the reason I bought it).The only problem I have with it is that at least half of the time, when I turn the speed adjuster knob to 'Off', the blower/vac doesn't turn off. I have to wiggle the switch or just unplug it. I'm going to need to get it serviced, but I don't regret the purchase."
3,"Great blowing, broken vacuum","The blower works great; the vacuum was working well for two days, but then the filter on the bag collar tore. I could not find a replacement at Amazon or at Home Depot. I have contacted Toro, but have not had time to get an answer yet."
2,Works great for a while,"This is my 3rd toro blower. My first one lasted about 3 years. The second one, a year and a half. This one burned up in less than 6 months, using it less than once a week. Great while they work... There is one design flaw in terms of sucking things up: the ""scoop""is a two piece scoop and it is designed so where the two pieces go together it makes a nice lip for stuff to snag on and get stuck."
2,It WAS a nice blower until...,"I purchased the Toro 51598 a few years ago and it worked great. Powerful, and the vacuum/bag did the job with my leaves.Unfortunately, with Fall here and leaves starting to fall, I began to use it again; it started to smoke, and then eventually died.Like other reviewers, this Toro blower has at most 2-3 seasons of life before it ends up in the trash.Jim"
4,Gets the job done,"We've used the device entirely in Vac mode to clean up the driveway and patio. It totally works as advertised, sucking up leaves, crushing them and putting them in the bag.You might find the unit a bit unwieldy to manage because of the bag, but I definitely would recommend it as a leaf vac. I was concerned that I needed a gas unit because an electric would not be up to snuff and I was wrong."
3,"Good blower, so-so vac","I bought this mainly for the vac feature to suck up leaves. It works well for dry small to medium size leaves. If the leaves are damp or large, it does not work as well. Sometimes gets jammed with small twigs etc that find their way in. Mulching feature works well and does reduce the volume of the leaves. It's loud, make sure to wear ear protection."
5,"Powerful, well designed blower","I have used electric blowers for years and this is the most powerful one I have owned. I especially appreciate the variable speed control. I saw no use for it until I had to blow a few leaves from an area surrounded by mulch. The slower speed allowed me to do that without disturbing the mulch. I haven't used the vacuum yet, so no comment on that. My pants are occasionally sucked to the air intake but, other than that, the blower's design is perfect. I strongly recommend the purchase of this blower."
3,Better than a tissue,Not for use with heavy active bleed. Worked okay for small light bleed. Will use again. Not enough packages for a regular bleeder
3,Good but far from very good,"The product is good for very minor nose bleeds: for more than that one needs a far better product. Also, for what it is is quite expensive. A tiny piece of emostatic cotton, that's all. If someone knows of a stronger one please let me know."
1,This product is a scam.,"Yes, this product is a scam. It is no better than a cotton ball, because the fiber is very harsh. There is no medicine to stop the bleeding. A month later when you have a nose bleed and find out the scam, it is too late to return the product. So do not buy it. Amazon should take this product out of its site."
4,well,"this *certainly* works. my problem is that is reminds me of fiberglass insulation, and it tickles-- sometimes I end up sneezing."
3,"This is a very unusual cd, buy it and you will see why......","This cd is a little different from most. Let me explain! This cd has a great mixture of several types of music. This cd features popular, classical, sacred, and wedding music. What a treat it is to have all these beautuful songs together on one cd.The main concern I have for this cd is the fact that some of the arrangements were not up to par. As you will see, all songs are not ideal for harp arrangements. I liked about half of the songs performed on this cd. I feel like the song selection could have been a little bit better. If that had happened, I think this would have been an outstanding cd.I Would Like To Recommend This Cd"
5,Awsome Book,"There have been many books written on narcissim. With this problem so rampant in my family and seeing it at work, I now understand it much better, thanks to this book, and I now can at least identify it quicker and protect myself .This to me was a wonderful gift to understanding this disease!"
5,I am the mother of one,"I love my son with all my heart and it is just breaking because I can't go back into time and fix him. This describes him so well and it hurts. He is my only child, I am a single mother and this realization is devastating. He's still young, (20) I'm wondering what did I do? Or not do? You can divorce a husband and move on, but what about parents? All the counseling in the world apparently can't fix this, the word to potential partners is ""run don't walk"" to the nearest exit, how do parents cope? it is so hopeless."
3,Malignant self love,Scary to finally realise what sort of person you were involved with. It explains it in a dark manner that surfaces all your deepest fears about someone you thought you loved.
5,Simply the BEST book on Al Davis!,"Well-researched, well-written, and fun to read, this book reveals the ""Genius"" in all his wretched squalor and details the steps he took to get where he is. Great sport!"
1,Metamorphosis Blu-ray,Just another intelligent design propaganda video cloaked to appear as science. It is a shame these people go to so much effort to produce something that only preaches to the choir.
5,This is an inspiring movie to watch,"I have to be honest I knew very little about butterflies before seeing this movie, and I didn't expect to be wowed by watching it. We'll I was very wrong. This has been a life changing moving for me and my family. This is a very tangible way of seeing God's work first hand. I have shard this movie with our friends and they are equally impressed with the movie. This should be shown to all kid's in school, regardless of the strong reference to God. We need more tools to get our children interested in the sciences. I plan on buying extra movies to give away as gifts. This is truly an amazing story about an amazing insect."
4,Must Read to Understand Aikido,"For me, this book is very helpful in helping me deal with my everyday conflict in the 'aikido way'. As an Aikido student, almost all the physical techniques I learn in class are mostly suitable for physical `attacks'. This book has `enlightened' me on how to handle non-physical `attacks' (communication, social confrontation, problem handling, etc). Complete understanding of both makes us realized that the aikido concept is almost complete for physical and non-physical `attacks' we face everyday."
5,Life changing,I picked up a copy of this book at a local yard sale thinking it would be filled with Aikido techniques . I got more than I bargained for and still can't figure out why anyone would even let go of it once they had read it. It has changed my life. Dobson/Miller put the idea of conflict and how to deal with it into its proper perspective. The techniques are not only informative but extremely practical. I began to use the philosphy of blending with attack immediatly. The results are that I am able to difuse angry situations quickly and build meaningful relationships with those around me. The explanations are clear and concise. I have since embarked on Aikikai Aikido Training. Thank you Dobson/Miller for your gift
4,Well made fiction.,"This book has turned out well for everyone. The individuals profiled get to look like geniuses, just because for5 years luck was in their favour. And this is Jack Schwager's criteria for inclusion in 'The New Market Wizards'.None of the individuals profiled in this book are nonexistent, however absolutely none of them has met Schwager.They do not sue because they are considered American folk heroes, and they get money; in some cases a hundredmillion dollars to invest.Jack Schwager is a well connected man, and he has made a relatively good life for himself, through his Castaneda-esquebooks, which open some doors for him in this jaded world of finance.LEGAL PROOF: Just call three random individuals profiled in this book, and ask them if they have met Schwager, orgiven him an interview whether through phone, email, or letter."
5,"I'm a broker... I bought it... you should, too!","If you don't want to spend twenty years and untold sums learning about trading by doing it yourself, learn from the experts in the time it takes to read this book. A great companion to Schwager's FUTURES series, all three should be in any trader's or wanna be trader's library. THE NEW MARKET WIZARDS has what it advertises... market wisdom."
5,Excellent performance,"I bought a spare battery for my Zen Vision W as I take a lot of long haul flights and power points are not readily available. Battery life is excellent easily giving 4 to 5 hours when watching films and well over 16 hours when listening to music. Also charge is retained really well, I inserted a battery that had been charged 10 days previously to find it was still fully charged."
1,Didn't get it right,I purchased an extra battery for my Zen Vision/W 30GB player. They sent me a battery for a Zen Vision and not the Zen Vision/W they sent me another one and it was still the same older version. I have yet to receive a refund as of 2 Sep 08.
4,William Gibson Meets John Le Carre,"An eco terrorist group sets up an orphan who has fallen in with them. High tech, nano tech, and government agents abound in this wild, thought provoking story (how would you like to start life all over again?). Like Gibson and Le Carre, at times it is hard to understand what is going on. Go back and re read, it's worth it."
3,Not was I thought it would be,"I was looking for a film more about Assata. I like indies more than most, but the romance should have been left out. I'm sorry, but I can't recommend this one."
3,Why no shuffle between discs capability??,"I went through the trouble of hooking up the Sony DAVDX255 and was enjoying the unit until the moment I tried to randomly shuffle between the five CDs I had loaded in the machine. This unit does not allow such random shuffling!! I was befuddled. This is a capability that manufacturers were building into multiple CD players 15 years ago -- Sony decides they no longer want to provide that to the customer? Upon further investigation, I discovered that very few of these new ""home theaters"" are providing the shuffle between discs capability in their machines. I returned the Sony disappointed. I ended up buying a JVC from Amazon that preserves the shuffle capability between discs, but I had to also buy a receiver to plug it into, as the all-in-one systems don't provide the shuffle feature. I've never heard of such an idiot move like this one -- removing a perfectly popular feature like random shuffle from all future machines. Stupid stupid stupid."
2,not an album,"bought this in november... love the song ""feels so good"", but i wanted to check out the rest of the songs/tracks as indicated per the ad ...all i got was a single cd w/ the same song mixed by diff mixers ...what the?"
5,The choir is superb,"This CD is a Nebraska product, and a fine one it is! The director of the choir, Almeda Berkey, has combined with her husband, composer and professional pianist, Jackson, to produce this nostalgic look at the wonderful arrangements of their former mentor and employer, Norman Luboff. The liner notes in the accompanying booklet tell of the surprising association of Omaha's Chip Davis as a singer in the Luboff choir, along with Almeda. The choir is superb, well balanced, displaying beautiful voices and a thoroughly professional sound equal to that any of the Luboff choirs on the twelve LPs this author owns...Good variety in programming is a plus, as folk songs, pop songs, folk hymns and spirituals are all presented. Congratulations to the Berkeys, Recording Engineer Clete Baker and all involved on a first-rate recording!"""
1,Be careful...it may make the problem worse!,Our baby cried non-stop for hours...usually in the evenings. This was recommended by our paediatrician so we thought it was worth a shot. We gave her the recommended amount and we had the worst night EVER! 10 times worse than her regular crying. We now know that she has acid reflux so this product made her reflux worse! We now have a prescription for pepcid and she's the happiest baby in the world!
4,Rosetta Stone,Easy to use. Easy to understand. The method of instruction really is better than the others.
4,Not so traslucid,"Its a nice watch but it has a few cons: 1. white traslucid material is a bit yellowish (not like the picture) -the seller explain me that is a normal fact. 2. The band material isn't leather, and if is leather, it has an ""amazing synthetic look"".Forgetting these details this is a great watch."
5,Tired of looking through a little peep hole?,"This is an amazing device. You do not have to walk up to and put you eye to this peep hole to see who is on the other side of the door. In a matter of fact you can stand half way across the room and see all you need to. Great idea, good looking and functions the way is was designed to... Love it."
2,Screw Loose,"Be careful. The screws on the bottom eventually come loose and gouge your work. Other than that, it works very nicely."
5,beautiful,Wonderful artwork.Wonderful story. I actually enjoyed Rock Gaiden more than the featured story but....I do enjoy tragedy with my smut.
2,What a piece of wishy-washy garbage.,"I picked up this book at the local libarary, thinking it would be a scholarly analysis of the scriptures. When Mitchell claimed that he had done ""research"" and discovered which parts of the New Testament were added and which might really be attributable to christ, I thought he would present more evidence than ""Anyone can tell Jesus wouldn't have said THAT!"" ...If you want to read feel-good, new-agey ramblings about Jesus, this is the book for you. If, like me, you were looking for a book that provides an in-depth, well thought out, well-researched, scholarly investigation of the nature of the original jesus, go elsewhere, without a doubt.The only explanation I can see here is that this book is listed for ""young adults."" I can only hope this is why Mitchell dumbed the book down so much - because otherwise he's not a very good writer on top of everything else!"
2,Wyeth Estate should sue,"Just a guess here: Writer's block dealt with by taking Andrew Wyeth's story and changing the names and adding a few fictitious characters to pad things. I was not able to care for these characters in any way; I couldn't feel any sympathy for them or identify with them. This was for a book club, and I came away feeling like I'd wasted a couple of hours. You know how it is, you buy a book and you know it's not going to get any better, but you think you just have to finish what you've started. That's a bad habit, like not walking out on a bad movie. Why am I reviewing it after all this time? I cleaned out a closet, found the book and gave it to my auntie. She reads bodice rippers, and loved it! She didn't know who the heck Helga was, so not a problem."
1,It Came Broken,"I do like this wine rack for a very specific space I had in mind; however, it came broken and I returned it. I also checked and the spaces are not wide enough to hold half of the champagne bottles I have. So I returned it because it was broken, but I won't reorder. Also I would say to be careful to fill from the bottom, as it can be tippy I am told by someone who has it."
2,OK,"It is serving my purpose. I found it frustrating to assemble because the holes don'tn align, and you have to finesse the frame connectors to align with the holes. I called Customer Service to see if they had any hints, and they did't."
1,Pieace of crap!,"This was a piece of crap, flimsy aluminum construcion, couple of screws were broke right off when trying to put it together, we threw it right back in the box and are gonna ship it back. If it managed to stay together I dont think it would hold half the bottles if can....I would NOT buy!!!"
2,Acupuncture energetics,"The book is based on finding the answers in two other books (I didn't find that out until I bought it)The re-shelving cost was as much as the book, so I kept it.So, not usable as a teaching / learning tool unless you have the other two books but one is out of print and the other has revised and so the ""refer to"" pages are not there."
5,Easy read. Great advice. Key insights.,"Carmine Gallo's multiple years of experience clearly shows itself throughout this book. Not only does he give many credible examples throughout, but also he provides many key pointers that anyone wanting to improve themselves in any type of communication can really benefit themselves.I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone wiling to learn from some great communicators, take the time to fully understand Carmine's thought processes, and truly wants to become a better communicator."
3,Moods...Moments,"Monifah's first CD is enjoyable. It contains more songs that you will like than dislike I think. ""I Miss You (Come Back Home)"" was a single and definitely one of my favorites on the album. There is also a remix to it at the tail end of the album and the beat was used again for a TLC song off of their discFanmailentitled, ""I'm Good At Being Bad"". Another slew of favorites are the sexy ""You"", ""You Should Have Told Me"", ""Lay With Me"" and to a lesser extent ""You Don't Have To Love Me"". The thing that keeps this from being a 4 or 5 star affair has nothing to do with Monifah who has an underrated voice. It's more the material chosen for her to sing which occasionally falls flat.3.5 stars."
2,"Good at first, horrible over time","I purchased the 25RS100 television because I'd had good luck with Sharp in the past, I liked the relative simplicity of this TV, and the price was very reasonable. It worked great for about a month. Then it started making a buzzing noise whenever it was plugged in for more than an hour or so, even if the TV was not turned on. I exchanged it for a new TV of the same model. I've had the second TV for about four months, and now one of the speakers is making a strange noise. I give it two stars instead of one only because I've had good luck with Sharp in the past. As for this particular model, I've had two of them with flaws within a few months of purchase. I wish I'd looked elsewhere after the first one broke."
1,Power Mixer Pro,"I was mixing powder and water for diet product. This mixer only mixes the bottom of container, you have to shake mixer while mixing to get a good mix. The mixer is top heavy, which makes it hard to handle and clean properly.I got a jar with a lid on it. With the jar I got a better mix and it's not as heavy and cleans ups easier.Sorry it didn't work for me."
5,very happy customer,my item arrived in brand new condition and i was very happy with my purchase. i enjoyed playing it very much
4,Gerber MP600 Bluntnose Multi-Plier Review,"I bought this multi-plier for my Dad as Christmas gift. The tool is truly great! You can literally do everything described in its manual. My only disappointment was that the tungsten carbide inserts never arrived even though I specifically chose the set that came with those and paid extra. Otherwise, my father loves this tool and uses it all the time."
2,Overall Disappointment,"I saw this toy when my daughter was six months old and wanted it so bad for her to play with. I bought her one for her first birthday, although she already knew how to walk, I felt it would be fun for her to ride on. I was so excited to get it home and open it, once it was ready to go, she had the hardest time getting the hippo to move ( as a ride on toy). Still at 16 months the toy does not stimulate her at all. She may play with it for 5-10 minutes at a time. My daughter is very smart and needs toys that keep her doing something and this toy just has nothelp her attention at all since I brought it home."
1,The hipo does not 'eat',"Buy it if you want a cute push toy, but the selling point 'it eats' is a lie."
3,Not as much fun as I thought,"We got this toy for my son's first birthday, thought he would really enjoy it since he loved the wagon and giraffe. Not so, he did not enjoy riding it and it was very hard for him to push because it does not turn easily. He is now 15 months and uses it as a stool to get into things he shouldn't. I would recommend the wagon, giraffe, and train much more so than this. Unless of course you are using it as just a ride on toy."
2,lame.,"bought this for my son when he was about 18M. he played with it but he didn't really enjoy it too much. it just kind of sat around. this toy is really hard to move when on carpet, it gets stuck. if you have a very heavy kid, probably around 23+ lbs their weight pushes it down so hard that it can't go forward very easily. not a very good toy overall. wouldn't get again."
5,SRAM MRX front shifter,Shifter was a perfect replacement for the bike's original Falcon shifter and a bit of an upgrade in quality too. Installation instructions were easy to follow and installation was easy.
1,BEWARE - this item has tripled in price. It's not a good deal now.,"It was a good deal at one third the current price. This company never made a bit in the same class as a Freud or CMT product, which is where it's priced now."
5,What the heck,"I do not own this either, but thought I would balance the other reviews of guys who do not own this. I have the straight edge and it is nice. This is just the wide jaw clamps. I do not know how they could make it clearer."
4,How Things can Change!,"This is a most enjoyable piece of writing. We in Ireland probably suspect a little tongue in cheek but that makes the tale even more enjoyable. The great thing is that with the subject matter in this novel, it would be so easy to be irreverent, but Joseph Hennessy at no time came even close to that temptation.The entire mixture of events is so possible that one sometimes has to remember that it is all in good fun and entertainment, but I was almost drawn in some occasions to feel sorry for the poor cleric trying to cope with such new and unforeseen situations.Thank you Joseph, hope there more where that came from, really enjoyable."
5,So that is what I was doing wrong!!!,"Prior to purchasing this book, I had attempted to install crown molding in two separate rooms. I read everything I could find on-line and in my Home Depot how-to books on the subject. But still I just could figure out why I wasn't able to get my joints to look good. In the end I cheated and bought some of those pre-made interior and exterior joints. After a ton of work the rooms looked ehhhh.In comes this book. After just spending ten minutes reading through the clearly laid out steps that the author provides, I found at least four things I had been doing wrong. It was as if a light bulb just went off over my head. The next day, using pre-painted pieces (great tip btw!!) my wife and I completely installed crown molding in a room with several funky corners. And guess what, it looks amazing.I am very happy with this book purchase. Its clear instructions and the tools provided unveiled what previously had been a real mystery."
1,dont buy this or any of their other albums,"hey redawg stick to music in the uk. the raps on this cd are horrible. bone was and is better than they ever will be. their styles are whack the backyard country styles are something fit for west virginia and their pockets are now empty. stick to the farm cc, because you saw what happened when you tried something different"
4,Good product,I like this back pack I do wish it had better room for pliers and channel locks. It has plenty of room for other things and it cleans easy.
2,Not worth it,"Great idea, bad design. Although the pockets are neat and convenient, the back pack is uncomfortable. The weight of the drill and hardware case (when full) pulls the pack down and away from you. In addition, the shoulder straps are cheap and not well designed. It would help to have a chest strap to clip the two shoulder straps together like on the hiking packs. The pack is also too big and bulky. Back problems have occured. Im going back to my $40.00 NorthFace pack. Much more confy."
4,"Holds plenty of tools, but can get heavy","This bag works perfect for my needs. I'm a stationary engineer. When I have an issue in my building, I'll throw this bag over my shoulder and head to the problem area. I have most everything I need for a first response to anything I might encounter in my bag. Its taking some time to remember where all my particular tools are located inside though. Forget about loading a power drill in it like the pictures show unless its a very tiny one. There are no tool pockets located on the outside of the bag so it appears like an everyday backpack. I tend to carry it with me on the train to work everyday so I'm glad to have my tools contained inside without worry of them spilling all over the train floor. Very well constructed with good KYY zippers. Time will tell how well it holds up, but it looks like it will do fine."
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased this item for my son's seventh birthday, thinking it would be fun, however you almost never manage to pick anything up with the crane, and after only a few trys the child decides this really is no fun at all."
1,This item gave me migraines.,"I waited for this item, which was supposedly in stock at the time of order, for over two months. I repeatedly called customer service to inquire about my order (which was a gift) and constantly received contradictory answers - always saying the item was in the warehouse but hadn't shipped. When it finally did arrive, the machine didn't work. One of the claw levers didn't function, and the claw would not open and close to pick up prizes. I ended up returning it and buying a similar variation of the toy (from a different vendor, which ended up being cheaper) which I love. I will never order from Target through Amazon again."
2,worst present ever,"Worst present ever when i got it out of the box it worked fine,but about three minutes later it would not go side to side and later on it made a horrible sqeaking sound when it moved up and down.I could hardly pick anything up with the claw.p.s.I have to tilt it sideways to get anything out of it."
4,Fantastic learning tool for the beginner to intermediate stu,"I would have given the product a 5 star review if it could have found the contents of the Lesson CD I copied to my laptop hard drive. You are forced to use the Lesson CD in the CD drive to work the program.The program is a very good learing tool. You learn to hear, read, speak and write in the language. The early lessons at first seem too easy, until you get to the unit that has you type in the words or phrases for the image you are viewing. That's when the learning starts. The advanced lessons will have you typing whole paragraphs.Better by far than any Berlitz programs etc. that you commonly find at a computer store.You won't truly learn a language until you can write in it. This one gives you a really good start!"
3,Learn vocabulary fast,"The Rosetta stone teaches by 'complete immersion'. Using picture context the student asborbs vocabulary with ease. Immediate rewards for correct answers help motivate the learner to keep working. However, there are some weaknesses. First, you need to have a reliable dictionary on hand. There are times that you come to wrong conclusions about word meaning and you must double check with a dictionary. Second, this course is weak in grammar. I recommend a text to demonstrate basic grammatical structures. Last, this software does not give separate phonetic information. you are expected to learn by listening. Certain individuals, based on learning style may want to see phonetic information in print."
3,Maybe not.,"After whetting our appetites with the observation that little is known about the man behind the plays, the A&E team provides a bland, surprisingly unengaging ""5-act"" biography of William Shakespeare. As the story proceeds, the producers rely more and more on quotations from the plays rather than on any ""extrinsic"" evidence. The result is a program that confirms what we already knew, or should have known, all along--the life of William Shakespeare is at best a mere footnote to the life of the plays themselves. Credit the producers for not indulging in this series' customary approach and sensationalizing the records (by claiming Shakepeare was really Queen Elizabeth, etc.). On the other hand, teachers and students of Shakespeare, as well as fans of the Bard, may find it difficult to justify an investment of money in a video this slight when, say, Olivier's ""Henry V"" or Branagh's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" are available at a comparable price."
1,not what I ordered,From the picture it looks like a normal car charger with a cord. What I received was a cigarette lighter plug with a place to plug a USB cord into it.
1,Made in China,"Made in China, not waterproof, this is an umbrella for shade only, I realized after I threw out the box that it was crooked and pole is made out of cheap orangy plastic and not wood. I tossed it and bought a beautiful waterproof ""real wood"" one at Bed, Bath & Beyond for $31.99. Cons of buying on the internet when you can't see the merchandise in person I guess."
2,Didn't last a month with out breaking,"Was VERY disappointed with this product about 2 -3 weeks into using it I realized the primary belt loop started to tear, the rest of it seems to be built sturdy (so far) but the one thing that is meant to keep this product on you just seems to be made of shotty and unreliable materiel both the treading holding it on & the belt loop it self seem to of given out WITHOUT MUCH USE AT ALL. The only reason it got any stars at all is because it seemed to hold nice amount of supply's (ie a knife, sharpie, SMALL pocket flashlight, multie-tool,) for a ""Medium - small"" belt pouch... BUT WHAT GOOD IS IT IF IT WON'T SECURELY ATTACH TO YOU BELT!?"
2,Not for me,"Item was not what I expected, it was way to big and bulky. The quality of the pouch seems to be good and the metal hook to attach to your belt is a pretty neat feature if you need to remove it without undoing your belt."
5,holster,"holds alot, I removed clip that dangles. I do firealarm work and carry...both bit kits for leathermanbit driver with socket adaptersocket set metric n saemaglightbrushmarkerspen screwdriver from wallyworld"
2,No Music on this NEW DVD,"Three brand new Yes DVD's for 2007:An imported ""ABWH"", which is great but this release cost half a hundred dollars!.""Live at Montreux"", from 2003 which was super painful to watch. Medicine helps.And our featured new DVD, ""Close to the Edge: Rock Milestones"". It's a Documentary, insulting & hurtful to long time Yes Fans. The 'experts' tell us everything Yes did after CTTE was ""DOWNHILL!"". They also said some terrible things about Alan White. No reason for that.Yes is my all time favorite band, and it is obvious now we will never see them together again in Concert. The 2004 ""Songs from Tsongas 35th Anniversary Concert"", released last year captured the band at the end of their stellar career going out in style. I even got to touch Jon as he strolled through the audience. A first, and last. God bless Yes!"
5,Stellar,"I almost died when I heard MTV announce that they would be broadcasting a Fleetwood Mac reunion. Needless to say, I was glued to the TV that night. My coffee table could've been on fire and I still wouldn't have moved. The band is in peak form. There's Christine, regally perched at her keys. The legendary Stevie, dancing like a Witch at Samhain, and Lindsey, arguably one of the best rock guitarists out there, John, singing for the first time (albeit backup), and Mick, with the wild faces. How many over 50 rock bands still have drum solos?That said, I must say that Stevie's voice sounds.. well, different. At parts, she kind of sounds like Marianne Faithfull doing a wicked impression of Stevie Nicks. Not that that's a bad thing! I worship Stevie, and Marianne! Stevie's voice, though the upper register is gone, definitely still retains great tonal quality, and it has a lovely vintage to it.So, in short, the Mac are back, and I couldn't be happier."
5,Fleetwood Mac The Dance,"I'm not a rock and roll fan, however, this DVD is very well done by a group of real professionals, and even more importantly, it's a heck of a lot of fun!"
2,"""The Dead""","This DVD should have been called ""TheDead"".All the band members except Mick look like they are bored & uptight. Mick looks like he's awake. That's a step in the right direction. Do not buy this DVD if you are thinking about showing off your home theatre. The sound stinks. Buy this only if you are a Fleetwood Mac Fanatic.Sound engineers need to get thier act together so that the consumer has a standard that they can expect when purchasing DVD 5.1 as well as DTS."
4,About the audio,"Just got this DVD. It must be that some of the early copies of this DVD were defective in some way. While the audio is not up to the James Taylor or the Roy Orbison DVDs (hence the 4 stars, would give 4.5, if I could), it is still of high quality. It is not flat nor non-detailed as one reviewer mentioned, so I would not let that influence my purchasing decision. The concert itself is great with tremendous musicianship."
5,A Must Have for Learning a Language on Your Schedule,"Its easy to use, very effective, and can be used anywhere a laptop computer can be used - for me that's a commuter train."
4,"Sgt. Rock (r) DJ Services - Cinti., OH (spinning since 1976)","Great deck for the money, features are well thought-out w/respect to ergonomic location, labeling, etc. Downside to this unit (as with so many others) is the relatively poor documentation found in the owners manual - difficult to read. Manual basically labels component features but provides no additional info as to their practical use or interaction. For instance; the unit boast of ""Fader-start"". However, this will only work with certain models of DJ mixers - the manual does not list compatible models, nor does it list the tech specs on the ""fader-start"" interconnects."
2,"Starts well, ends poorly","Although it is well written, with an interesting premise and the makings of a good plot, it all falls apart in the last chapters. It's as though all of the mystery is resolved with a hearty ""nevermind""."
5,The Alarm Clock Just Went Off,I just woke up from sleeping on this album. I just purchased this album a few weeks ago. This album is crazy. I miss the 90's hip-hop. It has that gutter NY sound that I love. Great album. I can listen to just about every song. Definitely worth the purchase. Classic material. Does not sound like a young teenager. Lyrics are on point. sound like a young AZ and Nas.
2,Collectors Item Only- not for 21st century use,"I have nothing against Brahms' Requiem. I have nothing against Karajan. What I am against is EMI's outer packaging which does not indicate whatsoever that this recording occurred in 1947 until you rip off the shrinkwrap and look in the insert. I'm sure the recording quality is magnificent by 1947 standards, but it is now a different millenium and digital remastering can only do so much. The The only reason I can see why EMI decided to release this recording is for connoisseurs who are not satisfied with Karajan's other recording(s?) of Ein Deutsches Requiem. I don't have much else to say. I feel duped and I write this only to warn others."
2,Emalia Jones Needs to Learn to Write!,"I found this book poorly written. Jones often uses a whole paragraph to say something which can be summed in a sentence. She often uses ""post modern words"" when her idea could more easily be communicated simply - in english. Some of her [good!] ideas fit the works she writes about but she doesn't seem to notice when they don't. Her aproach tends to flatten the works she writes about to the relm of sexual politics without allowing for their other, often contradictory meanings."
3,magnaflow drone,"System was easy to install, but droned terribly. So bad, it would almost give you a headache. I purchased a magnaflow stainless round muffler to use as a resonator. The resonator quieted the overall noise level, but still had the drone. Insulated the floor of the trunk and under the rear seat with sound deadening material. Still had the drone. Finally I installed 2 car chemistry inserts behind the resonator to kill the drone."
3,so-so,"Not the best way to learn japanese (especially using it as your only resource). You'll learn quite a bit of vocabulary, but it can get a bit confusing once they start the grammer. If you know pretty basic grammer, then this is good practice.The reason i gave 3 stars is because i think it's VERY good for reading practice. You can switch the display anytime between kanji, kana, and romaji."
3,A Fine Concept that Lacks Something in Implementation,"The idea behind this book is a sound one. The author takes from his vast collection of railfan photos and points out ideas that would be useful for model railroaders. The problem is that there are plenty of nice photos, a few bright ideas and, on occasion, a well thought out observation on what will cause problems or be innovative but there is precious little on making actual use of any of these ideas.He does give lists of parts from various suppliers that might be made to fit certain scenes but there is almost nothing of the ""how to"" variety. Its basically an idea book. There are better idea books out there. This is not to say that this book is worthless; it is not. There are some good ideas in here. I just wish there were more."
3,Great book for summarizing Shaklee philosophy,"In my Shaklee business, I constantly hear about how our company utilizes products in harmony with nature. Here is a book that helps to give information on the natural forms of healing! Great book!"
1,Too tight,"I purchased these for the swelling in my ankles, and I ordered a size up from my actual calf size and they were still too tight. I thought that I may have measured my leg wrong so I had my daughter (who is very petite) try them on and she couldn't even get them on. I don't know if these were sized wrong or if it's supposed to be painful to wear them (which I wouldn't think that would be the case), anyway, they are still in the box collecting dust!! For the price this was disappointing, as they weren't cheap (especially for socks). I recommend buying from a store where you can return them if they don't fit properly."
4,the prada paradox,"I've read the first two books in the PSW trilogy, and this installment (the final one) did not disappoint me. We meet a new character, Devi Taylor, who the author develops pretty well for this kind of book. Of course, she ends up playing PSW, but, this time, she plays it with 2 other players, instead of one. All of this comes about in an interesting way. Again, the book is very fast paced, and I couldn't put it down.The only negatives would be that it was incredibly easy to figure out who was behind PSW. I found it a little hard to believe that the characters were that out of it. I wasn't very satisfied with who was behind PSW, but the book was still great."
5,The Natural Nutrition No-Cook Book,This book is very informative and well written.The recipes are inviting and well accepted by my family.Glad I found this.
1,Love the shoe - hate the sellers,"I ordered this shoe sometime around 12/6/11, hoping it would arrive by the 13th when I knew I'd have a client function for work and these shoes would be comfortable and dressy. I already own the brown pair and have been searching for a pair of black. Well, I didn't get them by the date of the party...then not by the date of my office party...and not the next week...and not even before Christmas! Nothing ever said ""out of stock"" etc so I just kept waiting for them to arrive when they said they'd be shipped by the 8th! So today, I've finally received an email stating the order was cancelled because they're out of stock! The sellers should just be honest that they don't actually HAVE the shoes to sell instead of stringing folks along. I am extremely dissatisfied!"
3,"light weight, nice for the summer, wheels are a dud","Our #1 priority was weight b/c we've been using a very heavy full size stroller. This was the lightest model in the store. Here's our likes/dislikes:LIKES:* extremely lightweight* great material (you can roll up the fabric and expose the mesh backing)* no sweating!!! (see the above explanation)* very neutral (we have the tan model)* easy to fold up* 2 storage bags are quite convenientDISLIKES:* the WHEELS!!! (i think we got a dud, the front right tire never turned, then the other front one did the same after 3 months)"
5,Outstanding,"In years of study, I've found nothing better than this exhaustive study. I rarely give 5 star reviews, but this book deserves it."
2,The definitive history of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings,"A marvellous book! Very-well researched and reads like a technological detective story. This book is bound to become, or already is the definitive history on the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings in World War 2. The author has done a lot of research for this book to put all the details together for the events that took place over 60 years ago. His line of research can easily be followed by studying the Endnotes section in the book. If you liked reading ""The Paris Gun"" by Bull and Murphy or ""Most Secret War"" by Jones, then I am sure you are going to love reading this book. I did !! As a matter of fact I liked it so much that I bought a copy as a present for my brother who is an Honorary Member of the United States Army."
2,The story that went nowhere,"This book started off good, but as I kept reading, I realized I was waiting for someting to HAPPEN. Nothing did and about 1/2 way through I quit. Maybe I should have stuck it out, but I am too busy to waste time on a book that has no point."
1,Bunk science,"This is one of those silly, revisionist-style books with a thesis that is completely untenable.I have written a comprehensive rebuttal to this hypothesis, which is published on the main Shroud web site, - Answering the Savoy/Leonardo DaVinci Hypothesis:"
3,"good, but way too short for the $50 i paid!","this game has very good controls, and awsome graphix, every thing about this game is great, espeicaly the story, its like a whole new Riddick movie, but i beat it in 1.5 days! this game is too short. great game, but not worth the price tag!Rent it first if u can :)"
2,Does not meet expectations - try Pimsleur,"I spent a lot of money on this program, and, so far, all it's doing is MAYBE teaching me to RECOGNIZE what is being said - not to speak it. There is absolutely no English translation (in Level I anyway), no breakdown of pronunciation, and no opportunity to construct NEW sentences with words I've already learned. All you do is look at pictures and repeat what is already written or spoken to you. I've already made it through Pimsleur Spanish I and I'm into II and I've learned so much more. Pimsleur is slower on vocabulary, but when you learn it, you learn how to conjugate and incorporate it into an original sentence. The bottom line is, I feel Rosetta stone can only be used as a supplement to other programs I'm studying - a very expensive supplement."
3,Neither Here Nor There. . .,"I purchased this book expecting a fairly detailed analysis of the writing of these subjects. Not so; there was only one page per subject, containing a sample of their writing with little notes placed around the sample. The biographies were very rudimentary, but they took up eighty per cent of the subjects' spaces. I knew who these women were, I wanted to see what a graphologist would make of their writing. Not only that, but in several places in the book the analysis of the same sample was contradictory. I wouldn't buy it again, at least not at the full price."
5,Perfect for Sportster,I bought this to relocate the speedometer on my 2010 Harley Davidson Iron 883 (xl883n) It came well packaged and exactly as depicted with all necessary hardware. I painted it with two coats of black rustoleum to match the bike. The speedometer was a perfect fit and mounted directly onto the motorcycle with no need to make additional holes on the bracket nor the bike. This was a great modification to clean up the handlebar area and to lower the appearance of the bike. I will post a picture.
3,cute sweater,It is cute but thin material not sure it will keep my dog warm other than that cute wiil shop for anotther
2,rosettta stone,"After reading all the reviews of this product, I thought it would be a snap to learn Italian with it. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. I'll grant you, it is a lot of fun, with the interactive aspect of speaking and testing pronunciation. However, it has taught me a whole lot of stupid phrases I cannot imagine myself ever needing, but very little actual conversational language. I mean, really, do I need to know how to say the children are jumping off the table, or the horse is kissing the woman? I'd rather be able to ask where the train station is, what time the next bus is due, or be able to order a meal in a restaurant.Definitely not what I expected or hoped for."
5,Be prepared to learn,"While I've tried many different solutions for learning the italian language, this is by far the best. But you still have to be ready to work, because this is no simple task and this program gives you everything you need. You can have guided learning, do it on your own, and make tests afterward, all of which are tracked to help you see how you're doing.I only recommend that you also get a good book on grammar, to help supplement what you're learning here, since it has a focus on recognition and not sentence structure or verb conjugation."
2,broken in 20 months,"It's been working OK for a while. But, 20 month later, SD reader is not working and USB port is now operating at a slower speed. (Windows 7 is reporting the port is not a Hi-Speed.) And my SD card is broken at the same time, coincidence? I don't know."
3,Colin: Real man of genious,"Finally got around to watching it. While it is classic improv, it felt too short. As a fan of ""Who's Line"" it is enjoyable."
2,uh..........,"I suggest watching the original version: Sword of Doom - which is amazing. A lot less acid is involved, and less cliche. Izo is a rent, at best."
2,"""Life is Hell. Death is Hell, too.""","Well Miike fans here we go with a movie that I didn't like. It's definitely strange enough and bloody enough but it's also too long, too boring and it doesn't have that Miike feel to it, like say DEADLY OUTLAW: REKKA, ICHI THE KILLER, YAKUZA DEMON or GOZU. It felt like Miike was just cashing a check.From what I gathered Izo was an evil samurai who's crucified and speared to death. His spirit goes into an eternal Hell where he uncontrollably jumps from place to place throughout time and dimensions. Wherever he lands he kills people then just jumps to somewhere else and he does this over and over again and again and again for two hours.Unless you're a diehard Miike fan I'd skip it. If you're looking for a more straightforward and rewarding samurai movie then check out THE TWILIGHT SAMURAI or SWORD OF DOOM or if you're looking for some quality non-Miike weirdness watch Sasaki's CRAZY LIPS."
3,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz *Snore*,"Well...Hmm...I don't know what to say about this book but that it was boring. I enjoyed the early development of Nathan and Victoria's relationship, Nathan's caretaking of his animals as well as the mystery surrounding his fall from grace.But the problem here was that all this took place within the first sixty pages or so of the book. From then on, it was the same old thing over and over. Their desire for one another was there from the beginning thus the build-up just wasn't there for me. I'm in the minority here. Oh well..."
3,Good tool once you figure out how to attach it,"Purchased my plate from Rockler. The directions how to attach the plate to your circular saw leave something to be desired - all you get is a crudely drawn diagram on the back of the package. I ended up using metal screws to attach to my circular saw base plate. However, I found out when I tried to follow the directions, it becomes necessary to remove the plate to change saw blades. It would have been better if the unit had some provision to clamp the saw to the plate, so it'd be easier to manage. Even though, it does work wonderfully once you get the saw configured. Just don't think attachments will be effortless."
4,Smells like Sh*t!!! But buyer beware,"This stuff smells like rotten eggs. EXACTLY. But the smell does not immediately take effect, it takes about 5mins, but its time to get away. Jeeze! I just dont understand who could work in a factory making these! but anyways i thought this was a pack of 2, but it is only one yet they(A&M books and toys)sell the same thing for much cheaper with free shipping as well. This is great for pranks, but i believe the ones in the blue box just have that little extra UMPH that makes their smell more potent. Overall for houses: YES- For stores/warehouse pranking: probably not the best. Liquid Ass is for that."
3,Eh....,Word '07 is overpriced and complicated. This book helps you get what you need from the program.
5,What an offering!,"This is metalcore that is beautifully brutal. Revelations of the unsung has great breakdowns, that arent played out, and very little singing.The album really consists of screaming. For one song, Phil Labonte from All that remains does guest vocals and the outcome was heartstopping. Jamey Jasta of Hatebreed heard these kids and signed them soon after. Word got out about how good these guys are and then Victory snatched them right up. The bass player wrote this album at 15 years old! (he is now 20) Their new album is due in May, be on the look out, they might be pretty big. This is for fans of : Unearth and Darkest Hour"
5,Quality product from Gerber.,"A compact (and slightly heavy) multi-tool.It won't replace your tool box, but you get many smaller jobs done on the spot instead of wasting time running back for tools needed."
5,Voice of an angel,"This woman warms my heart. We have seen her live and my wife and I consider ourselves big fans. The lyrics cut through layers without feeling pretentious or shallow. Amazing balance, grace, sense of humor and earnestness. Buy this CD."
4,"Hoping the best, while I go through Windows and it's Office....","Hoping... I just bought it, but previous versions have always being very handy, even gratifying. Thank you!!"
4,Office 2007 for Dummies,"I am no longer feeling like a dummy using the Andy Rathbone ""Windows Vista for Dummies!!!Thanks"
5,Marvelous Marv,"It's a thick paper back book. Didn't want to mess up the binding trying to get it to lay flat. Took the book to a printing company, they turned it into two books with a sprial binding allowing the books to lay flat. The information in the books are page turners. With the taking of the computer class, my computer books close at hand; I getting better on the computer. Computer help is welcomed and Amazon helped with the books.Marvelous Mrv"
5,Book Review,"If you have Office 2007, this book is a MUST for you. Very easy to read and understand. This book will teach you things about Office 2007 you did not know."
1,office 2007 for dummies,"The product has very basic information. I purchased the book to find out how to do many things within Office Outlook and the information was simply not there. I was looking to learn how to manage and update my ""Archive Folder"" it didn't have the information available. Disappointing based upon the cost."
1,Bad taste,"Ordered for all natural toothpaste. However, it has a horrible taste. I still use it on occasion. But, do not like the taste."
4,that idiot is so stupid,Madball is my favorite hardcore band around... Hold it Down is probably their best work. Its between this and DMS.Pick it up if u remotely like hardcore music... madball rocks...
4,Last Hurraa!!!!!!,"I dont think anyone outside of NYC could really appreciate this band. As anyone who has ever played in or been involved in the hardcore scene will tell you, putting out an album is really just an excuse for playing live shows at back ally clubs. OK, I guess these guys get props for being in the NYC scene for this long along with Sick of It All and others but sadly, the hayday for this music is long gone. With the GAP-ification of the infamous St. Marks and the demise of NYC clubs like Coney Island High and other great places, NYC hardcore will probably never live up to it's glorious past. NYCHC is dead.... Long live NYCHC!!!"
5,This is the type of album that should be winning Grammys,"I first heard Childhood Drama(remix) on Radio AOL a few months ago and i was dazed, i went out to the local music store at the mall hoping but doubting they would carry the album, luckily they had it, and i was truly amazed that i hadnt heard of this Goapele before. I must say i cant wait for the second album, and i listen to this one everyday, its usually the only thing in my car CD player."
4,wonderful voice,"I saw Goapele in concert with Donnie, Julie Dexter, and Fertile Ground in DC. She was incredible and her voice was just magical. I bought the cd because I was blown away by her voice. I love the cd...especially the songs ""Things Don't Exist"" and ""Catch 22"". Her voice is unique and powerful and her song writing ability is amazing. This CD is a great addition to any collection. You won't be disappointed."
3,Good but not excellent,"I watched the movie ""Daylight"", the movie no one's ever heard before and I really thought the music was good...in the movie. When I put the CD in the CD Player I thought the main theme at the near beginning was pretty good. And when they repeated it again in the second one I thought ""Well good. Mr. Edelman's a conformist"" but when it repeated again in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, basically every song in the whole @#$% CD has that theme in it! But some parts were good, I even saw slight hints of ""The Last of the Mohicans"" in it!The movie talks about the indominable human spirit that never gives up, at least that's what I thought of it, and the music sounded more like a bee hive than anything emotional. Well maybe except some parts. Generally, I think the main melody is too repetetive. Maybe if someone like Trevor Jones or James Horner had done the music for ""Daylight"" then it would have been better. Sorry Mr. Edelman, you tried."
3,"Good, but not great","While I found this score to be nice most of the time, there were a few times when it got monotonous, and too heavy. This detracts from it, and drags it down to a three star from a four. It does sound very much like an Edelman score though, and has hints of the well known (And one of my personal favorites) Dragonheart. What's nice in it, is pretty good, and it also has driving action cues, that are not dissonant, or not even really music, which is a plus. Another example of such music would be The Rock. One thing that I would also say takes away from the soundtrack are the songs at the end, mainly the last one. So I would say that this is still a soundtrack worth getting, although it's just not one of the tops, at least on my list."
2,Mediocre in every way,"This was a seventh anniversaty gift, and being made of copper is its only real benefit. Two of the welded connections between the rings were broken upon receipt and it's light and relatively shabby in construction.It's difficult to find a 7th anniversary gift made of copper, and to that end, this fit the bill. But its real value, even for the intended purpose, is very limited."
2,Disappointed,"As with the review before me, I also received this rack with 2 broken welds on the single circle at the end tip. It is nice looking, but poorly constructed."
5,TERRIFIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The first time I listened to this album, I bought a blood-orange margarita to go and walked around NYC groovin' with my headphones on. Gee, that was last summer, before the world went crazy......when I listen now I immediately mellow out. You cannot go wrong with this one - there are so many great songs and all kinds of moods - it isn't too mellow, not too funky. I just love it!!!"
4,Lost And Found,"This debut from New York's southside Jamica, Queens crew led by Mr. Cheeks has made boyz with their hustlin', partying, street grooves on Legal Drug Money. With memerable, catchy hooks and freestyle rhymes the Lost Boyz had themselves an almost classic. Their party, upbeat joints like ""Music Makes Me High"" and ""Get Up"" are what makes this such a hot commodity. On the other end of the spectrum we have ""Renee"". This is a song mourning over a death. Besides, Mr. Cheeks uses the word love and keeps it raw and hardcore. Member Freaky Tah also represented on here with Mr. Cheeks and with a solo song, ""1,2,3"". Going back to their most obvious freestyle flow, listen to the two of them on ""All Right"". A couple more upbeat tracks would have absolutely made this a classic."
2,Not worth the price!!!,This pillow is NOT worth the price!!!!!!! It has very little stuffing in it........ Its not very fluffy.......... Kinda flat and it has two different sections. It is not very comfortable and only slightly better than no pillow at all!!!!!!!!Look into better options for the price!!!!
1,Lost its loft within a couple weeks,"If you weigh more than 100 lbs prior to your pregnancy, don't purchase this pillow. I purchased it to change from being a stomach to a side sleeper. However, I have four months to go in my pregnancy and am having hip pain. I have written a letter to Boppy, but have received no response."
1,"Useless, saggy, and expensive","I don't even know what to say. This pillow is so bad! It's too flat to align hips. Awkward under my head, probably too flat there. There is no stuffing where the pillow lies at my stomach so it is useless to support my belly. Quite honestly, I'm not sure what Boppy is thinking on this one.I ended up with a snoogle and LOVE it!"
5,A fun time,"Mary Stella has developed a fun, fast paced summer read. If you can't get away to a sun drenched beach, or island, or The Keys, then try this book. A beer, a lemonade, a hammock, or an armchair and you'll be set to take the journey with these fun-loving and quirky characters. The setting is great and the author has truly captured life in The Keys. I enjoyed reading the older heroine's story, her loss and devastation, and her gumption as she faces returning to the small town where she grew up, and rebuilding her life while everyone watches her. All of the secondary characters are well drawn and bring much to the page. And the hero is young, yummy, and determined. And what's better in a hero?"
5,Insight into the Feminine (and Masculine) from a true Priestess perspective,"I love ""Under Her Wings: The Making of a Magdalene"" and the insight into the 'struggle"" women face in a male dominated society. And it isn't even the male dominated society that it the issue. It is simply the emergence (and the effort involved) in women rediscovering themselves and the effort (in the face of a great deal of odds) to unfold and become their true nature. This book has changed my life and changed my understanding of my relationship with women. It is becoming my experience to experience women in a ""fuller"" and more whole manner, and for this I am grateful.I would like to write a more complete review and I will do as I have a spare moment. But for the time being, I applaud Nicole for her work and recommend her book.NamasteJ.Hamilton"
2,Great Idea but POOR QUALITY!!,"My three children love playing with this toy...well I should say lovED playing with this toy before it totally fell apart. All of the doors have come off, the automatic doors don't work and never have. The top M for McDonalds has been breaking off since day one. Too bad, because it's really a pretty cool toy in concept. I sure wish this child's toy could actually be used by a child!"
5,Hours of Fun!,"My son's friend had this and he always wanted to go over to his house to play with it. I broke down and bought it for him. It was difficult to put together, but well worth it. He plays for hours and hours preparing and serving food. He also loves the cash register on it and is learning about paying for things as well as cooking and serving. It is a little bit flimsy, but it's been holding up pretty well. I would recommend this for preschoolers!!!"
4,Lots of fun but very flimsy!,"My daughter is two and she does enjoy playing with this toy alot and I have a nephew who is 4 and he loves his as well. That said, this toy is very flimsy, both sets of doors have fallen off and will not stay on and the cardboard containers for the food was a terrible idea. I only paid 24.99 for mine through another toy store so I do not feel that I overpaid for it but I would not have paid the price that Toys R Us has it for. It is a great concept and if Little Tikes had made it, this toy would have been perfect!"
5,Grandson Loves This,I purchased this for my grandson I just get a kick out of him fixing me mickey-d's play food. You would think he believes that he really works there.
5,Very satisfied,"This toy was mailed to my grand-daughter and grand-son. They love, love, love the toy. They play with it all the time. I am also satisfied with the price and mail service, everything went as promised. Thank you."
5,MCDONALD'S FOOD CART IS A WONDERFUL START!!,"I RECENTLY BOUGHT THE MCDONALD'S FOOD CART FOR MY 2-YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. I WANTED TO WAIT UNTIL CHRISTMAS BUT I COULDN'T. IT'S SO CUTE! TOYS R'US HAD IT AT AN OUTSTANDING PRICE OF [amount]AND BELIEVE ME IT'S WELL WORTH THE MONEY. AS A FORMER MANAGER OF MCDONALD'S I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT ALL THE SOUNDS ARE REALISTIC. IT CAME WITH ALL THE NECESSARY FOOD ITEMS MY DAUGHTER NEEDED TO RUN HER ""MCDONALD'S DRIVE THRU"". I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TOY FOR LITTLE ONES WHO LIKE TO BE IN THE KITCHEN. IF BUYING FOR A CHRISTMAS GIFT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER GETTING THE HEAD-SET BECAUSE IT COMES WITH A MCDONALD'S HAT AND THE CHILD WILL TRULY BELIEVE HE/SHE IS A CREW MEMBER. FROM A MCDONALD'S LOVING FAMILY."
3,Very disappointing..,"My two daughters were so excited to open this on Christmas morning. And just as I expected, when I put it together the week before, it was broke by that night. The play food is made very cheap, the bolts fell off very easy. We hadn't even had it four months before getting rid of it. I only wish I had that 40.00$ back. Save your money..."
2,Watch your toddlers around this!,"Okay for an older child, but beware if you have any curious toddlers around. My son poked his head in one of the ""cupboards"" and got stuck! Very scary, but luckily he came out with only a bruise on his cheek."
4,"Very pretty, light weight...","This is a very pretty pattern and it goes beautifully with the dishes I bought it for. I especially love that it can be washed in the dishwasher. Yay! from my kids who have to clean up the kitchen after dinner. I am taking one star off my rating because this flatware is very light, not what I would expect from something with gold highlights and this much detail. Still, I love using it and would recommend it for anytime you want to spruce up your everyday or semi formal place settings. Not for really formal dinners, though."
5,Amazon sell auto parts?,I am very happy with the water pump I bought from Amazon. It is high quality and was $15.00 less than the local NAPA part store. I shopped Amazon for the special tool required to replace the water pump in a Cadillac Northstar and was suprized to find the water pump. I did not know Amazon sells auto parts. Great.
3,WASSUP WITH THE MOUTH SONG?!,"Wassup people of amazon, yep! wassup with that nest in her head in the cover of the album?, she's nuts or what?!, besides the odd stament of the nest and the whole forest on her surroundings, this album that dates from 1996 is a perfect POP album that you cane asily listen on any Adult Recurrents radio, is easy songs, with easy messages and of course is easy to swallow, and that what it make's it great, the best tracks are the insinueting ""Mouth"", the dramatic ""Under The Water"", the mystical ""The Garden In My Room"", the melancolic ""Julie"", the absurd ""Spinning Around"", and the out of place ""Sleeping Dogs"", overall, ""The Garden"" by Merril Bainbridge is a simple POP album that achieves what it persudies, great for any fan of POP and AC music."
3,Mislabeled Item:,"i'm sure the product is Fine, but the photograph showing the back of the package does NOT belong to the SP-18 product.the seller was quick in responding, so i'm grateful for that. Just double check that the replacement blades you're ordering actually replace the blades from your razor's model number."
4,Good product,"When I ordered this product, it became out of stock.I got the money back in time.But I bought this product from other store and really liked it.Cons: No speaker phone and shows only last dialed number in redial list."
4,pretty good,"a have owned this dictionary for two months now and i have found it to be VERY up-to-date (when it comes to obsolete expressions) and helpful in reading modern US English literature. The reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's not the best for reading the idioms in classical books, again, due to the fact that the old idioms are not all included in this dictionary. overall, however, it is THE dictionary to buy if you want to learn a few idioms you could actually READ in the newspaper, HEAR in public, or NEED to USE in everyday speech. an extremely useful book, i recommend it."
1,Shameful Tribute,"I got word of this cd through word of mouth and had to buy it simply because I've been a Duranie since 1982. I figured it would be something spectacular, hoping for something comparably synonomous with the Carole King tribute cd several years back. The only song covered on this cd that is worth mentioning is the ""Save A Prayer"" remake by Eve's Plum (beatiful and haunting). The rest? Well, Those other ""bands"" tried way to hard or not hard enough... If I were an original Fab Five member, I'd be insulted."
5,Ceramic Silk,I fould this product at Sallys and really loved the way my hair looked after applying this. The product is no longer available at Sallys and I was able to find it on Amason. My hair is smooth and silky after I use this and it feels very healty.
5,Consistently fabulous!,"I promised myself I'd keep my review brief. So, I decided to describe the book (series) from my perspective: Well-balanced layering!!-Plot development and pace: perfect!-Dialogue: Real/brief/to-the-point!-Character development: just enough/just in time!-Mystery: inside of a mystery-under that mystery-wrapped around another mystery!-Romance: Refreshing/tasteful (I'm still looking for a feather)-Conclusion: Didn't see him coming! (Ready for the next installment)"
2,Navman with Rand McNally,"After using Microsoft Streets and Trips the Rand Mc Nally street finder deluxe I find the Microsoft far more useful.MS has many more features such as multipal stops,changeable routes, stops along the way,and every thing you need to plan a trip is on your hard drive. With the R M program your route planing is a down load off the web.You have no flexability to pick your route to avoid high traffic areas or major cities. With MS streets you have all these options plus! Tha navman web site offers a down load to use MS with The navman gps Antena.This combo works well together.The only thing good I found with R M is the gps display ,it gives you your current speed and average speed.This is great if you don'nt have a speedometer"
5,A BIG Success!!!!,We just did BIG the Musical in my High School Drama Club. The show is nothing below excellent. The songs are memorable and the music is highly melodic. It's a great show and an amazing album!
1,"Dont buy its a waste of your oils, time and money.",I had the diffuser for just a couple weeks and the diffuser burned the oils instead of slowly dispersing them. The thing wasnt even powerfull enough to work in one bedroom and broke after falling off of my 1 foot night stand onto my rug!!! Spend just a little more money on a better one or you'll regret it and end up having to replace it within a month or two.
4,Smells Good,Works as advertised. Fills my son's room with a much nicer aroma than dirty socks. Also helps him sleep better.
2,Serious Disappointment,"This vacuum has a very powerful moter and, as advertised, will actually pick up nuts and bolts neither of which I have laying around my kitchen floor. The filter design is lousey. It is not designed for the fine dust this machine can pick up and it fills up long before the ""cup"" designed to hold the nuts and bolts. I cannot finish vacuuming my kitchen floor without cleaning the dust filter at least once - and contary to what you may believe my floor is not filthy. I have contacted Black & Decker 2x's and their response it to send me more filters. The power of the machine is great, hopefully Black & Decker will redesign the filter system."
1,What a waist of my time and money! Can I give it less than a star?,"I own this humidifier for 3 years and always cleaned it with warm water and vinigar. Over this time some mineral scaling accumulated on the heating element and inside the tank, and I decided to give it a good cleaning with this ""fantastic"" product. It did NOTHING! It didn't remove any calcium AT ALL! I've used it as directed and even soaked the element for half an hour - nothing!Extremely disappointed, never buying it again!"
1,trash,this thing is trash. half the time the thing cant even figure out where it is. and when it does u drive a little farther and it gets lost again. Also it cant give you directions while you are on the road. to find directions you have to first use your computer and then transfer the directions to the palm. and I still cant figure out how to use my sd card with the product. I wish I could send it back.
2,Unacceptable,"I used to be a big fan of Adobe, but Premiere just took 12 hours to render a 30 minute movie, stalled three frames before finishing, and finally left me with a jerky, low quality version of the masterpiece I'd created. I spent weeks working on my baby, and Premiere gave me an abortion. Adobe's customer support representative wanted to charge me forty dollars PER QUESTION to figure out what was going wrong. Do you really want to spend nearly 800 dollars on this?"
3,Illistrated,"This was a very well composed and illistrated book, I own a fishing guide service and will always keep a copy on board of my boat for future referal of species and tips."
4,"Very quiet, kind of plastic-y, first order arrived broken","I've only had this fan for a few weeks, but here's my take so far. First, it arrived broken - a cap used to hold the top of the fan to the base was broken when it arrived. Amazon immediately shipped me a new one, but the breakage only added to my concern that this is a fan made of plastic, and it feels cheap. It works, so far, and it's inexpensive, and it is very quiet for a fan, so those are the pluses. My first fan of this type, these oscillating fans, I got from a hardware store 20 years ago. The thing worked for 18 years, then died. It was metal. These new fans feel cheaper, and I have a hard time imagining them working for 20 years (got a fan from a different company a few years back and it died after 2 to 3 years). No idea how long this one will last, and it is inexpensive, so we'll see."
2,Not what was promied,"This fan was reported to be very quiet and reliable, but after I put it together (not a hard task at all), it was considerably noisier than I had hoped. It was about as noisy as other small table fans I've bought. Not terrible, but certainly not the soft hush I had hoped for. The biggest problem was that the fan only worked on two of the three motor speeds!!! Although it created a strong breeze, the lack of quiet and the defective speeds don't make it a great bargain."
2,LOW COST BUT LOW VALUE,I purchased this fan to replace a fifteen year old Panasonic fan with failing bearings. The Lasko fan vibrates and is noisy. The fan actually bounces on the wire shelf it sits on. The molded fan blade appears to be of poor quality. I would not buy another fan like this one. I am now replacing the bearings on the old fan instead.
3,Product Isn't Bad for the money,"I purchased the fan to use at work. It was easy to put together for the most part, but almost all the parts are plastic. This caused me some problems when it came to the part used to secure the fan blades onto the fan. This part doesn't come pre-threaded so you have to basically force it onto the screw. And for me, I couldn't get a snug-enough fit for the fan to be quiet. I ended up taking the fan apart, folding up a paper towel, putting a hole in the center of the towel, putting it on the screw and then putting the plastic piece back on again. After I did this, the fan was amazingly quiet."
3,"Works, but it's not the best","I bought this fan from another supplier, preferring a 12 or 16"" oscillating fan over smaller units as they make less noise.Pros:- It's attractive- Base-mounted speed control (easy to change speeds)- No tools required for assembly- Inexpensive- Tilts without loosening a knobCons:- The speeds are too close together. (Medium and high aren't that different.)- ""Low"" produces too much air flow and noise, when all I really want is a whispery breeze.- Oscillating range is only about 65 - 70 degrees, rather than a full 90+.On the whole, it works. I'll likely return this one, though, in favor of buying a used one like my older units (from the 70s and 80s) that run quieter and oscillate across a wider angle.If you like the look of a new fan, this one's fine, unless you absolutely want a quieter ""Low"" speed."
2,disapointed,"I thought I would go with a name brand,the first thing was the name plate was falling off just out of the box,what does this say about quality? second the fan wobbles like it is missing a bushing.It does however have a good strong motor,this is one thing I wanted.My replacement is comong soon,we will see.I will stick with this brand, maybe this fan was one in a million?"
3,the o.k.?,this thing is a 3 star item no more no less it is ok but does not have all the fraises that you would want just if the price was a little bit cheaper then it would become 4 or even 5 star but the extra freatures are always nice to have.
1,Totally cliche death metal band,"Eh,I prefer to listen to a band where every other word isnt ""satan"". I mean bible basher is a catchy song that i sorta like and i guess the gift that keeps on giving is....ok.I had this cd at one point and ending up giving it away cause it was repetitive,I did the same thing with ""once upon the cross"".Besides that,now the hoffman brothers are out of the band.If u want to listen to death metal that doesnt just doesnt scream satan in every sentence try origin,exhumed,lord gore,and cryptopsy"
1,One star is way too high....,"I wish I could assign a rating in negative numbers. I've never been much of a fan of Deicide, particularly because I fail to find a shred of talent among them, but also because their shear failure to record anything that even remotely resembles real metal is insulting. And some people reviewing here call this... ""true metal,"" come on, people! The guitars are uninspired, the drumming amateurish, and the vocals... well, they sound like a trash compactor. If you people want some REAL metal, check out In Flames or Iced Earth, and let these tired posers fall by the wayside..."
2,Crap,Ice cubes are super small and don't even resemble a penguin once they have been removed. My recommendation is to go with a different shape because these trays are super cool
2,"Cute, but not functional","This looks very cute online, and in person... but using it is really difficult. When you pour water in it, it goes all over the place making a big mess. You have to have a steady hand to get the water right in the little penguins."
4,Definitely NOT Muzak,"I was first introduced to the Taliesin Orchestra with their album Maiden of Mystery. Their handling of Enya music suprized and delighted my ears. So when I saw this album, I couldn't resist. The music selection is far more difficult to translate into an instrumental piece, yet they do an admirable job. They get a bit over-the-edge with some of their intros, but all in all, it's an enjoyable listen.I recommend it."
2,Doesn't really give me a process,"I've read many screenwriting books, and this book didn't tell me anything I haven't read elsewhere. Walter has no real insight into the writing process, just some knowledge of the business which you can pick up from the other books. A disappointment."
2,Winston Please,"While I think that the Taliesin Orchestra is a very talented group, I really prefer the Winston originals over the Forbidden Forest interpretations which I find somewhat ersatz and grandiose and lacking Winston's natural simplicity."
4,Great carrier/log holder,"The carrier is great, holds enough for one long night of fires, or a few small fires. The holder is sturdy and seems to be working well so far. We've had the holder/carrier for about 3 weeks and we use it frequently. So far so good."
2,"Can we say ""disappointment""?","So. With the two bishonen on the cover, the exciting set up and the word ""gay"" repeated more than once (although unfortunately in reference to ""gay Paris"") on the back cover, I am sorry to say that my hopes were too high for this manga. For a yaoi enthusiast like myself, this story is at best, a tease. At worst, it's downright dull. I'm leaning toward the latter, unfortunately.Although the art is great (hence the second star), the story is pretty boring, that is, not enough to keep me interested without at least even a hint at yaoi. Which there pretty much isn't. So maybe if I was new to yaoi or manga in general I might have enjoyed this, but the plot line is sketchy, the characters nonexistant except for the antagonist, and no boylove to speak of!! *sigh*"
5,Chello and violin,The best of the three. Just chello and violin which brought to life the sessions with Maturin and Jack at sea.
5,Enjoyable music.,"I enjoyed the Captain's Cabin music from the Master and Commander soundtrack. This is more of that fun rollicking music, sans movie score."
1,first time,"turned out to be just like the ones we already have, looking for something that fits better, so i sent them back. nothing wrong with product alreay have same."
4,NWS,I think NWS is the best band to come out of St. Louis yet. The CD is just one or two songs short of being completely great. Somehow they just seemed magical.
2,Slightly dissapointed,"We have been trying to use this software on a new Dell XPS workstation for the purpose of creating high quality video. We upgraded from a previous Adobe version due to a bug.Despite improvements over Adobe 1 versions, the results have not been impressive. If I were starting out with new projects I would not select this software."
5,Works well,"I purchased this for my fair skinned 23 pound 1 year old. Fits him great, covers the back of the neck, ears, and provides good shade for the face. The brim is made of foam, so it floats! (bonus!) All in all, I'd purchase this again!"
4,Our dog loves this toy,"We play fetch with our dog with this toy, & he goes wild when we use it instead of just throwing a ball. After a while something goes bad, and it quits shooting the balls out more than a few feet."
3,Other NERF guns are better,"We bought 8 of these for our office, for we could all shoot nerf balls at each other.The problem being that these have a pretty loud popping noise for office use. The other issue is the slowly wear out. The o-rings and such after a month are pretty much shot. This means instead of being able to go 20 feet, you can maybe only go around 10.Other Nerf guns are more accurate with the darts, and also shoot a lot farther. The also have the benefit of being cheaper. It's a decent gun, but I'd probably look elsewhere."
2,"Bulky, Noisy, and Inefficient","I bought an earlier version of the Reactor that was pretty much the same as this one except for it had different stickers. It was pretty sturdy, and had a fairly high rate of fire for a Nerf gun (Up to 2 rds. per sec.). It's also probably one of the loudest Nerf guns out there, which can make it good for a surprise blitz attack, but not very good for a stealth hunt. The only problems I had with this gun were 1. It doesn't have a trigger (I hate guns with no triggers, the're so unrealistic), and 2. It only has a range of about 10 feet, which makes it useful for close-range indoor combat, but TERRIBLE at long-range and sniper combat. In conclusion, you would probably be better off with a NERF Crossfire or Maverick than this bulky, short-range gun."
3,Not for small children,The age range is 6yrs and up but looking at the simple shooting mechanism I bought it in hopes my 3yo daughter could use it. It's a fun toy for adults but it requires more force than a child under 6yo can provide. Too bad they don't have something similar for younger kids.
2,hard to use,I bought these for christmas bc I remembered the nerf guns from my childhood. The boys seem to have a hard time pumping these. Why do they always change the originals?
5,Excellent,This is a must buy if you are looking for a great marimba CD! Mayumi Hama does excellent job on Kaiko Abe's music. Also her Marimba spiritual is the best of all!
4,"Hey, man, nice shot!","For a debut novel, this is a pretty good attempt at writing a story where the characters are so self-involved you feel like you've met them and gossiped behind their backs. The most arrogant character of all, Kerry, was so irritating that I loved it. I like when a writer can arouse that type of reaction in me just by writing about someone. And Kerry doesn't even exist! However, the applied theory of Schrodinger's cat is a poor attempt at being poetic, and poetic McGregor is not. What I do like about her is that her writing is straight-forward and lacks the frilly detail that so many authors think makes a book worthy. I do recommend this one if you're into a slight who-dunnit concept and story-telling that is for the most part to the point."
1,Tried and made it worse.,Plan of attack in releasing anger according to to this CD is by imaging your in a room with the person responsible and letting your anger go at them - didn't work with me only made things worse.
3,Okay,I bought ths book because I really need to release a lot of anger and bitterness but I did not like her methods.
3,So so,"When I received the candy, it looked like water got into some of the bags and caused the cotton candy to harden. Otherwise, the candy wouuld've been great."
1,Poorly Made Toy - Returned Immediately,"I am a fan of Fisher-Price and their products, but the Sweet Magic Kitchen is the exception. As soon as I opened the box, it was obvious that the product was poorly made. It 's made of hard plastic that will not be able to take the abuse that even the most docile kids can dish out. The oven door is extremely flimsy and would never last more than a day or two with normal use. I returned the product and bought the Little Tikes Cookin' Sounds Gourmet Kitchen which is a superior product."
3,Sweet Magic Kitchen,"I recently purchased a Sweet Magic Kitchen and was very disappointed. I have always bought Fisher-Price, knowing that the quality would be there, but this toy was not very well made. The pieces were difficult to put together, the refrigerator door would not stay closed and was warped. The song and motor sound from the oven function was very annoying. I would NOT recommend buying this item... it was way over-priced for what it delivered. Fisher-Price needs to improve this item."
2,this product is more trouble then it is worth,this product is the worst. It took me about a month to finally locate one when we got it home the oven door does not stay on my 18 month daughter gets so angry.the fridge door falls off. Its also priced to high.
2,Not what I expected!!!,"This is a good idea, it is really fun for my 2 1/2 year old grandaughter but its not a very well made toy. For one like everyone else says the door is very flimsy and will rarely stay closed. On my grandaughter's, it doesn't change the sweets different colors until the third bake time. I love the idea but I wouldn't suggest anyone to buy it. I really hate that since she just got it this christmas!!"
3,FRUSTRATING!!,"I bought this on sale AFTER Christmas in 2003 knowing it would be a good purchase for my 3 year old daughter. She LOVES to cook and was thrilled when I FINALLY got it put together.I agree that the oven door NEVER shuts and the refrigerator door comes OFF all the time. We never could get the sounds to work.BUT since I got it 50% off, it was worth that amount of money.If you're paying full price, think again- spend a little extra and get a deluxe play kitchen."
2,Very Poorly Made - This is Fisher Price????,"I wanted to buy this for my 3 year old son soooo much. He was, and still is, completely sold on it - you show him 5 kitchens and he can pick this one out; the Magic Cake Kitchen, he calls it. After reading the reviews already posted here, I went out to see this kitchen and judge for myself. How bad can it be? Very bad! We bought the Little Tykes Gourmet Kitchen instead along with a bunch of cake play pans, etc to go with it. The reason - I took one look at this kitchen and saw how cheaply it was made. The plastic is VERY thin and brittle feeling and the oven door does feel like it will fall off with even the most gentle manueverings. $$90??? Come on!!! Shame on you Fisher Price!!! Go check out the competition. Thanks everyone who posted HONEST reviews - they helped a lot - at least I know the kitchen we bought will hold up. My son and I will continue to do lots of real baking together - that's what I call magic!"
4,The oven door doesn't close!!!,"This toy is very attractive to the eye and the idea is adorable. Many pieces to play with and very realistic (the cordless phone). I am however, very dissapointed in how long it took us to assemble. We assembled it last night, It took over 30 minutes!!! Too much time if you ask me. I haven't put batteries yet (we forgot to get them - daughter was not happy about that!), but the one thing that really annoyed me is the oven door doesn't shut. I wish I would have read all the reviews before purchasing this toy, but it doesn't seem to bother my daughter so I guess that's the most important."
2,Really depressing,"I'll try to make this short and somewhat sweet. First of all, not all TS autobiographies are worth reading just because the woman who wrote it is a TS. This is one of those books you can skip. It is poorly written and somehow manages to turn prositution into a banal subject! If you're looking for practical transition info, it's not here. Ms. Townsend's issues clearly go way beyond being TS. And, despite being brutally blunt about the seedier side of her life, the reader somehow gets the feeling that she's still not being totally candid!The big lesson here for a young TS is to avoid sex work...also, try to avoid sex work. As seen here, it is an addiction for some.This very depressing read will invoke the urge in the reader to highlight all the spelling errors."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"Very unreliable. Clumsy user interface. Couple of times I had to pull over and wait for the stupid thing to lock on the sattelites. Often needs a PDA reset. Imagine having to reset your PDA , start the program again and enter the destination again while driving in traffic."
4,Blistering,"This is an interesting contrast to the Vienne DVD. I find Vienne more musical and organic. This one is flashier. Saxophonist loves the harmonics which makes for a pretty screechy tone throughout. Bireli's playing is solid throughout, though again in contrast to the other DVD, here he seems to be trying to impress with flash and technique rather than beauty and melody. Nice to see the archtop playing as well on this release. I know this review sounds kind of negative, but notice that I am only comparing Bireli to Bireli. It still is head and shoulders above most jazz dvd's.One thought I had at the conclusion was that the track in which Bireli plays Bass is among the best. I am amazed to see a guy play that well on his SECOND instrument."
5,Way better than Old Black Rubber Flush Balls,"Since these Red Ones came out, will never go back to the old black ones. The Black would get on your hands and make the biggest mess. Why it took them so long to replace the black, don't know. Just a better grade of rubber. Try them.Order was filled promptly."
2,"Some work, some don't.","Got one for my keys, fastener worked fine. Got a second one for my wife, but fastener broke in a few days. Didn't return soon enough to get replacement or money back."
5,Ju-On White Ghost/Black Ghost,"I just watched this movie on Netflix.com and I loved it. I really liked both the White and Black Ghosts Stories, but I think the better of the two is the Black Ghost story. I definetly would tell someone who wants to see this movie it is worth the price to buy or rent. This movie gave me chills all the way to the very end."
3,"""It's all been said before""...""Over and Over"" (The Supremes)","I love Mary Wilson, Diana Ross, and all the Supremes, but how many times must their story be told? Mary has always been my favorite Supreme, but she is overweight these days and doesn't look or dress Supreme. The wigs look cheap and the dresses are way too tight for her frame. What happened to my svelte sexy Supreme? Only her voice has improved with age. Her latest CD recorded live at the Empire Plush Room in San Francisco's York Hotel is simply superb, but only Diana has maintained her Supreme girl figure (while still using way too much make-up!)...the sign of a true Diva Supreme."
3,"Same Old, same old","I bought ""The Best of Barney"" and ""The Best of Andy Griffith"" each 8 epsiode disc, and is exactly equivalent to this set except for the ftfth disc. But they also have biography included. Only thing that puzzles me, I was trying to get the episodes in color, the ones I have are B&W but the packaging says color. I wonder what about this one, is this another dummy of color that turns out to be B&W ?"
3,great music-poor mixing,"Does anyone out there care about the mixing in a mix cd? If you do then you will find that you will be disappointed in this mix. Sure the track selection is fantastic and that counts for more than anything (that's why I gave the cd 3 stars). The mixing is so undenyably poor (at points) that it takes away from the overall beauty of the mix. If we as the consumer continue to let our DJs get away with this rubbish, then in the end all we'll be left with is a bunch of commercial DJs who release crap compilations...just like any other genre in the music industry of today."
2,Compression Raito Overload,This mix by WishFM wanders around in a minimal house funk until Orbital saves the night with a smooth transition into a worthy (if obvious) trance set ending way too soon with a segue into drugged-up dialog presumably from the film. The end result is a broad but incoherent taste of the current dance sound that completely misses the point that to build a vibe you must first build a groove. To cover this much territory a DJ needs at least six hours.
5,Holly McNarland rocks!,"OK peeps listen up ok? Holly McNarland totally rocks! I heard her song ""Elmo"" for the very first time and am addicted to it! Her fierce vocals that turn ice cool rock! I recommend this CD to any one who wants to hera a 23 year old woman belt her heart out! Also check out Lilith Fair Volume 2! It rocks!"
4,"Pretty good, but not so.","This was an a-ok book, but it never really got into the theme love stories. Mostly it held a theme of football and crushes. It was more of a man's story, but it was okay since we get to know the man's point of view about his crushes. Trevor Williamson was forced by his dad to join the football team, though he was more of the intellectual guy. But for family's sake, he did get to join and he was pretty bad on the field, but the football team of his school needed the players so he was taken. He got to meet Allison, the pretty cheerleader who happens to be the girlfriend of the quarterback. And he also got to see the other side of his friend, Minnie. You better read the book yourself to understand the story and find out whom Trevor ended up falling for. Enjoy reading the book!"
3,outstandingly funny..............,"The Broken Blade by William Durbin (163pp.) is a very funny book. I liked it, because it sounds beliveable. I didn't like it, because it didn't have enough adventure. It takes place in the 1800's, and the main caracter's name is Pierre. the historical subject is the Canadian trade. I wouldn't recomend it, because its not as exciting as i'd like it to be."
4,"GIVE THIS CD A LISTEN, YOU MAY ENJOY IT!","I used to work for Camelot Music, and I was lucky enough to get a copy of this CD 6 months before its release. It's a good album. It's not exactally COUNTRY, but it's good. The highlights are ""HEART HOLD ON"" and ""IF SHE DON'T LOVE YOU""!"
2,Enough with this series already!,"I agree with a number of other reviewers that this series has stretched on way past where it should have stopped. The original Left Behind novel started off well, but it seems the length of the series was stretched by publishers who wanted to make as much money as possible and cash in on the series. I see no reason why ""The Indwelling"" and ""Assassins"" couldn't have been merged into a single book. A lot of what the authors put forward in the later books in the series is rehashed in previous books, like a television soap opera with Monday and Friday shows that mirror each other. Those still interested in reading well-written realistic scenarios of the apocalypse should read The Christ Clone Trilogy and Conquest of Paradise instead. Both those books were a lot more believable, and they didn't need twelve books to tell a good story about the Tribulation!"
2,Alternatives,"The authors have 'dragged' out the last couple of books and it's very discouraging. They should stick to their earlier trend. However, in spite of this, I am anticipating this new book and will have it in my hands the day it hits the stand. Also, for anybody iterested, The Christ Clone Trilogy series is fantastic and readers of the Left Behind series will love these three books. I had to order them special after I tripped over a old review . They were written over 10 years ago. However, I noticed in BN a few weeks ago, they have been re-released in hard back. I can't recommend them enough. Everybody I have lent them to loved them. Talk about the edge of your seat!!!!!!!"
3,better than the last book....,"but enough already. This book could have been better if it would have just been combined with the last book and had 11 books in the series, but I guess that 12 is an even number, so there you go.This book sees the original Trib Force under seige, both at their safe house and in Petra. This book has a lot of the action that the first books in the series had. If you have read any of the other reviews, you already know that there is a cliff hanger at the end, which I thought was well done. I began to see some of the characters become more human--like I knew more about them. Of course, some of them became more ""Divine""--knowing that the end was coming, they began to embrace that rather than their earthly life.Anyway, a good book that is more reminiscent of the earlier books in the series. This book will make you cry and laugh and wonder."
3,Good Series But Not Quite Up To Par.,"This series goes on and on I want closure, it is an enjoyable read...authors have 'dragged' out the last couple of books and it's very discouraging. They should stick to their earlier trend. ...I highly recommend all these books and you should read the reviews.. I can't recommend them enough. Everybody I have lent them to loved them."
2,Armageddon,"Does not meet the expectation as set-up by the previous books. Not enough dialogue on the anit-christ and the people who are being saved, poorly written last 100 pages. If the authors are trying to keep true to Revelation they have totally missed out on the interpretation of this biblical book and what truely is believed to happen in the end times."
2,Losing me,"This entire plot of this book could have been written in about 20 pages. I am finding myself not liking characters that I initially loved. In this book, the authors turn Chloe into a complete idiot who jeopardizes herself along with everyone else in the San Diego underground. Ugh."
5,Packed with excitement!,"I am an avid follower of the left behind series, I can say that this book is one of the best book i ever read. A must read, well, you have to start with book one. I can't wait for the next book (""Glorious Appearing"")."
1,That will be enough guys....,"Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Lahaye, please stop pumping out this crap. This is like a bad Michael Crichton/Clive Cussler series for southern fundie conservatives. You're making Americanized christianity into an even bigger joke than it already is.I have a Newsflash for you Left Behind fans: People of all cultures all over the world have been predicting the end of the world since the beginning, and you know what? It hasn't happened yet, nor will it happen for a long time, and it definitely isn't going to happen like this. The fate of the human race doesn't rest on Judeo-Christian beliefs anymore than it does on New Age ones. Give it up already."
5,Another non-stop read!,"Once again, an excellent portrayal based upon what we know from Scripture. I read the book within 38 hours because I just didn't want to put it down! Be prepared for some surprises. Understandably, the clarity with which the end times events are presented will inevitably cause non-Christians some discomfort."
3,Not a perfect series but better than some give it credit for,"Left Behind seems to be more of an introduction to the subject of the End Times, a series that is reaching out to all people of different ages. It's not particularly well written, but it is clear and straightforward. The characters are not particularly realistic or interesting, but these are not character studies, these are novels that are trying to give people an overview of this concept, and they do that quite well..."
2,Leave this WAY behind,"Each time a book in this series has come out lately, I have renewed hope that it will grab me. The last 50 pages or so did get me, but generally this was a disappointment. The story lines are very forced. The characters do completely illogical and irrational things and then are surprised when something goes wrong.With another 50 pages tacked on, this could have been the last book. Easily. I can't even imagine what they are going to cover in the last book! There'll be a bunch of reunions, no doubt, but not enough content to fill a 300-400 page book."
3,Looking forward to an end.,"I started reading the Left Behind series when Assassins (the 5th - or so - book) came out. The book jacket of that book sounded interesting so I went back to the beginning and read them all. I'm not a particularly religious person and some of the religious messages in the books I find seriously offensive. However, I have always been quite taken with the adventure story and with the characters of Buck, Chloe, Rayford, etc. As each successive book contains less and less storyline and more religion, I have become less and less interested. I look forward to being able to find out what happens to them in the next and (as I understand it) the last book."
5,A must-have!!!,"I bought these for my 22-month old daughter. I should have ordered these for her a long time ago, I think any baby 6 months or over would love these. They are VERY durable, heavy plastic. They are different colors with different designs on top and different shapes on the bottom. When my 22-month old got these, I thought she might be too old for them, but she loves them! She also likes to put other toys inside, etc. Toys R Us had no stackers and I had looked places, I think stackers in general are hard to find, I'm so glad I found these."
3,Careful of shattered pieces,"I was excited about this toy, as it also sparks curiosity about colors. My 3 year old noticed that stacking blue and yellow blocks appeared green, for example. The first day we got them, a book fell on one block, and I immediately had shards of plastic and colored liquid around the playroom floor. I was really worried about my kids getting hurt and we have barely played with these since. (I usually store them out of sight). Plan Toys was not responsive to my email regarding the safety and quality of these blocks. It was expensive and I'm disappointed. It is possible the shattering was a fluke, but I'd expect a toddler toy to be more durable.EDIT: I finally got in touch with someone at Plan Toys and they will be replacing the shattered block. They said this was not common for a block to shatter."
5,Good blocks,"We've had these blocks for a few months now and my two-year-old frequently chooses to play with them. They seem to be indestructible - no splintering, the rounded edges are as smooth as the day we got them, and the windows are only scratched a little. They also look quite attractive when stored on the windowsill to catch the sunlight."
3,splish splash,"my son is 2,and just received these blocks i week ago. he loves to watch the water splish splash in the block,and look through the different colors at things.they seem to be well made,and a nice size for him.they would be better if there wasnt so many half circles.(you really cant do much w/them as far as building if you dont have many blocks).a triangle or rectangle would be better.all in all,i think they were a good buy !"
1,Misleading Picture,"I did recieve a bag sealer, I did not received ""Eurosealer"". Dont get me wrong, it works ok but its NOT the one I wanted and pay for!"
2,battery only,"I had one of these before, but it plugged into an electrical outlet. It had plenty of power and I didn't have to hassle with batteries. I am dissapointed in this NEW version"
4,Handy little gadget,"I've had a Eurosealer for, oh, about five years now and use it frequently to open and reseal snack bags. I have replaced the batteries ONCE in five years. Note that the instructions that come with it say it will seal MYLAR bags only, not plastic storage bags. Mylar bags usually have a silvery look on the inside, but some are virtually clear. This gadget does need to be moved s-l-o-w-l-y across the bag, but it seals just fine. And the plastic-protected swing-out blade (like those small handheld letter openers) neatly slices open the bag. Only problem, I snapped off the plastic blade protector recently when I was too rough opening a bag. (Must have been really hungry, couldn't wait!) I can still use the blade, but have to be careful of the sharpness now. If not for that, I'd give it 5 stars."
2,"I didnt receive the ""Euro sealer"" I received the ""Smart Sealer""","Although they are identical, it wasn’t the ""euro-sealer"" which I had in the past and worked great. This product sucks the battery life after each use. It also doesn’t heat up as fast and I have to hold it together to get it hot. There is also not a metal sealer on both pads like the ""euro-sealer"" Disappointed but I guess the price is what you pay for."
2,a little diapointed,"the quality feels cheap. good gadgety item, but it works only 50% of the time. i have to try a few times before a bag can really be secured and sealed"
1,junk,"It is impossible,does not work. Don't waste your money. I have tried it on different types of bags with no luck what so ever."
1,Very disappointing.,I like Dolly Parton. I like the way she speaks her mind. I bought this CD on the basis of an NPR interview. Wish I'd never heard that spot. Avoid this CD.
2,Wouldn't Recommend,"I'm a big Enigma fan and I had high expectations for this DVD. While the ""A Posteriori"" album was itself quite good, this DVD was not. It was basically the album playing to what looked like a poor, shaky, very low-res Windows Media visualization. The (no doubt) hastily-thrown-together Cretu interview did not make it worth the price, nor did the ""photogallery"" of 6 or so Cretu close-ups, nor did the inclusion of 4 remix tracks set to slightly better-quality visualizations. I am quite disappointed, really, and I recommend spending your money elsewhere."
5,Ms. French is a good person.,"This is a great book. I met Dolores at a Mensa convention we were both speaking at. I am a member of Mensa; Dolores is not. I attended her lecture out of curiosity and then stopped for a chat afterwards. That chat turned into a friendship that lasted for most of the 12 years that I lived in Atlanta. I read this book: Working: My Life as a Prostitute, about 4 months after having met her and it is genuine. Dolores is also genuine. Don't ask her a question unless you want the straight truth as your reply. Dolores is a smart businesswoman who has led quite an interesting life. My many talks with her gave me insight into differing perspectives; many of which I wouldn't have had, had I not known her. I can honestly say that reading her book opened my eyes about many aspects of life as a woman. How men see us; even if we don't want to think that it is true. It is a MUST read for all women past the age of 16."
4,Good bargain,"Although this is not a top-of-the-line knife, it's a pretty good bargain. The blade is well made and fairly sharp from the factory. The wood handle on my knife had one minor flaw, but was finished well. The nylon scabbard is not made for quick draw. It seems sturdy, though.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase."
5,WINCHESTER BOWIE KNIFE,"For the price,this knife is of exceptional quality.The sheath is rugged and gets the job done. The handle has a good feel to it."
5,Hot Hot Song!,This is an awesome single from Janet's '20 Y.O.' album. And Khia just adds something more to it. I love it. The video on this is very hot and steamy. A definate buy on this single. Hot remixes. This is the one worth getting out of the other 'So Excited' singles. This ones the best.
2,too floppy for my tastes,I was hoping for a somewhat stiffer hat. Also it doesn't have the typical snaps that some boonies have. this hat might be suitable for someone else but for me the fabric is too thin and the hat is too floppy.
5,NEW LATIN ROCK,"Jumbo is one of the greatest new bands of latin rock, like zurdok, is a band how has power on some songs, but it also have some lite sound on others, is a combination between Oasis and Radio Head. Restaurant is one of the best album of 1999 and will be one of the greatest of all times, on latin rock."
1,Disappointing,"Most of the information in this book has been cut and paste, word for word from other authors, particularly 'The Biochemic System of Medicine' by George W. Carey. The actual amount of information available on facial diagnosis is very brief, just a few points for each salt. The pictures are confusing and don't provide detailed information about facial diagnosis. After reading this book I get the feeling that the author is no expert on the subject he is writing about, or more accurately, cutting and pasting about."
3,CHECK PART NUMBERS,"Amazon said this part was correct. It was not. Wasted time waiting for part only to find out it doesn't fit. Amazon did not have the right one.Rated 3 stars- not good not bad....didn't fit, so any other rating is unfair. But I did notice it was a Spectra Premium brand radiator inside,not a VistaPro Ready-Rad. I would hope that's a good thing."
4,UM....,"I bought this set as I was replacing bushings on my 99 S-10 Blazer..... Wish I could tell you the tool worked like a charm, BUT..... it didn't come with the adapters I needed for my Blazer.Though I didn't get to use it, I will say the tool looks and feels like its a quality tool..... just make sure it fits your car or truck first!!! LOL"
5,"Hilarious, Totally Hilarious!","This is one of the funniest shows I have seen (or heard) in years (well, maybe The Producers still ranks the best). It's everything a Broadway show should be. Huge production numbers, outstanding comedy, great satire. Just a completely well-rounded and performed show. What can you say about David Hyde-Pierce? The guy has it. He's an incredible addition to the musical theater. Debra Monk couldn't be funnier or more brazen. Karen Ziemba has been on the periphery of greatness in many shows; she final lands there. The ballads are touching. Kander and Ebb, one of the greatest composing teams in Broadway history, have writte a worthy finale to their illustrious career. This CD is a fitting tribute."
3,David Hyde Pierce does Sherlock Holmes in a musical.,"The show which spawned the OBC album was no ""Producers"", in fact it reminded me a lot of an old show ""Crazy For You"". The music was pleasant and one of the cast members has a wonderful tenor voice. Other than that the score is forgetable."
1,Its Murder,"Cornball musical without memorable songs. If you want nostalgia, as some of the reviews call it, listen to some old and far better Kandor and Ebb."
3,Shoulda been longer,"As you may have noticed, this cd dosnt have many songs. Being the second record they have released on this label (or any MAJOR label) they did ok. i mean this cd really isnt as good as the first. if you dont have the first dont worry because this is a good first cd to buy by them. it gives you a little sample of what they are like. if you love the fish and have all of their other cds dont bother because this cd only features 2 new songs unheard on the other cds."
4,"Levinas' best work, but not easy to understand","Much though I am fascinated with Levinas, I do find it nearly unreadable. His text is so dense, it requires (but definitely merits) slow reading.Although it might be helpful to have read earlier Levinas, this book takes a bit of a departure from the philosophy he espoused in his younger days. I don't believe it is such a radical departure so much as a reorientation and increased sophistication, but that's a topic for another discussion!I highly recommend this read if you are familiar with phenomenology, particulary Husserl and Heidegger, and Kant. I believe they are essential to understanding his arguments.If you are willing to put in the time and mental effort to unpack this, it is a very rewarding book. For some additional explanation, a good companion is Beyond by Peperzak."
3,Pretty Good,"This manual is pretty good, though it is not the best thing I've seen come from WOTC. The monsters were interesting (especially the Legendary Monster Template). Overall, it has been very useful to my campaign. It could be useful to you too, especially if you run higher level (10+) characters."
4,Must have if you want to add variety to your games,"I really enjoyed this manual. When 3rd edition rolled around and replaced AD&D;, I was a little disappointed with the monster manual. Although they DID get rid of some really [weak] monsters from 2nd edition, they excluded some that i really would have liked the stats for - gem dragons, banshees, etc. (Personally, i think that these creatures should have been in the first MM, but...)One thing i really like is that this manual gives you not just new creatures, but whole new races- creatures with detailed society information and many different subclasses of the particular creature. It's nice to have an entire society layed out for you, just waiting to find a place in your world.I would say that for a DM just starting out, the MM is good enough. For someone who has been running games for a while, and especially those who have PC that are higher level, MM2 is a must. It will help get more variety into your games and throw something new at your players."
4,Great CD to have in your collection,"Big Bub can SANG!!!! His voice just grabs you and won't let go. He was the stand out voice when he performed with his former group Today.I love playing this album, and it's in heavy rotation in my car and at home. He is at his best when he sings ballads. A good album, and it's a shame his career did not go further. If he released an album today, I would buy it."
4,Timeless,"I really enjoyed this cd. My favorite track is ""Zoom,"" which was a remake of the classic Commodores hit."
4,Thick and well built,"I bought this for my 2006 Chevy Trailblazer. The smaller one is just a few inches too short - as it gets used it will eventually slide out from under the sunvisors.But the jumbo one is just the right height. Except it's too wide. But that's okay - I just don't fold out the last segment on each side. Then it fits quite nicely.So if you have a GMT360/370 SUV (TB, Envoy, Saab 9-7, Isuzu something, Buick Rainer, Olds Bravada) - this is probably the better size to purchase.Sizing aside - the shade itself works well (south Florida sun really makes these a necessity), holds up well enough, stores reasonably well, and can be put up and taken down from the windshield fairly quickly."
3,Bigger than I thought,I gave the jumbo one to my husband because he has a truck but its so bulky that he sometimes don't even use it because he has no room for it in his truck.
4,"Same Great Piano, but with Different Taste","As always Di Blasio displays his consummate piano skills in De Mis Manos, yet some fans might find this CD to be somewhat different from Raul's past music. First, the songs are more Latin tuned than most of his previous releases. If you loved the likes of Barroco, Piano, Otonal, (and Solo songs), well, you will still find some of the same elements here but don't expect the exact same. Certainly, this is not a bad thing considering most of Raul's listers are Latin Americans, but I just with I could understand the words when listening to some songs. (The cd has 10 new songs and 4 of them are vocal.) Overall, this is a solid pack and yes, Raul's piano is still beatiful and vibrant. Newcomers might also find something attractive here.. I played the first song of the cd with my mom around and she asked me to repeat the track right afterward."
1,NO GOOD,"I also purchased a cinderella doll similar to belle and was very disappointed. Her arm broke off within a month or two of purchase. Unfortunately, it was off the shelves in stores and i recieved no customer service from the playmates manufacturer. (I read that same thing happened in other reviews). The doll was difficult to dress and frustrated my 4 yr old because she couldn't get it dressed fast enough to go along with the story. Overall I wish I hadn't bought this toy! Not worth the money!"
1,A Huge Disappointment,"This was the ""must have"" gift that my 6 year old daughter wanted for Christmas... after several months it was the one toy that remained on all her Christmas lists. Unfortunately it turned out to be the biggest disappointment of the holiday season. While the doll is beautiful, the interactive process is unimaginative and clumsy. Each accessory must be attached to Belle's hand, and the interaction between Belle and those pieces is elementary and simple. After playing with it twice my daughter became bored of the plain, repetitive language and now only plays with the doll using her own imagination. I think that consumers looking for a lot of interaction would be wise to look elsewhere."
2,I aint feelin it,"No disrespect to C-BO this was hella weak to me. Bo could of came tighter with this one. I thought he was going to be serving heat like till my casket drop. I still support the cat, but please come tighter next time."
1,don't by this book unless your a scsi expert,"This book is purported to be easy to read and very helpful, but only if you have worked on SCSI systems for some time. It does not show what scsi parts look like, where a terminator should go or what it looks like, or where jumpers should go. For someone like me that has worked on IBM clones for years and never ran into anything SCSI this book works great to set my coffee cup on and nothing more."
5,Incredible way to find the information your looking for,"This book is incredible! im a 3rd year law student at Vanderbuilt University. I purchased this book to help me out with a research paper and i was able to just flip through the categorized pages to find exactly what i was looking for. I wasted no time, just went to the site i knew would have the exact information i needed. It is so easy to carry around with you, and its a lot easier than having to click on a hundred links. I definetly recommend this book to anyone who doesn't want to waste time and wants to do their research quick and easy!"
5,totally enjoying this!,"some of the reviews said that you ""could"" skip this vol and go to the 2nd part of this work, vol 2. after digesting this volume i am greatly thankFUL that i have ordered both of them, as they were written as one body of work andi am now finding that i am very interested in the jane and rob ""story"" as i wasnt on my first run-thru in the 80's. perhaps now after my own ""time"" of unfolding into these ideas... (tho we all know time is NOT) lol, i have now aquired what feels to me like the perspective that was necessary for me personally to grasp what i could not have fathomed in the 80's... at all. so if your interest DOES include what was ""going on"" with jane and rob and what it must have taken from them to gestalt THIS body of work in such a cohesive and useable fashion for all those many years, THIS volume adds to that dimension in a way that (to me) none other has."
2,complicated,The Ideas in this book are those I have read before. This book states simple things in complicated manner that you feel your going in circles and it does tend to repeat itself. I don't feel the writing had a flow to it so it did not hold my interest. I love to read and been reading for years but this style of writing is draining. To each his own.
5,READ THIS BOOK ONLY IF YOU ARE CURIOUS ABOUT THE MEANING OF LIFE,"I purchased this book for my daughter as I had read all of the Seth books a few years back. For those new to Seth it would be best, although not necessary, I think, to begin with the first book, The Eternal Validity of the Soul. That book provides a backdrop to the rest of the books. Let me introduce a disclaimer here: If you consider yourself a fundamentalist Christian, Muslim, or Jew, this is NOT the book for you and you will find it does not fit into your belief system. If, however, you have a scientific frame of mind, you will find these books to be priceless. Happy reading!"
3,"Slow, Enlightening, with Imagination&#65533;","This book started out very slow for the first 3 chapters, but then I was also reading the Bible with this book to better understand the names of the people that the book was talking about.It was a little slow when it came to me using my imagination but as soon as I turned the TV off and picked up my dictionary then opened my book, my imagination took over and it was like I was there at the time of King David. But why am I reading this book ""the Bible""? I have a Bible why did Manly Hall write about the Bible? Then the more I read the better it became, the book talks about a lot of great times but it also takes you back to the organization of Masonry. It gave you an inside look at things, that to my knowledge were not to be told, but then Manly Hall know's better than I do..."
4,Almost a perfect machine.,"This portable air conditioner would work well with double hung windows. The permanent installation through the wall is not possible with the supplied part. There is no piece to cover the hole in the inside wall. There is no plan to move the drain water through the wall. The outside vent will likely allow rain water to enter the wall. If these design flaws are corrected, through the wall installation would be possible. The actual air conditioner is excellent. It does roll over carpet with difficulty."
2,Could be better,"I had used other products to deal with undearm's sweat but i didn't like the material that is used to make this one. It has 2 layers, one is an absorbent fabric and the next one it's a plastic wrap shield ( for the puporse of avoiding water marks if the first layer is soak)the thing is the fabric is not as soft so is a bit unconfortable and the plastic shield is noisy when is dry, however since I soak them fast the noise goes fast pretty quickly but even when is wet is not soft enough so it's a bit rough on the skin, and i had to change them once a day, something that i didn't have to do with other products. It's a good price for the quantity of shields but rather expend a bit more and get something more confortable.Last but not least it sticks pretty good to the clothes."
1,HATED IT!!!!!!,These pads do not work. They were not the easies to attach to the blouses and shirts and once I got them on they did not block the moisture. Very disapointed in this purchase!
1,UNHAPPY CAMPER!,"I've used the ""older"" underarm shields which are thinner and comfortable. The ultra dress shields I've just purchased are too thick and uncomfortable. They were too bulky and bunched up my clothing when applying them. I won't purchase them again!"
1,Don't bother,"Don't waste your money on this product. It's impossible to actually get the pads to stick to your clothes. And if you do actually get one to stick, you can see it through the shirt."
3,Good for heavy fabrics,"I purchased in hopes of extending my wardrobe during a three week trip to Europe. Unfortunately, the shields are too thick and wide to work for light weight or light colored fabrics. They do work nicely for business suit jackets worn over sleeveless blouses."
3,Not as good as other brands,"Not very absorbent, so moisture rolled off the shields and onto the shirt. I've purchased Hollywood ones in the past that worked perfectly."
2,did not stay in place,I found it really difficult to get the pads in just the right spot without wrinkling them. No matter if I worked a 10 hour day or just a couple hours they were always all bunched up and many times not even close to they same place as I had put them.
4,Get the job done,This product really takes care of the underarm marks. I would recommend this product to anyone that sweats alot and gets those underarm spots. This produce work GREAT!
3,Looks really nice but...,"The pot rack looks really sharp but when it came there was nothing to attach the pot rack to the ceiling or the walls. A friend suggested using plant hooks. Which does work really well. The only other issue is I have a couple heavy pots so I had to double up on the large s hooks (that hold the pot rack up). The s hooks are really long and I think I will eventually find something else to hang the pot rack from so it is not so far from the ceiling.Update: A solution that I found works - is to hang the rack horizontally using a chain, S and ceiling (plant) hooks. I still only use the one side to hang my pots from (and find a stud if possible) but I now can hang a few of my grilling utensils from the large S hooks it came with as well. Plus it still has the look I wanted for my kitchen."
2,Pot Rack,"No instructions or hardware included on how to hang pot rack. Very frustrating! Still have it sitting around, not sure how to mount it to wall..."
4,"Thanks a mint, Araminta!",Araminta Station is my favorite Jack Vance sci-fi yet! Produces many chortles! But be warned! You're going to need the sequel: Ecce and Old Earth.
5,Surprising gem,"Clear, spare dialogue and smart writing make this book enormously satisfying. Young space colonist solves complex and at times surreally funny mysteries. One of my favorites."
1,Insomnia may be the perfect cure.,"This book by Stephen King clunks along at a slow clip in the begining, but it soon goes into a slack jawed plodding crawl. I've never had to fight through one of King's books like this. Two things:1)I couldn't find a zero for this review2) If Insomnia: 2 comes out, kill me."
5,Best book I've read in a while!,"This is a great book. I loved the detail King went into. What might be considered as insignificant actually turns out to be a big clue in the story. There is some ambiguity, a lot of foreshadowing and tons of suspense. Anyone and everyone will love this book."
4,Strangely touching,"I read this book many years ago, and it's one of the few Stephen King books I never reread. It's not because I didn't like it, it's because it made me so sad at the end. This is the only Stephen King book that ever made me cry."
2,Beware de Kindle Edition!,"The book is ok, a little slow as other reviews point out. But the main problem is that the Kindle edition is full of misspellings and typos. Apparently they scan a normal book and have some OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to get the digital version, but with absolutely no quality assurance. Every one or two pages you see a ""l"" as a ""1"" or where and ""r"" is before a ""n"" (like ""concern"") you get an ""m"" (""concem""). This is annoying. It does not make the book unreadable but you would expect better. English is not my fist language but I could do a far better job correcting the book than Amazon is doing."
3,BORING !!!!!!!,"If it wasn't written by Stephen King, I would want my money back. I expect so much more from King, what a disappointment"
3,"UNFORTUNATELY, IT DIDN'T KEEP ME AWAKE","Great concept. Great characters. Great writing (as usual). But sometimes King goes off on tangents just when all I want to do is find out what happens next.... but not 13 pages later. This happens too often in ""Insomnia"". Trim the fat, Mr. King."
2,"Please, just stop","If you are reading this review and thinking about getting this book, let me tell you, just stop. Don't buy it, don't borrow it, don't rent it from the library, let it sit on the shelves in the shame it deserves. I don't know where this came from, but it needs to go back. I'm embarassed by the fact that Stephen King let this go into print for his dedicated readers to buy. I did not get Insomnia from this novel, in fact, I fell asleep trying to get through the exhaustable plot. The two main characters are frankly boring, and unrelatable to his main audience. The conclusion was rushed, the ""bad guy"" was not there long enough to be ""terrifying"" and the only real enjoyment I got from the novel was the little bald guys, yeah, even the evil one. Insomnia was disgraceful, and don't worry about reading it unless you need something to put you to sleep besides nyquil."
2,boring,"I am 20 years old and have read majority of kings novels and short stories. I have read the Dark Tower series twice and it is the best thing i have ever read. Insomnia, however is the most boring and dissappointing novel ive ever read. I am able to appreciate the connections with the DT Series but it is so unsatisfactory that i am 63 percent done on my kindle and cant even make myself finish."
5,A true masterpiece.,"This book is one of Stephen King's true masterpieces. It starts out pretty slow, but it's well worth the wait once the ball starts rolling. Very well-written, exciting, and anything but mediocre. Highly recommended. All Dark Tower fans, I cannot stress how important this book is going to be in the cycle. Read this book!!!"
4,Insomnia,"As this was the second book by Stphen King i read (the first beeing bloody, high body count and rather scary ""Desperation""). I was rathyer disappointed with this book, as i thought it would be a bloodfest, but later on my mind has grown, and a few weeks back i read it again and i thought that this was a rather exeptioanl work of art. With one of the most original plots i've ever seen (old people cutting ballon strings) he managed to twist it in to an extremely entertaining work, and putting a 70 year old man in the lead was a great twist from the usally young and healthy Heroes"
1,Long and boring,"The one and only novel of stephen king that makes me wonder why ,just why I bought it. It is really a 600 page torture....."
5,"Starts slow, but gets great!!","No matter if you are a huge fan of Stephen King or not, this book gets everyone's attention. It isn't as gory as some of his previous books, but is just as interesting. The beginning seems to be somewhat slow and you might not be able to follow all of the information the author throws at you. As long as you stick with it, all the seemingly useless information becomes the shocking pieces of the puzle that make this novel so great. This novel allows a not-so-typical reasoning to the cause of death that makes you truly wonder if Stephen King is making this stuff up or not"
3,That ending....,"Pretty good book, but the ending's not too clear...What happened to Lois? And I agree with other reviewers that say that in this book characters are well developed... I felt as much home as when I read ""The Eyes of the Dragon"", my personal favorite. And I loved the supernatural element."
4,King picks up a new style.,"Insomnia is one of the greatest stories ever told by King. However, his usual shot in the arm approach to writing a story is swapped for the seemingly gradual progression that this book follows. His characters are almost _too_ real. You find yourself growing attached to the characters the way you wouldn't in most of his other books. A triumph for King"
4,One of King's better ones...,I was fascinated at the interweaving of characters to supernatural occurences.
2,One of the few books that Stephen could done better.,The books beginning and the middle was good but at the ending I didn't like about the kamakazi situation. If you have nothing to do then just read this book.
3,Don't believe what it says on the back of the book!,"This book isn't bad, but it's not great either. The story that I read was nothing at all like the description on the back cover! I liked the characters, and I liked how Stephen King wrote about older peole, because the elderly world of whatever that town was called was pretty funny! But, I just couldn't get into the book, and I never finished. I came about 100 pages or so short. Maybe I missed out on something, and in that case, I'll go back and reread it someday, and try to stick around to the end. But not for awhile...I am finishing up The Stand, and NO BOOK CAN COMPARE! I don't know if I'll be able to read ANYTHING for awhile after reading such a fantastic book! Whoops, wrong book review! Anyway, I wouldn't recommend Insomnia unless fantasy is your thing, or you are a die-hard Stephen King fan."
3,Not the best SK book I've ever read...,"I've been reading Stephen King since I was a young teenager and I have to say this was the least favorite book of his I have ever read. While the plot itself was good (I'm not going rehash it - you can read all about plot in other reviews), there was just way too much detail for everything. It made parts of the book totally boring and unnecessary and there were times I honestly debated just putting the book down and not finishing it. I found myself wishing for the ending to just come already. I have never felt that way about any of his other books. If you're a first time SK reader skip this one and start with IT."
2,"Get off your GD soapbox, Stephen!","Please get off your soapbox and get back to great stories, Stephen King. I agree with another reviewer who said this book should be in the political section and not the fiction section for books. We love you as a story teller, Stephen, and hate it when you try to shove your political views down our throats."
1,Convoluted mess,"What starts off as a creepy, intriguing story, quickly snowballs out of proportion and into a total mess. A convoluted mythology that makes little sense and a very questionable philosophical underpinning are the biggest failures, followed by the sheer amount of words King wastes on such a primitive story. He is at his best when at his most minimal and when the dangers stem from within (The Shining), not from something this abstract and baseless."
1,Could not get through it!!,"I am sorry, I truly think that King is an extremely talented writer and a gifted human. But what was he thinking with this one? I really did try, it took me six months to get 1/2 through it and I finally gave up! Please don't waste your time on this one!!"
2,My least favorite King book.,"I could not finish. I read the first half and the epilogue. It was so boring. Too much description, ramblings, dreams, visions. The guy sees auras and things other people don't see. The epilogue explained some major events. That was somewhat interesting, but not enough to make me want to read more. One of the things I love about King is his characters. I didn't care about these characters. My favorite King books are Carrie, The Stand, and Rose Madder.The narrator Eli Wallach was painful and hard to listen to. He sounded like he had laryngitis. He has a soft, whispering, gravely voice. At times it felt like he was reading as opposed to acting. My mind kept wandering."
1,"Small book, small print",I was very disappointed when I ordered this book for my husband. Was a very small book with very small print. I returned it for a refund.Very disappointed.
3,Be Patient With This One,"In the end, ""Insomnia"" is a great read-- if you're already a fan of Stephen King, that is. This is not the place to start if you're not familiar with King's work; try ""It"" or ""Salem's Lot"" if you're new to King's world. However, if you enjoy Stephen King's dimension-hopping fantasy/sci-fi side, then be sure to add this book to your collection. Be forewarned, however, that the first 300 pages are slow going-- not unrewarding, as King puts his considerable talent for characterization to work, just very slow going. Yet, once the action kicks into high gear, you'll want to read the last 1/3 of the book in one giant gulp. As always, once Stephen King has reeled in the ol' Constant Reader, he refuses to let go.And if you are a fan of the ""Dark Tower"" books, ""Insomnia"" is required reading."
3,Out there -- even for King,"This is the 25th book by Stephen King I have read, and I have to say I was fascinated by this book. It is like nothing else King has ever written. I did not just love this book, as I did think it was unbelievable at times, but King did such a good job explaining death and creating a strange, plausible reason why people die that I did find it fascinating. The problems with this book were many --- especially the anti-climactic ""final battle"" sequence, but for die hard King fans it is worth reading. I would rank this about 19th out of the books I have read by King with The Dead Zone, The Stand, and Different Seasons being the top three. (Tommyknockers 25th)"
3,"Not one of Mr. King's better stories, but still engaging...","Even though when you read a lot of works by an author you start to anticipate where that author might go...this story was just a bit TOO predictable for my taste. I liked the main character, but his companions lacked depth. I found myself not caring what happened to any of them. It's worth a read, but definitely wait to borrow it from a friend or from the library."
2,Not what I would expect from King. . .,"I'm a fan of Stephen King, and I like most of his books, but I was really disappointed by this one. It starts out really slow, and my problem became the opposite of Ed's. . .This book was putting me to sleep. Then the book finally began to pick up the pace, but instead of finding something entertaining, I'm exposed to some magical rainbow land where you can only go if you are an imsomniac. I thought the hallucination parts were the silliest crap that King has ever come up with. King is a good author, but even good authors can write a dud every now and then"
1,Total waste of my life,"It must have taken me over a month to read this book and i read 90 percent of it and put it down and never finished it.Why? Because it sucked and it didnt go anywhere and i didnt care what happened to anybody in it. this is hands down the WORST book he ever wrote and everyone knows it. If you go in the store and pick up any Stephen King book you always see tons of great reviews on the front back and inside, this book does not have one good review written on it so that must mean something. After this book i pretty much gave up on King,I think i tried to read The Regulators and Desperation but they both were pretty uninteresting. so basically what Im saying is dont read this book."
5,Truly wonderous,"This CD will make you fall in love with music all over again. Its like putting on an old 78 from years past, sung by some young chanteuse tucked away in the recesses of a small nightclub in New York City circa 1930. The Irving Berlin songbook is perfect for Ms. Maggarts unique, lilting vocals, she can break your heart with these tunes. If you're at all interested in her, this is the album to start with. My favorite track here is 'Always', but you'll love them all."
4,Maude Sings Irving,"I first heard, and saw, Maude Maggart when I attended a performance of A Prairie Home Companion last year at the Hollywood Bowl. Loved her beautiful sound and now enjoy this CD."
5,"Schubert: String Quartets (Complete), Vol. 4","Perfect sound quality. Beautiful music. Superb interpretations but, I'm not a musician, only a music lover. You may disagree. We are all different. Sensibilities and expectations vary from person to person. Be your own judge."
2,A kid review of this book on the essence of Buddha,"It is not intersting. I would originally give it a 1 star but I like the chapter part about the author talk about the void and emptiness. It really opened up my mind, so I gave it a 2 star.However, the history about the founder of Buddhism is pretty much what you already know if you had bought other books on Buddhism. The other talk about other dimension is pretty unheard of to me.Overall, if you did not understand about what is the meaning behind the void and emptiness, buy this book. Although buying this book for that only is really not worth it. There are other book about Buddhism better than what is written by the author in this book."
4,Am I A Genius or Just Weird?,"I enjoyed this book as it delved into those quirky, wacky people we have been labeled as geniuses. The author refers back often to Telsa and this is the primary topic of his writing. But there is enough juicy info about other geniuses to delight and entertain the reader."
1,Blandness supreme,"My hopes, raised by favorable reviews, were cruelly dashed. Berg has a generic country voice, the backup band is pure vanilla, and the whole thing seems designed by a committee tasked with churning out a ""modern country"" album. No freshness or spark of originality appears in any of the lyrics or arrangements, and there's not a memorable melody to be heard. Instead, you'll find some awful rhymes, stereotypical rural characters and sentiments, and complete colored-inside-the-lines country conformity."
2,Sterling Sliver Bold Dk. Blue Cat's Eye Pendant,"I was very pleased with the Sterling Silver Dark Blue Cats Eye Slide/Pendant. I ordered for a girl for her graduation gift. Her favorite color is dark blue. Another graduate loves sky blue, so I ordered the sky blue cat's eye pendant for the other graduate. I am pleased. I ordered the second pendant today, and got a reply that it was shipped out today...."
5,Yamazaki = Quality,"I love these utensils - the quality cannot be beat. Thanks Yamazaki! These are made in Japan and are quite hefty. The satin finish is difficult to upkeep so beware with washing. This set insides a gravy ladle but it is not standard, but rather it is shaped like a wide deep spoon."
1,boooooring,"I generally find something to like about every movie, even just that 1 split-second scene. This movie making it to the mainstream market is what you can a ""racket"" - and should be COMPLETELY ILLEGAL. Someone actually suggested it to me during a great conversation about horror movies - and only now do I get his sick sense of humor. Oh, and there is no clowns, either - the movie just plain sucked!"
1,Zombies + Clowns Should Equal Amazing!,"How could someone have such a great idea and fail so miserably? Now I am not one who NEEDS a good plot to enjoy a horror movie or good acting for that matter. But there HAS to be something enjoyable about the movie, the only enjoyment I had while watching DEAD CLOWNS was making fun of every person involved in this movie. The FX were terrible, the clowns looked like any everyday schmuck wearing a Wal-Mart clown costume and a plastic ""mummified face"" mask, the acting (what little there was) was horrible, the plot (what little there was) was terribly written. Combine one good idea with a horrible follow through and you have yourself DEAD CLOWNS. I would not recommend this movie to anyone but if your curiosity gets the best of you, as it did me, rent this pathetic excuse for entertainment before buying it."
4,Sasha Is The Leading Suspect,"When Amanda goes on vacation in Atlantic City with her friend Sasha Berg, a corpse ends up in their hotel room. In this case Sasha is the leading suspect. In order to clear Sasha, Amanda has to scour the boardwalk and the casinos.I have enjoyed all of the Amanda Pepper Books. HOW I SPENT MY SUMMER VACATION was no exception."
3,A little heavy handed for my taste..,"I love the Amanda Pepper series, but I could have done without the moralizing in this installment. I love mysteries that transport you to another place for a few hours, not preach about the dangers of casinos, and the need for women to save more to avoid becoming the bag lady under the steps on the Boardwalk! Hopefully the author will get back to what she's best at...mystery minus the soapbox!"
5,Like a fine wine..........,Donny's voice gets better with age and I love hearing all the love songs from the seventies. Super soft and sexy.....very romantic music.
4,Great Stuff People and Best of Luck:),"Just received a 4-song demo tape of the band, and am really impressed. Different, they're a blend of Beatles/RadioHead/Ocean Blue/Riverside/Oasis/ Bowie, and a hint of Davey Jones on triple doses of Viagra. I have no doubt that they'll have some sort of major impact on this generation of music and generations to come:)Great stuff guys, and hope to see you out on the LA Strip, SOON!Rick -- I love LA, except for the air, water, traffic, etc."
3,Little Big Heart,"This was a good book, well writen. I did have some trouble with the jumping back and forth between the main character and time periods. But if you are a person who believes in lover ever lasting, love that may have been stopped due to a bad person and how that love finds a way back to each other then this is the book for you. For me at this time of my life it was a harder read but give it a shot as it is a good book."
3,Rating T&T season 1,Was ok. prefer the newer ones. More effort seems to have gone into the later seasons. I think the little ones are so cute.
4,Core reading,"I rather like this book, and believe it continues to have value as a primer on intelligence for both students and entry-level employees. Most interesting is the distinction that Shulsky, himself a former defense analyst, professional staffer on the Hill, and sometime Pentagon policy wonk, makes between the ""Traditional"" view of intelligence as ""silent warfare"", and the ""American"" view of intelligence as ""strategic analysis."""
4,my new favorite carry knife,"I'm very picky about the knife that I carry. Most knives I own I carry for a few weeks, I find something I don't like about them and move on to the next knife. This knife has has managed to stay my carry knife of choice and will be for the foreseeable future. First of all, I prefer knives with a serrated edge for the utility of cutting through cords, rope, or sticks. This knife carries well clipped to the inside of the pocket. I forget it is there most of the time. It is a great knife for the price. I would recommend this knife for anyone wanting a quality, comfortable knife to carry. My only complaint is that the locking button is a little small and is uncomfortable to slide to locked or to open."
3,good for light use.,this knife is a good knife for the price. I've had my knife for about a month now and it works good. I don't think this knife is good for heavy use.
3,Nothing to get excited about,"The spring assist is a long way off from the speed and power a kershaw blur opens with. The steel dulls easily, but if you have a decent sharpener you can get it right back to shaving sharp. There is a little bit more play to the blade then I like, but its not terrible. Overall its not a bad little knife, but I would reccomend the Kershaw blur instead of this knife."
2,D- for spelling and grammar...,"I spotted this book at a local major book store on the bargain rack. I was excited about it because it looked like a silly and humorous book. After getting home and delving into it, I was disappointed.It is obvious that this book is meant to be humorous, but the many spelling and grammatical mistakes really detract from the satirical prose. Being a writer/editor myself, seeing those kinds of errors makes me cringe. In addition, some of the photos don't really seem to match up completely with the locales described. Not only that, but some of the pictures are digitally enlarged beyond their original size, resulting in unattractive pixel artifacts. Not flattering.I would suggest you pass up this book. Poorly executed humor is rarely funny. There are many other praise-worthy books on ""urban studies"" - both serious and amusing."
5,Must see,"Most indy films are still ""big budget"" and still consist of campy, hoaky, trite plots. Troubadours bypasses the nonsense and gets to the grit. It's not how you you think or may even want it to turn out, leaving he viewer in a place of their own, not being told how to feel or how to interpret the film. That's filmmaking."
3,Upwards awkwardness,McLusky gently refine and expand their goofball approach to lather their final release with enough oddball appeal.
2,Very Disappointing!!!,"Very dry reading, difficult to follow..While it does bring up some very interesting facts and hypotheses, there is no cohesion. It is written in a textbook fashion, making it somewhat tedious.The Foreward by Prince Michael of Albany sheds interesting light on the Conspiracy theories and he shows a true understanding of how the People feel about Diana's death and the subsequent cover-up."
5,Superb!,"At last, someone with the courage to stand up and challenge the establishment's version of events. This is the most convincing and well written book I've read in years. Far from being the 'wacky' conspiracy theory I was expecting, this book came across as a serious and compelling investigation into what I now believe was Diana's murder. Of course, there are bound to be those hardcore 'intellectuals' and 'PhDs' who decry this book as conspiracy theory, but for me this was a superb and comvincing read - brilliant!Well done Jon King and John Beveridge!"
2,Good for research purposes,"This was purchased for research purposes on a seminary thesis paper. The Death of God theologians were neither right, nor were they credible theologians."
1,bracelet buddy,This is the cheapest product I have ever purchased. I expect it to last for 1 use. The picture makes it look expensive but it is a plastic piece of junk and is not worth the price. It might be worth $1.00 in a Dollar Store.
2,BRACELET BUDDY,"Previously wrote my review of this product. Subsequent contact with seller Iwill only state ""consider this item carefully when ordering, if it is what you desire and feel it will really meet your particular needs and desires.I do thank the seller for their consideration for contacting me, that showscharacter, and effort to please their customers."
5,works as advertised,I have one omega bracelet that is fairly stiff and impossible to put on if i am alone. This product enabled me to get the bracelet on when ever I feel like it. Great idea!
3,Not bad...could be better,"It wasn't that bad. Ok, so it was kinda slow and some of the dialouge for the resurrection scene seemed forced and purposfully dragged out, but it was still pretty decent. But not nearly as good as Assassins. I mean, let's face it, we all knew what was going to happen during Indwelling, but Assassins kept you on your toes. If they Jerry Jenkins and Tim LeHaye can get back to that kind of suspense in The Mark, then it will be exceptional. So far, this has been the lowest ranking (in my opinion) of all the books, but it's still decent. Read it if you want to keep up with the series, but don't make this the first one...start at the begining. It'll make things a lot clearer for you."
2,Very Dissapointing,"The whole book could be condensed into a 20 page booklet if you took out all the extra line spacing and chapter spacing, etc. They (the authors) need to start giving the readers more per book. I was so dissapointed I will not continue to follow the series.From a christian context point of view, there was less prayer and less Scriptures quotes. Book was full of sensationalism and marketing ploys."
3,Still Hanging In There,"I have enjoyed the Left Behind series for a couple of years now. I have received a great deal of spiritual growth in that they have lead me to study the book of Revelation. I too thought it was a little slow paced, and then rushed toward the end. I will continue to read the books, but I wish the authors would pick up the pace a bit."
4,Once again a great message for believers & unbelievers,"When I first started The Indwelling three days ago I thought, ""Uh oh, I don't think this one will have the momentum of the others."" Wrong!I'm half way through now & LaHaye & Jenkins have again come out with a winner. This series has really influenced me as a born-again Christian & I hope that it will encourage those who are agnostics or atheists to turn to the Bible for answers before they are ""Left Behind""."
2,Long wait for a disappointment,"I eagerly awaited the next installment in this series, but have to admit I was disappointed with ""The Indwelling."" Although it ""reads"" very well, the book only covers three days. The consequences of the wounds suffered by the Antichrist are either not mentioned or are not biblically accurate, something that surprised me coming from these two biblical authorities. There was the usual jetting around the world we have seen in the previous books...one wonders where DO they get the money for all the jet fuel and planes they wreck?Their new headquarters needs a better explanation. Either it has a roof with solar cells, or it doesn't. If it has been cut in half, how can a helicopter land on it? The hero, Capt. Steele, was left as a simpering, indecisive leader. How and why did this happen?I found it long on detail, but not the helpful kind. Get it and read it, but don't have high expectations."
4,Not as good as the others.,"This is not the best of the series, but it is much better than book five -Apollyon- which moved incredibly slow. I enjoy the cliff-hangers that are usually present, but Assasins doesn't leave too many (unfortunately) I would definately recommend this book just because it's in the series and you'll miss out on something if you don't read it."
3,INDWELLING IS OK.,"ASSASSINS and INDWELLING combined would have been a better read. For those who get to read one after the other are lucky. It will be easy to swallow.Anyone searching for a great spiritual thriller to read in between LaHaye novels I highly recommend, THE FIST OF GOD by A.T. Nicholas. It's phenomenal! A little deep and confusion at times, but the plot and message are incredible. The story sticks with you. Great read!"
1,sad excuse for a book,"this is by far the worst of the left behind series. Don't get me wrong, i loved the first one, but this is almost too much. It seems to me that Lahaye is just dragging the books out to make more money. The characters are all whiny, totally transparent, and they lack no depth whatsoever. This novel should have been a few chapters in the next book. Really bad writing, even the editing is bad, i found so many mistakes it was confusing at times. I would not purchase this book again, And sad to say but i think i am done with the "" Left Behind"" series."
5,One Problem? It leaves you wanting more!,"For those who have experienced the rollercoaster ride that are the first 6 books of the Left Behind series, number 7 has us on the edge of our seat with it's innumerable twists and turns. The constant feeling of impending disaster for the main characters we have followed since the beginning never leaves us alone. In fact, the greatest problem of this book, along with the whole series is that we are left wanting more, to have the next book in our posession as soon as we put down the previous one. My wife knocked off the book in one sitting where I had to take it a chapter at a time, needing to come up for air regularly from the excitement. The race to the obvious conclusion is not very fast, but infused with incitefulness, fear, danger, intrigue and ultimately frustration, for we want the next book now!"
3,A lot of dialog with little substance,I am a big fan of the series but I found this book to be somewhat repetitive and tedious. A lot of dialog without a lot of substance. If you look at it on a timeline basis the book covers only a few days. I was hoping for a little more. At this rate it will take a bunch more books to get through the 3 1/2 years left.
1,Disappointing,"Until this book, I have been riveted by this series. This book moved too slowly, and did not have much depth to the story. It only covers three days, and all of this information could have been covered in three or four chapters. The next one will have to be much better, or it will be the last one that I read in the series."
3,Momentary Lag in the Series,"I've completed the series Left Behind. Although The Indwelling is a necessary bridge into the next volume, the action in this volume seriously ""put the brakes"" on the momentum of the rest of the series. It's a must read for those wanting to keep up with the series but be prepared that it is not the page turner that you are expecting. Fear not, the momentum picks up again with the next book."
3,"Good, but not Great.","I found the book enjoyable, but not my favorite of the series. It was rather slow, and quite predictable. I do, however, highly recomend the series and anxiously await the next!"
3,Anticlimatic,"Months of wondering ""who done it"" and it would have been more interesting if the butler had commited the crime. What I found most intriguing were the last chapters in which Tsion embarks on an Astral Travel journey. A very Wiccan/Pagan practice. Being not a believer myself, I just found it ironic that the authors would include a practice which stems from a faith which they dislike intensly. While the Mark will be added to my library when it comes out in the fall, I won't be the first in line to get it."
2,a real let down,"AFTER WAITING MONTHS FOR THE INDWELLING, I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED. ONLY THE LAST FEW CHAPTERS HAD ANYTHING TO REALLY DO WITH THE TITLE. I LOVE THESE BOOKS AND CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT BUT I HOPE LAHAYE AND JENKINS ARE NOT GETTING GREEDY."
3,"Good Read, Although A Little Drawn Out","This book was very good, although not as good as the previous 6 books were. I agree with the review that these 2 authors are writing for the message and although I don't think they are trying to line their pockets, it seems like they are stretching out this story too much. I will keep reading the series because I love it, but I hope that the authors will put them out just a bit faster and with more meat to them."
1,CAN'T BELIEVE I ATE THE WHOLE THING!,"Have you ever opened a sack of junk food...potato chips, candy, etc...intending to just sample it, then come to your senses after eating the WHOLE THING and feeling pretty nauseated? Well, that pretty well sums up how I feel after finishing THE INDWELLING-LEFT BEHIND #7. Let's face it people, this series is really baaaad: bad writing, unrealistic characters, goofy coincidences, stupid dialogue, unconvincing plots, etc, etc, etc. And I'm finally leaving it behind (along with more dollars than I care to think about). I've got no one but myself to blame for my contribution to it, but (as many others have noted) it seems like this series has just turned into a real ""cash cow"" for the two authors, and they seem to be milking it for all its worth. Not very exemplary behavior for writers who consider their motivation to be spiritual."
5,WOW!,"The Indwelling is the seventh book for the Left Behind series and it is absolutely overwhelming in the excellence of the writing of this book. The authors keep you turning pages throughout the entire book. There isn't one single boring part in this book. You will not be disapointed with the continuation of Assassins. You finally find out who killed Carpathia, and what is happening with the dangerous situations the characters that watched the assassination. I eagerly wait for the next book, The Mark, coming out on Nov. 14 this year."
2,Disappointing to say the least,"Is it just me or is everyone constantly on the run in this book? I found it tedious to read with so little satisfaction as an end result. The ending was the predictable cliff hanger that was hinted at throughout the book. In fact, I found myself speed reading through some of what we've seen plenty of in past installments of this series...being chased, being caught, being chased some more...evading the pursuants..etc... I hope the rest of the series picks up speed since I am fast losing interest!"
2,What happened to the excitement?,"The Left Behind series is my absolute favorite fiction. However, I was greatly disappointed in this book. You have to read it to keep the story line going, but the end of the book is where I expected them to be by the end of the first 100 pages. Read the book because its a great series and you don't want to miss anything, but I hope the upcoming books move a little faster...."
2,Really starting to bug me . . .,"Talk about dragged out! What should have been one good book has been s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d into a whole slew of mediocre ones. When it comes to end times novels, if you prefer to read just one very good one, read THE LAST DAY (Glen Kleier, Warner books) as it is unquestionably the most impressive in this genre. It WILL make you think and raise the hairs on your neck. I've had it with these LEFT BEHIND books. I stop here."
2,Disappointing,"I could not wait, or so I thought, until the 7th in the series came out. I was, however, very disappointed. It is almost as if the authors had to get a book out just for the sake of being on schedule and this one is just a pacifier until they write a real book. The flow of the book is choppy. I only recommend reading it so that you can stay up to date and know what is going in when the movie comes out."
3,these books need to pick up the pace,"First of all, I can't believe that this book covers a span of time of less than a week. There were so many meaningless and drawn-out details in this book. What was the point of hearing about the endless logistics of the funeral? And remember how Buck and Rayford thought they saw someone who looked like Hattie at the Jerusalem gala in the last book? That still hasn't been explained. Chaim Rosenzweig FINALLY becomes a believer in this book. I was getting VERY tired of hearing everybody try to persuade him to convert, so tired of hearing the same arguments and persuasions over and over again, book after book. Tsion has some bizarre and strange ""dreams"" in this book that are just too weird, and Rayford and Albie have a seemingly pointless confrontation at the end of the book. There were a few good points in the book. The banter between David and Guy was amusing. There were some ""cliffhanger"" moments. But the pace definitely needs to pick up in the next books."
4,If she was alive today she'd be on sell out tours...,"MM was a great vocalist, no doubt. If she had lived she would have done very well as a stage act - great voice, great charisma, brilliant witty interpreter of lyrics. Funny and fun. The compilation is great but some of the material on the second cd is a little pointless and repetitive."
3,It's just ok,"I love freediving, and I love every tidbit I can find about freediving, but... This dvd wouldn't play on my PS3, I had to watch it on the computer. It was too dark and I couldn't see all of it clearly. The acting was mediocre. I've seen much better and more inspirational videos on youtube. This movie was over before it really got started. Somebody compared it to The Big Blue. No comparison. This movie fell flat. IMHO"
3,Decent movie,"I bought this DVD because I'm interested in freediving, and the choices are pretty slim for that genre. The reviews made it sound well worth the risk, but I was a little disappointed. I don't think it's up there with The Big Blue. For one thing, the movie is very short (right about an hour), so it doesn't give it much time to develop. Some of the acting is very poor, and the freediving that is shown in the ocean is very limited. There is a little bit of interesting material on the sport, but I'm not sure that it's worth owning it."
3,I done put a hole in it.,"Okay I have this vinyl chair with flames on it, I must say it is rather awesome to look at but it did tear after someone sat in it. I needed a patch kit and that is what I got. The roll of patch material was a bit of a pain since it needs to be flat to put the glue on it not to mention cutting it. I would have liked to have seen pre-cut segments that were flat so I wouldn't have gotten so much glue on my hands. It all worked out in the end and the chair is looking good but just don't try to sit in it."
1,Never received product.,"I order this on March 28th and i still have yet to receive the product (today is May 1st.)Delivery estimate: April 2, 2009 - April 7, 2009Shipping estimate for these items: March 30, 2009 - March 31, 20091 ""Arch Chemical #91903 HTH Vinyl Patch Kit""$9.19Sold by: BIC SuperstoreWhen I receive your product I will rate again.Andy"
4,A refreshing read!,"I enjoyed many things about this book, the development of characters, the story line and especially the lack of profanity. I thought North got his points across very well, without 4 letter words, and this was refreshing. I did have to remind myself that it was a work of fiction; however, so much was based on real life that I had a bit of trouble sorting events out."
4,Not bad....not bad at all.....,"This book surprised me. I expected a book with a plot thats really predictable, however this was not the case. In my humble opinion, this book bested Clancy's Red Rabbit. Not that it was detailed in its description of technologies and thick plot, but it all seemed so real when reading this book that drew me very close to finishing it the first week. I haven't exprienced this since my first novel with was the Flight of the Intruder by Stephen Coonts. Bravo... and I hope a second novel is in the works."
2,"Well written, no real information","If you're looking at a book full of bad house photos for your coffee table, this is it.If you're looking for actual usable information, this isn't it. Floor plans are haphazard and missing in one case, photographs were chosen mostly for how ""pretty"" they look instead of informative, and the writer gushes on and on about features that nobody but another recent architectural grad would care about.Not recommended."
2,"Inspired House ""did not"" inspire.",My title of this review - is my review... I thought of sending it back. Ron
5,WISDOM OUT OF A JAR,"Amazingly, these priceless scrolls have survived hundreds of years -- even the Bedouin using portions to stoke a fire. Lots of information and controversy here."
5,Extremely Enlightening from Medical and Historical Standpoin,"This book is very good. It offers methods to help one to observe health status by observing various bodily functions. Unfortunately, I have been able get more information in this approach to medicine. There are some very healthful and tasty receipes in this book also. Imani Christi's offers a very wholistic approach to health maintenance and way of living."
5,FELT IT AFTER THE FIRST LISTEN,"I felt changes after the first time I watched this cd and received the attunement, it quickly launched me to watch the other videos and get the music cd's... Prayer works... and distance Reiki healing works in the same way--Awesome!B."
3,Spend money on class then DVD,"Had read reviews and decided to give it a try. Viewed but didn't feel much except relaxed. Went to class. Big difference in ""hands on"" attunement and staring at tv screen. BIG BIG HUGE difference. Attunement in class had me rocking and I felt energy moving thru me. Almost like a trance which took effort to break.What was good about DVD is Reiki info. His books are also good resource.I have watched DVD since class, still don't get a charge. Maybe a big screen tv would help. Will say, it does help me to relax."
3,Grips arent as comfortable as I thought,These channellocks have the same great quality as other channellock products but the grips . arent all that comfortable. Stick with the dipped handles.
5,Catopoly - catnip for cat lovers,"Great fun for cat lovers and anyone. Just like Monopoly, except cat breeds replace the properties, and cat ""goings-on"" replace the draw cards. Interesting cat facts on backs of the ""deed"" cards, too. MEEOWW!"
4,Beautiful watch,"I purchased this watch as a gift for my Mom. She absolutely loved it. The shipping was fast, the product was as advertised, and the price was very good for the quality of the product."
4,Good Idea in So-so Plot.,"This story is about female wearwolf finding her world in old USA. Nadya, the heroine, traveled from Missouri to California and finally set up near Astoria. Her character besides wildness and abnormal sexual desire, is those put out from comic's hero. Kind. Brave. Everything. Description about her travel is vividly written, not too much to feed up the imagination.The plot, however, is too simple. Everything can be predicted from even in the first part of the story. The rushing in final part does not make the story interesting, instead it deprives the preasure in wandering more inside Nadya's world. The bias against her foes is also so much that it becomes comical. Nevertheless, the idea presented in this story is superb. Though the story will not linger long in memory, the understanding and appreciation of the wild gained from this book will be always remembered."
1,Don't waste your time,"This text is pretentious, poorly written, and tries to connect far too many different aspects of Russian culture. Largely inaccurate as well. Times are tight, don't waste the $$."
5,soup spoons,The spoons are just what I wanted. I couldn't buy them locally in any store. Very nice and great quality.
4,Sweet,"I like this alot, but be sure to shake the bottle to combine the solids and oil....a little goes a LONG way...I use it for face and it's really nice for the hair."
5,Review from my side of the story,Geography for me usually is very boring! but this game makes it fun fun fun! i'd rather play a game than set through a boring lecture anyday!
1,DOES NOT FIT/DIFFICULT TO RETURN,"I too ordered this carafe because the description implies it fits 1,000 series Cuisinart coffee makers. Upon receipt, I learned that it is too short and only fits specific models in the 1,000 series, but not mine. Very difficult and costly to return. Based on the other buyers who had the same problem it is very dissapointing that both Amazon and the vendor have not clarified the item description, so other buyers don't mistakenly purchase the wrong item. This is not the level of service I expect from Amazon."
1,Wrong one,Item came on time but it doesn't fit my coffee maker. I need a different model and I'm not sure how to return it!Help!
2,"INCOMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF WHICH DCC-???? CARAFE REPLACES, EXPECT TO RETURN AND GET CHARGED BY COMPANY!","This may be a scam or at the least intentional to cause a return which cost the customer $7 to restock in the original box and packaging as they requested. The replacement for the carafe I needed was at a higher price + added shipping... they could include a list of serial #'s this carafe replaces so this doesn't happen to another customer, but my guess is they won't. OH--the picture is the carafe I needed with ""DCC"" being the first part of the serial#. The carafe they sent was the shorter one."
5,AN INSPIRING AND UNFORGETTABLE MEMOIR...,"Jarron I. Tilghman's, Memoirs of the Boy Next Door, is a courageous story that represents his determination to overcome many obstacles that stood in his path in the past, as well as the ones that will face him in the future. Through the author's faith, trust and belief, Tilghman reveals to readers that there's no way possible to prosper in life without a true relationship with God.Through Tilghman's skillfully written story, that is guaranteed to warm your heart, many readers will identify with his struggles, but praise him for being a leader and a role model to many. More so, you'll laugh, cry and want to embrace THE BOY NEXT DOOR who represents the kind of youngman our society searches for more and more each day. My hat goes off to Mr. Tilghman for sharing such a magnificent story that makes me proud of him now, as well as in the future. Certainly, this is one title you'll unquestionably want to add to your unforgettable book collection."
3,An Ok Solution,"I stripped some threads on a mountain bike bottle cage boss. Instead of drilling it out and rethreading it I tried to use this to fix it. While this worked out I really do not feel like it did exactly what I wanted it to do. The bottle cage has been secure and has not come loose in over 6 months of riding on rough trails, but I think I could have achieved the same result by gluing the screw into the boss.Bottom line: it works, but it's probably not the best solution."
4,Great looking product!,"I was very pleased with both the design and construction of this product. There are enough hooks for all of my pots and pans and the shelf above is holding all the lids. It was easy to install, the brackets are actually 16"" on center so I was able to use the studs (not all products have this dimension). I have purchased the bronze finish and it is a dark bronze.I recomend it for those who need to get more room in their cabinets."
3,Did not like it..,"Un Jibaro cantando con orquesta en vez de cuatro, guiro yo maracas. No way... No me gusto para nada."
4,Reiki II Attunement video,The video was great - you can watch is again for re-attunement or use it as a teaching aid for yourself or someone who wants to self-study. It is just as effective as getting attuned in person and doesn't take very long.
2,Umm...(sequel to umm 1),"Level 2 - I still don't feel any different. My reiki is still ordinary, and my Pranic Healing is still getting better and better. I still think it comes from within (or without, maybe it's Karmic). But still a disappointment not seeing Steve doing the symbols on the screen. Maybe that's a conscious motivator."
1,"Shoddy construction, plastic cap would not pop","I bought this because Amazon gave it a 4 star review. It's a really cheaply made item. I can't pop the plastic SDHC cover without a tool because the plastic cover is so tightly snapped on the reader. It's really frustrating trying to put the card in and out. If they had used a higher quality plastic that does not WARP in time then they could have mitigated the problem. Overall, a very badly designed reader. Also it's quite bulky compared to its competitors. I thought Kingston products were superb. I'm going back to Sandisk again. Even though Sandisk is 20-30% more expensive, at least their product is 100% more usable.Update: the reader is dead. It can't read anything now. The computer fails to even register what's inside. Crappy design. I'm never buying anything in this product line anymore. Kingston, you're a disappointment."
1,Awful Mobilite,"I bought this from Amazon at amazon.com for $10.98. If you plug it in without any cards, Windows XP recognizes three disks. If you insert a card after mobilite is plugged in, windows explorer freezes.I tried also, inserting the card before plugging mobilite in, and then explorer does not recognize the three disks.I tried different computers, different operating systems such as Linux and Vista, and same thing.This is a ripoff."
4,Useful device,"Does what it is meant to do however if you happen to close the top flap with an SD card inside it is hard to open without nearly ripping the card from the plastic eject shield so case in point, don't close the flap with the card inside. Not sure how long it will last, my last card reader from Kingston died within 3 months, but I got it for free from a special offer on Amazon, so I guess it was meant to be. This was the only reader I could find at the time that supported SDHC."
1,No QC?,"Maybe some sort of quality control issue... the one I received is able to read but unable to write. It wasn't a problem with the SD card or write switch - the SDs I have work perfectly with other reader/writers.I don't know how this passed QC - maybe there is no QC process at Kingston. Had to immediately get an RMA to replace, no complaints from Kingston. Just a guess but I bet this happens frequently. Practically not worth the shipping cost to replace.As for the actual design, it's a nice idea (physically protects the SD card) but a bit bulky in size. The included strap is hard to attach and gets in the way of the cap once installed."
2,Sometimes...,"Sometimes I can get this thing to work, sometimes, not. It appears that the connectors do not line up properly with the cards (I tried SD and Micro-both also made by Kingston) and I have to wiggle the cards around until the green light comes on. Once I can get everything lined up, it works fine, but fiddling with it for 15-20 min is not really worth it. Maybe I just got a dud. Too bad, because it is a neat design with good potential."
3,Instant Immersion Japanese workbook,"This workbook is a great reference for any Japanese learner, or just a tourist. The reason I say this is because it uses no kana or kanji(japanese characters) whatsoever. If you already know hiragana and katakana and some basic particle usage, this is an okay book to get. If you are planning on staying in Japan for a long period of time, or even moving there, DO NOT GET THIS BOOK, because you will have to learn the language all over again memorising the characters as you go."
5,Fresh Fruit Harvester,"The Ames True Temper 2324500 Fresh Fruit Harvester with 10 Foot Telescoping Aluminum Handle will work as advertised for the safe removal and picking of fruits from trees. I purchased this model for removing apples in our small orchard. The design enables you to encompass the fruit, remove it safely from its branch allowing it to drop into its basket. The Harvester will remove the fruit and protect the fruit at the same time."
1,Fell apart. My son pulls out screws.,"We chose this highchair because of the size and style. I loved that it dd not take up so much space in my small apartment and I liked the wood look better than the plastic options. The problems with it are: The plastic tray is very difficult to remove. The screws become loose after about 2 months, depending on how squirmy your child is. My 20 month son only sits in it for meal time and it has totally fallen apart on us. The screws fall out leaving the highchair unsafe. My son has even pulled out som of the screws on his own. We wasted our money on this and now we are going to have to buy another high chair as I have a second on the way and I want a safer, more conveniant option. I hope nobody else has to waste their money and energy on this product."
2,Not worth the money.,"I bought this tray for my daughter when she was four months old and for the first few months it was fine. Now that she is 15 months, she has completely outgrown the highchair. The tray is way too small and she is constantly knocking her cup off while eating meals. It's also really difficult to clean because the plastic tray doesn't easily come off. I am extremely envious of my mother's inexpensive Graco high chair that has a large tray and a comfortable chair. I will be replacing it."
3,OK book,"She tells the reader what many of us already know. There is some detail about food additives that some folks may not know. However, it is good reading for the average U.S. and U.K. consumer, who seems to be willingly ignorant. If everyone adopted her advice about food and avoiding synthetic chemicals in daily life (where you have control of them), there would be fewer birth defects and messed up children. There is an epidemic of ""special education"" children that is costing us $$$$$ as taxpayers."
3,Comfy but short,"Socks are very comfortable. Seem to be well constructed and should last. These are definitely NOT over the calf. I'm only 5-11 and they do NOT go over my calf and consequently will not stay up for more than a couple hours of walking. I'm going back to Gold Toe. Just as comfy, reach the top of my calf, stands up to wear and about 1/2 the price."
1,Broken clock,"My husband opened the clock on Christmas morning, only to find that the alarm part of the clock did not work. You could set to alarm, no mater what time you set it for it would just start alarming and would not stop. So I guess you could say I was quite dissatisfied with my purchase!"
5,Roar of the track,I am very please with this alarm clock. I bought it for my husband who drag races and he loves it. It is very loud and sounds just like a car doing a burn out and making a pass down the track. Love it!
5,Superb baskets,"This is really a very nice basket, far better than several other types I've previously purchased, including rattan. Just measure the sizes and if that suit your need, go ahead and buy it. As others have pointed out, they're foldable as flat as a paperboard. They're sturdy and very nice looking, too.am very pleased with the purchase."
3,disappointed,"I must confess that after looking forward to receiving Marty's first CD, I was hoping to hear the Marty Casey I loved to listen to on the show RockStar. But it turns out it is not so. It is hard rock, and Marty still screams quite a bit. I liked the version of Trees that aired on TV much better. I hope his next CD has a bit more pop, less screams and is more mainstream."
4,Good CD,Not a waste of money if you enjoyed Marty on Rockstar or were into the lovehammers. A good mix of thier old and new stuff and a genuine rock sound. you won't be dissappointed.
2,Everything you always wanted to know about whole foods but were afraid to ask,"I'm not a hardcore vegatarian but, I like vegtables just fine. Still this book was not as nearly as good as I was expecting. I have to drive an hour to a speciality organic grocery store to get anything for recipes in this cook book and still I'll only find about half the ingredients. The recipes do take alot of time. Time isn't really an issue for me when it comes to cooking but, ingredients that are impossible to find are. Unless you live in a major city like New York or L.A. just forget about his book. I'ld suggest ""Vegitarian Cooking for Everyone"" it's a bit more expensive but, well worth the money and most ingredients can be found at any grocery store."
5,I really love this book!,Christina is so great at what she does when it comes to cooking with whole foods. Her recipes in this book are easy and you can find the ingredients in any Whole Foods market. She really explains why it's so important to eat the right foods and why organic cooking is so much healthier. This book is wonderful.
4,What a good book.,"I read this book when I was only nine, and it was the first book that I got hooked into. It is a pure classic fantasy book for children."
3,Good book,"I can across Rick Riordan when i was picking a book for my kids, we started with Lost Hero, which kids absolutely loved, and i enjoyed very much. about 1/3 in the book we discovered that it's actually a follow up series to Percy Jackson, and that's how i picked up The Lightning Thief. My 11 year old loved this book, my 9 year old found it a bit boring, as for myself, it's a bit slow paste, but non the less really good book, with great references to Greek Methodologies. I would highly recommend it for kids 11 and up, maybe not all of the adults would enjoy it that much."
4,Great Artwork,"The Lightning Thief in a graphic novel? Who would have thought of that? ButPercy Jackson did it again! Rick Riordan's graphic Novel of Percy Jackson and the Lightning thief is a one to buy. The artwork is amazing, the story flows, and its everything I thought it would be! But there is one little snag. They leave out little parts of the story or don't put in a lot of detail. But what else are you supposed to expect from a comic? If you are a Percy fan: get it."
4,The Powers of all Gods,"I have to give credit to Rick Riordan. He really know how to put the gods together, underone smashing roof.The story is put together nicely with all the Greek Gods, hitting head to head under a false conspiracy that Poseidon's (Sea God) son Percy Jackson, stole the lightning boltfrom Zeus (Thunder God). News spread like wild fire. Other Greek Gods were not happy. Camp half-blood, it community, and demons are running in a panic, hoping for the thunder bolt to be returnedsafely to it rightful owner, Zeus.I Enjoyed reading this exciting tale. The movie was also good, however, the book provides more information,and focuses and defines on each of the characters and places."
2,This book was good for the most part...,"I personally thought that Riordan tried too hard to create the laughs found in every chapter,title, and page. I think Riordan had the right idea but in my personal opinion a few changes need to be made... I like the way he joined mythology with the modern world but thought that the flurry my friends made over the book was pointless."
4,Great book.,"Although it seemed to start out a bit slow, the book became a lot more better as I read through. A very interesting read, and highly reccommended."
4,Awesome,I think kids of all ages will love this book it's awesome All the books Rick writes are awesome kids have to read this book
4,Don't Stop Reading my Review,"Don't Stop Reading my Review!Are you looking for a book that will capture your attention? Then I highly recommend the book, The Lightning Thief. In this book, Percy Jackson is offered a quest to save the world from a huge war of the gods. Along the way Percy finds out what matters the most.First and foremost, you should read this book because it can help you visualize what's going on. In this book, there was this hairy thing with horns and cruel black eyes. That helped me visualize what that thing was. Second of all, you should read this book because it can help you make connections. In this book it said how Percy ruined a bus. I made the connection to the movie, I Am Number 4. Lastly, you should read this book because it will make you crack up all day and night. In this book, Nancy Bobofit threw a sandwich at this boy.So if you want a page turning book, get The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan. Trust me. If you get this awesome book, you won't stop reading."
3,Harry Potter meets Ancient Greece,"It's like Harry Potter meets Ancient Greece with a mix of Bruce Coville's ""My Teacher is an Alien."" It was entertaining, if not a little immature, but the part that was most touching to me was why Rick wrote these stories. His son loved Greek Mythology and when Rick ran out of stories, he made them up. He created Percy Jackson off the top of his head and Percy had ADHD and dyslexia like his son did at that time. The author was showing his son how someone became a hero with the same problems he had and, in an indirect way, that he was special. Loved it even as an adult and I learned some Greek Mythology along the way."
5,The Lightening Thief,"I am reading this book aloud to a group of gifted 4th and 5th graders and they love it. We have just completed a mythology unit and this compliments their academic achievements wonderfully. I strongly recommend this book, particularly on a summer book list for students with some background in mythology."
4,Percy - Son of Poseidon,"This book is GREAT! Percy (son of Poseidon) starts on his own adventure with his friends Annabeth and Grover.After being kicked out of six boarding schools, Percy goes to summer camp. On the way there, his mom dies. His new camp (Camp Halfblood) sends him on a quest with his friends. They meet monsters and gods on their quest to find: The Lightning Thief.Two thumbs up to Rick Riordan."
4,Great Fantasy for a 12 year old,"In a new world fantasy style series, Rick Riordan draws in his readers with lots of humor, suspense and details in this lengthy first book in the series of Percy Jackson and the Olympians entitled The Lightening Thief. We are introduced to Percy Jackson, who is a 12 year old dyslexic kid with ADHD. He has been kicked out of many schools, and most recently after vaporizing his math teacher. After his mother is killed by a minotaur (half man half bull), he finds out he is a demigod when he enters Camp Halfblood. He befriends a satyr (half goat half boy) and a girl who is also a demigod. Together they set out to bring back to Zeus a treasured lightening bolt, which holds the power to keep peace in the world. Readers will find this a page turner, will relate with the charming characters and will be compelled to read the further series.-MSM"
5,GO PERCY!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the best book ever. Rick Riordan is awesome.The chapters' names were funny. One of them are Grover unexpectedly loses his pants. That's a funny name. If you like these book you should read the Eragon books. If you go read Eragon, don't just read the first 5 chapters and say ohh the book is soo boring. OKAY?!?!?!?!?"
3,I preferred The Red Pyramid,"Percy Jackson has ADHD, dyslexia and a knack for finding trouble. He sees things no one else sees--like ladies who turn into bats and pens that turn into swords. And then he finds out he might be the son of a Greek god and monsters of the Underworld are after him--well at least that explains a math teacher that turned into a bat.The Lightning Thief is an interested story (though I preferred The Red Pyramid). I liked that Percy prefers to do his own thing--which sometimes gets him in trouble but also helps him survive. Christians may be bothered by prayers to the gods and burnt offerings.I would recommend this to older middle grade readers or the young adult crowd."
5,The Lightning Theif,"I just finished up the first book in the Percy Jackson Series, The Lightning Thief. I have heard nothing but great things about this book and I would have to say that it didn't disappoint.There were a few things I loved about this book. The first one being the style in which it was written. I love that it was a first person point of view. You were hearing directly from Percy throughout the whole book. I love when authors do that. The other thing that I loved was all of the background and references to the mythological gods. It was great to have that since I'm not exactly an expert in that field and would have had a hard time following along if there had not been the background on them.Overall, I would give this book a 5/5. It was a page turner that had plenty of drama and suspense to keep me up into the wee hours of the morning reading it. To be honest, I haven't gotten into a book as much as I did this one in a long time. It was refreshing and I can't wait to read the next one."
5,The Lightning Thief,"When Percy Jackson realizes he's a half-blood--the offspring of his human mother and a Greek God--the entertainment begins. Percy and his closest companions, a girl half-blood named Annabeth and a satyr named Grover set off on a quest to retrieve Zeus' missing bolt. As the clock ticks down to their deadline on the Winter Solstice, the three friends need to use all their courage and wits to conclude the hunt. In this first book of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, author Rick Riordan creates a wonderful combination of thrills, mystery, and humor. Mix it up with Greek Mythology and you've got a combination to please parents, librarians, teachers and kids!--Reviewed by Michelle Delisle"
1,Harry Potter is way better!,"You are probably going to think this is a useless review, becuase I never read Percy Jackson. My friend kept pushing me to read it, but I refused. She kept telling me it was better than Harry Potter. My response was ""Nothing is better than Harry Potter!"" I still think it is the worst series in the world even though I never read it. I still haven't read it 3 years later. Always remember nothing can defeat Harry Potter."
3,An Action Paked Fun Read!,Percy Jackson has always been a little bit different. From having ADHD and dyslexia to seeing strange things. So when his math teacher grows wings and comes after him he thought it was all probably his imagination. He was wrong....What a fun kick off to a series. I really didn't know what to expect from the book other than it was worthy of a movie. I was pleasantly surprised! The story moves along quickly and there's never a dull moment. The Greek mythology was very fun for me. Mythology is something I have always been interested in so that was a added bonus to for me.From the very first page I loved Percy's dry sarcastic humor. He definitely didn't feel like a 12 year old but maybe that's just me. All the characters brought something different to the story. They were all very well written and just generally fun.Overall The Lightning Thief was a action packed trill ride of a middle grade book. Rick Riordan has created a world not to be missed.
3,Harry Potter meets Lord of the Rings meets Mt Olympus,"I listened to this book on tape whilst doing a 540 mile bike ride through the mountains. As 90% of my focus was dedicated to not dying, this book was perfect for the remaining 10%. Light, creative, fun and moved along at a nice clip. My only complaint was that it was a little formulaic. A trio of friends embarks on a quest equipped with magical weapons and faced with a horde of bad guys that pop up when you most expect it.The only part I found to be strange is the author decides to characterize the son of Poseidon as ADHD and dyslexic. I suppose he was trying to make the story meaningful to today's youth, but if you're going to go that route, why not just round out the character with a super human prescription for Ritalin?"
1,DUMB AND DUMMERERERER,Are there any good book in this entire world? People say me I should read more but when I do the books are so dumb and written by total idiots. How many idiots can there be i ask and then I read this book and find there are many more than anybody can count. this book is so dumb. The kid is a god and what he just forgot that he was and his name is just like that god he is like? I don't get it. Idiots! If you believe this book you are idiot and should puke on yourself. and i see there are many more books just like it and it will never stop. dumb idiots!
5,Love it!,"Love his books all of them are action packed and easy to follow. Recommend for all ages that are into Greek Mythology, adventure, and imagination."
3,OK but nothing special,"I can see the alure of this book to those who haven't read much, but there's really nothing special here. Percy Jackson is a remade Hercules, and well, the Greek gods are the Greek gods as they've been told about countless times before. I thought it was ok over all, good enough to continue to the next one, but not good enough to get excited about. My 11 year old still is working his way through it (since June because in his words its dull, dull, dull). Normally he finishes a book in a few days - that says a lot more about the book than anything I can say."
3,Worth Reading,I usually never watch the movie before I read the book but in this case I did. I love the story behind the book about the author's son who has dyslexia and ADHD. I wish I would have read the book first. I think it is completely different. I prefer the way the story was told in the movie rather than the book. I still think this book has a great story line so I will continue to read the series.
3,Solid Book for Young Readers,"I'm NOT going to compare this to another well-known magical children's series. I read a lot of serial science fiction and fantasy by many writers. Many of these titles are meant to be read by people of many ages. This book is really for children. Really, really. Adults like me may find the novel predictable and the writing shoddy. I don't know if they writing is really poor or, because it's written from the point of view of a 12 year old boy, the simple dialect is the main character's voice.This book is written like an entertaining ancient history lesson for children. I think I'm not the proper audience for this book."
5,Simply fun- Learned a ton about the Greeks,"I was blissfully surprised at the smirky humor and learning value of the book. I think unlike many children's books, this allows the reader to enjoy a story while learning Greek mythology. It was very easy to understand the Gods and myths when in this format (easier than the actual myths which I find confusing, although not near as confusing after reading this). It was fun to read and I would recommend it to anyone- from my best friend's daughter to my own grandmother. I plan to read them all."
3,A quick read - good for kids,"I purchased this for my son for his Sophomore Honors English class; he was required to read a ""young adult"" book to review and give a talk on it. He thought it was ""lame,"" and he had to push himself to finish it. It seemed too much like a ""rip-off"" of the Harry Potter books.I'm 54 and I agree, to a certain extent. I finished it it quickly. Riordan's writing is not as polished as some other authors I have read, but as a children's book (note I didn't say young adult) it is great. Perfect for 5th & 6th graders. I chuckled all the way through at the Harry Potter parallels, but the writing is not as engaging as Rowling's. I am, and always have been, an aficionado of Greek mythology, and I have to admit that Riordan's twists on some of the gods and characters of old were very amusing."
4,Lightning It Is,"This series was recommended by my pastor! So, of course, I had to read them. Book 1 was very entertaining and I recommended to my 10 y/o and 8 7/o grandsons. Older was already on Book 4 and younger started immediately. We had to see the movie over spring break and all thought the book was better. Enjoy the god relationships."
5,Amazing,Goodness I loved this book app much I was like I was actually on the story Everyone should read this book
5,7 year old review,"The Lightning Thief is great even for people who are just learning to read. Even though it's the first book in the series, it's definitely the best!"
5,better than book two,after i read this book i got the sea of monsters. i love this one better. i think its because you are just learning who percy is and his first summer at camp half blood but there are much better situations in this book. MANY SURPISES
5,AMAZING BOOK,This book was really good and I read it in only 2 days! AMAZING BOOK. GO Percy Jackson YOU GO!!!!!!!
5,I LOVE IT,"The lightning thief is one of the best books I have ever read. And trust me, I am a very picky person."
3,Good for Kids,"If you know little about mythology you won't learn any of it here,It was fun trying to see through the various traps and guess what myth was behind them"
4,Useful and unobtrusive,This is my second unit for myself (I got it for my second home) and it works very well. When done I just place it on the refrigerator side wall saving countertop real state and not having to store it in a drawer is always handy when needed
2,"Garbage sharpener, great magnet","This is a nice fridge magnet to hold pieces of paper on your refridgerator. Not so much to sharpen knives, it's hard to get the right angle to make a keen edge, and isn't a very well-built tool.I just got the Presto brand electric sharpener, and for only twice the price of this hunk of plastic, it does an AWESOME job. Look for that instead."
5,Groundbreaking study,"This was as comprehensive a study as I can imagine possible on how New York City, under the guise of urban renewal, allowed certain poor areas of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan in the 1970's and 1980's to burn down, displacing huge numbers of people, and resulting in the spread of TB, and AIDS throughout New York City, the surrounding areas, and beyond."
4,Nice mix of religious & non-religious country tunes,"Though this is nominally a ""Christian"" album, Terri does not beat you over the head with her faith. ""Mama Prays"" is the only explicitly spiritual song on the first half of the album. The other two big ""Gospel"" numbers - the 23rd Psalm-inspired ""Beside Still Waters"", and the anthem-like ""The One on the White Horse"" - are saved for the album's close, and they close it out impressively. In between, Terri offers a hearty helping of alternately heart-warming (""A Little Time To Grow"") and heart-tugging (the title track, ""My Pearls"") songs, plus a couple (the album opener ""Oklahoma Front Porch Band"", plus ""Red Ropers"") that are just plain fun. My main complaint is ""Just Married"", which is a bit too sappy for my taste. Otherwise, though this album is not top-flight, it certainly has much to recommend it."
3,Doesn't live up to the brand,The quality of the gloves was very good - durable leather and the standard Burberry print but the gloves were not as feminine as I had hoped. They look a bit like work gloves.
4,It's fun n educational,Don't like the inside case....very unstable n the finish of the toys r not that high quality but overall it is fun n education for kids to play with...
3,"Decent show, but not what we've come to expect from PRIDE (No Spoilers)","PRIDE 27: InfernoFight Card:Igor Vovchanchyn vs. Dan BobishCory Peterson vs. Sergei KharitonovAlexander Otsuka vs. Murilo ""Ninja"" RuaKazuhiro Nakamura vs. Dos Caras Jr.Mark Kerr vs. Yoshihisa YamamotoGan McGee vs. Heath HerringRon ""H20"" Waterman vs. Mirko ""CroCop"" FilipovicAs you can see, not a thrilling fight card, but worth adding to your collection for PRIDE lovers."
3,Good,"Mandy has a good voice, but I think we like her better as an actress. The songs are nice, but nothing stands out."
4,Who knew??,"Look, I've never done one of these before, but I just wanted to say that this album is far better than anyone had any idea it could be... there are several tracks here that will easily gain entry on your Ipod and not leave...Her early stuff was.. well, we know what it was... but this is really a pleasant surprise... if you like Colvin, MacLachlan etc.. give it a try...really good effort by Ms. Moore...[...]"
5,Excellent Collection of Short Stories,"I was surprised at how relevant the stories were to the current times. Despite being written between 1915 and the early 1920's, workers ( and employers ) were faced with problems of sexual harrasment, boredom, stealing employees, and office politics.Definately, you can detect parts of Babbit in many of the characters in the book.All of the stories were worth reading. Some are amusing, some sad, and a few happy. All of them, however are thought provoking.Overall, a great book to get a hold of, especially if you are a Sinclair Lewis fan."
4,Nothing you've ever heard before...,"...unless you were one of the thousands downloading and sharing Dispatch without knowing who they were.This album contains some gems. Notably, with the western world so involved in so much conflict, the song ""The General"" seems like a pleasant fantasy- a general who realizes that the soldiers on the other side are just regular guys with regular lives, so he sends all of his soldiers home. ""Two Coins"", ""Out Loud"" and ""Bang Bang"" also aren't without their charm. There are some songs that are... less good, but the album is very good overall. Think accoustic funk- like 311 meets Bob Dylan."
2,Not That great,This was just a big disappointment. I would rather watch someone play the video game.When I heard they were coming out with this movie I was pretty excited. Then I saw the preview and was even disappointed then. I had no intentions of seeing the movie but it played on a flight that I was on twice and I decided I would give it a chance. It just reminded me of a B rated movie. Although I did like the ending just the rest of the movie was terrible. Thanks for reading.
3,Action and Adventure Abound,"Prince of Persia, The Sands of Time was a classic summer movie full of action and adventure. The actors were good looking, the special effects decent, and the story entertaining. While not destined to become a classic, I found this to be the perfect movie to kick off summer 2010, or occupy a couple hours of time when the opportunity presents itself."
3,Realistic Expectations,"As long as you're aware that you're watching a video game-turned-movie, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Jake Gyllenhaal will never be mistaken for a Persian, but he does just fine in this run-of-the-mill action flick."
2,Disappointing,"What was once a great video game has been turned into a big money special effect movie. Unfortunately the movie falls flat and gets boring fast. I'm into action movies, but it's got to have a good story too, which this does not."
2,Weak,I have liked most of the stuff Jake is in but this was not very good. Predictably enough it was like watching a video game. It wasn't too hard to look at the princess for the duration though. Without her to distract me the movie would have been downright painful.
5,arabian nights,"The movie is like watching an updated version of the book Arabian Nights. Full of adventure, bad guys, and magic. A great watch."
5,review meter,"This Movie is very good. Lots of action,suspense,mystery,etc.#1 movie to have in your home.I`am glad that I purchase it."
5,Great movie!,Watch this all of the time with my grandkids and we love it! Pair it up with The Sorcerer's Apprentice and we have a great movie night.
5,Great Movie,We love this movie. We went out of our way to find this and buy it. The story is great and the acting was done well. This is an excellent move for those who love action and a story. We love movies where the characters are better because of their experiences and this story shares that.
2,How could this be so boring?,"So many things I wanted to like. It looked like a wonderful adventure movie. But it was so boring. Hardly any adventure. All the actors can do better. AUGH! However, quite a beautiful movie. But, if you like these arabic/persian movies, stick to classics like Thief of Bagdad or Disney's Aladdin or 7th Voyage of Sinbad. Sorry to mention those great movies in this review but you need an alternative!!"
5,A Trip Everyone Should Take,"W. T. Pfefferle went around the country talking to other writers. He asked them several questions, especially ""How has place influenced your poetry?"" The answers are amazing. The poets include Denise Duhamel, Mark Wunderlich, Beth Ann Fennelly, and a number of the new ""breed."" And several established poets like Pulitzer Prize winners Rita Dove and Mark Strand.Photos of poets fill out the book and poems by several of the authors."
4,interviews with many poets on role of place in their work,"Asking variations on the basic question of what role place has in the poetry of more than 45 contemporary America poets, Pfefferle elicits a rich and revealing variety of responses. Many of the responses angle into the explicit and implicit influences of the region a particular poet is from, such as Florida, the South in general, or New England. Some poets who have moved to one or more different places reflect on changes in impressions and attachments to place. Nikki Giovanni, Peter Cooley, Mark Strand, and Charles Wright are among the poets whose names will be recognized by many. There's snapshots of some of the poets, or a photo of a local scene. And many of the numerous poets supply a poem illustrating what they have to say about the role of place in their work."
2,No Arch,"Product is good for heels, but returned this product to get the kind with the soft heel and the arch.. and was cheaper."
5,Worked better than I expected.,I was pretty skeptical about this product considering I had tried a couple others with no success. This one worked immediately and I felt relief within a few days. I just ordered another pair.
2,shoe size,"What is shown as ""M"", assumed to be ""medium width"", is any thing but. It is extremely narrow and uncomfortable."
5,Buy this one.,A moc that is true to size with a rich finish. Very comfortable with with great support. Appropriate for country club casual wear.
3,Decent shoe,"First off, these run a little long. I ordered 11M and exchanged them for 10.5M. Secondly, they start out a little snug, but thankfully, because they are mocs, they do eventually stretch out. I used a stretching solution to help that along. Once that's done, and you've worn them 3-4 times, they fit like a glove. But it takes some doing, out-of-the-box. The first time my wife saw them on my feet she commented on how good they looks. So chalk one up to looks.My last pair of mocs lasted me 15 years, and looked good the whole time. They were made by Polo, and fit great with no coaxing. Can't find 'em anymore. I got pretty attached to them as knock-arounds. I'm hoping I get as attached to these Sebagos."
5,Great shoe,"This pair is replacing a 15 yr old pair of the same shoe, they are without a doubt the best shoe of this style made. Can't go wrong with sebago."
1,Width Problems!,Beautiful shoes.Well made and good lookers. They are just to narrow and they misrepresent the size width! They offer a 11 EE and this is what I ordered. however they ship 11W which is way to narrow even with the shoe untied you will run over the sides if you have a wide foot. It upsets me that they do this and cost them $ when customers keep returning due to this problem. I was not smart enough to believe others that had this same problem. (check other reviews) My bad but I was hoping they would fit. Take mt advise Don't order if you have a wide foot!john C
4,The Infinity Edition,I got this buzz lightyear toy years ago and today his whole helmet is missing and the space firing disk was put away.I am trying to find his whole helmet in my toybox to put it back on so it will be good as new and 2 stickers came off buzz but the other two stickers are still intact and his wrist communicater is not working in other words he is in clean condition and my dad has to replace the batteries.
2,"Decent idea, poor quality","The quality of the wood and screws is poor (some knots in the wood).Provides little advantage to just stepping up onto the chair (except no shoe print?). Not very stable as a step stool.Overall, disappointed."
2,"Not particularly good anthropology, and dated as well","I used this book in preparing for an anthropology paper on women's roles in Japan, and regretted the choice. (As a quick note, I have been dragged to several hostess clubs while employed at a Japanese company.) The anthropology itself is pretty sloppy- the author seems oblivious to the fact that, as a westerner (before westerners became common in hostess clubs), her interactions will be extremely different from what normally happens in such clubs. The book is long on theory, but short on observation. I can not recommend it as anthropology, or as an accurate observation on Japanese sexuality."
4,A Great Mug,"I use this mug during my commute to work. Overall I'd say it works pretty well and I have been very satisfied with it. I just put maybe 3 tbsp of coarse ground coffee in the bottom, fill it up with hot water about an inch from the top, wait a few minutes and press the plunger down.My complaints: If you let the coffee sit in the mug for a while it starts to taste funny. I think this is because all the grounds are still in the mug and affect the taste after a while even though they're trapped in the bottom. This problem is kind of inherent in the design so it's not really an issue. Also, I was surprised at how warm the outside of the mug got. It seems to keep the coffee warm long enough, but I didn't expect the outside of the mug to get so warm.Overall, neither of my problems with the mug will stop me from using it, and I would probably buy the product again."
4,A knowledge of Shakespeare and human nature,"Sharon Hamilton evidently knows her way around the works of William Shakespeare and, as she demonstrates in this analysis of Shakespearean depictions of father/daughter relations, around human nature in the raw. Any reading or re-reading of the plays will be immeasurably enhanced by the insights she winkles out. This is a book that thespians especially will benefit by.Happily Ms. Hamilton's attempt to equate the English language's greatest wordsmith with a certain Will Shakspere of Stratford - a dreary and litigious businessman and one-time actor scarcely able to write his own name and sire incidentally of two apparently illiterate daughters - detracts but little from this invigorating volume."
2,The One Man Makes a Successful Product Myth,This book presents Ken Kutaragi as the genius who single-handedly created the successful Playstation. It is just not a realistic picture of how a business runs or how a product becomes a success. It needs to include more information about other people who contributed to the product and the cultural environment in which it originated.The translation from the Japanese also creates a style of grammar that is just not quite right to the English reader.Half-way through the book I decided that my time was more valuable than this book and I needed to move on to something more rewarding (and more entertaining).
4,"Very, very good book...",This book really surprised me. One of the best new space operas to come along since Star Trek and Star Wars. I highly recommend this far-reaching and far-flung sci-fi tale of the 28th Century.
5,The Prince of dark rap,"some what a pioneer of the still largely unknown horror core rap sub genre.dark disturbing and engaging.a strong album for someone who was just 13.wich makes this dark creation even more interesting.its not for everybody,but its perfect for me."
5,ESHAM,"I love this Cd probably his best work songs like I'd rather be dead and I met this lil girly are some of the rap songs made period any one who dont be feelin Esham, well U know what to do."
1,customer service so far is good,"I order a filter, recieved the wrong one BUT. . .the co is working with we to get the right one so WE'LL see soon."
5,Does the job!,"This filter prevents me from using hundreds, if not thousands of paper coffee filters.The previous one lasted 10 years and still was working, but the bottom had started fraying. If I get even half the use I got from the old one, I'll be ahead.The thing costs $5. It's a no-brainer. The service and shipping weren't too much extra. This is the same product I've seen on sale at a local coffee shop for $50.A simple rinse and it's back to service for this filter.Love it!"
3,Mesh seperates from plastic after 4 uses,"It's a typical wire/mesh re-usable filter that works fine until it breaks. My filter started separating where the mesh meets the plastic at the bottom. After only 4 uses, there are now openings large enough to allow coffee grounds to fall through. It would be much more durable if the mesh was one single unit that was slid through the plastic at the bottom of the filter. The way it is now, it is two mesh panels basically glued onto the edge of the plastic. I wouldn't buy this again. There are some more expensive options available that are more durable. Also, note that gold-""toned"" filters simply means gold ""colored"" stainless steel.Real gold plated filters are superior as the coffee and water will not interact and/or degrade the gold-plated mesh of a true gold filter."
1,stay away from all metal filters!!,"Please be informed that paper filters are necessary to absorb the dangerous oil from your coffee which is called cafestol. It raises blood cholesterol and 99% can be removed if you use paper filters!! Metal filters allow this dangerous substance to pass to you 100%. Take care of your health. Coffee is great and has high antioxidants, but use paper filters!!!"
4,works well,"Hope it will last long enough to make it a better choice environmentally than paper. It's nice not to worry about running out of paper filters, but now I spend some extra time & water every day to rinse this one out."
4,Good filter,"This is a nice coffee filter, a little bit more time consuming than paper filters, but works pretty good."
2,Slightly sludgy coffee,"Short and simple: Paper cones make my coffee better. This one lets what I would call silt drip into my coffee pot. It's not tasty, and leaves a strange feel in my mouth. I thought this would be an eco-friendly switch, but it looks like I'm going to back to the paper cones."
2,Paper is better.,I used this filter for a while. I would buy good quality Starbucks coffee but i didn't like the flavor of my coffee. About two weeks ago i switched to a paper filter and the flavor of the coffee is much smoother and flavorful.
5,Great item,No more coffee grounds in our coffee since I started using this filter. Really love it. Easy to clean as well.
5,"In the long run, cheaper than paper!","A friend of mine swore by this filter, and he's somewhat of a coffee aficionado, so I thought I'd try it out. I tend to grind my beans fairly finely, and this filter has not clogged yet. It does allow a minute amount of grounds into the pot, unfortunately. I'm still giving it five stars because I've never had a filter that didn't. I have no idea how long it will last at this point (it's been about 2 or 3 months), but it would surprise me greatly if it didn't outlive enough paper filters to pay for itself and then some."
5,Fast shipping and correct item,Got it in 5 days and does what it suppose to do. Hold my coffee grinds and help make fresh coffee. I went from Mr. Grouch to happy Mr. Grouch after a cup of Joe!
2,Do you like grounds in your coffee,"If you like to chew your coffee, this filter is for you. Otherwise, stick with the paper. It sure looks pretty in its gold gleam on my shelf, though."
3,Works Until It Doesn't,"Apparently this filter is supposed to fit a Cuisinart DTC-975. It does, but the filter basket makes indentations near the top on both sides of the filter mesh. Eventually the indentations will break through. Buy two. You will need another in about a year."
2,"It works, doesn't fit exact","While this filter does work, I had to push it into the filter slot, while the original just dropped in. This is causing a crease in the filter which will ultimately cause it to fail much sooner than it should."
1,Not much fun!,"My boss got these for our daughter when she was born. I was so excited and loved them b/c they were soft, colorful and had different tectures and noises. However, my daughter never bothered with them no matter how much I played with them with her. She'd push my hand aside and try to do other things. They just became annoying because they were always on the floor and in the way (she'd toss them aside as she'd dig through her toy bin looking for things to play with). Even at 15 months, I've pulled them back out and tried to show her how to stack them etc. She wants nothing to do with them. She'd rather play with and stack my plastic containers and pots and pans."
1,I still don't set goals.,The title caught my eye because I'm one who doesn't set goals. The author has some bathroom epiphany that leads him to setting goals. Nothing new here.
1,An absolute disappointment,"Vitals is little more than an undergraduate biology research paper on bacterial evolution, peppered with an incomplete story stretched paper-thin over 330 pages. The Epilogue reads like a work-in-progress plotting tool: a timeline of events and a litany of questions Bear has, for some reason, decided to leave unanswered.There's too much good reading out there to waste time on this."
2,Vitals,"An absolutely fascinating, original biological SF premise doesn't save this book. Even Bear's mention of the South SF Bay salt lagoons, where I'd been hiking that very day, didn't produce more than a passing thrill.The problem here is the plot. It's a basic thriller plot, so there really wasn't much excuse for it falling as flat as it does. Jumps in time and POV add confusion and destroy what tension there is. The plot element of the evil, seductive blonde is lame and overdone, and it's never clear to me why the main character ceases being a threat to the secret organization that starts out by trying to discredit, then subvert, him.The characters go along with the plot: they are forgettable and flat."
3,"Not bad, but could have been better","This would be the least favorite of Bear's books for me, except he wrote Darwin's Children, which is just plain awful.The book has some intriguing science, plot twists and real historic detail woven into it. It could have been a haunting masterpiece. Unfortunately, somewhere two thirds into the story, Bear loses focus. He tries to accomplish so much, that he seems to forget that it needs to tie together in some fashion for the reader.I think a really good editor could have made him go back, lop off ninety pages and tighten the whole thing up, and it would have been swell.As it is -- two thirds swell."
1,Huh?,"My first thought upon finishing the book was ""can't this guy end a book?"" Far-fetched premise, wholly unbelievable characters, and bad guys who can't make up their minds about how bad to be. I doubt I'll read any more by Bear."
2,Keep out of reach of the clinically depressed,"Bear, a writer of hard science fiction with an impressive track record, crosses the blurry line into the techno-thriller novel for a novel with more than a passing resemblance to his own ""Blood Music"" (1986). Both science and prose style are adeptly handled, no complaints there. Unfortunately the plot he traces out is unrelentingly dark, except on those occasions when it becomes even darker.Science fiction fans who find a book's characterization at fault sometimes refer to the Eight Deadly Words -- these, when uttered by a reader, are ""I don't CARE what happens to these people."" This novel is more a case of ""I wish I HADN'T cared what happened to these people."" Because it's not good."
2,"Looks good, but will not hold setting","Looks good, fits well, but will not hold setting. No way to adjust tension as bolt just spins. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Good Prompts for Writing,"I read Rafael Castillo's collection DISTANT JOURNEYS and found the stories interesting and memorable. They were fascinating. Although the book cover does not do justice to the book, the stories do reflect an original voice. I would definitely buy another of Mr. Castillo's books and have used them in my composition classes. Students like the stories because they are short, precise, and entertaining; I like them because they can easily be interpreted at various levels and are excellent prompts for writing."
5,Bonnie Bell Glimmer,"It is really the best around, I really don't know why drugstores have discontinued it. Can't find it anywhere, but on line. Makes me furious when you've used a product for a log time........than all of sudden can't find it! If you like something you almost have to stock up on it, because when you run out, it can't be found!"
1,Refuting caricatures,"There may be some strong arguments Christians can mount against Buddhism, but you won't find any here, because the ""Buddhism"" in this book is a straw man, an absurd caricature. Don't waste your money. - Brian"
3,not as it appears,"This appears to be a satin finish, but it is a very high gloss and very little of the yellow gold shows. Very tiny face. Just not the same in person as in the picture. I sent it back"
3,An OK book,It was an ok book. Could tell that the author had knowledge and skill in writing this book. I found the main characters a bit cliche and was a little disappointed that I didn't get to know them better. It did show however that no matter where you live there is crime....even in alaska.
2,Not Cuisinart,"The product I received was not the Cuisinart GTF-B, but a 'universal' replacement filter stocked by the seller (a Medelco 8-12 cup replacement filter). I suspect that's why other reviewers comment that it doesn't quite fit right. No problems getting a quick refund from the seller, though."
2,Too small,"I have no idea how this would actually work because we were unable to use it. It is made for the smaller filter baskets , and will not work in a 'commercial' sized one (like this size:BUNN BCF250 Commercial Coffee Filters)I found it frustrating and almost impossible to find any ACCURATE sizes on any of the reusable filters. I think that information like that should be required on a product page.I will say that it was very easy to return and we got our money back."
3,A Lesser Collection,"For a collection of the United Artists songs you are far better off buying ""The United Artists Collection"". With that collection you get Lightfoot's first four UA albums -- a total of 49 songs, including all of the songs on ""Very Best"" -- at a lower price. Also check out ""The Original Lightfoot"" which has the complete five UA albums -- a total of 60 songs -- plus a nice booklet, although at a higher price. I gave this ""Very Best"" collection three stars because the songs on it are all good songs, even though it is not the best UA collection available."
5,A drama for all times - not just ritual prayer,"This is an engaging approach to a revered ritual, the Stations of the Cross. The authors pose the question, ""Where you there?"" to fourteen different figures who were likely to have been involved with or accompanied Jesus on the road to crucifixion and his death. Each station begins with the traditional prayer, a short bit of scripture, and then the chosen character's answer to the question. It is a thought-provoking way to walk through the stations and one which takes the participant past ritual and into personal reveries and experiences of daily life. Children and adolescents could truly be drawn into the topic by presenting weekly stations in a dramatic way and the authors provide practical suggestions for such events. While you think you cannot say ""yes"" to the question of ""Where you there?"" This book allows to you answer in the affirmative - daily."
3,Runs small,"These are nice weight and construction, but runs small in the leg and waist.I really wasn't happy with how they feel on."
2,Shrink easily,These sweatpants fit great on the initial wear but they shrunk far too much after only a couple washes. Can't even wear them anymore.
3,Sizing runs very small !!,"I give this a 3 star rating because the weight of the material is great......BUT the sizing is way on the small side. I bought a XX-Large which in my opinion should be labeled XL at the most, possibly even Large. I don't know about you, but I like my sweatpants baggie. I have Hanes XXL sweats and they are perfect, with regards to baggieness. I bought the Russell since they were about 45% less money. However, you DO get what you pay for."
2,Sizing not accurate,"We ordered an XL, and they were more like a L, and a small large at that. They were for my husband and he has an old pair of L Russell sweatpants that fit, and thought that ordering the XL would give him a little more room, which it did not. I didn't return them, because I was able to wear them; I usually wear a large.I will say that the quality was excellent, but consider ordering the next size up when placing your order."
4,Suitable for long travel.......,"I like this track. Its perfectly fine with its shape , colour & looks . Very comfortable during travelling ..."
2,Sweats evolve into Tights,"My expectation of sweats are baggy, loose fitting pants to wear around the house.I'm a 34"" waist so I ordered the medium (as usual). After a handful of washes, they are tight like a new tube sock. I feel like i gained 10 lbs, but I didn't.If I were to buy this item again, I would order -at least- one size larger and suffer the bagginess until the shrinkage stopped.But that's the thing, I won't buy this again...Bottom line, kinda thin and expect shrinkage."
4,Comfortable,"My husband practically lives in these. The description is not correct. They are NOT fleece, they are jersey fabric and not heavy, which is great for the summer. This is a better product than the comparable pants from Champion."
4,Beautiful watch,"This is a very nice looking watch. The band is on the thin side, so it has a bracelet-like effect. The face is a beautiful sapphire blue. Since the face is elongated, it is not quite as easy to read as a perfect circle, but the shape does have a nice look to it so it is a tradeoff. The watch has no second hand, which took me some getting used to as all my previous watches did have second hands. As another reviewer noted, when sized to a perfect fit the clasp does become just slightly difficult to unhook. I had to have 6 links removed because my wrists are tiny. Overall I am very pleased with the watch. I wear it every day and I think it looks great and does its job of telling the time. I'd definitely recommend it at Amazon's price. It seems to be of very high quality."
2,Just ok...,"The pins are ok... one of them came whit a little rust inside the pin hole, look kind of used. Also one of the screws was missing."
2,Sooo Redundant,"I have been waiting for this book since the Blue Diary, and I am sad to say I was disappointed. I have read every one of Alice Hoffman's books and I have to say this is one of my least favorites. Like somebody else mentioned there is so much redundancy in this book. Every other page talks about the same thing, about the rain and smell and peach trees. and like somebody else mentioned there was no one particular character that I really felt close to. I think instead describing the same things over and over she could have elaborated more on the relationships between the characters. But just the fact that I could finish it says something."
3,Improbable Magic,"THE PROBABLE FUTURE is the story of the Sparrow women, who have inhabited Cake House in a small New England town for centuries, and who have extraordinary powers. Sound familiar? That's because this novel seems like an attempt to re-create the delight and magic of PRACTICAL MAGIC. However, in my opinion, it missed the mark. Hoffman's natural (and supernatural) descriptions are not the spice that livens the story as they have in her previous works. They seem forced and overdone, and did not endear any of the characters to me. The only Alice Hoffman book I have ever not wanted to read again."
5,"It's a shame this isn't in print, but at least buy it used","It works. That's the #1 thing you need to know. The author's program was recommended to me by two ex-smokers I trust, and I purchased it online at Allison's site, stopsmoking dot com. If you're not willing to do that, you owe it to yourself to at least try a used copy of her book. Why? Because I don't smoke anymore, after 27 years of addiction."
5,Hooked But Not Helpless by Patricia Alison,"I am so happy to see that people can still buy this book!A friend who had gone through the program and had successfully quit, loaned me her book. That was in September 2003, and I can't believe this coming September will be 8 years since I quit!!What is so special about this book is that it changes the way you THINK about smoking, and the way you THINK about quitting! I did not feel like I was being deprived at all... by changing my thinking patterns. The book also walks you through a process which is very helpful too. The book is so interesting to read I couldn't put it down, and when I was done reading it, I quit smoking.I smoked for 20 years and had never been 24 hours without a cigarette until after I read this book."
5,Does exactly what it's supposed to,Caddy arrived quickly and was in perfect condition. Even came with screws needed to install. Revived an old laptop to working status once more! Not to sure it's happy about it as it sits in my garage and gets used for ECU tuning now. Thanks Amazon!
5,Dell Latitude HD Caddy D600,Found this previously used part in excellent condition with all needed parts in the package. The screws fit HD with no problem and the HD connector made good electrical connection on original placement as well as subsequent installations. What I want to see when I purchase used equipment.
3,basic info,If you are an agent and have been doing online marketing this probably won't be a big help. If you are just getting going it makes for a good read and has some helpful info.
3,A Good Read,"I am not a history buff nor do I know anything about navel matters, but the author has presented some real food for thought in this book and I found it very educational. It is a good read."
4,Intricate artwork,"Excellent depiction of Christmas celebrated around the world, but I was suprised to see how intricate the art is in this book. Colored pencils or markers are a must for this book."
2,Boring,"I don't care for this book at all, seems like something a child would do. I found it to be kind of boring, not sure what I expected, this isn't it. I'm sure there are colorists who will enjoy it, just not the type of book I want to color"
4,Great 1st book on this topic,Great 1st book on this topic. I was interested in starting a non-profit and this book provided a clear and detailed way to get started. The large pages and font make it an easy read and the chapters are organized well. Lacks extreme depth but touches on many important areas and considerations.
4,The kids will play for hours,A popular game. I purchased this for my 6 year old nephew and he loves it. The 9 year old plays with it as well. Truth be told - my husband also sits there and plays the game. Very comparable to a game for the full systems.
4,Nice slippers,"These are comfortable & fit really nicely. They're pretty warm but not AS warm as I thought they'd be (but I have horrible circulation so my hands & feet are always cold). The only drawback is they're suede so you can't throw them in the washer. And occasionally they'll leave a black scuff mark on the parquet but it comes right off if you rub it. They're very pretty though (I got them in blue) & feel as comfy as wearing a pair of tennis shoes. In fact I've walked out of the house twice with them on my feet, ready to go to the park thinking I'd already put my shoes on! Haha!"
5,Comfort & Support,The blues are lovely. I use this in my classroom since I spend endless hours projecting images on the wall and using a smart-board with computer images.
2,Allsop 28822 Mouse Pad Pro Memory Foam Mouse Pad,"I'm just so-so about it. The wrist pad is comfortable, but I don't like how the entire perimeter of the overall mouse pad curves up around the edges. It should lie flat on my desk. I'm not crazy about the rain drop design either. Why not also offer black - the most common standard color for mouse pads?Update: I'm lowering my rating to 2 stars. When I put my wrist on the wrist pad, which I now see is tilted at a forward angle, the mouse pad ahead of the wrist pad lifts up into the air. It's a see-saw effect. This is bad design and/or production quality control. Obviously, when you would use the pad, putting downward pressure on the wrist pad, the mouse area of the pad should remain flat on the desk.I just bought a black Handstands ""memory foam mouse mat"" at Walmart for $1 less that doesn't have these issues."
2,Nothing new here,"I gave up at page 156. When only one new major plot development occurred by that point, I just decided the book had wasted enough of my time. This romance novel has a decent idea behind it, and a possibly fascinating story line. Here's a witch who uses her supernatural powers to help businesses flush out bad employees. There could be numerous uses for someone with these kinds of skills. But the story is slow going, and the color-by-numbers romance scenes wore on my nerves--with the heroine always pulling back at the last minute. How many times have we seen that before? The dialogue was completely unnatural and I don't know how many times the reader had to learn that the heroine didn't believe in soulmates. Okay, we get it! Really, this smacks of amateurish writing with its heavy dependence on adverbs and lack of good, strong action. Where was the editor in this project?Let's just say it was a good idea that never lived up to its promise."
3,good story line,For the most part I thought it was overall a good book. I was dissappointed that it didn't have more actually magic in it. maybe a magical fight would have been great. but like i said overall it was a good book.
1,Cheap Craftsmanship for 100$,"Looks great on amazon, but when you open the box its a different story. First in comparison to the black picture, you will notice the Fo antique paint job which is really light brown paint spread across the metal so thick you can see the brush marks. This ""paint job"" is continued across the chains, hooks, and bolts. It is so tacky I would expect to see this sold at a craft fair for 25$. Next you will notice that the hooks do not fit into the center, only along the outside edges leaving a hole in the center while hanging pots. Lastly the welds are pretty rustic with the center hoops disjointedly not meeting on the other side. They mostly connect only with the weld. I fool heartedly tried to salvage the pot rack by sanding down the brown paint and repainting it. After about 6 hours worth of work, purchasing new chains, and new hooks to fit in the center the pot rack looks OK. I wish I had sent this back. This is very cheap craftsmanship for 100$."
1,Common sense in book-form,"I bought this book hoping it would help me plan a trip to France with my 10 month old----it really helped me with nothing. A lot of common sense ""tips"" (be sure to always have snacks on hand! bring enough formula/baby food for the flight and a possible delay!), yet I could not find information on car seats, high chairs, outlet covers in hotel rooms, etc. Don't waste your money on this book."
5,Strength,"Mary Ellen Ton Is my aunt, I wanted the book because I lost my copy and wanted my grandchildren to know that know matter what happens in life with help you caan get through it."
4,Cuisinart Coffee Pot,"the only negative i found with this coffee pot is that you can't measure how much water you have. You have to use the measurements inside the actually machine which is not that big of a deal, but I'm used to being able to see how much water I'm putting in the pot itself. Otherwise, I am very happy with the coffee pot."
1,Terrible tasting cold coffee,We received the Cuisinart 12 cup stainless thermal pot a couple of years ago and recently noticed that water was trappped in between the inner and outer containers. My wife noticed the coffee tasting funny and tried to clean it but to no avail. She also said it was not keeping the coffee hot. This morning I thought I would look and see if what the problem was and noticed a small hole in the inner container. This is what was causing both problems. We thought these pots would last forever.
5,Perfect Replacement,"This is a perfectly identical replacement for my original stainless steel one. Since they are only 10 cups (which are midget cups as far as my husband and I are concerned) and not enough for two working home offices, I purchased a second one to brew a second pot and keep one at each of our workstations. They work wonderfully and keep the coffee hot for 2 plus hours."
4,The usual great bliss quality but baby powder smell,"I love Bliss body butter, and like the other body butters this one is soothing going on with a lovely long lasting moisturized feeling on my skin. However, this is the only Bliss that I ding for the scent. I covered the label and had the three guys I live with all try to guess the scent, and every one said baby or talcum powder. I can't get the vanilla either, not sure what Bergamot is supposed to smell like. The moisturizer is thick and rich but not greasy."
2,Portuguese Please !,"If you love Brazilian Music the way I do you should skip this one. In my opinion, this music was meant to be sung in Portuguese. To me, this sounds like the Beatles singing in Italian, not their best work. There is a Compact Jazz album by Antonio Carlos Jobim with only one song in English. Try it !"
1,The same old repertoire from Brazil: Time to renew it!,"How many times have you heard a different release of ""The Girl from Ipanema"" even ""transsexualized"" into ""The Boy"" like Ella unfortunately did and now Ms.Clooney repeats? It's incredible that the same old Bossa Nova hits keep on being recorded over and over and, worst of all, without any creative differentiation. Also the low keys and lack of vibrato make this just a bureaucratic album, recorded just to say: let's get the wave and also record Bossa Nova. In Brazil, when everything gets wrong in the end, we're used to saying that ""all has ended in a ball around a big ""pizza"". Even Pizzarelli's presence was not able to save this CD. Sorry. Skip it!"
5,Excellent,"What a great book. The author just oozes old timey experience. He didn't dumb down the material. He does cover some detail of XDR and RPC, which I find rather welcome actually. Other prerequisites are expected to be met before reading the book which delves into all kinds of aspects about NFS.This fine Addison-Wesley tome is an excellently welcome reference right alongside the works of Stevens, etc. in my library.Amazon lists this as paperback-only, but I delightedly lucked into a hardbound copy from a used marketplace seller. Hooray!"
2,Eh. . .,"This book started as a fun look into the world of entitle-brats who wind up in the future. I thought the author's grasp of youth in the 90's was funny and insightful. Once everyone wakes up, this novel takes a definite turn for the dull and diluted. It never felt like there was much of a point to Alec's cause since he was as nasty and unlikable as everyone else around him. I kept reading because I thought there might be something to the story only to find out that no, there really wasn't, except that if you're going to make it in this particular universe you have to have extremely long toes."
3,Mediocre Near-Space Story,"To quote another reviewer, who gave the book five stars:""This is not a great piece of literature, and if it were in a different genre, I wouldn't have given it five stars.""Amen. This is not great literature. Call it like it is, regardless of the genre: paper-thin speculative fiction about near-space exploration set about a hundred years from now. The nanites and cryogenic storage are rather standard. The history lessons are uniformly pessimistic, but may match your world view.On the flip side, I appreciated the homo-superior race and their dialogue. I also found the near-space setting to be intriguing. The story was just engaging enough to keep me turning the pages, although the subject matter was occasionally dry enough to make me skim past certain pieces.All in all, an OK read, but there are certainly better SF books out there to read."
1,Sucks you and Lets you down big time,"Pretty good for 1st 90%. Then something happened...he was late and publisher demanded he finish.....he rattled on without know the an ending. The ending is drivel. Interesting story and premise, but then he forgot to write an ending and put together a bunch of nonsense akin to the famous Dallas tv show season ending explanation being a dream!. Felt totally cheated and waste of time reading the book"
2,Blowing Purple Chunks of Reason,"I like all of Mr. Steeles works. Well, that is no longer a true statement. The book description sounds fantastic! The book reality is shatteringly bad.I have never been so bored with a 'Steele' book. The plot is drawn out longer than Coney Island summer taffy. This should have been a short story.I expected insights and conclusions. What I got were a bunch of ""high flautin"" aliens and some space robber barons that fancied themselves pirates. Yuck!This book could have gone in so many interesting ways; too bad it avoided all of them. Save your money and buy a copy of Larry Niven's A WORLD OUT OF TIME. Same premise... handled with more style!"
2,Play Mat?,"I am very disappointed in this product. Had I known how very small this mat was, I would never have added it to my registry. I thought I would be able to lay my son on it for ""tummy time"" but even at 2 weeks old, he's twice the size of this thing. My main disappointment is that a friend purchased this item for me, I feel bad that she threw $... away. I'll make use of it by hanging it in his crib, or behind the car seat in a years time when he's in a forward facing seat."
3,And I still can't stand them...,"I read ""Dealing with People You Can't Stand"" by the same author and I loved it. It had lots of funny, real-life antecdotes and even though the main points could have been summarized into a pamphlet - it was a great read. This one had none of that. The fairy-tale like stories written to illustrate the personality types just didn't hold my attention and weren't in the least entertaining.Also, in the back of the book - they own up to the fact that the book does not cover ALL types of family dysfunction such as alcoholism, co-dependency, and drug abuse. (I wish this disclaimer had been a note at the BEGINNING of the book...) Come to find out - these are additional personality types that are much too complex to deal with and you need professional help. Silly me. I thought that was the ONLY cause of family dysfunction. :-)"
3,Out door garndener,The face shield works great but doesn't allow for the use of the safety ear protection.
2,Too hot to trot,I suppose this product to be good for eye protection but I wouldn't know. I purchased it for my lawn care workers to use while weed-eating but they could not use them in the heat. The face mask builds up so much heat that they could not breathe while wearing them. Needless to say they are not using them at this time. Maybe when the temps give us a break.
4,Not his best work but in the top three,"I have seen many movies with Eric Roberts and this one does stand out as one of his better movies.I really think you need to watch the movie twice to get the full effect and understanding. This movie makes you think it is not something you watch on the couch to zone out. This movie was excellently made and put together. While some DISCRETION is need about some of the more graphic scenes I will leave it up to viewer to watch them and enjoyed them as much as I did. Keep this team of actor,writer, and producer together, the movie magic is good."
3,"Good, but not the greatest","Esham is one of the more origional thinkers in rap. His subgenre Acid Rap is the perfect label for hs style on Judgement Day vol.2. Living in incest and Crib Death are essential tracks for this album. For laughs try Finger In The Cake Mix. Momma was a Junkie was memorable along with Dying To Be Down. But in my opinion I recomend this album. Personally though I started with Boomin Words From Hell, then Closed Casket."
5,DOWN SINCE DAY ONE!,"CHECK THIS OUT! I'VE BEEN DOWN WITH ESHAM SINCE HE DROPPED ESHAMS BOOMIN'""WORDS FROM HELL"" THE RED TAPE! WHICH I STILL HAVE IN MY OWN PERSONAL VAULT, I BELIEVE ITS VALUED AT ABOUT 6 BILLS. I'VE BEEN DOWN FOR TEN YEARS, SO IF YOU WANT ANYONES OPINION ITS MINE! SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE JUDGEMENT DAY VOLUME 1 AND 2 YOUR MISSING OUT, YOU NEED TO HERE THAT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE REST, OR YOU WILL BE LOST IN THE SAUCE. SO GET THEM NOW! THEY ARE DOPE AS HELL! TO THIS DAY I AM CREATING ESHAM LISTENERS, I ALWAYS BUY MORE THAN ONE ALBUM AND SELL IT FOR A FEW DOLLARS LESS JUST TO LOCK THEM ON, TO ME ITS WELL WORTH IT, CAUSE IF THEY DON'T KNOW ESHAM THE UNHOLY BLACK GETO DEVIL THEY AIN'T ON THAT LEVEL!"
5,well written for the imagination,I baught these books for my daughter who just learned to read she will be in first grade this year and just loves fairies. She loves these books as well as drawing and pretending shes the characters in the stories. I would highly recommend it to any one whose child can read at least at a 2nd grade level and loves fairies and using their imagination.
3,Good book but not for JK's,This book has a lot of info on older TJ's & CJ's but no recent info about the newer JK's
4,Good read when you're new to tricking a jeep.,"Your best bet for tricking your jeep is to find a forum and lurk/search. And of course read books like this one. Then have at it! Or, if you can afford it.. buy a jeep already trick. If you're not really into hard core off roading then this book is probably over your head. But still cool to see what you can do to a jeep. There is only one."
4,An unexpected pleasure,"I was searching for a film with Rosemary Clooney! And Amazon's search engine give me a 1994 movie in the list... I bought it just to check if this was an error, noticing also that Georges Lucas was executive producer. Intriguing for the least, for a movie I never heard of. The result is : - Rosemary Clooney is effectively in the film (she sing a song as our heroes have a romantic encounter on the roof of the radio station), so congratulations to the Amazon's search engine; - the movie is very well built, good rythm, good sympathic and living caracters, very clever evocation of the radio omnipotent era (30's), professionnal music and comic sets, excellent sound and picture, an special award for lighting, costumes and decors. Well, our teens play this movie at least 2 times a week (we have hundred,s of movies), they laugh and it is one of the big hits of the last batch we bought. So, no real weakenesses, real fun without pretention"
1,"""Who Murdered This Movie?""","A painstakingly unwatchable bunch of scratch about a radio station that has management members dropping like flies on the station's debut night. The murders are the most ridiculously old and obsolete things: some uninvited voice on an intercom says a rhyme and someone dies shortly after. A bunch of these in addition to bull about showing radio commercials and more bull about a husband and ex-wife both working at the same station, both looking to get back together. All the jokes are baby jokes: a guy slips and falls, a guy gets thrown out of a room, or someone shuts the door on a guy. HORRIBLE"
4,A great period who dunnit,"A great star studded, who's who, murder mystery from before the era of the boob tube. Funny, fast moving, and just plain entertaining.Be sure to keep an eye out as George Burns, Rosemary Clooney, and Billy Barty all make appearences.Bob Goldthwait also tends to steal scenes as a goofball writer."
5,the arrival of Dr. Hoffman,"Caught in a raging storm, Victoria Winters is invited by Barnabas Collins to stay overnight at the Old House. While sleeping in the bedroom belonging to the long-dead Josette Collins, Vicki is awakened by the singing of a young girl - the ghost of Sarah Collins.Dr. Julia Hoffman arrives at Collinwood posing as an historian. While investigating the circumstances surrounding Maggie Evans' disappearance, Dr. Hoffman discovers supernatural forces exist at Collinwood."
5,It was a very good book giving a human aspect to kennedy,The book was really great and I have read a lot of books on John F Kennedy. The book gave a human aspect of the campaign and the day to day life of the kennedy administration.
2,Disappointing,The DVD box states that this movie is 118 minutes long. Wrong! As presented on the disk it is approximately 100 minutes. As much as 18 minutes have been chopped off-- primarily the true ending of the movie. This film has been mentioned in two books on the Italowesterns and I know how it is supposed to end. But not here. Too bad.
5,Really fun!! My dog is a genius! LOL!,"I am the President of Angel Pups, an organization that trains kids (middle school and up) to work with their dogs and then takes them to visit nursing homes. For fun, last week we all did this IQ test together! We all laughed SO hard, some kids had tears streaming down their faces!! It is a blast to see how smart your dog is and what you can do to help them improve their intellectual capacity. This week we're doing the Owner IQ test!! I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys working with dogs!!"
1,The mirror I did not get,"Very unhappy with this purchase. I ordered a mirror and I got a piece of rubber in a box. Purchased the mirror on sale and was told by a rep that I had to repurchase the mirror. And send the piece of rubber that was sent to me back, now the mirror is two times the price I paid. To much hastle for a frigen mirror wish they would have sent me the mirror properly the the first time. Last time I will buy car parts on amazon."
1,Not Worth the Money at all,"I have now had two of these bags shipped to me, and both have gone back. I am not sure if what I had gotten is a newer design or not, but it is not as good as what people have stated in these other reviews..here is why..First of all the bag is WAY to bulky and constanly moves on the belt, so you are always ajusting it and it's not light. Also with both bags I had the belts and Suspenders started to fall apart after just TWO days. Imagine if It was used longer what would happen. Spend your $$ on something else, this is just not made well at all."
5,Good deal,These bags are a great deal for the price!! I like how the pockets are big and can hold a lot of tools and the suspenders are also fairly decent except the pads move around a lot. The only thing you should do is go buy a home depot belt cuz they are better than the one it comes with but u will have that one for reserve. So you will end up spending about $60 for some great CLC bags!
5,Coarse Grit,"It seems all rock tumblers come with a bag of rocks to tumble and enough grit to tumble that one bag of rocks. I ordered the coarse and fine grit and the polish so I could tumble the rocks that I already owned.There's no instructions with the grit, so I had to look up the amounts to use on the internet. Having done that, these grits worked great. It seemed to me that they polished the rocks at each stage faster and more nicely than the other grit I had used. I like them better than the grits that came with the tumbler, and they will last me for many, many batches of rocks."
3,Good product,"I purchased this because I can't get off low chairs and such. When I tried it at home, it set me down with a jerk as it settled, and it's a little high for a normal size chair. I have chairs high enough around home, so I need it when I go out, but don't go out often, so have yet to use it. I think it will relieve a lot of struggles and embarrassment at restaurants and other gatherings."
5,A Loyal Companion,"Barbara Metzger is one of my favorite authors. She is so witty and I really enjoy the inclusion of animals in her stories. This is one of my favorites!! This is a book I could read many times and still enjoy it. If you don't want people wondering why you are laughing your head off in public, read The Loyal Companion in the privacy of you home. It's a hoot!"
4,Easy to put up and sturdy,This little tent rocks. I don't use it as a shower but I don't think it would hold 5 gallons of water. As a toilet shelter I couldn't imagine what to complain about.
5,LOVE these gloves.,"These are the only gloves I'll buy. It's hard to find them other than online, but I was stoked to find them here. I work outdoors events which means I'm lifting a lot of things (plywood, boxes, whatever) and these things are very durable and cushioned in all the right places."
5,music snobs suck,"hey j, maybe if you weren't such a snob you would recognize good music, oh and by the way, sanborn is an artist that is never afraid to venture into new territory and has raised the bar for all those that follow. not bad for a kid who picked up an instrument as a child to save his life. he's an inspiration, your just a snob. peace"
5,Excelent Micro Slave,This is one of the most sensitive micro slave units. It consistently triggers the flash under the most difficult situations.
2,"Works Okay, Not Great","We purchased this for our two new guinea pigs. They do a good job of getting the hay out and rolling it around.I agree with other reviewers that the little filler door is worthless and I just pop off the side, fill it over the hay bag, and pop the side back on.I like that it is free standing or can hang on the side of a cage.I don't like that you can't choose the color you want. We ended up with burgundy.***UPDATE*** After using this for a few weeks, I'm really not sold on it. It is hard to get apart (too hard to fill in the 'door' and too hard to close up by taking the side off. We just switched to a hay hanger. Hopefully that will do the trick."
3,Not really fun for the rabbit.,"It doesn't really spin, my bunny just plucks hay from it occasionally and that's about it. He eats more hay from the floor than out of this thing. I recommend getting a regular hay holder or something cheaper, if available. This item works but only just as good as a regular stationary hay holder. On the negative side, it's a bit of a pain to refill every time."
5,Love this cuz my rabbits love it!,"I was unsure at first but decided to give it a try, it is a great price. It's easy to open, fill and close. Easy to mount on the cage, easy to remove the ball for refilling and cleaning. My bunnies even love to roll it around on the floor. (I only let them do that when I'm in the mood to clean up the mess of hay bits.) But this a great, interactive way to feed my rabbits the hay they need and keep their minds stimulated."
2,Disappointed,"I'm sorry, but I was truly disappointed in Mr Fenton'stranslation of the Bible. He brought up some good points, butwhat got me right away was his pulling out the word for ""image""in Genesis and making it ""shadow"" which really makes no sense.I still think the best translation is the KJV with a StrongsConcordance. And there is one called ""The Companion Bible""that is the KJV with a wide margin explaining the verse usingthe meaning of the words of the old Hebrew,Aramaic and Greeklanguages, which you can find in the Strongs Concordance. Thereis also something called the ""Interlinear Bible"" by J.P.Green,Sr. It is a set that gives you the English translation and theHebrew and Greek with numbers over the words that are codedwith the Strongs Concordance which makes it so much easier touse and understand.If you could add these books to your stock I would behappy to highly recommend them.Thank you for your time,Barbara"
1,Gaah! Disgusting!,"The content of this book is appalling. Hedren and her husband are apparently vapid, self-indulgent, stupid, and spoiled Hollywood ninnys with more money than common sense.Hedren encountered big cats on a film set. Bedazzled by their exoticness, she and her husband accumulated and warehoused nearly 100 animals. Hedren is totally ignorant and oblivious of the animal cruelty involved in this.It is just plain wrong to keep a wild animal for a pet, even if it is beautiful. The big cats are not domestic, not loving, and Hedren has scars to prove it. It can only be ego gratification. ""The big cat community"" discussed supports poaching and extinction in the wild by maintaining demand for these ""pets"".Avoid this book at all costs."
2,Is this Genesis or the life of rabbi Visotzky.,"Using the ""tawdry little soap opera"" school of criticism, this rabbi proceeds to reduce all the ancient matriarchs and patriarchs to charictatures and harpies. His ""personal"" characterizations are laughable, his name-dropping is irritating, and his interpretations are more about his divorce than about the actual characters that inhabit the first book of Torah.It's not that his characterizations are offbase, but they are just tedious. Besides that does the reader really have to know that this unmarried ""rabbi"" is trying to decide between vasectomies and condoms for birth control methods?Great if you are unfamiliar with the book of Genesis and you want something to make you look at the Bible in an un-Sunday school fashion. Awful if you are looking for anything in the way of serious scholarship."
3,Only OK,"These are OK. I prefer my vise grips, in particular, my long nose angled vise grips over these because they squeeze the clamp more. Probably would not buy again if I could have a do-over. I'd just stick to vise grips."
3,Made in Taiwan - come on OTC!,"I like having high-quality tools; I like buying USA-made products. I was very disappointed to see that these are cheap imports. Aside from a model number, the only thing etched on the tools are ""Made in Taiwan"". You can't even find OTC's name on these! Having worked for OTC for many years and being a fan of USA-made tools, these were a disappoinment."
3,"OK for the price, maybe","I should have expected that for the price these were going to be cheap, but boy was I surprised just how cheap they actually are. The spring tension on the retaining lever is almost non-existent, in order to get the retaining teeth to engage you have to help the lever along by hand. The teeth themselves are very large, and only the last one is actually tight enough on most clamps to actually relieve pressure on the hose - you actually have to put so much pressure on the handles to engage that tooth that the handles contort and twist. Even with these in my toolbox I find myself passing over them for plain old 90-degree needle nose pliers. Save your money, or if you need to use these on a regular basis go with a manufacturer of higher quality."
2,A book about addicts,"This book is really about addicts. The main difference being instead of getting high on alchol or drugs - they get high on blood. In the beginning of the book some of the ""vampires"" are trying to give up blood in an AA type arrangement. They self destruct from within and from there on it's all down hill.I found this a depressing book full of very self indulgent characters. In the end I didn't really care what happened to them. Let them overdose on blood and make the world a better place. Nasty I know, but that's the effect this book had on me.It gets 2 stars for an original idea, but I wouldn't read any more about these people again given the choice."
5,Great Heater!,"I bought one of these last year to help out my oil bill and it works so very well that I just purchased 3 more! Excellent product, great heat output, able to adjust vent for heater. You can set it for a temp and it heats to it then powers down itself. Very quiet, can program it for x amount of hours or continuously on. The case stays cool which is great as we have 3 small dogs, you can also place it against a wall because of it staying cool. We actually turned off our oil furnance and just use these heaters and they keep the rooms at a comfortable warmth, plus the electricity is so very much cheaper than OIL... I highly recommed this heater and Amazon!! Quick shipping and as always packaged well!"
2,Energy Hog,It looks nice and heats a small room relatively well. But my energy bill jumped $100.00 in one month. Won' be using this unit unless I absolutely have to.
1,Broke within 24 hours!!,"I was so excited with the size for our detached guest room. It's freezing in that room and two of our daughters were coming home for Christmas and sleeping in there. The heater was very easy to use, it took about four hours to heat the room from 50 degrees to 76. We turned it on low during the night and off in the morning. They said it was still a bit chilly but we had lots of blankets on the bed. I turned it on later in the day and it was working, and then it just shut off!! It said to unplug it for 10 minutes then plug it back in and turn it on, but it is dead!! I'm returning it."
5,Lasko Heater,"Last year, I stayed at a friend's home. It was quite cool in the bedroom. However, her husband placed a Lasko heater in the room and I was very surprised how this small heater heated this large room in no time. I purchased two last year and one more this year. I would like to caution you that it only work in a closed area. If you have an open room, it will not heat up."
3,Just ok,"Last year,we had one of these in a small (10X10) out building. It was ok. It kept the room kinda warm even on cold nights. Problem is,it doesn't keep your feet warm. Had to get another small heater that would heat my feet and I'm not usually one to get cold easily."
2,Not for bigger rooms,Based on the size and description I thought it would be appropriate for a larger area. Not the case. Is not nearly as powerful as you're led to believe.
4,Solid product,"This does the trick for a good price. Don't be fooled into thinking that it will heat a large cold room by itself--it won't. But if your space is small, and/or if you're going to sit near this heater, you'll be fine."
3,"Good in essence, lower in form","This book try to tackle a very hard, even if not old problem : How to model the architecture and what approach can be adopted ? The high value here is : they do it ! I think the approach adopted here is at least a very good starting point and the multiple view approach looks like Kruchten's idea. Another good thing is the improvements proposed to UML for architechture. My highest regret is about examples proposed here : They are too complex and the ideas behind the approach is hidden behind the exemple themselves which are hard to understand. Moreover, we have four example, all seems to be real time example. I would like to have several domain here, like B2B architechture and classic IS architecture. Finally, it's a pitty to gives only 3 stars for a book where I feel 5 stars possible..."
4,Memory Lane,Had to find this album again. had it on cassette in 1998 while in Seattle. Wore it out getting my spirit uplifted during a dark period in life. Helped me get through and some! 15 years later I reflect o how far prayer and praise has brought me. Love it!
5,live performance,"I recently had the pleasure of hearing a few degrees perform live at a metro Atlanta cafe. Normally when an artist is performing in this venue, he or she has to suffer loud conversations from disinterested patrons... not to mention the clinking of coffee mugs and dishes. But this was different. When Jen sang, the audience was respectfully quiet and background noise was kept to a minimum. Most of us just stood or sat there in awe as we listened to the voice of an angel. In truth, I'm not sure which of the songs on this album were performed, but everything I heard I would rate from good to excellent. The songs tend to cover a variety of genres, from folk to alternative rock, with even a little country mixed in. But like I said, Jen's performance made them all spell-binding. Everyone owes it to themselves to get this album and hear a true artistic talent."
5,Book review- Blind Courage,"Originally I ordered this book for a class, but as soon as I started reading it, I fell in love with the testimony. Not only does it challenge the reader but this book as shows the challenge that Bill Irwin faced in life and his encouraging attitude towards others in the same situation and his witness for God."
4,The Best of the Scooby-Doo Videos as per my Grandchildren,I bought two copies of this video as two of my grandchildren almost wear mine out when they come to visit. I have several Scooby-Doo videos but this is their favorite. They both (different families) have this on their Christmas List.
5,Probably our son's favorite movie,"This is cheesy, in typical Scooby Doo style, but our 4 year old son loves it! He will watch it over and over again if we let him. He loves to pretend he's a pirate and sings the songs from the movie while dancing around. I was a little freaked out by the ""Ghost Pirates"" the first time I watched it but my son doesn't seem scared by them at all."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a big Scooby fan, who is raising three small Scooby fans. This video was very disappointing. The story was even more ridiculous than the previous movies. This is probably the worst of the recently released movies. The only good thing that I can say about it is that Scrappy is not in it... That being said, the movie does hold my kids' attention, so I guess it is not a complete waste..."
1,Not for younger kids.,Bought this toy for a third grader. So many parts and difficult instructions the entire thing got scattered across a room and never used correctly. Not one magic trick learned.Big box though - so it makes a great gift impression.
5,For the price I paid - a great value!,"Bought this for my 9 year old son for Christmas - at under nine dollars it was a great value! The tricks are perfect for a beginner and there is plenty to keep him interested for quite awhile. The DVD was also very helpful in learning tricks. Yes, the pieces are plastic and cardboard -- but for the price and a beginner - that's just fine. Overall it's been a hit and I look forward to his coming magic shows."
3,"You get what you pay for,","The price was amazing. Gave it to my son, he did 2 tricks and never played with it again. When I asked him why he didn't like it he basically stated it was boring. The magic piece I got him a year ago which was smaller in size but had much more interesting tricks but cost much more $$$ had tricks that were much more interesting."
3,Her Man of Affairs,The Book was between a Jane Austen and contemporary author. It was easy listening but not alot to the plot or story line.
5,What a rush with Sonic Rush,Great game for the money. Son just loves it and has made a great addition to his already numerous Sonic games for Game Cube
4,A good buy,"At first the game is frustrating because it is very fast but, once you get the hang of it the game can be VERY entertaining. You can also set the game from Normal mode to Easy mode if it's still too hard. This game is one of my favorites and I recommend it."
4,pleased,This game has been very fun to play. The price is right and the seller was very prompt in sending the product. no glitches like i have found from some sellers. i would recommend buying a game from this seller anytime. i would do it again!
3,Doesn't work with my Canon 430 EZ,Bought this for fill flash but it won't work with my Canon flash. Too bad since I can adjust the output of the Canon for different situations. It works with a cheap Vivitar unitI have so it isn't completely worthless.
5,"Fast Shipping, Good Product","I received my new saw only four days after ordering it, ... and I live in Hawaii. The box was slightly damaged on the bottom but the saw was spared from the abuse.I ordered one of these saws for my job about a year ago and promised myself I'd get one when I could. After seeing this special ""SB"" package that included the outfeed and side supports and an extra blade, well, the timing seemed right.This saw can compete with many contractors saw in terms of power and accuracy. I spent about an hour tuning the usual areas that would need checking and adjustment, not uncommon before using just about any saw when new. It was close to being ""right"" and corrections were minimal.Overall, another good product from a company that puts a lot of good ideas into their tools (I especially love the rack and pinion fence)."
3,Different,"This book is defiantly in a category of its own. I must admit even after reading the book I am still skeptical about the workings of Chi and energy. The book does however give an interesting tail of the path of a true martial artist and the dedication they must undergo to achieve perfection. The writing style of this book is very straightforward in my opinion. It cuts to the chase and give step by step descriptions of various ninja skills and mediation techniques. The author is also very honest about his opinions and dosesn't hold back about his feelings for ""typical americans"". The only problem is the constant reference to foreign people, events, and places which requires the reader to do some of his/her own research to understnad. Overall I think anyone who is interested on what it takes to train in martial should read this book or even if you just want to learn what a true ninja is."
1,Bizarre and Unlikely,It gets at least one star for sheer wacky entertainment value. I've read all his books and they are simply too bizarre and wacky for the author to expect a rational person to believe. Add to that various things that are bogus and u cant expect a favorable review. For example the author claimed a black belt in Chi Kung (or Qi Gong) yet there is no such thing. In another book he claims he and his mentors fight aliens telepathically... Enough said OK.
2,I'll have to disagree..,"I hate to disagree with the previous poster, but I found this video very disappointing.You learn nothing about the techniques or strategies used, you do not get to know the members at all, you learn nothing of the logistics of the trip, nothing about the fly's or equipment used, etc.Yes, the constant mechanical breakdowns were interesting to see, and these guys (who all seem like nice guys, by the way) sure can fish, but I left with absolutely nothing from this film. Also, I thought the film quality itself was poor.To be honest, I'm shocked at how much I really disliked it and found it to be waste of my time. I thought I'd come away with something from it.last night I watched the second one ""Kiwi Camo"" and found it much more enjoyable and informative. (overall better quality)"
5,Enchanting!,"Although difficult to find, this beautifully illustrated little tome is an essential in the library of anyone who is enchanted with our feline friends.Written by a hereditary witch, the more than 50 spells were inspired by the journals of the author's great-grandmother, a Victorian ""wisewoman"".It is written in an engaging style, with each of it's 89 pages framed in alternating black and white or full-colour moon, star and sun borders.This book is divided into categories, such as: ""Naming your Cat"", ""Healing Spells"", ""Spells for Love and Enchantments"", ""Spells for Good Luck"", ""Weather Spells"" as well as two delightful ""Fairy Spells"", and an index to the individual spells.An example of a magickal name for a female cat is given as:""Aurelia""'Golden': for a queen who is""haughty, flighty in her affections,""beautiful in appearance, adores""home-comforts and luxury; she is""disdainful of other cats.""I was delighted to receive this book as a birthday gift, and I highly recommend it!"
5,"I pre-judged, reluctantly watched, and was so surprised!","I grew up watching the leads playing much different characters on television. This movie defied every notion I had of the actors and the newsroom formula film. It was surprising in its building of plot and characters. It was light-weight, almost comedic at times, heartbreaking and human at others. From Webb's upbeat character who is happily married but still haunted by the loss of a wife and child...to the senior writer who waits for news of her pilot grandson, the movie is build on real emotions and characters. The at times silly rapport of a team of co-workers is balanced with the tension and sorrow of the news they must cover. It doesn't matter they are shown working against the clock, pecking away at their typewriters and cutting and pasting their page, the movie is timeless. There is a real- time feel to the film. I really, really liked it."
1,offensive,"I hate to admit I read this book. As a traditional christian, as you wish to call me, I was a little suspicious with the first chapter. First, I read On Basilisk Station and didn't like it. Nevertheless, I gave Weber a chance to make it up in the next book. The Graysons are right. Manticore's lucky they don't get crushed because the are so weak. They allow women to participate. It's a disgrace. Basically, I think it's a sin to read this book."
2,Not a Great Product,"I can't compare these pacifiers to others because they're the only kind we've given to our newborn daughter. She takes them and doesn't seem to have a problem with them. I have a few complaints though- they accumulate gunk where the pacifier attaches, water gets inside the pacifier part when we boil them, and they leave marks on my daughter's cheeks. And because they're so tight against her cheeks, her cheeks are red and moist after she spits it out. I'm going to switch to a different product before they give her a rash. Definitely do not get these pacifiers."
1,just use double layer ziploc bags with some ice cubes - works better than this product,"This cooler looked cute so I bought it.I did a test, however, and found that ziploc bags work better to insulate and take up far less space.What you do is take a 2 gallon ziploc bag, fill it halfway with ice, then put another ziploc bag in there with your drinks, food, etc., then seal the inner ziploc then the outer ziploc.Your items will be cooler after 6 hours than they will be in the igloo.What a waste of money and space. You can buy hundreds of ziploc bags for the price, and have it be easier to carry, reusable, lighter, etc., with stay cool longer effects."
3,"Slow start, good finish","This book was difficult to get into. I almost gave up because it was s slow to start. The author had to explain how his magic would work. This made for some tedious chapters that bogged down the story.However, once the premise was set, the stories became quite interesting. The action was good and fast paced. The magic and wizards were interesting, as were the various creatures the author created.As with all series, the ending leaves you wanting a more definitive resolution to the story lines. In this book, The final battle takes place, loved ones are lost and the bad guy gets away. The story was interesting enough that I purchased the second book, The Brotherhood of the Wolf."
3,Who is my audience?,"Well, I went into the Farland series with high hopes based on the reviews. And as is the norm, the reviews must have been paid for. The story concept, in and of itself, is a bit original, but the writing....... well, let's just say that it leaves much to be desired. You can tell that the author had not thought the story out all the way and that he has absolutely no concept of time, distance, or speed. In fact, in the 2nd book in the series, a young boy with a severe leg deformity apparantly crossed over 100 miles on his own by foot in less than 2 or 3 days ! Amazing ! The pioneers will have to go back and rethink the wagon at the pace they were setting.This author reaches for the stars but misses sorely.Oh, and as to the audience? Hard to say. Parts are written for an adult and others for people much younger. You can tell by the way people ""fall in love"" without actually really having any dialogue.....but ahhh, the love is so enduring (swoon)......"
5,Unique Storyline,"I loved The Runelords, I thought it was one of the best fantasy books I have ever read. The magic system of runes and endowments is very unique. In it, people can give attributes of themselves, such as sight, hearing, or strength to another person. Once the endowment has been given, the giver looses what they gave, but the receiver can do that skill twice as well. I could use some endowments of sight for myself. All the characters were well developed in a way that really made you care about them. The descriptions of were beautiful, and the story line was intriguing. I really liked the plot. I highly recomend this great book for any fan of fantasy. David Farland has written a wonderful book that any person can easily enjoy."
5,"A wonderful, thought provoking epic fantasy.",I believe that David Farland is on his way to becoming the next Robert Jordan. This novel is supremely satisfying and entertaining.
1,Boring is not the word,"Well, plenty of my friends read this book and told me of it's greatness, so i thought why not and took a look. What can I say? The Sum of All Men was undoubtedly one of my most anticpated books, and undoubtedly THE most disappointing. While it did contain some good ideas as previous reviews have mentioned of the magic system- dedicates and so on, it's really quite uninspiring. The characterization...well... totally reeked, characters truly lacked any true development, and really in the end it's a load of ****. Half way through the book, I frankly fell asleep. Seriously, if you're looking for any real read that will keep you entertained for a good amount of time...STAY AWAY, this book's cliched characters will drive away the most dedicated fantasy reader. The good part about the novel? Thankfully, all 'good' things come to an end."
2,"alright in the begining, but fails quickly","Typical fantasy fare, though better suited to DAW publishers rather than Tor. I find this world's magic very interesting though.Watch out for this guy. His real name is Dave Wolverton, AKA The Man Who Ruined Star Wars (The Courtship of Princess Leia). He is the reason George Lucas won't do the last three Star Wars movies now. GRRRRRRRR."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Endow me please.An interesting magical ability idea in used in this series - via a rare metal and a ritual, people can donate physical abilities to someone else, strength, speed, hearing, sight, even charisma.This can even be done with animals.The feudal system is set up around this, with common people who donate abilities to their rulers being looked after in turn when they can't move, see, etc., afterwards. If dispatched, their gifts are lost, so guarding them is essential.A young prince in this setting is off to arrange a marriage, when someone who has gone overboard on the endowment thing comes calling, with his army.Therein lies the enemy they have to defeat, someone who has taken the abilities of hundreds or thousands of people. He decides he would like to be in charge of everything, and is happy to arrange this by force.3.5 outof 5"
2,Too familar,"Very poor start to a new fantasy series. Riddled with horrible cliché's such as ""Time Lords ""(how can anyone write that can get away with it after thirty years of Doctor Who?) and quasi-Arab/Indian races from hot climates. Details and description are handled in a fairy-tale kind of way in the usual medieval romantic vein, with little realism and nearly all characters beginning Princes, Kings and the like, with little mention of economics or government. The Rune Lords idea was the only sparkle in an otherwise poor showing and even then it was offered without any sense of wonder, mystery, or mystique. The ""Days"" were quite good too. It is these features which salvaged it from a one-star. Farland is going to be no match for George R R Martin, or Jordan in the future."
4,Great budget game....,"Even if many of you bought and sold this game way back @ the xbox 360 launch,it is now cheap and just as fun, go get it and get those achievement points you never earned!!"
3,boring,"could have been a good game, but too much time is wasted just running up & down corriders with nothing in them. maybe condemed 2 is better? I can never figure out why video game companies spend so much time and money on games that are just Boring"
2,smaller than expected,When I ordered this item the pictures made it look like it is the size of bubble tape. It doesnt have anything on the ad to tell you different. I got them for a school project that needed to be a certain size circle and was extremely bugged that they are soooooo tiny. ONLY 0.56oz rolls. The gum taste good but you get lots less gum than expected.
3,Handle issues,"I love the set up of the bag. It's small yet can hold a lot. My issue is, and it's a big issue, I haven't had it for long and the handle is already coming apart. The metal supports are poking through the material covering and it scrapes my hand on occasion. The handle needs to be redone. Should not be wearing through with only a couple of weeks of very light use."
3,Interesting,"The book is slow going, switching back and forth between the experiences of each twin with each situation. Haven't finished the book but, so far, gives a very good description of the ""war"" going on within the mind of the schizophrenic twin. A good read for psychiatry professionals."
4,Divided Minds,Confusing at times. Times of events. Very helpful with description of feelings of illness.
4,Finally,"I am glad to see mental illness finally being spoken of in the way it influences a family, and the hopefulness it offers when a person is able to confront their illness and succeed anyway. Very good book, not awash in sentimentality, easy to follow and a reminder of how many people in the America's suffer from this seldom talked about illness.The Spiro sisters have written a brave and informative book."
5,Excellent,"This is exactly what I have been wanting to read for years. My sister is two years older than me and suffers from 'mild' schizophrenia (undiagnosed). Showing how each girl views the same situation is exactly what I have been wanting to read. This helps validate my life experience, and my sister should read it as well to help her break denial. I couldn't put the book down."
2,Not very deep,"It took me about a month to finish this book. Most of it reads like bad fiction. It's self-consciously action-packed, as if it fears to be a boring book. But it IS!"
5,"Amazing, page turner","This book was fascinating. This illness has always interested me- to know learn about it. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in psychology, schizophrenia, of course, and/or twins. It was a page turner!BTW, here is Pam's blog if anyone who has read it wants updates. She seems to post pretty regularly.http://www.schizophrenia.com/pam/"
4,a must have for new psp owners,"i love this game. Amazing graphics, cool sounds, and alot of fun. this game is almost completly flawless. the only problem is that when you get a weapon..its kinda hard to tell what it is. i would read the instruction booklet thoroughly before doing the game. i dont know what the internet thing is like because i live an a remote area and we dont have any connections up here. im sure if you lived in a city it would work though. i love the tracks in this game...unlike any racing game ever!! thumbs up!"
3,Boring but not bad visually,"Very suprised at the graphics but the racing it self is really boring, turn left or right, pretty much all there is too it. Should have spent a little more time making it more interesting."
2,ok charger it just charges slow,"This charger is ok, but it it chargers slow. My phone also does not stay charged very long."
3,1st Voyager disc,"After hearing, and loving, the latest three Voyager albums I figured I should buy the debut album. ""Element V"" is my least favorite Voyager CD. I've only recently discovered this band and I can't get enough of them. However, there are certain songs on this disc that have the signature ""Voyager"" sound.If you're looking to check this band out for the first time, DO NOT buy this disc first! Buy any of their other releases and then, if you like those, buy this one.For fans of Pagan's Mind, Circus Maximus, Dream Theater, etc."
4,"A Solid Bionicle 8, or 9 maybe.","Cybertron Primus, interesting piece of work for sure. The quality is there, a lot of little twists and tangles, and on first opening, for an 11 year old, one of the finest toys imaginable. Still, after a couple of years of Bionicles, perhaps not the lasting value of some previous, I noticed after about three days, this was on the floor, left alone in favour of more cerebral or classic toys, and at two weeks, it is now an afterthought, replaced by Calvin and Hobbes and Wizardology. At 50 dollars a pop, I think a bit overpriced bang of buck wise, perhaps my boy is growing out of them, but I think this is overpriced for the value received, and a bit underconcepted, ergo the designers can and should do a lot better for the kids, and they should, before the boredom factor completely overtakes the product. Meanwhile, the Amazon service and shipping was faultless, these guys are really amazing."
5,fun dog toy,"This is a great toy for agressive chewes, such as pit bull or alike. Many fun hours watching my pit push and bat this ball all over the house and yard, we have had it for a few months now and have yet to see him bite any pieces off."
2,Worst Ball,This ball is no fun for my dogs and they love all kinds of balls. It is too hard and noisy. I do not recommend it.
4,Granddaughter is pleased,"My granddaughter is crazy for Tinkerbell right now and it's the theme for her 4th birthday party. This blanket is very soft and the image delightful. I know she will want to sleep with it every night--until she has a new passion, that is."
2,Not A Pythone Cable,"It wroks for the moment. But not made by Pythone and does not match the photo shown, therefore durability in doubt. Should get a refund fot not being honest."
1,Everything seems to be missing.,"I purchased this power pack for my HP Camera. The first thing I noticed was the lack of instructions in the box. There was NO paperwork included with the product. It also contained to adapter fittings, niether of which listed my camera on thier description - althoug, according to the ... Page, and the Unity Digital page, this is the exact model to use with my camera. (I did try it out after assumiing the battery would need to be charged for 12 hours like most, and tried the fitting that fit the camera. It worked right the first time, and since then it has not been able to take a picture - reads dead battery on the camera.... perhaps if I had instructions on how long to charge it.....) Overall, neat idea. I WILL try another one, but frankly, I was sadly disappointed with what I got."
1,Fails to work.,The product will not hold a charge. Will not charge the flash on my camera. This time it's going back.
5,Indeed,The product was received on the earliest shipping date given. It arrived in impeccable condition and has held up well. The guide has helped campaigns start out on the right foot. Good work!
1,Attempted destruction of a Game Concept,"Avoid at all costs - Munchkin Alert!!1 star is overly generous for this product and line - although the Alien Anthology surpasses the rest. The d20 system does NOT suit Star Wars - WEG's d6 works infinitely better. When I run or play Star Wars I do not want any shadow of D&D3; in space, which is what this inevitably gives off. The second product in the line, The Dark Side Sourcebook, confirmed my worst fears - this is intended for munchkins and twinks. Go for WEG's Star Wars - you'll enjoy your Star Wars gaming."
3,Gloves run small,"This is the second pair of this model, 145l gloves, that I have owned. This pair has been redesigned in some ways that are good, and some that aren't so great. The reinforced fingers are nice. That's where my others gave out first. The main problem I have with these is that they are quite tight, especially in the fingers. The other pair (same model number and size) that I used to have were perfect. These are too small. Will make a nice gift for one of my sons. Nice gloves, just runs small."
5,"Great Game, even better than the first!...","This game is truly one of the best games of the year next to Jedi Knight. Good characters, excellent AI, and a groovy plot make this a must have for anyone who liked the first or FPS in general."
4,NOLF 2 is a good game,This is a very fun game. The storyline is like most spy movie themes. The weapons are many and the gadgets are amusing. This is a good game if you like FPS or if you like to sneak around (you will have to use the sneak and/or run and hide method some) The game is a sort of James Bond-turned-Female spy game. I enjoy it alot. The multiplayer modes are entertaining as well. I would definatly recommend this game
1,Awful,"This game had potential, what killed it is it's incompatablity with some graphics cards. That is the trouble I found with this game, if you buy it make sure you have the correct graphics card otherwise the game will NOT work correctly. I think part 1 of the series was much better than this one."
5,Awesome fun,"Nolf 2 is one of the funniest and original games I've played this year. There is truly laugh out loud parts that make it extremely enjoyable. The tricycle and unicycle race comes to mind. I had very little technical trouble. I do have a 2 gig machine with pentium 4 and geforce4 ti4600. I probably don't have to say this but the graphics were awesome. Everything from the water and lava to the storms and tornados. Awesome. As mentioned by another reviewer, there are quite a few gadgets which I hardly ever used. I did go out of my way to try them all once anyway. Overall a very fun and visually pleasing game. One of the top action games of the year.Highly recommended."
1,Another victim of wrong format,I'm another dolt who should have listened to the other reviewers who received the UK version. I guess I trusted the product description. I'm sad because this was a gift for my brother and he has to deal with trying to exchange it.
3,Indestructible but hard and heavy on pet,"I have a german sherpard weighing in at 100 lbs as a 11 month pup.I brought the ball about 3 months ago because nothing lasted with my buddy. He bite, tore apart, poked holes in everything. I brought this ball. But we dont play with it much because he does not like the fact he cannot grab ahold of it with his mounth and it is hard and when just hitting around with feet, it hurts! Get hit with it, it hurts! Including me!. Good thought but it sits in basket now."
4,Great dog toy,My dogs are very hard on toys and this has held up great so far. they Have had it for 3 weeks and no holes yet. and it keeps them so busy that i have to pick it up when we come in or they would never come in.. they Love it...
2,Did not work,I bought this ball for my hyper lab and mixed terrier. They played with it at most for a few minutes only and now the ball is just collecting dust in the back yard. They showed no interest playing with the ball. So I can't really comment on how indestructible this ball can be.
3,Hard Ball!,"I'm only rating this ball as ""average"" because it a) wasn't clear to me at all that it is HARD plastic and HEAVY and b) I don't think of this ball as a good indoor ball. If you want a large, very hard plastic ball (this ball does NOT squish or bounce - when I say hard, I mean entirely hard, like two bowls glued together) this would be a great one for you. I bought the 10"" and it's really too heavy and hard to be much fun for my thirty pound dog (who normally loves to play with large balls) and it could damage furniture and wood floors if it really got moving. Also, unlike a softer ball, if you run into it with your foot (on purpose or accidentally) it could really hurt and it doesn't scoot out of the way like a ""normal"" ball. I think this would make a great outdoor yard ball for a large dog who likes to scoot balls around but doesn't need to pick them up. This is NOT a ball you would want to throw."
4,Keeps the pup running!,"After going through several ""inflatable"" type balls, I got this one for a five month old Austrailian cattle dog, and it is great! She will run around, pushing it with her nose, chasing it all over the yard. Because it is so hard,it is definately not for indoors play. I found that if you unscrew the ""plug"" located in the hole, you can put stones in the ball, plug it up again, and then have it make a rattle noise that the pup loves. I would have given it five stars, but it is so hard, that unless you warn people, they will try to kick it and then complain about almost breaking their toes!I want to add that after 6 months, this is still Sheba's favorite ball! We keep it in the back yard and she plays with it every single day. She will run around, pushing it with her nose and even ""scooping"" it up with her nose, while running...quite the site! When we had snow this Winter, this was the only ball we could still play with due to the size and color....just love this ball!"
5,Even my pit bull can't destroy this thing!,"Finally, I found a ball that my 90# pit bull won't be able to destroy! The biggest plus, he gets plenty of exercise as he chases it around the yard as he 'tries' to mouth it. There's absolutely NO WAY he's going to wreck this thing!"
5,Daniel Bedingfield is a virtuoso,"Listening to ""Gotta Get Thru This"" is a spiritual, romantic, passionate, and completely enjoyable experience.This is my dream album: a talented, religious artist in the secular industry who doesn't use profane language or go beyond kissing in his music. Daniel's voice is quite good. It's not the best I've heard, but you know what? That's all right. He shows real emotion...every song is clearly heartfelt. He also has a fabulous range. Not to mention the fact that Daniel wrote all of the songs on the album, and produced all but two.The music itself is fabulous. The songs range from the relaxed ballads (""If You're Not the One,"" ""Honest Questions"") to the fast-paced, hyper tunes (""Friday,"" ""Inflate My Ego"").This is a one-of-a-kind album, and I doubt that another like it will come along in a long time, with the exception of Daniel's future work.Let's just hope that Daniel doesn't allow himself to become refashioned by the industry, like many other artists."
4,Enjoyed The Dance Tracks!,"I truly enjoyed the dance tracks on Daniel Bedingfield's album from Gotta Get Thru This (one of the best songs of 2002), James Dean to Inflate My Ego. Inflate My Ego has a sample of the ""Peter Gunn Theme"" by Henry Mancini. Remember pep bands from all over playing that song at basketball games?"
3,Interesting but needs more,"I kept hearing the title track for this cd and had no idea it who it was but couldn't get the tune out of my head. Finally, I found out the artist is Daniel Bedingfield and with the current release of his album (and the reasonable price) I decided to give the cd a try. Its actually not bad...but its not great either. Besides the lead-off single, there are a couple of other interesting songs. ""Honest Questions"" reminds me of a Michael Jackson ballad (that's a compliment for those of you, who like me think poor Michael is off his rocker lately). ""James Dean (I Wanna Know)"" and ""Inflate My Ego"" are also good songs but the cd more songs like the four I've mentioned. Worth listening to but could be better."
5,MY TOWN,"This album without a doubt is the second best release from T-Roy and Eddie yet, Tatoos and Scars being the greatest. Songs that make you wanna dance and party are,""Bad For Good"" and ""Hell Yeah"". There are also songs that you listen to on a quiet night like ""Lonesome"" or ""Break My Heart Again"". Or songs where you know life is gonna get better, ""Scarecrow"". This CD has just the right blend of fun and sadness, the best qualities of an awesome country/southern rock album. It could've used a few more ""rockers"" though! Keep up the good work, COUNTRY ON!"
1,You've got to be kidding.....,"I'm open to all kinds of music out there, and like and appreciate all types of styles, but this ""duo"" needs to go back to their podunk town and polish up their voices and on-stage antics for the next dozen years. How did ""Monty"", this hurdy gurdy man with a sidekick monkey, ever score the C&W; limelight?We'll never know....but one thing's for sure: anyone can make it in this one-dimensional business. If these guys can, even a howlin' cat with a two-string banjo will find himself opening for such ""acts"" as Toby Keith.Gentry cannot sing. Pure and simple. Face it, folks, he talk-sings his tunes, and his barroom baritone voice would sound better coming from inside a corner spittoon. Pompous, pretentious lyrics, and musical stylings and guitar riffs we've heard all too many times before, just set to different lyrics.Rosanne Cash said it herslf, and I'm quoting, it's just another ""hat band....and it's shamelessly sexist""."
4,Two of mine broke,"This is the best bag holder of its kind - easy to get the bags out and very sturdy bags. However, this will be the third one I've purchased because the rubber piece that attaches to the leash has broken on the other two. I really wish they would fix this problem, because everything else is great."
2,great when it doesn't break,"i appreciate the utility of this product; however, they break and appear brittle in construction. a little super glue will hold the strap to the body of this piece (the insert point for the strap is what breaks) but who wants something new to break? i mean the two that i ordered broke nearly instantaneously."
1,Anybody else feel a bit ...disappointed?,"I got sucked into this series, despite the facile writing, the often cringe-worthy dialogue and the painfully obvious fact that many -- thank god not all -- of the castmembers couldn't act their way out of a wet paper bag (or they were directed and edited so badly that they were unable to show any talent). Through it all, I gave the writers credit that something more was going on below the veneer of arbitrary spookiness and inscrutability. The ending told me that I had been a sucker.Give a high school drama club a $50 million budget for costumes, sets and cgi, tell them to do something spooky and atmospheric, and you'd get something like this. Oh, and throw in a few really talented actors to highlight how bad everyone else is.The only dialogue I ever want to hear coming out of these writers again is, ""You want fries with that?""Sorry for the vitriole, but I just finished watching this series last night, and I wish I hadn't."
4,SHEAR DELIGHT,"IT'S TO BAD THEY HAD TO CANCEL CARNIVLE. THE VERY FIRST TIME I STARTED WATCHING IT AND WHEN IT ENDED I COULDN'T WAIT FOR THEM TO PUT THE NEXT PART ON. EXCITING, TANTALIZING. I LOVE THE ERA. IT GAVE ME A SENSE OF NORMALCY. DIDN'T LIKE SORPRANO'S WHICH LASTED LIKE FOREVER. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TOO LATE FOR HBO TO PICK UP WHERE THEY LEFT OFF WITH CARNIVALE, BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT! WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN IF THEY TOOK A HANDFUL OF THE ACTORS/ACTRESSES AND PUT SOME KIND OF ENDING TO IT! IM SO BUMMED OUT ABOUT WHAT THEY DID NOT FINSHING THE PROJECT. BUT HERE I AM BUYING ONLY THE FIRST TWO SEASONS. I LOST RESPECT FOR HBO AFTER THIS. THE GARBAGE THERE SHOWING NOW NEEDS TO BE THROWN ON THE CUTTING ROOM FLOOR AND BURNED."
5,Funny!,"Funny, funny, funny! It is a funny movie to see! Every couple should watch it! We were laughing all the way!"
2,Mediocre and hard to believe plot,"Streep is flawless as always, Baldwin is always a pleasure to watch but the plot was hard to believe. Martin was a disappointing performance, very stiff and uncomfortable with his performance. All in all the movie barely held my attention."
2,Not good,"This movie should have been very very funny considering the characaters in it,,,but it was very boring,,,sorry I bought it,,,,,"
5,It's Complicated,This movie was both funny and sad at the same time. Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin have great chemistry in it!
4,It's not complicated,I like to watch Meryl Streep in just about anything and this film is a feel good rom com done by good actors!
2,Unrealistic and Unfunny,"Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin are among my favorites.But this movie is a dog. First of all the Alec Baldwin character is as self centered and narcissistic as it gets. It's all about what he wants. Sex with his ex is hot and steamy and terrific. So to hell with his wife, to hell with his young son, and forget that the Meryl Streep character is trying to get something going with the rather sweet Steve Martin architect. It's all about him, and he clearly doesn't care about messing up several innocent people's lives. Not romantic, not comedy Also, what other reviewers are saying is correct. How is it that all the lead characters in rom coms live so lavishly? Meryl Streep sells chocolate croissants and has enough money to hire an architect to build a 3000 square foot addition to her house? When she lives there by herself? Get real. Maybe I should take up baking."
1,It's Complicated,"Thought that this was a great way to watch come movies that I had wanted to see, but missed. Paid for the movie and could never get it to download on my computer. Glad that I only spent $2.50. Great idea, but one that I won't try again."
5,Try it out!,Sometimes I need to be able to put a yoga DVD on and get my workout in. This DVD provides a great workout along with the intent to lose weight. Instructing you through the movements step by step with the right amount of explanation. Try it out!
2,Too Slow,"If you have plenty of time to listen to the instructions on this DVD, it would be acceptable. If you're under a time constraint and just need some instruction as to poses, this is not the DVD for you. The instruction is entirely too slow in explanation of moves."
2,These are for people with stick legs,"These are fine if you have skinny stick legs, but if you have an average body size for a woman, these are not big enough for your calves. They are plenty long, just impossible to get on because they are to small width wise."
3,"Great show, BUT DONT EXPECT ANYTHING MORE!","As a big fan of the fresh prince, once i heard that they were releasing previous seasons on dvd i was overjoyed..Expectations were definantly met with the first season, the episodes were great and so were the extras (cast interviews, bloopers etc.), however each season afterwards has got progressively worse in the 'extras' department, to the point where there are NO EXTRAS AT ALL in season 4. Unless you think subtitles are an extra you will be very disappointed with the lack of effort put into the dvd set of season 4.The show is still great, but i personally believe its pathetic that no extras have been put into the show.Being the series that launched Will Smith's career, you would think he would show some respect and at least give an interview about the series, but that hasn't happened in any of the four boxed sets so far."
5,A Cookbook Classic,Marcella Hazan is THE authority on Italian cooking and this cook book IS essential for cooking anything Italian. I love it.
4,It's like a text book,"This is a hefty book - lots of detail, lots of instruction and pretty strict about how things need to be done. As someone who hasn't ventured outside of my comfort zone for cooking, this structure can be very helpful - but it can also complicate things as I have to prepare everything in advance and rarely can pull off a recipe in this book with a low stocked pantry.Still, I can't fault the book for my need to prepare - overall it's great and when I do have the time to make a special trip for all the right ingredients I know I'll have everything spelled out for me. The thing is huge so it's not easy to move around a kitchen counter with a couple of fingers in the middle of cooking, but like my title indicates, it's like a text book. There's more than just recipes, there's reference information, instruction on preparation and history. A very well rounded book."
3,Italian cookbook,"This book was used and has a personal handwritten inscription on it which makes it feel like it doesn't belong to me. Other than that, it has many old, original Italian recipes that are hard to find and the reason I bought it."
2,Nature's headache,"I had ordered this tape, ""Nature's Symphony"", thinking that I would put this tape on and relax to soothing music and running streams and flowing brooks and birds chirping and scenes of mountainous country side. Well, what this tape is all about is not relaxing music and quiet scenes, all though they are a few minutes of such, but action packed scenes of antelope running accompanied by bombastic symphonic music that you are hoping will end soon. But, it doesn't! So if your looking for sounds and visions of relaxation, this is not it. Howard"
4,An Original Little Young Adult Thriller,"This book's a quick read, but well worth it. It has one of the most original storylines I've ever seen in a young adult book, or a adult book for that matter. The villian is very unqiue, and the ghost subplot is handled well. Howe's writing is much better than some of the hack stuff you see in horror books."
5,Great!!!!,I bought this because I am a fan of Clay Aiken. He is so good at reading stories and does a great job of changing his voice to suit the various characters.
1,ICK!,"This was quite possibly the most disgusting book I've ever read.None of the characters were likeable. I couldn't really root for any of them except maybe Nathan. Bobby was an idiot, Catherine was too messed up for words and caused her son to be equally messed up, and the grandparents (!).I picked this book up because I like the Survivor's Club. That wasn't exactly a children's book but this one was far too dark to be enjoyable. I finished it not so much to find out what happened as to just get the whole experience over and done. It's the first book I've ever read that made me want to take a shower after finishing it.That having been said, I still have hopes for some of Gardner's other works."
2,Slow,"I know that all the other reviewers rated this book as excellent, but for some reason, I could not get into this book.Gardner is trying to draw out her characters and I believe that she is overdoing it. She spends pages and pages in painful, boring details when all I want is action.A good example is an extremely long description about Bobby and the whole surrounding the target. She gets into minute detail even about what size amunition he takes. WHO CARES? once all of this is done - the actual shooting is done in less than 3 sentences. BORING.Unfortunately, this tone is kept throughout the entire book."
3,"good writing, bad premise","This is a well-written and suspenseful book. Unfortunately, it is based on the premise that in order to disarm a man holding a gun, the police sniper has to shoot him in the head,instead of taking out his gun hand, and/or his knees, etc. This bothered me a lot and detracted from the story. The original situation was not set up so that the sniper really HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO KILL THE MAN. If this is the way real sniper teams operate, then it is too bad for us."
2,Worst yet,Physopaths and pedofiles is just not my cuo of tea. All of the charaters are just not normal bengs. I certainly would not recommend this to anyone. I did finish the book buy can not say I liked it.
4,Alone (D.D. Warren # 1) by Lisa Gardner,"I actually read the 2nd book, Hide, in the series first. I thought Alone was interesting for a few reasons. DD Warren was such minor character in this book you wouldnt have guessed this would be a series featuring her character. We got to know Officefr Dodge in great depth, including his traumatic past. Everyone around Catherine Cagnon, a woman with a traumatic past, is being killed and Bobby Dodge is moving up the suspect list. Once Bobby sees her as a victim and not a temptress can he clear his name and keep Catherine and her son. Nathan, safe. I look forward to reading the rest of the series. This character should be of interest to those looking for a good thriller or police procedural series."
2,Gratuitous Expletives,"A fairly good novel marred by many gratuitous usages of Jesus Christ or Christ or Jesus as expletives. Authors have a large choice of words to use as expletives that would not otherwise discomfort and cause wincing among those readers, including myself, who revere and honor Jesus Christ."
2,Pretty disappointed.,"Let me start off by saying I read Lisa Gardner's' book 'Hide' before I read 'Alone' and I absolutely loved 'Hide' so it would have been hard for any book to top it. But I thought 'Alone' would come close after I read the reviews but it didn't. This book fell very flat for me. When I was reading 'Hide' I felt connected to the story. I loved the characters and the story line and it was a complete page turner. 'Alone' wasn't. I didn't like any of the characters other then Bobby and the story line didn't really interest me. After I was finished reading and I closed the book I just felt very unsatisfied. While reading this book I never felt a emotion. Never felt surprised, sad, worried for a character, or happy for a character. I kept waiting for something to happen to pull me into the book and make me start caring but it never happened. If you want an amazing book, Skip this one and go buy 'Hide'. That was one amazing book. This one, not so much."
4,I liked it.,I almost got lost in the beginning but then it started to pick up and make more sense. I guess I am just not used to this author's type of writing.The actual twist at the end could of been a bit more.. shocking? But it just made the person(s) in question seem selfish and crazy..The ending could of had a better closure but hey thats just me.
4,suspenseful,"I love Lisa Gardner's books, but why does she usually let us know who the bad guys are by putting them in so many scenes in which they do their bad guy stuff? We shouldn't have followed Mr. Bosu throughout the novel. He could have popped up at the end. That would have explained a lot, added more suspense, and the reader would have had more fun trying to figure things out. As always, well-written, with crackling dialogue."
5,Excellent,"I found this to be typical Lisa Gardner, she is an excellent writer. Keeps you looking for the guilty party and what is going to happen to them right to the end."
2,Unrealistic behavior,"I usually enjoy Lisa Gardner's books , and know a certain amount of suspension of disbelief is required, but the behavior of the protagonist Bobby is just plain unbelievable.He kills a man righteously in the line of duty and because of some obscure law is being sued criminally by the man's parents. Can such a law really exist? How would the police ever be able to do their job? The father-in-law an incredibly rich and powerful judge. Of course!So what does our hero do? He meets the widow openly in a public museum. He goes to the judge's house when beckoned, where he is offered a bribe. He goes to the wife's house when she says she hears an intruder, finding the nanny dead, hung in a blatantly fake suicide. He tells the widow the suicide is faked before he calls the police.Nope, no way i can get past all that. Especially when the wife is thoroughly unlikeable. All the women in the book are, actually."
4,The Dark Tower,"""The man in Black fled across the desert,and the gunslinger followed"". Those spellbinding words make your imagination go wild. Atleast they did for me. I personally thought about those words for a good twenty minutes. While the whole class was reading I was thinking about the book, and those words impaticular. The rest of the book is just great, and I reccomend it to anyone who hasn't had the oppurtunity to read a great book.This was my very first book read from cover to cover.Believe it or not, and it wont be the last. I've watched many of Steven King's movies and in my opinion they are good, but is books are twice as good. I really like the way he introduces characters, explains the plot, and I suggest this book to anyone."
5,STEVEN KINGS DARK TOWERS,THE BEST WORK I'VE READ LATELY KING MAKES YOU THINK YOUR ON ROLANDS JOURNY FOR THE DRAK TOWER TOO! CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE!
1,Doubful anyone cares but us.,"Well, we bought three of these monoplugs to protect our cameras from a voltage spike, like they advertize. They don't work! The male prong seems like it is the correct length, but the connector rings are not right.Anyway, we got and completed a customer satisfaction form sent to us by amazon where we didn't hear anything back about our problem. We also contacted Wein by email, and no reply. So I guess our $180.00 purchase is SOL?We have successfully bought other things through Amazon, but this is the first time we have had a problem with what we bought."
3,Interesting...,"What an...interesting DVD. I found it at...TOPS! LOL. [...] I heard about this movie on a VH1 or MTV special on Madonna. At the end, in the credits, we learn Madonna's full name. My friends took away my ""gay license"" because I didn't already know it (Madonna Louise Cicconi). You can tell this movie was independent. The audio sucks, the film is dark and grainy, as others have stated. The music is not bad, actually. The best song is what they play with the credits. This is NOT a spoiler, but the end of the film gets NASTY! Basically, Madonna plays a woman who is assaulted and gets her army of lovers to get revenge on the guy. It's only an hour long, which seems like too much at times. You get to see Madonna's [...] a few times. I had a little trouble following who was who at times. I think there were 2 guys that looked alike, not sure if it was two different guys or not. The reason I got this was because it's considered a rare item. I probably won't ever watch it again."
5,Excellent,"Excellent story, the description of the Renaissance Faire makes it seem as if you are really there. Funny scenes with the wenches. Who wouldn't love a grouchy cat named Moth. Broody hero and strong heroine, with good secondary characters. Funny insult contest. Another winner from Katie MacAlister"
2,I didn't give the other reviewers enough credit,"The other reviewers had this one correct. I kept saying out loud- Seriously?!? This is usually a genre that I enjoy, sassy heroines and heroes that take a little time to develop. I couldn't buy-in to her scenario or characters. I kept trying, but it did not ring true. Eventually I just wanted to smack some sense into most all of the characters. Too bad."
5,another Mad MacAlister book,Katie MacAlister's book are not for anything put pure pleasure. I hurt myself laughing. This is no exception. Having been to SCA events before I found she caught the whole thing perfectly!What a FUN book.
5,Great tool in a trainers toolkit!,"Whether it be for creating a training or just adding some fun to one that already exists, this book gives great ideas on how to get the audience engaged. I found the topic applications to be very helpful and the fact that these were all tested by trainers was a plus in my mind. I have already used two of them with great sucess."
2,moldy mildew mess,At the frogs feet it gets all mildewie and I can't get it clean so it isn't that great for kids with allergies.
2,Doesn't stay on spout,We have a standard spout size and this just slides off...nothing is holding it on. I loved the design since it goes with my bathroom theme...but I'd return if it I could.
2,Not my thing...,"I tried to like this video... But I just couldn't. There was a lot of talk of ""be at one with your baby"" and I couldn't do it. I know yoga is incredibly meditative and relaxing but this just wasn't doing it for me. Luckily Amazon has a great return and I got a full refund on the video."
2,Not for me.,"I bought this DVD at 26weeks for primary for the post natal, because I have Shiva Rea's DVD wich I loved a lot.But this DVD has more repetitions of poses and posing is longer than what I expected.So I got cramp every time I exercise with this DVD, and eventually I stopped using it.It's a good price but I like Shiva's DVD a lot more.(how she speaks, transitions, music, and etc...)"
2,not for beginners,"This is not a disc for a beginner, I was looking for short session but it was about 60 -70 minutes long. Although it was relaxing before the positions started to get to advanced."
2,Unclear instructions and annoying commentary,"The instructions for a lot of the more subtle movements are not explained and it is hard to just look at the woman and tell exactly how she is ""hugging her feet toward each other"" without appearing to move.I prefer simple, instructional commentary. This dvd has a little too much of the hippy dippy stuff for me. I don't find ""fill yourself and your baby with radiance"" that useful. Or to ""illuminate every cell of my body"".I found the routine itself to be pretty good, but I thought the breathing was a little slow for me and I would have liked greater variety in the poses grouped together."
2,Hard to do at 8-9 months.,"Hard to do at 8-9 months pregnant :(... At least it was for me. I have other yoga videos from Element and I liked them but I don't think that if you have morning sickness or if you're just plain too big to do some of these ""easy"" moves- you might just want to save your money for post-partum workouts."
2,Avoid in 3rd trimester!,I never leave reviews but i felt compelled after 16 minutes of doing this prenatal yoga exercise. It was very strenuous on my pregnant body (in 3rd trimester) and the poses feel rushed. I am a newbie with yoga but I have done other workouts that leave me feeling GREAT at the end. this workout exhausted me (I'm huffing and puffing as i write this)! i had to stop half way through because there was no way my body could handle these poses. There also isn't a warm up. She jumps right into the yoga. the poses are good but not for a pregnant woman!!
2,Think I may Have Expected Too Much,"Like some others, I tried this product because of Racquel Welch's book, and her passage that she uses them. I have been trying different ways of putting them on my face (ie, wearing as is, cutting them, etc., been going online to find out tips from others), but I guess I may have expected too much. The expectation was mainly because of other people loving the Frownies, I guess. I'll use up what I have, but won't buy again. Too bad. Here's the thing: I think if you could actually wear the things out in public, when you are actually making many facial expressions, these would help by limiting that. I don't think they're helping me smooth the ones already there. If anyone felt the same as me, but figured them out in the end, I would appreciate the advice."
4,i recommend this,"the only problem i found is if i out on my knees without wearing undies, it makes me itch. i tried to wash it and it still itch me. but it really keeps my knees warm. i want to give 3 star but i gave 4, because it's made in Germany :)"
3,"tedious, at times emotional","I am a great fan of Chamberlain, but found this book hard to digest. It is a compilation of his civil war letters strung together with a little back- ground information (that is mostly confusing, occasionally helpful). Most of the letters are quite boring and tactical in nature (If you find that interesting---sorry---you'll love it!) There are a few really good ones, however that can stand on their own and speak to the true character of the man. I cried twice while reading these, but at other times found myself dreading picking up the book. I'm glad I finished it---and it was worthwhile reading. Trulock is much better!"
3,"A few bright spots, but generally uninspired..","This remix of Tipsy's earlier releases is promising at times, and disappointing at others. I found some catchy hooks in the first few songs... but I fell asleep around track 5. Some of the loops eventually become monotonous. I found myself torn between surprises and boredom."
5,Fascinating book on reincarnation and group reincarnation.,If you have any interest in reincarnation or like a good detective story... read this book. The author does a great job of assembling the many regression sessions with the many people who are involved in this drama. You've got to read this book... you will not be disappointed!
1,I couldn't finish it,"I tried. I gave it till chapter 20, then I closed it up for good. I was very excited to read this, but I began to dread each turning page. I've read other books by Robert Nye and assumed I would enjoy this one too. I couldn't ""get into"" the whole realm of make believe. I found myself rolling my eyes at parts that should've been humorous. Sorry, but it wasn't for me."
3,the humor gets old,"I enjoyed this book at first - the bawdy humor, the smart-assed joking around of the story teller, the blatently embellished tales...and then it became old, and then tedious, and then boring. Humor is such a personal thing...I am sure this book is entertaining for many; however, it was no longer enjoyable to me after about 2/3. That is a disappointment after investing time in it!"
3,"""But soft, what light...""","This book is extremely difficult to review. I liked it, but I didn't enjoy it. That sounds like a contradiction, but that's as close as I can get to describing my feeling upon completing it. As a reader, I was impressed with the author's facility with language, and the way he was able to weave into his tale all types of information, relevant and irrelevant. What I missed, however, was the essense of Shakespeare, the supposed raison d'etre for the whole work! In summation: if you read to be dazzled by the writer's legerdemain with words, read the book; if you want to learn something, even a little, from what you read, don't try this one."
4,The fiction is stonger than the truth,"This book performs the admirable feat of allowing the reader to stand in the shoes of one of Shakespeare's actors (and in the case of the novel's main character--one of those players who who performed the female roles--to wear his petticoats). A tapastry of known facts and the speculations of critics and readers over the centuries since Shakespeare lived emmerse us in those ribald and interesting times when English and England were being funnelled through the mind and works of that great playwright. I get the feeling that somewhere in that forest of fact and fancy an understanding of Shakespeare and his times were to be had. I only wish the author's other novels, including Mrs. Shakespeare, were still in print. Even Amazon.com doesn't seem to list that novel about the bard's wife among the in print or out of print offerings."
5,A wonderful book,Great reading! The best (hardback) novel my kids have read for ages. It is all about the power of imagination. It is fun. It is wonderful. Read it.
4,Are You Ready For Something Weird?,"Have you ever had your room messy? I bet you have. See what happens to Wendell in Pigsty, by Mark Teague. This book is about a boy named Wendell that doesn't clean up his room. Wendell gets a big surprise. This book is so, so good because when you read it you can see the pictures in your mind. Cool, right? I like the part when Wendell makes new friends. I also like when Wendell and the new friends eat pizza. I think the message is always keep your room clean. Me too! You'll see what comes to Wendell's house by reading this book."
3,Just Ask Jesus- All God's Children,"Just Ask Jesus is a great song for children. The song's message clearly encourages children to be little messengers for the Gospel. However, purchasing this item online will leave you very disappointed! The song cuts off at the end. I purchased this on iTunes and Amazon and both times yielded the same results, the song's ending was cut off. The three star rating was not for the song but for the 'cutting' off of the song before its ending. Such a shame, it is a very good song."
1,Should have listened to feedback!!,"Knowing the very poor feedback already posted on Amazon, I still thought I would take a chance. I miscalculated! The product is pea drap green, not as what is pictured. The pieces did not fit together. There were screw holes in the face (creating leakes). The pump was SO loud you could not hear the water. Seriously... all this for an almost $500 item! I returned promptly."
3,Almost what I was looking for,"It's the right height, this one. As advertised. I have zero problems with leaks or spluttering or anything like that. The product itself is solid. Nice stone. Pretty green color. I wish it had a bit more coppery colored stone in the back, but oh well. It's varied but mostly green.One real problem with the one I got: The top ledge part with the light in it does not insert properly into the fountain lodging. This is because one of the stone inserts on the top ledge is glued on crooked. And so both stone inserts don't fit into the lodging. One goes in. So, the top sits fully crooked. I didn't want to return it for this. The shipping cost alone makes it not worth it. I plan on fixing this myself somehow one of these days.One minor problem that's subjective: It uses too much water. I had no idea this thing was going to want to drink three to four cups of distilled water every two days. If you don't keep it full, it gets noisy.Otherwise, is pretty good for the price."
1,Silver Foil Purchased from Amazon,I have purchased foil before from cake decorating supply stores and never had a problem with the thickness but I found this foil to be much thinner and you had to be very careful covering cake boards. I will never order this from you again.
3,entertaining but could be better,"The author has thoroughly researched this well-known story, and it shows in her book. I enjoyed it and would recommend it, but there will be portions that you might want to skim or skip. The most fascinating parts deal with the actual mutiny and the characters involved. Much of the book, however, deals with the aftermath, particularly the court martial of the mutineers. Readers who are well-versed on the story may appreciate that Alexander devotes much of the book to these less well-known parts of the story, but most may be frustrated by the second half of the book, which delves into such sidebars as brief biographies of the court-martial judges or the relationship between one mutineer (Peter Heywood) and his sister. I would check it out from the library, not buy it."
2,Well researched but lacking in enjoyment.,"This book was clearly well researched..It includes a plethora of information on the bounty and its sailors. However, the book can be extremely monotonous. The story also bounces around a lot making it hard to follow at times. If your looking for a narrative on the bounty this is not it, however if your a fan of the bounty story and its research interests you than this is the book for you."
3,Bounty not the best,I recently completed this book and must admit that I found it informative. My criticism is that the book seems a bit flat when all is said and done. It was good as a factual recounting and I learned much new information about the Bounty incident. That is the strength of this book but also the weakness. The characters just did not seem to come alive amid all the historical data and chronology.Compare to FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS by James Bradley. In that book there is plenty of data yet you feel as if you know each character like a good buddy or a family member. Because of this you are transported to the time and place of the story. That did not happen with this book.
4,review,This book is excellent. It reads like an adventure novel and highlights a fascinating time period. I would highly recommend it.
4,Law & Order: Dead on the Money,"This game is fun. This game makes you look and listen real good. If you like the show, you will love the game."
1,Buyer Beware,"This game is so frustrating to run that I had to return it.After checking with Legacy's own website, my computer support tech, and the video card mfr., turning off my virus protection,and turning off anything else I could think of, the game still runs so slowly I'd be better off reading a book while it grinds to the next scene. Further, the instructions are very scanty and downright unhelpful in many instances. This is a good game to avoid unless technical problems are what you really enjoy playing!"
3,Contains Adult Themes,"This book is absolutely lovely with its art and display of colors. However, and I'm not one whose mind travels to lascivious thoughts in many situations, much less reading a children's book, the color red is portrayed in en extremely sexual manner. Just something to keep in mind."
3,These routines will work,"These are great workouts. They are hard, they are mixed with different exercises and always moves. You won't get bored. I would have rated higher but the music in all three discs was so loud you have trouble hearing the cues."
1,"Running version 2.0.0.0 of the USB driver on Windows, still crashes Windows",I'm running the latest driver and it still crashes Windows XP. In my opinion Akai has done a crappy job creating the driver for Windows and probably only really tested their Mac drivers. The 2.0.0.0 drivers has a date of 2006 so they would have fixed it by now if one was coming.You can reproduce the crash by just leaving Windows up for some extended period of time - you don't even have to be doing anything to get it to crash.Now I have no choice but to throw an A/C adapter on it and use the MIDI output of the MPD16 in order to use it. Unfortunately I believe this prevents me from customizing the pads via the MPD16 utility so i'm stuck with the default MIDI notes that are sent - I have to look into this more.
2,forget the timely story - just not a great read,"Thought this book might be good. Great subject matter, great author. It just wasnt that good.I think OSC is jumping on the Tom Clancy/Dale Brown bandwagon and just cranking out terrorist stories- the kind you buy at the airport to pass the time on the plane ride. Maybe he needs the cash or is trying to get out of his contract.Paperbacks are expensive these days - buy something else."
1,"Some great books by OSC, some, like this, not so great.","Funny that a guy who says he believes what is written below, would waste his time writing a story such as this.""In a merciful society, no one, regardless of merit, is undeserving of the basic necessities of life. In a just society, no one should have the power to withhold from others those same necessities. Those whose purpose in life is the acquisition of worldly goods, and who are incapable of recognizing when they have enough, are to be pitied, not celebrated. The natural tendency of evil people toward monopoly of power is the reason for the existence of government, to level the playing field and protect the weak. But ours is a society that is becoming less just and merciful even as, in the name of justice and mercy, it is also becoming less free in matters of speech, press, and religion, while government is generally doing the opposite of its important functions."" - OSC"
1,Neo Con Dreams,"I haven't read any of Mr. Cards books, and after reading his Neo Con dream future, I won't be wasting my money on any of his other books.The First half of the book wasn't too bad, but I knew trouble was on the horizon when he used Fox news as an example of Fair and Balanced reporting, and Bill O'Rielly as a voice of reason in tv news.The George Soros character is, I imagine, what a person with Mr. Cards political views views any liberal with money who speaks against the Republican regime of the past 6 years, a threat to Cards version of Amerika.The final laughable caricature is of the Fox reporter at the news conference that ends the book, as being the only reporter who supports the military.Mr Card I would recommend you look at the election rsults of a few weeks ago to realize you and your friends vision of American isn't coming true and W and his friends won't create the Christo-Fascist regime they have been trying to achieve for the past 6 years."
2,"Nice book, but not as advertised","The work itself was excellent as most of Card's material is. The only issue is that Amazon's supply of leather bound books is not in fact the leather bound book. There were two limited edition books produced, the leather bound having an isbn number ending in 1 and the non-leather bound isbn number ending in 2. For whatever reason the plastic slipcovers that identify the book as the leather bound book have been applied to the non-leather limited edition book. This unfortunately results in a rather steep price for a book that is not leather bound. These limited edition books are autographed, but you're probably better off buying the book in its general hardback release and saving yourself money for a product that is not delivered"
4,Empire,"Great read, interesting development, realistic scenarios, draws one in and delivers. OSCard sees from both sides illustrating our need to understand each others point of view and illustrating our failure to do so can lead to mutual destruction."
1,Reads like an outline of a (very bad) book,"Wow, this is the worst book I've read in years. Cliches are everywhere, and the story is so stripped-down it feels like an outline rather than real prose."
1,Annoying right wing diatribe,"This is an annoying, poorly-written insulting right-wing diatribe masquerading as a novel. I wouldn't have bothered to write a review, but, especially if you have enjoyed other Orson Scott Card efforts, DO SKIP this one. Don't get me wrong, I've read and enjoyed many distopian, anti-intellectual, post-apocalyptic, militaristic pulp novel guilty pleasures--including more than a few survivalist types and even an Ayn Rand. THIS made me so angry I only made it 30-40 pages or so. If it hadn't been a library book I'd have thrown it at the wall. And I was then OUT of book--nothing to read that night. I NEVER quit a book--especially under those circumstances. I can read just about anything with a plot.THIS was painful and infuriating. SO GLAD I did not PAY for it! Now I don't know if I can read the sequel to Pathfinder. Very disappointed. Bad taste in my mouth.Ugh. Blech."
1,The Brain Eater Claims Another Victim,"An Ann Coulter screed thinly disguised as a science fiction novel. Proof of Louis B. Mayer's famous saying: ""If you want to send a message, call Western Union."""
1,Bias Trumps Talent,"I've enjoyed Orson Scott Card's work for many years. His Ender and Alvin Maker stories have given me hours of enjoyment. Having said this, Card's book ""Empire"" comes as an unpleasant surprise. Card is a conservative Morman and lives in a Red State so he brings a lot of excess baggage to this novel. His biased take on the current political scene has made him suspend his skills in character and plot development so this reads more like a hack job for Fox instead of a good OSC novel. Thankfully the progressives took over the country the right way. Instead of taking it by force they won the last presidential election."
5,Intriguing,"I absolutely love OSC. He is my favorite author. This book, although definitely one of his weaker ones, was rather good. I found his depictions of the civil war that we currently are in to be realistic (sans the super soldier robot things)."
2,a Card from the bottom of the deck,"I am still not quite convinced that Orson Scott Card wrote this. It seems a little too trite for him. Maybe just a hack attempt at a quick paycheck. This is perhaps the epitome of ""never judge a book by it's cover"", the cover art has absolutely nothing to do with the story. This story definitely was not firing on all cylinders."
1,Unreadable,"I only got about halfway through before I set this thing aside in disgust.I like books that have a point of view so that's certainly not my problem. No, my problem is that the author couldn't seem to decide what, exactly, his point of was. He seems so hell-bent on portraying the left and the right as equally rabid and dangerous that the book comes across as incoherent and confused. It is certainly unreadable, I only got as far into it as I did because I kept telling myself that it couldn't possibly be this bad all the way through. Wrong. Save yourself some aggravation, pass on this one."
3,Great product but slow service,"Mirrors were as advertized and were fairly easy to install, even if there were no instructions with them. The black finish is so nice there is no need to paint unless you want to match the car's color. The black looks very snappy. The seller had terrible problems, misrouted package, bogus Fed Ex number which could not be traced, delayed shipment. The order took over 2 weeks to arrive. However, we did receive an apology and a small credit to compensate for the inconvenience. Seller was in CA, but I would try to buy closer to the East coast next time for faster service."
5,HP does it again,"I have owned several printers in the past few years, mostly HP and Epson. But this HP 8450 does it all outstandingly. You do not need a computer to print photos as it has memory card reader slots for any type of card on the market today. The colors are sharp and full bodied on the 4X6's that I commonly use. If you have a digital camera with at least 3 megapixels you should not get any interpolation. The large LCD makes it easy to edit your photos right there in the printer. I own the optional duplexer in order to print regular text on both sides of a sheet of paper without removing it from the printer. All in all this is the best printer I have ever used. I don't know how HP can improve on it, but I am sure they will. By the way the 8X10's will knock your socks off....GREAT!!"
1,purchase of junk,I consider the item purchased to be an inoperable piece of junk. I would have been very happy to have never made the purchase.
2,annoying diva machine,"Jams. A lot. We picked up the 8450 a couple of years ago and it seemed to be a good deal at the time, nice features, good brand, but it's been fussy from the get-go and it's not all due to owner ignorance. Technical support is not much help either. I've given up fighting with it to try and get it to print the way it's supposed to. We can print single sheets, usually, if there's a small (but not too small) stack of paper. Too many -- and it jams. Too few -- and it jams. Given the slow pace of photo and image printing, one doesn't want to have to sit and babysit a photo printer."
2,sleeper - comparitively,"I give this two stars only in comparison to other Travis McGee novels. This one is just not up to par with the rest of the series. I haven't read all of them yet, but so far this is the only one that doesn't live up to their well deserved reputation. An education in rare postage stamps if nothing else. And the ending's pretty exciting."
5,More Carnivale!!,"Great series idea and excellently done! Very sad it only went 2 seasons. Just as I was completely hooked, it was over, leaving many more questions to be answered and mysteries to be solved. Is it possible we may see a resurection some day??"
5,Carnivale II,"Outstanding series which built on the first season. The imagery, subtlety, acting, and plot continues to be fantastic and intriguing. The first few episodes were fragmented and confusing. However, in the later episodes the fragments all came together. The whole production is so outstanding, that one could rewatch it immediately. Let's hope there is a Season III."
5,carnivale,Excellent series-too bad HBO was too cheap to at least have one more season or more. Excellent service also. Thanks
5,Great Series that Ended on a Cliffhanger,"Carnivale was a great series from HBO that only lasted two seasons (due to high production costs for this period-piece show, as well as mediocre ratings). Often low-key in style, this series will definitely ""grow on you"" - with rich characters and memorable settings. If only this series could have gone on for another few years, it may have become a classic. Don't miss this one!"
1,Nascar Illustrated,I have not received this product and delivery is 6-8 weeks. That is too long as I have already paid for the subscription. I'am not happy !
4,Nascar gossup,Nascar Illustraded is very informative. It give's great information on each driver and thier team's and is just a great way to keep up on your own driver. They also give exact detail about a race and what the outcome was during and after the race. Nascar Illustrated is just a fun magazine to read. I'd recamend it to anyone.
4,Good information,"Solid information on use of the combat/tactical shotgun. Follows the same concepts set forth in the original ""Stressfire"" handgun techniques."
5,"anna vissy, the best!","At the song paralio, anna vissy make you fill that song when you listen to it. She is very very good singer and same times I think she is going to be only the best one, with a great voice like hers."
5,Ch'an ordination of a spiritual master,"This book presents translations of early Tantras (sacred Tantric texts). In this book Odier reports that ""in the spring of 2004 in China, I met the Grand Ch'an master Jing Hui, dharma heir of Xu Yun, better known in the United States as `Empty Cloud' (1839-1959), who is recognized as the foremost Ch'an master of the twentieth century. My master Jing Hui gave me the Ch'an ordination in the Lin t'si and Caodong schools, as well as the permission to transmit the Zhao Zhou Ch'an spirit in the West."" Ch'an is Chinese Zen."
5,"Jesus, He Was Evil","It's pure delight from start to finish. The untrained ear might not take to Clay's interpretation of the Dolly Parton tune until the second or - in extreme cases - third listen, but the other five tracks are immediate, immediate, immediate. What's he singing about? Who cares? 18 minutes of musical perfection. Such a shame that it couldn't save him."
1,couldn't stand it,"don't have hardly anything good to say about this book. It's pretty vulgar, has practically no women authors, leaves out many great writers of the same generation and settles for publishing several writers/reporters that don't even live in the States. Not much information about the writers and you have to keep flipping to the back of the book to read about them. I got tired of reading the beginning stories, couldn't even finish the stupid book. Not an anthology of value."
1,The Mother of All Anthologies,"This book attempts to cover too much ground, throws over too wide a net, and catches all kind of fish. Some are dolphins that shouldn't have been killed by this compilation, some are fish that should have never been picked out of the water. Either Hispanic America deserves a better contemporary anthology, or just better writers."
4,okay for the price,"I used this on a 97 gmc sierra 5.7l, worked just fine to remove the pulley, installing it was a bit of a chore however, the pulley kept spinning with the installer which un-threads the puller part from the pump shaft even though there is a bearing there... i got it to work by coating it in Teflon spray. overall not terrible"
1,Not a good buy,"To adjust the height of the tripod, is a very difficult task. I tried doing it on a field, and I ended up feeling frustrated."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this machine to replace my 35-year old Singer Stylist and was surprised to learn that it was not as good! Of course being newer everything was a little smoother, but it has two problems that made it unacceptable to me. The first is that it requires constant - daily or weekly - oiling (my Singer only needed annual oiling) in 5 different places, some of which were not clearly indicated in the manual (brief and annoying to follow) and all of which were difficult to access. Also, pictures in the manual did not match the machine I received. The second big problem is that the it does not have a drop-in bobbin, something I thought surely would have become standard in the last 35 years! My old Singer had a drop-in bobbin and it is a feature I am not willing to give up."
2,Would not recommend!,My son has a horrible cough and his humidifier crapped out last night seeing as we live in a dry climate as it is I wanted to make sure he had one for the night. I ran to Walmart in hopes of picking up a cheap cool mist humidifier however this was all they had for under $20. I got home and set it up following all the directions and sure enough after plugging it in no steam came out. I added a bit of salt and almost instantly it began to work. It's been running for about 4 hours now and the vapor pads are already dried out and the tank was almost empty. I just refilled it and hopefully it will last until morning. I plan on returning it first thing tomorrow and buying the crane drop cool humidifier. You definitely get what you pay for!
4,"Very basic model, it works, but no frills!","It works quite well and keeps the air moist. It also makes very little noise. However, I ended up replacing it with a more expensive($49) model. Here are some of the features I would have liked.1. There is no easy way to tell how much water is left, short of popping the top off. More expensive models let you see how much water is left. This was the most annoying feature for me.2. To replace the water, you have to take the top off, set it to the side, and carry the bottom part to a water source. More expensive models let you detach a water holder and fill that.3. On switch is on the cord. It just makes me nervous handling water and reaching for the power cord.However, it does do the job! If you want more features, get a more expensive model. If not, this is a great device for the price."
1,So so,Mine is a year old and now it makes a ton of noise when it is on and half the time there is no vapor actually coming out. I have one almost exactly like it that my dad owned that still works like a charm after 15 years of use. Guess they don't make things like they used to.
5,The Blue Zone is a Winner!,The Blue Zone is a must read!! This was one I couldn't put down. Andrew Gross has a great future ahead....
5,Misinformed Consent,"Having just recently experienced problems related to turning the ""BIG"" 40, I was glad I had ""Misinformed Consent"" as my reference.It helped me to ask my physicians the right questions, and helped me make an informed decision about my course of treatment.I was fortunate that both my general physician, and gynaecologist didn't suggest a hysterectomy, unless it was a very last resort. In addition they advised me that we should exhaust all our options before even considering a hysterectomy. Perhaps they too have read Lise's book.Thank you Lise!"
3,Catholics vs Godless Atheists in post-apocalyptic NYC,"This is an odd Science Fiction novel, written in 1955 about 1964 events (the then not-so-distant future). After a war, Atheists have taken over and are persecuting Christians. Remarkably, all the Christians left seem to be Catholics. A Catholic boy roams New York looking for his parents, embracing the happy life of a priest , while fighting of the Evil Hordes. You get a few Catholics together and what is the logical outcome? They elect a Pope, of course (Our erstwhile hero)."
3,Presentation is less impressive than I imagined...,"I was hoping that this would be an impressive gift to give my boyfriend's mother, so I was counting on looks since when she receives the gift it will be all about the first impression of the package. Personally, I wasn't impressed with how it looks, but I'm hoping that the the quality of the food will make up for it."
4,Great CD,"For anyone expecting the new chevelle CD with much anticipation, like me, october 8 was great day. After hearing The Red and Wonder Whats Next before the Cd came out, i could hardly wait any longer. Well, this CD definately is a winner. While it has a polished feel to it than point # 1, you can still tell it is Chevelle, with their Jeckyll-Hide vocals, roaring distorted guitars and calm clean guitars. in my opinion, not all of the songs are of the caliber of The Red, but there are definately some that come close. My favorite tracks right now are 4,5,6,7,and 9. The others are probably just as good, but ive only had the Cd for two days, and im not used to all of them yet But to sum up, I think that all Chevelle fans will find that although this band has gotten a little more polished, it is still the emotion packed, rocking band they know. Good choice of a CD."
4,2002 vintage Chevelle convertable,"Having had the infectuous 'The Red' pump through most major rock stations over the country, Chevelle have somehow managed (through some obvious air play from Much Music USA and MTV) skip the primary and most difficult stages of becoming a bonafide rock group. Whether intentionally playing on Maynard James Keenan's (Tool) majestic vocals or not, ""Wonder what's Next"" proves to be a fine commercial debut album, which indeed is riddled with almost subliminal guitar riffs and soaring vocals. Keenan maybe kicking himself, but then again, he may just be pleased to observe what he has spawned."
3,mediocre mainstream rock,"For those with tastes on the more 'hardcore' side. The lyrics are somewhat poignant and touching, but grow old quickly. I bought this cd for the hit single ""The Red"", and then discarded it under piles of newspapers and cd cases. Months later, while in a somewhat bad mood, I enjoyed it. But in any other case than raging rampage, it's simply mediocre.It's a bit too sparse with the intelligent lyrics for my tastes. In fact, I can imagine all my steroid-filled football player comrades from high school enjoying this because of it's lack of words exceeding 4 syllables."
3,"...yup, more stupid people here...and an overrated, but decent CD...","GOD DANGIT!! Fred Durst's Numba One Fann...please save us from your idiocy...cuz it's really stinking up the joint here...to be frank, but leniant, for the last time...this album, true, is overrated, but there are some decent tracks...tracks #1-6 were my only major favorite tracks...there is better, but this isn't it...and Numba One Fann...for one last time...shut it...please"
3,Not Bad...Not Bad At All,"Okay, so maybe not all of the songs are as good as the ones in the beginning. And okay, maybe I haven't listened to it all the way through because I got bored and changed it. But just the first five tracks alone are worth buying this. ""The Red"" is the first single off the album, and with good reason, as it's one of the best songs on it. But for pure rocking sound, my favorite track is the first one, ""Family System."" It starts off the album perfectly, and the songs continue with that same pulse until about number five. The rest of the songs are good, mind you, but don't quite caputre the same level energy as ""System."""
2,don't buy it,"I am afraid the only good songs on this CD are the ones already overplayed on the radio. I am usually very picky about CD's I buy, but I made a $15 mistake on this one."
4,Christopher Seymour has guts to go this far,Christopher Seymour wrote an exciting book. He lived with the Yakuza and actually worked for the Yakuza in order to create this great piece of fun to read literature. I greatly admire him for doing this dangerous job. Everybody who wants to know about the hidden vital organs of Japanese society should read this book. Just to get an impression of how the organs work.
1,DO NOT BUY - Dangerous Product,"I bought this prodcut for my cat who had been wearing the regular plastic collar for several weeks and I felt really sorry for him.Looked great at first.However, even though it was tied so I could only get one finger between the collar and his neck, the first day he came to me with it under his arm pits. So tight he could hardly breathe.I tried again, thinking it was me. I triple checked that it was not too tight just definately not loose enough for that to happen again.I found him with the bottom half in his mouth. He had been chewing at it trying to get out.Seems like a great product. Please be extremely careful. I hate to think what would have happened if I had been out of the house when this had happened.As humans, we may think the stiff collars are ""mean"" to our animal pals but stay with them. They work and are safe."
5,Trimline Veterinary Soft Recovery Collare,I have used the Trimline Veterinary Soft Recovery Collar for my rabbits as well as my Pomeranians. It works well and is much more comfortable for them than the hard plastic collars. I would recommend the purchase of this item. It comes in several sizes and is washable! Great product.
3,It worked for a very short time,This product worked for a very short time before my cat learned how to manipulate it out of the way. She is very smart
1,Fell apart,"Put it on my Cat and he ripped it off, literally, not really meant for Cats, could work for Dogs, but very flimsy."
3,Interesting times,"The world that Louisa May Alcott lived in was amazing--personal family friends included Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, etc. Unfortunately, this isn't a terrific biography because the author falls into an ""overquoting"" pattern. Instead of making the story flow and drawing conclusions from the family's extensive journals, Saxton just endlessly quotes passages. It grew tedious. For an excellent biography that doesn't fall into this trap, check out ""Lindberg"" by A. Scott Berg."
2,Terrible,"One of the worst made hockey games I have ever seen. Anyone who watches hockey knows that the Sabres have incredible speed, but I find that even with Afinogenov I cannot win a race to any lose puck. Forget about chances at breakaways because the A.I. defense is incredibly fast. On the other hand, your defense is slow and cant check anyone. It is almost impossible to hit anyone or pokecheck the puck, so the most you can accomplish on defense is to let them take tons of shots and pray the goalie doesn't let in more than 5.The new offensive controls are very nice, but winning every game 10-8 is not what a hockey game should deliver to a person looking for some shread of defense. A.I. system is lousy; your team is very slow no matter what while players like Chara can skate circles around those like Afinogenov or Kariya. Do not spend $50 on this game."
4,One of the best hockey games I've played,"EA Sports is usually at the top for sports video games and this one holds true to that. It's a great hockey game, one of the best I've played."
5,An essential guide to networking,"55 simple steps to professional and personal success through networking.An excellent guide for the beginners of networking.

Give and you will receive.By Thei Zervaki..."
2,"Not Bad, Not Brilliant","I thought this book was going to be phenominal. And, to be fair, it started out with just the right amount of dark atmosphere and stylistic flair that I thought this book would surely be a must read. Unfortunately, after the excitement of Baer's words wear off, there isn't much actual plot to come by in this novel. Furthermore, whatever plot can be found is sometimes unexciting and hard to follow, allbeit interesting. I can say I'd recommend the first of this trilogy, Kiss Me Judas, to almost anybody, what with it's pinache and storyline. Both of these elements remain new and fresh throughout the whole book, and are the strongest they feel throughout all three of Baer's novels. However, once you get two books deep, his style and often insane plots feel more worn out than new and exciting."
3,"Ok, BUT",This is a good book and I glad I bought it. Mr Loth does a good job of covering the finanical statements in a non complicate fashion. After all acounting is not that complicated. It is only made complicated when people want to hide things.There is one MAJOR SHORTCOMING. NOTHING ABOUT THE ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK OPTIONS. This is the reason the book is only a 3 star inside of a 4 star. I guess in Mr Loth world stock options do not exist.
2,Errors and Unclear,"Throughout the text there are errors, and many things are very unclear. There are unnecessary use of big words which made it difficult to understand to some."
1,Intriguing but pointless,"The Book Waiting is pointless, the concept is intriguing, but the execution is horrible. As a mystery, well there really is none, any marginally astute reader will figure the plot out on the third or fourth page. The writer doesn't seem to care if he gets his facts straight or if his story makes sense. As a cautionary tale the writer is over wrought, children are more subtle. If this book was intended as science fiction, well better if we do not even go there."
1,"Great concept, boring story","I was excited to hear of a concept story of another species hidden among us; a similar idea was expressed in Dean Koontz' Twilight Eyes and in Stephen King's The Ten O'Clock People. I got the abridged audio version of Waiting, and was extremely bored. A very disappointing audio production. Maybe the book is better, but I found this version a waste of time."
2,Slow and implausible,"Someone who picks up a horror novel must, of course, be willing to suspend disbelief, but the concept of another race living among us and maintaining some level of cohesion as a society for 35,000 years without discovery is just a little too far-fetched. Worse than that, it's boring. Toward the end of the story, there were some twists in the plot that I didn't see coming, but by that time I didn't care anymore."
4,Very Cute Book,"I have to say,this is a cool book.I really enjoyed reading it.It felt like I was there with them and that is a good sign that it was well written.I liked the characters and how they all had a different personality.It is really easy to read.I thought the girl was a little dumb,I mean who would go on a cruise and have a fling just because she hasn't done it yet.She learns her lesson at the near end.I liked Ryan,he seemed like a nice guy and I was hoping that they would get together.You'll see at the end if they do when you read it.The only problems I had with this book was when boys were always kissing her just to get her attention and I thought""Enough with the kissing already.""and the other thing was that it ended to quickly.All in all it was a great book and I would reccomend this to anyone.This would have to be read by a 13 year old and up.I can't wait to read more of this authors books. Readinggirl"
4,I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,I thought that this was a great book! Maya had a very difficult life growing up. I just could not figure out what she really wanted with her life.
4,Great product; overall cost a bit high,"This was a gift, and the recipient loved them so much she went and bought several more! The socks are nice and thick (without being too thick) and the traction is great. The per-pair price is a bit high once you add in the shipping, but they were hard to find somewhere else. Overall, recommendeded."
2,Good Price but uncomfortable,"Worst part of the socks. Around the toe area is a sewn together ridge that can be uncomfortable across the toes. It is like the top part of the sock was just sewn to the bottom leaving a ridge. If they would fix that, I would buy again, but not as they are now."
4,helpful resource for understanding today's news,"In the introduction to the book the author states that he is neither friend nor foe of Zionism, he merely wanted to study the concept of Zionism in order to better understand it. I appreciated very much that objectivity. He took a highly emotional topic and developed a balanced, readable history of an idea. Personally, he helped me understand a little better the anti-Zionism arguement."
1,amazon not organized,I ordered it after a good wait you did not send me junkyard wars best of collection ( seven disk set ) you sent me two disk of what I did not ordered I guess you figured I would accept but I did not I had you send my money back I sent you back the wrong order and now I'm very scared to order junkyard wars best of collection ( seven disk set ) from you cause it seems if you can't complete the order you would send me what ever you wantP.S. I would like it if you call me to figure this out
3,Gingerbread book,"I wanted a book that had good ideas for me to create my own gingerbread. I used the recipe for the gingerbread and royal icing. Both worked well. As far as templates and good ideas, I would not buy this book for that."
4,Overall a good book,Gave this as a gift and the recipient's seemed to enjoy it. The true test will come next holiday season when they try to make a house!
4,Excellent catalogue of available main olive oil brands,Well presented with excellent illustrations and fair evaluation of different oils. I liked the idea of including every regional recipe next to the corresponding oil. Historical background good. A must for mediterranean food lovers
4,Light and easy,"I love this camera case. I bought it for my Canon 60D, and granted it is a VERY tight fit-- but I still like it. Lately, I have been using it for an old Canon Rebel film camera, and it is so light and easy to use that I will never go back to a regular film case. Would be nice if Zing made a slightly larger once for today's DSLRs. By the way, I love the Zing neoprene lens cases, too."
2,"For Me, A Boring Read","Try as I might, this was one book I simply could not get into. The authors obviously deserve credit for having exhaustively and meticulously researched their material, and they offer an original spin on the motives behind the mass slaughter and the identity of the assassins who committed it. For that alone, there are those who may feel it should rate at least a three-star review. My problem was the writing, which I found so dull and fragmented that I could not in all honesty give it a higher rating than I have. It's hard to believe that this was co-written by the same William J. Helmer who contributed to two of my favorite crime biographies, ""Dillinger: The Untold Story"" and ""Baby Face Nelson."""
5,Great Book,"I used this book for Data Structures and Algorithms course in computer science undergraduate curriculum. Data Abstraction and Problem solving with Java is a great introduction into the field of theoretical computer science and is very encouraging. The structure and organization of the material is great. There are virtually no misprints/mistakes in the text or problems. To be honest, this book changed my study methods for most of my other courses (not necessarily comp sci related). If you are serious about studying computer science, this book is for you."
1,one of the worst books ever,i had to buy this book because it is the book that we use in the class. i really wonder if the author himself knows whats going on in the book and in each chapter. the author probably was thinking that programming geniuses will use this book in the future. but speaking for myself im not a computer genius. go and find another book..
4,Our kid loves it.,"The best thing about this book is that it is pretty much self-teaching, and requires little or no guidance from parents, so the child can figure it out for themselves (like the Montessori method). My one-year-old daughter loves exploring the different textures and especially likes the ""sticky paint"" part.The only reason I chose 4 out of 5 stars is because it's not our daughter's very favourite book. Nevertheless, highly recommended!Kimie & Philip Sneyd"
3,Just good,Pages are not too hard... not many things to touch...Bright colours and nice drawings.It's OK.
5,Awesome toddler book!,One of the best interactive books I have purchased. My 20 month old AND my six year both love it! Violet is an adorable character and the real world objects feel authentic. Highly recommend for your child's book collection.
3,way too confusing to use,the list of all the names at the beginning was nice way to decide what we wanted more indepth info on further back into the book but when we went searching we were wishing there had been a directory to find the names. it was quite the experience. a lot of the info was extremely hokey as well. for under $5 it was a major bargain though and well worth the pain. seller also got it to me quickly which is also an A++
2,Should've beens,"This book should have been good. The story had everything, a handsome pirate, with scars, a wild untamed unique girl - she's blind - and horses. In my opinion it should have been harder to miss with story elements like that.However, the writing was heavy and hard to read lavishing on the motivations and the feelings almost trying to force the connection of soul mates. In fact, the writing and style almost seemed to place a huge neon sign above the characters head with capital letter SOULMATES. It made it hard to stomach.That and the fact that dragging off a wild girl, kidnapping her and *locking* her away inside the captain's cabin of a ship would not make the heart grow fonder.It should have been good and I should have been excited about finishing and going on to buy other stories - but all I can say is that it was barely tolerable in style and writing and characters."
4,"One of the best the Philippines has to offer,if not the best","Not your typical Filipino rock and roll band, Wolfgang exemplifies the new breed of artist from the Philippines"
2,Nothing new,There was nothing really new told during this movie that hasn't already been talked about. I would've liked to learn more about her life instead of what others thought of her.
3,2002 Kia Optima V6,This filter does its job but is not much better than the Frame Oil filter. My favorite filters is Puralator there the exact same size as the stock filter.I use them on my car and truck.
1,AN EGOMANIAC'S INTIMATE PORTRAIT,"Without a doubt, Diana Ross ""use to be"" the ultimate diva, multi-talented?... YES, honest?...NO. Don't bother getting this book, its all Diana's self glorification. Not honest at all."
4,Serene,"John Mandeville plays keyboard on all except one of the tracks on this musical compendium. Placing the word restful in the CD title is apt. Each of the 10 tracks is light, lovely, and serene. Underlying the keyboard melodies are gentle sounds of nature and extended deeper tonal notes. The selections are different enough from one another to prevent a sense of monotony from setting in. Zen Garden is a perfect, ""noninvasive"", non-cloying antidote to the stress and frazzle of daily living."
5,Truly Great!,"I have had the opportunity to see this band live in Charleston, they are one of the really great up and coming bands. Their music is truly worthy of listening to, excellent guitar and strong vocals make their band a true undiscovered adventure to listen to!"
3,Well Made - Poor Fit,This is a general complaint about lens bags of this type in general. I don't know what system they use to measure these things but they are always smaller than the stated size. I have gotten several pouches from a few different manufacturers and they all without exception mis-state the size of these bags.When they say 4.5 inches in diameter for example it's more likely to be real world 3.5 inches in diameter.This is frustrating because you buy this expecting it to be big enough for your lens with the hood installed (backwards) but there's no way it will fit and now you're left with trying to figure out what to do with that lens hood.So beware when you order these pouches.
5,For The Child Who Loves Cats (Not Just About New Siblings),"This is a book about Ginger, a lovely orange tabby who belongs to a little girl who loves him. However, she rocks Ginger's world by bringing home a new kitten, who wants to play with Ginger, eat his food, sleep in his basket, etc. Ginger takes the slightly implausible way out of going and hiding in the garden in the rain (behind the refrigerator is more like it.) But all's well that end's well, with everyone friends.This book is often pigeon-holed as the book for introducing toddlers to the idea of a baby brother or sister, but it also speaks to the cat lover in all of us. We have a cat and a 21-month old, and this book is right at the top of her list. The illustrative style is whimsical without being saccarine, and the kitten's penchant for muscling in on Ginger's food, bed, etc. is true to cats as well as babies everywhere. We both love this book, and look forward to its 101th reading. You will too."
4,Good quality set,"I have owned this set for a couple of years and has given me and my kids (6 and 4 now) a lot of fun. We ran it on a wood floor, and do have a fair share of slot cars flying around.Overall, it exceeded my expectations and is a quality product."
4,"But where's ""SATIN RED & BLACK VELVET WOMAN""????","Right after ""Alone Together"", blue Thumb issued a single called 'Satin Red & Black Velvet Woman"", which is nice as anything on the LP, and it wasn't included on the very patchy ""Headkeeper"". It's become a lost track, even tho it actually charted a week or two!What a dang shame that BGO didn't bother to fit it on this CD...which is the only reason why I haven't bought it, yet.I'm disappointed that it isn't included.Since ""Headkeeper"" is a such a patchy LP, I would've issued ""Alone Together"" with something close to the original nifty packaging and splatter CD, and included three lost Mason tracks:""Just for You"" and ""Little Woman"", issued as a solo single for UK Island and both sides features Family as the accompanying musicians. ""Just For You"" was subsequently included on ""Last Exit"", but it wasn't a Traffic track.""Satin Red & Black Velvet Woman""Then, they could've coupled ""Headkeeper"" with the also patchy ""Dave Mason & Cass Elliot"" blue Thumb LP!"
3,Not worth it,"""Master the LSAT"" is worth buying if you have never taken a practice test or if you have a lot of problems with the logic games. However, if you have problems with the other sections, this book will not help. Most studies have concluded that those that buy test prep books usually find a negligible increase in their scores. Don't pay a lot of money for a book, just do some practice questions on the internet. If you have dreams of buying a test prep book and suddenly scoring higher than you could even imagine, forget about, it's just a dream."
2,mixed feelings,"I am not sure about the effectiveness of this book... I realize the points the authors made about how to approach the problems, what to consider and what not to consider, etc. are true. But my point is there simply isn't enough time in the real test to ""think"" like the book suggests you do. I get so bogged down trying to analyze the questions that I don't have time to finish the exam.Instead, I found that working on practice exams one after another the most effective method. In retrospect, the book wasn't a help to me."
1,USELESS,Do not buy! This book is a total waste of time! I had to buy another book because this one was rambling and irrelevant.
4,Good but BIG,"Great product and has lots of useful pockets for cell phone, etc. But I took it to a conference in Seattle, and because the bag was so big, I had to bring another purse for walking around the city. This bag IS great for traveling in airports and cars with a laptop and fits nicely under the seat in airplanes."
4,Huge,This bag is huge!! I had read a couple of other reviews that stated that this bag was on the large size - well they weren't kidding!! The quality and the organizational features were great but I had to send this bag back because I was dwarfed by its size.
3,Nice bag but LARGE!,"It is a nice bag but it is super huge. I keep bumping into people with it. But at the same time, I can fit quite a bit of papers and books in it. Then, of course, the bag becomes heavy to carry which is a nuisance. I would simply say: (1) if you are looking for an everyday tote, then this is NOT the one for you b/c of its size; but (2) if you are looking for a travel bag that can carry your laptop, then it may work b/c it's sturdy."
3,Chinese Nutrition Therapy,"Chinese Nutrition Therapy is a good book for beginners, or for quick reference at a professional's desk. I recomend it."
1,Did not meet my expectations,"There are times when I dont have time to do a full workout, but I want to do SOMETHING to feel like I still accomplished some meaningful activity. I was under the impression that this DVD would make a 10 minute workout seem to just as effective as a 20-30 minute workout. I've done all of the workouts and only the yoga and ab ones are decent- not the best, but they were OK; the rest are a pure waste of time. I understand that the it's suppose to be a 10 minute workout, but that doesn't mean that it has to be rushed. I'd rather do 5 meaningful intense moves than 15 rushed, sloppy ones that will have no benefit. The only good things I can say are that all of the workouts do include a warm up and a cool down, you have the ability to mix and match your own routine, and they stick to being very close to 10 minutes. Other than that, it was a disappointment."
5,Good workout,"Amy is no joke,she gives a really good workout. She doesn't just do traditionally moves, she hits different parts of your muscles, some you wouldn't even know existanced. Sweat fest!"
1,NOT for beginners.,"Definitely not for beginners or anyone who needs instruction first. I hated it. She goes fast and you don't know what you are doing, she shows you once or maybe twice very quickly then goes into a fast routine. If you are an expert at all the moves, you may be okay. I didn't find her personality to be very congenital either."
3,Rachel,Good storylineInteresting characters with real life family situations. Well written with vivid details and description. Ready to read the rest of the series
3,falling for rachel,"i found this rather slow after reading some of nora's other books from her trilogily collection, they were a lot easyer to read"
1,Falling for Rachel (The Stanislaskis),"I wanted some light hearted reading but this book was only about, basically, sexual feelings. There was no real story so, therefore, I gave it a very low rating. I will not be buying that series again."
2,Fails in achieving goals.,"I've earned two CS degrees and worked with SNMP and TCP for years. The problem with the book is that it is written by pompus insiders. SNMP is one of the worst standards used on the internet. You could teach a course on how such a rudimentary functionality was obfuscated by impenetrable terminology and poor implementation choices (ASN1/BER for example).What is desperately needed in understanding SNMP is someone who knows what a disaster it is and tries to help bridge the terminology gaps. Unfortunately, the authors actually believe that the terminology and implementation were a good idea. They can't bring themselves to say ""You know what the rest of the world calls an array? Well, we decided to call them 'columnar objects'""The most useful part of the book was learning of the available SNMP parsers, 'smicng' and 'mosey' in an appendix. But now that I've told you, there is no reason to buy this book."
5,I love these covers,"When I'm out hiking, I'm nervous if my camera is not protected in some way from the rocks and trees. The Zing covers are light, easy to put on/take off and protect my camera."
3,"Some good points, some bad","Decent, simple recipes, reasonable variety. However, two major problems:-No prep time. An odd exclusion considering the premise of the book...-No serving sizes. See comment above.Also, it makes some nonsensical suggestions like ""If you don't have a microwave, blanch the vegetables."" If I don't even have a microwave, how in heaven's name can I be expected to have a stove and pots?"
3,Okay for true beginners,"So, I bought this book a few days ago and have tried three recipes so far. The first was a total flop. There must be an error, but be forewarned, do NOT make the Blueberry Coffee Cake as it comes out as inedible mush--WAY too much water. The other two recipes (mac and cheese and grilled cheese with tomato) were decent for quick lunches or dinners. They were average in taste, but considering the short amount of time it took to make them, I'm okay with that. All in all, it's a nice idea book to get creative with everyday ingredients, but with errors and only average taste, I give it three stars."
2,Few Recipes are Good,"I bought this book for my girlfriend for Christmas, to help each of us learn how to cook. The problem with the book is that the instructions are meant for someone that has maybe never even stepped foot in a kitchen. If you even know how to make spaghetti or hamburger helper, then this book is too simple for you. Most of the recipes turn out not to be very good, and some are just crappy. There were a few items that we have enjoyed, but we even had to modify those slightly.Overall I would say go with a different book unless you are buying it for someone who is completely clueless. Don't listen to the reviews here. Even for a notice, the mediocre meals will only discourage you from cooking. Try something else."
3,A So So Cookbook,"Even though I have been out of college for several years I ordered this cookbook through my Kindle thinking it would be perfect since I live alone and do not always feel like cooking a lot for myself. When I ordered it, I imagined the recipes would be creative healthy snacks one could cook in a non-stocked kitchen, since it is described as a dorm room cookbook. I found the recipes to be very very basic and require too many pots, pans, and utensils. I cannot imagine any dorm or college kitchen being so well stocked. I am not impressed and it was not what I was looking for."
4,Kyjen sling-go pet carrier,The only problem I have with this product is that the sides are too low and the dog can easily fall out. Other than that I really like the look and feel of the carrier.
3,There are such better Grace Hill's out there!,"Well, people really do have different opinions! This book is bland and predictable compared to so many of her books why not skip it and pick a good one!!"
4,The Unbelievable Truth,A credible author. Well written. Positions and experiences related in the book seem plausible.
4,good,product works well for what i wanted to use it for and will work for years and years at least i hope so.
2,Not impressed.,"This is the story of a young girl who questions death and the hereafter, following the passing of her grandmother. While the questions are important, the story isn't very well-written, and the conversations aren't very realistic, in my opinion. I believe that, if the book were written by an unknown writer, instead of by a Kennedy, it would still be in an editor's slush pile; possibly even in their garbage can. The book's illustrations are beautifully rendered pastels, each of them including various shades of blue, invoking heavenly feelings appropriate to the title. While death is a difficult subject for any child to deal with, I found this book to offer overly simplistic answers to complicated emotional questions. I wouldn't recommend it for a child who is seeking answers about death, or who is dealing with grief."
3,Good Portable Basketball Game,"I was looking for a basketball game with decent graphics and great gameplay. After reviewing this product online I realized that this was by far the most recommended selection for portable basketball games. Add to this fact that it's an EA Sports game I purchased it. Gameplay is fairly straightforward and the graphics are decent, but it really could use more of the Madden NFL engine to drive this game. Something is missing from the gameplahy that would make this game better. Overall, for the price and based on the few titles available, this game is ""Good"" not great."
4,GOOD WORK BUT USER UNFRIENDLY,"If you are looking for a comprehensive collection of Flannery O'Connor's works search no further. This excellent volume contains all of the best of O'Connor's writings in addition to her letters. You couldn't ask for a better resource for those who are O'Connor fans and for those who are teaching any courses about Flannery O'Connor.The major criticism that I have of this book is not content but the way it is put together. Ordinarily you would have an index in the front of the book. In this case the index is at the end and the stories are not in a systematic order to make it easier for the reader to find. I am surprised that there is not at least a one page introduction about the author to help put her work in historical perspective and introduce her to new readers. Those are the ""major"" technical flaws that I find with the book otherwise it is a must have volume to have in your personal library."
3,Blue not as pictured,"The actual blue is more of a powder or light blue, NOT the dark blue as shown. It in NO WAY matches any other blue from bar tape to tires, so buyer be ware!"
5,Top Notch book,"I for one can't imagine playing the Star Wars universe without it. I just reciently started playing using the core book and I have to say that world design is the tough part foe me. I don;t lack imagination but I like to have a little consistance from game to game and be able to create a sense of ""reality"". You know, plot continuity from the movies and all that. Without this book that would be an impossibility for me. I am not a die hard star wars fanatic so I really don't have the info on the entire universe memorized, and even though I don't know tons of facts, I find that usually my players can sense when we're just winging it. Making stuff up and it really doesn't make much fun. This books has what you're looking for. It has all the core worlds and info on each, carefully detailed and well written in a professional way. Weith plenty of NPC and plots tossed in. Just buy it. You won't go wrong."
5,love it. real corset or just piece of beauty,"have it for a year - a little bad thing - the lace is thin and I got a hole on it. But it keep your fit perfectly - you can use it even to ""not able to breath"" tight"
1,Predictable,"I find no entertainment or enjoyment in stories that involve cruelty and death to animals, particularly having lost two of my own in the past couple of years. Add this to the fact that the story was completely predictable and not a single twist came up to give it even the tiniest bit of suspense or surprise, and you're better off spending your money on Carlene Thompson or Meryl Sawyer."
4,Some flaws but it works,"I've owned five of these, bought all at the ame time, for several years. I gave them to my relatives at Christmas, kept one, and one became the favorite of my nearly blind sister. Unfortunately because of a grabby two year old niece who tore the cuckoo off the clock and finished its useful life, the clock is now in the trash heap. The only quirk three of the five had was that no matter how many times they were manually reset, they would eventually get to be 2 minutes fast - never less, never more no matter how long you let them run. The other two ran fine. After awhile the family just learned that the clock was two minutes fast and let it go. Too bad you can't orfer them now."
2,a bomb,"not nearly as in depth as i expected. a lot more could have gone into this, considering the knowledge we now posses."
4,Amazon - Secrets of The Dead World't Biggest Bomb,This is a good and educational DVD. If you are interested in learning morethis DVD is one that you should get.
2,a disapointed buyer,"This book was full of useful historical and anatomical knowledge, however the application of the techniques was poorly designed. The author could have been more practical and included photographs instead of poorly draw characters. It was extremely difficult to distinguish whether I was performing the technique properly or the author had drawn the picture poorly. However, on a positive note, the history and striking targets listed in the book were excellent. But then again, how could I practice the techniques when I had poor visual aides to assist me."
4,Stockbridge produces fine musicians!,A really catchy GOOD rock album... It's rare when you can say that a whole CD is good. Usually apart from the three of four singles of an album there aint much left and you get bored of listening to the CD because you're so tired of pressing SKIP!!! Aint so with this one.. Knocked Down is in my opinion the best song on an extremely good album. I'd only say that I wish the vocal track was a little louder over the music. Jason Fowler has an awesome voice. A group definitely primed to pick up a loyal following.
2,soft recovery collar,"Disappointed in it, very flimsy. I bought it for a cat but think it would work better for a dog."
2,Fluff,"This book is fluff, not a lot of sustenance. Menton has a lot of experience working with individuals who have experienced the loss of a loved one, but, unfortunately he does not give a lot of practical information on how to deal with ones grief. He relates many stories, but his book never gave my anything I felt I could use in helping me deal with the death of my Mother this past Christmas except that no one should tell me how long I should grieve, and that there is no wrong way to grieve. I would recommend reading it because it is a warm and fuzzy book."
4,Keeping the lawn clean,I think this is a very good product. The problem I had was in the ground here having so much clay that I was unable to dig a hole deep enough to install the product.
4,GREAT love it!,I can't tell you how happy this makes me. Now when I open my trash can lid I am not knocked over by the odor. Thanks!
3,The Showgirls of the Late '80s,"I saw this one in the theater in the late '80s. The plot and dialogue are silly: boy and girl fight and break up, girl is almost killed by a psycho at work, boy saves girl and they get back together again. Of course, the girl works in a strip club with Sandahl Bergman and a bevy of topless women who get a whole lot of screen time. If you liked Showgirls and you aren't looking for high art, you might enjoy this film."
4,Great humor book,"Enjoyed the book. Lots of great tips including several I've never heard before. Cheesy advice with a good dose of humor makes for good reading. I doubt anyone will run out after reading this and have the confidence to start stripping, but well worth checking out."
1,the same thing as cosmo mag,"This book contained the same info you would find in a cosmo. It was mostly hair, makeup beauty. It was also on confidance and likeing yourself not a problem for me.What I wanted was more physical instructions like the s factor."
2,Great Work,"I just think that this cd is so great. It has all the right sounds that you could ask for in a cd. I love the song, ""If at first you don't succeed, (Try Again) because it really shows that in this world, you really have to brush yourself off and try again, even if you don't succeed. The only way we are all going to get through life in this world is to keep trying until you reach to the place that you dream of and/or want to be. I love the words to the song because it gives me hope when I am feeling down to keep trying. I feel it is important to have music that can give you hope. That is the beauty of music. Music can help you no matter what mood you are in. I feel that music is so important to life. It is part of our culture. No number of words can describe what meaning this song has to me. I really enjoy this cd, and especially this song. I felt I had to emphasize specifically on this song. Thank you, have a good day, and god bless everyone."
2,Disappointing,"The characters were lifeless, with no depth. It was hard to finish. i just didn't care whether I finished it or not"
4,"Excellent Text, Companion questions are so-so","Having passed the OCA, I can say that this book has excellent coverage of the OCA exam (and presumably the OCP too). I wouldn't bother buying any other study material for reading. The book is very comprehensive, and the topics are broken down into small digestible chapters. If you're wondering what book you should buy to read, buy THIS ONE.My only complaints are that the question cd is not particularly helpful. The questions on it aren't particularly close to the actual exam. I would very much recommend that you buy a question set from a provider on the internet such as Ucertify (just be careful which provider you buy from, as some of them provide the *exact* test questions, which will invalidate your results. Ucertify is ok.)Also be careful: The last chapter in section 1 (the section on languages and such) is in the OCP exam, not the OCA."
4,AN ANSWER TO A PSYCHOLOGICAL PUZZLEMENT!,"Kern gives practical advice for spotting, dealing with, and preventing lapses in judgement and discipline that make a ""rogue"" aviator dangerous. This should be a must book for all pilots and aviation managers.For a perfect complement, also read Keshner's COCKPIT CONFESSIONS OF AN AIRLINE PILOT, which is fun, brilliant, and belies its title."
3,diamond earrings,The pair I received is a bit dull and grey. I expected better quality. I am considering returning them.
2,Yet another poorly transferred compilation,"There seems to be an endless run of 'new' Lucienne Delyle compilations coming on to the market. I don't know what has spurred this renewed interest in an artist who was supreme yet under-appreciated outside France, but they are all poor transfers from 78 rpm shellac records.I bought this, thinking it might be newly mastered and better than my 1997 EMI 2 disc set, but unfortunately it was not the case.It might be cheap, but the sound quality is poor. If you want to own a Lucienne Delyle CD, buy any that EMI/Pathe have released, as they own the original masters, hence the greatly superior sound.Le Meilleur de Lucienne DelyleIf pricing is all you care about, and sound doesn't matter, then this CD may do you, but I strongly recommend you check out Le Meilleur de Lucienne Delyle first."
3,"Smaller and easier to use, but hard..","This ball has good and bad points as a kickball. First the good. Catching this ball is much easier than the WAKA ball. WAKA ball stings and hurts, this one, while hard and my first thought was it would hurt like crazy, didn't really hurt at all! The rubber texture allowed for easy gripping and throwing. It's also smaller than the WAKA ball, again making gripping and throwing a breeze. On the bad side, it's hard. There were some on my newly formed adult team that hurt toes kicking this ball. I had no issues, personally, though. All in all, I personally prefered this ball to the WAKA. My team is probably split right down the middle here, though. Thus, only 3 stars. Is it possible to keep the rubber easy grip and perfect size, yet give it a bit more cushion with kick-ability, too? If that could be done, we might all be happy."
4,It's about time a product delivers what it promises,"I suffer from chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. So far I am very pleased with the results. After 1 week of taking 2 to 3 pills a day, I feel an improvement in my fatigue level. I also have noticed an increase in my focus. Yeah!!!!I have tried many, many other products that have given me no results, except maybe some jitters...yuck! So far this is helping me stay alert with no crash. It beats viewing the world from my couch, and constantly sleeping and taking naps to deal with that dawn of the dead feeling. Time will tell."
1,Shipping problems ?,"I would not recommend ordering this item unless you can wait a long time for it to be shipped. Ordered it almost two weeks ago, and every time I check on it, the shipping time frame gets moved out. If the book is back ordered and there is a problem, it would be nice if amazon was up front about it. I need this text for class and since I was counting on it from amazon, the bookstore is now sold out. If I had known there was a problem I would have paid more at the bookstore and at least been left in a lurch. I have always had good luck with amazon in the past but I must say I am exceptionally disappointed."
4,Things are moving forward,"I enjoyed this tale. The mystery was pretty good - had me guessing for quite a while, although I did figure it out well before the end. And the romance between the two lead characters is progressing slowly. I have to admit there are times when I'd like shake both of them violently and scream, ""Just wake up and see what's going on here!"" But overall I have enjoyed this entire series and look forward to reading ""The Fatal Fortune."""
5,It works,My wife and I can both work it.It is easy and does the job it is made to do.We would recommend it.
2,An item that sounded Great!!!,Has opened only about half the jars I tried it with. It pops and cracks and sounds as if it is breaking up. My wife will not use it at all.
4,Jar Opener does OPEN,"My wife and I find this product easy to use, completely reliable, and a good buy. The only reason it is not a 5 is I don't know what other products are available."
5,I've been waiting for a product like this!!,"What a great appliance! It's so easy to use and opens jars of all sizes (so far, jam, green olives, cocktail sauce, etc.) I used to save up all the jars I couldn't open for a ""strong"" friend to open. No more. [It does take away that small bit of everyday entertainment that arises when several people pass a jar back and forth trying to open it] But it's so much better and faster to just put the jar in the opener; this is one appliance that stays on the kitchen counter."
5,"Best jar opener, bar none.","We had one of these units for quite a few years until a lid became jammed in the mechanism and the resulting attempts to repair were to no avail. Could not find a replacement locally and found out that the unit was no longer being made by Black and Decker. Ran across it on Amazon and am very, very happy to have it's functionality back in the kitchen. This is singularly the best kitchen accessory one can have. It really saves your fingers and wrists. Love it, Love it."
5,Lids off Jar opener,The person who received this LOVES it.She has limited use of hands and says it works great even on baby food jars.Thanks for great product.
2,Was Great While it Lasted,I don't eat many processed foods so I probably used this about 30 times at the most. The cheap plastic gears of the can opener stripped and would no longer turn to spin the can. Very disappointed for a Black and Decker product.
1,a big disappointment,"I have arthritis in my hands, so opening jars is painful for me. We bought this as a Mother's Day gift, and it worked well about 4 times. Although it never did open large jars. Then it stopped working at all. It's bulky, takes up too much space in my kitchen -- all in all, a dead waste of time, energy, money, and space. A big, big disappointment."
4,"After seeing this talented group, I had to buy the music!","If you ever get the chance, go see The All American Boy's Chorus. They are so much more entertaining than the Vienna Boy's Choir. This CD is also great--it's like re-living the live show!"
1,Not for seasoned VB coders,"If you've been writing in VB and VBA for awhile then this book is a large waste of money. The first half of the book covers basic VB programming concepts like For Next, Do While, Select Case, Msg Box etc.... stuff I've been doing for years. The rest of the book has some okay examples, but it's not organized in a way that allows you to find what you are looking for easily."
4,Nice for what I need...,"Very easy to look up many commands with this book, and it's small making it easy to take around...Definitely not the complete reference for Dos, but no one should expect that from an ""Instant Reference."""
1,Valves don't work,"Completely useless valve design. Neither side works at all. There are plenty of valve designs that work at this size, so why waste plastic and custommer's time?"
2,There are better books on trail life,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I have read a number of other trail journals and was looking forward to this edition. I almost put it down in the first 100 pages. The trail journal entries could have done without Mr. Garvey's complaints about the poor work of VOLUNTEER trail crews in building water bars, blazes, and trail routes. I also didn't think knowing there were 15 pieces of litter on a particular section was the level of detail necessary. While this was an impressive accomplishment of one of the trail's greatest champions, the book fails to deliver in the same manner. The sections on gear needed are outdated as well. I recommend AWOL or Iron Toothpick."
1,Deeper than reason,The author thinks that you can reason alone to convince someone of the truth. This can lead to frustration. You must first bind the strongman before you can spoil his house. To think that you can reason alone leads to pride which God condemns. Thoughtful but not realistic.
2,Weather Tech winter floor mats,"I purchased these same mats from another supplier, not Amazon. They do not fit a 2008 Cadillac STS perfectly. The area around the left foot rest is curved - it needs to be square cut to lay on the floor correctly. The passenger side is also too wide, and rides up on the hump. Weather Tech verified that these were NOT specifically for the STS, but a generic set that was close."
1,My blowdryer came to me defective,My blowdryer came to me defective so I can only give it 1 star. I hear it's a great blowdryer though...too bad.
1,Horrible Hair Dryer,"I purchased this hair dryer for $200 with the T3 volumizing lotion and Orlando Pita styling brush. I have never been so disappointed in a ""salon quality"" hair dryer. I am a blow-dry addict who watches my stylist closely when he blows my hair dry. I am very good at getting a salon quality blow-out at home. I used this product for 4 months, and it is sitting in the back of a drawer now. If I wasn't so busy, I would send it back and demand a full refund. I feel like I was duped. The strength of the dryer is poor, which results in dry fly-aways. It also does not get hot enough, so after you have spent 30 minutes blowing your hair dry, it looks like it is still damp and has been blown out with a super market dryer. I have used the babyliss and solano hair dryers in the past, and am going back to them. Don't fall for the hype - this company may have a great publicist, but the product falls short."
2,Buy from a place that you can exchange easily,"I purchased this as a Christmas present and how embarrassing was it when the person I purchased it for said, ""well, I loved it until I used it the third time and when I went to take off the concentrator the whole front of the blow dryer fell apart."" I guess we'll see how ""highly rated"" this seller really is. He hasn't responded to my email still!"
3,A little disappointed,"I was a little disappointed with this book. I had just finished reading Sweet Baby by Sharon Sala (who is also Dinah McCall) and loved it so much that I decided I had to read another. This book didn't hold my interest like Sweet Baby did. I couldn't figure out the attraction to these two people and there was no spark between Gracie and Jake. I wouldn't go so far as to say it was bad, but just not as good as I expected."
5,Noble Intentions,"I really enjoyed the characters of this book. Gillian is refreshing and funny. She and Noble are a wonderful match. Some of the things Gillian gets herself into are most unbelievable, but so hilarious for a romance/mystery."
4,Bubbly As Champagne,"Noble Britton had this perfect vision of all that a wife should be. She would be demure and biddable, calmly accepting his directives in all things. His prospective bride would adhere to the strict rules of the ton as though they came naturally, never daring to enter a gentleman's club or other restricted establishment.Nonetheless, Noble found himself instantly drawn to Gillian Leigh. She was the light to his darkness in many ways. Independent and free spirited, Gillian did not balk at the secrets surrounding the demise of his first wife, nor shrink from his son, Nick, who now no longer spoke. Instead, she confronted those demons head on! Unfortunately, in the process, Gillian arouses the interest of a depraved madman, someone who will stop at nothing to kill -- and kill again. Can Noble save Gillian before the killer closes in?Fast paced and filled with humor, I romped through this book in a single day! Delightful read."
5,I Loved It!,"Noble Intentions is one of the funniest and most thoroughly entertaining books I have ever read. My husband couldn't understand why I was laughing so while reading a ""romantic novel."" Buy it, read it and be prepared to enjoy. Gillian is one of the best heroines ever. She's accident-prone, but she's honest, funny and not at all annoying like most heroines are. You'll love the scenes involving Gillian and her fire starting at balls, her blue paint disaster, the problems of trying to disembark from a small carriage while on a visit to Lord Carlisle, the Oils of Araby therapy with her husband, her exchange with pirate butler Crouch in the bedroom while Noble was asleep - I could go on and on. By all means, buy this book. I am looking forward eagerly to more of the same by author Katie MacAlister."
1,Less stars if I could...,"OMG this is awful. I love silly romantic books, but this is just way to silly even for me! This is probably the worst historical novel I have ever read. The plot is unbelievable, the reader cannot believe even for a tiny moment that the misterious Noble will fall in love with Gillian.The caracters are another disaster starting with our heroine, I'm sure the author wanted her to be the different, authentic, independent american in austere England much like Henry Jame's Isabel Archer in Portrait of a lady, but Gillian is just STUPID, she is more of a 13-year-old girl of the 21st century that somehow got stuck in this novel.I did not like this at all. Read it at your own risk."
1,Please read this review!!!!!!!!!!,"Before I give you the usual ""do not buy this book blah blah blah"" understand that I have only asked for a refund one time...most of the time I can't be bothered to try and ask for a refund when a book purchase turns out to be a mistake. But this book...Ugh...I read the sample and thought the heroine was going to be funny and outspoken. She was a complete twit. Seriously, there's this part in the book where she rescues her ""poor"" husband of 40 hours! from his mistresses bed where he was tied up naked and about to be tortured. And her ""naivete"" allows her to be unable to understand that he was going to cheat on her. I stopped reading after that. Need I say more?On a side note I was extremely interested in one of the side characters more than the two main characters. Typical."
2,Painful Read,"I was so disappointed in the book. I have not read this particular author before and made the purchase based on the reviews from others. Gillian's background from America goes nowhere. She was an annoying, inconceivably naive character that was impossible to envision ANY man, especially one as strong and ""dark"" as Noble, tolerating her. I have read characters similar to her, but they are written to be endearing... not this character. Noble, there was nothing special about him. Characters are usually built on their parentage or childhood experiences, these characters seemed to just be pasted into time with no real history and no ability for the reader to imagine their happily ever after."
3,noble intentions,"Ive only read a quarter of this book so far, sounds like the plot might be good although certainly not original. However i am seriously overwhelmed by the events that have occurred, the fights between the servants, the unfortunate incidents that have resulted inbodily harm supposedly brought on by the heroine and her extreme silliness. She comes of as just plain retarded. She overreacts toevery little thing i just wish i could shake some sense into her. The author would have us believe that there are women out there who think a mans penis is broken simply because it is flaccid, like anyone is that naive. I want to finish the book so i can know what happens to the heros 9 yr old mute son but i dont know if i can stand the nonsensical things that happen in this book. Like i said ive read a quarter of the book but ive skipped over a lotof it. Its just soo unbelieveable what happens that i cant get thru a page without saying wtf!"
2,"silly, save your time and money","I don't understand the 5 stars this book earned, which was the reason I purchased this book. I found the humor sophomoric, dog flatulence is not funny to me. The heroine was silly, she reminded me of Lucy in the ""I Love Lucy"" series. No suspense, the villain was obvious. I did read the entire book and just did not see the humor or substance the other reviewers rave about."
2,"Silly, Ridiculous Situations....Not Funny","Like others I bought this book based on the great reviews. Unfortunately, I found this book to be completely ridiculous and not funny at all. I felt like I wasted my money, and was really disappointed. I gave it two stars instead of one, because the writer is competent and can do better."
1,It was so BAD I couldn't finish it!!,"WOW! Can not believe how many good reviews this book got!! Started out OK, but then it was hard work just to make it halfway through! I NEVER quit a book, but I just couldn't force myself any longer. The main charachter makes Jessice Simpsom look smart! And the way she thinks something in her head, but accidentaly says it out loud was stupid and confusing. DO NOT waste oyur time or money!"
2,Not very computer compatible,"I bought the Easy Share 4530 and the Printer Dock 4000. The camera is great and takes beautiful pictures. The prints look very nice when printed directly from the camera to the dock. But the dock and it's software doesn't communicate with computers at all. Nothing will transfer to the computer from dock. I called tech support twice, when I got done doing all of the steps they put me through my computer wouldn't even restart. Too much trouble!! All in all, not really worth the money if you have a good printer with your computer."
2,It was OK,"I loved the look of this shoe! It was very comfy and cute. However, I did have to return it. I could not walk in it. I wobbled all over the place and fely very unstable in it. Keep in mind I have weak ankles and narrow feet so maybe that was part of it. If it had more support around the ankle I might have kept them."
5,The Prayer of Job,Great book. It really humbled me. I know who is in charge. Also realized how important it is to pray forother peoples souls.
3,screws need to be tighten every other week,"My daughter is two. She doesn't play with this that often. However, the screws need to be tighten every other week because it can get wobbly"
4,Musical treat,"Our 3 year old granddaughter loves this piano. She has already learned to play happy birthday and twinkle twinkle. She has decorated it with her favorite Disney princess stickers. The piano came in perfect condition, and within the promised time. Thank you !"
3,"Nice, but sounds terrible","The piano is very nice looking. Assembles easily. I was expecting a better sound for $115.00 though. It really sounds like an off-tune tin can. Perhaps I am expecting too much, but I did expect a decent sounding piano. I wouldn't recommend this piano."
2,It's ok.,"The best thing is, it is cute and it's red. The quality is not the greatest. Don't expect it to last forever, but it is darling."
3,Beware: Kit does not come with all parts listed,"After receiving this kit, we noticed that only 2 ""release buttons"" were included. I called Amazon and they don't have parts (which I totally expected to be the case). The rep was nice enough to send out a new kit free of charge. She also suggested I call the manufacturer to obtain new parts in the meantime. Several calls and emails later I got a message from the manufacturer basically saying ""sorry, that kit was modified a year ago to ONLY include 2 buttons, but we never updated the literature, information or photos. Sorry for the inconvenience and just return it to Amazon and they will refund your money."" This was NOT ok with me because Amazon took the hit on shipping charges TWICE now because the new kit that was on the way was obviously going to be lacking parts as well. Amazon was gracious enough to provide two kits (at no additional charge) after I explained the situation because I needed 4 buttons."
4,yellowstone,Very nice with lots of good shots of the wildlife. However there was not nearly enough of the park itself. Very short on the geyzers and hot pools. Just about nothing on yellowstone canyon. Adding this would have made it more complete.
2,Good Photography but ...,"The photography was very good, but the narration was worse than bad. In my opinion, the script, voice, and music distracted from what could have been a good piece. Trying to dramatize nature just cheapens it, giving what is inherently exciting a tranquilizing effect."
5,The Best Business Book for Personal Trainers in the USA,"Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. That is the best thing I can say to the author...This book made me focus on what was important in advanceing my business and allowing me to be a success. I now charge $70.00 per hour and avearage 5 sessions a day - 6 days a week ... and I just got started. This book is everything you need to know. Yes, it is simple to read and understand this book and unlike the lady from China (earlier review) I found it full of great advice for operating a PT business in the US. I've read the other 'newer books' and they do not compare...This guy obviously is a trainer talking to trainers. Thanks again Mr. Gaut!"
1,This book paints a very unappealing picture of marriage.,This book reveals some very dirty tactics for men wanting a divorce. After reading this book I am very glad that I am not married. These tactics are for the kind of men who do not obviously give a dam about the common good of children and women. It reveals a very ugly side of a revengeful American society and the state of marriage and family.
3,"Good Novel, Could have been better...","I like Michelle Perry's novels, but this one had me cringing at times. Dante is to be this big bad bounty hunter / bodyguard. Why then are there scenes such as him running into a door (might have been a wall or window can't remember) because he is so enthralled with the heroine? For such a great bodyguard, he sure is unobservant of his surroundings. Not to mention, her other 2 or 3 bodyguards that act more like the 3 Stooges than bodyguards. No wonder the girl gets kidnapped, all of her bodyguards are incompetent. I know you're supposed to suspend reality as it is just a novel, but this was a bit much for me."
2,A third rate history by a second rate snob,"I fail to see why the author bothered with his project- be it the ""castle"" or the book- given his low regard for the people and the place in general. I'd spent a fair amount of time in the area while growing up, and can tell you that the area has a charm that was utterly lost on the author. Don't waste your money, there are a myriad of books vastly superior to this one to be had. Just pick one at random and you'd have a better than even chance of it."
4,Great addiction,"If you're going to have an addiction, this should be it. I find myself playing for hours. Even missing some of my favorite TV shows."
1,Trojan Virus,"Purchased from Amazon Christmas 2010 and installed on computer. Virus warning popped up and game never ran. Unfortunately, we didn't uninstall from computer. 4 months later computer wiped clean of all files; pictures, music, games, etc. EVERYTHING! How could this happen with a game purchased on CD Rom from Amazon? I have read posts online of similar experiences with this product. I will not buy another Brighter Minds product."
2,AMERICA'S CRITIC,I WAS WANTED A SCARY MOVIE AND I DIDNT RECEIVE THAT WITH THIS ONE IT WAS AN OK MOVIE BAD CAMERA'S DVD QUALITY ISNT THERE ITS MORE LIKE VHS STORY WAS DECENT RENT THIS ONE NOT WORTHY OF UR MONEY!!
2,ROMANCE LIGHT,"My first Victoria Malvey book and probably my last. This is way too light weight for me. Not in the same class as Julia Quinn, Johanna Lindsey, Suzanne Enoch, Sabrina Jeffries, etc. Maybe that's an unfair comparison. Obviously from the other reviews, there is a market for romance light. I'll pass."
2,Romatic comedies are my favorite but...,I had high hopes because I really liked the actors but the movie was disappointing... I could hardly watch it to the end...I fast forwarded through most of it. Really really bad movie...
3,Funny but more of a rental than a purchase...,Enjoyed the movie but the movie just seemed a bit obvious. More of a rental than a purchase for me...
4,"Frothy, Fun and Fabulous","This is a chick flick in the truest sense of the word, but if your looking for some lighthearted, girly entertainment you won't be disappointed. Yes, it's cartoonish and farcical but very funny and if you're a shopaholic you'll definately be able to relate.Jennifer K. LaffertyAuthor of Offbeat Love Stories and More"
1,Shallow,This is in my opinion a shallow movie. No interesting story line and a predictable ending. It is only worth watching when you have nothing special to do and want to wile away the time. It is to me a Ho-Hum Drum kind of movie.
1,Not worth the money,"We love Isla Fisher of ""Definitely Maybe"" fame and selected this DVD based on her acting. To say ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" was disappointing doesn't do the whole job."
4,DELIGHTFUL,"I enjoyed Confessions of a Shopaholic. It had humor that appealed to me and was a chick-flick I could tolerate, very much like The Devil Wears Prada but not as great. It's a chick movie without being completely stupid, and I love Samantha's character and the silly lies she comes up with to cover her secret.I also love how she's a tad ditzy but still smart and educated due to her background in journalism."
3,Cute but nothing special,"I think if I had just seen this movie without knowledge of the books, I may have enjoyed it a little more. But I fell in love with the books when they first came out and the movie certainly didn't do them justice. How hard would it have been to make Becky Bloomwood British like she should have been & set the movie in London? It had its cute and funny moments.. But even Isla Fisher's great comedic timing couldn't carry this movie. Reading the books would be time better spent."
5,awesome,I really loved this movie it shows how careless we can be with our credit cards. It shows how she sacrifices everything for a friend.It also shows a really good example on how to get out of trouble without anyone loaning money. I liked that part most of all This is a very good movie.
4,Not for everyone,"I bought a used Helios X3000 at Amazon. The purchase went well and the item does what I needed, to Upscale regular movies to 1080i via a Component output (I own an older HD ready TV with no better connection than Component). It does other things such as accessing your songs, photos, and videos in your computer and showcasing them on your TV or playing them via your home stereo. It also access the internet, but in a very akward and slow way. I would stick to your PC for this last item. The drive is very noisy, and the Helios is very slow in responding to most commands from your remote, even typical movie commands such as pause and step. Being a mini pc that it is, it will behave just like one. Crashing every now and then, freezing, act crazy, etc. Nothing that a reboot will not fix. There are no updates for the software. Overall, a good item for the price I paid."
2,get what you pay for,"It fit the mattress well, but only after a week or two it is already coming apart at the seams. Luckily it still covers the mattress, so we are going to use it as long as we can."
1,mattress cover,"I was excited when I got this product, till I opened it up. It was so thin that it ripped while I was installing it. So liked the idea, but went straight into the trash. Would be great if it was made thicker. Will continue looking for what I want."
1,It's no good,"I bought this item a while ago and returned it the next day.The product is really aweful because it moves around when you sit, it deflates easily and it does not give you the right angle for maximum training. The product should be sold for about $5.00 and spending some $20 is a total rip- off! Do not buy this product. It's a waste of time and money."
4,My kids like it.,This is a pc game for children. My children (age 5 and 6) enjoy playing it. They understand the controls and have fun with it.
4,Spiderman 2 ACTIVITY CENTER -- DUGH!,"If you were dumb enough to think this was the Spiderman 2 PC game, apperently you didn't read the words ACTIVITY CENTER right on the packaging!"
2,This isn't the game,"First off, don't buy this. Spiderman 2 Activity Center isnt the spiderman 2 PC game. The Spiderman 2 PC game doesnt even appear to be listed on Amazon. Also if you are looking for the Spiderman 2 PC game don't buy it its by a different company than the company putting out the consol Spiderman 2 game. The PC game really isnt worth your money."
5,"Beam Me Up, Scotty!!",This book is a lovely tribute to a man the world has come to know and love. I recommend this book to all those fans out there who love 'Scotty' - Beam Me Up!!!
4,A Tribute to James Doohan Book,"I think that the book is very good for people who are new to Star Trek. For those, like the one who has already reviewed this book, who have been in Star Trek for a while and already know all there is to know about Star Trek, it may be boring to them. But for people new to Star Trek, it is a very good book. I recommend this book."
4,Very Good Product,This product arrived in a timely manner and in good condition. It proved to be a very good purchase.
4,Grandmother,"This product was received on time, and is enjoyed very much.However, another item that I ordered through Amazon was never received, and I am very upset by this.The order # is 058-4577311-5728538. I did write about this to the shipper and so far received no response. I now realize that this item was not an item to be shipped by Amazon, and this was my mistake. This item was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and never arrived. I would like to have a full refund for this, and never before when ordering from Amazon, did this happen. Hopefully you can remedy this for me.Thank you,Barbara Prezioso"
2,Looks can be decieving,"Ok, the picture makes the slide look bigger than you think. It's very small,and shaped fuunny, so the bottom of the slide kinda fold under, it's hard to describe, but it makes the trying to slide process hard. My daughter was as long as the slide. She started jumping off the top of the slide, and had her fun there, but no sliding down for her. This is definitely for a 1 year old, no older. My daughter was 2 at the time I got it. I went out and bought the bigger one. Now she loves that. That one get an a+"
4,"Tallest of the ""compact"" slides","Bought this slide for our 20-month old. We live in a rowhouse, so space is tight, but we have yet to fold it up because it does get daily use.This slide towers over the Little Tykes Jr. slide and is the same height as Ikea's new $150 slide. The handle bars at the top (missing from the Little Tykes slide) is a huge plus since he will climb the steps, stand up on the top step, grasp the handles, and then sit down.I definitely see our son getting 1-2 years use out of it before it is too small for his interest."
2,Not Comprehensive Enough,"This book is ok, but I wouldn't buy it again. It isn't nearly as comprehensive as I was hoping. And truthfully, none of the recipes are anything I couldn't find online, for free. I was hoping for more tips and info on pasta making, but it is just a book of decent recipes :("
3,Somewhat Hard to Understand for a Beginner,"I think this cookbook is too difficult for a novice pasta maker such as myself. It's rather hard to understand. I tried one of the sauce recipes, though, and it was great!"
1,Not The Don Winslow I Thought,"This was a mistake to buy and a mistake to read.I thought I was getting the new Don Winslow thriller, but instead got one of his S&M; novels. I've got nothing against pornography, but this vile violent treatise is awful. I'm not into it. I'm happy for those that are.I couldn't read more than 10% of it. I wanted my money back.Still do."
3,"A fast, enjoyable read","My least favorite of the series about two NOLA chefs, it is nonetheless well written with lively characters."
5,How to hear what is not being said.,"Mr. Hartley's book is a eye opening journey in how to find out what another person is communicating through non verbal cues.Whether you are intrested in building your effectiveness as a communicator, or knowing whether someone is being less than truthful with you, this is a great source of the skill sets that you need.I found that it not only gave insight on how and why business prospects behave, but also gave insight to my non verbal behavours.A must read for anyone who earns their living interacting with the public."
3,Jumpy but good information,"The information in this book is very interesting, but its hard to apply it to your own life, even in the sections committed to every day occurrences. It seemed to jump back and forth and each chapter seemed to reference another. This book would be great after a few reads to get a feel for the techniques described."
2,"look, another band to save rock and roll","please, before i read one more article about how this band is the new fugazi or the new At the drive in, seriously listen to the record the whole way through.Another band trying to hard to desperatley be the next big thing, comes off boring and trite. Why in the hell any one would waste there time jocking this british clone of every american bad indie act is beyond me...20 dollars for the import, i am not sure its worth 2 dollars"
5,My dogs love them,I order these all the time from Sit Stay. I highly recommend Sit Stay and Yummie Chummies!
3,Excellent historical novel about Chinese in the Philippines,I learn a great deal of history of the late 19th century China and the Philippines. The turmoil and struggle of the Chinese during the transitional period from the Ching dynasty to the Republic. Vivid description of the hardship of Chinese immigrant in the Philippines.
5,Very Nice,Before buying this product I read most of the reviews and almost didn't buy it because there were a number of negative reviews. I'm not sure but I suspect the variance in reviews may be related to the color or finish you select. I chose the satin nickel finish and am very pleased with it. One reviewer said the spring mechanism on the bar that holds the paper roll was plastic. Mine is an actual metal spring and it seems very substantial. The base is weighted and has a little heft to it so it seems very stable. The finish is lovely. Maybe I received a product that was produced later than some of the other holders and the company has taken these critiques to heart. I don't know for sure but this is an excellent product. I have another Toilet Paper Holder that I bought years ago in a home fix-it shop and I paid twice as much for it as I did for this. The quality is identical. I'm very pleased with my purchase.
2,Already Rusting,Inferior quality. The plating is thin and rust is coming through the finish. Inexcusable for a product that is designed for use in a humid environment.
4,It serves the purpose,"This is nice looking, matches the fixtures in my bathroom. Unlike my previous one, this one does not tip over easily."
5,Book from my childhood... passing it down to my kids,I was quite excited to find this book. It was one that my mom read to me as a child. I am so glad to find a copy in such excellent condition.
4,Apuleius: English and Latin,"The book I received had the Latin text on the left side pages and a translation in English on the right. The translation is basically one from the 1500's which has been somewhat modernized. I have seen that some of the sexy bits of the book have been toned down or omitted entirely, and this may bother some readers who like a COMPLETE work w/out censorship. Other than this slight issue I was very pleased, and the anachronistic language in the English translation was not a problem at all."
2,DO NOT BUY!!,"I must say, this game holds incredible graphics, good gameplay, and a decent story. But I was so dissapointed. First of all, it's only 6 hours long! This is not nearly enough play for a hardcore gamer or DND fan. Second, This story is decent, but not nearly deep enough for DND. And finally, you can only be three classes! If you are a hardcore DND fan, which you have to be, you might...might enjoy this game. Otherwise, get a computer and buy the real thing. Black Isle really messed up with this one...."
4,Great game.....but too short?,"Yes Baldurs Gate is a very short game. But if you play it through with all the characters then the game becomes much longer. Also some of you have forgoten about the 2 player capabilities, wich is probobly y most of the people who rented it didn't like it. Because u never had a chance to play it with 2 players. Overall this is the best Baldurs Gate i've played. I have the first one and it proved to be an impossible game. This is much easier and maybe thats y i like it. Regaurdless this game still has replay value.GREAT GRAPHICSGOOD SOUNDAWESOME CONTROLS (compared to Diablo for PSX)MAYBE TOO SHORTFUN 2 PLAYER."
4,"Rudolph, A Christmas Natural for the Season","It's adorable and will be a great addition to my ever growing Christmas decoration collections. The product though is delicate and needs to be handled and stored carefully though. I enjoy Kurt Adlers' take on so many of the cartoon characters, the Simpson's, Family Guy, Rudolph and so many others."
2,the quran women and the modern socity,thee cover on the book the quran women and the modern socity is very ugle. the book cover needs a new designer.
4,Nice for coping baseboard - cuts very well,"Could not find this 801 shaping wheel at my local big box home stores. Found it on Amazon and bought it to try coping baseboard. It cuts very well and helped me to get fairly nice joints. I know that some traditionalists would only use a coping saw, but using this is more fun."
2,He is suppose to know action right?,This book is nice to have but It just pisses me off. He blantaly does not know what he is talking about. The proof is the pictures. He has a picture of Lundgren and says its from the punisher It is not. He also has a picture of Van Damme and says its from Legionnaire buts it from street fighter lol that just gets me.
5,Excellent and Precise and so easy to understand.,I am a legal studies student and have taken Business Law I and II (online) using the Cheeseman book. The examples are clearly defined while every important phrase or word is outlined in the book. The cases in the chapters clearly demonstrate what the legal ramifications are and how it is applied. I have taken several law courses and I have found this book extremely helpful. Easy to read and never boring this book I would recommend .
4,"Solid, but big, bulky, and doesn't fit in your glove compartment","Nice roomy hardcased clamshell that can hold everything. You can even put a sandwich in it.This is more of a ""store it all case"" instead of something small (like for a mini hard drive) you can just toss in the arm rest box or glove compartment.Of course it's Case-logic and it's made quite well."
3,Buy local,Some of these will not tighten. Out of the 6 I purchased 2 didn't work properly. Not worth the hassle to return just buy from the local hardware store.
5,"Blue Grass, Hip Hop, Funky Bouncy Music","Just listen to the teaser tracks, Listen to Whiskey about 43 times...if that doesn't make you bounce, I don't want to know you. Buy the album.\/\/"
4,This Band Rocks!,"I love the Villebillies cd. I've been playing it over and over. I saw them live several years ago, and they were so exciting. I was thrilled when they finally released a cd. Hope they release another cd soon."
