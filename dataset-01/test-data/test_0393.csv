3,t could act who knew?,plot is weak but i actually enjoyed it and t was pretty cool and this is for any of his fans
2,"Loses stars because of Ninaja Rap, seriously","TMNT II wouldn't have been that bad but compared to the first, it's a big joke because the first one, it was a serious, dark and true Martial Arts film and in TMNT II, it became a cheap slapstick comedy and don't even get me started on Ninja Rap. In my opinion, as far as the Turtles phenomenon goes, this is where the Turtles ""jumped the shark"". Seriously, that was enough for me after that because it was impossible to respect them after they went that cheap.I won't deny it, this is a great movie for kids. A lot of action, dumb jokes and wise cracks, and in general, a lot of silliness. But for those of us older fans of the TMNT series, you might not be as impressed."
2,VHS transfer?,"It's nice to be able to get all four of these together in one package, however the video quality is horrible. I would swear that the source used for these movies are from a pretty bad VHS copy."
1,Fell short . . .,"My opinion doesn't seem to be very popular, but I felt that this was the worst movie of the series. I was constantly rolling my eyes when I would see the turtles fight an army of foot-soldiers and two indestructable mutants unarmed, though their weapons were (usually) strapped to their backs. And the times when they weren't carrying weapons, I wondered what they were doing going into battle without them. I would own this ONLY to have the complete collection."
1,Shredder? ...Again?,"The main reason why I didin't like this movie is because Shredder came back for a second time.That may seem pretty dumb to you,but sorry folks.I just don't get it.Warning:Spoilers Ahead. How did Shredder manage to survive being crushed in a garbage truck,but he couldn't survive a pile of wood from a falling dock,crashing down on him,when he was a HUGE ""Super"" Shredder??? That doesn't make ANY sense to me.I think they should have used a diffrent villain for this movie.I think The Ratking would have been an awesome villain choice.The storyline in this is fair,but sorry.The whole ""bringing back Shredder thing"" just ruins this movie for me."
5,TMNT 4 pack a must buy,"This is a must buy movie collection for both new and old fans alike. All except the third movie are top notch entertainment and the low price makes it affordable too. And just so you know, there is rumor of a live action reboot of the series. If that happens then the demand for this collection will go way up, so buy now while it's still cheap."
2,personal fan,This is a waste of money. It does have a little air flow but nothing that I would consider a fan. I would not recommend this item to anyone.
5,"Great, suspenseful episode",This was a great episode and I loved how they delved into the mystery surrounding Becket's mother as well as revealing more about Becket's true feelings about Castle.
3,Castle Season 2,I am sure it will be good. Had meant to order the DVD NOT the digital version. Haven't figured out how to get it to where we can watch it yet. Waiting for one of the kids to come over and show me where to find it and watch it. Sorry - we looked &found we couldn't return it so for now we are stuck.TIP look at these pages more carefully. I had ordered DVDs before and thought this page looked different - sure enuf - it was!
2,Horrible amp,"I had this amp for 2 days, and the whole time during playing the protect light would blink off and on, and then after 20 min it would stay on and shut the amp down. This amp does not put out 100x4 watts it's probably 70x4. I would not recommend this amp for any one who wants high powered highs."
1,Ground up,"I love these big cheez-its, but, the boxes I received were all ground up. At least 30% or more of the contents were ground into very small pieces, and the rest was broken up into larger pieces. The salt flaked off most of the crackers that were big enough to look at, and they had an odd taste to them.While I will buy Cheez-Its again because I do like them, I will not ever buy them over the internet again."
5,root down on this release,"the ledgendary roots crew has done it once again...delivering the most anticipated fresh and organic grooves, pleasing for the soul, good for the mind and able to move your body. Only this time, they have gone beyond my expectations and added elements with that of punk (track 3), for which I was stunned. The best part was that it faded in so flawlessly with the surrounding hip hop/r&b tracks. All the collaborating artists, the producers and the crew themselves have blasted the funkiest record of the year out of my speaker and set my mind onto another level of inspiration...thus giving me another reason to say music is the greatest fruit nature has to offer, and its roots are that of euphony."
3,Quite a dissapointment,"I have been a roots fan since things fall apart, and i have loved all of their previous albums, but this one just didn't do it for me. i though the lyrics weren't there, and i though the beats wery pretty weak as well. If wanna improve your hip hop collection, i would suggest that you buy the older roots cd's like illadelph half life or Organix, both classic roots cd's."
4,Simple and inexpensive,"Kind of flimsy looking but seems to work fine and the adjustments make it versatile.For the price,no complaints"
5,Love this Elmo!,"My daughter loves this Elmo, she carries it everywhere and sleeps with him. I would highly recommend this for any Elmo fan!"
2,Not worth it,This is a dark comedy that mocks the very nature of the Chevra Kadisha. It is ripe with corrupt characters and plot twists. A prime example of what not to do and who not to trust if one is a member of the Jewish burial society.
1,don't you dare bother!,"this is as interesting as flipping through the magazine. i have owned it for years and never look at it. it is only a compilation of old articles that appeared in threads - some useless, some helpful. there is no organization to it whatsoever. don't bother!"
4,"Ennjoyable, but not the best collection","This is a rather nice collection of short stories, if you're already a L.M. Montgomery fan, you will enjoy this. I know I did, BUT be aware of racist overtones (Tannis of the Flats) as well as some slightly sexist ones. These stories need to be read/understood within context, so should not be given to young ones to read. Definitely more of a Young Adults book than a children's one, but some of the stories are enjoyable."
2,Disappointing,"This book is essentially an expansion on several newspaper columns related to the thriving Japanese automakers and the struggling ""Big 3"". I expected to gain insight into management systems and perhaps a comparison of the methods used at various automakers to understand why honda and toyota continue to gain market share and impress their customers. Instead, the book uses quotes from sources like Edmunds and company literature to demonstrate the writer's point and really tells very little about how these companies work."
5,For all interested in business strategy..or just car freaks!,"Micheline has done an amazing amount of research, interviewing, and deep digging. This recent history of the US car market will blow your mind with the behind the scenes moves of the players in the biz. Do you own a Ford, GM or Chrysler? You should read this for the view of the future of you're favorite make. Do you drive a Japanese or European car? You should read this for the story of how they grew their US presence.The flow of the myriad of threads..US outsource..Japan builds plants in US.. Germans arrive..Chryslers new Daddy..Hyundai sorts it out..and whats likely to happen next.Great job by Micheline Maynard. This HAS to be on your car bookshelf..er business bookshelf..eh maybe even US history shelf...Nice."
2,14-Yes And 13-No,"Here's my take on this Cd sat down and listened to this and here's what i came up with.Song's i like:14I'm Available/Margie RayburnI Want To Be Happy Cha Cha/Enoch Light And The Light BrigadeShort Mort/Carole KingOh Why/The Teddy BearsThe First Sign of Love/Billy Lehman And The Penn-MenForever/The Little DippersThe Way of A Clown/Teddy RandazzoYogi/The Ivy ThreeNight Theme/The Mark llPick Me Up On Your Way Down/Pat ZillThe Last Blast of The Blasted Bugler/Sonny GianottaLittle Band of Gold/James GilreathPreacherman/Charlie RussoKick That Little Foot Sally Ann/Round RobinAs the volumes kept coming they got better after volume 2Disappointed in this cd,would recommend this mainly for curiosity seekers to see what these songs are all about."
5,The Diesel Odyssey of Clessie Cummins,"I have worked for a Cummins Engine distributor for over 37 years. This book is a very accurate account of the pains and success' of where Cummins Inc. is today. Leaders within their industry. They are a company dedicated to one thing and one thing only. ""Diesel Engines"". I would highly reccomend to anyone interested in the history of this company, ""as a must read"". Lyle's style of narrating his Father's times and developing the Cummins engine is not only interesting, but extreamly accurate. I am pleased to have been involved with this fine Company."
3,reason why these are 1/2 the price of kettler trikes,"Brought this home 3 weeks ago, used it maybe twice a week, and already the parental steering stick is broken. Radio Flyer apparently used VERY CHEAP plastic encasing around the stick. The casing has cracked completely in both spots where it was secured to the trike by metal screws. Also, the angle of the handle is too low, and I'm only 5' 2"". My son really likes the bell, though. My advice to prospective buyers would be to spend extra, buy a durable Kettler trike, and a bell as an accessory."
1,Buyer beware-- too good to be true,"I bought this tricycle for my son, who is almost three. He loves it, but it is a hazard for him to ride. The front wheel is not attached securely, and the plastic part that holds it together is either defective or poorly designed. I am writing a letter to the company complaining. Also, the plastic white part of the front wheel falls off whenever we hit a small bump in the sidewalk. If the price seems too good to be true, it really is-- save your money for better quality."
1,Radio Flyer Who???,"I like so many others, was fooled by the name Radio Flyer. Everything seemed so practical. My cousin put the bike together in about 40 minutes. But the part that attaches the wheel was slightly short, the handlebar clamp was cheap, the seat did not attach well to the bar (how can you tighten straight bolts on a curved bar?), the steering bar was a joke and my 2 1/2 year old son fell off from the the bike tilting, one too many times. Radio Flyer you should be ashamed putting something like this on the market. I am taking this bike back to Toys R Us and purchasing a Kettler Tricycle."
1,Just Say NO!!!,"I don't want to repeat what has been said already by most reviewers. Please do not waste your money. This trike is dangerous, poorly engineered, and poorly designed. Browse the stores for something else. After trashing this trike we bought a kettler. It is easier to use and has excellent engineering. However, even these can be a bit steep in price. Ironically our son has discovered our neighbors Fisher price trike for only 14.99 and loves it and wants one of his own. We are now planning on getting one this weekend. Lesson- let your child ride around on one in the store first. You just may get off cheap, but stay away from the Radio Flyer!! ;)"
4,Great tricycle! No problems yet.,"We've had our tricycle since Christmas, and I haven't had any problems yet. My toddler girl (age 2.5) is still learning how to pedal on her own, so the push bar is very handy. It seems very comfortable for her, too. I have been pretty gentle with the push bar steering mechanism, so I haven't had any problems. It is probably not the most durable tricycle out there, but it does the job, and I got it right before Christmas when they had it for a much lower price."
5,Great first tricycle!!,This tricycle is perfect for the young toddler who can't peddle yet but enjoys riding toys. All its adjustable parts grows with your child. Great purchase!
3,Too small!!,"My son tried this trike out in the store and it's a good thing he did before we bought it. He is only 2 and is short for his age and it was way too small for him. Furthermore, the seat is too small. He had a hard time staying on it without sliding off."
3,"Some good, some bad","Pros:-The parental controls work ok as long as you go slow-My 2 year old can reach the pedalsCons:-Horrible squeaking/clicking sound that we can't seem to get rid of-This bike tips very easily, you must use it on level ground-Plastic wheels don't get any traction-Super cheap bell"
2,Disappointing Quality,"The tricycle looks as nice as the expensive European brand, but the quality is quite disappointing. The headset squeaks loudly and no amount of oil seems to make it go away. The plastic bushings are cheap substitutes of a real roller bearing.The adult steering assembly is getting looser by the day. Soon, the adult will not be able to steer the tricycle. It must be a plastic steering part.Lastly the pedals keep falling off the tricycle. This is primarily because there is no metal cotter pin or retainer holding the pedal to the spindle. This pin would only cost a few cents, yet they cheaped out on it!This is quite disappointing, considering my daughter used this for two weeks. We should have known that you get what you pay for."
2,Don't Buy This Trike,"My father-in-law purchased this trike for my son not quite 2 years ago. After only moderate use for that time, the trike is now junk. The steering doesn't work, pedals are broken (they go around, but no longer turn the wheels), and as it goes it makes horrible screeching noises that no amount of WD40 will fix. We're junking it and buying the Kettler Air Navigator-- the one we liked and wanted in the first place. Moral of this story: Do your research and go with your gut. Don't be swayed by the better price tag. You'll spend more in the end!"
2,"Good idea, awful quality","I had decided to buy this based on the Radio Flyer brand, and what appeared to be a great design. Right away, I found it to be hard to steer, and it quickly developed a loud squeak that I couldn't get at with lubricant. My child had difficulty pedaling it at an age when she was able to pedal other tricycles. Eventually the pedals stopped engaging at all - they would just spin and grind, frustrating both child and parent.Since this piece of junk didn't even survive my first child's use, I'm now in the market for a decent trike for my second. It's too bad that the Radio Flyer brand is now being stamped on junk. I would consider buying their simple ""retro"" style trike for my son, but I've completely lost trust with the brand."
3,Radio Flyer Deluxe Steer & Stroll Trike,"We bought this trike for our two year old granddaughter. She is way too small for the trike but loves sitting and being pushed on it. I (and her mother) have difficulty steering the trike. My husband has to do it. If we cross a busy street one of us holds the child and the other manoeuvres the trike while crossing. If the child's feet do not rest on the pedals, they spin and the child gets hit in the shins. I also find the steering bar flimsy. It took quite some time to assemble the trike and we had to go and buy another bolt as the one that came with the trike would not properly fasten. All in all quite a disappointment. My daughter is storing the trike until the child can more readily ride it on her own."
3,Our trike review,"I was real excited to get this product. I'm not sure if we didn't put it together properly or if it's slightly 'flimsy', but it literally came apart as I was pushing it - thankfully my 2 year old wasn't riding it at the time.We'll work with it, but I was slightly disappointed."
3,Hard to put together,"I was very excited to get this tricycle for my daughter, but once I start to put together I regret it, the instructions were really poor written and took me and my husband more than 2 hours to put it together.The Trike is very cute and my daughter like it, but I would rather had bought a second hand one than trying to put it together again."
3,spring for the kettler,"My third boy got this trike for his second birthday. The parental steering handle was broken within a week. We returned it only to have the same thing happen to the replacement. At this point we gave up. At two and a half years, he can move along pretty well by himself now (on a hand-me-down bike), but the trike is ready for the landfill. Don't bother."
1,THIS TRIKE NEEDS TO BE RECALLED!,"Bad steering, top heavy, not what I expected. I won't be buying another trike from Radio Flyer!"
2,Don't buy this trike!,"I bought this for my 2 year-old son and it was a nightmare to put together first of all. Certain parts did not fit together easily and it is just a poor design. Then, after all the hard work to assemble it, the steering mechanism was broken! The handle bars don't lock and the footrest is in the most obscure area---it doesn't make any sense! Poor craftmanship, poor design, poor quality!!!"
4,Not Free SF Reader,"This was quite a well handled explanation of what happens as you get close to light speed. Bits of this might even be useful in high school physics, perhaps! Well handled, although whether a crew would get that overwrought that fast, who knows. I suppose he had to throw in a bit of character conflict though, as things get pretty wild due to the speed they are travelling at. Do they try and stop, or not?"
2,"Thought provoking, yet lacking as a novel.","Ok, first of all, I was stunned at the end of this book. I mean conceptually it cancels out my worst thoughts of despair in that anything created artistically will never last as the sun explodes and the universe crawls in on itself. With the technologically advanced star ship Leonora Christine humans could effectively become God as they live through the contractions of an oscillating universe. All data from earths history could be stored on a fleet of ships at certain points in a universes time line and set off to re-establish in the next form the universe takes. Although masterworks completed after the ships leave would perish. What would human music sound like after say 1000 osculations?But alas the book itself reads like a hypothecital lecture by a science fiction buff. Clumsy characters, and poor movitivations of characters. Nevertheless a damn interesting read."
3,Godslayer,"Once again Reichert does an outstanding job of storytelling. She has an ability to bring readers to to another world where anything is possible. However, this one is a little far-fetched. The story and the characters were totally unbelievable and not well developed. After reading Nightfall, I was greatly disappointed. But, Reichert forces readers to open their minds and really think about war and how the ""family man"" in all of us can be transformed into someone we find very hard to live with. Luckily for Al Larson there is a ""God"" that protected him and allowed him to carry on, even if it was in another world. This story line was a great tribute to all of those young men who served in Vietnam."
3,One of the better dance aerobic videos,"I really enjoy dancing and am not an aerobic fan so I thought this was great motivation. And it is, sort of. This dance routine is pretty fun, a much better one than the dance club aerobics one. But you don't get much of a sweat, I mean do you really need a full 10 minutes to warm up and another 10 to cool down? Needless to say, this went in the trash shortly after. I like a more intense heart rate level like speed jump roping the way boxers do. I would recommend this to those who desire a beginner/intermediate level of aerobics because it is fun and would keep your interest. But, if you really want to push yourself, speed rope. I swear it melts cellulite off your thighs!"
3,A great read start to finish,"A smaller, simpler, more accurate, and infinately kinder book than Alan Schom's attempt at destroying the myth of Napoleon.I bought this book many years ago at the Waterloo battlefield, and it has remained with me since. Not a large book as biographies go, but full of wonderful observations and insights. Well worth buying."
2,No es el mismo concierto grabado en los cd's...,"Felicito a Ednita por la gran calidad de sus dos CD's Acusticos. Tengo ambos y los considero de lo mejor de conciertos acusticos grabados hasta el momento. Lo que si no me parece que es promocionen este DVD como el mismo concierto si NO lo es.El concierto grabado en este DVD corresponde a un masivo que realizo Ednita como promocion de los CD's Acusticos, que segun sus propias palabras, no esperaba el exito obtenido. Esta situacion resulta en un engaño a sus seguidores, ya que compramos algo que no era, incluso la portada del DVD no corresponde al concierto que contiene, sino al grabado en los CD's. Me hubiera gustado que se vendiera en DVD la misma sesion de grabacion de los CD's, y no otra cosa, que si bien, es tambien de calidad, no se iguala con la altamente alcanzada en los CD's. Sugerencia para Ednita: tus fans de tantos años no nos merecemos este tipo de engaños publicitarios para comprar tu música, así que no permitas que este pase. Gracias"
3,Glad to find it instock but it's really small!,"With only three days to go before the holiday, I was desperately trying to find a hardcover version of this book for my son's Christmas present and was thrilled that Amazon had it instock. I should have paid closer attention to the description, though, as the book is really the size of a small paperback book with a hardcover around it. Needless to say I was taken aback having expected a regular hardcover book. My son doesn't seem to mind, which is great, but I thought I'd point it out for anyone else that might be buying it."
4,Superb Adventure!!,"Wow, what a fantastic adventure. I was a little skeptical to read it as the cover didn't seem very interesting, but after I started reading Airborn, I was enthusiatically entralled. Airborn brings together the ideas of Treasure Island and Treasure Planet for a gripping adventure. The descriptive, vivid writing of Kenneth Oppel makes the reader feel they are there expereincing all the ups and downs of the characters. I enjoyed accompanying Matt and Kate aboard the airship, Aurora, as they search for an uncharted species that Kate's grandfather had briefly documented before he died aboard a hotair balloon. Pirates, a shipwreck, a typhoon, jumping snakes, and a beautiful yet deadly uncharted species makes the book hard to put down. Bravo Mr. Oppel! Well done!"
3,Dedicated this book to a library,"It is ok if you are planning on reading some fabricated stories, but it is just no good for research, which is why I originally bought this book. I wouldn't spend more then a dollar on it. I originally bought this to help write my paper on witches in the middle ages, but found this book to be completely useless and packed full what felt like fabrication stories based in the middle ages. It didn't even feel like the context was right on some of them. I would have preferred a book that went into details, accounts, or even just presented the air of the mind of someone in the middle ages. If you are looking for short stories kinda told form the way of the middle ages this is your book but if you want an better historical context, or facts, don't get this book. I donated it to our library, I don't think I'd ever wan to read it again."
3,Not to impressed,Very Biased view. Seems to be obsessed with Gnosticism. Contains a lot of writings but are only parts of the writings. If you are interested in studying the writings buy just a translation of the work.
2,Blasphemy,"While there are books in here that could well have been omitted from the original texts of God's word there are books that are totally man agnostic opinionated that contradict that Jesus and His mother did not sin. It claims that Jesus as a child would turn other children into other animals because He did not like what they said. Yes Jesus came to earth as a human, But, He never sinned! Nor was He vindictive. It goes against everything He was put on earth to do. That is not to say he I'd not get angry, He did. He loved but knew right from wrong and acted like the Son of God, not a spoiled brat. Shame on Willis Barnstone for including such trash in such a text. Obviously, Mr. Barnstone failed to read the real bible, because even a child would know that the two texts don't match up."
2,customer service,"Product works well, however customer service has een VERY POOR. Headset slider slips out of track. Unusable. Have been unsuccessful in trying since 1/12/07 to return/exchange product. Company does not respond. Amazon does not respond. Lesson learned. I'm stuck with this inferior product but will NEVER purchase electonics on-line. Learn from my mistake."
2,Beaware of the clicking sound,"I also get a clicking sound in the left side of the phones. Very, very annoying. Sometimes, even the right side has the same problem. Without the clicking sound, the sound quality is fine. Small motion can also cause annoying noise from the plastic joint part. Overall, I think it's fair if it's $50."
2,Bosch Planer Blades,"Bosch PA1202 Pair of Woodrazor Tungsten Carbide Planer BladesI purchased these Blades to use with my hand held Metabo Planer. I orderd 3 units (it comes in pairs)I only recieved 2 units packed in one flat cardboard. The packaging seemed to be intact and the shipping advise informed me that the whole order will be sent in one shipment.I was billed for the 3 pairs. I do not wish to get the missing pair but will be happy to get the crdit for my next purchase on Amazon.As to the quality of the product, I can not comment on it as I have not use them yet.Futher more I am writing this compaint here becouse I could not get back to Amazon about it."
4,Planer Blades,A good price for quality planer blades for the Bosch 1594K planer. I bought these as spares and haven't had a chance to actually use them yet but expect them to perform well.
4,Works as described,"I was a alittle skeptical about this product at first but I figured, might as well. Works like it said it would and so far no problems at all. My only gripe is that the port where you plug in your toslink cable is not snug enough. The cable can pop right off without any effort whatsoever. But, given that you mount it correctly and not let it dangle it's not a big issue at all. Overall, I'm happy, at least it saved me from buying another reciever."
2,"Did as advertised, then stopped working","The box works just fine for me, don't know what people are complaining about (I do, but that's the wrong use vs. malfunction of the product).It does look and feel cheap, I must admit, but it does the job. The Toslink sits tight, so does the Coax. I am not fearing the issues some have addressed of cables going lose. Also, so far I have no had any reboots that were required - knocking on wood AND crossing my fingers.Overall, great addition for the money you pay to get your older 5.1 receiver working together with your newer Cable box/BluRay player. Finally!Addition: about 2 weeks in the product just stopped working. I checked all cables, made sure it was connected properly, unplugged and plugged it back in: Nothing.That's why I changed my review from 5* to 2*."
4,Great solution!,Great solution for converting coaxil digital output to optical input. I can hear a blasting sound now to my tv from home theater system.
1,Waste of money:,It was a waste of money as it didn't work at all. I had to end up buying a new surround sound system and now I'm out the money for this converter as well as the digital optical cable and the digital coaxial cable. My new tv has the digital optical out and my old surround sound system had digital coaxial in so everyone told me this was what I needed to be able to keep my old system as we really liked it as it was a multi disc player as well. But this didn't work at all you could hear it trying to work but I think it's defective it would make a humming noise every once in awhile but not produce any real sound. And yes I set my surround sound system to the digital in setting so it could receive the signal.
1,"Works, not too thrilled tho..","Yes, works as described. Sound quality suffers big time. If at all you can avoid buying it, please do."
5,Works!,"Well, I bought it and set it up and bam, works! What else you need to know? Only if it will last...I will update this if anything happens. But for now, I am happy listening to my music and movies on my receiver thanks to this."
1,Sounds pops in and out intermittently,"It works, but at random moments (approximately once or twice an hour during continuous playback), the sound will go out for a second and then go back on again. Find a different brand."
3,needs to be updated,Helpful book but some stuff has changed (as it does with hockey) so some info is dated. The copy I had was published in 1999. An updated edition would be helpful.
3,its ok,its a good controller works like the regular ones only problems is that you ahve to keep buying batteries over and over again
2,Not Very Good,"I am a huge fan of surrealism, but these three movies pale in comparison to to some of the work of Arrabal's contemporaries. The images are interesting (at times), but the plots are boring and filled with pseudo-political massages and personal frustrations from what seem likes millenia ago. These 3 movies haven't aged well. I was disappointed by this set."
3,Good for beginners,I found this book really helpful since I was learning Bioinformatics from zero. However-seems like a lot of stuff has changed so maybe one would want to get another book.
2,Poor quality control? No quality control?,"Gold Toe socks used to be quality, but that is not the case with these. There are loose threads and pulls in every single sock. I am giving them 2 stars instead of 1 because I did keep the socks and they are comfortable, but I don't expect them to last for years like the ones I am replacing. I've worn this brand for decades, but I think it's time to shop around for something else."
4,Muy buenos,"Buena calidad, buen elastico , llevo un año y la goma sigue bien, el problema es el color se destiñe muy pronto a pezar de lavarlas con agua fria"
5,Love these socks!,"I love these socks! I have tried many other brands, but have now only dedicated myself to Gold Toe. They are very comfortable, high quality, thick, smooth cotton. I couldn't ask for more from a pair of socks! Well worth the extra cost."
2,What happened 2 the BANGIN BEATS?,"I gave this Cd 2 stars, due 2 the fact that I am a fan of The Roots, but this project is WACK...the lyrics are TIGHT as usual, but the beats are LAME...I know, the prior reviews say else wise, but trust me, compared 2 their prior work, this is by far their WACKEST ALBUM...3 words (WICKETY, WICKETY, WACK) best describe this CD...major dissapointment...THUMBSDOWN...take my advice..."
3,These Roots Still Have Some Growing To Do,"The Roots are an interesting hip hop group in that they play their own instruments and are apparantly really good live, however, on this album, most of the songs are really repetetive and most of the rhymes and singing are kind of flat. Nelly Furtado and Jill Scott pop in for some vocals and really juice up the tracks that they appear on. The highlight for me (and the reason I bought the album) is ""The Seed"", with Cody ChesnuTT helping to cover his own song from his ""Headphone Masterpiece"" album.It has a lot more bounce and groove than Cody's original version and this kind of Rock n' Soul is something I would love to hear more of from The Roots. Some of these tracks seem to go on forevor and The Roots are definately not afraid to be pretentious or longwinded. They have talent and are on the right track but I don't feel that they have really found their groove yet."
4,Pretty darn good,"Phrenology was my introduction to the Roots, having heard them recommended, of all places, on All Things Considered.Bought the album, and thought it was brilliant."
3,Available else where,Not sure if it is the same exact item since there is no picture but it available at Toys R Us for $20!!!!! Save your money and buy their!
1,DeckA doesn't work after a few monthes,"I bought it, haven't used often. Yesterday, I found that the Deck ""A"" doesn't work, keep stopping. Now, it's over return period, don't want to spend shipping cost, just using the Deck ""B"" only. But, not sure when this deck is also going wrong. Very Bad player! don't buy.now, the deck ""B"" is not working....Don't buy..."
3,Disappointed,"The player is in bad need of an earphone jack for private listing which it does not have. Also it records on the right side only, the left side is just for playback and the dementions given on the add are totally wrong. No way is it as big as they say and 11 inches hi?? Ha ha ha , no way...Other than that, it does do a good job of recording.."
4,Onkyo cassette recorder player,I rec'd the recorder very promptly and it works well. I don't like the counter as it does not tell you the minutes of recording or playback it is something else that has no meaning .
4,"clean, feminine scent that feels good","Love this scent. Bought it at Disney two year ago. Bought the perfume and body creme. It lasted a long time. Loved the layering but it was too expensive to use it all the time. Tried to buy it several discount places, but the smell didn't seem right. Definitely order it or buy in person at Disney. Note: every time I wear it, men hug me and comment on how wonderful I smell!"
3,Nikon Battery,Nikon original battery is not any better than knock-offs.Knock-off batteries are 1/3 of the price. Knock-off batteries provided an equal amount of pictures per charge
2,Big shame,"I love love love love George Maharis...and this movie its fun, a typically 60s spy-/action-thriller.But I hate all those DVD-R releases by MGM and Warner Bros. Archive Collection: not restored, no chapters / menu, and the most big MINUS for hard / deaf hearing people - NO SUBTITLES.OK, it may be original Widescreen, but the picture quality is not perfect, color are also not perfect. Why this cheapy produced DVD but selling it expensive (the most) for $ 26.00 ???"
5,ONE MOVING THRILLER,"Before OUTBREAK there was THE SATAN BUG. With a top-notch cast and one of the best film directors in the business in control, this movie is a science-fiction winner."
2,"huge outside, small inside","I believe the title says it enough.. the backpack is huge outside and inside it lacks of space. Besides that, the zipper is awful, specially the one that opens only in the center to reach the camera.The material inside is not good also.. so I'm returning it and going to a local best-buy like store to find another one.I have also ordered the Lowepro SlingShot 100 All-Weather Digital Camera Backpack (Black) which is great (much better than the Kata one, in spite of being smaller).I do not recommend this one."
5,Very Comfortable,"Even with a 30d, 430ex, 70-200mm f/2.8L, kit lens, 15"" macbook pro, tripod, and all the little stuff this thing is still very comfortable. It will also be able to fit my future 24-70mm f/2.8L and probably one or two small primes. Great bag I highly recommend it at whatever price it might be selling at."
5,I won't leave home without this one !!!,"Very detailed, I found ""serious cycling"" easy and enjoyable to read. Ideal for the self - coached athlete, it helps personalize your cycling program depending on your present abilities. While reading you find that there is much more to training and becoming a better rider then you first thought, but it puts the ""why"" into training in addition to the ""how"" giving a better understanding and appreciation with what changes your body must undergo to be a better cyclist.Periodization, training modes, keeping diaries and more... The nutrition section I found to be a little ""old school"" but, nevertheless, interesting and backed by studies. This information is aimed at the ""serious cyclist"" and may be too much for someone not willing to put forth the 15+ hours a week."
1,wrong edition,"The Bicentennial edition has a copy right date of October 2012, per the Norton website. The one currently pictured has a copy right date of 2004. So this may not be the textbook required for a class."
4,"Past, Lives, Future, Lives, Revealed","Some case studies described in this boook contain many unexpected and quite strong and profound stories as well as powerful images for the reader, quite unexpected to say the least, much more depth and variety than I have read before.The Hypnosis exercises at the back of the book are very informative and useful in continuing the exploration of Past Lives, Future Lives & Beyond"
1,Help! Not Very Helpful!,"As a former teacher in the public and Christian schools, and as a former Sunday School teacher, I felt this book was outdated. Had I noticed that its copyright date was 1972, I would NEVER have ordered it. I'm glad it was cheap, but wish I'd saved the amount paid for book and postage to put on one I could read before buying."
5,Very Useful Book,"In _Designing Instruction for Technology-Enhanced Learning_, Patricia L. Rogers brings together thirteen articles on the use of technology to enhance learning. The articles are separated into five sections or topics: (1) an overview of instructional design, (2) foundations of instructional design, (3) designing for learners in primary and secondary education, (4) designing for learners in higher education, and (5) designing for learning environments. By covering each of these five topics, those interested in the integration of technology into learning or the classroom at any level will be served by this book.Any reader of this book will welcome the ideas and information about integrating currently held technological knowledge into their pre-existing classroom practices. The book helps the reader makes the connection between intended learning outcomes, teaching strategies and instructional media."
2,Warning - Doesn't attach to newer factory-installed roof racks!,"When we received this carrier, it stated on the box that it doesn't fit newer style roof racks that are either flush or molded. (However, there was nothing in the product description to indicate that!) We have a 2004 Chrysler Town & Country with the factory installed roof rack. The clips on the latch-down belts that you have to wrap around the rack do not fit between the bottom of the rack and the car! For that reason, we were unable to actually use the bag, but it did appear to be of decent quality. Make sure you have half an inch or more between your roof rack and the roof of the car before you get this one!"
4,what a room saver,"I really am happy with this product... I bought it for a trip my family was taking. It saved us a lot of room inside even with having a Jeep , with 4 peoples stuff we needed the extra cargo space."
3,A bit too snug for larger dogs,"This will comfortably store medium-sized breeds for long trips, but larger breeds might find this a bit cramped. Long road-trips will go a lot easier if you ask your vet to prescribe Valium ahead of time. And don't forget to poke a few air-holes ... this baby is waterproof!Cleanup will be a breeze if you invest in doggy diapers -- especially if your dog is not well trained.Wee-Wee Disposable Doggie Diapers, Large"
4,Great bag,My family and I have used this bag 3 times so far and it works great it's got about 3000 mi on it with no problems
1,worthless,Bag ripped up on first use only traveling 500 miles. The wind shred it like knives into butter. Don't waste your money!
4,Handy,this product came in handy for my college trip from georgia to michigan... wouldv'e have made it there without it!
4,Invicta Improving Quality,"This watch is big, i mean BIG. if you have a small wrist, you might want to consider something else. Invictas quality has dramtically improved over recent years. This watch is using a swiss quartz movement which is reliable and I have tested it jetskiing for its water resistance. Good watch, very fashionable and functional. This watch will attract eyes."
1,Busted within 90 days,"The tool is functional...when it is in one piece.Cons: cheap, does not last, the unit broke into two pieces after little usage.Other complaint: the screwdriver easily falls out of the unit.You get what you pay for!!!! Hindsight being 20/20, I wish I would have forked out a few more bones and purchased a more durable tool! Manufacturer's website provides little or no info on warranty service....time to pull out the JB Weld....***UPDATE*** I contacted Amazon today (4/23/12) regarding the above and they immediately provided me a full refund! I love amazon, make most my purchases on Amazon, they are truly customer oriented!"
3,Socket not deep enough,"The drive for the bolts connecting the trucks to the deck was not deep enough for my custom hardware. Works fine for a regular skateboard deck.In addition, the screwdriver that is stored in the handle does not stay in there, rather there is a whole that is too small to lock it in; the screwdriver constantly falls out. Annoying."
5,Great deal!,Needed this book for a course and it arrived on time and in excellent condition. Thanks!
3,Just ok,I have to say that im not a huge fan of Orange Goblin. I liked very much <<Time Travelling Blues>> and i liked their first one album. I find the 3rd album just ok as this one and i didnt like at all their previous album. In this album they continue to play stoner rock in the steps of Spiritual Beggars. Unfortunately they did not make it so well. There areno memorable moments and this is definitely not an amazing <<5 star album>> thet you will love and want to listen many times. Its simply just another rock album. Only for collectors. Only if you liked very very much their previous works then you will like this too.
4,"""La Finestra di Fronte"" Is a Genuine Pleasure to Watch","First, I must say that I found FACING WINDOWS (or ""La Finestra di fronte"") deeply affecting. It combines elements of history, suspense, romance, and sentimentality in a very polished and effective fashion. In fact, because of its sentimental heart, I would say that the film is quintessentially Italian, except the writer/director Ferzan Ozpetek is Turkish.I appreciated the layers of storyline that Ozpetek created, and the film has such a lush sheen, it makes lower-middle class Italian life look pretty good. In fact, I enjoyed this movie so much, here's how far I have to stoop to find something to criticize:Why do marketers insist on giving movies asinine taglines? In this film's case it is: ""Desire has no bounds."" This is so stupid, it would have put me off the movie had I been aware of it beforehand. (End of needless tirade.)SIDELIGHT: The actor who plays the WWII survivor, Massimo Girotti, passed away shortly after the film's completion."
1,Not a good item,The item was not new like it said in the ad. In addition it had hardly any life left and is already dead. It did not even last a month.
4,Thrilling,This book was very exciting and shows how two young lovers can triumph threw anything. This book is very inspirational and shows in detail the hardships the Jews had to indure during WWII.
4,A surprisingly good read,"I'd never heard of Joseph Glass. WhatEVER. I thought the synopsis sounded exciting and was willing to give it a go. Isn't it rich when you find an author you actually like, and a book you can VIBE on? I liked Eyes a whole heckuvalot. I especially appreciated the psychic element to the tale...this subject in general intrigues me, and when peppered into a fast paced tale it is really enhancing! I would get this book if you're a fevered devourer of murder mystery lore linked with psychic phenomena. It was fun. Yay to Eyes. K bye. Smooches!"
1,Another crump out of warranty,"I had the same experience as others here. The drive worked OK but died completely about 15 months out. La Cie claims it's more expensive to fix it than to replace it...so I will replace it, but not with one of theirs."
2,A twist of Marley,"The album, over all is nice. I don't particularly care for the way some of the beats were done (I'm a percussionist so I pay close attention to the drums). The musicianship was wonderful. They could have kept the vocalists also. I personally love to hear an artist make their instruments sing the vocals instead of a person singing."
2,A sophisticated piece of recompilation.,"First off, if you wonder in what language that song is sang that sounds like redemption song? Douala!!!! Yes that is the language and little by little and bit by bit and indeed little bit by little bit, this central african language from Cameroon, first appeared in Michael Jackson's Thriller in the 80's. It is elbowing its way thru the boulevards of modern jazz , with pioneers like Richard Bona, the African Bazz jazz erudite.Well, this album is well crafted , in every aspect.Yes true Bob purists mAy find that this album lacks that ginger taste from Kingston!! Well, I believe that the flavors had just been substituted with all kinds of other fLavors from around the world, making this twist even SPICIER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!M""BOLO!!!!!!!!!(BYE)"
3,Enjoyable,"This is a good listen to anyone who appreciates music. This album might be a tribute to Bob Marley but many would say it doesn't have the Marley spirit. I'd say it does, Marley's spirit was in the words, the feel of the lyrics, and this album does retain them. The music here is much better than many other failed remixes with hip-hop and jazz artists. It could have been better but I enjoyed it anyways."
1,"Found this ""jazz masterpiece"" in the dollar bin","Yes, they've ""twisted"" Marley alright: twisted his music into a synthesized, commercialized, and slickly produced mockery for the 35 and up 98.1 FM crowd. Does anybody see the irony in easy listening artists singing songs about struggle? The only thing these singers get up and stand up for is to hand parking valets the keys to their luxury cars. If this CD is such a ""masterpiece,"" then why did people continue to buy more elevator music from Kenny G? If you want the songs from the CD, just get Legend and listen to real Marley."
2,shopping at kmart,"...... is exactly whaty listening to this album is like. i don't know or care who the artists on this album are, but they're no marley. they don't even do him the least bit of justice with their slow, meandering, elevator music versions of some of his classics. don't waste your time or money on this album. it's just plain bad."
3,They changed the recipe,"I LOVED this soup when I first tried it years ago. I've been looking for it recently and found it here. I bought a few cans but was very disappointed to learn they changed the recipe. The flavor is still there (well, mostly) but the wonton fillings are no longer bulbous, filled sections, they are now paper-thin fillings(no exaggeration, it's just a thin line) - the wontons aren't round any more, they're flat! The wonton filling was the best (and main) part of the soup but it's practically gone now.I'm hoping they go back to their old recipe and not be so stingy on the filling. The wontons aren't abundant and they're tiny, so how much could it really cost to fill them and satisfy their customers?"
5,Great follow-up to Mark of the Assassin!!,"After reading the Mark of the Assassin I couldn't wait for his next book. The wait was truly worth it.However, we still don't know who the Director is. Maybe we'll get more clues in his next novel. Keep up the great work D.S."
4,Good read,"Thumbs up to the seller, thumbs down to Amazon. This is not a Gabriel Allon novel. I enjoyed the book."
4,Another very good effort from Silva,"Another page turner from Daniel Silva!!! Michael Osbourne, hero from The Mark of the Assassin, returns as the chief protagonist in the Marching Season. Against the backdrop of the long-standing conflict in Northern Ireland, the secret order called the Society is again attempting to create global unrest to further their own agendas. The Marching Season is a fast-paced, exciting read. Many of the characters from the Mark of the Assassin, both good and evil, are back, allowing for further character development for the readers who also read Silva's previous work. The story has action, excitement, intrigue, and frequent plot twists - leading up to an unexpected ending. This is another solid effort by Silva. You won't be disappointed if you give this a go."
2,m2m wet wet summer,"after the excellent m2m 1 / m2m 2 , m2m 3 if BORING.THE DIRECTOR/PRODUCER has lost his touch. only 30+ minutes long and only 1 of the 4 viganettes is worth the money."
3,Subject Matter Not So Exciting for an Actual Vanderbilt,"I am a great-grandson of William K Vanderbilt Jr. and I must say I don't find all of these books about my relatives particularly fascinating. It is interesting though that the fortune was largely gone within a century and that my more well-to-do relatives are such because of my other family side's prudent investing (my grandmother's family), rather than inheriting great Vanderbilt wealth, they inherited decent sums (certainly fortunes but nothing like the Vanderbilt ones) and have played wisely over the years, rather than spending their wealth like fiends."
2,Quality issues,"I got the rebranded Gateway version of this DVD+ recorder while it was on sale. I have a Panasonic DVD-R recorder which is much better: better picture quality, better reliability, and better user interface. Also, DVD ""minus"" discs are much more compatible with DVD players than DVD ""plus,"" although if you have a new player, it should have no trouble with either format.The real problem with the Lite-On/Gateway is build quality. The player feels cheap, and it does tend to get hot as some reviewers have pointed out, which is a problem for those of us wanting to keep it in an entertanment center. You literally need to put an AC next to it to cool it during long recordings. Also, my particular unit broke after a few months, so I don't have much confidence in this brand.You might be better served with a Panasonic or Toshiba, which will offer better quality and reliability (important for DVD recordings) at a reasonable price."
4,"Play the game, or read the book?!?","Halo: The Flood follows the actual X-Box game story and timeline wise but as a book does, fills in any gaps that may or may not have been missing from the game. An excellent read whether you have played the game or not."
1,Should have listened to previous reviews,"Guys this book is boring. Period. It is, in essence, a literal walk through of Halo CE. There is a minor amount of information to learn that halo fans would appreciate that it is simply not worth the price, even if you don't mind tedious reading. The book is currently 74% on my kindle and it will not go any higher. Its too bad that this book was a bridge between other halo books written by a more competitive author."
2,Don't waste your time,"This book pretty much follows the game to a tee. Just as one reviewer had put it so perfectly, ""Master Chief walks into t room and kills (put number here) aliens, walks into next room and kills..., walks around the corner and kills..., etc, etc, etc, (and it goes on forever)It is painfully long and boring and I couldn't' wait to be finished with it. I thought that if I read the entire thing I may gain some little tidbit I hadn't known before...WRONG. IMO, skip this and go right to ""First Strike"""
1,What a waste of paper,"I cannot believe this hack (Dietz) wrote a novel that precisely mirrors the game. I guess if M$ dangles enough money in front of a writer and says ""put this one dimentional story into a novel format"" any writer would do it. I was 60 pages into the book and hoping that Dietz would figure out a way to put in SOMEthing that would make this book interesting. But 60 pages of mind numbing was my ""puke point"" and I gave up. This book was so bad it was the first time I ever considered sending a book back to Amazon and demanding a refund. Unfortunately I spilled wine all over it.Add a 1/2 a star, I guess, if you never played the game.Skip this one and go straight to the Nylund book in the series. You won't miss anything important in this one."
3,To be or not to be..,Do you have to read this book or will you even want to?These questions can be answered with a resounding NO. It's nice to have tiny insight on different views from the aliens or flood but ultimately this is a book for those of you who have not played the original Halo and honestly it's worth saving the money up and purchasing the game for pc and playing it through rather then purchasing this book. The other books are much better. I thought perhaps this would be good to follow up The fall of Reach but honestly I'd rather just play Halo 100 times over than have to read this book ever again. If you are stubborn and don't play the games then read this.
1,A verbal account of the Halo 1 video game.,"This book seemed awkward to me as the author simply describes the actions a player would be going through as they played the game. Cut scene dialogue is verbatim, some scenarios are expanded for plot purposes, and some new characters are introduced to fill out the straight-from-the-screenplay storyline. Perhaps the only somewhat interesting part is that you get to know what other characters are doing on Halo while you are completing missions."
2,what were they thinking?,"I love FW,not in the least because their production values are so high. Which is why I don't understand this dvd's sound mix.All you hear is guitar,and the drums come through adequately too. But WHERE is the bass and the vocal? Buried in the mix unfortunately..... I haven't been able to watch this all the way through because the mix is so bad.What happened? How could Jim, Ray, and Bill Metoyer sit in the booth and say ""yeah, this is good""? It's not even ""ok"". As a professional musician, I just don't get it.This needs to be re-mixed badly. If you enjoy the clarity of Fates other products this will be a disappointment.To the band:sorry, I love the band ,but this mix is not up to snuff."
4,"Good concert and overall performance, half-assed product","This was a great concert to watch, full of great songs, surprises (Kevin Moore in Still Remains) and musicianship. The performance, the audience, the selection of the songs, all good. However the editing and camera work is just awful, as other reviewers have pointed out. Also, in this day and age of dolby 5.1 surround sound we get 2.0 stereo for such wonderful music? Big mistake. The menu looks like the ones those first generation DVDs of the late 90's had, nothing special. On the other hand the extras are great, but the ""Simple Human"" video is missing.I won't ever understand why Matheos and co. can't deliver a quality DVD (both ""The View From Here"" and ""Live At The Dynamo"" lacking in some areas) but I guess a half-assed product from these guys is better than no product at all."
2,Flimsy,"Ordering a new one because, like the other reviewer, my pot fell in the sink and the plastic lip shattered. Cheap in construction but not in price."
3,warm,"when the coffe maker was new,the ""thermal"" holder would keep cofee hot for 6 hours.when it no longer stayed hot more than a couple of hours-i ordered a replacement.But it is no better than the one i replaced.I suspect that these are ""second's""(did not pass inspection)I wish i had NOT purchased this"
2,Flimsy design Flawed and expensive to replace,"I do like this coffee maker but the caraffe broke falling into the sink. Now it's $50 for a replacement, a whole new maker is $89. Sad. The old design is much better, lasted many years."
3,T-shirt is very very large,"T-shirt is extremely large....more like an extra large. Very wrinkled, as this was a gift for my granddaughter-a horse enthusiast- I had to iron it before wrapping it. Appears to be used rather than new."
4,Interesting,"I would recommed any person, kid or adult to read the book The Son of the Mob by Gordan Korman. It is like a Romeo and Juliet type book. Classic teen love book. Teens can relate to parts of this book."
3,Not for younger readers! Great for High School-age,"My 12 year old daughter selected this from a summer reading list for her age group. She ended up telling me how uncomfortable it was to read about strip clubs and prostitutes being bought for friends. I just want parents to know it's not appropriate for 12 year old kids, before they have to explain things that shouldn't have to be explained to someone of this age.I'm sure it's far more appropriate for the 16 and up readers."
4,Humorous,"Gordon Korman knows how to weave an intricate and humorous story. Here we have ""black comedy"" (out of the frying pan and into the fire) situations, where a ""son of the mob"" high school student falls in love with the daughter of an FBI agent. The comparisons to Romeo and Juliet are obvious long before Korman mentions it in the story.This book had me laughing out loud many times.And while I found the book entertaining, some situations are almost ""adult"" (but never graphic) in subject matter, which is why I gave it 4 stars.The book has rapidly become dated with the mention of tapes and cell phones that don't use texting, but the situations are still realistic, and humorous, for many teens."
3,this book is....; well you decide,Son of the mob written by kordon gordon is a great story about a mobster's son that deals with life's little probelms. there are many off-wall situations that cause you to feel for the main character; vince luca and understand what he is going through
2,Don&#65533;t expect the Sopranos&#65533;.,"This book tells the story of Vince Luca, a pretty normal 17 year old, except for, oh yeah, he's family is in the mob. The story moves back and forth between Vince trying to figure out how much, if any, he wants to be involved in the ""family business"" and his budding love affair with Kendra. Oh, Kendra's dad just so HAPPENS to be an FBI agent, and the one that's investigating Vince's family. I saw most of the twists in the story coming from miles away, and it everything was a bit unbelievable. Plus, I felt like Vince never really got developed as a character."
5,son of the mob was a great book,"the son of the mod to me was a gripping thriller, about a young man named vince. he was in family that you could call anythnig but normal . they were the big mob family in new york city and vince was struggling to make a nmae for him self outside the family buiseness .he didnt want any part of the buiseness but how always found his way back into it over his head.In my opinion son of the mob was a great book. It was an easy read and was something that captured the amagination of young teen age men i think it just stood out cuz it wasnt a 200 year old boring noval it was a book that could let kids think outside the box and use their amagination"
2,If the world were only as perfect as Dr Negroponte dreams...,"Call me a Ludditte if you will, but Nergroponte writes pipe dreams with this book. And surprisingly the book is repetitive in its ideas. I much enjoyed Stoll's Silicon Snake Oil over this semi-sci-fi book."
4,Prophetic,"Prophetic. Although very ironic that the only way to read it is in atom form, instead of bit form. Negroponte, who wrote this in the 90s goes over in vivid detail the technology of our day, explaining the impact of what happens when things move from atom-form to bit-form."
4,Excellent Finish and Beginning,Loved it.Summed up the first six (seven) books of the series and set the next trilogy up nicely.>Do yourself a favor. Read the book.
1,Looked Good,The glasses were broken. I threw them away. I think they would have been nice though for the price.
3,I wanted to see the photos,I thought the content of the book was fine. But I really needed to see the photos to get a better idea of what the author was talking about. I am a visual I guess. They did not show up well on my kindle keyboard. It is probably better for me to have the print edition or perhaps they show up better on a kindle fire.
3,Good information,The Organized Student: Teaching Children the Skills for Success in School and BeyondI thought this book contained good information and was easy to understand and follow. It wasn't anything earthshakingly new. I feel I could get the same information from the internet and talking with my sons teachers. I do like referring to it for ideas when we need it. It provides pictures that were extremely helpful for my visual son.
2,Organize the organizer,"This book has some helpful hints for helping students to be better organized, but the book itself is poorly organized. It didn't need to be nearly so long. It seemed as if the author felt the need to justify writing the book by fluffing the first chapters with fillers. I was constantly thinking ""just get to the point already"". Also, some of the comments about going to your child's school to help clean out lockers is just not realistic. Likewise, the recommendations to wait until your child is ready to cooperate are not really helpful. As a teacher, the demands on students today to get organized and stay on track and up-do-date are overwhelming.Connecting with your child's teacher and forming a partnership is the best way to communicate to the student that we are all in this together, and there really are few alternatives to ""getting it together"". Patience and gentle but firm prodding are the order of the day most days."
5,"Not just poems from an animal rescuers soul, but for an animal rescuers soul...","Like Ed I was drawn to the Gulf Coast after Katrina had hit. I even had the pleasure of meeting him at an animal sanctuary in Tylertown, Mississippi in October. We once again crossed paths in New Orleans, where Ed showed me the finer points of cat trapping : )It is difficult to explain to anyone who has not been to the Gulf Coast just what it is like...Ed's poems tell the tail well.Anyone who has done animal rescue, especially in the aftermath of Katrina, knows how difficult it can be. They also know the joy that comes when small victories are made. It's those moments of victory that make it all worth it. Ed captures all of these feelings in his poems, any animal lover will truly relate!"
1,"Tragic, So Tragic","Robbie (fat boy) Williams should team up with Geri Halliwell, two former members of crappy pre-teen bands. This rubbish might sell in the UK but I'm happy to say so far as with Geri's release it has bombed Stateside...Sad, real sad..."
1,Robbie,This latest album from robbie williams like his other ones is very dull and boring it is only his giant ego and self faith which keep him afloat nobody else would have shown their faces in public after being in take that
4,Did I mention?,"That Robbie Williams is a TRUE ROCK STAR? He's ego personified, yet he can go in so many different directions. Now that's art. I think his next album ""Sing While your Winning"" is even better, but ""Ego"" is no slouch. ""Angels"" shows his sensitive side... ""Millenium"" is the jaded RW...but he still has enough humor left for a little tongue in cheek.""Regrets,"" ""Strong"" and ""Killing Me"" are all classics in my book. It just goes to show that a boy band CAN introduce the world to a pop genius. RW is not afraid to show how smart he is and I love that."
5,Unfairly overlooked,"Robbie Williams has for a long time been criminally overlooked in the United States, especially considering he wipes the other male pop singers away into the trash. He's big, brash, has songwriting and singing chops and this collection of songs from his first two UK albums really leaves all the best tidbits. Tailor-made for the US and they don't even bat the eye! What's wrong with that picture? Robbie deserves to be bigger than Justin Timberlake, he's that much better. Take That was better than NSYNC, and although Justin's debut was actually quite spectacular, this album is much better. ""Millennium"" especially is one of the greatest pop singles in recent history: that is the real way to sample classic songs! Do yourself a favor and buy this album. TODAY! RIGHT NOW!"
5,Awesome blossom!,"Why aren't people attacking CD shelves and breaking doors on their way to grab this CD? I expect no less from the masses. Backstreet Boys? Ricky Martin? ARE ALL OF YOU CRAZY? This man's the real deal. His respectable, yet not too hefty, sales records proves, once again, that Americans have no taste. Shame on us! Robbie Williams is truly amazing. His sound has depth and a texture that embodies a real character--he really comes through his music. I was knocked-off my socks listening to this CD. I guarantee you will enjoy listening to Mr. Williams."
5,Great CD!,"When i first heard the song Millenium, i wasn't to sure of how well i liked it, but, after a while, it grew on me. I also liked Robbie's sort of cocky attitude, and his James Bond like image he portrays on TV. I decided to buy the CD, and i love every song on the CD. I would recomend this CD to anyone."
4,Dark story,"This story is very dark, but also contains a lot of insight into the prison system, reform schools and the individuals that are incarcerated. Would recommend for anyone with an interest in psychology or criminal justice."
4,I Like It,"I purchased 3 photo albums for my son and this one came in 2nd place. Here are some thoughts of mine:Positive Comments:-The colors are great, very bright-The album holds 12 photos total, 11 inside and 1 on the cover-It seems sturdy-The pages are easy to turnNegative Comments:-The photo slides in and you can only see part of the picture through the clear opening. It can be difficult to find a photo that is a good match to the opening, otherwise you might not see the people that are in the photo.-The space for the picture to slide in is much bigger than 4"" wide so the picture slides around in the spot.-The space for the picture to slide in is loose, the picture can easily come out or be taken out by little hands.Misc Comments:-This album is best for vertical pictures."
2,Useless if you're not Canadian!,This book discusses ways for a Canadian taxpayer to retire and avoid Canadian taxes. It's of little technical value to citizens of the United States!
4,Great Scott,"Scott of the Antarctic is a motion picture full of the trials and tribulations of adventure; it exemplifies the human condition and our attempts at conquest. The acting is in the standard British ""stiff upper lip"" model but none the less superb, as is to be expected from John Mills. Also, this copy, provides an adequate soundtrack, unlike the other DVD production copy, also available from Amazon, which presents an extremely noisey sountrack on our DVD system. All in all I am extremely satisfied with the content and production of this dramatic work of art."
1,What a Bust,"I have ordered this product twice. The product tastes fine. The problem is with breakage.The first time I ordered this product from Amazon more than 1/2 of the Bagel Snacks in all the boxes where broken into various size pieces. Since I had bought this product at the store before buying it a Amazon, and never had the contents broken into pieces like what I got from Amazon, I thought I would try to order it from Amazon again. Same result. At least half of the Bagel Snacks in all the boxes were broken into various size pieces from from dust size to larger pieces.Back to the store for more."
1,Disappointing,This was a disappointing purchase. It just seems like I overpaid for a cheap piece of felt and a couple straps.
1,All time classic album ruined,"DO NOT BY THIS! My disappointment with this cd package is profound. I previously owned a single CD copy of ""5000 spirits"", which I unfortunately left on a train, so here was trying to replace it and pick up an extra disc (the self-titled ""incredible string band"") as a bonus. Unfortunately, although ""5000 spirits"" is a fantastic album, something has gone terribly wrong with the remastering (re-wrangling?) here. The tracks are smothered in this horrible, unrelenting delay effect, which was not on my previous, unremasterd, copy - if it is intentional then those responsible have no taste, if unintentional then the channels have been sloppily mixed. All copies of this should be withdrawn from sale. Buy ""5000 spirits"", it is the Incredible String Band's most whimsical, most inventive. But AVOID this so-called remastered version."
2,Poorly designed layout .,"It seemed like they published this book on the cheap! Most of the pictures were hand shetches, and it took forever for the author to make a simple point. I think he just wanted to fill up some additional pages."
2,good info buried in blah blah blah,The author likes to tell stories and reminisce. There is good and helpful information in this book. But I was often frustrated while trying to find it.If this book was half of it's length (cutting out all of the non- technical info)I would find it twice as effective.
5,Four Season Harvest,"This book has been a help, we are new to the garden scene and this is easy to understand and also has illistrations to actually see what to do."
3,Must tighten a lot to keep speakers in place!,"Speaker mounts were delivered in a timely manner and were easy to install. I did notice however that once the speaker was mounted, the bolt used to hold the mounting angle had to be VERY tight. Otherwise the weight of the speaker would cause the angle of the speaker to change. Once tightened sufficiently the system worked well.Just be sure to tighten well when installing the first time and you'll save yourself a little time and aggravation!"
4,Ok for light speakers,"These are ok for light,(up to 8 pound) speakers. The mounting for key hole slots is a little funky. However, they do the job."
3,Noel Coward as a Detective?,"I am still a fan of Baxt's celebrity mysteries, but the last two have been less than exciting. In this one it's apparent who the murderer is right away. We even know the extent of the murderer's crimes so it's not a big surprise when we find out that there are numerous victims on the list. Also, Coward in this book doesn't seem real. He's more a plastic person that what he really was. But there are some exciting places in the book, and I will continue to read the series."
1,pssst!,Don't waste your money don't buy it new or used most definatly if its availible on amazon its because its the one I sent back this tv has screen issues if your looking for a crt tv keep looking.
2,I prefer the other books on the subject,This book contains a lot of helpful information for potential residents. The author is a good writer. Nevertheless I found Choose Costa Rica by John Howells and The New Golden Door to Retirement and Living in Costa Rica by Howard Christopher to be much better. Both of these guides seem to reflect the point of view of mature authors who have resideded in Costa Rica for much more time than the author of Living Abroad in Costa Rica. They offer much more insight and depth into the subject.
5,Great pump,"Great pump, also came with all new fittings and mount. Made in the USA. Great customer service as well. It was nice to be able to call and talk to a person here in the states."
2,Doesn't live up to its reputation,"I read this epic in English my freshman year of high school. I had heard many great things about this classic, but was sorely disappointed. It is repetitive, there is little to no character development, and each book (kind of like a chapter) is practically the same story line. Perhaps this edition is a bad translation. I might try the Fitzgerald one.A note: I think it's time we get some modern books into school curriculum. Just because they are considered classics doesn't mean they are any good by today's standards."
4,Good review of HVAC Principles for the Practicing Engineer,"I used this book in a course on HVAC design with an emphasis on built environments and building environmental controls. The book provides a good overview and useful examples in the areas of comfort design, contaminant controls and HVAC systems. The only real weakness I identified is that there are occasional errors in the text regarding the equations provided. The publisher should issue an addenda with this information so the student or practicing engineer doesn't find out too late that their calculation is incorrect. Careful checking will catch these (especially by verifying the units as you progress through the calculations), but this should have been caught during the publishers review of the text."
5,Awesome,I had to read the book for a Acts of the Apostles class that I am taking at Cincinnati Bible College. It really opened my eyes to what really went on in the life of Paul. It was very easy to read. Over all it was just an awesome book.
1,Disappointing!,"Having just finished the book, I was very disappointed in the novel. I was expecting much more. Mr. Wangerin portrays Paul/Saul of Tarsus as a tiny little man, with bandy legs and a head too large for his body, who ran about like a mad mad. this completely ruined the story for me. I realize it was fictional, but at the same time, I can't imagine the man, the roman, the Jew, the Pharisee, the one man who exerted such a wide influence on the worlds affairs, and Christian affairs, to be as he is described here in this horrid tale. Chritianity needed such a man as Saul, and the world needed such a mind. I do believe that he preached Christ crucified with a passion, and he did stir up the people. But not as the character described in this book.If you have held the Apostle Paul, in your heart, as the great preacher of the Gospel that he was. Don't waste your time on this work."
4,Ushouldownofcourseyoudo,"This brings a big smile when I hear this. Fun and interesting. It's no wonder Proscriptor and Andy LaRoque click. Melechesh own. Nile comparisons must not be heeded. Melechesh are not that similar. I think Sphinx better still, but this is new in my rotation. Anyway, the music is again an amalgam of Black Metal,Death Metal, & Thrash metal, bound together seamlessly with their Near East influences. Hightly recommended for the EXTREME metal head."
5,"The Calculus Gallery, an amazing history of calculus great achievements",If you love Calculus this is a book for you. I own another Dunham's books: Journey through Genius. Both books are gems. The author is crystal clear giving all the details. His style is cool and his choice of the subjects he treats is in accordance with the titles of his books. If you buy this book I recommend you also buy Journey through genius.
2,Wheels constantly fall apart,"We adore the large Automoblox, but hate to spend so much, so the minis seemed like a perfect compromise. However, the wheels just simply aren't as durable as the large cars. I think we have 1 wheel out of the 7 mini cars we have that still has its original tire covering. Disappointing. =( However, my daughter loves to put the tires together to make limos. =)"
5,not so much a review as a clarification,"the first track on the CD is actually data -- an enhanced section that can be viewed in your computer. there are 10 tracks total. the first song is by moodswings with chrissie hynde (lead singer of the pretenders) on lead vocals. every artist listed should be shifted down one, e.g. the deseo reconstruction is by future sound of london.. tracery is by nusrat fateh ali khan, etc.in my opinion, most of these tracks are among the best the artists have to offer, and many of the artists here are exceptionally good. much of it is laid back.. not sure i'd consider it running music."
4,Great CD!,This CD was great. My husband and I love the Snoopy and the Red Baron song and were thrilled that all of the Snoopy vs. the Red Baron songs we were looking for were on the CD. If you are looking for nostalgia this is the CD for you!
3,"Not ""Like New""","This book said like new condition which is what I was expecting. What I got was a book thats cover is bent and torn along the edges, the pages are discolored and have water damage and one page has a corner cut off. I am keeping the book because I quite like it but I am annoyed that I got a poor quality book when I thought I was getting one that was ""like new""."
2,Not very sturdy,Did not seem to support a 15 inch laptop very well. The plastic that it is made out of seemed to flex too much while in use.
1,Cheap piece of junk,"I bought this stand hoping for a simple, inexpensive means of using my laptop with better ergonomics and airflow around my Dell. After 2 weeks one hinge broke from simply assembling. Amazon quickly replaced.Second one broke after about 4 months. Again the hinges with minimal use.This is not even worth $20."
2,The blister wrap is brutal,"This is a good product, but getting it out of the thick blister wrap is a major hassle!!"
2,mediocre,"I did receive the product in time, which is great. But when I received the product, it was not what I was expecting. It's smaller and looks a bit cheaper than in the picture. But it is functional."
2,Getting out of packaging not worth it!,"The plastic packaging Kensington uses is not worth the trouble to me. I have never cursed so much in my life trying to get the stand out. Not only is the packaging kid proof, it is also adult proof. I was ready to send it back before I could get the stand out to even try it. Kensington probably pays more for the packaging then they do to make the stand."
1,Not good for much,"It is probably best for a 10"" Notebook but not anything else. It is too light to handle any computer over 10."
2,Poor quality but functional,"The moment I opened the stand, the plastic hinge at the back broke off. This is made poorly and is very flimsy. However, it is light weight, portable, and functional. For the price, it wasn't worth the hastle of returning it. I am using it broken and it still functions."
2,cheaply made,"I didn't research enough before making this purchase, it is very cheaply made and doesn't do the job I bought it for. My laptop keeps slipping on it.But returning it, I don't know if it is worth the postage to send it back."
5,Who Moved My Pulpit?,Book was in excellent condition. I was very pleased with Amazon's process and efficiency.
5,thanks!,Thank you so much for the book. I am reading it now to the class and they love it! The book came in great condition.
4,Fine for light weight speakers,"I used these brackest for a pair of Polk TL150 speakers which weigh about 2 lbs each. The brackets work fine but I think they would struggle with the rated 10 lbs. Plenty of screws and attachment options were provided but the screw for the thread-mount option was too short and only the key-hole mount worked. Although the angle bracket is meant to be mounted vertically, with light weight speakers, horizontal mounting seemed fine, which means I can easily change the angle of the rear speakers to get the best surround sound."
4,Great brackets for a great price,These things work great. The only problem I have found is you can easily over tighten them and crush the side walls. If you have some wooden dowel pins cut them to size and insert them after tightening them to the speaker mount. Then when you clamp them to the wall mount the dowel will help reinforce the wall.
2,A typical textbook,This is your typical textbook. It is boring and will put you to sleep. Why do all college textbooks have to be so darn boring. I guess it may be the subjects?
1,seeing pattern,"you need to set up the ""ISBN"" boxs so the customer can input the isbn # so they won't mistaken with other similar books.."
4,very nice,"this is a great bag, I bought it for my boyfriend, it is very nice looking, the pictures don't do it justice. The material looks just like leather and it is very soft. The zipper is well made and opens up the entire top so you can really rummage around in there.My only problem with it is that it doesn't have little compartments inside to hold things separate from each other."
2,Very limited.,"Teaching babies the numbers 1-5 is great and all, but I am beyond perplexed why in the world Baby Einstein stopped at the number 5. Do they really think that babies can't learn more than that? Good grief! They are just getting started there! This DVD is very entertaining. Indeed,it is mostly entertainment as the numbers one through five will be mastered in very short order there by making it pure entertainment. Save your money and buy Richard Scary's Best Counting Video Ever. It is just as entertaining (if not more so) and goes to number 20, with lots of cute dialogue that babies love. Similarly, check out Leap Frog Letter Factory (for letters) and Trebellina (for music). You won't be disappointed."
2,not their best effort,"This video does not hold my 15 month old daughter's interest. The package says from age 1, but I think that may be too young."
3,"Okay, but others are better!","This DVD is educational, but not as captivating as Baby Beethoven, at least for my young toddler. Baby Beethoven provides more music and action. This one is okay, but probably best for toddlers who are at least 18 months old. It is fairly slow paced but it does do a good job teaching numbers and counting. I enjoy watching Baby Beethoven more, too! It's good if you can enjoy (or at least tolerate) the videos you buy for your kids, because you'll be watching and listening to them over and over. This one doesn't have as much parent-appeal, altho it does provide more opportunity for interaction."
2,Not very tough,"This item is not very tough. I have an English bulldog, and she pull three ropes out in about 10 minutes of chewing. I think the ends are only glued in instead of somehow knotted together inside the ball. It is still mostly in a ball, but I was disappointed that it was torn apart so quickly"
3,About as expected,"Yup, it gets a bit chewed up in short order, my black lab puppy is a voracious chewer. About as expected though, and she really likes the feel of it. I guess that would be my high point, is that she found this to be a really satisfying chew toy for her teething puppy mouth. Note though that I found this product for a little over half the Amazon price at a local retailer. Unusual, but it happens."
3,fairly good,"its ok but my dog loves it so much, we just took it out an hour ago, and shes already ripped it up quite a bit"
3,Weak,"When I first took this out of the package, I was super excited and it was the perfect size for my large black lab. But after a while of playing with it, she tore the rope apart. It should not be to the point where she chews on it and the rope break within 10 minutes. I thought this was great, but she can only have it at some points and we will take it away from her after a few minutes."
4,good product,Good product for a good price. Our dog is an avid chewer and this holds up for a few weeks.
2,Pain in the backside!!,Unfortunately this is awful! I had high hopes for this toy but my 45lb black lab started shredding it within 2 days. The toy is still around but she SHREDS it every time she sees it. I don't have the heart to take it away because she really likes it but man is it a pain in my backside having to go behind her and pick up clumps of yarn. I wouldn't recommend this toy and I plan on buying all new ones so I can secretly throw this away.
1,Cookbook lacking big time!,"I had waited eagerly for the release of this book for months. I had eaten at the restaurant many times and was really looking forward to learn some secrets. Unfornuately, Mr. Uglesich has omitted the remoulade sauce for his fried green tomatoes (A signature dish) served at his restaurant. You would think he would have included this. When I inquired about why this was done, I was told that they would either bottle and sell the stuff or it would be in his next book! Don't waste your money."
3,"Leonard Maltin, we should not have known thee","A very good and interesting mix of Disney's WW2 vinettes undelibley marred by the corny introductions of film critic Leonard Maltin.Commentaries are as common on DVDs as raisnettes in movie theaters, but wisely, they are usually an option to turn on or off at the viewer's pleasure. Not so here. Maltin's bit is part of each chapter. Yes, you can FF over it, but why should I need to?"
3,Choking hazard,"I really like Haba toys. Haba is a great company and they make quality products. Unfortunately, Luxi has a little mirror on it that is glued on. Ours came unglued and we found it in our daughter's mouth."
2,Judith Krantz Box Set,"I have read these books years ago and have seen the movies on T.V. The Box I recieved was very poorly re-mastered to DVD, very poor quality other than that the movies are still excellent but the quality of sound and picture is poor. I have a new Sony DVD player and several others in my home so it is the quality of the re-mastering from T.V. or VHS to DVDSincerely Diana Gallant"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,What a piece of crap! Will not stay together after being assembled CORRECTLY! My twin daughters have probably only played with this 2 or 3 times because the pieces start coming apart anytime they are touched. I certainly hope the company that made this toy sees some of these reviews and makes improvements.
3,Fun but Frustrating!,"My 3 year old daughter had been asking for the My Little Pony Castle for Christmas, but after reading poor reviews, my mother decided to try the Amusement Park instead. My daughter loves to play with this toy but gets quite frustrated with it coming apart all the time. There are 3 main pieces to the roller coaster and they don't snap together very well. I'm constantly putting them back together for her. It's kind of hard (especially for a toddler) to put the ponies on the ferris wheel. The ""wings"" also fall off the wheel a lot. I think this toy is great if you want something to look cute in your daughter's playroom, but beware if she actually uses it, and don't even try to move it all in one piece. My daughter is having fun with it for now, especially getting the ticket and seeing the picture taken, but I definitely see it going in the garage sale next year."
2,So cute to look at but DON'T TOUCH!!!!!,"This toy is very flimsy. My daughter just turned six and got it for her birthday, she really wants to play with it but I am continuously putting it back together. The rollercoaster comes apart, the ferris wheel leans forward if you actually put ponies on it and eventually comes apart...over and over and over. We love the my little pony play sets and up until now have never found one that was so C-H-E-A-P but that is what this one is. If you buy it be prepared to repair again and again."
5,its great...snooze you lose! i got my copy haha!,"clapton,beck,and page are all here. it only makes you want more footage as you can tell its been edited from lengthier performances. good narration and insights from various band members.well made. boy i sure enjoy my copy! are you envious or what! HEEHEE"
1,Very disappointing,"Having enjoyed the VeggieTale videos for years, I had expected that a video game licensed by the same company would be of similar quality. Sadly, that is not the case. I gave this game today to my seven year old son and he quickly became frustrated with the dodgy controls, time limit, and overall poor game play. Perhaps ten years age this would have been seen as a cutting edge game. However, this game has the appearance of a project thrown together over a weekend by a group of not overly skilled junior programmers. P.S. Dear Big Idea, in order to get people to learn from your game as they play, you need to make a game that people will, in fact, want to play."
3,"good, in its way, but...","why the ridiculous and uneven epithets (""shootafar"" [!], instead of, ""he who shoots from afar"" [i mean, really!], or, ""far shooting""; ""phoibos"", instead of, ""shining"")!? confusing and, frankly, silly enough to ruin the reading."
5,Kitchen Cosmetics by Jeanne Rose,"This is a great book, very beautiful and easy to follow. My mother and I have been able to make the best home-made skin care products. The herbs are limited to 25 simple ones that I have been able to find and use. Some of them we grow. Great formulas, clean and easy. We love this book and are going to buy more of Jeanne Rose books."
5,LOOKING FOR LAUGHS LOOK NO FURTHER,A fantastic program which introduces you to the real world of the office setting way before THE OFFICE came into view. The first season shows Drew's competency with incompetency all around. A great supporting cast. Sighhh...just wish we could see the rest of the seasons released..then we would have nirvana.
4,Fan,"Was a gift, person I bought it for is a long time fan and was excited when he received it. Hoping for more seasons to be released."
1,Way too expensive!,"I love the TV itself, it is excellent in all aspects. As other reviewers have stated though, the bulb has only lasted up to one year and they are expensive. The first one was almost $400 installed. There will not be a second one which is available for $250. The TV is just under 2 yrs old. We thought this TV would be a less expensive second unit when we bought it at the same time as our LCD flat screen. This Toshiba has now cost a lot more."
2,GET AN EXTENDED WARRANTY or pay the price.,"I wish I knew before I bought this TV for my dad. I think I paid $799 for it just 15 months ago and the lamp has to be replaced. Until this point I was happy with Toshiba products(I have a 42"" LCD and two HD-DVD players) but now...How can you justify a TV that costs $1000 retail having to have a $200 part every year? Of course the warranty expired 3 months ago. An extended warranty may have covered the new bulb but you have to make sure, for $50 bucks or so the 2 year warranty would cover 2 bulbs at this rate and save about $400."
5,I'll Take Manhatten,"I just adore movies like this! Mini series are so much fun to watch when they are made well, and this one is. Maxi {Valerie Bertinelli} gives you a charactor you'd just love to be. From the spoiled brat, to the resposible woman who comes out a winner all the way around. I first saw this on t.v. Never dreamed they'd make it into a dvd. I am so glad they did! It's a long movie but when I started to watch it...everything else went by the way side. I couldn't NOT watch it. Back then, you couldn't fast forward through all the commercials. Now I can pause it and get a pop or whatever and come back to my beloved movie. By all means buy this. That is if you love, love, intrigue,betrayal,happy endings, smart and dumb choices, and yet it all comes out GREAT!!! You couldn't ask for better."
3,Tears in the rain,"I think that it is one of the best movies I have seen in years. I am trying to buy the VHS, but the price ...is just too much. I also would like to find the music, it stayed with me for days. I think the bonbing scene very realistic, went through them in Coventry."
3,"Over all a good book, but way to high priced.",I found the info on Anakin before he became Vadervery interesting but for what you pay it isn't worth it.
2,Dissatisfied,"I ordered 4 pair of these socks for treadmill running. I have large feet (size 15-16). I ordered the largest size and they are still too small, but usable. The quality of these socks is not as good as I expected. After only 2 weeks they are starting to pill up and look like they are 10 years old. The fabric has a two tone type appearance. They have an opaque yellow color right out of the bag. This is purely cosmetic, but adds to the disappointment of the product overall. On the treadmill, they are just average feeling. Not worth a premium over any other sock."
3,The Art of Shen Ku,"Interesting book, has some good useful material and some fluffy and useless overly complicated material. His original track was to make something universal and simple, he started to get complicated with some of his information and missed simple truths of some of the information listed. Author could have spent more time the use of herbs for healing, he was on the right track but went short on the information.Overall something to read for entertainment."
4,great dvd duo,"I really like these two dvd's. Ron Kauk, DanO and the rest of the climbers in here are truly fun to watch."
1,Total waste of money!,"This is a cheaply constructed pamphlet - it is NOT a paperback. I paid $4.95 for this, instead I should have written some common phrases and questions on an index card. I intend to return this to Amazon, even paying postage, to make this point."
2,Didn't really seem worth the price,"I ordered this for my nephew's Christmas present. When it arrived, I was underwhelmed. Just one railroad car and a few track segments. It did look nicely made and attractively packaged; but I expected a little more for [...]. I suppose the expectation is that you'll buy multiple Thomas sets, I just don't have lots of money for that. I ended up returning this and buying a different toy for my nephew."
4,"Great Game, to short for me.","A love this game, the end was great, I usually don't wait to see the credits but I didn't except the game to continue after them. The soundtrack amazing. I give it a 4 starts overall because is to short it lets you wanting for more."
2,Disappointing,"I got this video for my folks, since it sounded like something they'd like. I was disappointed to learn that they hadn't liked it at all; my mother was going to donate it to the hospital thrift shop for resale!Oh well..."
4,Nuncrackers,"bought this as xmas gift so don't know how the receipent likes it yet, but she's a big fan of Rue's so I'm sure she'll love it."
5,"Excellent tea with different, full flavor","The six pack is a good value, really no more than I'd pay for tea in the grocery store. I LOVE this tea, it is much stronger and full bodied than ""normal tea"" and mixing the Earl Grey with lavender gives it a great taste. Most people would probably want to add sugar but as I have stopped drinking coffee, this is the right amount of slightly bitterness that works for me. Much better than regular Earl Grey tea. Have not tried the other flavors as I don't like fruity teas. This stuff is great."
2,Not the best,"Yeah...this book basically seems to follow Dan Browne's to the letter. I had to laugh at another review of it, especially this line: ""This is the only [commentary on The Da Vinci Code] written from a balanced, secular point of view.""As if a secular point of view is any less biased regarding God/religion than a religious one is. Hilarious.If you want to know more, go for the Tony Robinson series on the Real Da Vinci Code, especially when he wants to excavate under the church. Brilliant stuff."
1,Two Thumbs Way Down!,"For an alleged expert on the Davidic bloodline, Lunn's 'revelations' couldn't be more collegiate and trite. He trots out all of the usual 80s 'Holy Blood' retreads and expects us to be impressed. Big deal. As well, I purchased all of the Disinfo series on the media ($200+) and was sorely disappointed. There was only one decent article in the set from Russ Kick on 9-11. Other than that, nadda. And there is likewise absolutely nothing new to be gleaned from Lunn's stenography here.For the keen student of the occult, I would be much more inclined to recommend Fritz Springmeier's awesome magnum opus 'Blood Lines of the Illuminati.' His book is the real deal."
1,Not quite what I expected,"I find this shoes a little bit too complicated to put on, it actually took me 30 minutes to figure out which strap goes to the other. Not so pleased with it."
5,Woody can do no wrong,"This is a fabulous documentary. Fun all the way, good music, good charm and witt. A new slant on his lovely wife plus his parents are too funny. Loved it."
1,do not buy,It won't play in our part of the world. It is made to play in Europe and I did not understand that when I ordered it.
3,"Good, but gets boring...","Title says it all. At 1st its fun, but after a while you'll get bored quick."
2,Good Parts Don't Quite Gell,"Some interesting possibilities (gay, bipolar, tough guy, criminal- detective as lead, Brixton-centered plot, oddball crime boss) don't really gel into anything that interesting. The con is asked to find a white girl in Brixton, which sounds simple, but causes all kinds of complications. The whole bipolar thing wears thin quickly, and the style isn't quite on."
5,Do not confuse with standard Death Rain - OUCH,I'm still giving this 5 stars because it is an excellent product if you are going for heat over taste. If you want less heat and fantastic flavor go for the standard Death Rain Seasoning. I give the standard 6 stars out of 5 - wish I'd just purchased a case of that. I think it will take me many years to go through the case of Nitro I mistakenly bought. :)
5,A fantastic book!,"I have to say, I am very surprised at the one star reviews this book/cd has received! Our family originally got this from the library, and my kids (age 4 and 6) loved it so much that I decided to buy it. The songs are fun, simple, and sing-able! We love that they are sung by Julia Donaldson herself, as it gives us more connection to her as the author. We also like the challenge of singing along to the instrumental versions, so it's nice that this cd has both. We have lots of sing-a-long books, but this is one of the best. Five stars all the way!!"
2,Very poor DVD transfer,"The movie's cinematic qualities withstanding, this is a very bad DVD. Video quality is terrible -- very grainy. Sound is mediocre. Rent (DVD or VHS) and watch again to make sure you REALLY like this movie before you buy it on DVD. I did the same and decided I could wait for a better version to be released."
3,A rare Criterion misfire,"I must add my voice to those who are disappointed in the video and audio quality of this Blu-Ray release. When my fiancee and I sat down to watch this movie, she remarked, ""Wow, this is beautiful photography. I bet it will look even better when we get it on Blu-Ray"" . . . to which I had to reply sheepishly that this *is* the Blu-Ray.I should have read the customer reviews here before purchasing this disc. Instead, I relied on the usual superior standards of Criterion releases to guide my purchase decision. Now that I learn that this release omits a lengthier cut of the film that's been included in previous versions as well . . . I'm just mystified that Criterion put their stamp on this disappointingly murky print of an otherwise beautiful and haunting work of cinema. I'll be checking the reviews for all further Criterion purchases now."
2,Defective Criterion Blu-Ray Soundtrack,"Sadly, Criterion's Blu-Ray edition of THE LAST EMPEROR has a quality control problem severe enough to note here. The DTS surround track has been incorrectly mastered in monaural for the first couple of hours into the picture. Hopefully Criterion will correct the problem on subsequent prints, otherwise their standard dvd version is the one to own for now."
5,"Wow, awesome movie","Great acting, wonderful story and scenery. This isn't the type of movie I usually watch (I'm a male in my mid 20's...typically prefer comedy and action), but I enjoyed every minute of this! Recommending to all my friends."
2,The best reason to keep my LaserDisk Player,"This is my least favorite DVD transfer. Perhaps this is amplified because it is one of my 5 favorite films of all time. The DVD compared to the film and even the Laserdisk, the whites bloom, it is soft, and the colors are not as accurate or consistent. This is a shabby way to treat a great film. With so much interest in the restoration of classics, it is appalling a contemporary film is treated with such disrespect. The additional footage is welcome, but unnecessary to plot development. The promise of DVD to allow different edits is not realised here. We should have the option of the original AND the Directors cut."
5,Dazzling,"I'm Chinese and this is one of the most accurate and wonderful depiction of the Chinese life I have ever seen from a foreign director. His superior understanding of the culture and customs of Chinese civilians are unbelievable. This is the story of the last supreme ruler of China, Yu Pi. He is confined within the walls of the Forbidden City of Peking for most of his childhood. Then he is overthrown by the armies of Chang kai sek and is forced to seek refuge in Japanese control. His attempt to reclaim power is in vain. He was considered a war criminal and forced to serve 10 years in prison with his brother.Amazing in detail and broad in scope, this film well-earned its 9 Academy Awards. This unforgettable film never fails to deliever a blow to the hearts of the viewers. Buy the final director's cut, it's longer and well worth it..."
3,Good for the price,"Item was discounted quite a bit, but, the package was smashed up a bit. DVD were in good shape and worked well. Overall a good seller."
3,Exoticism not a substitute for style,"Bernardo Bertolucci (another 7-syllable name like Federico Fellini, Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio de Sica - only this time without the magic) is all into the trappings of people's lives, so he was perfect for this subject. Alas, he can't begin to illuminate what's beaneath the trappings. He added almost an hour to this ""director's cut,"" and the extra footage doesn't add a tincture of information about poor Pu Yi, China's Last Emperor (always excepting 'Chairman' Mao), that might have made this tedious film worth enduring. And the politics of this movie, set in the midst of some of the most politically charged moments of the last century, are particularly ridiculous. This is Vittorio Storaro's film, really, who gives us an insider's tour of the magnificent Forbidden City - a marvel of Chinese culture which casts a gigantic shadow across the whole Communist era."
2,Good movie.... Awful DVD,Enough comments have been made on the movie so I'll just tell you my opinion on the DVD edition. It is one of the worst DVD transcription I have ever saw. I really had the impression to watch a DivX. Do I need to tell more about the resolution? Only the english soundtrack is available (I wish the movie had been shooted in Chinese or Mandarin but that's not the point) and no subtitles. The DVD presents the director's cut which makes the movie 3 and a half hour instead of 2 and a half. The theatrical version is not available on the DVD... Otherwise there is no additionnal material.
2,I'm watching as I write this. Poor DVD quality,"What a shame that a gorgeous movie like this is given poor treatment. I'm quite shocked by the video quality of this disk. It isn't as bad as the absolutly horrendous transfer of Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" being perpetrated on innocent customers by Madacy Entertainment, but for a contemporary film, it's pretty poor."
5,Beautiful Blu Ray transfer,"Criterion Collection does an incredible job of transfering movies to Blu Ray. The images are so clear, colorful, and look as good as they do in the theater. I would recommend this movie for the look alone."
1,LOUSY DVD,"This is a WONDERFUL movie. One of my favorites. But this is a TERRIBLE DVD.There are no special features, although there is a text box on the back of the box supposedly enumerating the ""Special Features"" (including the ""4:3 Widescreen"" format).The ""widescreen"" format is simply a scam! The original (2.35?) aspect ratio of the film has been reduced to 4:3 pan and scan, then ""enlarged"" for 16:9 by cutting off the top and bottom! The resolution is AWFUL. Worse than over-the-air analog broadcasts.I was so horrified at the quality of the picture I can't speak to the value of the additional footage, or even to the sound quality. I was simply unable to watch such awful treatment of a great cinematographer's work."
4,Oops,"No problems with the order and shippment. Arrived quick and intact.Although the box is 14x14, the cover for the box that I received fit on the box in only ONE direction. I installed and wired this box, then found out that I would have preferred to have the printing on the cover in a different direction.The cover has an embossed ""Leviton"" that ends up vertical when the box is installed as shown in the instructions. If you carefully look at the product image, you can see the embossed name on the upper right portion of the cover. Seems a bit trivial, but if you are going to use this box inside your home, temporarily put the cover on and decide how you would like the box and cover oriented. Then you should to determine if the internal knockout holes will work for your application."
2,Amusing but flawed,"An amusing but flawed book. It makes a good read but cannot be relied upon as being very factual -- too many chapters rely on gossip and are strongly one-sided. The author needed to interview more people involved with certain productions. This book is fun to read, but is often inaccurate."
2,Not worth the theatre money but worth the DVD rental price,Ok I love Albert Brooks that is the only reason I made it thru this movie without either passing out completely only the scenes he was in did i stay awake or leaving altogether because even his character was not a developed one. Michael Douglas is now playing a cartoon of himself practically. Candice Bergen is a beautiful woman but she looks hideous inside and out in this thing. A bad taste it left in my mouth. I would not recommend this for theatre prices. DVD or VHS maybe.
1,Utterly Horrible,"The original is one of the funniest movies ever made. This thing is simply pathetic. Laughably bad script and terrible performances from some usually good actors. There is nothing funny in this waste of time. I rank it with ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" as the worst movies I have seen in years."
3,Hmmm,"This one was OK.However, I did enjoy the whole ""Fat Cobra"" which Jerry Peyser(Albert Brooks) did a great job with...though I did get quite irritated by all his questioning and insults to Steve Tobias(Michael Douglas). Michael did an excellent job as an undercover CIA Agent and that made it exciting, and all the antics that Jerry & Steve had to go thru together...but I thought Jerry sure could have cut out at least half his whining..."
2,Seen the 1st one? Skip this one,"I can't review this for those who never saw the original--but if you liked Peter Falk and Alan Arkin you'll be disappointed here. Face it Michael Douglas is not as funny as Peter Falk, not in this movie anyway. The opening scene clued me that this was not written as well as the first-- It was completely believable that Peter Falk could be too goofy to actually be an agent (Columbo?) and that made his role so much better but Michael Douglas is just not goofy enough.I just couldn't stay interested enough to even get to any laughs. Rent the original again, you'll have much more fun."
2,Nothing explained,"This book does a pretty terrible job of explaining anything. It seems to gloss over the theory very quickly, maybe assuming we already know it (in which case we would have no need for the book)!It has a few examples, which are decent in that they illustrate the ideas but they are not enough in number nor in variety. While doing the problems in the book whenever I get stuck I often find that the book is of no help in helping me understand, either because the examples are too specific or more often than not because there is no explanation at all.This book has a lot of great problems that I guess promote understanding (as someone else has mentioned), but it does nothing to help you solve them, and that's the major flaw of the book which is why I simply cannot give it more than 2 stars."
1,Wanna learn Calculus? Stay away from Stewart!!!!!!!!,"This book is not the worst book on calculus, but it's one of the bad ones. If you're a professor or already learned calculus, you'll probably won't have trouble following it. However, for students like me taking calculus for the first time in my life, I find it VERY VERY hard to follow. I ""was made"" to purchase this book because my school uses this book. .. Wanna learn Calculus? STAY AWAY FROM Stewarts calulus!"
2,difficult if you're new to calculus,"I recently completed the 3 quarter freshman calc sequence at Ohio State University with this book. Having not had calculus before, I found the book quite difficult throughout. Stewart would do well to improve the introduction of fundamental concepts, like the limit, chain rule and integration by parts; the explanations are almost invariably inadequate. This book is useless for the average person, and consistently frustrating for anyone motivated enough to wade through the text. My advice for anyone without prior calculus experience who's using this book is to also get the solutions manual and study guide, they can help to explain what is left unclear by this text."
4,Tricky,"I teach kindergarten and we were working on how to writings. This is a little hard for my kindergarten ears, but I think it will help me with my drawings for charts and other activities we do."
5,Great Fun,"We love our Beamo Frisbee, we had bought one about 8 years ago while on vacation in Seattle, I think it got lost in a move so we had to buy a new one. Very durable and flies great. My 8 year old and 10 year old can throw it pretty well but my 19 year old and I can really get it sailing pretty long distances. Its a blast."
2,Get the CDROM or video game instead,"The gameboard activity with interactive tv screen is really fun to play but only stays fun if your into playing gameboards over and over again. The two movies on this dvd you can watch on the disney channel on saturdays. Lots of commercial previews get annoying. Not enough value for the full price, get it cheaper if your still interested."
4,broader context for the Enlightenment writers,"Cope analyses seven British writers of the Enlightenment period - Rochester, Halifax, Dryden, Locke, Swift, Pope and Smith. He shows how many of their works reflect the major social and political issues of the time.He devotes a chapter to each writer. Thus you do not need to be familiar with all of the authors. But by comparing the chapters, you might also gain a deeper appreciation of a given writer. By seeing his works in a broader context furnished by his contemporaries."
1,Not what I had hoped for.,I was looking for a alternative to YooHoo chocolate drinks. Something with no sugar in it. Sadly these are not a suitable alternative. They taste like lightly chocolate flavored water with lots of carbonation. To put it bluntly I thought they were pretty horrible.
5,DIET EGG CREAMS,"I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS, BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ME TO HAVE MY BELOVED EGG CREAMS IN DIET FORM"
1,Sound is horrible on this TV!!!,I bought this Sharp Aquos and the picture is great BUT I had to turn the volume up all the way to the highest level (60) to make it audible. I will return this TV immediately. One should not have to purchase external speakers to hear a TV at a normal level. I would not under any circumstances suggest any person buy this TV.
5,"You want to buy a car come see me, if not get the F*** off mine !!!!!!!!!",What more can I say BUY THIS MOVIE.This is HEAT one.Like some people say the movie starts off slow. Sit back and enjoy the ride.
3,Tangerine Scream!!!,"I Thought that at times things seemed a bit dated in parts, Great Direction from Micheal Mann Awesome display by Jimmy but the soundtrack though it might have sounded fine in 1980!! almost ruins the film for mine. sounded as though i was watching a Sci-Fi Flick or Alien Nation!.Tangerine Dream Surely must have sounded like a passing faze in electronica even in 1980-81 But now, Boy!!! Just Plain Ruins it in my book.Sure would like to View the film WITHOUT The Soundtrack Though!."
2,"two stars, sad to say","There are at this time, 86 reviews and most of them quite favorable. I had really hoped to be among them as did my sister who also ordered one.I believe in the concept, I really do. It makes great sense and I'm curious if I wouldn't absolutely have loved it if I were still out West where water is scarce and a premium.However, water is not an issue here where it rains at least once a week, so the self watering is somewhat a moot (sp?) point and actually was 'the problem'.I ordered mine and set out on my deck. Two days later it rained and completely flooded the container, killing everything. Ok..so now what?With my sister's, her tomato plants grew large - but NO tomatoes!It was an expensive trial for both of us and left us completely unimpressed.Obviously, there's something I'm not understanding or doing right, but until then, anything I plant in the ground seems to do just fine."
5,EarthBox RB-EB-TRC-PBB Garden Kit Terra Cotta,"This earthbox lives up to its advertising. I will buy another one next spring. I grew herbs (basil, tyme and rosemary) and they are all growing in abundance. My cooking talents are better than ever and I owe it to these fresh herbs grown so easily in my EarthBox."
5,"Great, compact, planter",I bought two Earth Boxes because a friend has four and his vegetable production is incredible. It is only July first and my tomato plants are already five feet high. I love it!
1,So far very disappointed,This product is made from plastic! For some reason (terra cotta) I was expecting different.
2,not much there,"I was disappointed with this purchase which was mostly old silent shorts. There was one movie worth watching. If you like silents this may be ok for you, but this is certainly not the best of Laurel and Hardy"
1,Garbage.,"Bought this tent for an upcoming camping trip with some friends. First of all, I've set up a handful of different tents and I found this one to be the most difficult to work with. The poles just don't want to slide through the holes and constantly were getting snagged. The poles also felt pretty cheaply made for a 30$ tent(not saying 30$ is an expensive tent but I've used cheaper tents which imo had sturdier/better made poles). Anyways, after setting up the tent in my living room(test setup), I found that there was a dime sized hole in the bottom tarp of the tent, and 2 of the seams by the holding pins already had dime sized rips. Also, fitting 3 people in this tent is laughable. I am 5'11 and can barely lay down in the tent, maybe 3 children could fit in this tent, but definitely not 3 adults. Needless to say I am returning it to Amazon."
5,terrific computer game,"Pajama Sam is a fantastic computer game for many ages. My four and six-year-old sons love it. The little one needs a bit of help, but I enjoy playing it, too, so I don't mind helping at all. I also recommend Pajama Sam's other games: ""No Need to Hide When it's Dark Outside"" and ""You are What You Eat from Your Head to your Feet."" All other Humongous Entertainment games are also great: Putt Putt, Freddi Fish, and Spy Fox. All are very creative, funny, and very G-rated. We have most of them and my kids play them over and over."
2,Lionel company ain't what it used to be!,This trestle is not of Lionel quality. The whole thing is held together with little plastic nails that break when you try to put the parts together. I should have sent it back but my 10 year old grandson really wants to keep it. I am very disappointed.
4,The classic translation in a good format,"The classic translation's New Testament reprinted in an attractive format. Not overly extensive on notes, however. Still, a good edition to have."
2,disappointed,"When I received the earrings I got very disappointed because they are very very small. I had to sell them, my wife never wanted to wear them."
4,Memory Lane for Theme Park Geeks and Professionals,"This personal memoir gives great anecdotes and detailed information on the theme park business. It's essential for anyone involved in the industry to learn who developed it, how and why it evoled. Plus it's always great to hear about the personalities involved. Probably not a good choice for mildly interested types."
3,NOt Really What I thought it Was,It does what it says it does but is not as useful as it would appear to be. It turns off (everything)the TV as well as the stereo. So what if you want to listen to the stereo and not watch the TV?
2,LCG4 energy surge protector,"they are bigger than they look, clumsy and my son does not no which things should be in the hot spot. if i can get feedback on that, i would like it"
2,didn't work for me,"I tried this device.. i had high hopes. My main computer is a dell1720 laptop. I think it does not draw enough power, regulary, to make this device work. It had a habit of switch on and off.. quickly! I tried to adjust the power level, but to no avail. I was very afraid it was going to nuke all of my components by switching them on and off so quickly. Maybe if I had a regular desktop it would have worked out better. But who is buying those anymore?"
3,Not so smart strip,"The concept is great and when used on standard electronics, it seems to work well. However, I used one for my PC with two monitors and a desk light. The idea was when I turned on the computer the second monitor and light would also come on (and vice versa). However, I get this cyclying of on-and-off for second monitor and light. I have ""adjusted"" the strip several times but to no avail. It is really annoying. It also defeats the purpose if I plug the second monitor and lamp into the non-controlled outlets."
5,Brilliant Idea,"I wanted to have a fan in my stereo cabinet fire up only when the stereo was on, and a friend suggested a smart strip. So you plug the receiver (or whatever control device you want) into the main jack, and any of the items tied into the other jacks automatically fire up when the control device is turned on. Works great, no issue."
4,Works as advertised.,"Perfect ! I like to watch TV while I go to bed and this smart power strip makes sure that the power is off to my DVD player, WD media player and Netgear Widi receiver. I just put my TV on sleep mode and watch without worrying about falling asleep. It is reassuring to know that the power strip will have everything powered off when I awake.Also, everything has a standby mode light which seems to be waste of electricity, why must it be on standby mode when my TV is off? doesn't make sense!Two things that need to be improved are that the LCG3 cord it a bit too short for my purpose and I wish there was a sliding cover for the unused outlets."
2,Entertainment centers - forget it,"I wanted to have the cable box control the switched outlets but that never worked. Customer support said to do this and that but it never work to my satisfaction. Beware, if you want your cable box always active - in order to keep the TV guide and info for each channel - and everything else to be turned off, good luck."
2,Was great for a week,"I bought this to use in my office. I have a PC with two monitors, two printers and assorted other peripherals. I have the PC plugged into the main outlet, so when I power down the PC everything else goes off. It worked great for a week. But now when I shut down the computer everything seems to shut down but, then all of the peripherals start cycling on and off, on and off. So now I shut the strip down manually using the toggle switch after the PC shuts down.Disappointing.I have an electric heater plugged into a different outlet, thought there might be some power surge issue but I have been turning off the heater prior to turning off the PC and it makes no difference.I don't think there is anything with my PC that would be causing this, so I can only conclude that the power strip isn't so smart after all."
2,"Nice idea, but poor quality",Nice idea. Overpriced for what it is. Didn't last very long. Broke after less than one year.
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I purchased this smart strip after reading an article from my power company.It was suppose to save me money,but all it did was cost me more.It worked fine for about a month or so and no matter how I adjust this worthless thing it will not work.I bought 2 of theses and they both quit about the same time.Save your money and just unplug your equipment.What a rip off!!!!"
1,Utterly useless.,"Like anyone, I like the idea of saving energy. However, this so-called ""smart"" power strip turned my computer and other devices on and off at random intervals while I was trying to work, even after I adjusted the settings. Hopefully someone will market a smart power strip that actually works, but I found this one to be completely useless."
1,Doesn't work as advertised,"It would have been nice if this would have worked as it's supposed to. I wanted to primarily use it so the subwoofer would turn off when the TV is turned off. I was also trying to use it on 2 powered speakers and 2 wireless game adapters. Despite following the directions, adjusting the sensitivity did not make any of the units turn off. There wasn't any further adjustment to try. It's going back to Amazon."
2,Smart Strip LCG3 10 outlet auto switch,The concept is a good one and the unit is well constructed. I have a lot of trouble with the setting to shut off/on the ancillary equipment. It's a very sensitive adjustment that doesn't work reliably.
5,Money Saver!,"I purchased this to cut back on ""always on"" electronics that were running up my electric bill. The best feature is that you have an ""always on"" option while other items are cut off, all on the same strip. I can leave my DVR on to record while everything else is off and not sucking electricity. I also have one on my computer station, which allows the router to be on, but everything else shuts down. I was able to save over $300 last year by using these and changing to CFL light bulbs. Definitely worth the initial investment."
1,Worked for about 3 weeks,I got this device and it worked as advertised out of the box.After about 3 weeks the powerstrip will no longer automatically turn off.Returning this item.
4,Simple way to go green and save money,"If you know or heard about ""vampire"" outlets then you know that they suck electricty when in use and when not in use. By using this smart strip you cut down on some of those ""vampires"". It basically gives you the benfit of leaving your surge protector on and not having to unplug everything. I read about these and decided to buy one. At first it takes some getting used to but after awhile it all makes sense and you can tell others that you are going green :)."
5,Ideal Energy Saver,"This is the updated version of SmartStrip I bought a couple of years ago and it has more capacity than the older one. Fortunately, it seems to work just as well. I have it controlling my TV, VHS player, and DVD player based on whether my satellite box is on or off."
5,A MUST SEE!!!!!,This is an excellent rendering of a sensitive subject. Everyone does a great job. If you can see it it's recommended. Too bad it's not available on DVD. Too bad. Of course it is available on VHS for ludicrous prices. If you want to pay. But that's up to you. Keep an eye out for it on dvd. Who knows. Maybe somebody will pick it up and release it.
5,Just finished...,Not entirely comprehensive but a very good middle-ground text. Lot's of good images and very easy to read format. Highly recommended.
5,Just what we needed for our small job!,"My husband and I needed to move a large TV. We are in our late 50's and didn't want to strain anything. This worked like a charm for us to move the TV (weight 250lbs). One down side for others thinking of this: the two lifters should be of about the same height as the shoulder slings are not adjustable to bring the strap clasp to just below waist level on a short person(5'2"")."
1,Hazardous!,"This item made moving a dangerous proposition for us; setting items down was cumbersome and hurt your back, and items tended to shift on the lifting cable. It is much easier to just move the items by hand (or hire a mover to do it for you!)"
3,Not the easy to use on odd shaped items.,"We specifically bought this to move our old (extremely heavy) TV into the basement. The base of the TV is shaped like the letter ""D"" with the front flat and the back rounded. The problem was that it needed to be carried width wise to get in through the basement door and the strap kept sliding off the rounded edges. If it had a square base it would have worked perfectly. We did manage to get it moved by having the strap run under the very front of the TV. It worked but certainly wasn't as easy as expected. The weight distribution worked well and the straps were comfortable."
5,well made,It was heavy duty and well made. I would recommend it for anybody moving heavy things. Little hard getting the hang of using it but not bad.
5,the best moving tool since the wheel,this tool can help you get past almost any obstacle while moving anything the best buy for contractors in the appliance biz and any other ppl that install any heavy thing
2,it does not work like they say,this product is a does not work like intended i'm a delivery driver and i deliver applaiance to customer houses the straps get loses when your going up steps dont like it that at all
3,Not for Stairs,"I bought these to move out of my Apt on the 3rd floor. The goal was to move as much as possible with my wife, and I thought this would allow us to move all the furniture.First, I tried a 300 lbs Sony 36"" TV with my brother-in-law. The strap just slipped right out from under it as we stood up. I gave the Shoulder Dolly the benefit of the doubt, as the TV has all the weight in the front.The next day my wife and I tried to use it on a basic rectangle TV stand. We put the strap under the unit, and stood up. No problem. We walked towards the stairs, and it was fine. As soon as we started down one stair, the strap slipped and the stand fell to the ground. I put the Shoulder Dolly back in the box and sent it back today.In my opinion, this this is not reliable to use going down stairs. It may work fine for 1 story moves, but it's not worth the risk of it slipping and breaking your furniture."
4,Great Product,"The product worked great! As some of the other reviews state, it might need a new design for the shoulders. But to be honest, my friend and I would not have been able to move a fridge, washer and dryer, as easily as we did, without it.Definitely worth the money."
5,Unbelievablly true!,"I ordered this because it was an Amazon lightening deal and because my son is about to move. There were good reviews so thought I'd take a chance.Today I helped a friend move. It was unbelievably easy lifting the heavy appliances with this devise. We didn't have a regular dolly for the refrig, stove, washer and dryer and didn't need one because we had this shoulder dolly. Do not hesitate to get one of these. It almost makes moving items fun (okay, don't believe that). But do believe this: You'll lift with your legs, save your back, and find your efforts are doubled. I help friends a lot with their moves, so I think this may help my reputation. I'm 56, diabetic, and this devise works so well, that I thought it fair to give it a glowing review."
5,Makes moving an ease...,We had a friend that helped us move and he had a set of these. They made the move so easy and was a lot faster than a conventional dolly that we had to buy a set for ourselves (we felt bad barrowing their all the time). Definately a product you will use and is worth the money.
5,Works as advertised,"Had to move a heavy (~180 lbs) exercise machine to a different part of the house, including down one flight of stairs. The straps worked great, and made the move a breeze. Cannot comment on longevity since I have only used it once, but seems well-made."
2,"A little dry, but good information","If you can wade through the rather dry writing, you'll find some good information in this book. Although there are about two dozen pages devoted to Sloan's work (black and white) in his chronology, there are few visual examples of what Sloan is talking about, thus no shortcuts in grasping the message as he gives it.There is no doubt that this man was a very talented and accomplished artist, and it was disappointing to see poor quality photos of his work. His views are interesting in that he believed ""there is no progress in art...The man who scratched his concept of animals on the roof of a cave in Spain thousands of years ago, just had a space to work on and something to work with and he put down his ideas. That is what the artist does today."""
2,Grammar,There are better books to get this information. I was disappointed it its content.I am sorry I could not return it.
2,No Answer Key,The book has a huge flaw. There is not answer key. What is the point of exercises without answers to identify mistakes?
4,Helpfull,"Instead of reading this book cover to cover, read the question sections in each chapter. You'll learn a lot just from that."
4,HOLT Physics textbook,The purchase of this used text went smooth and without a problem. I received the book in the condition that was posted. It was shipped and arrived as promised.
1,Terrible Product - Frustration,"We bought these to use for my son's dodgeball tourney t-shirts and they were absolutely awful. They wouldn't adhere to the fabric and if they did, they tore when removing the backing. So frustrating when you've spent money and time for a special event only to have them not only not work, but worse, leave your project looking ghetto-homemade."
3,Suitable selection,"The silicone skin and the screen protector are the best of the kit, but the belt clip is very fragile. The bad thing of the silicone skin is that it don't have a hole for the rec button of the mp3 player. The armband is good. I think that is a good selection."
1,"Lots of errors, not useful for engineers","The claim of this book is to present ""next generation"" networks, however out of the 198 pages only 20 pages cover the enablers for these networks: LCAS and GFP. And even these sections are full of technological errors and are incomplete. Other sections in the book contain also many technological errors. This book contains more errors than his previous book ""Understanding SONET/SDH and ATM"". I get the strong impression that the author copy/pasted parts of the many references (20 pages!) without having the knowledge of the technology he tries to describe.A better book to read is: ""Next generation SDH/SONET: Evolution or Revolution?"" as this focusses completely on LCAS and GFP."
4,They seem kinda cheap but they look great,For 4 dollars it has quality. I was expecting a different kind of fabric of the fish net. But I tried them on and they turned my boyfriend on a lot so if they last long I think it's worth 4$. I paid nothing since I had a gift card so it's free for me
2,Higher Hopes,"I really hoped that by ordering a plus size they might stay up longer. However like most of the thigh highs I've tried, they roll down as soon as I pull them up."
3,"Good, but not great.","These stockings are good for their price, however don't expect them to last very long. I know the product listing says they don't need to be worn with a garter belt, but unless you want to be pulling them up every few minutes, then I'd suggest wearing one. The stockings themselves are very soft and stretchy, but I almost wish I'd ordered them in a smaller size. I am 5'8"" and 185lbs so I assumed the plus size would fit me better, but I found them to be a little loose, but I assume the garter belt would help this problem as well. Overall, if you're wearing them as a one time deal for a sexy night inside, then these will certainly do the job, but if you're looking for something that will last for a long time, and stay up on its own, then I'd suggest looking elsewhere."
3,Not what I expected,"When I bought the anthology, I expected to read about five women living their lives on the street. However, as I read the memoirs, I realized that my views of the homeless population were quite narrow and only identified with the stereotypical views associated with them. While a few of the memoirs did reinforce some of the negative characteristics tied to the homeless, it did also make me realize that homelessness can result from events completely out of a person's control. Overall, I felt that this collection of works was somewhat insightful, but it did not have a profound affect on me."
4,I Have Arrived Before My Words,"Have you ever wondered what life would be like, before and after being homeless? Deborah Pugh and Jeanie Tietjen, put together a great autobiographical layout of five homeless women, and how they have coped with their problems. This is a book about five women who have struggled in America from either drugs, abuse, or neglect, and became homeless at one point in their lives. Pugh and Tietjen don't write these womens stories they just edit and comment on them. Each women tells her own story the way she saw it. This book makes you understand what happens before and after these women became homeless. It's a great book and I recommend it to anyone interested in autobiography's of homeless women."
3,Andrew Y. Engl 100 AL,"Although i was pretty much forced to read this book, it was a pretty interesting read. The book showed that these 5 women had to go through so much pain and there were only several ways that these women coped with the pain."
5,Cats crazy about these,"Based on my experience with our six cats, I can't imagine any cat not devouring these. We have a cat with hyperthyroidism who needs a pill twice a day. Two of our other cats routinely run over when its pill time to see if I'll give them a tiny piece of the pill pocket, and the other three non-medicated cats would readily gobble these up too if I let them. Not to mention the cat who is supposed to be getting them. She's normally a whiner (unusual in cats) but loves these and readily takes them twice a day. Before now, we've had cats for many years and periodically had to give one of them pills; this is by far the easiest method I've run across. Good thing if one has have to give a cat pills as frequently as twice every day, indefinitely."
4,A great collection of children's songs. Lots of favorites!,"There are many fun songs in this collection,including Muppet favorites, nursery rhymes, Disney and songs such as Puff the Magic Dragon, Mairzy Doats and Yellow Submarine. I particularly like the piano arrangements."
1,Don't buy this headset,"This headset is terrible. The microphone portion constantly falls off of the earclip. The earclip is very uncomfortable on your ear. The microphone is so bad that no one can hear what you say. After trying to use this on a very important 6 hour teleconference, I ended up throwing it in the trash and just holding the phone to my ear. Don't buy this product."
4,Escape Science Fiction,"This book is mainly background for the Laiden universe; however, it is a great way to escape from the stress of an everyday world. It will also givee you insight into the agent of change series that is core to the Laiden univrese. It is an excellent read for a rainy day or to kill time in a plane terminal between flights. Give it a try!"
4,"Very heavy, sturdy","Not as difficult to put together as I anticipated, but does require a hammer. Looks nice."
4,joyfull noise,"i was very pleased by the work that My Morning Jacket put out on this album. they are awesome thought, so i wasnt surprised! off the record would have to be one of my favorites on this one ; )"
1,b**ds didn't say it was copy protected,I bought it on understanding it was aregular CD - it wants to load software onto my PC before i can play it - well get lost !!!Can i have my money back please - you can have the CD backNot that good or interesting or original
1,"Take this ""jacket"" off! It's copy protected!",I burst into tears when I heard that this CD is copy protected because I am a HUGE fan of My Morning Jacket! Why do the record labels want to make life so hard for consumers?! I hate copy protected records and refuse to be BULLIED into buying them! I refuse! REFUSE!
5,masterful,this is my fav My Morning Jacket cd.came in good shape with a nice personal note from the seller.thank you!
4,sony changing stance on copy protection,"It appears that Sony has decided that XCP copy protection is a bad idea. They just announced that:- they were no longer going to manufacture CDs with this software- they are urging distributers to immediately stop distributing CDs with the technology (hear that Amazon!)- they are offering free exchange for non-XCP versions to those of us that purchased the copy protected version.http://cp.sonybmg.com/xcp/By the way, My Morning Jacket and their record label never condoned this practice and apparently had no choice in the matter.http://www.atorecords.com/?title=news+and+press&mdid;=532"
1,CD will not work on Mac,Do not buy this CD if you are using a MAC. It will not work. What a rip off.
5,"Awesome album, no suprise","There is a way to get around the copy right that's on the CD. Once you rip it using Windows Media Player 9, you just take those songs and burn them to a CD, using Windows Media Player 9. Now take that CD and import it into your iTunes library. Doing this takes off the security protection on the files.Oh yeah, and the CD is great. MMJ's sound is ever growing, and even just now (I bought the CD today) I think that it's better than ""It Still Moves."" I wouldnt have gone through that lengthy explanation if I didnt think people should hear how great this music is."
5,perfect bike beam,This bike beam is superb. It is much more secure than other avaiable options. It has secured my bike for several weeks without complications.
2,As light as air,"A light and undemanding read. Little more than a list of the hits of the late '70s with some specious analysis that is as shallow as a puddle. Not unentertaining, maybe good for a short flight or train journey."
2,"Good, but not good enough","Liner fits bathtub niceline and is easy to inflate. Colorful and does the job but can only be used if your baby is a ""sitter"" in the tub and doesn't try to pull up on the tub sides as the cushion doesn't go all the way to the top, much less over the top of the tub at all. Would be so much better if it extended up a little over the top of the tub wall.Also, suction cups are large but don't hold to the rounded corners of the tub at all, so comes off and floats up during every bath. Not using it anymore..."
1,Just a bad book,"I belong to a bookclub through Leisure Books. Every month, I get two new horror titles. This was one of them.I just couldn't find anything redeeming in this book at all. I didn't find any of the characters sympathetic. I did not care for any of them. In fact, one that replused me the most was ""the survivor"". After what she did, I didn't want her to survive.Some may say this book is bringing to light the snuff film trade and its atrocities. But truly, how many people are going to seek information on this vile subject from a mass market paperback?The author went way beyond what he should have. Yes, the description on the back covers let's you know this is going to be a gruesome book. However, it doesn't tell you that an infant girl gets raped, pulled apart and partly eaten, in front of her mother in a snuff film.I seriously considered not finishing the book, however I wanted to review it and felt it best to read the whole thing.Awful, just awful."
3,Where's the barf bag,"This novel is totally sick. Duh! It's about snuff films. Some of the characters are great, and I really like how this was a short story that he expanded into a full-length novel. I like what he did. That's one bada** grandma!"
1,"Bad, bad, bad","I'm no prude--I've read the some of the hardest of the hard-core horror. However, there's hard-core and then there's just nasty. This book made me feel dirty after reading (most of) it.This is the kind of book that Amazon should provide negative stars for."
1,no TAB,I'm sure this is a great bookand aspiring jazz musicians should be able to read music but .. i would not have bought this book had i known there is no tablatureif you dont read musicdont buy it
4,"A reader from Newark, Delaware","This was a great book! I couldn't put it down. It defiantly provided new insight into the development of anorexia nervosa. Although this was fiction, I found it believable. It avoided the oversimplification of a very complex disorder. I look forward to reading more work by Stephanie Grant."
5,Excellent book!,"This is an excellent book! It is much more than a recipe book, and is a recipe for long life and health as well. It describes the negative health results of constantly ""feasting"" in this country, and shows how a much simpler approach to eating can bring health and longevity. The author and spouse lived an active life to their late 90's and rarely if ever were sick. This book explains why."
4,Popular science with an entertaining hook,"A brief (256 pages, but the print is fairly large and there are a few pictures from the comics) and entertaining analysis of the powers and characteristics of Superman through the lens of real science. The author does not puncture the fantasy but weighs the possibilities and outlines the obstacles while explaining a fair amount of physics, mechanics, and biology along the way. Lois Gresh's ""The Science of Superheroes"" covers similar-but-broader territory in perhaps a more concise manner, but this book covers what it does with a bit more depth."
5,superman and science---a logical union and a good book,"this handsome book takes us where so many superman writers have been -- to the place where science and science fiction meet. if you ever considered how the man of steel could do what he does, this book cogently attacks the science behind it.nicely illustrated and fun"
1,Just like George,"We also had the ""err"" message on the digital display after a little less than three months. Fortunately we're able to return for a full refund. Please save your money - hunk 'o junk that works great for a while to lull you into a false sense of security than - wham - useless!!! I'd put zero stars if I could."
2,Disappointed,I bought this fryer 3 months ago and was thrilled with it at first. It has all the features I was looking for-- in particular that it was fully washable and it had a drain spout. The only thing I didn't like was that the temperature selections were pre-set and I couldn't vary the temp to EXACTLY what I wanted. It wasn't that big of a deal though. But after using the machine about a month I started getting an error message on the LED screen and the machine would shut off. I always reset it pretty quickly so I could continue to use it. The messages came more and more often and today I cannot use the machine at all-- it instantly goes to the error message and I cannot use it and I cannot cook my lunch the way I wanted to. I'm very disappointed that this machine didn't even last me 3 whole months. I've emailed DeLonghi--- I hope they'll help (I never send in product registrations but I think this time I've learned my lesson)
2,Good Story...Bad Grammar,"Although the story is interesting and the book is a quick read, it was VERY hard to read becuase of all the typos and strange grammar mistakes. Shame on any publishing company for putting out a book like this! YOu might still consider it if you're a fan of good paranormal happenings, but you just have to give in to the bad grammar."
4,Interesting,"This was an interesting review of the 20th Century from the eyes of he Brits, so it is worth watching."
2,Nice idea but dont waste your time,I bought these stickers to put on the celiing they don't stick very good and fall off so if you are looking to put them on your ceiling look for other stickers. Milky Way glowin the dark stickers are the best so far
2,Didn't hold up to use...,"Bought this set for a vacation rental home and that being said, it is possible the guests threw the peppermill against the wall to break it, but I doubt it. I was not durable or intuitive enough for use in a vacation rental home and broke. We replaced it within 1-2 months. Might do better in the loving care of its owner's own home. Salt shaker is still holding up fine."
2,Sad...,"I bought this for my little boy for Christmas and even got him a messenger bag to put it in and while the idea was nice...the reality was not. Its really cheaply made, junky and not much for the child to do on it.Skip this one...not worth the money."
2,wont work right or atleast for me,"Giving honor to God who is the Head of my life to my awsome Pastor and First Lady and all to whom honor is due.The case is pretty in picture, but once you get it; it wont stay on your phone correctly. I took some tape for mine, i would recomend it. But maybe i just got a bad one. Your chose.God Bless you all!Go to Immanuels Temple Community Church, ITCC in Lansing,Michigan. 517-887-5856 or call 1800BeHoly! God Bless again."
5,great,What can I say...it was great to see an earlier version of the Cathedrals. I have seen later in-person concerts with the later tenors but this was great for viewing and hearing them at an earlier stage in their careers.
5,The Cathedrals. Travelin' Live,"I have been very pleased with the service I received during this transaction. I love this group and have followed them for a very long time now, and have many of their DVD's it was lovely to see the group as younger men on this DVD."
2,NOT what I was hoping for,"This is a catalog of the Huntington art collections (like what you might find at an auction house). It is NOT a coffee table book, with beautiful pictures of the grounds or the art. In fact, the only color picture is the cover. It is NOT a history book, with lots of background about the Huntingtons and their collection. It is NOT an art book, with descriptions, analysis and interpretations of the art. It is just--a catalog. Ho hum."
5,Good quality and fast delievery,"We are happy with what we purchased. We got the items just before we started our holiday baking.All went well, and thanks the vendor for the products."
3,Dancing challenged,"Unless you have some kind of dance background, this workout is a little tough. Jamie shows you each routine at a slow pace, but steps it up a notch too quick. It takes me a while to catch on and this went way too fast for me."
1,Very Buggy Application,"GoLive CS is a very buggy application. Despite running on a very stable Windows XP system (2.8ghz cpu, 2048mb RAM, 2x WD 7200 80gig HD), GoLive repeatedly freezes forcing you to kill the application from the task manager. Additionally, functions within the app such as FTP Browser will freeze or fail when transferring even benign text files or simple HTML files.This program is very frustrating, has a number of show stopping bugs that are still waiting to be patched and certainly nothing like the quality we have come to expect from an Adobe product.This product is terrible and should be removed from store shelves immediately."
2,Not Even Close!!!,I agree with the above listed comment! Adobe has renamed key functions like floating boxes to layers and rearranged the locations of common tools found in previous versions. Adobe must have decided that after pulling this stunt with Photoshop 6 it was GoLive's turn. What are they thinking? Being a web designer the last thing I want to do is relearn a software package that I have been using forever. The only reason I am giving GoLive two stars is the new intergraded PDF functions that should be included in all of Adobe's software.
5,Wilton 6-muffin pan,I needed a six-muffin pan since sometimes my twelve-muffin ones could not accommodate all the batter. It is perfect and I don't know why I waited so long to get one. The wider sides at the top make removing the hot pans from the oven so much easier - and safer. I am very pleased with this sturdy pan.
2,Junky,"Fisher-Price toys are junk these days. My son does like it so I am glad I bought it, but this toy is definately not worth the money. The barn doors didn't make noises when they were opened. I didn't want to have the hassle of sending it back and getting a new one so I took the bottom off to see if I could fix it myself. The circuit board in it looked AWFUL. I don't know how those soldered connections passed quality control (if there is any quality control). I managed to super glue a bit of cardboard so the the switch would work. The only reason I am not fuming is because I got it off Toys r Us when they had buy one get one free on FP toys..and I had a $5 gift card.Not impressed at all."
4,like it for the most part,My mom has the original f.p. barn that is completely enclosed. I think kids like hiding the animals in there but it is what it is. My son enjoys playing with it but it doesn't keep his attention like the original for some reason. The animals and noises are fun. A good purchase overall.
5,wonderful toy!,my twins just love this farm. it helped them learn animal sounds and it keeps them entertained for a long time!
3,Boring for those over 3,"My daughter had this from her toy library one week. She just turned 4. She found it very boring, as did I. It would be ok for a 2 year old.Very heavy and bulky, and not much to do with it.Personally, I'd buy Playmobil 123 for a young child. It's more interesting, also more aesthetic. This is kinda ugly."
3,Some have been recalled!!,I would suggest staying away from this toy used. Some have been recalled. I don't believe that FP fixed the barn problem and find this toy dangerous and extremely overly priced. I would suggest a simple puzzle over this toy! My child maybe played with this toy for a total of three months!
1,This is lame,"We got this for my son's 3rd birthday......... it makes no sense and is so boring, he hates it. The chicken slides back and forth (non-removeable), and all that this does is make sounds when you open barn doors and then you have a bunch of plastic farm animals. Don't buy it. The toys in the 70's by fisher price were way cooler."
5,Entertaining toy,Our 20 month old received this as a gift for Christmas. It is by far the toy she plays with the most. She loves putting all of the animals where they go and then hearing the sounds they make. She sets up an entire farm in her bedroom and it entertains her for quite sometime. We love all the Little People collections.
4,Audio Visual fun for your baby,My baby is very picky about the toys he plays with ... but he's mesmerized by the farm. It's visually stimulating and the audio part helps also ... Highly educational!!!
1,Warning,"I loved the first one soo much and loved this second one as well to up until a point, but in the end, I ended up hating this whole series with a fiery passion. Read at your own caution. It's a good book, but...well, read at your own caution."
1,Picturequality of TERROR!!!,"So much Movies for a cheap price, but the real horror is thrilling you when you see the Quality of the Picture.""The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave"" is cut. Probably some more.Mill Creek Entertainment was so kind to superimpose a Company-Watersign in the Movie which appears more then once.Clear Statement: Hands off this rubbish!!!"
3,Burgundy,"I found the information, the review, the opinion of this book is not that useful, because the information content is out of date. An updated version will be helpful."
3,A book alive with history,"It was with great trepidation that i stared to read this book, being knowledgable of the myth and history. But , and i will admit this..i was very pleasantly surprised. This book has it all..love, passion, and arrows!! A must read!"
2,GARY JENNINGS IS THE BEST!,"Be very careful. This book is NOT written by Gary Jennings. He's dead. The new books don't have any of his flavor, not his witty writing. If you buy any of his REAL books you'll read a masterpiece.* Aztec (1980) : A story of the Aztec empire just before and during the arrival of the Spanish.* The Journeyer (1984) : An account of the travels of Marco Polo to the Far East.* Spangle (1987) : A chronicle of the lives of carnival entertainers.* Raptor (1992) : Thorn, a hermaphrodite, and his/her adventures in a post-Roman world."
2,Not Gary Jennings,"As other readers have expressed, this is based on Gary Jennings Aztec Triology, since the author was long dead when this book came out. Lacks most of Jennings research and creative flair, and focuses more on sexual exploits than storytelling. Jennings always explored the sexual aspects of his characters, but only to enhance the story, not focus on it. By the end of the book I found myself not caring about the protagonists fate, which is a bad sign. Read it if you have to, but don't expect the past greatness"
2,"Aztec ""Hormonal"" Rage","This book is just plain silly! While I enjoyed some of the historical aspects of it such as the exploration with Carlos and the information about the French occupation of Spain. I found the sexual exploits of Juan downright offensive. Not from a prudish standpoint, but as an adult, it was just so juvenile. Who wrote this book?!?! Seems to me, it was written by an adolescence boy who hasn't had an intimate relationship but has read too many Penthouse Letters."
5,the joy of contemplation,"I've read, re-read and look forward to re-reading this book again just to savor the author's choice of words that he uses to weaves a tapestry of textures for the senses as he and his partner restore their ""least worst"" land to health over 20 years. He describes their joy and surprise of constantly making new discoveries, ""it's like receiving lovely gratuitous gifts that you didn't even know you wanted."" They ""engaged in the contemplative exercise of watching"" the effects of the wind blowing the grass, the texture of seasonal changes, marvelous sunsets, and wildlife, sometimes at arms reach. His descriptions bring back memories of enjoying my favorite, frequently, visited forests in a similar manner, wondering what new gift will be presented to me as I quietly listen to the sounds, feel the wind in my hair, and watch the shadows play with the sunbeams.reader"
3,Settle things and move on,"While I enjoyed the initial series, the internal strivings of the Seated Blending is getting overdone and distracting. I've gotten so I skip over the infantile tantrums and high school relationships.If you read this book, focus on the nobles who were sent West to help recover the wasted lands. Those people are interesting; they develop and grow. Pay attention, as well, to the middles and their instructors learning how to develop their own skills and the troubles that arise there. These two areas are much more complicated and enjoyable to read.The Blending has become redundant and, frankly, annoying. If one more of them sleeps with another person, I think I may give up all together. I can only hope the next book will finally settle the relationship issues so the Blending can move on with problems outside of themselves."
2,Lukewarm,"Very simply, this machine does not make hot coffee. Unless you like yours lukewarm, you'll be putting your coffee in the microwave after brewing. Tastes good, but just not hot enough."
5,Good discussion regarding speaking assessment,"Most factors regarding speaking assessment were discussed in the book.Especially the most well organized part is which features should be considered in the speaking test.As a person who are studying phonetics, this book is worth to read thoroughly."
3,"fairly decent player, does its job","Pros:very nice size and very lightthe screen is decent and lights up well in different colors (red, green, blue, purple, etc)voice recorder is good and picks up noise from a distance so you don't have to have it right at your mouth to record (but it does crackle a little in plackback)it is easy to navigate the music menus but not the other menusCons:the buttons are a little wonky, and seem pretty flimsythe menu navigation is weird and everything is abbreviated so its hard to tell what things meanno belt clipthe headphones it comes with muffles the music. when i had them plugged in i had the volume comfortably at 23 then when i plugged my headphones in i had to turn it down to 15 because 23 was waaay too loudoverall this is a good mp3 player for the money. i got it for running and i wanted something light and inexpensive so if i dropped it, i wouldn't mind too much."
1,"Good card, but be careful.","Turtle Beach does not provide updated drivers for newer operating systems. If you use a Turtle Beach card, you are almost guaranteed to be force to throw it away the next time you change Operating System. Buyers beware!"
2,What a Disappointment!,"Please ignore the ""unhelpful"" rating given to my review by Turtle Beach employees.When running the driver CD-ROM, no multi-media player is installed, so that means no file types are associated with their software. There is no media library. There is no CD or DVD burning software installed, either.This is just a bare-bones sound card, folks. That's it and nothing else.So what DO you get? Dolby Digital Live (DDL) 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound. This is a great feature if you have multi-channel speakers. If you don't, this product is a waste of your money.Regardless of what audio hardware a buyer may or may not have, I still think it's a waste of money, anyway. For a little more cash here at Amazon, everything this card has plus a whole lot more--including Dolby Digital Live--is available from any Creative Labs Titanium-series board. (And I'm not a Creative Labs employee.)"
4,Towers of London,"Purchased this from Amazon after being unable to find it locally and being quoted $30-$40 Aussie for my local CD shop to import it.Tried the trusty Google, found Amazon, had my CD from the other side of the planet for a total cost of $15 Aussie.Very Happy Chappy."
1,A Nation on Trial,"Finkelstein and Birn's book is a revisionist, outrageous attempt atdefending the most indefensible people of all time. This workdemonstrates almost no scholarly support, but rather is a sweepinggeneralization that fails to refute a single principle of DanielGoldhagen. Goldhagen, while lacking some basis for his book""Hitler's Willing Executioners,"" comes under attack forindicting the Nazis for an act that Finkelstein does not even believeoccurred in the form most of the world agrees with.-- it is factless, and a waste of time."
1,THIS BOOK IS A NIGHTMARE!,"I just turned 21 & was playing around with the idea of becoming an exotic dancer. There are many books out there that talk about strippers, but most are about their lives. I bought this book because it was a GUIDE book.Well, I was totally dissapointed in the first 5 minutes of reading it. This stripper(Jewels) only brags on and on non-stop about stuff that is so irrelevant. Unfortunately, I read all these reviews after I bought the book.Grace gives more details as to what she claims to have accomplished more than she does about the actual dance moves. I don't think there's anything I can add to this review that hasn't been covered already, one thing I will add is that this book was a TOTAL waste of my money. I don't recomended this book to anyone, not even the bored housewife!"
3,Hangs up on a Scott release,The Ultra Nock sometimes hangs up when using an older Scott release. There is a warning about this on the package in fine print at the bottom on the back. The warning specifically sites the Scott release. I tried it anyway. I don't know if there are problems with other types of releases. It also gives the string a louder twang. There was a little loss (about 2ft/sec) of measured average speed. If it works with your release its not all bad. I do like the adjustablity and way it aligns the peep sight. Based on the problem with release I am going back to a string loop.
4,Condition on arrival,"This is a good product, however there was visible damage to the product which I repaired. The damage was due to the manufacturer's box was not placed in another box for shipping."
3,Just Okay,"This bra fits a little tight. I got bras from the same company and the same size, so I know that this one runs smaller."
2,Nipples can be noticed with this bra,"I really like Warners bras, of which I have 4, the best I've worn, very comfortable. This one is very nice, very soft fabric and beautiful design. But the cup fabric is thin and the shape of the nipples can be perceived through it. I had to return it."
5,great addition!,"My ""just 2 year old"" nephew loves this newest addition to his Thomas train set. The lighthouse has both fog horn sound and seagulls. Plus, the working light -- a bit dim unless you turn the lights off in the room. Between pushing a ""button"" (the top of the lighthouse) to make the noises and being able to lift the bridge -- my little one is deeply engaged. Plus, it goes perfectly with his book, ""Wave Hello to Thomas."" There's a page where you lift a flap to open the bridge, but it was a bit hard for the concept to be understood on a page -- until he saw it really working-- and could manipulate it himself. I admit, I rather enjoy it too! Just be sure to turn the switch to off under the lighthouse. I didn't realize there was a switch, and the battery died overnight after only one day of playing with it."
2,Tears,Needed tarp to cover Jeep. It tore almost immediately on edge of license plate without much tension applied. Rather thin construction and not durable.
1,Heynoose,"Yuck. I'm not one for analyzing music, just for enjoying it or being moved by it. This album frustrates on both counts. Junk."
5,Ballet Classics,Anyone who has the slightest interest in classical ballet should purchase this. The filiming is crude by today's standards it doesn't matter.The dancers are spellbinding. Classic dancing at its best.
5,Wonderful winter beauty.,"One may feel a sense of gloom and doom as winter closes in. But Ken Libbrecht shows us the astounding beauty that only comes in winter -- in the intricate designs of snowflakes. Libbrecht's exquisite photographs of snowflakes have appeared in a number of books, and have been honored by the U.S. Post Office on postage stamps. This little book is a wonder. It show a miniature miracle of creation in each unique snowflake. And with each picture come captions discussing the science behind their beauty, as well as literary quotes relating to snow and nature. With no two exactly alike among the billions that fall, snowflakes are a magically beautiful picture of the infinity of the Creator."
5,"Axion 7"" DVD Player","I just got this today, charged the battery and tried several different types of media. It plays everything. The unit has small speakers and does not come with headphones, but comes with a li-ion battery, car charger cord and audio video cord as well as a small remote.I plan to use this during air travel. The planes I fly usually do not have movies, and a movie takes away some of the boredom of flight.Being curious in nature I gave it the treatment, testing to see if it would skip by holding it on angles and giving it a little rough handling. It looks good. I am hoping it will last for a while so I can get some use out of it during air travel. We'll see how it takes the buffeting and landing bumps, not to mention the rough handling carry ons sometimes get.I would like the carry case. Mine did not come with one. Need to see if I can get one. sax"
5,"Absolutely spellbinding, witty amd incisive.","Dalrymple has penetrated the soul of Middle Eastern religions.I agree with him in that Christianity is an Eastern religion and he has exposed to us the jewels that reflect the true Church.On the side he has masterfully depicted the the ufortunate fate of the Kurds,and the Armenians before them, at the hands of the Secular Turks.Its odd that Christians feel threatened in democratic Israel but feel safe and content in dictatorial Syria.It is the book of the year 1999-2000."
4,Multi-functional,"We also used this netting last spring/summer/fall on our double stroller (limosine style) and our pack-n-play. In addition to bugs, it keeps leaves, etc. from falling into the play pen. My in-laws loaned us a second play-pen that was older and larger than the one's sold these days. The netting also fit that but not as snugly."
2,This book needs an editor; its readers need patience.,"For a science text of this type, Sato's book is unusually difficult to read. Its awkward, imprecise, often ambiguous wording is distracting--I find myself asking, ""What does he mean?"" more often than I ask, ""How does that science work out?"" That said, the book is reasonably thorough (covering precisely what the title says it does) and a patient reader (fresh graduate student or ripe undergraduate) might learn a thing or two. There are no problems (or solutions). The figures are poor."
1,Terrible product. I wish I would have read reviews.,"This memory card literally failed the second time I used it in my camera. I was on a once-in-a-lifetime trip, and lost over 400 meticulously created photos. I/O error appears to be unrecoverable even after trying several data recovery programs. I am absolutely furious. I haven't yet talked to customer service, but from the sounds of it, that will likely be fruitless.DO NOT BUY THIS CARD!"
1,"Piece of junk, stay away!!!!!","I recently bought this SD card for my Nikon Digital SLR, and head to reorder it two times and never got one that actually worked, dont waste your time, stay away form this one unless you just like getting headaches!!"
1,"Just Roll Over, Tony",Never could and still can't ... understand how Tony ever made a living as a singer. Ruined the effort of Bill Evans for my money. Sad!
2,"This book is design for non verbal, not verbal children","This book is very helpful to parents who child does not talk. But for children that do talk, this is not a book that teaches verbal skills. I purchase this book for my verbal child and when I finish reading it, I found it to be a waste of money."
4,The Best of...,"I never got into Dinosaur jr before. I really dont know why! But this was the perfect chance to catch up. It may take a few listens to like, but once you get to know the songs, they wont get out of your head. If you never heard these guy before, they sound like a mix between the pixies and nirvana...if that makes any sense. but these guys have been around a long time before them. anyway, great album. pick it up. also check out the new billy joel's greatest hits. also a good one."
5,An *AMAZING* Fantasy Story,"I absolutely loved this book! It has a gripping plot line, that firmly holds your attention until the very end. The character development is superb, with awesome details. Woven throughout the storylines are interlocking sub-plots, where everything comes together for one climactic ending at...where else, the Lake of Dragons.I can't wait for new titles by this author!"
1,Too hard for me,"I have been exercising faithfully with Leslie Sansone for months. I wanted to bump up my level of exerion so bought this. The steps are not easy for someone who is not music or coordination inclined. I felt like it was difficult dance steps. I could not keep up with Chris Freytag and got frustrated. I gave up on this DVD, but am able to follow the simple exercises of her Get Moving DVD..So I am back to Leslie Sasone, and Get Moving. I do find Chris Freytag a little too chipper for me. I want to exercise and not be distracted. I love Leslies's personality!"
5,It's a light bulb,It's just a light bulb but I have to say a year later and it is still going. I literally replaced the original a month after getting the microwave and this one is still nice and bright compared to the other original one which is dim and looks like it is going to die any day now.
5,Makes SENSE!,"This is a great book. Some family, good friends, and I used this book as a learning tool almost 30 years ago. It gives a biblical, easy to understand view of prophecy from the Word about events that were unfolding then, and now, in the Middle East. Although everyone may not agree on all views presented, it is a very good book to use to help understand what is going on around us."
4,Best one I Have Seen,"First, This model looks better than the others I have seen. The timer function is a little awkward but not too bad. THe timer works like one of those timers you set to your lights at home but every 15min wich is way too much for a 24hr period. The timer squeeled for 2 days when I got it. It works by a rotating wheel. Bu after that it stopped and works great now. Definitly worth the extra money."
4,Pleased with product,The product is quiet and radiates heat throughout the room rather quickly. There is no odor. Product took much longer to ship than we were originally told.
2,The timer is too noisy,"It heats up nicely, but the timer is definitely noisy. This will probably not bother some people, but it bothers me. I ordered two but sent one back. It's also not that easy to figure out how to set it. I'll probably buy one with a digital timer."
4,heats well but timer doesn't work right,"This heater is is warm and completely silent.I'd read the reviews about the smell, so I ran it outside for several hours before bringing it in, and it was fine.The problem is the programming dial. It must be broken. I set the timer and leave and when I check it again the time is wrong. For example, 12 hours later, it's only showing 11 hours later. I couldn't figure out what was going on, until the other day I heard a strange noise coming from it, like a little squeal. After pushing it around and tilting it, I pushed the timer. And it clicked and stopped. So there's something wrong with it. And I was very careful never to turn it the wrong direction, as the pamphlet instructed.I'm going to exchange it. Too bad; I'm happy with it otherwise and I don't want to be cold waiting for a replacement."
2,Inadequate,"Years ago, I had two Delonghi oil filled radiators, also rated at 1500 watts, and this unit is definitely inferior to the older ones. It is made of thinner metal, has thinner paint, and gives off less heat. Following the advice by the reviewers here, I let it run on my porch for 8 hours to burn off some of the initial smell. The first two nights I used it for heating, the fumes it gave off were more noticeable than the heat.Update: I bought this radiator to use in my 11x10 bedroom expecting it would enable me to turn down my furnace at night, but it doesn't. I've run it now for four nights on high in different parts of the room, and it raises the temp just one or two degrees. So I'm lowering my rating to 2 stars, and I'll probably be giving it away."
5,Delonghi TRD0715T Safe Heat Oil-Filled Radiator,"Great product,I'm using it in an unheated bedroom. Sufficiantly heats the room using the low setting. Also has saved me money on my gas bill since I keep an even temp in the bedroom."
5,A LIFE SAVER,"I live in an old mobile home that needs a new furnace. Since I own the house but not the land, I'm reluctant to buy one unless I have no choice. So I researched and found this product to be excellent. It has three settings and the oil system feels extremely safe. I've turned the main furnace down much lower (just enough to keep the pipes warm) and this unit keeps the living room and kitchen at 70 - 72 for about $45-50/mo. This is only for about 5 months and since the main furnace only goes off aboout one third as much, I suspect I will save on oil while extending the life of the furnace."
5,Excellent product,"Warm up my 15x13 bedroom quickly. It's a lot more comfortable than the forced air central heating system, which makes the airdry. The timer function is great. It's very quiet except fora few tiny click sound each day (you won't hear it unless it's very quiet), probably from the timer."
4,Great heater for the price,"We live in a little cabin with no insulation, and this heater has no problems keeping our bedroom warm.My only beef is that it is slightly noisy, but it is well worth what we paid for it."
4,Oil Heater,"The heater was rated best by Consumer Reports and I can see why, very safe, provides excellent heating"
2,Defective product,"We have owned many of these heaters over the years, using them in apartments we owned. We did not hesitate to buy another.However, the one we received is defective and we will begin its return immediately. The very first week we began using it, it started leaking oil. We have never had this in any of the other units we have owned.We will be returning for an exchange immediately. I am eager to see how smoothly this goes. My first communication will be with my credit card company, advising them of the need to return this purchase.S. Graumlich"
4,"Good heater, but HOT","I was pleasantly surprised at how well this heater works. So far it has kept my kitchen and living room a comfortable 68 (kitchen is 8x10 and living room is 20x14 connected by a large archway). My only concern is that it does get very HOT to the touch so I do not run it when the grandkids are visiting. Otherwise, a great little heater."
5,Love the heater,very happy with the heat it put out. able to leave on all day without the cord getting hot or worry of overheating.
3,One Problem,"Just a short review with one concern. First this is a great heater as stated in all of the other reviews, that is why I bought it. Heats up quite slow but that is what oil filled heaters do, does not use a lot of energy/electric which is a big plus.The concern is that I live in the west which as we all know is desert and very dry. After using the heater for a few weeks my skin became dry, mostly on my face, this had not been a problem before, I had to start using a lot of cream on my face because of the dryness, it has warmed up here the last few weeks so I have not used the heater and the dry skin has gone away.I do not remember reading this in any of the other reviews but this is a big problem. Since winter is almost over this is something I will have to deal with next winter."
2,not for anyone with an above-average sense of smell,"The bad smell this thing emanates persists, albeit at much lower levels, even after 4 months of use. It heats my medium-sized room very well and rapidly, but it dawned on me that it's a bit stupid to have a heater that requires me to leave all the bloody windows open in the middle of winter. It may just be my unit though; if most people didn't have a problem with it, it's probably safer to think that their experience will mirror yours."
1,Planned Obsolescence,"This POS died in less than a year; just long enough to void out any warranty. I used it for part of the winter of 2008, and after less than two weeks use in 2009 it no longer heats. If you don't mind buying a new one every year, though, it heats very nicely."
1,Not worth,"It heats well but you will experience only if you are sitting next to the heater. If you are 3 feet away, you will not notice heating effect even after 3-4 hours. I still decided to use. After an year, wheels came out. One day, it fell on floor and all parts are separated. In Consumer Review magazine, this was rated very high. After this experience, I stopped reading Consumer Review magazine."
5,Nice Heat,The unit puts out a good deal of heat even on the low setting. The real test will be when I get my first electrical bill.
3,oil smell,"i could've gotten a cheaper one at the 99cent store, but thought i'd get this because it had a thermostat. but like some other reviews, there is DEFINITELY the smell of oil. i thought maybe it just needed to ""burn off"" or something, so i've let it heat up for a few days, but the oil smell persists. yuck."
4,It works.,"We bought this to put at the base of the ill-conceived floor-to-ceiling windows of our rental apartment and it works well. The only con is that the unit switches from 750W to 1500W automatically (in other words you cannot control this setting) which can blow the fuse if another such unit is operated on the same circuit, which we need at the other window of our not-so-great ""great room."""
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!!!,"As far as recieveing this product and quility, 5 stars! But, if you are a real chopped and screw listner, this is HORRIBLE! 007 should not ever chopp and screw anything! I should have known better when I heard how he SLOPPED and chopped up UGK greatest hits!"
2,Mediocre at best,"I was disapointed with this album. I bought it based on some reviews saying it was somewhat mellow, relxing etc.While there were a few nice cuts on the album, most of it was rather incoherent. Parts reminded me of Astral Trip. It certainly wasn't melodic or flowing.I don't think Kitaro has put out a really SUPERB studio album since Ki. Pity."
4,Pleased!,"I am very pleased with this poacher. Primarily because the poaching cups are metal! Others have plastic cups, which raters have disliked. A quick spray of Pam and clean up is a breeze. In addition, the actual pan is small in size, great for storage and other cooking uses. One last thought, each cup holds exactly one large or medium egg--no more."
4,Good as always!,I always love kd lang's albums and this is no exception! I have been listening constantly since I bought it. I can't imagine getting itred of this one. Very upbeat!
4,Finally! It's the great k d lang record!,"Many lang fans have been waiting for this breathtaking vocalist to get it together on disc fully and completely, and ""Invincible Summer"" is that disc. Rather than making another record that is spotty in its brilliance, lang has hit her stride and is now truly invincible. Her latest effort is full of the sound of summer, without resorting to cliche. The songs, mostly co-written by lang, are strong in both lyric and melody, and are varied in tone, making for a very comfortable listen.lang's talent has never been in question, but in terms of artistic direction, quality of content and production values, she has come a long way, baby and made what is by far her best record yet."
4,A New Light on k.d. lang,"k.d. lang comes back with renewed energy. Her long awaited new album is great. I really enjoyed ""summerfling."" Her voice is filled with conviction,energy, and passion. If you enjoyed her previous albums, you like this one as well."
5,Quite pleasing.,"I have to say that I'm much enamored with kd lang's 'Invincible Summer' album. When I first listened, I have to admit, I didn't know what to think... it needed to grow on me. It's a very 'lazy summer day' type of album, very relaxing. Her voice, beautiful as always, is often wrapped in layers of harmony. Lyrics are both fun & lighthearted, but are at times serious and pensive as well. Very pretty. I recommend to both longtime fans and those curious about kd's sound."
1,Disappointed fan,"lang's new CD, Invincible Summer, may likely be my most disappointing CD purchase in a long while. Her newest release has none of the lush quality and surprisingly little depth of some of her previous popular CD's. Unfortunately, this comes off as a rather so-so crossover to pop. Get back on the ballad track and rich music and lyrics we have come to expect and love!"
4,k.d. back to Ingenue form,"k.d. lang has undoubtedly one of the great pop voices of all time, on par with both Patsy Cline and her own late duet partner, Roy Orbison. On Invincible Summer, she rebounds from her last disappointing effort of cover tunes, Drag, to the form she displayed on her peerless early Nineties release, Ingenue (with some of the lighthearted spirit from the soundtrack to Even Cowgirls Get the Blues). In a world of overblown schmaltz from the Christinas and Jessicas of the music world, her new ballads Love's Great Ocean and Only Love are the best date music for adults in eons. Welcome back-"
2,kd lang minus the edge,"First I'll state that I think kd lang is one of the most gifted song stylists of our time. Her live concert performances (which I have seen in Canada and the U.S.) are great musical events; charming, witty, electrically charged and lots of fun. Some of her earlier cds have been brilliant. However, I feel her musical choices in the last few years have lacked imagination and do not sufficiently stretch her as an artist or make us sit up and ACTIVELY listen. She seems to have lost her edge. It's becoming easy listening. Challenge me kd, as you have in the past! Her thrilling talent is much larger than her current material. I appreciate her mission to sing new music but until she finds better material I'd be thankful for a cd of standards from her...to be able to enjoy the full range of her voice and supreme artistry."
2,Forgettable Summer,"I'm glad kd has the ""invincible summer"" inside of her, because"" depths of winter"" is closer to what I felt after listening to this album... cold. I rushed out to buy this cd after reading a great review which had caused me to expect it to be the record of my summer. I'm a kd fan since the mid 80's and I am really disappointed. It is just so much mediocre musak with too many synth sounds, and vapid sweet lyrics. I have listened to it about 8 times in the last three days, hoping it would grow on me, but I cannot for the life of me remember a single melody or lyric. Compare this to the new Sinead I picked up on the same day, played the same # of times, and spent the last three days humming every waking hour. I'm sorry kd, it's back to listening to your old stuff for me."
2,"Timid, Conservative Surround Mix","It's interesting listening to the different approaches to mixing stereo recordings into surround sound. At this stage of the game, each mix almost serves a different philosophy of how to deal with sound coming from multiple channels. k.d. lang's approach, while the music is mildly interesting, could have benefited from a dramatic, bold surround mix. Instead, it holds back and pulls punches. I love how the WEA releases are playable in three different surround modes, depending on your equipment. But here, the results are timid and conservative. Too bad. This is one example of how a bold surround mix could have literally added a new and interesting dimension to an otherwise borderline effort."
3,Somewhat lackluster,"While I love kd's artistry and pipes, this particular CD just turned me off. Its a bit too kitschy-60's pop. There isn't enough that's new in the arrangements that might draw me in. I loved Drag and All You Can Eat because there was a blend of styles. Invincible Summer isn't even hot. It sounds like kd got lost in the springtime sickly-sweet love, and a lot of passion got lost along the way. There is very little edge here. I hope she mixes it up a bit better on her next musical effort."
2,regretably shallow,"I have deeply enjoyed kd's work, but I find her on going releases increasingly stylized, but empty. I regret that I do not appreciate the quest for perfection in muzak, even whilst there is some amusing kitchery here. I wish kd would pare it back and show a little soul, and a little edge."
4,Not Ingenue..but not the mess we are seeing...,"I am a big fan of k.d. At her best she should be the standard for country singers..not Shania Twain. On this album she again proves she has the voice to conquer any material she wants. But if you want her best album get either ""Ingenue"" or ""Shadowland"""
5,Invinicible k. d.,"This is my first k. d. lang album, buying after a friend recommended it to me. I've thoroughly enjoyed it. I never realized how rich and melodious her voice was, how aching and compelling it is. I do not have the benefit of comparing it to any of her other work, but this album does two things for me: makes for GREAT summer listening, and encourage me to go out and purchase more of her albums, which I think speaks for itself!"
3,Too Narrow,"We loved the slippers, they were very good looking and well made. They also seemed like they would be very comfortable, but they run very narrow! My husband has an average foot, but there was no way these would fit. If you order them go a size up!"
4,nice slippers,Good product but not a good choice for those who are used to the comfort of a sheep skin moccasin. Runs a little narrow at the toe and I assume that is why other buyers recommend a size up when purchasing.
4,Inspiring,"I love this CD - the music is so uplifting (wish the CD player in my car was working so I could listen while in traffic!). The harmonies are beautiful, and...was that a baby's voice?"
5,Here until the End,"At this point, I probably know all the words and music. I keep finding new things in this album. While listening to the beginning of Hold me in Your light O Lord, I began to feel like I was walking into a prison. I thought about the prison music of Fidelio by Beethoven and related it to this piece.Love the whole album."
3,not quite as advertised,"This product has not performed exactly as described. It is supposed to be absorbed into the body quickly, but I have found that this has not been the case with me. Have not tried it on a wound, just with other over-the-counter creams."
4,better than aspercreme,I find that this DMSO plus aloe gel really helps my lower back and knee pain. It is more effective than aspercreme and other over the counter items. It's easy to apply and has hardly any of the garlic odor found in straight DMSO.
3,Some were dried out?,"I use a new set every year in my classroom. This set had some duds that were either dried out some or were short on the liquid inside. Perhaps this set was older than the sets I have previously purchased. If they are not dried out, they work well and the children really love them!"
2,Pastels are too Pale,"I was excited to get a larger box of these markers but was very disappointed that I am unable to use the 5 or 6 additional colors on my charts. My students will not be able to see what I write because the extra markers are so PALE. That does not make sense. They smell great, but too many of them are useless."
1,Don't bother!,"This book is a waste of time and money. Is is full of silly ideas and contains no practical information. If you are planning an elegant wedding (formal, or casual) don't bother with this book. If you are under the age of 25, and have a wedding budget of 50,000 + you might like this book. But if you planning a grown-up wedding, & have a budget, spend your money elsewhere."
5,Williams Sonoma Kids Baking,Great book for kids. My granddaughter loved it for Christmas 2009. Arrived just in time for Christmas and in great condition.
4,Worth the price simply for that pretzel recipe!,"This cookbook is great for kids, and encourages them to work with their parents. The pictures give a good idea of what baker should be doing. However, when we try any recipes from the bread section, their pictures of dough never match ours. The pretzel recipe was to DIE FOR! I think I ate 4 of them. They taste just like the ones sold at the mall! The pizza dough recipe wasn't bad either. The butter milk biscuts turned out light and fluffy. We haven't made all the recipes yet, but so far the only flop we've had was the braided egg bread. I'm the mom here and I was having serious issues with that recipe. We ended up throwing away the dough and if I remember correctly, eating a box of oreos instade. But this book is worth it for that pretzel recipe alone."
5,Great easy recipes,The book has great recipes which are easy to follow and fun to do with the kids.We love it and since we got it we have been baking a lot :-)I highly recommend it.
5,Not just for VB.NET programmers,"I have over 35 books on ASP.NET. If there is ONE BOOK you should get, it is this one. The approach is both unique and authoritative. Although the code examples are in VB.NET, I write only in C# and did not find this to be a handicap. It covers topics not covered in any other ASP.NET books, walking you through both ASP.NET architecture and application implementation details. The architecture discussion is important as it gives you insight into the RIGHT way to accomplish something in ASP.NET.For example, I had a requirement that in classic ASP would have required ""including"" some code on every page and a reference to that code or (more dangerous) writing a C++ ISAPI filter. The architecture discussion wasn't a step by step ""you have this specific problem, here is how to solve it"", even better it gave me the information to solve it myself by creating a request filter in global.aspx.cs (in about 5 minutes!!)."
5,"Tremendous book, both in content and presentation","Of all the books on ASP.NET (and there are way too many IHMO), this is easily the best book I've seen. Fritz has that rare ability to present complex technical content in a clear and understandable fashion. The book takes you deep within the architecture of ASP.NET, explaining both how and why things work as they do. This book should be required reading for all ASP.NET developers."
5,Top of the Tots - Love It!,"I cannot understand all the negative reviews of this video. The songs are catchy and fun, and the educational value is very good (doctors, dentists, eating healthy food, etc). And, Larissa Wright has to be the best and most beautiful Wiggly dancer they have ever had. I only wish she was in all Wiggles videos. They should also let Kristy Talbot (Wags the Dog) perform out of costume more often, and she does on a couple of songs on this video. I highly recommend it regardless of all the negative comments."
2,Disappointment for the Wiggles,"Otherwise known for providing phonenominal entertainment for youngsters in the form of goofy songs with adorable movements that all young-at-hearts can dance along with, this DVD is a sad derivaton. My 20 month-old hated it. Back to Yummy Yummy and The Wiggles Dance Party..."
5,Top of the tots is Top with my tot!!,"My 2 year old son loves the wiggles and loves this DVD. The music is catchy and easy for my son to dance and sing to sing along with. The wiggles are excellent entertainers and relate to young children without seeming to be talking down to them. If you are looking for entertainment for your child that is fun, entertaining and rewarding for them, try the wiggles."
2,Not a toe tapper...,"My daughter has pretty much all of The Wiggle's DVD's that are available and loves to dance and sing to them all except this one, which we both found to be less than exciting. I found the songs to be slow and quite frankly, boring and it appears that my daughter feels the same way. If you love The Wiggle's tv show, then I would highly recommend Toot Toot instead. Classic favorites, upbeat happy tunes, one after another (including Zardo Zap which is our favorite!)"
2,Boring - need more like Yummy Yummy,Our 20 month old son loves the Wiggles. He watches Yummy Yummy again and again. What happened to the focused shots and the dancing kids? We hate those back up dancers - they are terrible and boring. The songs are too complicated and muddled sounding compared to their clear and easy to follow songs on previous CD's. I hope they read this and go back to the original stuff. This CD isn't any good and doesn't even keep his attention. I wish we hadn't bought it.
3,Son not crazy about this Wiggles,"This is the first Wiggles that my son (22 months) has not been interested in watching. Never picks it out to watch and walks away from it if I put it in. I think the songs are far fetched and really 'reaching' on this one...BUT I've never judged the Wiggles as my son and most kids love them no matter what! This one however, just hasn't grabbed his attention (or mine!)"
4,Not a favorite yet,"This might be more appealing for older toddlers. It's more wordy than some others, and my not-very-verbal toddler much prefers the straight-forward Wiggle Time, with its simpler sets and songs."
3,"Started out slow, but sucked me in later","It took me a while to get into this book, and I debated tossing it aside, but my friend convinced me to read a few more chapters, and I'm glad I did. The plot picks up quickly, and after the first fifty pages or so I got pretty engrossed in the storyline."
4,Good...but not Great,"Corie enjoys the priveledge of spending her summers at Castle Auburn with the nobility while spending the rest of the years learning to become a wise woman. This story tells of her awakening to the world's unpleasantries and discovering love.The characters were interesting and the romance enjoyable although predictable. It was nicely wrapped up with feel good ending that made you feel as though the book was worth it. Unfortunately, Sharon Shinn's creation takes place in a world that somehow seems incomplete. Instead of using the creative world, it felt as though aspects were unexplained and had they been fully explored would have created an immensely setting for the simple plot.Overall, this made for an enjoyable if not riveting read that leaves the reader feeling pleased."
3,The Song The Presidente Requests,"I'm looking for the song the President requests, when El asks him if he has a favorite song at the dinner. I've tried to catch it in the movie, La ma something, but no luck. If anyone knows the title it would be appreciated."
2,what song is it?,I just wanted to know what song the mariachi band was playing right before the president requested his song.
3,Retractable Cord Doesn't Work,"Overall, this is a good iron. However, if you are buying this iron for the retractable cord feature like my husband and I did, my suggestion would be to look elsewhere. Right from the start, the cord retracts about 3/4 of the way and then refuses to retract the rest of the way. This leaves you with about 6"" of dangling cord to deal with. While the iron works well, I am definitely disappointed with this flaw."
2,poor condition,book came late and was wrote on and marked all over. I was hoping to sell it back but the condition of the book won't allow it
4,We are the winx,"I was the winx hater, but i've dropped thise ways. Once you startwatching it, it's not that bad. It stars a young fairy named BLoom who was raised on Earth, but discovered she had magical powers, anf meet another fairy named Stella. Stella takes Bloom to a Fairy school called Alfea. She meets other fairies, and meets boys from a boy collage, called Red Fountion. But three power greedy witches are after her powers, which is the legandary Dragon FIre. At the end of the third season, Bloom turns from nice to naughty, and proves she is like a witch"
2,Winx and W.i.t.c.h,"This is really nothing special at all, it is 'winx' after all, a series that is not at all 'good' in anyway to start with. The cartoons of the characters are poor, no artistic talent was put into the creation of this series. The books also feature the same poor art work as well, so again nothing special at all. Also one has to think and 'believe' the creators of 'winx' somewhat copied the whole concept otherwise, the girl 'stella' looks and is alot like 'cornelia' from w.i.t.c.h., and this stella is a poor copy of something that is great, that being the w.i.t.c.h. series,I suggest strongly, against this poor talent stuff, and go with something much better, like w.i.t.c.h.. But saying that, winx is not entierly bad and the DVD was OK."
1,Winx Club?! Yeah right. It should be STINX CLUB!!!!!!!!,"THIS SHOW IS SO DUMB. THAT SHOW IS COPYING W.I.T.C.H! MY TWIN SISTER ACTUALLY WANTED THIS SHOW FOR HER BIRTHDAY. SHE RENTED IT AT HOLLYWOOD VIDEO AND CHANGED HER MIND, BECAUSE IT'S JUST ANOTHER TEENY-BOPPER SHOW STARRING MAGICAL PEOPLE WEARING BARBIE CLOTHES! DON'T BUY THIS."
5,Best episode ever,I liked it because there weren't any pauses when I was watching it. I would recommend it to my friends.
5,Good find,"My daughter loves the winx, bought 3 seasons altogether, she has enjoyed endless hours of entertainment in her kindle fire."
5,My daughter favorite show,"This dvd is basically about a fairy name Bloom, who was raised on earth and then found out , she is a fairy. So Bloom leaves her earth family and travel to another world to sturdy magic. In that world she makes new friends with other fairys like Stella, Flora, Musa, Aisha and Techna. She also meets mean witches Icy, Stormy and Darcy who trys to use their power against her and the Fountain boys who are studying about heroics and bravery. Bloom holds the most power in the fairy world and she just don't know about it, but the three witches knows and will try to extract it from her. I bought this dvd for my six year old daughter, she watches it's over and over. There is 15 episodes on the disc so get it."
4,Great video for the kids,My Daughter loves this series. I am a little upset the way they put these together. Only a few episodes per DVD/Box set/ And for the price. Oh well it makes it her happy so be it.
5,Canon review,"I purchased the canon fax machine because of the brand name, it is known for its good quality. It was fairly easy to set up. I found it to be bigger than what I wanted, but it the bigger one was the more efficient one of the two I had to choose from."
2,Jam-O-Matic,"Notwithstanding attractive reviews elsewhere, our office experiencewith the Canon FaxPhone L170 is that incoming faxes cause themachine to jam. If we were doing it again, we'd elect another brand."
5,Nicole roxs my soxs!!,"I just bought this CD and I love it!! I am inpressed my Nicole's power, funky voice! it is encouraging, inspiring music and I highly recommend this to girls of all ages!!"
3,GOOD INFO - JUST NOT ENOUGH OF IT!,"While this book has some nice concepts and illustrations on how to plan your garden floor, and offers a variety of materials to complete the task, I found the book simply did not provide enough detail or information. ""Making Garden Floors"" will make a nice complement to other existing books in your library, but you likely will not find enough information here to use as a ""stand alone book."" There are only 144 pages to this book, so it truly is condensed. However, what information that was provided was worth reading. Other books I do suggest for garden planning which have some excellent coloured photography and creative suggestions are, ""The Complete Gardening Guide"" by Peter McHoy (any material by McHoy is helpful in garden planning) and ""Garden Structures"" by Linda Joan Smith, which contains information on pathways, fences, walls and other structures."
1,THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN,I HATED THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE ABOUT DANCING NOT IN MY TIME BUT TODAY'S TIME IT WAS HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE I HOPE WHO EVER MADE THIS MOVIE GIVE UP ON DIRECTING.
3,Unfortunately the best one I've seen,"I just passed the tests but the book was only partial help. For passing exam 511 it was helpfull, for 512 not so much. There are a lot of phrases, paragraphs etc that appear to be cut and pasted through out the book. If you ever wanted to understand readers' fields this is the book...it also lacks in the requirement of knowledge for Javascript, Java, LotusScript, COM, OLE and LS:DO subjects."
2,Sources please.,"This book is somewhat interesting as a story, has virtually no documented sources whatsoever. There is no bibliography, no works cited, not even footnotes. The closest we get is an occasional quotation from a primary source with a rough citation above or below it. This makes it virtually useless as any sort of serious academic study."
2,Here they go...,"This is a compendium of excerpts reprinted from contemporary sources - mostly just four of them, plus a bevvy of unnamed ones. The author supplies tie-in text that does not get us any further, and is often written in strange language (""...Rome had declined... into a broken ant heap of faction and sedition...""). And there are spelling mistakes that careful proofreading should have avoided."
1,Pile of sh*t,"That's all this band is. I wouldn't recommend this album to a dead man. If you own this CD, I will come to your home, burn it down, smoke all of your family's ashes to get a buzz, then piss on the rest."
4,Great idea!,"We're currently in the process of potty training our 2 yr old daughter, and we travel a bit. I saw this and thought it a great idea! Only problem is, if the seat isn't EXACTLY on right, it can slide off of some hotel toilets. Doesn't work to well on the extra large (oblong) toilets because the back part isn't supported by the normal toilet seat, but it does help. And you do know its clean and you know where its been, so when lil one puts her hands on it to help support herself, you don't have to worry about what shes acutally picking up. Travels well in a diaper bag, purse, or the back of a stroller."
1,Dangerous!!,"I would not recommend this product to anyone!! When I bought this potty seat I thought it was a great idea! I was really excited, it fit perfectly in my purse so I thought that I wouldn't have to worry about public restrooms anymore! But then I got it home, it is made out of really hard plastic and there are no locking mechanisms to keep it unfolded. We have an elongated toilet like most public places so the seat doesn't really fit, when you go to sit your child on it it starts folding up. Either making it fall in the toilet or pinching your childs skin!( It did mine!!) Maybe on a round toilet it will work great but how many public toilet seats are round? Not many!! I think that this was a great idea but this product was not thought through very well! I have had many Graco products & loved them but I feel that this is very dangerous and needs to be remade to be safer and to fit on all toilet seats properly!! I would not buy it!!"
1,Dangerous,"I used this potty for about a month with no problems at all. Last night the potty caved in and my 21 month old daughter fell in the toilet! I would not recommend this product to anyone. She is only 26 pounds and she fell in, what would happen to a larger child? This potty does not come with any warning regarding elongated toilets, since it does not fit on them, you should be careful using it on one."
2,Heavy duty and non stick but will burn cookies,I still have the sticker that came on these 2 pans I purchased and nowhere does it say to turn temp back 25 degrees. Thanks for burnt snickerdoodles .
5,Hardwiring Excellence,"Quint captures the passion of our work in healthcare very effectively. HE is a easy to follow step by step read on how to transform an organization into a high performing ""culture."" The use of story telling keeps you engaged and the principles/tactics are excellent.The book helps to recommit to purpose and worthwhile work. Thank you Quint!"
5,Hardwiring Excellence,I highly recommend this book to any organization who is trying to create a positive service excellence experience for people and patients in the hospital. Service excellence programs come and go but hard wiring excellence is here to stay. This book provides practical advice and examples of how to change behaviors in an organization which impacts service excellence.
5,"A ""must read"" for every healthcare leader","Several years ago, I was privileged to work with a COO who provided this book to all leaders as a textbook for change. And indeed the hospital did change as we focused on the Five Pillars (People, Service, Finance, Quality, Growth). We saw huge gains in employee satisfaction as we became more intentional in our interactions with staff. We enlisted staff-based teams to rebuild our culture around service. What a joy to belong to an organization that had aligned itself with its mission! I was blessed to be able to carry many of the things I learned to my next leadership opportunity where, again, a dramatic move toward increased employee satisfaction and service excellence changed the flavor and function of the organization. Find this book now! Get another copy for a forward thinking leader in your organization, maybe even your boss! Excellence doesn't just happen. It's a plan and a choice."
2,over board,"I liked the mystery, I even liked the whole family dynamic with the mom and absentee brother. however! holy smokes. I sat there through this book rolling my eyes or skimming the preachy bits. I am Christian, but this was a bit overboard for my liking. I keep wondering why i finished it.. probably to see ""who done it."""
3,Neoprene Free Weights,The actual weights are as expected; however one of the top selling points for me was the storage case to enable portability & clean efficient storage. When the shipping box arrived it seemed too big for such a small item and did not properly secure the contents. With that said the internal black storage box for the weights was cracked & broken which doesn't close. Quite useless. Reading prior reviews stating the same issue it begs the question if the reviews and comments are taken in to consideration by the supplier. Obviously they need to either not ship damaged product OR package it better so it's not damaged during shipping. Difficult to determine the actual factor
2,Great...when it works...,Works sometimes and others it doesn't. It's hit or miss.Looks cute and has a decent picture.
3,Not too bad,"This is not LP's best outing, but not the worst. Compared to its competitors, it was better if you are interested in visiting the eastern part of the main island (fajardo, etc.). The culebra and san juan parts are also excellent. Could use a little more of everything, though - feels thin at times."
1,Not One of Lonely Planet's Best,I usually like Lonely Planet titles. This book is a letdown over books in the series. The writers of the 4th Edition (published 2008) do not seem to enjoy their subject matter very much and this comes across in their lukewarm reviews of the island and its culture. Skip this edition and check LET'S GO or FODOR'S - both do a much better job and with loads more enthusiasm.
2,THE STEPFATHER! THE LIFETIME CHANNEL VERSION!,"Having always been a fan of the original film, I was curious to see this remake, even though I expected the worst. While this is an OK watch for thriller fans, it is inferior to the original in every way. In fact the original is more intense, more graphic and just more fun! This film looked and felt like a Lifetime TV movie especially with Ward playing the new wife in this tame and pointless remake.If you looking to watch a film about a psychotic Stepfather, skip the watered down remake and look for the original, which has finally gotten a long over due DVD release this past year, no doubt because of the remake, so I guess the remake did serve a purpose after all."
1,A Master Class In How To Make A Horrible Film,"So you say you wanna be a schlocky filmmaker? Step right this way...1. Choose a lead who is woefully miscast (and if he's thoroughly outclassed by the originator of the role? Even better!).2. Waste good actresses who shouldn't be reduced to this kind of dreck just because they're over 35 (Sela Ward and Paige Turco).3. Make sure your teen leads are at least 28.4. Thoroughly ignore what made the original film you're remaking memorable in the first place.5. Tailor the environment of your characters and your plot to keep the teenage girl in her bikini.6. Craft your suspense for audiences who have never ever ever seen any other movie.7. Then leave the door open for that sequel, baby!"
2,Low Budget Affair,"A formulaic film, that looks like it was produced on a shoe string, and where we know exactly the road it will follow. Therefore, there is little or no suspense beyond the general startle by slasher set-up. The use of a hand held jumpy camera for the slasher parts is vertigo-inducing, and several of the other scenes are dimly lit (i.e. in a dark basement where it's difficult to see.) Did not enjoy this one at all, although the ""bloopers"" in the special features segment were pretty funny."
3,An OK movie,"It's a pretty decent movie, nothing over the top. I thought it is somewhat predictable. One of my favorite scenes lasts for only a couple seconds. At about 1:08 into the movie, there is a nice close-up of the young lady's rear end in a bikini, which I enjoy quite much. Other than that, nothing else to write home about."
5,Good remake with a solid cast.,"I know that this remake gets a lot of hate, I actually enjoyed it. Fun performances and a slick pace. It's not as good as the first 3 Stepfather films, but still worth checking out."
1,trash,Please give me my two hours back -- so predictable and annoying (how many times can people make the same stupid movie???)
3,KILLIN DYLAN,Was a remake of the 1987 cult classic really necessary? Not really. Is Dylan Walsh better than Terry O'Quinn? Not really. Is this a bad movie? Not really. Walsh is a good actor and can be quite creepy as the psycho dad from hell. Sela Ward and Jon Tenney are as always strong in support. I wasn't impressed with Penn Badgely..obvious eye candy for the teen audience. I found myself caught up in its predictable plot so it's not all that bad.
3,Pleasant read.,"This book is a pleasant read, and fun at times, but itjust never measures up to the usual Bernhardt standardof excitement and fast-paced action.The characters don't ring quite as true as in his priorworks, so it is difficult to get involved with them andthis mystery.I look forward to his next entries in the mystery category."
1,No stars for this book!,"This is my second attempt to review this book. The first was too critical of the author to publish the review, or so they advised me. Let's start with what this book is not. It is not an attempt by the author to be funny. It is not a novel which displays the least understanding of the Master's golf tournament. It is not a novel which displays the least understanding of the game of golf - it's rules - it's nomenclature or it's history. It is - in short - the worst novel by a successful author that I have ever read and I have enjoyed Mr. Bernhardt's other efforts. It deserves no stars. It should be avoided at all costs. Fair warning!"
1,Golf novel at it's worst,"Terrible! To call this book terrible is an insult to all bad golf novels ever written. The author has no clue about his subject what-so-ever. How the publisher let this tripe get by is beyond me. The book lost me when the author mentioned ""watertraps"" and ""pros' wearing shorts"" at Augusta National. Silly putty golf ball centers, please. Anyone who has ever spent any time around golf knows that golf ball centers are made from Chinese herbs and goat eyes.I have read hundreds of golf books over the years, and this book ranks last by a long shot. Do not waste your time and energy on this poor excuse for a golf novel."
2,A hit and miss album,"I bought this album used online for like $2 and that's what I would say it's worth. I never would have paid full price for this so-so album with only 7 songs on it. There's a few good songs on it - Flippin' Out and Wild Animal are sexy, Samuelle is a haunting sounding slow song, and Strap On Robbie Baby is my personal favorite because of the 80's rock guitar. The other songs however are very poor: Mechanical Emotion is a mechanical bore, Crazy Maybe is stupid, and the lead single Pretty Mess is plain - I have no idea why that was a single.One thing all the songs have in common though are that all of the lyrics are bizarre and make no sense, but of course, Vanity probably wrote all of the songs while high on drugs (she admitted during her whole career she was on cocaine heavily).Overall, it's a forgettable 80's album but it might be worth purchasing for a laugh as long as you don't pay much for it."
4,Excellent start off,"This book is an excellent book to start of with, other than just folk and classic, it should have jazz, and you definately need a tutor or more experienced player, to mark the exact points for where the notes are, then the book is the best thing to start of with, I learnt my first song, myself thanks to this book."
2,I've read a lot better.,"I am a special forces enthusiast and I admit that i have read almost every book out there on the subject. Never fight fair is essentially a compilation of old war stories that often sound unbelievable and straight out of movies. If you like to hear old ""core lore"" and enjoy the simple-minded, entertaining novel then read this but if you are a military enthusiast like myself then try to steer clear of this one."
3,This was a little rushed....,"As I was reading this book, I got the feeling that this was going to be another 5 book series. It sure feels like it when you get 3/4 of the way through the third book and nothing is really resolved. Boy does that ""ending"" sure sneak up [...]!!! I swear she wrote this book, got half way done, and was told she had to end the series with this book. The ending is that contrived. I loved her first 5 books and found them to be innovative and interesting, and I really enjoyed her first 2 books of this series (I was looking forward to this book for over a year), and feel that there was so much more that could have been done. Damn, I finished the book just 5 minutes ago and it's like ash in my mouth. She better write some more to finish this off correctly (she didn't even get into the original 4 and why 5 were needed to stop them [...]. It had a good deep feeling, but lost it in the end."
1,Disappointing Finish,"I would have to agree with some of the other reviews. The original series is worth reading, but do yourself a favor and skip the Enthroned. The quality of the writing declined between the first and second series, and I am guessing that her publisher was disappointed in sales for enthroned and told her to wrap it up when she was half way through book three, leaving the ending rushed, disappointing and unbelievable."
5,"This Book is a ""Must Have"" for All Halloween Collectors!!","Mark B. Ledenbach's new book ""Vintage Halloween Collectibles""is an exhaustively comprehensive reference guide for all collectors of Halloween. It is also a valuable resource for dealers who would like a better understanding of value and rarity for their own selling standards. Inside you will find an extensive catalog of vintage Halloween items beautifully photographed with each item carefully identified by maker, country of origin, year made, dimensions, level of rarity and current value. The book covers a huge range of decorations, noise makers, diecuts, candy containers, nodders, figurals, lanterns and shades, games and more! If you've been a long time collector of Halloween or are just beginning, you will find this book an invaluable tool--not to mention it's just plain fun to browse through!"
4,Great Halloween Images,"I am just starting to become familiar with Halloween collectibles. This book is a wonderful addition to anyone's Halloween library, whether you are a vintage collector or just delight in the holiday and all things Halloween. It provides a lovely visual guide of novelties from Halloweens past. It was neat to look through and see how many antique and vintage Halloween items have now spawned modern reproductions and have inspired the decorative items that are in the marketplace today."
4,Very large & beautiful covered casserole!,"This Sango Splash 2 1/2 quart covered casserole is a real beauty. It's larger than I expected also. It will make a lovely serving dish as well.I deducted one star because the lid does not fit tightly on the dish. Also, the lid does stick up quite high, which in my opinion is unnecessary. This feature will require that I remove one of the ovens racks and place this covered casserole on a low rack.But the loose-fitting lid is bothersome. I would have liked the lid to fit more snugly. However, I am happy with my purchase and can't wait to use the dish!"
3,Is it really a help?,"When I ordered the book, I was expecting that it would delineate, amplify and develop the content of the ""philosophy"" of Agrippa. Well, I didn't get this impression, since the book is the sum of isolated comments of a gifted scholar in occultism.It does not mean that the Commentaries have little value, but it is not the type of document which leads to a better understanding of the Agrippa philosophy. The bibliography is also outdated.On the other hand, if you are interested in the occultism in general and its history, it is interesting to get it."
5,historical guitar,"I love guitar music, especially historical. This is a beautiful cd. I listen to it quite often."
2,Didn't work for me,"Besides being big and ugly, this antenna did no better than a cheap pair of rabbit ears. I returned it and got the Philips MANT410 which works at my house perfectly."
3,Does the job but not very high quality,"The product itself is quite solid and good design. But I can only receive a couple of channels with good quality and those channel each require different adjustments to get the quality.For the price I think it is decent, but don't expect crystal clear pictures unless you are located close to the towers."
2,"HDTV Powered Antenna, works like unpowered","I had an old 75 ohm '? adapter that has 2 screws for wires (antennas) and 1 coax to hook to the TV. It works better than this HDTV Powered Antenna. Seriously, I can unplug the power and there isn't a noticable difference. You'd almost be better off sticking an unbent paperclip in your coax jack and call it good (Yes that works if you're TV isn't against a metal wall).Wm"
2,Not impressed,I am not impressed. I am not picking up any of HDTV channels with this antenna. The UHF and VHF channels are coming in a little bit clearer but that is about it.
2,confusing,it works better if it is unpluged..i got a set of rabbit ears from a friend which has vhf on them..and it works better than this unit..i am about 50 miles from tv stations
4,Saucin' in Ireland,"Martini Jive is definitely worth a listen, but seeing these guys live is like nothing else. Get ready for lots of pints and (believe it or not) hot and steamy nights on the Emerald Isle.If you want to check them out, they will be playing all over county Cork and England during 10/2000. Check them out if you can! If your interested in tour information, e-mail andyandcasey@yahoo.com!"
2,Flat and Limp Voice,"I Like About 3 or 4 songs on here. I hate to sound negative but what i do not like about this cd is that, Jo'Omeara sounds very pitchy in most of the songs...Her voice starts to sound flat and very monotone after 1 or 2 songs. She Does'nt have much range. She Just raises her voice. Her voice sounds shakey and unstable. especially on ""Relentless"" the very first track. I love the song,i really do but her voice sounds like any minute shes gonna break down and cry. I am not a great singer myself but,Jo Omeara needs some voice lessons. Her voice is very drab and boring. It's Nothing extra.For some reason she sounded so much better with S Club 7...you know what,the songs on the album are great,if Kelly Clarkson or Jessica Simpson sang them. I listen to the songs and just imagine ""what if...""...it gets me through the songs i like."
2,Look for a download for the one good song,"I'd been listening to the Zombies box set ZOMBIE HEAVEN and mythologizing all the musicians that passed in the night. I remembered just loving ""I Don't Believe in Miracles"" and thought that since Russ Ballard wrote the darn thing, it would be worth resurrecting for my Ipod. Well that track is as good as pop hits that never really hit gets, but the rest of the cd is just pure pop bilge. Find a place to download the one good song. Yes, you'll think there's probably something else on this cd that is just as good, but there isn't. Ballard was just a one shoulda been a hit wonder."
4,I like It,I like it. It is very bright. It makes a big difference when I am shooting an event.I don't have much to add. It is a light bulb.
2,got it as a gift,"the ring its self is nice.but the thing that confuses is me is why these rings are sized 10 or 9 or lower. i got the biggest size to be safe (9 i think), and the stupid ring looked like it could barley fit a 5 year old. its as if they expect you to have skeleton sized fingers.theres no way the ring was a size nine if so then a size fize according to this ring is the radius of a pencil"
4,useful,Very useful book when prepping for lsat. Definitely helps not only with practice but also on how to improve what you are doing wrong. Book arrived in the exact condition that was stated in description and on time.
4,This book is all right.,"I think that this book is all right. Maybe I am being unfair considering how boring the subject matter is, but it is hard to read this book for more than half an hour at a time. There are three sample tests in the book with an explanation to the answer that you should have gotten, which is really helpful. I like to read the beginning section on test strategy, and learn about the specific methods to answer each different style of questions. I will probably buy another book from another company because that was recommended by a LSAT prep site somewhere, but this book would be the only one if I was only planning on buying one."
1,Not Received,There was a problem with the delivery.But the owner of the product was very cooperated and he refund my money.
2,Interesting Drama Gets Lost In A Poorly Written Book,"This book was a disappointment. The typos and cliches are a distraction to the fruitfull adventures of Mr. Thomas McShane. It's too bad, really."
5,Very very entertaining..,"The stories contained in this book tell us the Author McShane has led an extraordinary life. Its a truly entertaining read, and for a first timeauthor like McShane although some minor grammatical imperfections pop-up these can be easily excused, once one learns the details of these art heists and how he helped the FBI get to the bottom of them. In fact I found it hard to put this book down..probably most entertaining read I've picked up in the last 2 years."
4,Nice pack of toys!,"I was looking at the Melissa and Doug sets before I saw this gem. The M&D sets, while I'm sure they are high quality, were the same price for three toys or so. This is a great value for the price. Your kid would probably break or lose the expensive set just as easily, and in this set he gets the same stuff ... and more weird little sandcastle-forming blocks. My toddler likes playing with the pieces wherever -- in the sand, in the pool, in the bath, or just on the floor. He especially enjoys the little car that is included. A win. A must have for the summer months! I also love that the set comes with little gardening tools so he can help me garden without impaling himself on my spade. Hooray!"
5,quite possibly the perfect pen,"This is nearly the perfect pen, with the only drawback being that it is slightly lighter than the older version of the Rotring Multipen. It makes a great impression on anyone you hand it to, just make sure to get it back!"
3,Audio 10 - Video 2 1/2 - # of Tracks 0,First of all this is Paul Simon (without Art) at his very best. This was one of his best concert tours ever; with the best band backing him. The Audio on this DVD is a 10.Now to the other two areas. The Video shot in 1980 is not up to standards. I've seen less grainy prints from decades earlier. Now my biggesr beef. I paid $32.95 + tax Canadian for this DVD. Yes I knew how many tracks were on it when I bought it. However; after watching it and remembering the original concert tour (Toronto Stop) I know there were many more songs performed than 11. No one twisted my arm; but to get those musicians and Simon together was a must. I will cherish it; but boo to whomever put it together. Maybe there was nothing they could do about the video on this one performance; but they could have given us the WHOLE SHOW! I have to leave on a positive note. The playing and the 5.1 sound is fabulous!
3,typos...,"When I spend money on an item, I expect that item to be worth the money I paid for it. While I loved the story, and read it in one sitting, the typos were distracting at best and downright annoying at worst.Someone else pointed out the use of ""Skif"" and ""Skiff"" In addition there was ""agrin"" instead of ""again"", ""to"" instead of ""two."" Exclamation points instead of the letter ""l"" (As in the word well was spelled ""we!!"")It's worth the read, just don't spend money on it..."
5,LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!,I stayed up until 6:27 in the morning reading it. It's great!!! Before I read it I hadn't really read a good book!!!
1,Doesn't do 90 watts on an Inspiron 8200,"I got this power supply on an emergency basis to replacde my missing Dell Inspiron 8200. Inspiron 8200's require a 90w power supply. I picked this one over others beacuse it explicitly said that it suppoerted the 8200. While my 8200 will charge the battery from it, it will NOT run at 90w power, only 75w and it gives me a boot up warning that the power supply is inadequate. Back to the store..."
1,Good for 2-3 year olds,"I bought this when my daughter was 3. She's nearly 6 now nad hasn't touched it in a more than a year- She doesn't want me to donate it though- so... ? I had just gotten my own indoor excercise bike and thought it may be fun to do together while watching tv or something. No problem receiving it in mail or assembling, but the size is much too small and the option to increase tension in pedals for easy/hard pedalling does not really work. The pedals don't glide easily and it is really more of a novelty item. Additionally, rasing the seat level does not help as the seat slowly slides back to the low position. If it were $20. I wouldn't think twice, but for the money, NOT WORTH it."
1,Not what we wanted,"Looking for a can opener to match the Oster Metalic red - this looked like it the picture, but when it arrived, it is a plastic red and doesn't match the rest of the Oster line."
2,Disappointed,"I disregarded the other bad reviews of this item thinking other recipients may have been in a bad mood, unfortunately I have to agree with the other *not so great* reviews of this item. Although this is a Wilton product and seems to be of good quality, I was disappointed when using this spring form pan for the first time, the small carter pin that holds the latching clip fell out when I closed the pan. I tried to re-attach it and it still fell out. Amazon's online return process was very helpful in setting up the parcel pick up and I do not hold Amazon responsible for the defect of this product. As with any online purchase, you sometimes receive a bad apple and in this case I did. I appreciate the great deal of merchandise Amazon carries and will continue to be a loyal customer."
2,"Softly, Softly","I looked forward to this book with great anticipation, having just become a Sean Bean fan via a re-broadcast of the Sharpe series here in Canada. I was therefore majorly disappointed when I finally received it, and, started to read that what we have here is a major schmooze fest, your basic typical celebrity bio in which people say nice things about the star in question, &, that's about all. There is no nitty gritty, no digging to find out what really makes Sean Bean tick. He's gone through 3 marriages & it's all dealt with in less than 10 pages. On the up side there are some interesting quotes from co-stars, & colleagues. There are some interesting descriptions about how some projects got made, particularily Sharpe. Mostly, though, it's style without substance."
2,not for sale,I read this book because I ordered it from an inter library loan. It is not for sale through Amazon much to my disappointment. The book is a good overview of Mr.Bean's work in films. It does not offer anything else.
1,Major Desifn Flaws,"I have had to replace the power supply for the drive 5 times, Lacie refuses to cover the burn out power supplies after the one year warranty on the drive it self is over."
3,Telephone,"Nice looking machine with lots of options. Reception on phone itself is weak and inconsistent even with the 32 different channels you're allowed to connect with. Good reception with the hands-free option, yet the people you're talking to can't hear you."
4,Great product for the price,This worked better than I expected it too. For the price of 10$ dollar you can't expect a phone better than this. It generates little static when you go far from the base but overall a great cordless phone with answering machine.
1,"[Uh oh, looks like trouble...]","I loved the format of the book and the way it integrated with the application. Even the way it integrates with the Lotus Exam Guide (WORD TO WORD!!). Bonus! you might think since everything that is in the book is clear and precise and right (except the answer to question 33 in the 520 test). BUT!!The surprise comes with the real exam. Out of 40 questions, I can honestly say that for 10 of them I had NO Idea what they were talking about(they were NOT covered in the book) and 15 were WEB oriented (which is barely covered in the book). The format of the demo exam is NOT anywhere near what you will have to face at the real test.My suggestion, Get 4 computers, this book and the whole bunch of Lotus Redbook, build your own network and make SURE you know what is the minimum permission for EVERYTHING!"
2,Don't Even Think About this Book for Exam 522,"In all of the exams I have taken (520, 521, 522, the three R4 CLP exams and 6 MCSE exams, 522 is the only one I did not pass the first time out. It is also the only time I decided to use one study source -- this book. That's on me, but the fact is that this book doesn't come close to preparing you for the 522 exam. After reading this book thoroughly and only missing two question in the practice exam, I was asked questions on the real exam that I never imagined would be asked. Again, that's my fault, but don't rely on this book."
2,Doesn't last long.,"After washing our car and our truck twice each (a total of 4 car-washes, so 16 individual tire applications), my bottle is empty. Had to put it on really thick to even notice a difference between dry and ""wet"" tires. I will not be buying this again."
1,They won't stay put!,"I followed the directions and I did remove my old insoles first. I cut them to fit, and they fit exactly to the form of the shoe until I stick my foot in! There is no glue to hold these things in place! As soon as I put my foot in they try to curl under the ball of my foot, like you would do if you folded your bed pillow under to make it higher. I tried holding it in place with my finger while slipping my foot in with so so results. In any case even if I got them to stay in place for a little while the came out along with my foot every time I took the shoes off! They should come with some sort of peel off backing with glue underneath like pre-glued floor tiles or something to hold them in place. as is they are useless for me!"
4,Anything is better than a plain steel toe boot!,"The instructions, which I didn't read, tell you to throw out the existing insoles in your shoes. I didn't do that and these sucked for about a week as they slid around and were uncomfortable. Then I read the instructions and rectified this mistake. I guess RTFM applies to gel inserts too...Now they are very comfortable. They could be better, but I am happy with them. I gave the other pair to my father-in-law and he loves them too."
1,Broken out the box,"This took out the package, plugged it in, and got nothing. The power light would not come on. The connection going into the unit seemed to be flimsy. After wiggling the wire around, I got some static on the screen. Finally I got the power to stay on, and tried playing a DVD. It played a few minutes and then froze up. Repeated this 3 times, put it back in the package, and mailed back to Amazon."
2,Freezes on startup,"Right out of the box, this thing doesn't work properly. When I insert a DVD, it sometimes freezes, and can't load the DVD. It usually gets stuck as it's trying to load the main menu of a DVD. I haven't noticed it freezing during actual playback.I've only had this for a few days, so maybe things will get better - but right out of the box, it should at least work, and it doesn't.Be cautious with this - even though it's currently $80, it may not be worth it."
2,Not Happy,"Overall the its an OK player, but what turned it from a 5 star rating to a 2 is product detail by Amazon. I looked high and low for weeks for a 7"" screen dvd player with hi-resolution which Amazon's descriptions claims this to be. Under the specification it says the screen is a 720x480 but when I got my player and measured it out, it was only 480x234 at best. Now I know some retailers would describe a 480x234 as 1440x234 to make it look better than it really is, but I purchased this from Amazon thinking they of all people would have the right specs. Lesson learned, can't trust anyone's specs."
3,Great Little Player,I really liked this little player. It broke very easily though. That's my only complaint. Great picture.
5,Beautiful as it is functional,"The photo does not really do this pan justice. Wilton has been a leader in cake equipment for as long as I can remember. I bought this pan originally because it was listed as being 2 1//2 inches deep (it's not -it's 2 - I was looking for a lasagna pan.) I was so intrigued with the quality that I decided to keep the pan. It's a sturdy metal with a sleek, non-stick coating on all surfaces. If a pan can be attractive, Wilton did it! The lid fits pretty well - the sides slid over the handles to lock it in place. I baked a cake in it and it's the best non-stick I have ever used. I have an AirBake pan that used to be my favorite - I think this pan will be taking it's place!"
3,Atmospheric Horror From Down Under,"You know that if you're watching a horror film and young people set out on a road trip they're not going to wind up at Disneyland so the actual story of Wolf Creek has no surprises.2 girls and a guy set out for fun until they encounter Crocodile Dundee's evil twin.The setup is predictable but this Australien film makes great use of the desolate and often beautiful landscape and features intense natural style acting.Even before the killing starts the film sets an unsettling mood and the film differs from Hollywood films by not offering a comfortably pat ending.Moody,well crafted and merciless not a good ""popcorn flick"" but good for horror fans."
4,Great Film,I have to say that this film surprised me in that it was a great independent film. But then again most good horror films have been coming from independent film makers and not Hollywood. Yes the film did start off slow and it was sometimes hard to understand their accents but impressive non the less. I love the gritteness of this movie and they didn't skimp out on the gore like Hostel! Must have for any horror collection and the fact that this is a true story makes it that much better. Wait till you see the ending. I loved this film!
1,piece of junk,"this movie is horrible, absolutely stupid. this is not worth the $3 i paid to rent it. i was pissed i paid that much to see it. the whole time i was like how much time is left, come on. this movie is retarded, it is stupid, it is not scary. DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS MOVIE!!!!!!"
4,Now thats a Knife!,"I really enjoyed this independent Aussie horror flick! Yeah, it has a plot along the lines of TCM and the like, but it was so well made, acted, and directed that it all felt fresh again. I understand people feeling that the first act takes too long to get moving, but when it does-Look OUT!I saw both the theatrical and unrated dvd version, and I think the DVD version has an extra 10 minutes of character development and maybe a little longer is spent on the violence. So if you want to see it like in the theater, try the rated version(for those of you with ADD). You won't miss anything as far as I could tell..."
2,Way over hyped!,"I was so excited to get ahold of a copy of this to watch it after all of the hype it got. Then I got one, what a let down.I was expecting the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre what I got was a super boring, thoughtless waste of my time. Sterotypical plot, there isn't even much violence in this film. The movie spends more time showing us how the trio got to Wolfcreek then what happened when they actually got there. The movie had alot of promise and could have been so much more, but really didn't live up to it's hype."
3,I think 3 stars is appropriate.....,"I think 3 stars is appropriate for this movie. The acting was good. some of the events are stated to be actual, and i thought it worked better than most of the garbage horror that we have been getting lately. it reminded me of a lot of other movies, but i guess that's the way it is. what else is there left to do? this is worth a rental for horror fans. i have seen a lot worse than this film. anyway, i guy who gets lucky enough to take a road trip with two sheilas, is aces im my book."
3,Realistic,"Based on actual events of two missing British female backpackers, this movie does pull you in, although is rather slow moving for the first half. Wolf Creek was a surprise hit at the Australian Box Office considering horror films have been out of sorts for some time. Wolf Creek works for AUstralian audiences in particular because we are all so familiar with a number of back packer murders in the Australian outback.Wolf Creek has a reasonably eeery atmosphere, and as mentioned above, is more realistic than say another torture film ""Hostel"". ""Hostel"", while effective, is hard to take seriously as what is depicted has never actually happened in the country the film was set in, or anywhere that I have heard of."
5,Very good B horror flick,"I liked this movie, but I am one that loves B horror flicks. I read in an earlier post that this movie is just like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I don't agree with that at all. This movie is way better than the TCM by far. It was based on a true story in Australia about some some ""hikers"" getting trapped at a hiking trail and someone comes along to ""save"" them. Yes, it seems like the story has been told before. If you bear in mind, history does repeat itself and so do crimes even in different countries. I thought that the acting was very good and the story does hold it's ground. Yes, there were holes in the story with the ""victims"", but this is a B horror flick and it doesn't have a very high budget. See this movie and maybe it will be just as enjoyable for you as it was for me. I recommend this one!!!"
1,Crocodile Dundee was scarier ...,"Wasn't this movie originally titled S@*& Creek ? I swear that's the movie I watched. Quentin Tarantino must be smoking better herb than I am, because he recommends this drivel and I can't recommend seeing the trailer."
3,What makes Popcorn Pop?,"I ordered this book for my step daughter. When we went to the beach last summer, the owners had one there. I was a little disappointed that it was not a small hard back book. The one at the beach house was and easy for her to handle. In addition to the size being larger, I feel the smaller version being in a hard back would make for a great way to keep it for years to come."
3,Adult Contemporary Hogwash,"This album is well executed progressive adult contemporary music. It should have been released 10 years ago when this style was more popular. This album sounds dated, and not in a cool ""retro"" way.The Lyrics are too self-conscience, too contrived, too ""I'm writing this for the ages.""The musicians show some great promise. The singing is haunting, especially the female voice (Lyn K).If you like the progressive music movement of 10 and 20 years ago, then this will make you happy. If you want something fresh, look elsewhere.See them live, if you can. The are much better live."
2,Re-hashed stories,"You can read most of these stories in ""Elvis, What Happened?"" That book was written 31 years ago and he is still telling the same stories. Not that I recommend that book, I don't, I don't believe but maybe half of what was in that book. The format is bad. They could have put in more pictures of Elvis while he was telling his stories or a 1 on 1 interview would have been better. Save you money on this one and buy one of Sonny's books, you'll get more info."
2,Very poor,"It may just be me, but I can't understand why the other reviewers have heaped such praise on this lamentable effort.I was aware that the reception this album received was very mixed, but felt I should find out for myself. To summarise, 'I Like Girls' is good, 'Big Boy', 'Everybody's Stupid' and 'Throw Her Away' are passable, the rest is forgettable. The funny thing about this album is that whilst it has a punky feel, like some of the best songs from the preceding 'Holy Trinity' (KMH, Propaganda, Indiscreet), 'Big Beat' just doesn't seem to carry it off as well. Unfortunately, the ever witty lyrics of Ron Mael clash with a tired sound. Sparks may be cool, but they are NOT HARD. Incidentally, 'I Like Girls' and 'Big Boy' (and bonus track 'Gone With the Wind') can be found on the useful 1974-76 compilation 'In The Swing'."
1,Just plain bad,"I like the Prisoner. I can even say that I love it. This is why it hurts me to say that this book is just wrong. It breaks one of the two primary rules of the show. The first rule is that we NEVER learn why Number 6 resigned. The second is that we NEVER learn his real name.This book broke that second rule in more than one place. He described his name as being the British equivilent to ""John Doe"". He was called John by his 'fiancee'. Finally he was called Drake by the Field Marshal. For those unaware, John Drake was another spy character played by Patrick McGoohan and McGoohan made every effort in the production of The Prisoner to never make a direct connection between the two characters. It was always implied, but never stated. For an author to state this is just wrong."
5,Freedom now,Maderna's Electronic Music is a clear sign of what a master can do with advanced technologies and new communication's tools. The rich poetry of his music and his Italian lyricism flow full of freedon and passion. A must for all music lovers.
5,Christmas at the Biltmore Estate,I have really enjoyed the DVD and CD of Judy Collins---Christmas at the Biltmore Estate. I first saw it on PBS a number of years ago and have wanted it since. Very satisfied with this product.
1,Will rust and not leak-proof,"First the pros:Looks nicejust the right size for 2 peopleNon Stick materialThe cons:It leaks (i made cheesecake, which has a thick consistency). The bottom even spins around even when it's clamped in a ""lock"" position.used it EXACTLY one time, it rusted after washing it. In the areas where the metal was folded over to create a lip, red rust appeared after the first wash.When i wiped it with a napkin, the napkin turned red/rusty color. not sure how others would miss pointing this out.I can deal with the ""not leak proof"" aspect of this pan, but unless you like rust in your cake, steer clear of this item.Will be returning it today."
4,Historically Essential,"You must play this loud, when non-appreciative people are out. The main tracks are seriously GREAT, the add-ons from the studio are a bit ordinary but make the collection complete. Three awesome players having musical fun pushing each others' boundaries, wonderful stuff!"
1,Don't waste a penny on this one,"There is a reason this wasn't released in full for almost 30 years. It sucks.Read the liner notes, and even John McLaughlin told the studios not to release it back then, ""over his dead body"". He has since had a ""change of heart"", or maybe it was a change in his pocket book, because this CD should have never been put out.All three of these musicians are my personal favorites at their respective instruments, but this recording is absolutely terrible. Tony Williams' drumming is OK (not his best, not like VSOP Quintet) but was miked so poorly that all you hear is cymbals, so overbearing that they wash out everything else. Jaco, well, you can't even hear him on most of this recording, he is so quiet and also miked so poorly. And McLaughlin has a couple moments of Mahavishnu Orchestra-esque potential that never quite blossoms, the rest dragging and uninspired. My comments are the same for the live tracks as for the studio ones as well."
4,THREE FUSION SUPERSTARS,"HALF OF THIS ALBUM IS FROM A LIVE PERFORMANCE IN HAVANA, CUBA IN 1979, THE REST IS RECORDED SHORTLY AFTER IN THE STUDIO IN NEW YORK CITY. THE TRIO OF JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, TONY WILLIAMS, AND JACO PASTORIUS IS INSPIRING. THREE FANTASTIC MUSICIANS AT THE HEIGHT OF THEIR CREATIVITY, AND A BLEND OF OF THREE OF JAZZ FUSION MUSIC'S FINEST. I RECENTLY READ THAT IT WAS TONY WILLIAMS THAT BROUGHT JOHN MCLAUGHLIN OVER TO MEET MILES DAVIS THE DAY BEFORE THE RECORDING OF BITCHES BREW, AND HE HAD JOHN IN THE STUDIO THE NEXT DAY SITTING IN TO PLAY ON THAT GROUNDBREAKING ALBUM OF FUSION MUSIC, WHICH SET THE DIRECTION OF A LOT OF JAZZ FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS. SADLY, TONY WILLIAMS AND JACO PASTORIUS ARE NO LONGER WITH US, SO THIS RECORDING WAS A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME EVENT."
3,--Disappointing--,"MISS READ'S CHRISTMAS BOOK is a compilation of Bible quotations, poetry, Christmas Carols, diary excerpts and extracts from various Christmas stories.I did find a few of my personal favorites here, along with some writings that I was not familiar with. Christiana Rossetti is represented with two of her beautiful poems. Writings by Thomas Hardy, Dylan Thomas and Charles Dickens are also presented. The illustrations by Tracey Williamson are very attractive.Although the book had diverse readings, I felt that it was a little disjointed. I expected to find a forward from Miss Read, but there wasn't any. I had the feeling that this book was put together in a rather commercial way. I didn't find the satisfaction that I was looking for and, overall, the book was a disappointment for me."
3,Blur in a haze,"This largely hit and miss affair, showcases the band at the height of their American indie rock fixation. Despite a promising opening- with the gorgeous bittersweetness of ""Beetlebum"" and the two minute pogo pop masterpiece ""Song 2""- this album soon falls into a rather incoherent disarray of ""experiments"" as they try to duplicate the sounds of their transatlantic influences a la Sonic Youth and Pavement. The undisciplined use of distortion, and lo fi production values I found frequently annoying and ill conceived. It is amiable never the less, for such a commercial band as Blur to take the risk and reinvent themselves here,albeit only half convincingly. For the ardentfan it's an interesting document of a band in the midst of transformation, but for those of you who prefer listening to a CD that does'nt require you to press the ""skip"" button every other song, I'd advice you to buy ""13"", wherein they completed the transformation to realize an exciting new sound."
2,Burning down the Country House.........,"Blur, obviously embarrassed by their large teenybopper following, sack the brass section, turn up the guitars and go back to basics. 'Beetlebum' and 'Song 2' stand out, but the rest is so much white noise......"
5,A very amazing and deep album,"Its wrong to critique this album to the tiniest note, because it was wonderfully composed, and thats that. Even though the songs were not created in a typical style (for example, the last song is 14 minutes long and barely any vocals) it was so cleverly done, and so soft and melodious and alternative and modern (yes all at the same time). All the songs had something very distinct about them,yet just because you dont understand it doesnt mean you cant enjoy it. Trust me, listen to some songs, it simply brilliant. There is not one song you wont like. After three years I still cant put this album down."
1,poor damon...,"what happened to these guys??? after 3 incredible albums they release this GARBAGE...though song 2 isnt the peak of blur's work the low point of this album is the song and video combo of ""on your own""...terrible garbage..what happened to damon?? why abandon an obviously superior british music for american bull garbage??"
2,So-so at best,"I bought this CD from the recomendation of a good friend of mine. When he told me that the infamous ""woo-hoo"" song (Song 2) was on the CD, I jumped at the chance to get the CD. Although Song 2 was a good song, I had a hard time to enjoy any other song on this CD. If it wasn't for Song 2, this would have been one star. If you can find a CD single of Song 2, get it, because this CD is not worth it."
2,average,"Sunshine Anderson has a decent voice,but she didn't come back with material that merits waiting six years between releases. the Songs&Production are 2nd to 3rd rate. the Lyrics are just plan generic. in truth I think She would have a better chance at doing Hooks than making albums for a minute.because Albums like this feel half-hearted. she showed some promise with her debut,but this album is over before it has a chance to start.vocally she is cool,but everything else needs a step way up."
4,Great CD,"I just Love Sunshine Anderson and being that i didn't own this Cd I am glad I added it to my collection, she is a great artist!!"
4,Nice,Sunshine has the potential to be around for long time in the business as long as she keeps some great writers creating material just for her! She can truly sing! Great CD!
5,A book to make you think,"In the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks, the US is rethinking its defense policy. Dr. Eland's book provides one blueprint for a transformation, and I hope military policymakers like Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld will read this book and consider Eland's recommendations.Although written before the attacks, the book predicts that terrorism is America's biggest threat in the coming decade, and proposes a defense policy that will reduce the chances of future attacks on the US homeland. You may not agree with all of Eland's viewpoints and recommendations, but I promise you will finish each chapter with a new perspective and a better understanding of America's role in the world."
5,Fantastic!!,"Although I LOVE his voice, I didn't want to take a chance on this one as there are no samples above and I hadn't heard any of his music since the late 80's. I read somewhere that it was an attempt to capture ""the feel"" of his live performance which also scared me. Luckily in this case,that doesn't mean a lot of audience clatter, sing-a-longs, and poor sound mixing. It is strictly acoustic which means that you actually hear real talent on the guitar (how unique)and the quality is absolutely excellent.The songs are beautiful and meaningful and I promise that you will find yourself singing them to yourself at work and in the shower. Don't let the lack of tracks above set you off. I made the decision to buy the album when I heard him sing My Brilliant Feat on an on-line radio broadcast out of one of the M states up North (sorry, they don't teach Texans geography).If you still have doubts, check out his official web site for sound bytes."
3,"Maybe I am in a slump, but...","I didn't enjoy this book as much as the others in the series. That will not turn me off of them though. I fulling intend to read the next one. I agree with others, not sure how I feel about Phil, will not go further with that one, do not want to spoil anything. If you have not read any of this series, please start with the first one, as the characters build up. Also, I missed Peggy, she didn't seem to make much of an appearance in this book."
2,They are not so good as their previous albums,Forget about Cruelty and the beast - Midian - Dusk and her embrace. This album is bad. It reminds me a little Nymphetamine with the childish melodies and the boring atmosphere. Its one of their worst albums and its only for Cradle Of Filth collectors.
4,"Not Black Metal, but Great Music","Yeah, if you look at them, they seem silly. But it's hard to deny these boys can create some brutal tunes. ""Libertina Grimm,"" and the experimental cover of ""Temptation"" make this cd worth it. As a fanatic of horror fiction, I appreciate the refrences to Barker and Lovecraft tales. They sound a bit like old Mercyful Fate at parts, or maybe its just me...A guilty pleasure perhaps, but I still say COF can hammer out some wicked tunes. A worthy album, IMO for metal fans."
4,Different.,"First of all, I love Cradle of Filth. I was completely psyched for the new album, and expected it to surpass Nymphetamine (which is by far my favorite CoF album). I put it into my cd player and listened to the whole thing. Saying I was dissappointed is an understatement. I was enraged. After accepting this tragedy, I moved on. A week later, I decided to give it another shot. I can say without a doubt that the song that saved this album for me was ""Libertina Grimm"". I was digging the guitars on it, so I kept listening to it. Eventually, I became more accepting of other songs. A week later, and I love the album. Sure, it's no Nymphetamine, and it is weak for Cradle of Filth, but I'm not ashamed to say I'm a fan of it. If you don't own Nymphetamine, buy that first and THEN buy Thornography. I'm done rambling."
4,Great for the acquired taste.,"As stated in the title, Cradle of Filth is an acquired taste. You either like them, or you don't. For those of you who don't like their music, quit bellyaching and just simply not buy their music. For those of you who like their music, stop being so quick to trash those who dislike it. Personally, I really like Cradle of Filth, and I feel like this CD is only their third best, but it is really good nonetheless. I've found that when listening to metal, death metal, black metal, whatever the case may be, that you have to poke and prod to see what groups you like. When you come across groups you don't like, you just have to move on to find another that you do like. For me, my taste lies in Cradle of Filth. For this album, I really like the songs Dirge Inferno, Tonight in Flames, and I Am The Thorn. I still think that Nymphetamine and Damnation and a Day were better albums, though."
4,This is really all you need to learn The Zone,"Don't bother with the longer books unless you want to get down and into the scientific data behind the Zone. And don't bother with the cookbook because it's absolutely horrible. This book explains the Zone and how to get there, has a few sample menu's (that should be used as guide's only) and a list of food 'blocks' in the back. It's all you need to get going. I highly recommend this book, and the Zone diet in general. I have lost 15 lbs in the past 7 weeks. It has been 7 easy weeks with 100% contentment and 0% hunger & struggles. I could not be happier."
2,Could be better,"The books in general are very informative. I followed the ""diet"" for 2 months and ended up gaining 30 pounds. I went to the forums at the website for help and was told that I did not follow the diet correctly. I followed the horrible thing for 2 solid months without success. Not only that, it is too expensive to do. My husband and I are on a strict budget, and this diet blew it to pieces. I know there are those who have had success with it, but let's be honest, this does not work for everybody. There is no diet that will work for everyone. If that were the case, we'd all be skinny....right? I'll go back to what works for me."
2,They had lost the plot by this one,"This album pretty much was the last gasp for the Maels aka Sparks. The rubbish they turned out aftre this album was pretty dreadful. Their doom was sealed when they had fired Martin Gordon and Adrian Fisher after the Kimono album. Gordon arranged most of the Kimono songs plus played bass and Fisher was an outstanding guitarist who played on Kimono and on a few songs on Propaganda.The good songs on this record are Happy Hunting Ground and In the Future. Looks Looks Looks and Get In The Swing are fair to middling. The rest of the record is a load of rubbish. This CD includes bonus tracks that include the dreadful ""England"" and horrendous remake of ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand.""Sparks could have been huge if they had stuck with the Kimono line up. Oh well the Maels live and suffer from sabotaging their moment at the top."
5,32 box filing system,"The filing system was delivered promptly. The weight of the box would have led me to believe that shipping should have cost more than it did, thankfully not.The directions could have been easier to follow had they had a few words instead of just numbered pictures .. Yes it is kind of self explanatory, but a little bit of literary would have been that much easier for assembly.Otherwise, it is a nice sturdy unit and so far it has been a great asset to my small office."
2,Not worth the price.,"For the price I thought this would be a quality item. The boards came with dings and broken corners,it is composite-particle board, but by the time I paid to send it back I'd be out more money and not have a paper sorter.There was very little packing material to protect pieces during shipping. Don't overload the slots or they fall out. I wanted to use this to keep different types of copy paper sorted next to my copy machine and to sort projects. A full ream of paper will not work in the upper slots. Took 2 of us 2 hours to put together. It went together fairly easily."
3,Could have been great,"I have been a fan of william Orbit for some years now, i love his style of electronic music, but i sometimes get frustrated with some of his songs. This album is great but the songs that i really like such as Bubble Universe are too short. This song takes like 3 minutes to build up and then finally its kicking in and then after 40 seconds later, its over. I dont get why musicians cut their songs so short especially when they sound so great. Seriously if some of the of songs would just go on a few more minutes i would give this ablum 5 stars.."
3,Surfing wavelengths,"For those seeking a hard core electronica or some sort of edgy off the hook endeavor into spacemusic, this might be a bit deceiving. However if your intent is to enjoy an overall pleasant set of soothing pieces and you are not yet familiar with what electronica is (a generic term here...we could discuss for hours...), then I think this hits the nail. It has a great balance to it, easily accessible, not overly thriving into difficult territory and alternates between pure musical and vocal/musical.Some tunes I really enjoy (Spiral which has a great female/male chorus and Firebrand a fine piece of interesting mix with cascading notes and morphing sounds) and in all I would say it's a great Zen record, soothing and agreeable. It even includes strings, a folk like guitar at times which enhances the pleasure of simplicity. The compositions are well timed, it has the seal of an experienced artist, no doubt.If you wanna surf safely and reach the shore relaxed, get on these waves..."
1,very letdown,"I am very let down by the quality and appearance of this ring. the garnet is beautiful~ it has wonderful color and light. but the quality of the silver is so dull and lackluster, honestly, it looks like those rings i used to buy as a child that were displayed in foam rubber at the dime store. No matter the quality of the garnet, it looks like a complete fake because the silver around it looks like tin! The detail of the mold is very good, but again, the silver has no glimmer, no weight.I cleaned it with jewelry cleaner and there was no improvement. I am highly disappointed as I love some of the other designs by this vendor. but honestly, i don't even want to wear the ring it looks so awful."
4,"The ""other"" Bouchard rocks with power, mood & melody!","What an ear-opener this was! Until I got my hands on SOLID CITIZENS, I never realized just how important and how big a part Joe Bouchard played in the bulk of BOC's music. Like brother Albert (whose 4th Brain Surgeons album, MALPRACTISE, was released about the same time as this), his creativity and imagination were at least as vital to BOC as his playing-- and singing, which I know I've heard lots of, but somehow never really noticed before! My faves here include ""Hot Time In Hell"", ""On Fire With Love"" (do I sense a thematic follow-up to ""Burnin' For You""?), ""Wild Ones"" (a tribute to Marlon Brando & bikers everywhere), ""Dreamland"", ""Dream Machine"" and ""Run For The Sun"". I enjoyed this MORE than most of The Brain Surgeons' material, and nearly as much as some BOC albums-- no small praise! Barring a reunion, I hope we'll hear more from Joe before too long."
4,Awsome.,i received the book in the mail today been reading it learned a lot in what little bit that i have read. hopefully will help me with a career in the military in the future.
5,Top Shelf,"I find the book to be well written, illustrated and photographed. This is an A-Z encylopedia for long range rifle shooting. I am new to long range shooting and find this book to be the best start to finish. I may not want to be a sniper but it is interesting to read and the info can be applied to many situations. I am sure this will be dog eared in no time and I think it will serve me well for many years to come."
4,The Ultimate Sniper (II),"This is a good manual except it is too journalistic, with a lot of stories thrown in which SHOULD have been edited out and put in another book. Plus sniping has changed a lot during the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts and info on patrol-sized sniper groups is not included, as well as info on the latest scopes and reticles, ALSI attatchments and snap-on night/thermal vision devices that do not require day scopes to be re-adjusted.It DOES include info on ballistic PDA computers which is nice. The technical end of sniping is evolving so rapidly that Plaster can be forgiven for not including the latest night vision and thermal devices, not to mention new rifles and scopes. All this can be found on such websites as ""Snipers Hide"", etc."
4,Quite Good,"It was a good, brief account of a woman's participation in the IRA, and it was all pretty much first-hand experience, so straight from the horse's mouth. The only problem I have with the book is that McGuire spent most of it either bashing MacStiofain or depicting, in tenuous detail, press releases or strategies. I wish she had added more from her personal life, to really give perspective on how the IRA had changed all aspects of her daily routine."
4,Curiously surprising.,"Although the title causes one to think of certain films involving certain speedy actresses, the subtitle, ""The Unanticipated Consequences of Computerization,"" sets a tone more like that of the book itself.Working from the perspectives of both the natural and social sciences, Rochlin proposes the interesting idea that our great reliance upon computers and computerized artifacts has significant consequences outside of equipment failure or the deskilling of labor.Although the organization of the book is somewhat poor, I consider the text a must for anyone interested in the overall relationship between technology and human life"
4,"She sings some, she fakes some","Although we LOVE Valerie Dore (real name: Monica Stucchi), this record confirms the legend (pun intended) that she did not sing most of her songs. The big hits (It's so easy, Into the Night) are actually sung by the woman that later was the lead singer of another Italo disco pop band (Novecento) and Valerie sang the rest... you can totally hear the different voices... but we forgive her because we love her hair, the fishnet stocking and gloves..."
5,Moneymaker,"This is a great product and very heart healthy. It was packaged very good and except for there not being enough in stock at the time of my order, I received it in a timely manner."
2,Crazy movie! an Acid trip on film! What were they thinking???,"This movie is unbelievable! I dont think they were thinking at all. The only reason I bought it is because Jayne Mansfield is in it for a brief second, seen attending a premiere. It is a crystal clear copy of this film, which previously i only had a horrible colector copy. It is typical of the Hippie type documentary films that were being made for Drive-in propaganda at the time in the late sixties. If you are thinking you can sit and enjoy an intellectual film about the sixties, forget this film. If your buying it because of some other reason, that is the only reason to do so."
1,"songwriting is good, performance needs work","John Mellencamp and Henry lee Summers are free clinics'main influences.I keep waiting for them to ""rock out"" but the fire isnt there."
2,Doodlebop imposters,"This DVD is of the ""old"" Doodlebops. They look like they're wearing masks with big ears. DeeDee has a very big, unflattering costume on. Jazzmin is a thinner woman who's name is Jazz. Very different from the current Doodlebops seen on TV. Would not recommend this, they've changed for a reason. My daughter loves the Doodlebops, but will not watch this DVD."
2,Waste of 20 bucks!!,"Worst flash lite ever. Im shocked gerber put there name on this pile. Bought it for hunting and u cant see past the length u can even walk. Thought it would of been bigger too. This thing is about 3"". Guess the only thing u can use it for is looking for a pen in the junk drawer in the kitchen. Idk. Coulda went to the dollar store if i wanted that. Only thing this one has on the dollar store is a lifetime warranty if it breaks apart. Lol. Guess they planed that one cuz they know no ones gonna use it cuz its worthless. Thats my opinion."
3,Great flashlight but....,"A little expensive for a 3"" flashlight!There is no ""on/off"" button, you just screw the back on or off a little to get it to go on or off. It works as advertised so I'm not dissapointed but I think I could have done better on the price. Looks like it would fit nice on a key ring."
4,"Cool light, weak clip","The clip is a nice edition, but don't expect it to stay on the brim of your hat if you are running or brush up against something. The clip isn't that strong. The light is bright enough to navigate through the house, but don't expect to use it on your back forty for spotting deer."
4,Fun novelty,"Not very bright, but easy to move between color modes. Really, really small. Great for night map reading or where very little light is needed or night vision is an issue. Has a clip, clip to what? Shirt pocket maybe. Way too small to clip on a belt. Just kind of a little item you can carry without really noticing it. Not for any serious maneuvers but useable. Good for an ultra light weight night vision unit. Kids would love this."
5,Beautiful and Moving -- A Timeless Fantasy,"Reading this short, powerful novel is like falling into a dream from which it is hard to awaken. Dunsany's prose is deliciously rich, and he moves through this tale of love and loss and strange longing with infinite grace, never laboring over a point or rushing the majestic pace. Those who are too entrenched in modern prose styles certainly might find the work lacking in the kind of day-to-day detail of the characters' lives, but readers should approach this work with more of a sense of the classic fairy tale or perhaps the biblical parable. I intend to pass this book along to everyone I know who enjoys a good story, and I hope to read it again many times myself!"
3,Dunsany's King of Elfland's Daughter,"This book, alkthough highly influential in the world of fantasy is more of a fairy-tale than anything else. It does have some similiar relationships between itself and works influenced by it. Chief amongst these being: J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings Triology. These include forbidden woods, deserted lands and characters such as goblins, trolls and elves. Trolls in Dunsay's world are more of a lark than a thing of great fear as they are in other classic works. Elves in his work are also more supsicious of mankind than they are in Tolkien's world too. This is especially the case in Tolkien's prequel to the Lord of the Rings triology, the Simallarion, where they eagerly anticipated the arrival of mankind.Bottom line is, if you want to see where Tolkien derove some of his ideas from, read this book. However, it is best to read other contemporary sources of influence too, including the works of E.R. Eddison."
1,Boring waste of time,"An utterly boring waste of time. The book is full of words, a veritable word factory, written in pseudo-lyrical style, but the plot is predicable and as the reader nears the end of the book, the terrible realization begins to dawn that it's all leading nowhere. The trite ending eventually confirms the reader's well-founded fear.There is absolutely no similarity between the fourth rate plotting and second rate use of language of Dunsany and that of J. R. R. Tolkien. The Hobbit and Lord of The Rings are poetic, heroic, epic, something to which Dunsany might aspire in his dreams, but then he -- and his duped reader -- must wake up to real life....I should have known I was in for a disappointment when I saw that great self-important mediocrity, Neil Gaiman, involved himself in the book by writing an utterly meaningless introduction.As for Del Rey publishing bringing this book back from its well-deserved oblivion, they really shouldn't have."
1,duped again.....,"I'm an old, I mean old fan of MBM... Which is why I drove way out of my way to aquire this album... In Dub, Indeed... the only thing this album has to do with ""DUB"" is it's title track... the fact this platter was spun out is testimony that Jack needs a bigger boat for his CD release parties. Jack, you wouldn't know dub if it bit you square on the ass..."
5,Wonderful,This book is just wonderful :)I had it only 24 hours but I know it is the best written creative book I have so far.I sculpt with polymer clay and new ideas are always welcome and I truly did find some really good ideas.SUPER!!!
2,THIS IS NOT THE SAME BAND WE USED TO KNOW,"im not really writting this review to put down the band...but this album (and the one released after it, Songs for the Living) is definitely nothing like the great hardcore/metal albums they released before. if your looking for some mainstream rock then this isnt a bad choice. in fact, after listening to a few samples, it actually reminded me a lot of creed. creed is a talented band and all, but just not my kind of music. i REALLY like embodyments earlier albums and i think its a shame that the band has changed so much. if you want some heavy gutwrenching metal then check out the earlier albums. but if you want some really toned down, mainstream rock, well then i guess this cd is for you."
2,Good recipes but way too many pictures,"I love shopping at Williams-Sonoma for kitchen equipment, specialized ingredients, and to get new ideas. There are many good recipes in this book covering the different seasons in the year. If you are looking for Easter Brunch, a Seaside Supper or High Tea, you will find something you can use.My complaint about this book is more than 50% of the pages are nothing but pictures. I guess if you are looking for a coffee table book, this is the book for you. If on the other hand you are looking for recipes, well there are some, but a majority of the book is nothing but pictures."
2,so bad...taste like melted wax.,"Horrible. They taste like melted wax. There is no licorice flavor at all. They aren't even a dark red, they are faded looking. I am tossing all of them in the trash. Save your money. These are the worst I have ever tasted. Thank God I didn't spend a lot on them. Give me twisters or Good & Plenty."
2,You get what you pay for.,"After reading several positive reviews of this headset, I decided to try them out. Big waste of time. To start, the construction of these is very flimsy. The earpiece is made of hard plastic and seems very prone to breaking easily (I've only had mine a week so far). I have a somewhat average size ear, and I couldn't get the earpiece to stay in place for more than 2-3 minutes. Also, the sound quality is very tinny."
5,Columbia Record Club,"For a great film, I wonder what significance there is to the fact that the movie is set near the end of May 1967 (Calendar on a wall with May and June showing, ""Somebody to love"" on a transistor radio, School still on in Springtime, Tornado Season), But the Columbia record club Phone call had the featured album for April was Santana's Abraxas and For May was Creedence Clearwater Revival's Cosmos Factory. Both records not released until 1970!Love the Columbia record club, the selections come and you don't have to do anything, But Pay up.Also it was a transistor radio that was confiscated, So how did the Rabbi(Was he Dumbledore's lost brother?) pick up on the song ""Somebody To Love"" so astutely? I don't mind as the song was used so effectively in this movie."
1,Waste of Time - Might as well watch ice melt (more interesting),"Don't bother with the cerebral analysis some folks are trying to attach to this movie - it is a complete waste of time. Ask yourself ""Why is this new release- watch it now option- going for $1.99 when all other new releases are $3.99"" Is it because it's a bargain? NOT - you can't give this movie away! Slow and boring doesn't even begin to cover the tedious dullness of this film. If you are tied to a chair and forced to watch this, at least drink heavily so you can immediately pass out and save yourself from a stunning waste of film."
3,Good film marred disc,I'd already seen the film in the theater. I liked the extra features. Unfortunately the disc arrived with a scratch .Except for that problem I'm pleased. As the film says at the beginning__ 'Accept everything that happens to you with simplicity.' Rashi
3,Jewish Humor Without the Humor,"The title gives It away. This is a very serious movie. Was it supposed to be funny? Raising Arizona and The Big Lebowski were funny. I tried to laugh with this one, but found nothing to even smile at.If you want Jewish humor, watch a Woody Allen movie, many of which are laugh out loud funny. Sleeper, Love and Death and Annie Hall are hilarious. This one, not so much. Go figure."
2,It's not a good sign when you....,"...fall asleep about half way through a movie. All the way to the end. I'll admit I was tired when it began, but to actually fall asleep?! Very dull, IMO. Surprising, because I really dig a lot of Coen flicks, and was really looking forward to this one. Woody Allen does this stuff much better - funnier, sadder and more poignant, far more cleverly, and with better music. Can't win 'em all. Will look forward to their next, hope to see them again reach the heights of Fargo, Lebowski, and Man Who Wasn't There."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"With the DVD jacket literally covered in 4-star reviews and having loved previous Coen Brothers movies, I thought this was a sure thing. Well, it's probably one of the top three worst movies I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through. Please save yourself two hours and watch something else."
2,Lost opportunity,"[Based upon Theatre viewing].Depressing, downbeat results for a movie which should have taken advantage of good actors, who obviously are capable of delivering a powerful scene. Terrible story construction and sometimes questionable mix of the ""new"" values with the ""old"", really mar a decent idea.The ""serious"" man is well-intentioned and respectful of tradition...but has a wife who cheats (I'm not clear if it's because he's boring) and a son who messes with street drugs. His response is ""I didn't do anything!"" How could this happen? When did things get out of control?Would taking things less seriously help? The viewer has no clue.Very unsatisfying and unsettling ending, for the stale cherry on top.."
2,Hebrew Overload,"If you love the Coen brothers you probably won't be reading these before deciding whether to watch or not. If you're not familiar with them than you should not start with this film. The movie has a good openning scene with an old Jewish couple living in 18th century Europe. They end up with a curse struck down upon them.Then we are in present day Minnesota with a physics teacher and family man who is a descendant of the old couple(or maybe just another jew in another time). His life starts falling apart with one unfortunate event after another as he lets everyone in his life walk all over him. The movie continues with the usual Coen dark comedy. The ending is abrupt and stupid. I'm all for satire, but all the stereotypes get to be a bit much. The Coens could have done a better job with this one."
4,Classic Coen Brothers dark comedy (not for everyone),"After the likes of ""No Country For Old Men"" and ""Burn After Reading"" which oddly didn't seem like Coen Brother films to me, this movie was a welcome return to the style of some of their earlier work such as ""The Man Who Wasn't There"", ""Fargo"" and ""Barton Fink"", although I did find the ending to be more abrupt and less satisfying than these other films. Then again most of their movies only get better after repeated viewings.This won't be everybody's cup of tea.Still, if you like the Coen's previous style of dark comedies (and this one will rank amongst their darkest), their offbeat sense of humor, their meticulous attention to sets and details, the quirky characters nailed by some superb performaces, then ""A Serious Man"" should work for you."
4,Perfect gift for my boyfriend.,"As Coen brothers films usually, it was long and it was dark. I kept waiting for something good to happen for the main character, but that's kind of the whole point of the film. However, I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend's birthday since it is his favorite movie and was forever complaining that he couldn't find it anywhere - got it at a good price and fit the bill quite nicely."
4,Dracula Descendants,"Ep with six tracks, contains three tracks from previous releases (""Vampires"", ""Dracula Descendants"" and ""Prisoner Of The Night"") recorded again. ""Bloodletting"" is a cover of Concrete Blonde record (from an album with the same title), featuring female vocalist named Pepper Mayer. I think that this album is over produced, so that's why just four stars!"
3,Fair First Novel,"An interesting book about war. Too many subplots which makes the story a bit confusing. The story is too shallow. I liked the action though. The ending was lame. It also kept me wondering if the novel was really about war, or was it about love? A Fair One for Francis Cottam's First Novel."
3,dated,This might have been amazing when it was released but it is very dated now. Everything sounds like it was made with samples found on the internet. A few tracks are really well structured but others carry on for 8 minutes and dont have much progression what so ever. Be prepared to here the same loops carry through the entire songs. There are few electronic albums that will stand the test of time. This is not one of them.
5,the origional Valdemar book,"I read this book origionaly 15 years ago and have been hooked sense.This was the first of the 30 books for this world. when you see reviews saying it was a repete of a diffrent book, they are wrong, the other book is a similar story, written much later."
5,VERY GOOD,"THE AUDIBOOK WAS VERY GOOD, AN IT STAYED WITH THE STORY AS WAS IN THE BOOK. BUT , FOR THE AMOUNT THAT I PAID FOR THE AUDIOBOOK, I THINK IT COULD HAVE COME IN A MUCH BETTER JACKET. I PAID LESS FOR CHRISTINA FEEHAN,S AUDIOBOOKS, AN THEY CAME IN A VERY NICE JACKET. AN I KNOW THAT MERCEDES LACKEY , IS AS GOOD OF AN AUTHOR AS CHRISTINA FEEHAN. ALL IN ALL. THE AUDIOBOOK IS VERY GOOD. I WILL ALSO GET ALL OF MERCEDES LACKEYS BOOK AS THAY COME OUT ON DISK.THANK YOULOUISE FORREST"
5,One of my favorite books,"I have read this book almost 7 times. I love it! I recommend this book to anyone who loves Mercedes Lackey as much as I do. I own all of her Valdemar series, except for Take a Thief."
2,Too Close for Comfort,"This book is entirely too much like Anne McCaffrey's Harper Hall trilogy. Let's see: young girl with abusive males in her past runs away from her overly restrictive home, gets lucky and ends up in a Hall with Healers etc, and happens to live in a world with Companions entirely too similar to McCaffrey's dragons (telepathic mind link & all). Oh and she finds she loves to sing (like Menolly) and she also suffers all sorts of bully problems (like Piemur deals with in _Dragon Drums_). And I think at one point the place is actually called a ""Hold"" too.If you read this book and loved it, read Anne McCaffrey's series and you will see that the writing there is vastly superior to Lackey's. And those books were written 10 years earlier.I hope the next books in this series make up for this oh-so-sweet (and completely predictable) first book."
5,Very good choice,"Normaly, when you buy an apparel item, you must pay neither more nor less than its exact quality. This happened to me with these gloves. Also, there is no misleading in the presentation of the product. These gloves are very soft, warm enough and suitable for a country with soft winter."
3,Average,"This game is recommended for players who are engaged to play business-type of games seriously. But if you are finding something fun and quite enjoyable, then this game is not for you.Pros:-the game has many types of features; different kinds of floors, gates,shops, personnel and much more-behind ur expectaions.-has some thrill when dogs and criminals enter your mall. How can you deplete them out?-unlimited floors (i have made 4 floors out of it)Cons:-the game, after doing ur mall, starts to get boring.-the graphics of the population are blurred, and the face of each character is so damn simple.-the music is boring.-researches for your mall takes too much time...even doing it at the same time makes it more slower-cheats are not working on itSo there."
2,Bad GAME!!!,"You do not want to buy this game is is so boring. and i doesn't give you half of the things to make a mall!!! it will be a waste of your money i promise! But instead of buying thing you should get sims, sims 2, or my favorite game of all time it is better than roller coster tycoon! SIMS COASTER you will love it!!"
1,Too non stick,"I have used this pan several times. I have pre-baked my shell each time, and each time the crust slides down into the pan. Ugh, it's horrible. I also have a hard time fluting the crust. I consider myself pretty good at pies...this pan sucks."
1,Yawn,Two self absorbed people stroll along the streets of Paris with hardly a soul to be seen. Have the people who made this movie ever been to Paris? They walk down the middle of streets with no one else around and not a car to be seen. They would be road kill in a matter of seconds. They literally avoid the sidewalks and walk down the middle of the street.The two characters had absolutely no personlaity or chemistry. It seemed they were each giving a speech w/o concern w/ how the other person reacted. I was sorely disappointed.
5,Well worth buying the DVD,"I loved Before Sunrise and my expectations for Before Sunset were high.............and they were definitely met!Before Sunset actually gives the audience credit for having enough imagination to figure out what is or isn't happening in this movie. It is one of the most mature romances I have seen yet. Buy this movie and the prequel and you will not be disappointed.Hummm? Two people....what was......what could have been....what may be??? Could you ask for more? This movie has everything. But be warned.........if you want all of your dialogue handed to you on a silver platter, if you want is ""spelled"" out for you, if you like your movies ""easy"" then stay away. It's not for you. You should go see Star Wars III instead and you may be more satisfied."
1,"Talk, Talk, and More Talk, But No Ending","This movie is basically nothing more than a dialogue. Close your eyes and you won't miss anything, except Ethan Hawke's constant smirking. The dialogue is very dry and boring. After stringing us along for what seemed like 12 hours, the movie doesn't even reward is with some kind of resolution to their relationship. It's not ambiguous in an interesting way. It's just flat. It deflates any interest you may have had in the story, such as it is. This is an insufferable movie; maybe not the worst made in 2004, but the worst I saw in 2004."
3,THey're back,"So yes this is the sequal and they are making another one, they get back together but they are both married"
3,Before Sunset,"This small film needs a second look. More than ten years after they made Before Sunrise, [[ASIN:B00002E224 Before Sunrise] Delpy and Hawke meet again, this time in Paris. Don't expect a travelogue, although there are some nice scenes around the Seine. It's adult talk about their relationships, life since the first one-day meeting in Vienna, and it demands full attention. It has more in common with ""My Dinner with Andre"" than the usual romance movie. It could not have taken many days to shoot and has the look and sound of dialogue that was off the cuff at times. But for the most part it works and his earnestness and her quirkiness keep our interest. It ends suddenly, but about the only way it could. Nice way to spend part of an evening."
4,101 answers to questions leaders ask,Informative. The questions were general enough that the information can be applied to many managers in their workplace. Yet the content was applicable because the writer was writing specifically about hospital management.
5,101 Answers to Questions Leaders Ask,This is a really good book is that it does what it says. You can look at the different areas of the book and the questions and it is a concise way to get information. I have used it often since I have bought it and it helps me to get my thoughts in order. Very pleased with all aspects of the book.
1,Not another compilation!,"Donna Summer must have had a really bad lawyer or else she's overmilked her catalog because this CD is probably the 10th or 11th ""Greatest Hits"" CD. Yes, her music is fun to listen to. And yes, many of her songs have stood the test of time. But to keep rehashing ""Best of"" collections is just demeaning to fans who have waited for years for new material! Sorry, Donna, enough is enough!"
3,"Good for the price, Poor user manual","The DVD plays fine and sounds good(no DTS, tho). Getting the microphones to work was not explained in the virtually worthless user manual. I found, through a user review, that you have to go to the karaoke setup menu and select ""auto"" for the microphone. ""Auto"" appears to be the default, but unless you manually select ""auto"" (!), the mics won't work. I bought it for karaoke and fun, not viewing movies, so it does that job fine."
2,"Great drill, bad NiCad batteries","I purchased this 14.4 combo set back in December 2006. It is now June 2008 and one of my batteries is totally dead. I use the drill heavily. I depend on both batteries. Now I am down to one and the warranty for NiCad batteries is 1 year. I like the drill but now instead of spending mucho $$$ on another battery I will probably go with a different brand.Drill and worklight are both great though, just not without a battery."
2,Don't buy it Heart Of Wisdom users!,"Homeschoolers,I bought this book new here on Amazon for my Heart Of Wisdom curriculum.Don't make the same mistake I did. It is NOT worth it! If I had seen it in person I would have not bought it.The book is only 1/4 inch thick, not a good value.There is a short text for each page and on the opposite page is the most UGLY art I have seen in a book or anywhere else in a long time.There are better places to spend your money for cool living books than on this book.SKIP IT."
1,old fashioned,"it is varied, with designes for babies, women, etc' but nothing that I realy would like to make. seems boring. I am sorry for buying it."
5,Beautiful,For anyone who desires to build a home for the Lord within the walls of their heart. Rebecca Barlow Jordan has written a book of interior RE-design that every believer who seeks intimacy with God should read.
3,Short and Sweet,Short well thought answers to many of today's pertinent questions. It is interesting how much most Americans don't understand the Libertarians point of view.
2,Don't recommend,"Don't recommend this product at all.First, the plate you get is made of melamine. This was the chemical that was used in China to dilute infant formula resulting in many children's deaths.Secondly, you can't microwave these plates. So what you end up with is a decoration to clutter up your cabinet space.Finally, you must wait for the plate to be made and this company's customer service has fallen off dramatically. It used to be a well run family business but no more."
5,"Thank goodness for a non-weepy, finally grown-up Guinevere!","Traditional versions of the Arthur myth focus mainly on the men. Other versions like Mists of Avalon, which I enjoy immensely, focus women characters and not much, really, on the weepy, very Christian Guinevere.Beloved Exile is a smashing alternate view of the possibilities, given the times. Guinevere in this version is not construed as a saint, a hystrionic weeper, nor is she totally lovable, but is very human. She is a strong, unforgettable character.Highly recommended!"
3,Decent... not great.,"I bought this pan and at first was confused by the removable bottom. ( I didn't know that a lot of tarte/quiche pans have that feature? after some googling, i soon learned that it is made that way in order to allow the finished product to be easily removed). However, this feature presented a bit of a problem for me while baking. I made a chocolate tart, which is a very soupy/liquidy batter before it bakes and hardens, and while it was in the oven baking there were little droplets dripping down from that part where the two pieces meet. this was pretty irritating and made my oven messy."
5,BRILLIANT,I can't believe the difference this made to my trucks bullbar and stacks. They now have a mirror shine. FANTASTIC!!
3,Decent book,"Though I have read Nora Roberts before, this is the first JD Robb/In Death book I have read. It was interesting, since this is set in the future. Though this was part of a series, I was able to understand the characters and events fairly well, so kudos to Nora Roberts for that.However, the story overall did not pique my interest enough to want to check out the other books in this series. It's not that the writing was terrible or anything, but I do feel it could have been a bit better/developed, a few of the sentences and descriptions were awkwardly written. Others will like this sci-fi series more than I do."
5,3rd in a series of equally wonderful excitement and romance,"Twists and Turns are everywhere, with a plot that growswith the number of pages. Eve Dallas unravels the police'scase against her best friend and gets the real killer.Suspensful and romantic. A truely good read."
1,This card sucks. Don't Buy,"This card has a known issue with many motherboards. When i purchased this product I had an msi k7n2 motherboard. this card installed fine but upon restart ""found new hardware"" icon popped up. I thought somehthing was wrong with my motherboard. So i went out and bought a new motherboard and processor. this time an msi k8n neo2 but to no avail. This card still does the same thing.If you doubt me go and check creative support site. There are hundereds of people out there with the same problem.DO NOT BUY."
4,Quite pleased,"Great sound, easy installation. Only negative is Mic and audio in share the same port."
2,"Lots of promises, not much to back it up","This card simply does not perform to it's product specifications and marketing claims. This can mostly be attributed to the terrible sound drivers that cause a multitude of problems. Such problems include random sound distortions, popping, broken microphone input etc. Yes that's right this XtremeGamer sound card does not currently feature working support for microphones. Customer support is also rather terrible so no one on the support forums has received any support for these problems. Do yourself a favor and look towards the Auzentech or BlueGear range of sound cards, as they actually function."
1,I can't believe anyone likes this!,"I bought this album a couple of years ago during my Heavy Metal phase. Even at that time in my life, I couldn't abide this album. I tried, I really did. I listened to it over and over, even though it hurt my brain. I tried to pretend the lyrics made some sense (if you imagine a pretentious monkey at a typewriter, you're half-way there).Reading through the other reviews here, I realise that my lack of musical knowledge (ie I can't play the guitar) may inhibit my enjoyment of this music, so you can probably put me in a box marked 'just don't get it'.The only use I've found for this album is annoying my neighbours."
2,Possibly the most overated band EVER...,"Yes, that's right I gave the great(?) Meshuggah 2 stars... Pff... It seems like everyone is obsessed with this band. To me, they blow. Every song sounds the same (which isn't always a bad thing...but not just on this CD, practically EVERY song they've EVER made sounds identical)... Some good musicianship but not too much, just a lot of stupid riffing then another background guitar trying to sound all sci-fi, lmao. If you want the weird chaotic time signatures I recommend Dillenger Escape Plan over this band (I don't like them much either but they blow this band away.) For sheer technicality just listen to any of Decapitated's material. For an overall good listen, check out Into Eternity - Buried in Oblivion... Their older in my opinion doesn't measure up to the newer."
3,"vastly overrated, worst meshuggah album","i dont know why everyone likes this album so much. i think its their worst. one, the production is horrible. ""elastic"" and ""millenium cyanide christ"" are good songs but the rest is dissappointing. this is like destroy erase improve songs (but definitely not as good) with contradictions collapse production.i love all of their other albums, but when i throw this one in, i am reminded why i dont ever listen to it."
1,Wow...,$15.95 to ship 6 candy bars? Seriously??? I hope they're coming direct from Australia for that price!
5,My wife says 10+,To bad you have to get it from Australia and wait forever but it's the best seafome type candy around. I was surprised and didn't remember it being that good. That's a switch!
4,"Staggering talent ,brilliant song, shame about remixes","I have an edition of this tune with versions of ""Como duele perderte""as a bonus.It has no ""Miami"" mix but instead some currently fashionable but musically remedial work by Richie Santana,Magnus Hansson& Citizens Kaned.Please Emilio& Gloria don't let these individuals near any of your future releases! Perhaps Marcos Valle or Chris Duckenfield would honor the work more.I have thoroughly enjoyed the Morales and Rosabel mixes in the past but this time round Emilio& Robert Blades'Tropical version of ""Como"" is the 24 carat bomb!Long may the Estefans'rock my world."
5,Other Ways of Hearing,"""Other Ways of Speaking,"" the latest effort from Tofog, is an album (disc) that gets better with each hearing. It is solid, as was ""Bastard Life or Clarity,"" and is filled with story songs that open the song writers, Crowe and Cochran, up for us to understand and witness the vulnerability of these men. Crowe is bold, a daring writer who is not afraid to show his vulnerability. This is what makes the songs so powerful, and so touching. They are real. I love this disc. I loved ""Bastard Life."" The songs continue to be interesting and strong lyrically and musically, and the band -- well, the band is explosively gorgeous and solid."
1,He can act and he can write but the man cannot sing,"I bought this album with great expectations because I love Russell as an actor, but I think his singing must be an acquired taste and I'm not willing. If the band played alone this would be a fabulous listen, they are very good, but Russell's singing only gets in the way. Do yourself a favor and listen to the samples before you spend money on this album. Russell writes very well but his words are not really conducive to lyrics, there are just too many of them."
1,I'm sorry......da Vinci??,"Someone just compared Russell Crowe...a worthless actor, to Leonardo da Vinci??? Quit reading your celebrity magazines and pick up a book now and then, sweetie."
3,Not the best but good,"Only the Beatles can play Beatles music, but this is an honest effort by heavy metal artist to honor the greatest songwriters of all time, so it's worth buying."
3,Beatles Tribute,"A pretty good CD for metal heads who are open to Classic Rock. These songs aren't ""updated"" like some reviewers say they are. They sound very similar to the originals, but with more 70's style distortions and guitar playing. Everything pretty much sounds like KISS really. People who say they are updated for the 21st century obviously haven't heard any great rock before 1990. This CD is not impressive. It can only be impressive to those who don't know the Classic Rock greats, which this CD has a good lineup of them. So, it's not worth it for us grownups, but Metallica loving kids may want to check it out to know what Classic Rock sounds like."
4,Nice gift,"It was a gift for an adult child and they,liked it very much. I would recommend for any one over 10."
5,Love it all!,"Characters run true and stay consistent (not easy to do with a TV series). Repartee is fun, the cases serious, the company worth visiting regularly. Watch this series this way (with no commercials) and see if you don't anxiously await the next episode!"
4,Not a fan at first,"Initially I was not enamored with this series and did not watch the first season after dismissing it. However, my husband started watching the reruns and liked the show. Some characters need time to develop and that was the case with this show and I'm glad I stuck with it a little longer as I am now a fan. There is great chemistry between Angie Harmon and Sasha Alexander and it shows in the Jane and Maura characters. Shasha Alexander is better in this character than she was as Kate on NCIS."
4,GREAT SERIES,I LOVE THIS TV SERIES. I CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON OPENER. IT IS AN UP BEAT TV SHOW. BETTER THAN REALITY SHOWS.(SO SICK OF THOSE).
2,"Sadly, this product was misleading","By itself, the work is well done. What I was looking for was a DVD version of the ""Spirit"" that was performed in Green Bay, Wisconsin in 1999 (I think). I have the VHS version and have watched it dozens of times. Of course, VHS is going the way of the Dodo bird. The new version falls short of the old one that was first aired on PBS. The modern dance company added the punch that is needed to make the production really pop."
3,"Two Great Songs, and a Whole Lot of Filler","Like many dance albums, ""Don't Stop Movin'"" has 2 great songs and a ton of filler tracks. The single ""Dreamer"" is an infectious number that shot straight to the top of the UK charts in the 1990s, and the title track, a message of positivity and determination, also shines. Not much else does, though. The rest of the songs range from middling to awful. The ballad which closes this album falls into the latter category. It's just badly written and badly sung. This CD isn't a total disaster, but you're truthfully better off getting their singles instead."
5,Wish I could give it 6 stars,"This is one of the best of Judith Ivory's books. Since Judith Ivory's romantic fiction is at the top of the genre, that makes this one of the better romance novels. It is so much fun to read, I found myself in the unusual situation of trying not to finish it - it was such an enjoyable read. The combination of the love story with the con game - both of which really engage you, gives this book two wonderful themes that prevent you from putting this book down. Don't dismiss this as another typical romance novel - it belongs in a more respected category. I loved this book and can't wait for her next one."
1,Boring,It was a boring book. I didn't like the Emma Hotchkins. There was no love connection between them. It took me 2 weeks to read and i didn't finish reading it.I would not recommend this book.
3,misrepresented,"The picture is not what will be sent. It is a picture of 7700 recieved 7800. Granted, the ad says 7800/7700, but I beleive the picture should reflect the item being sold. I bought one based on this concept, and no they don't carry the 7700.The picture has been updated to reflect the actual item. Good for all. I've added a star. I still have the item for which I have no use though."
2,track forward backward function broken,"Pretty looking, but functionally it's ""personality"" has little to say for itself (like most of the girls I used to know, and dropped like a bad habit- I have one particularly in mind at the moment but I digress).Basically, in an organically honest nutshell, you know the buttons you press to move to the next track or the one before ( < > ) ?They are defective- you have to apply over five then ten pounds of pressure to get 'it' to respond.. then she, I mean it (sorry) breaks altogether.Dear J-win company,Get it together...because this time you lost."
1,making and keeping creative journals,"delivery was as expected, but the pages 81 to 89 had been torn from the book, reported this to amazon, but no replacement was available , stuck with a book that is missing the most important information, the mthods of sewing !!!"
5,Love this pan!,"I have used this pan half a dozen times and each time it has made beautiful, evenly baked cakes. I did have an issue with the cakes sticking when I used butter and flour, but Pam has a baking cooking spray with flour in it that works wonderfully and prevents the cakes from sticking. I used the pan last night to make dessert for a dinner party and the little cakes were a real crowd pleaser."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"Wanted to make mini rum cakes as Christmas gifts. These were perfect. Only thing I didn't like is that if you ice cakes made in this pan they end up looking like donuts. So instead I had to glaze them or just sprinkle powdered sugar on them. They were still good, so pleased with my purchase over all."
3,It was not the CD I thought it would be.,"I was a bit disappointed with this CD although there really are nice songs in it. Perhaps, I'd had too much expectation, thinking it would be like the New Yorkish ""When-Harry-Met-Sally"" CD which was just great! I guess the reason how come it just made me feel fair is that there were no strong male voices like Nat King Cole, Michael Feinstein, or Harry Connick, Jr. Sorry, but I have to say that this CD was merely okay; I would give them three stars."
3,Didn't help my situation,"I have an iPod 5th or 6th gen (I don't remember which), and the ""Sennheiser HD-280 Professional Headphones"". My problem with these headphones on the iPod was that bass wasn't coming through very strong. Otherwise the sound was good. Bass came through the phones decently with other sources, so I figured that with a the right headphone amp I could get the bass I wanted. As it turned out, the Boostaroo was not that headphone amp. I do intend to keep it around, though, for its ability to split signals, that's pretty neat."
2,Boostaroo with a Zune,"I bought the Boostaroo with Splitter even after reading some negative reviews about it (and all but 1 of the Boostaroo products). I was hoping for 2 things: to reduce the load on my Zune's battery by putting it on the amp, and to increase the overall sound quality. In addition to the Zune I recently bought a pair of entry level Westone UM1 earphones which are well worth the $120 I paid for them.There was not a lot of amplification from the Boostaroo that the Zune didn't have already - it just didn't add alot of power.Worse, there is a constant hiss from the pretty low quality circuitry of the Boostaroo. It did nothing to increase the sound quality through amplification and made it worse when listening to something like classical or jazz by adding that annoying hiss.I'll be returning the Boostaroo (bought it from Radio Shack) and looking at other options."
4,fine for what it is,"I disagree with most of what everyone here is saying. The book included a wide variety of stories and articles on MANY various subjects. There were liberal and conservative view points addressed from all sorts of different people with different ways of life or thinking. Overall a good book for the college writing class. I do agree with one thing though. It is overpriced, as is normal with most text books!"
3,fairly good college textbook,"this book was definately easy for me, transitioning from HS to college was scary but books like this make the college experience easier. Basically a large compilation of essays, with review questions. Its a good book.The book i bought on amazon was in good condition for being used."
1,No Way WGP Made this Gun!,"It sucks! After the first, and light use, im already encountering trigger, barrel and velocity problems. I am very dissapointed at how this thing works out of the box. It seems the only way to make this a decent gun is to change EVERY stock component, which is atleast another 100-200$ in upgrades! I should have just bought a 300 dollor gun to begin with."
2,cheap...,"the bottom is removable, which I didn't know when I bought it. The pan feels very thin and flimsy."
5,Alessandra is Great!!,I Love this album! Alessandra has a great voice. She's also a terrific actress. I have nothing but the deepest respect for her.
2,Disappointed,"The assembly instructions must have been translated from another language because they did not make sense. I was still able to get the unit put together. It is much bigger than we thought. When on the table top, we could not feel any heat while sitting in our chairs. We moved the heater to the ground and then felt the heat. For the price, we decided it wasn't a big deal to put the heater on the ground next to the table. Unfortunately, the 1 lb propane tank only lasted about 20 minutes. We bought a second propane tank and the starter failed on the unit and could not get it lit again. I am in the process of returning it."
1,Dis-satisfied,"I ordered this thinking I would receive a collection of very good British mysteries--my passion! But when it came, I was quite disappointed. There are, perhaps, one or two short stories that I enjoyed, but most of them were very unsatisfactory, in my opinion. I consider it a ""give-to-the-thrift-store"" purchase. Save your money!!"
3,I've seen an original copy!,"I have seen an original copy of this book an from what I have seen regarding the Amazon color copy, I am afraid the person should have used a better printed copy to start with. I realize this book is rare but maybe someone out there who has an original they could do us all a favor and have a legitimate copy made.From my research there were only 300-500 copies of this produced and they were handmade by the author! These books range in price from $800.00 and up.If you are so lucky to have one of these beautiful originals, think about reproducing it for us."
2,Pactiv/E Z Foil 88006A Burner Bib For Electric Stove,"Not worth the money, and not even worth returning. I will stick to wrapping my burner plates with aluminum foil."
2,Not the Greatest,"While watching the move I thought to myself, ""I have to get this soundtrack!"" While listening to the soundtrack I thought to myself, ""Eh, should have waited."" Avril's ""Falling Down"" is the best song on this CD, followed by Shannon McNally's ""Now That I Know."" Other than that ... eh."
2,Crooked,I didn't really care for this movie. I purchased it without ever seeing it before. I like Gary Busey as an actor.
3,"Low Volume Level, Otherwise Classic Fun","I bought this collection for my father and was delighted with the visual quality. The soundtracks of all the films are at an unusually low volume level throughout however, compared to all other DVDs I own. As long as you can crank up the volume, you'll enjoy these."
2,Clash of the Comic Titans,"The legendary teaming of W.C. Fields and Mae West has some hilarious moments, but does not make for classic cinema. ""My Little Chickadee"" (1940) is an unsuccessful patchwork of two comedic styles that simply do not mesh. In fact, the Western satire works best when the stars keep their distance by doing their own thing. Not surprisingly, the film was more successful for Fields than for Miss West - who detested the Great Man until the day she died. Worth seeing for historical purposes.OVERALL RATING: **"
4,brassy fun,much fun for those who remember her. Better to give to the younger film fans in order to show the character of her work over these years
1,Very Bad Quality,"I was very much looking forward to this collection. Unfortunately I made the mistake of not checking it out until the Amazon 30 return policy was up so it is unreturnable. Every picture stops about half way through and won't play any more. I wasn't expecting any great quality but I was at least expecting to be able to finish the movies once they started. Don't buy this collection. If you do then don't make the mistake I did. Watch it before the return policy date is up in case the movies freeze up half way through like mine did. If I could give it 0 stars I would because it was a complete waste of my time and money and I feel very ripped off but Amazon forces you to give it at leat 1 star to register the review. I would even be happy if they let me exchange it and try another copy but I waited too long. I'll know better next time. Also it will be the last ""Glamour Collection"" I'll ever buy."
3,A SLEAZOID PACKAGE - SHAME ON THOSE MORONS !,"A missed opportunity. Stupidly formulated and cheaply realized. Shame on the oafs who threw this package together. An oppertunity missed. The films themselves are terrific - The transfers, nothing to write home about, adequate - but the presentation SUCKS! Stupid packaging adds to the rotten package - And what's the blank side all about? Universal should fire the morons who f**ed a legend!"
3,"A good start, but lets see the real gems","Most of this collection is from Fields later work, not bad, but are not as funny as the movies he made when he wasnt as ""famous""My favorites are: ""The Old Fashioned Way"", ""Poppy"", ""Tillie and Gus"", ""Million Dollar Legs"" , ""Man on a Flying Trapeze"" -- these earlier works are killer classics, with Fields at his funniest.I have been a fan of WCF since I was 12, at least we are starting to see something on DVD, lets hope the next set includes some of his greatest works.""How could you hurt a watch by dipping it in molasses?"" - WCF in the old fashioned way after baby Leroy dunks his pocket watch."
3,Half a Classic,"Although she shared screenplay credit with W.C. Fields, Mae West claimed to have written 90% of this screenplay herself... which is likely since Fields' role is so subservient and unattractive. He's put in the demeaning position of wanting to consummate their marriage when she finds him repulsive. Like the rest of this movie, it's not a very funny situation, but somehow he manages to wring some humor out of it (peeking through her keyhole, he mutters ""what won't they think of next?""). Ironically, it's his muttered asides that make this movie memorable, and in one scene -- as he struggles to put a wedding ring on her finger -- his antics actually cause West to laugh out loud... maybe the only spontaneous moment in her long career."
5,The young guns - a great read!,"I tremendously enjoyed reading about the young players that are ready to challenge just about everyone on the PGA tour! I read the book yesterday , just before watching Duval battle it out w/ Tom Lehman- with the other guys just behind him- TIGER, and Leonard! This is a great , fun book to check out!"
4,A superior course to fluency in Chinese,"The Integrated Chinese series is an excellent textbook. When combined with the audio lessons and practical application, it becomes a full college level course in language learning. The series combines a balanced amount of new vocabulary and grammar patterns. Plenty of examples and dialogues are used to illustrate the use of new vocabulary and grammar. At level 2, the book integrates the traditional and simplified Chinese characters as well."
5,"Wayne Gretzky is truely the ""GREAT ONE""",This biograph of Wayne Gretzky's career will leave you with goose bumps all over!!!!
4,Great sleeve,"This is a great sleeve for a laptop. just bought an Asus K52J on [...] that was a 15.6.. i was worried that it might not fit, but it fit beautifully. i don't however liked how the manufacturer stabled holes in front of the sleeve just to show a sample of what was inside the sleeve which was the neoprene."
4,Great laptop sleeve,I carry my laptop (15.4 inch screen Compaq) out of the office from time to time and I wanted something that would better protect it. This laptop sleeve fits perfectly and does that job. Only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish they had made it so that it has room inside or perhaps in an outside side pocket for the power cord and a wireless mouse. All things considered I am happy with it.
1,Very disappointed,"I looked at the dimensions of this Sleeve prior to ordering it, and thought it would be the perfect fit for my Dell Studio 1555. However, the moment I received it, I realised that this Sleeve was too small for my notebook. Despite my initial reservations, I proceeded to try and fit the Laptop in. Though I was able to force it in, it would be next to impossible to zip it up. The Sleeve itself is of a high quality, and for that I would give 5 stars, and may go ahead and order the 17""....but I dunno, may just be disappointed again."
4,More like a bag than a sleeve,"This is the perfect sleeve for a 14"" laptop. It easily fits the power cord and a mouse. It has enough padding that you aren't afraid that your computer will be damaged."
2,"Arrived broken, but you can get a glimpse of the quality.","Looks incredibly brittle. Either that, or this was the result of a high speed impact to the packaging. I suspect these are broken in the warehouse before they are even being packaged."
5,exceeded my expectations,"I've never used a whetstone before so I really can't compare it to any others. However, it did put an extremely sharp edge on some inexpensive chisels that I own. When I say extremely sharp I mean mirror finish, sharper than anything I've ever used before. It does seem to wear quickly but from what I understand that's normal with any whetstone. I don't think lapping it will be too difficult/time consuming. Even if it is it's worth the extra effort for the results I get with this stone compared to an oil stone."
4,Does the work,"The product works great... with wet surface creates that nice ""schmeer"" as supposed to be. I have still to hone in my technique but gave a very fine sharpening. It does it up the stone, but that's ok for my home use and 12 or so knifes. I like the whole ""ritual"" anyway. Only con, it should come with a base for that price point."
2,After the Kiss,"I bought this book not on Amazon. I had to make myself finish the book, only cause I don't like to have books around I didn't finish. I had also hoped it would get better. The story just did not pull me in.the romance was ok, the story was just ok. I just don't know what it was about the book but I did not like it overall."
3,Not that compelling,"That was my first book of Karen Ranny. I found it quite interesting but not very absorbing or a must-read book. I bought the book because I want to get to know the writing styles of as many romance authors as possible and while I didn't find it very compelling I didn't regret reading it. Read the lowesting ratings first, i.e., combine the reviews of the reader from AUSTIN, TX USA and the one from WEST HILLS, CA, you will get an overall and objective picture of the book."
5,Natural Strategies for Cancer Patients Review,"I bought this book because I was diagnosed with breast cancer in August 2010 and am now going through chemo therapy. This book has been very helpful in all aspects. It explains how cancer works/spreads, the high importance of nutrition, vitamins, and much more. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that has been diagnosed with cancer. I wish all the doctors you have to deal with during this tough time would take a more holistic approach, know/care about what each other is providing for their patient, and recommend books like this one. Most of the time it seems like they only care about their portion of your care and many times physicians advice can contradict one another. This book was very valuable in helping me to make educated decisions on my care both from doctors and myself."
4,Paul van dyk shines his progressive style,"Paul van dyke releases another tasteful album with his cool, seasoned, and proffesional approach. It is seen so much in his other works. This is another cd that makes that point. The huge trance fan that i am makes is hard to justfully judge this cd without comparing it to those other cd i listen to. This cd is great, but doesn't stand out as a cd that numbs me or makes me swear by. It does indeed deserve it's four stars."
5,Excellent Mix By PVD,"This is probably his Best album, the 2nd trance album I have heard, and is number 2 on my best list, only topped by Oakenfold's tranceport, though I highly recommend both albums :)"
3,"Out there, but not Back for PVD","Paul van Dyk's latest CD delves into the world of progressive trance with a light and familiar touch. Yet, as the tracks progress, Van Dyk seems to lose some of the soft melodic touch that propelled his 'Seven Ways' into trance stardom. Many have sighted the tracks ""Avenue"" and ""Face to Face"" as evidence of Van Dyk's continued dominance. While it's true that these tracks are exceptional, they are surrounded by such confounding and uneven tracks (such as ""Vega"" and ""Pikes""), that the CD as a whole lacks balance. The second disc provides some relief with ""Tell Me Why"", but also falls short of the standard set by Seven Ways. All in all, this Cd shows a vastly different, and not necessarily better side to Van Dyk's spinning talents."
4,Nice trance chill-out and warmer in tone than former cds,"The album starts on a somewhat housy note but then quickly progresses into trance territory with the singles ""avenue"", ""another way"" and ""tell me why"". Besides these, there are more arm-raisers here, but also very warm and charming melodies like ""together we will conquer"" that put your heart and soul at ease.Not a complex, demanding album, and not as danceable as ""vorsprung dyk technik"", but a very relaxing and somewhat warm experience. Great for the after-rave chill-out party at your house or just a cosy dreamy soundscape on a lazy relaxed evening."
5,"my profesor wrote this book, and he is smart","jeffery, its me scott sandland from your theology class. i just want you to know that i did read your book and enjoyed it. ironically, i brought from it some of the same things from your book as i did from Bertrand Russel, in that, it is not the formal religion that is important in christianity, but the act of koinonia and worship of God that is important. Too many people today are caught up in differences between each denomination, instead of focusing on what is truely the crux of the matter: Christ and His love."
2,"good story, but melodramtic and confusing at times","The story seems interesting, however I found the story hard to follow. Dialogue is long like that of older fantastical fiction. It is long and there is little to find in the speach patterns to seperate characters. The book also lacks good character descriptions within the text. In order to understand the book, I figure you really have to study the appendixes first and then read the dialogue very carefully. This typically is not the type of reading I enjoy for leisure.Unlike Tolkien, Synder spends very little time describing the settings. Actions at many times seem melodramatic and some scenes seem to contradict themselves."
3,Niamh and the Hermit,"The story was interesting and the plot well done. My only complaint is that I wish it was easier to follow. I bought the book to read for fun. Sometimes I felt like I had to study the book to understand what was going on. The dialogue was long and written in a style that required a lot of words with little meaning. I would have to stop and think about what was being said to get the point of the dialogue. There is very little setting description and the author moves between characters with little explanation. I wish it had been written more in a modern style to allow the characters and story to flow easier. It would have truly been an engaging book, one that I probably would have finished in one sitting."
3,Had to send it back.,"The company that I ordered this through only had 1 in stock. Prompt shipment, however, the kettle developed a leak in the base of the unit after 2 days. After another 8 hours, a new leak developed. It does heat rapidly!I shipped it back, still waiting for a refund."
3,Puzzling,"I'm not a Tahiti 80 fan. The voice is a bit too lilting for me. Still, they have some catchy tunes. The reason to get the Japanese import is for bonus songs 'John Steed' and 'So You Want to be a Rock n Roll Star', one of the best songs on the album in my uninformed opinion. The import price on Amazon right now is the same as the stateside version."
5,"Is there an ""alternate pop"" genre?","I really like this album. These are spirit lifting, ""alt. pop"" songs and they are a lot of fun. ""Heartbeat"" is a very fun and catchy song, and is the most popular on the album. Buy it, you will love it."
3,so so,it is too short and basic. does not teach how to swing. it shows only that kid can learn golf.
4,Dancing with Cats,"A pristine paperback copy of this extraordinary book. If cats are your thing, then this is a book for your shelf"
5,"Delightful photos, great gift","This is a delightful, whimsical series of photos of people in various dancing stances, matched by cats in similar stances. The people, in many cases clothed in outrageous costumes, are in poses that are as startling as those of the cats who leap and cavort around them.Wonderful as a gift for the person who has everything."
1,Not Too Good,The candy was stuck to the wrapper as if it had been exposed to heat and then re-solidified. Taste wasn't all that good either.
3,product received in fair condition,"The product was received (blu ray)in a timely manner. However, the blu ray cover appeared slightly worn. I ordered a brand new blu ray, but it had more of a ""used"" appearance to it."
2,What happened?,Where did Saint Etienne go? The up-beat 60's pop of Good Humor is nowhere to be found. The beats that drive their other albums have vanished into thin air. Clever lyrics no longer seem to suit them. Perhaps they've grown tired of thier youth. How sad.
2,"Bland, a disappointment","I was under the impression that, to be termed ""pop"", there had to be lyrics. This album simply has too much instrumental experimentation (some might term it texture) for my taste. And though Sarah's voice is lovely, a little emotion would be welcome. Note to an earlier reviewer: if you have to hunt for the ""hooks"", they're not hooks--and there are almost none to be had here. Better to check out other albums, perhaps So Tough or Good Humor."
2,"Should I buy ""Good Humour""?","Recently, I bought Saint Etienne's 1993 offering ""So Tough"". I thought the album quite good. One grouse though was that the sound quality of the CD was not good. Furthermore, a found the snippets of movie extracts irritating. Now, I experimented with the latest SE album. Let me ask you--are you willing to fork out about twenty dollars just to hear 1 or 2 good songs? Because this album is what it is worth--just 1 or 2 good songs. Sarah's voice has lost her angelic, lifting qualities. Here, it is more jazzy. If u expect some up-tempo songs, you will be disappointed. I thought this new album would convert me into a fan. Now I'm wondering if I should buy their 1998 ""Good Humour""."
1,Buyer beware!,"This is a great story, for the most part, by an excellent author. Problem is that there was a glitch in assembly and the middle of the book is from Fever, 1793. So Amazon replaced my book and the replacement was also faulty. They are pulling the copies they have so this won't happen again. I ended up buying a copy of Fever because the part I read in the middle of Turnabout was so good! Anything by Margaret Haddix Peterson is excellent! She often deals with time and that's one of my favorite topics."
5,Love it!,"I got this 3D mouse specifically to use with Autodesk Inventor and Solidworks and it works great with both of them. Not only that, now that I'm used to navigating with it - I struggle whenever I don't have it, it is 100% more intuitive than the native navigation you have to battle with your 2D mouse. For anybody doing much 3D CAD work, you gotta get one!I'm impressed with the quality look and feel of the unit and how well it stays put even when you pull vertically up on it. It took me about 10 minutes to get the drivers installed and the ""feel"" configured to my liking in both apps. Highly recommend this unit!"
2,Nice device but broke easily,"Ordered this device last December, but since I am from outside the US, just got hold of it by February (Not the fault of seller). Anyway, played around with it, worked as expected, built was just right, but after 2 weeks, it suddenly stopped and would not work anymore. Nothing happened to it, it just stopped.Called up seller but seller said it was out of warranty, so I ended up with good looking paperweight.Would want to have given this a better mark if it lasted more than 2 weeks."
4,3d Connexion,Bought one of these since it was the cheapest way to try out the concept.I have had it on my desk for a few weeks but really havent given it a full tryout - I use the mouse out of habit. It is heavy but when I pull up on it can still lift off the desk. Obviously the version with the heavy base wouldnt do this but I didnt want to spend that much money to try it out.Seems like a well constructed unit with good drivers so far - have used on both Solidworks 07 and 09
4,wishing for better ergonomics,"I am really grateful that 3Dconnexion finally came down on price point, but the fact is that it takes a while to get used to this one. You have to learn how to be gentle because if you don't then it will just be moving around your desk all day and you constantly have to remember where your hand is on the ball because it is a circle.That said it works just as well as any other spaceball, I'm just constantly reminded that I didn't spend the money for the better one."
4,Awesome little brother.,"This is an awesome little brother to the larger navigator which offers more features like programmable buttons, even know this has two buttons on it. Very smooth when 3D modeling, easy to use & setup."
3,MORONi,"This is an older book and is worth a read if you have an interest in psychotic, charismatic charlatans who like to seduce many women and commit murder in the name of their god. This book was similar in many ways toA Twisted Faith: A Minister's Obsession and the Murder That Destroyed a Church. The writing and research here is impeccable but the Mormon faith just drives me nuts and I hated reading about it in such great detail. It is so sad that three children were murdered IN COLD BLOOD and it is sad that his wife Alice was such a clueless moron. Reading about people that are so easily manipulated is disheartening. I think TC fans should read it though to broaden their horizons."
5,Love happens when you have the courage to love yourself.,"This is another of Ms. Gerard's magic stories. Both of the characters are very good people who are harder on themselves than anyone else could ever be. They are both very compassionate responsible people who need to step back and forgive themselves. Their love and yearning for each other pushes them to reach out to the other party with an unselfish need to help and heal that person. They can not stand to see each other in pain and can not stop trying to help. Their reward is mutual healing that leads to a deep and abiding love that will give them the fresh new future they never dared hope for, one that is full of all life has to offer."
5,Jesus Rules.,I love Jesus. Mark Driscoll helps me love Jesus more. Nothin' but love here. That about sums it up for me.
4,Good Questions and Answers About Jesus,"Driscoll and Breashears do a fine job with Vintage Jesus, answering so of the most pressing questions about Christ for the benefit of readers who may be seeking to understand more about Jesus. This book would be appropriate for believers and non-believers, as it is written in an interesting style and does not shy away from tough questions about the person and work of Christ. Of particular help are the q & a sections at the conclusion of each chapter. These sections provide a good review of the subject of each chapter while probing some new ground in a constructive way. Driscoll is a controversial figure within evangelicalism, but I think for his purposes here, he has written an excellent book which will help many people know Jesus better."
1,Poor case for a touch screen device,"The case appears in the photos as if the touch pad area of the device is left exposed in order to protect the rest of the device, but leave the screen accessable for the stylus and touch pad functions. But when I received the product, the case covers the entire device. The only things accessible are the top, bottom, and lower section of the front in order to use the buttons. But in order to use the stylus and the touch pad, you have to open the front of the case, which is not easy to do. You have to pry it open and almost break it doing so.Also, with the case on, the device will not fit on to any base station charger, even with the multiple model adapters that come with the base station. You can only sync and charge the device using a separare charge cable, not the base station itself.This product pretty much locks out any functionality of the device all in the name of protection. It was a waste of money and time."
5,Redefine yourself,"What a great CD. Careful not to pigeon hole these guys as Celtic only (I love Celtic too). Though the Irish overtones are there, they are tastefully melded with the likes of Dylan, Dave Matthews, & Tom Petty among others, into a unique blend that is it's very own. I bought the disc after hearing them play live, opening for Tull. As Tull slowly morphed into the Ian Anderson show, I found myself at the CD tent buying ""Red"". I popped into the CD player once in the car and it stayed there for weeks. Energy, musicianship, humor, maturity - its all here folks. It will get your feet to moving. I listen to it at least once a week."
1,A book with an indentity crisis.,"Even as a complete newbie to making glass beads, this book left me cold. I don't quite know who it's target audience is meant to be - people who make glass beads? or people who string them?Either way, it fails miserably. The cover promises that the artists inside will share inspiration and methods. There is precious little of the latter that I can see.The photography is dissapointing - many images are grainy or reproduced too small to be of any use. Each project featured shows you a photo and an illustration of the finished jewellery (usually necklaces) - but doesn't tell you how the beads are made or even anything much about stringing them, other than a list of what spacer beads the maker used.With such a promising front cover - this book was a dissapointment. This is no disrespect to the artists featured, just the book seemed to have no purpose and no real information to impart to the reader other than the feelings each artist has about their work."
5,Fantastic book!,"I highly recommend this book. The format is clear and simple to follow. Even the novice can string like a pro with the full page illustrations the author has provided. I've just begun flameworking and I found the book to be indispensable, there are a wealth of ideas in this book that are sure to inspire beaders, both new and experienced.It's definitely on my gift giving list this year."
1,Little to Offer that Can't Be Found Elsewhere,"This book is definitely not for lampworkers, as it contains no information on technique. Even in terms of eye candy, it's lacking -- most of the beads shown are the common dot and line designs you see from relatively new lampworkers [...] every day.I wouldn't say it has much for those who make beaded jewelry, either -- just the same kinds of projects and styles you see in the bead magazines every month. [...] it's not worth the money.It gets one star from me, but only because that's the least I can give."
3,Very Nice But Not As Described,"I really like this pan. However, no where on the pan or box was it stated that is was the 18/10 stainless steel. My other pans have this stamp on the bottom stating that they are the top quality stainless. My niece purchased this pan at a store and it is stamped with the 18/10 stainless steel stamp. SO I just wonder especially since it took on a slight color change after the first use. I DO like this pan and use it weekly. I have also purchased another one for a future bride."
2,Things stick in it..........,Overall I prefer non stick cookware. I've tried 3 pieces of the cuisinart stainless. Foods stick to the surface and harder to clean.
2,Think they changed the name...,"Cuisinart has two different grades of cookware. I've bought a couple of sets and seven or eight seperate pieces of what used to be called Chef's Classic over the last five or six years, and I love it!. One time I mistakenly ordered a set of the cheaper lighter weight pans. I quickly returned the set. That is what this pan is. I ordered it, and I'll keep it, but it's far inferior to what I already have. This is not nearly as well made. I see they now have a MultiClad Pro line... Seems as if they changed the names."
2,"cuisinart 12"" clasic stainless everyday pan with lid","I bought this pan because my 12"" pan needed to be replaced and in hopes that it would be as good and match my Faber-ware and Food Network stainless steel pans; I am disappointed. The pan is only washed by hand and heat setting is med to med-hi, how ever the pan is showing black pitting spots on the lid and pan. The pan is not made with quality stainless steel to show tarnishing in only a few weeks and four times being used. I have owned my Faber-ware for more than 8 years and it is still in great shape and it was washed in the dishwasher a few times. I won't buy this product again, it is not a good quality pan. I am very disappointed."
5,Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless - Functional and Durable,"I purchased the 10 inch open skillet, 6 - quart sauce pot, 12 inch every day pan, and 3 quart chef's pan from the Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless line. I believe that these are about all the pans you really need for a typical kitchen, along with perhaps a smaller pot and a small non-stick pan for eggs.I have been using these pots and pans for a few months, and I am enjoying using them. Not to mention that you can't beat the price for this kind of quality cookware. I feel that these pans will last for a very long time."
5,Best roaster around,This wonderful pan with the dome lid works great for roasting a whole chicken that has been cut in half. Just cut one side of the chicken and place flat side down in pan and cover. Makes a wonderful dinner !
5,cuisinart chefs pan,"very happy with the pan just what i was looking for . the food tastes better, cooking in this pot"
3,"cheap, borring kitcheb set.","Well, for starters this kitchen set took me well over an hour n a half to cut out every single piece and then put all the little pieces together! The kitchen came in about 599 little pieces that were all stuck together. Each handle to every door handle had to be put in along with all doors water spouts walls floors counter ect. Once u finally figure out what tiny piece goes where it looks ok. There isn't much color to any of the utensils. They are all a dingy grey, or black. and there are 2 if each. I like the blue counter tops with the tan walls an all, but this could have been so much better!."
1,"Another ""You Get What You Pay For"" item.",There was a ton of hard plastic pieces to snap off. It took a couple of hours to assemble and when it was finished it looked cheap. It's so light my 3yr old granddaughter can pick it up. It's pretty small and probably won't last her another year. I'm hoping to go out and buy a replacement when the after Christmas sales are on.
3,"daughter loves, but definately a challenge to build","My daughter adores her kitchen and plays with it endlessly, which makes it worth my time, however it took me approximately 4 hours on Christmas Eve to put this kithcen together, and let me say I was non too thrilled by the difficulty of the assembly. And although it comes with some rudamentary dishes, I bought her a much better set to go with her kitchen as the sharp edges from the plasic frame were very challenging to smooth and make me nervous on the dishes, the edges were easier to get rid of on the kitchen parts themselves. Like I said, my daughter loves her kitchen, so it makes it worth the challenge of building, but quite frankly had I known how hard it would be to put together, I probably would have bought a differnt one."
3,Better pack a lunch!,"This toy, as a finished product, is ok and my 22 month old likes to play with it. But, it took my father the better part of the weekend to put it together and that was with various helping segments from me, my husband, and my mother. The only one who didn't join in on the assembly fun with my daughter. The instructions are HORRIBLE, with no wording, just pictures. In addition, the package was short some of the shorter screws, which we had to purchase. For removing the parts from their frames, I used a utility knife, so that there were no sharp edges. The finished product seems sturdy, and my daughter loves to make the burners light up and make their sound. I also purchased this from walmart.com for $34.00 with free ship to store, so I can't complain too much. If I had paid the 80 something dollars, I would have been irate!"
1,Loooow Quality,"Some relatives bought this kitchen for my son for Christmas 2006. The husband put it together and it took him 5 or 6 hours. He said it was horrible to put together. A week after Christmas one of the handles fell off. The doors don't fit well. We had to duct tape the microwave in place. The sink falls out constantly. My son has enjoyed playing with it. We take it out of circulation every once in a while, so it hasn't been played with constantly for the last year. It actually was in the basement for about 6 months. It's not going to hold up much longer. For a little bit more money you can get something that you can pass on, or re-sell when your child outgrows it instead of tossing in the trash. Which this thing will probably last a few more months. It really is cheaply made. Very low quality."
1,Big Disappointment!,"While the set looks cute, overall it is a very poorly made set. I bought it for my 1 year old for Christmas and will have to replace it. There are so many jagged plastic edges after it is put together that it isn't even safe. I love that there are so many doors and such to open but one has to pull so hard to do so it is almost impossible for a child. I am writing this review to hopefully inform others that you are better off spending the money for a quality kitchen."
3,It's good for the price,"Yes, yes, it takes 2 hours to assemble. My only real dislike is that the doors, especially on the little microwave are very hard to open. My son is almost 3, and he has to pull VERY hard to get them open. Also, when he pulls them open, the kitchen is a little unstable and several times has tipped forward a bit. I am sure it will fall over on him at least once - but it's very lightweight. Anyway, he's playing with it right now and having a ball - so, it can't be all that bad!"
1,SOULD BE PULLED OFF MARKET,"what a mess!!! i was assured it would be ""easy to assemble"". when i saw all the pieces attached to sheets of plastic [remember getting scratched from those sharp plastic nubs when assemblying model airplanes--well, this is 100x harder] i boxed it up and returned it immediately. little tikes and fisher price have my vote and my money$$."
3,American Plastic Toy Homestyle Kitchen,"it wasn't to difficult to put together, very dirty when we received it the box was all but almost open, the plastic had to be wiped down thoroughly because on the toy was some sort of black oil smudges. the sinks spout attachment doesn't hook into anything at all it can come out and be lost. every plastic part was on a larger plastic frame that had to be ripped apart from and it left very sharp and dangerous edges so if you do purchase this i would suggest using a razor to try to slice down the jagged pieces. if you are not careful some of the parts needed for assembly look like trash and can be accidentally tossed out so watch out!"
5,saint etienne at their best!,This import is a compilation of some of the best S.E. stuff their is ! If you enjoy it you should invest in their first album Foxbase Alpha. This comp is from alot of EP's that are often hard to get. Other Saint Etienne like bands are Cola Boy and Oval........Enjoy!!!!
4,Raise the roof and say Amen!,"I'm happy that Mike Farris loves the lord and isn't afraid to tell anyone. Matter of fact, it sounds like he found Jesus sitting in a bar in the New Orleans French Quarter sucking on a hurricane.Wow, what a marvelously dirty, funky, testament. Very highly recommended"
1,A painfully awful outing.,"I'm a huge, huge fan of the original Trancers. The rest of the series-- not so much. But at least every outing till now had featured original footage of B-Movie king Tim Thomerson. Trancers 6 has the dubious honor of being the first in the series to use stock footage of Thomerson; basically, Sir B-Movie wanted nothing to do with the project. And I don't blame him; Trancers 6 is edges into the realm of C-Movie. The plot makes little to no sense, the dialogue is forced in principle and acted even worse, and the effects are simply laughable. The old B-Movie style effects from the original Trancers had a certain charm to them, perhaps because they didn't try to do too much. Trancers 6 feels like it was made by an overeager college wannabe that just got his first Avid in the mail. It's truly painful to watch. I didn't get through it in the first round through. Really, Trancers 6 has no redeeming qualities. 1/5 stars."
3,Mixed results.,"Not sure what the issue is, but I have it hanging off my AirportExtreme. I planned to put all my USB devices on it to make them accessible to the entire network. Works fine for SD card reader, OfficeJet Printer and External Hard Disk, but does not work with some USB flash drives, my compact flash reader or Canon camera. That was disappointing and mysterious. Other than that I really like the unit. Has been reliable for the devices that work on it. Stand is likely not usable. I laid it flat."
2,Over half the ports stopped working after only 15 months,"I purchased the 7-Port Hi-Speed Hub from IOGEAR (GU227) in January of 2011. After a mere 15 months, the top two extra ports on the front side, and the top two ports on the back side of the unit stopped working. This effectively renders the unit a 3 port unit. So far, those still work. So if you're OK with having a temporary 7-port hub that renders itself a 3-port, buy this item. Otherwise, look elsewhere. I'm pretty disappointed that it stopped working after such a small amount of use (I don't even use all the ports all the time).It comes packaged with a 3 year warranty, but silly me, I threw away the receipt after about a year, so no go on the warranty. Maybe if I'd been mindful in retaining the receipt, IOGEAR could have proved themselves reliable in replacing the unit, but as it stands, don't expect their stuff to last."
3,Did not work for me,"Perhaps the only true purpose of this tape is to hold together pieces of wall-to wall-carpeting. I wanted to secure two mats together, side by side. The glue was not tough enough to do that and the mats walked in opposite directions despite the tape (and yes, I did try reversing one). I would have been surprised but thrilled if it had worked. It was worth a shot."
3,Return policy,"I did not keep the item I ordered. It was everything it was advertised as but it did not suit my intended purpose. I did however want to thank Amazon for their easy return policy. It was easy, the labels were easy to access and I had no trouble in returning the item. Minus the shipping charge to return it, getting credit for the returned item was simplified and quick. I use Amazon alot and will continue to do so."
4,only four episodes???,"a MUST HAVE for Raven fans! the bad news is, the dvd has only four episodes and no bloopers. the good news is, its the FUNNIEST show out there as of 2004 December! Raven is so funny! she's one HOT girl too! The other so called comedies of today, either try too hard, or just over act. theres nothing funny about over acting; a reason why i never liked jim carey. This is a very funny show, that is not going to offend most. like me i get offended watching will and grace, sex in the city, etc. so i dont watch those. instead i watch Raven, who is a MAJOR BABE, and she is very funny. and the show is funny. and the show is not just about comedy but every episode has an actual plot and a climax.a MUST have for Raven fans!"
3,Raven for President,"I think raven would be a great president. Think how useful it would be for a president to be able to see into the future. She could see the result of any new laws coming out or if we would win a war or something. She would even be able to tell us whose gonna win the world series or the supabowl. It would be great to have a president who never got anything wrong and never made any bad laws.I don't care how gay and stupid Raven is because I think she is great and she can see into the future. I like Chelsey to, but Eddie creeps me out and I think he he is stupid. I think Corry should go on a diet, big time and I think he is stupid to.Raven for president!Raven for president!Raven for president!beep beep!beeeeeep!hee hee hee heeparp!"
1,Didn't even play.,"I bought this as a Christmas present for someone who loved That's So Raven. I chose to buy this one because it was rated as being ""very good"" quality, and I wanted to make sure that it would be good. upon arrival, I noticed that the case was cracked on the side and there appeared to be dog teeth marks on the wrapping. Not wanting to break the seal, and trusting that it would still at least play even if the outside wasn't the prettiest, I wrapped it and gave it as a gift anyway. When they opened it and tried to play it however, nothing happened, and the disc simply would not work. I would have thought that ""very good"" quality would have at least played. Not a good thing to find out that your Christmas present was a dud."
3,Its funny...for a kids show,"Ok, in response to the guy about Lizzie Mcquire. How can you say this show is not funny but then say Mcquire is? LOSER! Ok anyway, this shows humor can be really pothetic sometimes but when its entertaining its REALLY entertaining. It kind of gives you the same feeling as a child version of bernie mac...But Id have to say, save your money and go for mac"
1,Listen Up Folks - I'm so disappointed,Hello everyone.I bought this VCR after reading some positive reviews.I have owned it now since Sept. of 2005. In just less than three short months the VCR is playing terribly.I am in the tech field so I have read the manual and tried everything. Either the replay heads or the tracking is shot. On play back we have wavy lines that are so distracting we can't stand watching a tape.I am going to see if we can return this product. I will follow up on just how good customer service is.
1,This VCR is a menace!!!,"This is the worst VCR I have ever purchased. Withing the first week, it has eaten 2 videos and almost a third. I am returning it after less than a week. I just wish I could be reimbursed for the tapes I lost. What a piece of junk!!!"
3,ehh....,"honestly this album sounded really average to me. I listened through the whole thing a couple of times and though I cannot find a song I really hate I also cannot find one I really love. Reviewer Tracy is right if you want to check out some really good emo stuff checkout: Christie Front Drive, American Football, or Copeland."
1,ugh,this is cookie-cutter emo. i can't believe all the raves this has been getting. don't you have to be over 13 to review an album on amazon? the music itself is relatively inoffensive - it's nothing new but at least it doesn't suck. then there's the lead singer who makes you want to slap him for whining so much.if you've graduated high school you should not own this album.
4,cleverly written,"This little book was for my four young grandchildren (ages 6 - 14). Since they will be visiting our nation's capital in a few days, it was especially meaningful for each of them.We had fun reading all of it together!P. Jenkins"
3,Its just okay,Some people should write some perform. A few can do both. This is an example of when you should stick to one craft.
2,What Is This?,"I don't know. This new album by Pharrell isn't anything to write home about. There are a few songs on here that I like, but I had to listen to them more than once just to like them. Seriously, ""In My Mind"" could have been so much better, but it fell short. The lyrics and the synthesized beats could have been better. More emotion and more melody would've been great. Other than that, I prefer hearing Pharrell sing than rap. Try again, Pharrell!"
5,empire strikes back $$$$$,"""ALL MY CAR DOORS, GO UP LIKE TRANFORMERS"" Pharrell WIllIams 2006NEED I SAY MORE GET YOUR MONEY UP DIPSET"
2,Disappointed,"I expected more from this release especially due to the fact the nice tracks were played on the radio but this album sucks. pharell makes hits for other artists, I don't understand why he can't make the wicked tracks for himself."
2,Here we go again....,"In my mind just does not have the lyrical wizardry to it that it needs. Some of the beats are good, but Pharrell is just not a rapper. Look at all the other CD's by the Neptunes, and you see a trend. Lryics are lakcluster, beats are lacking on some tracks, but has a few shining moments. Alas, we buy CD's for a good CD. Not a few good tracks.I guess this album sums it up...in Pharrell's Mind this is hot. However, in reality this CD does not cut it. Do not get me wrong, Pharell is an EXCELLENT PRODUCER. As an rap artist, not."
2,"Interesting, at best","This book provides interesting history lessons regarding lingual development, and is moreso a great glossary of references (for the full-time linguistics student) than a handbook for actors as it purports to be. It's hard to read what he writes when he ""spells"" accents, as many of his phonetic symbols rely more on a presumed knowledge of the accents than examples. I've been all over the world, too, and don't find any of the accents on his CD to be convincing for the people I've met and places I've been to. Perhaps his ""accents"" would be a good representation for the way radio anouncers and news casters who try to minimize accents speak. But that is all."
1,his accents don't sound right at all,"If you listen to the audio CDs, his accents are just plain horrible.My Vietnamese friend doesn't think the guy's Vietnamese accent sounds right at all, I (Arab) don't think his Arabic accent sounds at all Arab.0/5 stars"
5,great gift,I would recommend this to anyone wanting to learn various accents. My teen age daughter loved this and is already trying them out.
1,Way too much,"I have to use this book for an English class, and I do not like it. The structure of the book is very difficult to understand, and the samples of literature are not very good. I would recommend a book that is smaller, and easier to follow or to use as a reference. This book is essentially useless once it is not used for a class."
2,Fail On Dell Vostro 1700,"Dimensions specified are incorrect: the bag I received (and returned) is 17"" x 12"", not 18"" x 13"" as listed. The 17"" Dell Vostro will not fit, unless you like the idea of forcing the zippers closed around the corners of the laptop: that means there's zero cushioning at the corners, NOT why you (or I, at least) want a cushioned laptop sleeve. And that's with nothing ""extra"" poking out of the laptop shadow, no additional battery space, no dongle, nothing but the laptop itself, not a fit. Dimensions are NOT as advertised.Looks like it would be a good choice for a 16"" laptop, though.[Update: there's a tag attached to the Microsoft bag that describes the internal fit of the sleeve: I didn't make a note of the dimensions, but they were considerably smaller than the dimensions Amazon quotes. Other sites, such as Wal-Mart, list conflicting and inaccurate dimensions, too.]"
4,Laptop sleeve,"The quality of the product is good. The zipper works easily. However, it does not have a shoulder strap."
3,pretty good,Its a fun game if you love The Sims. There a few bad things about it though. The animals are not very bright. The pee on the carpet and no matter how many time you scold them for it they never learn. Plus they die if you don't feed them right away. Sometimes even when you do fill their food bowl when there hungry they just sit there like a big dummy and starve to death. The upside is you can bring them back to life. Overall its a fun game. But i still prefer The Sims on the computer.
1,Not Happy,"I ordered the game for my daughter on 11/28/06 quite confident that her big item wish was bought and I could forget about it. I never recieved it and was never informed by Amazon that it was returned as undeliverable. So on Christmas day when she opened her presents, she asked where it was. I told her I ordered it and we started looking about the house as to where it was. After going on the computer to the website I then found out that it was returned and my credit card had been reimbursed. Shame on them. I will not use them again. I believe they got too big for their britches and the customers are the ones paying the price."
1,Junk,Made in China junk will not stay in at all must hold in to heat up. Not worth my time or money to return.
4,Suprise Surprise!!,"This CD was a pleasant surprise. I was expecting a few good hits, but the entire album is good!!"
1,"""Hapless Half-Wits"", eh?","""Hapless Half-Wits"" is clearly what Sony thinks of the people who would be interested in buying this atrocity... only four shorts, two of them on DVD already, and -- yes -- they're colorized. (I know you can ""turn off the color"", but that's a small consolation for being asked to pay $25 for only 2 shorts you don't already own on DVD.)Sony is coming close to getting a ""Worst DVD Producer EVER"" award for these Stooges monstrosities."
4,Very good Colorization and restoration.,"I just rented this DVD and I'm very impressed with the restoration and colorization. I only noticed one place where the inside of shemp's mouth was a little purple. Not bad. In past colorizations, the inside of mouths were very noticibly purple. But even then, I prefered colorization.Colorization is great because it makes things clear and realistic. B&W; makes things unclear. Expressions are harder to see. Grey faces fade into the grey background. We see color in real life, so a color movie is realistic and easier to immerse ourselves in and suspend disbelief, making it more enjoyable.I have over 100 stooge shorts, but don't have two on this disk: Beer Barrel Polecats and I'll Never Heil Again. I plan on buying this because of those two, and also I want the colorized versions of the two I already have."
2,welsh malarkey,"A mildly interesting read; but don't expect sophistication or artwork of the Garth Ennis/Preacher variety; not cost effective in these terms. We would like more, but much thicker-- Anything from the UK is to be encouraged..."
4,Works Well,"I needed a USB hub with Firewire. This was the best price that I saw. So far I've been happy with it. It's a little unstable on its mounting plate so I had to ""wedge it in"". Also as someone else mentioned, all the ports apart from one USB and one firewire are at the back. Which as it happens is OK for me but maybe not for everyone."
1,Piece of Junk!,"As with almost any hub this equipment was easily installed and used until about 15 days into use when it just quit...I don't expect simple hubs to just quit, so I had thrown the receipt and packing materials out. I have since purchased a 4 port belkin and a 4 port CyberPower hub and they are both working flawlessly. I opted for the two hubs because I wanted the reliability of the Belkin after the experience with the I/O gear garbage, but knew I needed something other than the Belkin to charge my iphone from the hub."
5,Excellent change of pace,"I am always looking for a jazzy/r&b sound with maybe a little hip-hop thrown in. Some of my favorites are Meshell Ndegeocello, Floetry, Heather Headley, Sandra St. Victor, Jill Scott, Jazzyfatnasties, Boney James, Marcus Miller, the Roots, etc... Kemistry creates his own niche and fits right in there very nicely. Track 3 happens to be my favorite, with Tracks 1,2,&5 close runner-ups. The remaining tracks are very good as well. His voice is not common and the delivery is somewhat Al Jarreau-ish. The music is laid back and the lyrics full of love."
5,Best CD I've bought in as long as I can remember!!,"I can't stop playing it! If you like jazz, R&B or soul you need to hear this and buy it immediately! Incredible vocal range and a rythm you won't be able to turn off.Great debut album!"
5,OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!,"This CD is an absolute pleasure to listen to. KEM balances the mix of Jazz and R&B like an artful juggler, giving you just enough of each. I haven't stopped listening to this since I purchased it. I hate to compare an artist to others but since the comparison has been made several times in other reviews, I will. He does have an Al Jerrau flava, but much, much smoother. More like an Al Jerrau/Michael Franks blend.From start to finish KEM takes you there. Buy this CD!!!!!!'You will not be disappointed."
4,"Kudos, Brotha Kem!!!","Okay, stop and think for a moment... When was the last time that you heard a song emotionally powerful, that it made you pull to the side of the road??? That's what ""Love Calls"" did for me. The vocals - a mix of a lil' Will Downing, George Benson, & Carl Thomas... Imagine that! Coupled with a musical arrangement that stirs the soul...!I was sold - the rest of the album I also enjoyed - my only criticism is that it was often hard to distinquish one song from another - Peace.Moe & Gina"
4,Smooth Listening,When I first heard his single I fell in love with his voice. He has such a smooth and mellow sound ti reminds me of a rainy day. And he sounds just like Al Jarreau. I really enjoyed it.
4,RELAXING,"I love this CD. Literally speaking, it relaxes my mood and eases my mind each time I listen to it. Yes, he put you in the mind of Al,but today there are alot of artist that put you in the mind of someone you've heard before. You have to give Kem his props. The boy is bad(point blank). His lyrics are unbelievable. Oh my God, he put me in this mood where I just want to lay back and listen to what he has to tell me. I highly recommend Kemistry. It is a must have."
5,A Must-Buy Album,"I LOVE THIS ALBUM! I first became interested in KEM when I heard ""Can't Stop Loving You"", and I knew I had to get my hands on the CD. I also like ""Each Other"", a song about Kem's relationship with God, ""Heven"" and ""Without You"". Also, I did not have any problems with the CD. There were no skips--it played perfectly. Thanks."
3,i don't know,"there seems to be no shortage of dopplegangers out there today.let's see maxwell is the new marvin.ursher is the new mj.van hunt is the new curtis mayfield.anthony hamilton is the new bobby womack.donnie, rahsaan, glenn lewis and a list of others are the next stevie. if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then al jarreau and the rest of em must be flat as pancakes, but if you're gonna bite, you may as well bite from the best fruit.that said i wanted to dig this cd more than i do. it's all very smooth and nice and maybe that's the prob.this neo soul or whatever it's called these days is too close to smooth jazz (read:boring)or worse yet smooth pop.member the days when you heard horns, and strings, and chord changes and percussion breaks....what happened to all that?kem does a nice job of keeping the wine and cheese vibe going, but just once, i wish he'd throw some latin heat or break it down and let the band just go off for a minute. oh, well maybe next time."
3,It was what it claimed to be.,"It was smaller than I expected but that was my fault, not theirs. It clearly stated the size. It was what it claimed to be."
1,Hideously stupid comedy,"Big waste of time for all the talent involved here. Liv Tyler gives a very sexy performance in the best tradition of film noir goddesses as a double-crossing vixen who always gets her way. Paul Reiser, Matt Dillon and John Goodman are the seemingly innocent men who cross her path and fall instantly for her. The plot weaves and weaves like a spider spinning a very complicated web, convincing you that it will end up in a very clever and surprising way. However, a very violent and simplistic ending that seems to have been written by a grade-schooler is the outcome, leaving the audience angry for having been cheated into such an empty experience. It is, however, the first film I've ever seen to mention the inherent value of a DVD player. Michael Douglas (who also co-produced) absolutely steals the show as the hired hit man with a walking carpet on his head."
5,Not Dante's Inferno,"I didn't even realize I haven't reviewed this book when I reviewed the other three in the series. I think this was the best one, which is not something that can be said of most series. It was a great conclustion that wraped everything up so well. In many ways it doesn't have the perfect happy ending, but the ending is natural for this series. On the one hand, I wish there was more, on the other, this was the perfect ending."
4,One of those little books worth reading again.,"Quite a short book, but with lots of thumbnail sketches of little maneuvers in law cases. It's not as good as one might wish for ascertaining useful techniques of cross-examination, but it is a subtle book, pointing out things that might not be naturally noted when dealing with a hostile (or defensive) person. My interest in this book originated with my criminal-defense lawyer brother, but since I am a philosopher, I have to argue with hostile students everyday. Thus, I could use some useful pointers on fruitful and effective questioning. I get the feeling this is a little book that should be reviewed every once in a while as a review of effective questioning. Definitely worth the price, and an easy read too."
2,Costa Rica - A Traveler's Guide,I personally didn't CARE for this video. I wanted to see a more comprehensive view of places to stay while traveling in Costa Rica. It seemed to cater to the refined high end traveler vs family or adventure traveler.
3,Paris Hilton Goes To Costa Rica,"Paris Hilton Goes To Costa Rica....A rich American young girl giving you the tour of how she ""ruffs it"". Maybe this was a demo tape for her own reality show that did not sell?Anyway parts are good, good photography.........just missing SOOOOOOO much!"
2,Good and Bad,"Wow, what mixed reviews!! The BAD first: For a movie that was less than 60 minutes, it was too heavy on seeing the inside of a few posh resorts and the people who own them. Also, too much of the pretty host posing in her various bathing suits in front of her mirror, in the pool, by the falls, in the fountain, in the dining room, on the massage table, on a lounger......The GOOD: Some nice shots of the scenery as seen from the resorts, a quick glimpse of the volcano, a great boat ride mangrove tour, some quick glimpses of local towns from the car, a fishing trip, a cute sloth, a little shopping, dancing in nightclub, and nice waterfalls. I feel that I have to buy another video to see Costa Rica, the people, the land, the towns, and what to expect if I go there and can't afford the posh resort."
5,thalias hits wonderfully remixed,"hey, i have to say i love this cd. i am a big thalia fan, and i was a little skeptical buying this cd, but all my doubts were wrong. a quien le importa is amazing, amor a la mexicana is also good, but the best on the cd would definatly have to be mujer latina, AHHHH me encanta con todo de mi corazon! i definatly recomend this cd to todos"
3,This is NOT Tourist 2!,"If you're like me and thinking about buying this album looking for more of what you liked from Tourist, don't -- you will likely be disappointed (like I was). Definitely not as funky nor as memorable. Fine for having on in the background, but I doubt it's worth the asking price just for that. Giving it a 3 mostly because I still have warm feelings about St. Germain based on Tourist -- if you don't have that, get it!"
4,Cool,"I like St. Germain. When I first listened to this album, I thought it wasn't as good as Tourist. The sound is different in both albums, and I think this one may feel as good as the former one depending on your mood..."
1,So bad that it's funny.,"A well-meaning family friend once rented this movie for my family and his, and we dutifully watched it. What followed was the singularly worst movie any of us had ever seen. ""The Boy Who Loved Trolls"" has now become a running family joke and provided us with hours of entertainment from mocking it. Yes, it's low-budget Wonder Works, but that never bothered me before. There are several Wonder Works productions that I adored. It's the plot and script that really take you on a wild ride to terrible. So painful there are not even words."
1,Robbing the Grave,"This dvd is an attempt to make money on the death of Robin Harris. I thought this was a dvd about him. It starts out being a dvd about the comedy club and its owner. Afterward, it adds some clips of Robin's job as the emcee. It then turns into a series of interviews from people who knew him. I was thoroughly disappointed. Why would someone rob the public by using his name."
1,poor workmanship,"I returned two of these. The top portion is larger than the bottom and the quilting creates wrinkles & buckling that will not smooth out. You would expect a higher thread count for the money (felt like @ 180). Also, there was very little padding so you don't get what the pictures show."
5,I love my Laura Ashley Sophia items!,"I have had my Sophia comforter set for several years so far, and I never get tired of it. It is just gorgeous and gives an elegant feel to my blue bedroom. I have the valances at the windows, and the matching towels, accessories, and wallpaper border in my master bath, and they make a lovely, coordinated oasis in our house."
2,"Buy this for Winterfair Gifts, don't bother about the rest!","Like other reviewers, I bought this anthology for one story - Lois McMaster Bujold's 'Winterfair Gifts' - and I'd give that story on it's own 5 stars. I'm not sure it's particularly accessible for a reader unfamiliar with the Vorkosiverse, but for Miles devotees it was deeply satisfying. While I understand another reviewer's disappointment that Miles and Ekaterin were peripheral characters in this story which centres on Roic and Taura, I don't really share that disapointment. Ms Bujold is always a 'thinking' and intelligent writer - the Vorkosigan books are mainly written from Miles' point of view and it was most illuminating (and alternately hysterically funny and deeply touching)to see him through other eyes.I must confess that I'm more an SF/Fantasy reader than a romance reader, which is probably why I found most of the rest of the book pretty unreadable, but I don't begrudge a cent of the purchase price - the Bujold story was worth it."
4,Same old Francis - thank goodness,"When you've ploughed through some over-long, underwhelming piece of trash by a new writer, it sometimes pays off to play it safe. This you can cheerfully do with Dick Francis, whose novels are all the same, but all different. We always have the same hero. Sometimes he's a jockey, an ex-jockey, a struggling writer or a society misfit. But he's always male, straight-laced, dependable in a crisis, aged 20-30 and can ride a horse.Here we have a classic cocktail of Dick Francis. The details are irrelevant (it happens to concern a small racing village with murder afoot). The main point is the Francis once again delivers something beautifully written and well worth a few hours relaxation. A good bet? You bet."
3,Their manual says +or- 10..,"I thought I did all my due diligence and bought the right product, until I read the manual. Inside the manual says, reading can be +or-10. I still don't understand several other reputed websites says wrist based monitors are good and recommended. But the product manual itself says there could be variation. Anyway I returned it, now waiting for my 780 model."
5,This wrist monitor could save your life!,"This little wrist monitor with the small price works as well if not better than those larger, more expensive wrist & arm models. This thing could really save your life, since it gives accurate readings and could potentially alert you to problems such as high blood pressure and irregular heart beating (it did for me one week before the cardiologist and her heart holter worn for 24 hours did!). The storage allows me to store up to 60 (I think that's correct) readings, great for me because I have to chart my daily readings. It's easy to use...I use it at home, and at the office. Light and portable, easy, and perfect. I LOVE this thing, and it was so inexpensive!"
2,Not Worth It,"Most reviewers mention how they eagerly anticipated this CD, since there are so many great artists contributing. I also had high hopes for it, since a few of the artists are among my favorites. So I was actually shocked at how mediocre it is, and how even the contributions of my favorite musicians seemed dull and lifeless. It is as if they asked some of the greatest Christian bands to give them the worst song they ever recorded, and then put them all into a compilation. This CD is not worth your time or money. If you want a good mix of contemporary Christian artists, a WOW mix would be a better choice."
2,"One good song, the rest are dissapointing","The only song on this album that I have thoroughly enjoyed has been Shortstop by Steve Taylor. I enjoy the other groups (Jars of Clay, Michael Tait, Steven Curtis Chapman, Ginny Owens, PFR, Delirous, & Sixpence), but this album contains what I consider their worst songs so far. I did not enjoy this album considering what I payed for it. If you're looking for a good CCM Compilation CD, stick with the WOW CD's."
2,Whoop-de-do,"If you want to watch a movie that is good, watch ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" instead. The acting was good, but nothing to get excited about. Miss Jolie was fine in her role, but its nothing we haven't seen before. Sure she can say her lines fast without stuttering, but that doesn't mean it deserves an Oscar. This movie made me think hard about one thing: it made me think of several other movies I wish I could of watched instead."
1,Girl interrupted...,"This movie did not work. When I tried to play it, it said not compatible with my country. Not very happy, would like to return!"
4,Susanna has a lot of spirit and courage,I love this movie I gave it four stars instead of five because the acting was good but the story of her life did run flat like things in our life do. I did not like the plot thow well I dint get what the plot was supposed to be.
4,Impressive Work.,"Girl, Interrupted starts unconvincingly, but it makes up for a boring start when Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) arrives at Vannacutt Mental Institution when she is accused of killing herself.All the performances in Girl, Interrupted are downright amazing. Winona Ryder hasn't been this good in an extremely long amount of time, Angelina Jolie earned her Golden Globe undoubtely; her performance is strong and convincing. While those two leads got the most credit, other more un-known actors like Clea DuVall, Brittany Murphy and Elisabeth Moss also put in amazing effort in this impressive and satisfying drama."
3,I liked it.....,I liked this movie. It wasent my favorites but I think Winona Ryder did a great job. Angelina Jolie was good as well but I dont think she compared to Winona Ryder. In my opinion the movie was a little dull but worth a watch.
5,Good movie,Very well done. For those who have experience with family members that suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder this movie offers hope.
5,awesome,This movie is my favorite movie. I don't see why people can say that this movie is not amazing. Jolie and Winona do an awesome job of acting- and so does everyone else in it. The whole movie has a really cool feeling to it and the scenes jump around a lot which makes the movie insane. The DVD is really good because of the deleted scenes which are almost better than some of the scenes in the movie- why they were cut I don't know. Anyway -watch this movie -it is worth it.
5,Excellent!,I was very impressed with this order. The product shipped quickly and arrived between the 7-14 day window. The service was professional. I am very pleased with the service provided.
4,A Compelling Insight into the mind,"Girl, Interrupted brought me into its world of mental illness and female relationships very firmly. Whoopi Goldberg never seems to do a bad job in a film. This is not a ""thrill-a-minute"" film, and it's not supposed to be. It's a probing story of Susanna (Wynona Ryder) trying to wake from the haze of 'Borderline Personality Disorder', where you feel no sense of personal identity. As she tries to find a self in the dingy Claymore Hospital (filmed in a real mental hospital), the compellingly dark but powerful Lisa (Angelina Jolie, and she did deserve that Oscar) is strangely compelling to Susanna. The other characters in the ward are right on the money, too. If there were a better understanding of mental illness among the general public, this film would have won more than just Jolie's Oscar!"
1,Propet Marina Walker sandal,"These have to be sent back,I'm very disappointed,I ordered extra wide,but they are super narrow...I wonder if it's the brand?,this is the second pair of extra wide Propet brand shoes I've bought and I've found them both to be very narrow......I'm sure it's not me...I've got other shoes from a differant brand...same size,and they are excellent.....won't be ordering Propet any more!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS T.V. WITH VCR,"I had this t.v. less than three years before the VCR went out on it. If the VCR doesn't work, the television shuts off automaticly. I have been able to stick my fingers inside the VCR and have managed to get the t.v. to stop turning off instantly and automaticly. I have no idea what my fingers are doing to make the t.v. stay on. It's like the eject portion of the VCR stays on which causes the t.v. to turn off as soon as it comes on. What happened to the years when we could expect to get 10 or more years out of a television set. I purchased a brand new t.v. today. A 14"" Toshiba with no VCR or CD playes. I will be buying that separate as I cannot trust that I will be left without a television set again when the VCR/DVD goes out.I had to buy very expensive rabbit ears in order to be able to view this television set because it has very poor reception.Don't waste your money on this television set. I paid about $128 for it three years ago. It was a total waste of money"
3,Not a game as such,I guess I thought a picture of the book was a picture of a game box. This item consists of one book. In reality it is essentially a stock market class workbook to follow price of stocks over several months. It does look like a child could learn a lot from it though.
1,Dirty Work??? Try Sloppy Writing by S. Woods,I eagerly anticipated this book but was so disappointed and angered by the obvious sexist slant. The characters were flat. Plus there were tons of typos and run on sentences. Woods is slipping fast into dementia.
4,I've sometimes wondered about,"Stone Barrington's soul. I've read most of the books in this series, and sometimes, Stone decisions are right on the ethical/moral edge; especially the ones dealing with Arrington, the love of his life.However, in DIRTY WORK, Stone's sense of right and wrong shows up early and stays through the last line. I loved the contrast between Felicity Carpenter's English approach and Stone's ethically correct rationale in dealing with a deadly and very smart assassin.No spoilers here, but the ending was rather sad to me. However, Stone's moral compass was not bent or broken and it will live to serve him again.Good riddance to Ms. Carpenter. Hope she stays on her side of the pond. :)Than you, Mr. Woods, for diving below the surface.Enjoy!"
4,I'VE LEARNED MANY THINGS FROM IT.,"This book contains much information about my program in ""Tehran University"".I study on use of CO2 laser to remove white lesions of oral mucosa.I think chapters ""2,5,6,7,8"" are the best chapters of this book."
5,A Forgotten Classic,"Harquin was a favorite of mine as a young girl, and I now have the pleasure of sharing this great book with my son. Harquin lives with his family of foxes on a hilltop near a small village and squire's estate. They are able to live in peace as no humans are aware that foxes live up on the hillside. As the story goes, it seems that in every generation, one young fox is compelled to challenge their comfortable existence and go down to the valley where the squire and townspeople live. Inevitably, Harquin continually explores this forbidden territory until he is spotted by the gamekeeper. It is then up to him to figure out how to protect his brothers, sisters, and parents and somehow divert the fox hunt from his family home.The watercolor illustrations are lucious and bold, and the story appeals to my young son as much as it did to me when I was a kid. It is a great allegory of the wayward son, and a beautiful book to add to your child's collection."
5,Great original soundtrack,"I saw this play in London any years ago, and the recordings bring it all back to me. Excellent quality."
4,Trials and Triumphs,"I am a mother and student, I read this book for my college course and was truly surprised to find such wonderful writing in a children's book. Great detail, great story within a story, the trials and tribulations that everyone goes through in life, all ages, and the great feeling when you triumph them all. A must read for both of my children."
3,Eurotrash,"I think most of the other reviews cover this pretty well. If you like 70s porn, you'll probably like it. If you like current porn with more grooming, better lighting, and less campy music, you'll probably think it is OK.What I missed from the other reviews is the fact that they are not speaking English.If you want to follow the plot and enjoy a bit of the humor, you need to have subtitles on. I don't want to have subtitles on during a visual film like this. A person should not need to read during porn."
2,Graphic but disappointing,This Swedish movie from the 70s delivers on sexual content but at the price of any kind of involving plot....if that's important to you. I much prefer the French or Japanese models these days.
4,"Looks Good, Sounds Okay",I bought the I-Move at Target for $68.99 in Teal Blue. Its a basic Ipod stereo good for your home or office. It has enough sound for a room. Its doesnt have the most advance features. But just pop your ipod in and your all set to jam.
3,Interesting but not very practical,"This book is good, but written in a slightly professorial tone. The research presented is interesting, as the discussion. But I found it unpractical and difficult to use. I have read other books on the subject, more abordable. Good work, but I expected more."
2,Why so much of the same?,"This game is being enjoyed by our son, mainly because he just likes I Spy in general. Unfortunately the I Spy folks created this game ""on the cheap"" by using the same pages from their previous I Spy computer games. The riddles are new of course, but the pages are so familiar that it almost seems as if the player has done this before. Still fun of course, but I recommend that Scholasitc put a little more effort into being creative and spend a little more money on new pages next time around."
5,Work fine.,I have spent over 2 hours filling out how I rate products that I bought through the last year or so and then you have to have 20 more words in order for me to submit my ratting. This is it.
3,OK for light duty,"As a previous reviewer noted, this pan is worth Amazon's asking price. I can't imagine this being a ""go to"" chef's pan. If you value a pan that is ""prosumer"" quality, conducts heat evenly throughout preparation and holds a consistent temperture then look beyond this starter pan."
4,a little tipsy,I really like this line. It's beautifully shiny! Cooks great and cleans up easy. One kind of annoying design flaw with this particular piece though. Until there's enough food in it to counter weight the handle it tips over super easy. I like it so much I'm forcing myself to live with it.
3,No Index,"I recently purchased Volume II of the Iroquois Wars series. The text is derived from selected portions of Thwaites' ""Jesuit Relations"" undertaking, which must have been a labor of love sorting through those volumes in order to compile this work. Unfortunately there is no Index to the volume so if you are interested in a particular person or event you have to plow through the entire volume. This is most unfortunate. However for a handy extract of the above cited Relations it is a good addition to the source materials on the conflicts covered."
4,"A little convoluted, but it works...","This was my third Ross MacDonald/Lew Archer mystery and probably my last. As with all detective series type novels, they are starting to lose their luster. As a stand-alone mystery novel it is top-notch in both story and charactarization, although the plot wandered a bit. I don't have the deep insight provided by the previous reviewer, but I can say that if you like Chandler style LA Noir, this one is as good as it gets."
3,Battery HP,"The battery never goes any more then a ""good"" status in my laptop. Power runs down a bit quicker then the old battery did. Not real pleased!"
1,Bad Movie & I was very disappointed,"When I bought this movie, I was expecting something similar to Agent Cody Banks, but instead it was Big Fat Liar and the very beginning of Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dream. The acting was bad, the casting was bad, the plot, the directing and the music was bad. Anna Sophia Robb is an excellent actress, and did a wonderful job, however, she was the only experienced and decent actress in the whole movie.I am a big fan of almost all spy books and movies, but this movie had almost no spying in it at all (don't be fooled by the title ""Spy School"").I was very disappointed with this movie, and would not recommend wasting your money on it."
3,A Bit More Preferable than new Anthrax,"Same as his first release, Belladonna's solo stuff (like new Anthrax) lacks the character they both had when a unit together. His voice is still great, and I might prefer this to, say Anthrax's Stomp 442 album. Ho-hum, though."
5,Gr8,"This Def. is Jet Li's one of the finest. Esp. Fearless. Unleashed is good in Action too. That's the diff bn Jet and Jackie. Jackie is more towards the comedy part while in action which is good for laugh too, on the other side Jet is all serious action and some Crazy stunts. They both are good in their own way.Well over here Fearless/Unleashed are def. a good catch if you get a hold onto it. These both are good movies coming from a diff Genre. One is based in Old China and the other one shows the soft side of Jet while how he turned out to be a good guy from a monster.Grab IT !!!!!"
3,So far so good?,"I just received it, I thought it was an exact replica of minnie mouse bow, but it's not. So be aware of this. Though I will still try them and see how they turn out!! I'll update later!"
2,nice images ... poor production,"I liked the images included in the DVD; however, getting information for the different images or navigating between slides is an absolute frustration. I wanted to play the DVD in my Astronomy class but after going over the DVD I changed my mind for it would have been a nightmare to move between images and display the information for some of these images. Overall, the DVD is poorly produced, BIG TIME, and because of that I am giving it 2 stars."
2,Great Recipes! Lousy story,"A fan of culinary mysteries, I was pretty psyched when I found my first culinary romance at a booksale. I am glad I found it at booksale prices however, the story just was not worth my time.The story of Pomme an aspiring chef who fashions her own life after some of histories best authors. This leads to the best part of the book- her recipes. Taken from classic memoirs, letters and cookbooks the recipes are outstanding, but to me recipes alone cannot make the story more than a two."
2,Disappointing,"No matter how bad remarks were given to the Lonely Planet's edition on Hong Kong, after reading the Fodor's guide I went to bookstore to buy the edition of Lonely Planet. Disappointing, indeed."
4,Nice compilation,Get this and enjoy why Freddie was one of the best blues guitar players others tried to duplicate.
5,movie in music,"It is listening with imagery,you see the movie in your mind. I believe it is more authentic than the movie because I seem to hear extra music. It would be a challenge to listen to the CD and match it with the movie sound track. maybe I will some day. Meanwhile it is a beautiful piece of work. A lot of suspense,intrigue.gaiety and grit within this music. Elmer Bernstein is a master of his trade. Thank You R.F."
2,WOW!!!! Talk about a price increase!!!!!,"I am currently on my third SRF-M97. I dropped the first one more than once, and it finally gave out. The second out wasn't dropped, but it wore out (I listen to the radio at work, walking the dog, getting ready in the morning...). I'm looking to replace my present one because although it will still get FM, for some reason it won't get AM anymore (and that's what I listen to -- go Randi and Stephanie!).But there is NO way this radio is worth the new price. It's shocking that it's suddenly 3 times the amount of my 1st and over twice the price of the one I bought last year. The construction is REALLY, REALLY cheap.I obviously loved this radio (buying 3 of them), but it's mostly because of the size. This price is ridiculous."
3,"Great radio, but not real durable","This unit has great sound & reception...however, don't drop it (or as in my case, leave it somewhere where your cat can knock if off a counter)...it hasn't worked since."
4,Sony Walkman,"Enjoying it a great deal. Some stations seem to drift, but otherwise it being so compact it is a huge improvement on my other walkman. I walk at least 3 miles daily so it is my constant companion. It keeps excellent time. Using a single AAA battery is another huge plus. And the battery lasts a very long time."
1,"Decent styling, BUT...","I bought this because it was small (and, to be honest, a Sony-- a brand I've liked for other things). It's truly a radio for minimalists, though, and not at all in a good way. For the comparatively steep price:-- there are virtually no features (presets and extra bass aren't enough);-- the construction is shockingly CHEAP (what I would expect from a no-name drugstore brand instead), which means it would get easily crushed in my backpack; and-- the reception is poor, poor, poor (as tested in spots all around NYC).I'm returning it to try for something better made."
2,Same Experience,"My set of Robert Sorby tools also were poorly packaged and arrived, pardon the pun, askew! The chisels are well made but I could swear the packaging was made in China or Bangladesh. Very cheaply packed."
5,A Fabulous Healing Tool,"Throughout the book, Sherrie Eldridge discusses various problems we, as adoptees and even as rejectees, face. After each discussion, she offers a choice that we can make to find healing. I highly recommend this book as a healing tool for all adoptees, but especially for anyone dealing with self-esteem issues."
2,Cancer is a Comedy?,"A comedy? No. I turned this movie off after an hour. It has few laughs but seriously, who wants to watch the misery of someone young who has cancer and is probably going to die? It's a downer. The few funny moments don't change that. I'm sure that most of the glowing reviews on this page are written by studio-paid shills.Some of the writing is good, but the pervasive profanity is not real and is annoying. It doesn't add anything and one has to question why it's in there. The Seth Rogen character cares but is such a self-centered loudmouth (a foul one at that) that he negates his contribution to his friend and this movie.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is excellent and he made this into a movie instead of what otherwise would have been a series of predictable scenes.Overall, no more than two stars. I tire of shallow, self-absorbed, pseudo comedy.And, yes, I've had cancer and survived, so I'm not totally out of my league of experience."
5,Seth Rogan finally does it!,"I'm not a Seth Rogan fan. Every film he's done I've turned off 20 minutes into it (except Zak and Miri, which I should have done). I find he's the type of guy that has to use foul language to produce humor, and although this movie is rife with foul language, it's still hilarious. The story centers around Adam, who at the age of 27 finds out he has a malignant tumor. His best friend, Kyle, tries to help him deal with it in his own special way-by using it to get laid. Of course, this works, but does it work for the psyche? Adam has a lot to deal with on top of the cancer. There's his work, his relationship with his girlfriend, his parents and his therapist.This movie is fantastic. It's funny, yet touching, and it will leave you disappointed it's not any longer. One other thing it has going for it is a really strong soundtrack."
5,awesome movie,"This was a great movie the quality was also great, I cried wasn't really expecting that because well Seth Rogan was in it. He is so funny but the whole movie was just awesome. It touched my heart get ready for the tissue with this one you will laugh and you will cry. I ended the movie being very grateful."
5,Works at just about every level.,"This movie really surprised me. I liked it so much and it's hard to avoid cliches in describing it. So, here we go: I laughed. I cried. About the laughing: It's amazing how quickly I felt comfortable with humor about cancer. It's so skillfully down it just works right away and that's a surprise. I Now, about the crying. This movie, to it's credit, never manipulates the viewer into crying. It's not a tearjerker. But, you quickly come to feel such affection for the characters, and Gordon-Levitt's portrayal of the cancer patient is so genuine, that the crying feels honest and weirdly cathartic. Hat's off to the lead and to Seth Rogan for one of the most memorable screen friendships ever."
5,BRAVO!!,"I don't understand the people who are saying that this movie is so depressing and that's all it is. It has moments of sadness, it is about cancer after all, but there are definitely light and even funny moments in the film that obviously went over some people's heads. It is a story about friendship, cancer, and love. I don't think they could have picked better people to play the two main parts, they were very good. Yes this can be a tear jerker, but there are also moments of hilarity. I love this movie, it is a complete story, full of ups and downs. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a heartfelt story and can understand that the lighter moments of the film are just as necessary as the darker side. I laughed and cryed during this movie, it moves you, and that's what good film is supposed to do."
2,not funny,"tried to make a funny about a serious subject, it will not work when you have a loved one who succumbed to cancer."
2,NOT a comedy,"Others have said this but I want to restate for emphasis: The preview shows the funny moments - but all of them. The movie is not as uplifting as it sells itself to be, which is just false advertisement, and I wish I knew what I was getting into more. The movie is good EXCEPT for how terrible the therapist is ethically, arg!"
2,Not sure,I didn't really like it that much. The story was a little dramatic. Not something I will recommend to others.
3,Readable for math-lovers and math-haters.,"The book gives a unexpected look at the background of some great mathematicians in the world's history. It's easy to read, even for people who are not born in an English speaking country. The math in this book is not difficult to understand. Therefore the book is useful in the classroom for math-teachers (such as I am) who'd like to add some more to there lessons."
2,More for a kid!!,"I bought this trying to play santa in iraq... :) ... I obviosly bought more than just these items, all were great. I Have to say that these items were really small. The glasses barely fit ... the gloves were really, really cheaply made ... The Bell was awsome, about the only thing that worked"
4,Speedy,"This suppler messed up my order, but he was very fast and responsive to send the correct book back-can't say that for other people."
1,Great while it lasted,This mouse worked pretty solid when I first got it a couple of months ago. Now it comes unpaired ALL THE TIME. I have to grab another mouse just to go through the pairing process. Such a headache!! I should have spent a little more and just went with the Apple mouse.
5,This is the best one for BJJ,"I have several other BJJ DVD's and so far this is the best one. It is straight forward, clearly demonstrated from several angles, well spoken and kept simple. I found it easy to follow because it was very matter of fact, methodical and broken down very well. There is no irrelevant rambling or waffling on, just great technique expertly demonstrated one after the other. Very to the point, no fluff or BS.You get a bit sick of him saying ""boom!"" everytime a technique is applied, but it does emphasize the effectiveness of the technique and after a while it grows on you.When I bought it I did not realise it had three DVD's in it, gotta love the value!I would recomend this over the others definatley."
2,toolman kpj,"Buy the next step up, spend $49 instead of this cheaper model, I have both models and the more expensive model takes less time and is better."
2,Broken and late,"Showed up late and cracked. Ordered two, one showed uppromptly and the other about five weeks later.Didn't want to wait any longer so just glued broken areasand will live with it. Both are working fine and are excellentproducts. Other than the above mentioned problems, I am happywith the product. My friend has the first one and is also happy."
5,Wonderful!,"I bought this dehydrator and when I recieved it, I made over 14 pounds of jerky in a week and a half. It's small but if you do it right, you can fit almost 2 pounds on it at a time. The jerky was really good and my family wants to try fruits and different things. I am very satisfied with this purchase and it was a good investment. I am even thinkin of buying an even bigger one !"
4,What we live in,"I imagine they made this movie as somewhat a joke but it is too true in todays world. I give this movie as gifts to try and get people to realize what we are living in. I often see television shows and think ""Ouch My Balls"" because the show is so awful."
1,Don't waste your time,"One of the worst movies ever.My husband and I were left with damaged or lost brain cells after. LOL(which I got up and would rather be busy, but had to continue to listen)Terrible. We won't be getting movie advice from that person anymore!!"
4,Underrated,"This movie is highly underrated. Judge is great at satire and holds up the absurdities of life and culture and the current admiration of the mediocre and low brow to a frightening mirror behind even some of the silly gags. We should take note or we may end up almost this bad in the future. In the movie, a regular not too bright guy wakes up in the future and with the continuing lowering of standards (I see as a teacher) it is a funny but frightening future."
4,Scarier than Terminator and Matrix futures!,"Good movie, apparently the honesty in it scares some people. If you don't believe this is our future as a species watch Maury Povich's ""is you my baby daddy DNA testing episodes"" We are all doomed."
4,It Made Me Laugh,"Mike Judge never fails to make me laugh. Be it the low-brow Beavis and Butthead or the twenty-something comedy Office Space. Idiocracy is a little bit of both with plenty of stupidity and I think a ""message"" in there somewhere. A funny film about the future of mankind."
4,A Good Futuristic Spoof!,"This tale reminded me somewhat of Woody Allen's Sleeper. Luke Owen is put into suspended animation and wakes up 500 years later to find that man has evolved to complete idiocy, leaving him the world's smartest man. Though the movie is mostly silly, it still works, mainly because of Luke's excellent ""straight man"" job as someone who is stubborn to not accept what is but tries to change things to what he knows (water makes plants grow, not Gatorade). Some of the parts are incredibly funny."
3,Oh what it could have been!,"This is a funny, but deeply flawed film. Marred by an incredibly limp love story and horrible acting from Maya Rudolph, Idiocracy never lives up to its frighteningly funny potential. Sure, it has its share of funny moments, and probably comes pretty close to predicting the likely path of American culture. The only thing the future is missing is a Devo soundtrack. Then again, Devo's music would be way over their heads.With a little more edge, a little less mush, and better acting, Idiocracy could have been great. What a shame."
3,"Ok movie, just not what I expected. Funny parts.","I Like Mike judge, with Bevis and Butthead, King of the Hill, Office space etc, so to see this coming out, this was a must have. Overall, it funny, and I think it will grow on me. Essentially, it makes me think of a world ruled by beavis and Butthead. Luke wilson plays an average army soldier that gets cryogenically frozen and accidently is forgotten about and thaws 500 years in the future, and awakens to a world run by Dummies. Mya rudolf plays a civilian woman that was paid to be frozen as well, who to finds herself alongside Wilson in the future. The rest of the movie Wilson spend trying to get himself back to his time. Many funny parts, but just not as spectacular as I expected. Likely why it came out on DVD instead of in theaters. But, worth checking out, not a bad addition to a dvd collection."
1,How can anyone with a brain like this?,"I saw this with my dad and this movie is beyond bad. the jokes are really stupid like. ""wanna go family style on her?"" or ""but is has electrolytes"" HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT ""electrolytes"" ARE? this movie has the worst jokes and Maya Rudolph is stacked! and Obama becoming the first black president then this movie comes out? the acting and the movie is horrible. I rewrote my review cause the other one. I got made fun of a lot. cause, I have learned grammar and went to school. (no! I am not 12) so, do not watch this movie. I gotta get a honey bun!"
5,Inteligent comedy ....,"I hold this movie close to ""Office Space"". It is an ""inteligent comedy"", maybe they have few fart jokes but that is not the backbone of the story.It is worth the time... Enjoy"
5,Sometimes the Truth is Funny,"What can you say about this movie? Is it satire if it is really true? As someone who works on the Labor and Delivery ward, there is more truth in this film than most people want to believe. Funny movie! Watch it and see where the world is heading."
5,What is going on here,"Five Stars across the board. Great movie, great insight. If you have a sense of humor you will laugh throughout the entire film. For those of you that have put your blinders on, just move on.But I have a question???I have read several reviews here and I wonder how many people realize what they are saying, this goes especially for those that have written negative reviews here.A lot of reviews refer to this being about America.Did America jump 500 years to the future and the rest of the world is not included.The movie had a global scope, In a speech the President charges Joe with solving the world's problems: food shortages, dust bowls, a crippled economy, and related issues.The people writing to say that ""This is not happen"" also say its about ""America"" becoming stupider, do they realize that they already know America is the forerunner for the decline of society.Hmmm?End"
5,Brilliantly prophetic,"Idiocracy is very well made pitch dark satire of what's-going-on at present and where it will get us in the year 2505. It will leave you with a creepy thought that you may, like Joe [average Joe] and Rita [sex therapist]; unexpectedly wake up one day already living in 2505 and no Time Masheen will be able to take you back.Fantastic job Mike Judge! Ignore stupid Fox and every particular individual who couldn't get your joke - they do deserve one night of Rehabilitation. Humankind needs you. Keep up the great work, please."
4,DUMB BUT FUNNY,LOTS OF DUMBNESS BUT QUITE A FEW REALLY FUNNY PARTS. IF YOU LIKED OFFICE SPACE YOU WILL PROBABLY LIKE THIS
1,The best part... THE END!,Idiocracy is a derisive and caustic satire. I did not find it amusing. I would not recommend this movie as social commentary or as comedy.
1,duh,"Feal freee to kall me an ideot fer bying dis moove. wut a wayste of tiemm and munee.How can Mike go from office space to this? Maybe I should have gotten baked in order to enjoy this ""movie"". I wonder if Luke Wilson owed Mike Judge a favour or some money? Maybe they got together for a huge session and in the midst of all the smoke and confusion decided to go ahead with this debacle."
1,future? its today.,The main problem with this movie is the producers are living probably in France otherwise they should know English language will not survive another 100 years in US and this is Idiocracy.
3,"Not bad, but not direct enough","The concept is on the money - pound for pound, American's are among the dumbest people on the planet - but the director wasted some prime opportunities to help educate the American people about their government. Too many low-brow jokes and not enough hard-hitting satire."
5,Must See,This is very educational and everyone in the world should watch this movie to understand how they shouldn't be in life.
3,Good...,"Not as thoroughly funny as ""Office Space"" but an enjoyable view. Recommend renting in lieu of buying."
1,Stupid Movie,This movie was dumb and stupid really stupid. I went to sleep on it and did not watch it again.
4,This movie outlines my worst fear: de-evolution,"I loved this movie, it was recommended by a friend and I'm glad that I took his recommendation. It annoyed my wife somewhat, but she couldn't stop watching either. Definitely not something to watch when the kids are in the room; the intellectual downslide depicted in this movie comes complete with the lazy, ignorant, vulgar speech patterns that are already taking root in today's society. After watching this movie, you will never look at those slovenly, unsophisticated, prolific families walking around Wal-Mart the same way again. When I see these people now, I can't help thinking: ""It's already happening!"" This movie should be compulsory viewing for smart people: We need to step up our breeding campaign."
5,I hope this doesn't end up as a true story.,Great movie by Judge. If you liked Office Space you will also enjoy this movie. Mya Rudolph plays a good role too.
3,Just wrong enough to be cute,"Normally when a movie has such a weak plot they have a narrator I am turned off.But I finished the movie and even enjoyed a few scenes. This isn't for children, but for big people who think like kids."
3,Surreal. Almost funny.,"This is a surreal movie: highway interchanges with highways that end in mid-air, Costco stores big enough to be visible from space, an acre of orange sofas, advertising *everywhere*, America a third-world nation via stupidity rather than coruption, the House of Representin', a pro-wrestler President. Oh, and Fox News as a soft-porn smack-down news channel.And there's more!Though there are a lot of funny parts to the movie, I don't think it's as funny a movie as ""Office Space"". Set in the future, it really doesn't hit as close to home as ""Office Space"" did. Plus, I don't really see the future as belonging to the stupid. Among other things, the ""Darwin Awards"" give me hope.I guess I'd mark this as a funny cautionary tale, and leave it a that. Since I own the DVD, and will watch it now and again, maybe my opinion will change over time."
4,Dry irreverent humor ... U DUMB S,"The farmer / engineer I work with recommended this due to his daughter's environmental homework, specifically the crop Gatorade scene.Having seen the movie, the sight gags are a hoot. I won't tell you about them because that's part of the magic of watching a new movie.It was worth watching 1.5x. The half for catching small details missed the first time. The special features were funny. They were just deleted scenes that didn't add to the movie. When the movie loads up, the display is confusing, but is intended for idiots whom wish to be overloaded with dumb options.Good for a laugh ...;)"
1,this was awful,"if I could give it negative stars I would. The movie was not funny, I finally just turned it off."
3,Needs update...,"A great review of pertinent topics broken up into short, easy to read ""chapters"". This book covers a broad base of anesthesia knowledge with important detailed facts interspersed in appropriate places. That being said I would look for alternatives if I had to buy a similar book again. My reason is the same as has been stated multiple times in these reviews - this book is outdated. As an example, there is a whole section on rapacuronium which is described as a new drug having ""the potential to replace succunylcholine as a means of achieving brief-onset muscle relaxtion"". Yea...it was withdrawn from the market over a decade ago."
4,"Good, but needs an update","Great review book for all the previously mentioned reasons (i.e: concise, short chapters with the ""must know"" information). However, it is time for an update, as most of the chapters have references from the '80s and '90s. An overhaul is needed to stay relevent in the everchanging world of anesthesia."
1,bad bad just playn bad...,"First I do not like book's were the character's fall in love so damn fast and thay don't even know one another. First the the hero Gunnar kidnaps her then treets her like s*** porden my french, and in four day's or less she is madly in love with him, oh please. And then their is Nigal the rapist of the town aka the heroine's brother who findes and rapes all virgin's who in the begining trys to rape his own sister even though he knows thats his sister he is madly in love with her, yuck by the way. And trys to make her merry him yuck agien. Anyway thier is alot of things that set me off in this book in a bad way but that is my opinion, so hope this review helps in your decision ."
3,pleasant book,"I'd give 3,5 stars if I could. It was pleasant reading but after Lord of Vengeance and Lady of Valor I think I see the pattern and I don't need to read more of Lara Adrian's books though I liked it."
5,healing of the hearts,"I loved this book. Very well written,, good plot and a great justice for all. Very sexy and steamy. Must read."
5,Great story,I enjoyed this book. Great heroine -great hero. I loved the development of the storyline and the struggle both main characters endured within their hearts. I would read other books by this author.
3,Standard stuff,"Lara Adrian has written far better books. This is definitely a boiler plate bodice ripper. Nothing wrong with it, but there is no reason to recommend it or keep it in my Kindle. I will never want to reread it. Frankly I was relieved when it was finished."
5,Love.,"Happily, Dan Kern is not a corporation looking for profit: he's just a guy who had bad skin and found a way to manage it. [...] I bought the book as a small thank you to Kern for being nice enough to provide the info for free. If you buy products thru his site, he gets a kick-back -- and if you don't, that's ok, too. For this reason, he deserves the support. Kind of like shareware for books. And his easy if not always fun regimen has been working so far, so kudos."
3,way to go,every thing was fine good product and i received it in a very timely manner keep up the good work
3,SOUR????????????,"Okay, these are good, but when it comes to being sour, these..... well, they're just NOT. I love them though."
5,Replacement for daughter,"It worked great, and it fit the keyboard. I was a little apprehensive because I didn't know if it was the right one. We plugged it in and started using it right away."
1,im just gonna say it.. DONT waste your money..,"This game is the SAME exact game, graphics, cars, drivers, and tracks as last years game. they might as well call is ""nascar 2005 continued""I remember when i bought nascar 2003, and when i bought 2004 the next year there was a HUGE difference in driving,tracks,career mode, and A LOT more :)but from '05 to '06, it leaves me to believe that EA sports will be out of buisness in the matter of SECONDS. im sorry, im just being honest."
5,Very nice set of diamond wheels,Wheels fit the shank well and performed well. Very nice set for the price. I have paid slightly more for these before and was very disappointed in them. I would not think twice about ordering these! Top quality at a rock bottom price.
2,Not great at cutting and the Mandrel broke off.,"Maybe I used too much pressure, but the mandrel broke off. I bought a Mandrel replacement from Dremel for now."
5,excellent and useful product,"This product lived up to my every expectation, I was using it to complete an art project and had to cut a 400 watt light bulb, the 1 disc I've used performed very well, and the shipping was quick and well packaged...As to price, I paid less for 5 discs than dremel wanted for one, and I don't see how dremel's could be any better... I used it with a Black and Decker mulit speed rotary tool..."
2,sub par,"They looked good on the website, but when I actually got them I found they didn't really cut aluminum all that easily.I don't know how they would be cutting steel, but I found myself very disappointed with these wheels. Then after a few attempts at cutting the very small screw holding the wheel on broke. overall a bad deal.I don't know if the more expensive diamond wheel would have been a better choice but I can only hope they use better quality screws."
1,Garbage,"I bought these ?diamond? wheels to cut hard steel. Upon touching the steel with the edge of the wheel, all of the grit immediately came off and the wheel would not cut or even scratch the surface. Tried another wheel with extremely light pressure and the same thing happened. In addition to the poor coating, the mounting hole of each wheel is off-center, causing vibration and only part of the edge makes contact. One wheel even had a flat spot on the edge. Very poor quality.I used a genuine Dremel diamond wheel on the same steel and it cut just fine."
3,A Powerful Story Mixed With Science and Sex,"Three go back-back 25,000 years, to Lost Atlantis.-and those good people, our kindly ancestors. -"
5,one of my favorite ghost books,"Between the eye-catching layout and informative text, this is one of my favorite ghost books. When I went to Savannah, GA, it proved an invaluable resource. The only complain that I have with it is that it covers so much ground, that it doesn't have more space to devote to each city - but that's the nature of a book like this. Definitely recommended to anyone who likes to plan trips around the bizarre and unexplained."
2,"It's the Dan, but....","...not the Dan at their best. Not even close.All the energy seems to have been sapped from an amazing repertoire of brilliant, twisted songs. The good news is: they can still RIP in concert -- as the current PBS broadcast of a live show reveals. They sure as hell haven't lost it... but ""it"" was clearly on hiatus during the performances on this disc.There's so little power in the performance that you almost have to wonder if this release had more to do with financial need or contract obligations than showing off their brilliance. Get everything else (well, okay, maybe skip Kamakiriad). But only the most die-hard Steely Dan fans will find this one worth having... and even then, more for curiosity than anything else."
1,bad,at now (02/26) i diden'thave received my cd. I don't know if this depend by the italian post service or your service. The first and the last time i buy something with internet.Andrea
3,Woodstock D3228 4-Piece Dental Pick Set,"Not a bad dental kit, but tools could have been of a little better quality and design."
2,20$??,"not worth 20$!!!(20 with shipping) without it you only work your chest and triceps, they are the only sore muscles ive got right now ive been using pp for 3 days now. this dvd would work but it is NOT worth your 20$.the price is high cause they know its a must when u buy the pp."
1,Bad Business,"The Perfect Pushup product is pretty good, but the company's business practices are weaselly. Let's see, you have to buy the product for fifty bucks, then spend 10 bucks on the workout cards (No, they're not included) and then spend another 15 bucks for the DVD. This should all be in one package.Decent product, but I can't support this company."
4,"Goat Milk Powder is a good ""out of milk"" solution","This product lived up to my expectations with the exception that it remains a little bit lumpy even after mixing it. Not sure why, but...I bought this powder as a solution to running out of natural milk for my coffee. Also, my Publix store is not doing its job yet in the ""natural department.""This powder is convenient to have on hand for smoothies and baking. I keep it in the refrigerator for last minute needs. I really like it and hope to find it in my grocery store or health food store some day."
2,Mini Voice Changer,"I ordered(2)for my grandsons and the first was opened and would not work, 2nd opened and would not work. I spent $8.00 and got 2 pieces of junk. I rate this product a -0- minus. Too expensive to return but I should & make them pay for s/h~The manufactor should be put out of business. This is a rip-off and Amazon should report them to BBB...They're making a killing on profits while customers are disappointed in their purchased item~This is shameful and the sellers of this item should refuse to sell it until it is revised to work properly. Don't bother taking it all apart b/c it does no good. It still want work. Tootles"
1,you get what you pay for,For $5.oo don't expect good quality. My 4 yo liked it but got tired of it. It has 3 voice settings which pretty much sounded the same to me.The only thing I like about this product is that it's size is perfect for my 4yo son. Not really a good bday present ..but could be a good bday party treat.
2,Ed Gein,"You won't find the true story here. Pure Hollywood blood and gore, if you like that kind of thing. But if you're looking for more, this isn't the movie for you."
1,Awful machine!,"I bought this machine in January at a B&M store. I didn't do any research because I just wanted a basic machine and had read good reviews for Brother machines. This weekend I finally needed to use it to recover 5 cushions. What should have taken a couple of hours used up a whole weekend causing headaches and much cursing. I had to finish the project so I continued to deal with the bobbin clogging up, thread tangling in the upper mechanism, huge knots on the bottom of my fabric. I finished this morning hand sewing the final two seams. It's too late to take it back; I've learned a lesson here. It's going in the trash with less than 20 hours on it. My hb said to sell it or give it away, how could I do that knowing what a piece of trash it is?"
1,Spend your money elsewhere........,"I bought this machine on AMAZON in 2008 - I think it was a refurb. It worked fine for awhile but then it consistently started the stitch skipping problem other reviews mentioned. Now it cannot even make a straight seam with out the thread either breaking on getting all wacked out in the bobbin.I have cleaned this machine, adjusted the tension, gave it a new needle etc. After spending 3 hours in frustration trying to hem a pair of jeans, I gave up. I called a local sewing machine repair shop and was told, ""don't waste your money.""I have since bought a used, older Singer.Do not buy this machine unless you enjoy fighting with it!"
1,Don't waste your time and money,"OMG,bought this machine and planed to finish school projects from home,ended up needing to clean up the bobbin case every 5 minutes because threads keep getting caught for no reason.Don't waste your time and money on this machine..."
5,Still works,For the price... holly smokes! I must of paid 2 buck at most and it's been several month. Keeps going and going. Was slightly late arriving but does not detract from the product being what it is. I really have no complaints. Still using my Kodak LS743 and my older LS420.
1,Very displeased,"Mike- what were you thinking? Being a huge late 80's early 90's hard rock fan, I searched for years for this album. I finally received it, and I wish I could send it back. This album's lineup consists of all new members (minus Metijevic). The raw, gritty rock edge appearantly left with the old members. What is left is a Barry Manalow meets Great White mix of cheesy ballads and 70's style guitar. I increased my search for the album once I heard ""We all die young"" on Rock Star, but buyers beware- The version on Wait IS NOT THE SAME as on Rock Star! Replace the guitar magic of Zakk Wylde form the soundtrack with a 12 year old kid playing an old Gorilla amplifier and you've got the Wait mix. Metijevic should not have kept the name of steelheart for this album, it is very misleading, as the music is nothing like the original steelheart rock. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
5,Ramekins,"My wife wanted some of these because the silicone cups she had were not working for creme brulee. I bought them and could not be more pleased. They are very nice looking and are just the right size for a serving. There were also a few color choices to choose from and that was nice since not everyone has the same color tastes. Also, the price was right."
1,not for cloth diapers,"If you're looking for a wet bag for cloth diapers, this is not the bag you want. The drawstring doesn't hold it closed - you'll be sure to smell the dirty diapers. The material isn't good for diapers either. It's cute and that's about it."
3,Hard to launder,I bought this bag to use as a travel bag for my cloth diapers. It held the moisture well enough. But the straps were a twisted mess after I washed it in the machine.
1,Not waterproof,"I purchased this bag to carry my wet bikrym yoga clothes home in. First, the bag is not as large as is advertised, mine was 12""x14"". Worse than that, the bag is not even remotely waterproof. I used it once and it leaked immediately. I switched to a trashbag that has held up for over a month. This bag might be okay for carrying lightly damp items, but that's all. Not a good buy at all, I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone."
3,A pretty good experience,"The robe did arrive in between the specified dates, but unfortunately it was one day after our event! The robe was more narrow than I expected so the dancer who wore it could barely move in it. All in all, this was my first experience with ordering something from Amazon.com and I will do it again at some point."
3,Too Fly to Fly,"What happened to staying true to your origins? I was a big fan of The System in the late 80s. I just found a CD importer in Japan that had back copies of The Pleasure Seekers CD (very excellent disc by the way).My problem is that they have changed directions from their R&B/Pop/Dance origins to a very funky sound, which I guess is to find a new fan base (however, old fans will find it hard to listen to).I don't have a problem with funk, I just did not expect that from them.Sure is hard to find info about them on the internet? They need a Fan Site.I hope the next one is more like (DDTG)."
5,a good place to start,"Although two full-length collections of Caitlin Kiernan's short stories are available (as well as two novels), this chapbook is a good place for the uninitiated to start. It contains three of her short stories, including one that was chosen for Best New Horror. Creepy, creepy good."
1,Disappointed,"I would expect a popular entry-level international relations book to have a good overview (which it had) and deal with current issues (which it did) - but not with the blatant superficial biases against US policy masked in glib rhetoric and without any consideration of alternative viewpoints. Furthermore, I found it to be extremely US-centric; presenting viewpoints of the world that only a leftist American would espouse and certainly not a thoughtful citizen of the world. The authors would have been better to disclose up front what eventually becomes obvious after the first few chapters. So much for intellectual honesty."
4,NO audio cassette??????? Huh??,"All the Wheelock books are great, but why no audio cassette? The books tell you to read it aloud. How are you supposed to know if you are pronouncing all the words correctly? Really bad omission!!!!!!"
2,Not very useful,Bought this workbook along with the 6th edition revised textbook. I don't see this workbook adding more value. Exercises are not very helpful.
3,Latin Workbook,"Ii's a shame that the workbook lacks an answer key. What is fine for perhaps a high school student whose teacher uses the workbook as a means of checking homework is not for college/graduate students who want to use it as a self-testing vehicle without the need to go back to the material in the book. The self-testing exercises in the book, with their answer key are much more helpful and less time consuming. I would suggest to the publisher to add a key either in the workbook or as a supplement."
5,You CAN get the Answer Key,"It just arrived in the mail today after six weeks of waiting. I wrote a letter stating my reasons for needing it and attested that I am not enrolled in a Latin course. Now I am going out today to buy my copy of Workbook for Wheelock's Latin. So, 5 Stars to HarperCollins for following through with sending me the Answer Key. ;>)BTW, No I will not send you a copy. Unfair? No. 1)It is copyrighted material of HarperCollins Publishers, 2) I don't know if you are enrolled in a class that uses this as a textbook, and 3) It's 64 pages long. I'm not photocopying or scanning all that!"
2,This is NOT 10- feet,"It worked for my application for a leaf vacuum cart but was no were near 10 feet. At best, figure 7-or 8 feet (at best). The construction is softer then the stock leaf vacuum hose but it was designed for air and not lawn duty. The softer construction does cause it to flop down and not hold its shape as the replacement item did but it worked! And for a whole lot less than the replacement hose. Just make sure you need no more than 8 feet at best."
5,Product as Described,Product arrived on time and as described. Why does a review have to be a certain length? I want to protest Amazon forcing me to write more than I feel NECESSARY! I feel others should do the same.
4,Remembering Memories of Mom,"A charming and peculiar biography about a writer, his alcoholic and artistic mother, and the rest of the family that formed around them. Antrim uses a kind of stream-of-consciousness style much like our own memory works: he flits from remembering his mother's dying to buying an expensive queen-size bed, from his uncle's station wagon stuffed with fishing lures and Playboys to the nature of addiction and recovery. Wonderful and moving writing - experimental without being off-putting, heartfelt while still being intelligent."
2,No good,The springs on it are weak. Whatever you put in it will not stay. I used it for my keys and they were constantly coming out.
2,One Glaring Defect,"The S-biner is a great concept, but the springs holding the clamps in place are far too weak. Key rings, car fobs and my Fisher space pen have all fallen off and been lost at some point using this keyring.Until they can improve the quality of the springs to make them less prone to opening in your pocket, stay away."
4,Monkey On my Back,This little gadget is a better alternative to the other child harnesses that are around and the child loves it.
5,Awesome - Keeps My Son in Tow!,"My son loves the way this looks and keeps his little cars in it while we're on the run and shopping, etc. The cars keep him busy while I shop and the ""tether/tail"" keeps me from worrying about him scurrying off - as he has been known to do in the past. Others have actually stopped us to ask where we got it!"
4,Gold Miner's Slaughter!,"Despite it's awkward title and slow start, ""Miner's Massacre"" turns out to be quite an interesting take on the slasher genre. Here we have a group of friends(who look wayyyyy to old to pass as teenagers) searching for treasure in an old mine. The locals repeatedly warn them not to go near the mine for good reason. They are soon stalked and slaughtered by a re-animated 1800's-era miner who's trying to protect his gold.What ""Miner's Massacre"" lacks in originality, it makes up for in it's humorous script and memorable characters(particularly the Steve Buscemi lookalike Axl). The young actors are attractive and mostly appealing, and the cast is rounded out by some seasoned vets(John Philip Law, Karen Black, Richard Lynch, Jeff Conaway, and Martin Kove).""Miner's Massacre"" is a satisfying blend of horror, action, and comedy. It may not be the best of it's genre, but it's hard not to like this movie."
2,The Miner's Gold Should Stay Buried...,"The Miner's Gold should stay buried, and so should this DVD! From beginning to end, this DVD was a disapointment. I chose to give it 2 stars, although it is more deserving of a 1.5. The idea itself put me in mind of a mummy film- disturb the treasure, and awaken an evil curse. First, the film seemed to ""bright"" to fit the horror genre. Second, the film score was not at all ominous enough to invoke any type of fearful anticipation (Except for the end of the movie!) Third, the actors looked more like teen-show actors than actors of a horror film. The only good spot in the film was a 20 second strip dance given by a well-built red head. My recommendation...this one should go back to the dust."
3,Wanted a little more,"I enjoy Jonathan Butler as an artist---incredible talent, however, this CD left me wanting a little more from this project. Some good worship songs. I was disappointed to find that my favorite song ""Falling in Love with Jesus"" was not the version that is frequently heard on the radio with Kirk Whalun."
5,Wonderful !!!!!!,"This CD is now in my car, on my computer and on my MP3 player. This CD puts me in a wonderful mood when worshiping time is at hand. I LOVE his voice and his lyrics. This is a MUST HAVE...YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. PROMISE !!!!"
1,Made in Taiwan. Poor Qualithy,"Unfortunately, this product is Made in Taiwan, and is no better that the cheaper brands from major auto parts stores. Returned and purchased from Toyota."
4,"A Dense, Earthy Read","I read a good review of Salthill in the Globe & Mail. It talked about the lyric writing and full-bodied characters. Besides, I like horses! So I bought the book. Salthill turned out to be about lots of other things too; family and redemption, and the nature of love. It's not a light read, but it was so involving the pages seemed to fly by. The setting, a horse ranch in the Canadian wilderness in the 1940s, was intriguing. I would recommend Salthill to anybody."
1,NBA Live 07 A Real Dud!,I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME. I FEEL LIKE I WASTED MY MONEY ON THIS GAME. THE GRAPHICS WERE HORRIBLE AND THE GAME PLAY WAS EQUALLY AS BAD. I ENDED UP GIVING THIS GAME TO MY NEPHEW WHO IS A VERY YOUNG MAN WHO MAYBE IS NOT AS CRITICAL AS I AM. I SURE EXPECTED MORE FROM THIS GAME AND CAME UP AS THIS GAME DOES-SHORT!
2,Terrible frame rate and loading.,All I have to say is this is by far the worst nba live game for the ps2 ever!Not that this is the worst basketball game I have ever played because nba inside drive 2000 is the worst.The loading times tick me off so much that I feel like snaping my controler in half.The whole draft simulated takes about 15 minutes so you might have the game sold by then.Also the frame rate is terrible.Nba live 2001 has better frame rate then 07 so I would not reccomend this game.
5,solid tools,"solid construction, ball end is a plus. needed for moving awkwardly positioned allen screws at back of engine block. key fit right in, and after some coaxing, screws eventually loosened. very good quality, highly recommended."
1,Poorly packed and poorly made,"We returned most of our Schlage Plymouth locks. They were delivered without any packaging in generic brown boxes. Inside many of the locks were scratched. The plate that attaches to the door wasn't exactly flat so a slight gap could be seen between it and the door.Also, the finish was really poor. I have moved all my locks to Kwikset now and those are an order of magnitude better. Really really bad quality."
3,"one book came on time,,,one was too late","I ordered two books with estimated delivery date of 2/27.....both were though surrogate sellers....one came a copule of weeks late, the other came two days ago...too late for it's intended purpose and for which I'm asking a refund....I have already sent it back to International Books. They said that thre mailing label came off of the package and it was returned to them resulting in the delay. loulitwin"
1,Badly produced bubblegum rock,"I was really disappointed by the production on this album. These days it's possible to deliver a better production on your home PC. Don't waste your money on this album unless you're a die hard fan. It's the worst production I've had the displeasure of encountering. After reading some rave reviews on the net I really looked forward to hearing the album, only to be sorely disappointed. All said this is nothing more than badly produced bubblegum rock."
5,Extremely helpful!,"I bought 3 books about this subject, and this book was definitely the most informative. Even if you aren't from the US, you will still find a lot of the information helpful and relevant."
2,"heavy, cheap materials, did dry hair fast","This hair drier worked wonderfully for the first few weeks. Then it started falling apart. The cord began working loose from the plug and the non-standard screws made that impossible to fix (not that you're legally allowed to do that). It is a heavy unit and its long cord was even heavier so it would drag itself off the counter with stunning regularity, threatening safety of toes and eventually breaking the rear filter cap. Within a few months it also developed an incessant and annoying whine (perhaps also from the falls). It does dry hair fast and shiny, if you can keep it from suicide jumping from the counter. Too expensive for shoddy workmanship."
4,What a great and informative book!,"This book is a life saver for busy new moms. You don't spend your whole time looking for the info you need, it's right at your fingertips! It's saved me and my boys' pediatrician lots of headaches by letting me know when I should and shouldn't call the doctor."
1,"Does not fit 3/4"" hose","The description says these fit 3/4"" hose. They do not. They are made for 5/8"" hose, period."
2,English wierdo's,I always liked their music. But I've read about quite a few 70's rock bands and this group sounds like a bunch of out of control babies with a wierd sexual fiend. I would not have wanted to hang out with them.
4,So many years in too few pages!,"This book is a wonderful insight into the history and workings of Aerosmith. It would be meaningless speculation if it had been told by anyone but the band themselves. This book sets the record straight on a lot of issues and is very informative for every Aerosmith fan. My only complaint is that it was over so fast. These guys have a lot to say and I wish they had shared a lot more of it with us. Overall, a good read."
5,"An extremely candid, honest memoir","This is a great book! I have been a huge fan of Aerosmith since ""Toys in the attic"". This is a no holds barred account of the groups life. I am impressed by the fact that the group was able to turn their lives around and they continue to surpass the other rock groups. They are truly the best rockers. a must have!!"
5,Rock's Best Rags to Riches to Rags to Riches Story.,"A great, great read. Alternately insightful, fascinating, depressing, and inspiring. Arguably the all time greatest rock band talks honestly about their sky-high successes and near fatal excesses. After completing this book, the only conclusion you can possibly draw is the good Lord must be a huge Aerosmith fan. There is absolutely no reason S. Tyler, J. Perry, and the LI3 didn't follow in the steps of Hendrix, Bonham, and all the other great talents who let addictions prematurely end their careers. To the benefit of everyone who loves this band (including yours truly), they cleaned themselves up and clawed their way back. This book tells that story with tremendous humour and honest detail. If you are a member of the Blue Army, this is an absolute must read. I recommend Ian Hunter's 'Diary of a Rock Star' if you like the Aerosmith book. However, I also wish you the best of luck trying to find it."
4,Cute,"This is a book about a mixed group of dinosaurs that go sailing. Bet you never saw that coming :)It's very cute, and it does offer a lot of chance to learn some specialized nautical terms like ""galley"" (which you probably never have a chance to say to your preschooler). I will say that the use of dino- in front of every other word can get grating after a while.There is one scene where the entire ship spews out vomit. My nieces read this book avidly for that one scene so they can yell ""EW! GROSS!"" because, like most children, gross humor is where it's at. If this is the sort of thing you don't like, though, please read this book before you buy it."
5,First child book,"This was the first child book we bought for our son, and we still read it year after year. The vomit scene wasn't a big deal Iin our family, we instead focus on having fun reading the story."
5,Great live proformance by My Morning Jacket,"I discovered the Indie rock (sometimes they are classified as Alt-country, but don't let that deter you, they rock!) group recently seeing them on Austin City Limits. This live concert DVD covers their earlier work. It is fantastic."
2,Did not hold up! Don't buy it!,"This sauna suit fell apart from just a few wearings. It worked good, before it tore. I do not recommend it."
4,WORKS GREAT USING MY ELLIPTICAL...-O-o-,Elliptical + this sauna suit!!= Hot Hot HOt works great I use it every morning @ 9am 45mins and night@9pm 45mins. REALLY 45 MINTUES !!
