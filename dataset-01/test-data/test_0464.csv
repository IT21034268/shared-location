4,Bud's Adventure,"This story takes place In the past in Flint Michigan, and also in Grand Rapids. It's important on where it takes place because Bud takes a journey in hoping to find a man who he thinks is his father but not yet sure, he goes and looks for the man.This book is mostly about a boy named Bud who lives in an orphanage. And he gets sent to a home with people who aren't so nice to him. Bud runs away from that family but doesn't want to go back to the orphanage home. The second half of the story he sets out to go look for the man who he is thinking is his father .In my opinion this is a good book because it has great and interesting characters in the book and also because it's a good adventures book this book is also very funny."
5,"Bud, Not Buddy is a must read!","Bud Caldwell is a 10-year-old boy who lives in Flint, MI. His mother died when he was 6 and he is a orphan. Finally, when Bugs finds a friend he heads west on a train to the Windy City. Now Bud is on a mission, to find his father. His mother only leaves him one clue: a flyer about Herman E. Calloway and the Dusky Devastators of the Depression!!!!!! So Bud sets out to find his father or so he thinks. This is a 5 star book and I recommend it. Bud, Not Buddy recieved the Newbery Medal and the Coretta Scott King Award. I recommend it if you are interested in theGreat Depression. This is a good read for upcoming Black HistoryMonth in February."
2,Little action but good description and language,"Bud, Not Buddy has very little action, although the language was good. I think the best highlight of the book was how Bud was made. I liked the way he talked and what he thought. The plot was very good and the ending was kind of unexpected. I recomend this book to people who don't like action. The story takes place in the 30's during the Depression. I didn't like this book very much. It was boring and not cool."
3,bud not buddy,"This book was not as good as I had expected it to be.The jazz setting was original and quite different but the book all in all was pretty moderate.The beginning was very good,though. Deja vu... have I read this story before?"
3,Cute book,"This book is an occasionally funny fairy tale-like story of an orphan that has run away from an abusive foster home to find his father. It is definitely inferior to recent Newbury winners like Holes, Walk Two Moons, The View from Saturday, The Giver, maniac Magee, or anything by Nancy Farmer. To me, the most frustrating part of the book is its unemotional, detached rendering of the boy's reminiscences of his mother. He does not appear to be angry or or sad or upset that she died; instead, he appears to be happy that she has passed on to a better life. Zero emotion. The mother's death does not affect her son at all. It made no sense to me. But that is typical of the cardboard characters in this book. Apart from that, the actual story is cute. With so many good books out there, I probably won't read it again."
5,Out of the molecules comes 'Gluon'--and I am drenched,"this is the album that doesn't leave me.this is the album that i take everywhere i travel.i love this album. i had never heard Hi-Posi before, but when my friend's girlfriend brought it to my house, i copied it. since then it has been my most listened to album. before i got my ears around this, i was spending most of my time with Phil Glass and Brian Eno's early works.so watch out Cornelius, here comes Hi-Posi."
1,"Awful, awful, awful","If I could give less than a 1 star I would. Thank goodness Amazon will let you return a book sometimes.The other 1 star review really said it all but let me just reiterate.(1) The writing was sub par and poorly done. Immature, it was more like reading a teenagers school story than a professional author.(2) No character development at all. Like the writing, the characters acted and sounded more like badly written teens than mature adults who had the capability to run million dollar companies.(3) I skimmed the parts with his friends. It was just cliched and clearly thrown in so the author could write more badly written books about them later.I really don't know how this could have been published by a professional firm. Please don't waste your money."
3,Good product,"It's a fine product, we just happen to prefer the Nestle's milk chocolate chip flavor more. But when this product is available at half the cost of Nestle's, I will opt for Hershey's to save money."
5,Excellent !,"This book is a must read for any man or woman! For centuries the ancient taoests have known of sexual secrets that are just now becoming known to Western society, how long did it take us to learn of accupunture? These authors have a sexualtity clinic (I'd love to attend) in Calif. I have studied every book I could get my hands on and found this one on ESO to give exact step by step instructions on how to pleasure your partner. I have used it on past girlfriends and taken them to places they didn't know their own bodies could take them. Complete loss of time and place while wave after wave of deep slow contractions went on for 1-2 or more hours. I've given it as a gift to some of my male friends and they had the same results with their wives/girlfriends. While she is ""lost"" you'll know exactly how to ""read her internally"" as to what to do next. This is beyond multiple orgasm. You owe it to yourself and the one you love to know these secrets. Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy Mel"
3,Eloquent with interesting opinions but not deep and profound,"Ted Koppel is quite eloquent and has many interesting views but the audiobook (unabridged) lacks any deep and profound views or analysis. Nevertheless, well read and not boring. Good for long drives or plane flights, especially now that it is selling at a discount price."
4,Interesting Look into a Reporters Mind,"I enjoyed this book of Ted Koppel's private thoughts. One never thinks about the tearful goodbye's to a reporter's loved ones before leaving on a dangerous assignment. Nor considers the unpleasant conditions which much be endured while reporting such a story. I found that the book put a much more human face on neat and tidy reports we see on the evening news. It was also interesting to hear Ted's take on the major news stories of the year. Opinions that could not be shared on national TV.It gave a certain level of comfort to know that a person who has such control over what we hear of the news, is really just a regular person who goes to the store, gets gas for his car and is excited about the birthday of his grandson.A quick read. I skimmed some parts about the Chechen's. But then isn't what he said in the book after all. We, as a nation ,are not too interested in that news."
3,From concrete to abstract,"In this book over-burdened with abstruse, over-written, abstract musings, one very concrete passage stands out. A trunk filled with Holocaust archival documents from Lithuania is opened in a stark, functional room in Customs at JFK Airport. The passage focuses several of the key themes in the book with powerful, poetic economy of language. The reader is able to use the telling imagery to make her own transition to universal and timeless truths. Nothing else has so challenged my rejection of a transcendent god than this passage. Doctorow has forced me to re-think my theology."
1,Ugh!,"I can't remember the last time I failed to finish a book. Even with the worst of plotlines and/or writing styles I usually stick it out until the end. I closed this book after 50 pages and am not going to try again. The narration suffers from too many speakers and no way to identify them. Is the rebelious priest having an affair with the wife of a wealthy art patron? Or was that the journalist speaking? Who was looking for stolen church artifacts in the restaurant district? The book had some wonderfully written passages - but these don't count for much if the author refuses to let you know WHO IS SPEAKING!!!! I love a book that challenges your intellect, but this book was ridiculously difficult - if you make your readers work that hard, you're going to lose a lot of them."
2,"Much style, little substance","I daresay that if a writer of lesser credentials than Doctorow had submitted this manuscript to an agent/publisher it would have ended up in the slush pile of unacceptable material. If the book jacket hadn't mentioned that the novel is actually a workbook of a New York City novelist recording ""The contents of his teeming brain - sketches for stories, accounts of his love affairs...etc"" I would have had absolutely no idea what the book was about. The text itself gives no clues. It is 272 pages of style and very little substance. Because it was by Doctorow, one of my favorite authors, I slogged my way through the entire book, and I will admit there were moments of brilliant writing. But too few and far between. Not my cup of tea."
2,Rave reviews???,"Someone asked, ""Why all the rave reviews?"" Because no critic had the courage to offer less than rave. Critics are cult members and they must remain loyal to the cult.About the book: unnecessarily disjointed and confusing, self-indulgent, but an interesting commentary on the state of post-modern religion."
1,Boring! Boring! Boring!,"The premise of the book has great potential, especially as we enter the Millennium. The writing style, however, is difficult, and the action crawls along. While I read most books within a week, I found this one to be lugubrious, confusing, and not at all interesting.Most of the characters never truly develop and the author gives each one an attitude of indifference toward what is going on. Needless to say, I was greatly disappointed."
3,Hopelessness,"It felt so hopeless, altho you know that ultimately something positive will happen. I understand it was her first novel. One can make excuses."
2,Mediocre read.,"I could not bring myself to finish this book. Poorly written and dull. The story does not make much sense, 2 young people sent to another world to help save it by a powerful wizard. Not long after they arrive they separate, the girl becoming a guard, able to fight and kill without remorse almost instantly. ????? Terrible read. Boring. I would not recommend this book."
3,Not the best Vinge,"I am a HUGE fan of ""A Fire Upon the Deep"" and ""A Deepness in the Sky"", but this book doesn't measure up. It's got an interesting idea (if implausible), but nowhere near what Vinge came up with for his other two books.I also found the characters a bit thin. Paul, Wili, and the rest just don't seem real to me. I don't have a sense of how these people got to where they are now. So, Paul is a genius, and has something to do with the origins of the bobbles. Great, but what happened to him in the 50 years that the bobbles have been around? How did he get to where he is? Unanswered questions.Overall, I'd skip this and stick with the other two books I mentioned."
3,Not Vernors best effort,"I had high expectations after reading Deep Space. This one is a let down. The story concept had tremendous potential,but mostly was unrealized. I sense that he was in a hurry to finish this one. Many subplots could have been developed, more background story leading up to the Peace taking over, more character development, etc, etc. I expected much more."
5,The Mummy,"Anne Rice's The Mummy is based on the reawkening of Edwardian London, who later is known as the mummy called Ramses the Damned, London was cursed before he died. He drank the Elixir of life, which makes him immortal, and slaved to his love who sends him on a killing rampage. The mummy is a must for anyone who appreciates creativity and brilliance. Anne Rice fulfilles all requirements a spectator could fathum. Her brilliance is best demonstrated when she aparted the blocked buster hit the mummy, from her novel. Her creativity was best demonstrated when she preceeded to get into the antagonist's head, instead of focusing on the protagonist actions, like in the big blockbuster hit the mummy. Anne rice's The Mummy is a masterpiece that portrays exquisite imagination, brilliance, excitement, and terror. Thus, if you are one who seeks and favors these qualities in a novel, then Anne Rice's The Mummy is the book that you won't want to pass up."
4,The best Anne Rice book yet!,This was my favorite book that Anne Rice wrote. I love Ancient Egypt and the setting this book takes place in. This is a great book that makes you smile as you read it. I love Ramses's reactions to modern machines and thinking.You should definatly read this book
3,"Not her best, but still rather good","While this book was entertaining to read, it felt more like a bedtime story. I guess I was mislead when it was classified as a ""horror"" novel. I expected more horrific material, but instead I got a novel where Anne Rice spent a very good portion of the book developing the characters, and leaving the good stuff till the last 3-4 chapters of the book. I felt the book was a bit slow up until the end. The whole time while reading the book I wanted to rush and hurry through to the end in hope that things would get more exciting. However, the book was rather sensual in a dark way, very typical Anne Rice. By the end, I wished that I was Julie. There is definitely a romantic twist in it, which adds a nice touch, but not very fitting for a ""horror"" novel. All in all, I'd say it was a good novel that's worth reading, but she can and has done better. It's more of a borrow-it-from-a-library rather than buy-it-to-own-it-book (unless it's the cheaper small paperback version)."
5,Wonderful read,"At 4.5/5 stars, the Mummy stands out as one of Ms. Rice's best standalone novels, and is even better than some of her Vampire books (the later ones, anyway) The read is entertaining and the characters are fluid. Not everyone might like this book, but the descriptions have the flair Ms. Rice used to have before her novels started to go sour (around Blackwood Farm/Blood Canticle) and I definitely loved reading this book. I would give this book a perfect 5 stars if Ms. Rice had gone through with her message at the end of this book and made a sequel."
2,Predictable and cliched,"Anne Rice may have created an ingeniously imaginative world with her Vampire chronicles revolutionary with their colorfully adrogynous characters of dark sensuality and bloodlust, but she disappointingly seems to fall short of practically everything else that I have happened to read of hers. ""The Mummy or Ramses the Damned"" is a perfect example; it reads disconcertingly like a fatal collision of the Hollywood cinematic productions The Mummy and Encino Man, leaving intelligence scattered brokenly in it's ruined wake.This kitsched piece of literature is predictable and sad,and heart breakenly tragic when coming from an author easily capable of so much more than this cheesy Egyptian adventure that could easily be Brendan Frasier's next film. Also I have no clue as to why this book is constantly being refered to as packed full of egyptian history. As an avid reader of history books I felt there was frighteningly little actual history within Ramses the Damned."
5,Great Book,"Crispy new anne rice novel. haven't had a chance to read it yet, but looking forward to reading it page by page"
3,Nothing special.,"There are some decent recipes in this book, but none of them are ""knock your sock off"" wonderful. The suggestions for crusts and garnishes are very good. However, I was very disappointed with the lack of savory recipes. In addition, nearly all the recipes in the ""no bake"" section call for uncooked egg whites. This is not a good idea.A much better book is George Geary's ""125 Best Cheesecake Recipes""."
5,Excellent,"Any time one reads Alistair Horne, or listens to anything by him read by Bill Kelsey, is time well spent. To Lose a Battle is heartbreaking and fascinating.I thoroughly enjoyed reading Horne's history of the battle of Verdun. Years later I listened to it, The Kelsey reading was excellent. I have now listened to all of them, and they are all well worthwhile.Only A Savage War of Peace is a little tricky because of my unfamiliarity with Algerian names. They sound very similar and it gets confusing. Yet this is probably the most useful of his histories at the moment for seeing how we might avoid making in the Middle East the mistakes France made in Algeria."
5,nice book,My daugher-n-law is a teacher and she loved this book. Helps to occupy her students when finished with assignments. Great price.
4,More than meets the eye,"Another in the I SPY collection. This is a great book for kids and adults to share together. Who can find an item first.Some of the photographs are so monochromatic that a few items are hard to see.Still, a great way to spend some time together."
5,I Spy books are just the best...this one is no exception,Another great set of photos that will make you dizzy with the busyness of it all. Difficult and challenging as usual. It's what makes these books so unique and great. Love them all. Glad to add Fantasy to our collection.
4,A review of I Spy Fantasy,"We have numerous I Spy books, including Fantasy, Mystery, Treasure Hunt, and even Ultimate Challenger. I use these books as a great way to pass time. There are a bunch of great riddles in here, so take a good look inside Amazon's ""Search Inside"" feature to see if you can solve the first riddle (the city riddle).However, some of these riddles seem quite difficult. I think the most difficult riddle is the one on pages 14 and 15. The riddle asks you to find 26 eyes as one of the objects. It may be hard to keep track of how many eyes you have and haven't found.Otherwise, the idea is cute and there are a lot of fantasy themed riddles, including the sand castle, toy planet and candy store riddles, so I will happily give this book 4 stars."
4,"Beautiful translation, poor indexing for the kindle edition","This is a beautiful translation. Penguin does translations very well; many of my favorite translations of the classics are Penguin editions. Their Victor Hugo editions are especially good -- they capture the poetry and rhythm of the original French while providing us with fast-paced, very readable English. And as you already know, this is a compelling story and one of those must-read novels. I really enjoyed this edition.Speaking as a Kindle reader, however, I am disappointed by the complete lack of indexing. The hyperlinked Table of Contents gives you the appendices, the introduction, and the entire novel as a single link. You cannot jump to a specific chapter. There are workarounds for this (such as bookmarking the first page of each chapter), but you expect more navigability and ease of reading from a publisher of Penguin's stature."
2,DON'T BOTHER WASTING A PENNY ON THIS FILM,"Am a die hard Gary Oldman fan, watched almost all of his films available, when I ordered this I thought he would carry the movie and make it a fun experience, alas,this did not happen. He walked through the film without giving us the movie fan a performance we have come to expect from Mr. Oldman, excellence."
2,know it all?,"This book contains a great deal of commense sense information that repeats what you have probably already read in numerous other baby care books. Some of their advice also directly contradicts advice from our pediatrician. The tone of the book comes across as very ""know it all"" and I found that frustrating and condescending. Their advice is based on their experience as parents of 3 children and as parents, we all know that we all do things differently. Buy with caution, and follow the advice from your pediatrician first and foremost. Most of the rest of the advice in this book you could get by talking with your friends that have kids."
3,A little pricey for what you get...,"I purchased this stand for our 50"" Samsung. The fit is good. I do recommend using velcro to make sure the TV doesn't slip.The parts were not perfectly shaped and resulted in making it verydifficult to tighten screws. Took near 2 1/2 hours to assemble. It has a clean, neat appearance.But come on; A top, side pieces, partial back, and two peices of glass...A little over priced I think."
1,NO ROOM FOR COMPONENTS,"The product looks nice..... It is simple to put together..... The instructions were simple to follow..... But.... DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU HAVE ANY COMPONENTS OF DECENT SIZE. I barely have jammed 1 receiver, 1 dvd player, 1 laser disc player and 1 satelite receiver into this stand. Since the components hang over the edge of the glass shelves, they wobble making the items uneven. DO NOT PURCHASE UNLESS YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF SMALL COMPONENTS."
5,Adjustable DLP TV Stand for Samsung,We ordered the Samsung HL-S5087 and this stand together. The stand arrived ahead of the TV and had some damage from shipping. Called manufacturer and replacement parts were sent and arrived BEFORE the TV. Stand fits the TV perfectly and is a great looking piece. We highly recommend this product. Price was best from Amazon.
5,"Beautiful, sturdy stand--the pic doesn't doe it justice","First off, let me say that I received my package 2 days earlier than expected(always a nice way to start things). The package is heavy, so be careful if you have to move it. When I unpacked everything, all the pieces were there. The instructions are sufficient and if you have a TV that is smaller than 60"", you *will* have some pieces of wood left over, so don't worry.The lacquer finish on this wood is absolutely stunning. In the picture that is posted on Amazon, this almost looks grey instead of the glossy black that it is. I would say it took me about an hour to assemble and the stand feels very sturdy. The stand also does a good job in minimizing the amount of space it takes up. The glass is a smoke color and adds a nice touch to the overall look and feel. If you have one of the Samsung TVs for which this stand is rated, I highly suggest you pick this stand up."
2,Poor Quality,"This item has a wonderful design. However, the instructions are poor (for example, you have to flip the entire stand over between steps but they do not instruct you to do so--interpreting the pictures points this out). I was short one lock washer. One of the nuts inside the metal bar was stripped and thus non-functioning. The stand is very good looking, but whoever makes this (certainly not Samsung themselves) needs a new Quality Manager (hmmm...maybe it is time for my promotion). Maybe I'm being too harsh, but I believe I have stuck to the facts. By the way, I may be wrong, but my guess would be that the weight limit is a little underrated. Thank you."
1,"Do not buy this stand for TV's larger than 50"".","This stand was a big disappointment for my 61"" TV. It adjusts outward to accomodate a 61"" TV, but the glass shelves are designed for a 50"" setup. This leaves a gap of 5.5"" on either side which looks funny. Also, the glass shelves are too small to be really functional for anything other than a cable box. My Samsung HL-T6187S however, looks awesome."
4,Nice and sturdy,"I purchased this stand to hold my new Samsung HL-S5687 tv. The stand is very sturdy and great for handling all the random cords involved in a typical home theater setup since the back and sides are open.My Xbox 360, HDTV Cable box, audio receiver, Wii and PS2 all fit on the glass shelving. There isn't much room for anything else, though, so don't expect to hold all your DVDs in here.It's not the greatest stand ever but it was a good purchase, in my opinion. It was pretty easy to put together!"
2,"Why, oh why, didn't someone stop her from writing this whole book in second person?","Mary Karr is a fine writer and a compelling story teller. I don't know why she thought writing practically the whole book in second person was a good idea, but what amazes me is that no one else stopped her and the book went to publication this way.Maybe she was trying to portray something about the alienation of adolescence, I don't know. But in effect, it was just distracting and annoying to read.Disappointing after the brilliance of The Liar's Club."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,The playlist for this DVD was great but the recording was extremely poor. The dubbing did not go with the performance. It was just very disappointing to a true fan.
3,Nessie opposes North Sea Oil,"The second season of Tom Baker Doctor Who stories kicked off with this: the Doctor brings Sarah and Harry back to modern-day Earth as the Brigadier has summoned him using a recall device the Doctor has supplied him. And so onto the shores of Loch Ness, where a series of mysterious circumstances await them.Oil rigs have been destroyed without explanation (although the Doctor shows, by use of Plaster of Paris) that something with very big teeth is responsible. Are the stories of the Loch Ness Monster true?One of the problems with this novelisation of 'Terror of the Zygons' is that we don't get to see the excellent on-screen realisation of the Zygons (well, at least their leader, Broton). Terrance Dicks does a fair job of adapting the story, but the visuals are sadly missed. Except the Skarasen. The written version is much better than what we saw on TV!"
2,do you want to be amidala or a peach?,"i guess rubies is the company that makes this costume. my mom spent 60 bucks to get it for me and the entire jumpsuit is not just off white, it is peach. also the boot tops are brown and not tight fitting at the knee as it looks in the picture, and the belt is completely plastic and warped. the boots look more like the ones on the kid costume. i think its okay for a costume, but not worth 60 dollars. my advice, make your own costume or be arwen from lord of the rings."
3,"Fun B-movie type book, nothing more.","Wolffile brought to mind all those wonderfully cheesy movies Roger Corman and American International Pictures made, it has the same kind of simplistic yet interesting plot liberally sprinkled with sex and grue.SomeTHING (aka a Werewolf) is killing people on an isolated island of the coast of Maine. Prodigal Dr. Ian Saunders tries to get to the bottom of the mystery while falling in love with Maeve, the beautiful daughter of a wealthy summer family that has just lost its youngest child and her groom to the fanged menace.The plot moves briskly and there are some well written moments sprinkled amongst all the hammy overwriting. A tighter rewrite and this book may have been something a little better. As it is Wolffile is just a mildly entertaining rainy afternoon time waster."
3,Is good,"Well the movie is good, but it doesn't play in my dvd...thanks god it play in my Macbook.I was waiting for more content...the movie is very short."
2,Not as expected,"While the lens is very clear, it did not make any difference the the wide angle shots I needed. Could see the sides of the lens barrel when fully zoomed out. On my Sony CX160 it actually lessened the field of view."
5,Perfect!,"I cannot recommend this product enough! I bought it because I've never heard an old time radio program like they used to put on before tv existed. It was amazing how the shows could come alive in your imagination without the aid of a television screen. The actors are skilled and the sound effects are wonderful. I wish they would bring back radio shows based on the mystery shows of the past. Its perfect for me because I can crochet and keep my eyes on my work while listening to the radio mysteries. Whether you're cooking in the kitchen or driving to work, you can still be entertained with these shows!"
1,Not worth it!,"The stamper broke on the very 1st ball I tried to personalize! A little black washer fell out of mechanism, and the stamp jammed and would not stamp the golf ball."
5,Just awesome.,"We already love Robert J. Blake from his books SwiftSwiftand TogoTogo. He does a great job with dogs, cold weather, and maps. His illustrations are top notch.His work on this book is no exception. He tells the story of a dog who ran the Iditarod race -- alone.Kids love this one. It's suspenseful."
1,A NOVEL undeserving of praise of any kind.,"As I began to read this book I thought that I would get a greater insight to the Bruderhof. I was shocked at the lies, half truths, and poor writing that I found in this book. This book reminds me of a person that has a lot of unresolved bitterness in his heart."
3,FANTASIA ruined this CD for me but other artists saved it!,"As a Luther Vandross fan, I purchased this CD when I saw the artist lineup doing my favorite L. Vandross songs. I was sadly disappointed by Fantasia's contribution to this CD. All the other artists did their part with their voice style and they pulled it through. Fantasia caused me to skip the CD. I liked her while she sang on American Idol but here, like her album, she fell FLAT on her face. Her attempt to sing was so bad that it hurt my ears to try to endure linstening to her song. Aretha Frankling sounded like Arethat always soungs, Fabulous! Celine Dion's ""Dance with my father"", was a bit different arrangement than Luther Vandross' but I really enjoyed it. If you buy this CD just know there's one BAD track (Fantasia'). You'll enjoy the rest of the CD if you just skip."
2,Luther Tribute is lacking his true inspirations.,Luther Vandross was a die hard Dionne Warwick fan. She is not on this CD. Nor is Diana Ross. Pitiful compilation. Aretha sounds awful. John Legend is the only bright spot on the CD.
2,"Great singers, bad covers","First of all, everyone is entitled to their opinion. While I respect everyones take on this album, I am amazed by how varied our tastes are and by how much we vary on this album. Frankly, I didn't care for this album at all. The songs do not match the singers - with few exceptions. Angie Stone sounded great and Fantasia was good. I will say that my favorite song and rendition on this album was Celine Dion's. Yes, I am a fan of hers but I can be impartial. Her voice and style blended perfectly with the emotion of the song. Maybe because she lost her father and can show the emotional range required to be able to sing it. No one can sing it like Luther but Celine came close. Luther had a rare talent and the music industry will suffer for this loss. Overall, you can skip the album and just preview the songs and buy your favorites individually."
5,Sweet Sounds!!!,"This CD is AWESOME! The shipper is amazing, I received it sooner than I thought I would and I've been singing ever since!"
4,An All-Star Tribute To Luther.......,"When I first read the reviews I was skeptical then. When I got to the counter to purchase it then I was still skeptical for many reasons. I am not a fan of the song selection nor do I think that the artist was a good match for particular songs. Nevertheless, the cd is a good body of work. I must say that Wyclef Jean butcher ""Always & Forever"". What his did was just absolutely awful. I can even speak on it anymore. As far as Alicia Keys I wasn't sure what she was trying to do to the song, but I know what she didn't do for it......nuff said.The ones to listen to are Jamie Foxx, Elton John & Luther Vandross, Babyface, Angie Stone, Stevie & Beyonce, Usher and Areatha Franklin. Im not saying that the song matches the artists, but overall the songs are done well. I thought the tribute was really nice. My hope is that the next tribute to him will be more soulful and melodic."
3,Enjoyable but....,"I can't help but wonder why Dionne Warwick, Diana Ross, Lisa Fischer, Gladys Knight, Cheryl Lynn, even Mariah Carey are not a part of these tribute CD's for Luther Vandross. Aretha's version of ""A House Is Not A Home"" is very good here. Otherwise, there is less impressive performances to go around.My hope for the future is that there will be a REAL tribute Cd for Luther that is up to the standard that he set within his own recordings!!Try the tribute CD to Luther called ""Forever For Always For Luther"" with Lala Hathaway and Ledisi. Their versions of ""Forever For Always For Love"" and ""My Sensitivity"" are 5 Star recordings."
3,Some really great tracks!,I already knew that a tribute album was coming even before it made news. Luther Vandross was/is and incredible singer!!!For me this album has some standout selections:John Legend...one of my favorites...its like marvin Gaye sings Luther vandross...Great Job!Donna Summer...It is really the only song on this cd that lifts you up cause honestly this tribute gets really sad. very original while all the other tracks sound very much the same.If you are a fan of Luthers it will please you.
4,A tribute...not a replacement,"I listened to this CD and remembered that it is a ""tribute"" CD, not artists trying to redo or copy Mr. Luther Vandross' unique style and voice. With that in mind, I think that this CD is excellent! Aretha, Patti, John Legend, Angie Stone, Babyface did a great job paying homage to Luther vocally. Usher, Beyonce and especially Jamie surprised me - they remembered Luther but added a little of their own flavor to each song. I love it."
2,nice thought,This is a nice thought but i didn't consider this a tribute to luther it seemed like an idea that went way wrong even though luther did at some point in his career did sing all the songs on this recording but he didn't write them he paid tribute to the songs he liked and if this were a tribute then i think they should have sang all song luther wrote but it didn't happen so think of this as something of them paying tribute to some of luther favorite songs and when you look at that way you have something that is a nice listenable cd.
2,!!!!!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The effort was A+++ however the album should have not been made. Some music just should be LEFT ALONE!!!! ie...luther, Michael, Prince.....This what you call a ""catch it on the radio cd""; PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Where is it?,"I ordered this like 14 days ago, was advised it would be here by todays date... no luck! okay okay, maybe its Christmas season, maybe I am not giving it enough chance, but when you read some of the reviews, I see too many ""it never showed up""'s .... I hope mine does, this is a very hard to find cable!Corey - Maine"
3,A disapointment,"I purchased this CD based on the rave reviews written here and from what I have heard The Indulgers are a great live band. Unfortunately that doesn't come across on this CD. The mix sounds flat and the players (apart from the fiddler who is excellent) sound uninspired and bored. Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad CD it just isn't one that you want to pull out and play over and over again. There is potential here and I will probably get their second release ""Tan & Black"". But there are so many other bands working in the genre that are doing much more interesting stuff: The Killdares, Flogging Molly, Black 47, Saw Doctors, Seven Nations, Great Big Sea, The Mahones to name a few. I would recommend someone starting with those bands rather than this CD."
5,THE INDULGERS -- ON THE WAY TO THE TOP,"I recently purchased THE INDULGERS CD directly from their website.. I first heard In Like Flynn on mp3 and was so impressed I decided to buy the CD. In Like Flynn is not the only great song on the CD.. I enjoyed them all; from Ballads to jigs Damien McCarron and the Group have produced a fine product here. THE INDULGERS are definitely a group that will do well. If you enjoy Celtic music In Like Flynn is excellent choice. I enjoy a variety of Celtic musicians and have purchased CD's by Clancy Brothers, The Chieftains, Solas to list just a few."
2,Bath scene,My son doesnt find much interest in sticking stuff on the walls while taking a bath. He finds the most enjoyment in chewing on the pieces.
4,Olman as Youngman,"Oldman is the real focus of this movie for me, this must be an early film of his and he's as good in this role as he is as a more mature actor. I find him able to handle any role or character type that comes his way.Kevin Bacon is OK as the twisted son of a mother who does threapeutic abortions (pro- lifers this is not an arguement pro or con just a description of the character his mother portrays).The premise is set up pretty good and the finale' is an ironic twist that helps give the movie some further attachment to its title.I rate it 4 because there have been better performances in other films by both lead characters."
2,"Good Performances, Dumb Plot","A pompous and predictable thriller that covers all-too-familiar territory, this one is about a lawyer who helps set his client free of murder charges only to find out he was guilty of that crime and of another killing. Those who prefer smart thrillers will be disappointed, but with its occassional moments of intriguing suspense and credible performances by Oldman and Bacon, it's hard to look away."
4,Criminal Law is criminally good!,"Despite the big 80's hair this movie still holds up as a good thriller. Kevin Bacon is young, startlingly good looking and super ingratiating as a privileged yuppie in this ""did he? didn't he?"" tale of a serial killer. Gary Oldman is doing one of his first stints as an American and his accent is pretty good. For those who are fans of both actors, it's a movie worth revisiting!"
3,"Good story, but overly long.","This book would've rated higher if it hadn't been so overly verbose and repetitive. I don't agree with other reviewers of this book that the cliff-hanger ending was frustrating; I like to be left wanting more. But this story could have been about half its current length and still told exactly the same thing, but would've been more exciting and much tighter. I'm hoping the second and third volumes will either be a bit faster paced, or at least have less repetition."
2,Tough And Tasteless,"This well packaged package of beef jerky tastes relative bland and is relatively tough and chewy, I rate it below average in all categories as it is a sub-par product even when compared to commonly marketed brands such as Jack Links. I definitely will not be buying this again, very disappointed."
5,Great watch,"My wife has a very small wrist. I had ordered two watches from Amazon previously but could not adjust the bands to be small enough to fit her wrist comfortably. Returning the previous two watches to Amazon was executed in a timely, smooth manner which is always very much appreciated. This Pulsar watch fits the bill for my wife and is very attractive and small which is what she wanted."
3,A dulcimer classic,"This book is traditionally included in the purchase price of all McSpadden dulcimers. It is a traditional book with many interesting, historical pictures. The tab is easy to follow, and the songs give a good working beginning knowledge of some very well known and other not so well known tunes. The main problem is that while including examples of all tunings used in dulcimer, most of the tunings in the book (for example, Phrygian mode) are rarely if ever used in the ""real"" dulcimer world. All in all, a good first book and a good introduction to a really fantastic line of dulcimers."
2,not for music illiterate,"i have recently started playing the dulcimer, without any musical background. if you are not familar with musical notes and don't have a full grasp of how to read sheet music, this book will be difficult to follow. i ended up having to find different books that were closer to my knowledge level - which was practically zilch."
1,It will make you appreciate bad movies...,"This movie is so bad that I look forward to seeing some movies that suck now. You don't know how crappy a movie can be until you see this. Forget the James Bond spoof angle - this movie is mostly torture with a couple of funny lines in it. I think John Wardlaw went to film school and cut class... No one can act, but the script is even worse. Most of the lines you'll hear in this one are not even words, just grunts and moans. Watch this thing only if you get some sense of adventure from enduring bad films (you don't know what bad is yet)."
4,"Depraved doesn't even begin to describe serial killer, John Robinson.","This book chronicles the DEPRAVED life of serial killer John Robinson. His criminal career entailed embezzlement, fraud, deceit, and murder. Throw into this mixture involvement in kinky S & M sexual activity, and the plot grows more depraved as you read one chapter to the next.This book DOES include court proceedings and sentencing, making it a thorough true-crime story, from start to finish."
2,Misleading title - not really for ab work,I was looking for a book that targeted abdominals and instead got a plain old basic exercise book. I would have given it 1 star except the information on exercise was presented was well done.If you are looking for a basic all around book on how to start an exercise program then this is OK.If you are looking for a book that targets the abs then look elsewhere. Very disappointed.
5,My SanDisk 1 GB Extreme III SD Card,The purchase was a pleasant experience. The shipment arrived sooner than expected. The SanDisk 1 GB Extreme III SD Card works awesome. I would recommened this product to anyone using sd memory card.
5,Fascinating and humorous account!,"Mark Shand, brother of Camilla Parker Bowles, has written a short and very entertaining account of abrief sojourn by canoe upriver into the interior of New Guinea (the western portion belonging toIndonesia). Along with his two British travelling companions, he has various adventures, trades forcurious objects (including skulls), and admires the landscape, the fauna, and the tribal inhabitants.It is a wonderfully engaging book, filled with good humor."
3,Okay...,"Well, I've had one for two years, and another for a year, both by Intec. They still work fine. But the reviews here scare me. Mine have worked perfectly fine all this time... I guess I'll get a Nintendo one before the age takes effect, since I was lucky with the hardware... But crud, I saved my Pokemon XD and Colosseum on them, and you can't transfer that memory to other cards... so I'll trade the Pokemon to my GBA and start new files, I guess. Thanks for the heads up, guys."
1,not worth it,"Too basic. It only had a few problems in each area. I saw the Kaplan study guide course book. it was huge 5in thick, and full of problems with explanations.I sent it back bc I was so disappointed"
4,Unas Mezclas muy interesantes,"el escuchar este disco puede que te haga recapacitar sobre la electronica y el arte de mezclae En Realidad el Cerebro de Prodigy hace un trabajo magistral aqui, con un manejo de las tornamesas impresionante y una seleccion de temas bastante retorcidos que muchas veces los hacen sonar excelentes a pesar de muchos no ser buenos, pero el manejo de los tiempos de prodigy los hace encajar, esa es la palabra: TIEMPO, y aqui prodigy sabe cuando es el tiempo para cada cancion, muy recomendable para los fans de la electronica"
3,"Not what they used to be, but still alright.","In my opinion,The Prodigy died after their ""Music for the Jilted Generation"" CD. That was their best, by far.This new CD has 1 or 2 alright songs, but the rest are not at all what Prodigy used to sound like. Remember ""Poison"" or ""Voodoo People"", you won't find that type of power in this CD.I don't regret buying it, but it wasn't what I had expected. I was hoping for another Jilted Generation CD.3 Starz"
5,Best GBA SP case period,"I had lots of GBA stuff scatterred around. It was tough to find one place to put it all. This case is compact yet has enough space to store just about every item I've got. Felt covered walls help protect your beautiful SP from damage, with cutaways to allow easy access to the snug SP holding bays. Under the lid flap there are two pockets for large or oddly sized things, like cables. To get a sense of volume, here's what I've got in mine:2 SPs, 22 GBA games, wireless adaptor, classic GB link cable, 4-player GBA link cable, headphones adaptor and bud headphones, 5 GB games, two GB mega-memory adaptors, GBA-GC link, car charger, wall charger, and I'd probably be able to put more in it too.Case is very durable and gives a convenient way to take it with you and not forget something. Despite the use of ""gamer'z"" in the name, it's a very respectable item."
4,Game Boy Advance SP Pro Gamer's Case,"product arrived rather fast (always a good thing) & was in very fair condition for being used. it has alot of space for it's size & the aluminum construction was one of the best ideas anyone has had for these things , they are extremely durable because of the metal & can take a bit of a beating. this is a great purchase & i hope to get a second one in the near future for additional storage space (if you store GBC games in it they use up space fast due to size). 4 stars ONLY because its used but if it had been new it would get atleast a 6-9."
4,Banging!,Check it out! I used to play this cut at the end of all my clubs and it used to bang! Fools didn't want to leave until the joint went off!
3,"Interesting characters, but way too many cliches...","I mean, black leather pants are an attractive look and all, but do we REALLY have to have every guy wearing them? Yeah, yeah, I get it that Ash and Zarek and their ilk are incomprehensibly sexy, but after a while, all that black leather just kinda runs together.I'm also beginning to see a trend with the heroes always having been chained up and the hell beaten out of them when they were kids. If this had been the only DH novel I'd ever read, I probably wouldn't have noticed. SK has a great deal of talent -- fans should be sure to check out her entry in the Christmas anthology _Naughty or Nice?_ -- but I hate to see her go the way of Christine Feehan, Amanda Quick, and so many others. I know that there's a great deal of pressure to put out a lot of novels in a hurry, but it always disappoints me to see a good series derailed by too much adherence to formula.Put Ash in some garish Bermuda shorts and a Hawaiian shirt sometime. :-)"
5,"My, oh, my Zarek","This book was......amazing.It's funny, because the first Dark-Hunter book i had read was ""Kiss of the night"" (a very good book, but it unfortunately told me about Zarek and Talon's stories before i had read them so DO NOT start with this one)which made me read the rest. I like to read in order so i began reading ""Night Embrace"" (Talong's story) but i was absolutely itching to get into Zarek. He just seemed so much more interesting and deeper than Talon. And boy, did Kenyon NOT disappoint!Filled with more heartbreak than Romeo and Juliet (albeit with a happy ending) and more LOL humour than a comedy festival i was left utterly fulfilled yet wanting. Wanting to rip off Zarek's clothes that is!Truly, one of the best reading experiences i have ever had, i could not (and did not) put this book down. Read it if you love paranormal romance, hell, read it even if you don't!"
5,"Zarek, for him five stars","I can't help it I like the ultimate bad boy, and he is it. I like the contuination of greek and roman myth. I love Ash and his contuining story in the books."
5,Kenyon Fan,"This is, by far, the best of the Dark-Hunter series. It's absolutely wonderful. Kenyon writes of Zarek and Astrid's story, and she writes it so beautifully that the characters become more than just a name in a book. I couldn't put this book down. The same day I got it is the same day I finished it.I am a big fan of the Dark-Hunter series and can't wait until the one after ""Seize the Night"" comes out. I have every book of hers in the Dark-Hunter series and they are all wonderful."
3,Something was missing,"The relationship between Zarek and Astrid left something wanting. By the end I found myself skipping to the parts with Ash and Simi, because the whole dream sex thing was overdone."
5,Ultimate Dark Hunter,I don't know how best to descibe this book. My feelings ran the gamut when it came to the 4th installment in the Dark Hunter series. By far I feel that this is my favortite book. I was so touched my Zarak's story line. I found myself in tears as he relived his youth and at how he expressed himself because of it. I just couldn't put it down. A job well done by Ms. Kenyon. This is one book I will have to read again.
5,Excellent mature comic book,"A very interesting exploration of the concepts of ""hero""/""politician"" and of the subtle and not so subtle contradictions within any power structure.Also very funny!"
1,well...,i would recommend giving this book to your bitter enemies as some type of voodoo curse. if they started to read it the incredible poseurness of it would surely soundly defeat them.
5,Great deal!,"Second pair that I've owned. (accidentally dropped the first.. wouldn't believe how hard it was not to start crying) Good, smooth movement. Fits very well ergonomically into the hand. Best calipers that I've ever owned. Excellent price, too!"
4,great music....confusing mix!!!,"I really enjoyed this cd, and the tracks were pretty cool, but what made this cd ""luke-warm"" for me is the way the tracks were mixed...it seems too jumpy...it didn't flow evenly...if this was a fashion show mix, I think the models would get buggered up trying to keep in step...On the whole it is a worthwhile disc to get, instead of some of those sloppy aerobic mixed discs that claim to be fashion show cds!"
2,Interesting yet upsetting,"This was the kind of book that I enjoy reading but also feel uncomfortable while reading it. Avrum Ehrlich gives his readers a detailed history of Chabad leadership and each leaders struggles and achivements. However what I disliked about this book was Ehrlich's constant disaproval of hasidic sources claiming they are basically lies. He claims to have a purely scholarly viewpoint yet uses sources that are defectors from chabad that have a very anti-chabad view. Obviously anyone who considers any of the Chabad rebbe's as a powerful influence in their life will probabbly be disapointed in this work. It does however give a good solid history of leadership in the chabad movement. I just think there are some things in the book that go to far that only serve to cut down certain famous chabad personalities, while adding nothing to the history of the movement."
2,Could have been better.,"Pilch's book uses medical/anthropological models to explore healing in the NT. Chapter three, which contrasts modern medicine with that of the first century, is excellent. However, the book is poorly edited and includes a great deal of redundancy (could have been 50 pages shorter). Pilch's dim view of Jesus as healer is unimaginative and uninspiring."
4,"Loved Ya-Ya, Liked Little Altars not quite as much","Little Altars Everywhere pretty much takes away any sympathy you might have for the main character in Ya-Ya. I read SYYS first (even though it's the second book) and came away with the feeling that the main character was pretty self-centered. After reading LAE, I revised my opinion downward. Both books were good reads, though."
3,"Southern dysfunction of the past, I hope!","I read these books in reverse order which I do not recommend. The YaYas as teens were so much like my own years of growing up in the 40s in Alabama,it was painful. I was keenly aware of the pain behind all the hijinks and cutups and all the digressions we were put ourselves and others through to hide the pain. In Little Altars she does a wonderful job of exposing each of the characters with the paradoxes they lived with and on some level were aware of...the love that often came too late or was rebuffed; the family ties that bind though all the gothic-ness of southern family systems. I especially loved the reality of the love between the whites and the black caregivers that tied them all together in some special way. It is a way that only another southerner who has lived there would comprehend. They are good books that give another face to ""family values""."
2,"Book should be listed under the ""kooky"" category.","Kooky alright, mainly because of her, it seemed okay enough at the time, but we really did not want to know all that stuff. Way too much time thinking, journaling, etc. Kenny is an excellent songwriter and musician and has helped a lot of people through his songs, but the book is just strange."
1,The Unimaginable Life: Lessons Learned on the Path of Love,"The fact that these two people could think that their courtship and relationship so facinating that they should share it with others is truly unimaginable. I actually held on to the book for a year wanting to mail it directly back to the Loggins, but finally threw it away, not wishing to subject anyone else to the painful experience of hoping for a redeamable point - nope - just two people who find themselves and colonics fancinating. And the reviews with 5 stars - no doubt - friends and relatives trying to get the ratings up."
1,I HATED THIS BOOK!,"For a mom who HAS to work. Who has no choice but to work, this book is an insult. Let me insert here that it was written by a MAN! The book begins ""It's not easy having a working mom. Especially when she enjoys her work."" And it's all downhill from there. The mother is a WITCH! I called and read it to family and friends who were all in shock that such a book existed. Some even thought it was a joke. No, this is not a joke. It's a horrible excuse for a book and a terrible example of a working mom. I am sure that there are some mom's out there who are a living example of the witch in the book but a terrible example of what most working moms strive to be; good at there jobs and an even better mom. I paid 75 cents for the book. What a waste!"
1,"Not in my house, you don't!","Here's a good blog post on this book, written by a man, with appalling commentary on working mothers at the ""Mommin' It Up"" blog - Amazon won't let me put the URL in here but you can find it at the URL with /uncategorized/mommy-wars-storytime-edition/ if you like. I find it interesting that the Mom's job in this book is that of a Witch - which will have some people reading through the lines. [...] In short, the book seems to offer a highly negative view of having a working mom.The nutshell -- I'd steer clear of this book. If my kid came home with it from school, I would probably be in the teacher's office the next day."
2,Its OK but...,"Just like the first one, the problem is they put in a lot of footage that is NOT of the Third Reich; such as, of Japan, England, America, etc. etc....It was sort of like they did not have enough real footage, so they threw in a lot of off-topic stuff as filler.Its OK, but not truely what it pretends to be. As for the on-topic footage it has, it was great."
2,Better off reading the book - this movie was poorly made,"The music is horrible/boring, the acting and filming is poor, and it is very obvious where they used green screen effects. It's a real shame because the books about the borrowers are pretty good - I loved them when I was a kid. Also, the borrowers are supposed to be kind of a cross between mice and people - they have tails and kind of mouse-like facial features and this movie left that out so they were just tiny humans in this movie, so it didn't make sense when the mother borrower saw her first human and thought they looked ugly.Maybe Disney or Pixar will remake this someday and then it'll be good to watch, but I'd pass on this movie version - I don't think even kids would like it."
2,variable readings,"I bought this because I liked the way it looked. However, the readings can vary as much as 5-6 lbs.This decrepancy I think may be due to floor level or uneven weight distribution when standing on the pad. The 4 cornered feet design definately wiggles like an uneven table.This is the only thing I can figure might be causing such different readings."
2,Everybody yawns,"EVERYBODY WINS is a so-so drama set in a working class area of Connecticut. Based on Arthur Miller's one-act stage drama ""Some Kind of Love Story,"" this was his first screenplay since ""The Misfits.""It's only for Nolte and/or Winger fans, or maybe homesick ex-Nutmeggers (like me). Even then this one's a slog..Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(5.1) Everybody Wins (1990) - Nick Nolte/Debra Winger/Will Patton/Judith Ivey/Kathleen Wilhoite/Jack Warden"
2,Uninteresting. Not worth the money,"This book is not very interesting. It is neither a how-to about starting a business, or a my-story type book. It's somewhere in-between, and we don't get enough of either. It's not about following your dreams, either. Sometimes, though, it is a book about how to get what you want even when it seems impossible. Still, it never turns out to be all that interesting. For example, she gets the school to change their chosen paint colors. (Who cares?) Most of the book is about her business, but if I had been thinking of starting a business, she just talked me out of it. I get the imprssion that she works too much- way more than she wants, and has debt up to her eyeballs. No thanks!"
5,Great Introduction To The Russian Revolution,"This documentary contains a mix of extraordinary historical footage and well done dramatic reenactments of the Russian Revolution and the ensuing Civil War between the Reds and Whites. But with a narrative structure that is centered on the naval officers of Kronstadt, who played a vital role in the overthrow of the Romanov monarchy. But who also tried, unsucessfully, to prevent the revolution's democratic principles from disintegrating into Bolshevik tyranny.Reviewer Alfred Johnson, apparently a die hard Communist, claims this doc is told from an anarchist perspective. But this is clearly not the case. Rather the failures and brutality of Lenin and the Bolsheviks are discussed by various mainstream historians, both Russian and Western.Recommended for those who want to learn more about one of the most important events of the 20th century."
5,Magic Match Game,"The game is very enjoyable. It starts out slow but gets harder as you go. I would say that it could be enjoy by everyone.If you want to keep your mind active, this is what I would call a good mind filler. No violence or language to worry about.I would say it is a great game for anyone."
1,Amazon review issue.,Amazon has combined the reviews for two different edits of the journals of Lewis and Clark. One edited by Bernard DeVoto and one edited by John Bakeless. I read DeVoto's edit and think it is fantastic. There are numerous different versions of the Journals ranging in cost and size. It would be nice if Amazon split up the reviews for the two different edits so that people good could decide between the two. It's like having two different versions of the bible with one set of comments.
4,Brings Back Memories - This Time It's Funny!,"Ferrell does an excellent job imitating former President Bush, and doesn't pull any punches doing it. On the other hand, he doesn't beat various issues into the ground. A nice, entertaining summary of 8 not so entertaining years."
4,Will Ferrell,I got this movie for my boyfriend. He loves it! He tells all of his friends and coworkers about and he is constantly referencing it. It' actually starting to get a bit annoying. It makes fun of George W. but it also takes look into how much pressure was on him and how overwhelming it must have been to go through everything he went through during his presidency.
1,Brave and original,"Ferrell bravely steps into uncharted comedic territory, mercilessly lambasting our former President. Boldly speaking truth to former power, he becomes one of the first to imitate a politician. His entirely true characterization of this hugely popular man reminds us of darker days long gone. Now that our unemployment is out of the double digits, we are no longer tied up and Iraq and Afghanistan, government spending is under control, special interests are no longer entrenched in Washington and steering the course of our nation, and our children thrive solely on the pure mannah of Hope and Change, we can look back at these ""W"" days with a sigh of relief, knowing that today's politicians are totally on our side and our attention to their actions is not warranted in the least.Bold, brave, and original. This is comedy for the ages."
3,Ok .....,"Some good tips but learning to surf by watching a video is like learning to drive by reading a book. Save your money, buy a good surfboard and just go surf!"
1,Cheaply made,Lousy execution on applying the nonstick to the part makes these things suck! Why even bother going through the hassle...used them a couple of times trying different techniques and ended up pitching them. I did give them one star as they ARE round...that's the only thing they got right. Don't waste time/money on these. Spend a few more dollars and get ones that work.
2,"Not so ""Non Stick""","I've owned a couple of these for over a year now and was disappointed after the first couple of uses. The egg sticks to the inside of the ring and also into the groove where the hinge is. I have to use a knife while pulling up on the ring to cut the egg out while cooking. I always spray it with oil which does not seem to help. After several cleanings the non-stick surface is beginning to wear off. Now I'm back here on Amazon trying to find a set of egg rings that really are ""non-stick""."
1,Not Made Well,Coating came off on food after only a few uses even though they were coated with oil.Not worth using if you have to pick black particles off your food.
5,egg rings,"This product is exactly what I was looking for in the last three weeks. It came promply in the mail. Works great! I would recommend this product.Sincerely,Mary AnnOhio"
3,Decent all around,"these are a touch big for a single egg, and really only work if your pans are especially flat. But they are pretty good nonstick-wise (I'd still advise just a touch of butter on the inside). And the handle is nice. they're as good as they should be for the price, and better than the standard cookie cutters I was using."
4,Great ending and a great book all together.,This was the first book I have ever read by Mr. King. I was a little dissapointed. I started reading it expecting blood and gore and horrible unimagineable things. But then I put myself in some of the characters positon and found myself totaly horrified.
5,cute little wooden lemon,"This is a small, a bit larger than a ping pong ball, sized wooden lemon. It's a simple toy but lots of fun. I like that it's made in Germany with high safety standards and not in China where so many recalled toys are produced. I was surprised by the small size of the haba play foods I ordered but now I don't mind, they are small enough to fit in the little play pots and pans - something our larger play food items cannot do. The lemon is high quality, very smoothly sanded and made of a nice hardwood."
3,"Helpful for diets, but not wonderful","These have a decent amount of soy, which seems to take away the appetite edge, so they are helpful for dieting. The taste is approximately like the grocery rice crisps, but is not wonderful.....which may be a good thing. I would buy these again."
5,Still pops up in my mind after 20 years,"I've red this book about 20 years ago, knowing nothing about the Singularity or Vernor Vinge. I still think about it frequently."
1,What a POS!,"I bought this charger and noticed after awhile that it would only charge my phone part of the time, and then only when I manipulated the cord or didn't move the phone. Now, the POS doesn't even charge it at all. Stay away from this one!!!"
1,Be aware!!,Stay away from this charger and any cellphone that uses it. It's not reliable and frustrating. And you can't replace it from any T-mobile store!!
1,Dont buy this Bulova watch.,"I bought this on looks, but after only 3 weeks, the minute and hour hands dont line up or match. Then the stop watch second hand would only reset to 5 seconds after the hour, and not straight up. Since I lost my receipt, I took it to an authorized Bulova jeweler and he sent it in to Bulova. After being at Bulova for repairs for more than a week, the jeweler called them to check, and Bulova's reply was: ""We have not got to it yet as we are very busy with repairs"". What does this say about their quality? Their customer service stinks. Please dont buy this watch. Its junk."
1,Don't waste your money,"My friend has this book and I tried to make the gecko and the flower envelope. In both cases I got stuck at a certain point and just couldn't get past it. I'm not an origami expert, but I have bought and followed other origami books and always were able to complete it. It needs better pics or photos, and better directions."
4,returned,"Picture and description at the time of purchase were of ""Hood Pin Kits"". Not replacement pins; received replacement pins, good return policy; except they sent me another set of replacement pins. Returned them both; needed a full kit, bought locally."
1,Misleading photo,"There isn't a way to rank item advertising, but the photo shows 3 plums but only one is shipped. (although it did say ""plum,"" and buried deep in the product details/description is mentions that it is only a single plum) Considering the original price for this was in the $5 range (not the price currently advertised) that seems like a bit much for one single plum. If they are only going to mail one plum, they should only show one in the photograph. Pretty basic advertising.Item is fine, my child will like it, but totally not worth buying on-line and paying for shipping for this. Get it as part of a set, or better yet, buy in a brick and mortar store if you can find one that sells these."
2,"Loved it at first, then had to return it!","The same thing happened to me as another reviewer. The front wheels bent out with little weight of my 3 & 1 year old. I had to return it and the display model was the only one available. It was also bent in some of the attachments on the roof, not the best quality for the money. I would not suggest this wagon."
3,nikon 440,"compact size, good to targets, but not golf flags. Not easy to get a reading on golf flags, but if you hold steady it will scan and get a reading."
5,EXCELLENT!! Especially for twins,My 17 month old twin boys absolutely love this wagon! Their Aunt bought it for them and they love to stroll around the neighborhood. It is such a smooth ride for them and the two seatbelts are wonderful to secure them. The handle moves the wagon around with such ease and the cargo room was such a great bonus! I would recommend this wagon to anyone. My husband put it all together is less than 15 minutes with no problems at all! A great buy and I know they will love it for a long time!
5,Wagon,"The wagon was a birthday gift for my l year old grandson, everyone was very happy with it.The only problem I have is not with the product, but with the shipping charges, that will teach me to use one touch at amazon, in fact, that will teach me to use amazon."
1,Not at ALL what I thought it would be!,"I chose this CD because I wanted my little ones to be exposed to the hymns that I grew up with. What I got was a CD that sounds more like ""Rogers and Hammerstein present: Classic Hymns!"". Trumpets, flutes, piano, guitar, and who knows what other pop synth instrumentals...completely RUIN these classic songs. Why would someone feel the need to pollute such perfect a capella music with so much ditsy bubbly rubbish background music???? If you're a fan of classic hymns, AVOID this CD!! It will probably only make you angry, and will definitely disappoint."
3,Kevin,"I have been looking for a good copy of this series for about three years now. I recently ordered this set, taking a chance at having a working set of dvd's. I am very sorry to say that I made a bad choice by going with amazon.com. I have heard many good things about this web site and, like I said decided to take a chance. I got burned!!There are three dvd's that will not even play. The edges are messed up and do not let the laser track the disc. Some people might not think thats to bad. But when you pay decent money for an item from someone as respected on the internet as Amazon, it's un-profeesional."
2,No Original Soundtrack .......No Purchase,Read the title! Great series but without the CORRECT/ORIGINAL music what is the point of purchase? Its like buying a car without wheels.
5,"Not ""natural"" but very good design principles","I think the title and subtitle are not appropriate. The designs are not ""natural"", but they do exhibit good design principles. What I like about this book, over say Amano's, is that they show you how to do it. There are over 20 different layouts featured, exhibiting several different biomes. In each case, the authors show you a good photo of the finished product, then they give plan view and perspective drawings of the design elements (plants). All of the plants in the design drawings are labeled! So you can see exactly what they did. Complete specifications are also given as (DATA) too: water temp., tank dimensions, illumination stats, substrate, etc. This is an affordable book now and well worth the price."
4,"Fun, but short","It's such an awesome show that is very enjoyable to watch, but it would be nice to have more than just 10 episodes on each dvd. It'd be much better to have the entire seasons available but for the price, it's just fine."
4,I SPY #3: Hipper than Hip!,"Here's the third and final season (1967-1968) of ""I Spy"" which features a masterpiece entitled: ""Home to Judgment"", guest starring Will Geer, written by actor Robert Culp and directed by Richard Sarafian and whose Earle Hagen's music score is extraordinary. Find more important episodes as ""The Seventh Captain"" (guest starring Harold J. Stone and music by Robert Drasnin), ""Oedipus at Colonus"" (guest starring Maurice Evans), ""The Lotus Eater"", ""An American Empress"" (guest starring France Nuyen), and two terrific diehard espionage plots: ""Anyplace I Hang Myself is Home"" (guest starring Henry Silva as a Soviet mole brainwasher-psychiatrist and Denny Miller) and ""Tag, You're It"". Robert Culp carries his fancy hip sunglasses through this season..."
2,Short And To The Point,"As an Aerosmith fan, you should read the book to ""take you to the other side"" ... Cyrinda is a very F.I.N.E. person who happens to be very beautiful also. She is quite impressed with her life in the Warhol gang and a bitter person when it comes to Steven and the Boys.There are some very interesting factoids but much of the book centers on her life and how terrible she had it. I guess living with the frontman of one of the best rock bands in history is terrible.I'm sure there were in fact some hard times for Cyrinda, but all in all, us regular folk can't quite equate our lives with hers.The book doesn't show the Boys in a good light, if you're a fan you really don't want to hear that stuff. But give Cyrinda her due, she had the nerve to put her life out there for all of us to ""see"", like it or not."
1,Read Rebel Heart Instead of This ...,I love biographies about famous people but I'm sorry to report this has to be the worst one I have ever read. ... It was one of the only books I didn't even care to finish. Don't waste your money on this one - the stories are half told and the writing is contradictory and confusing throughout.
2,Rock 'n Roll Memoir Has Highs & Lows,"Cyrinda's tale of life with Steven Tyler definitely hits some lurid notes, but I do believe that anyone interested in Aerosmith should read it. I definitely do not have the same respect for Steven Tyler that I once did, due to his brutal physical and emotional abuse of her. Things seemed to go wrong almost immediately in her marriage to Steven, and didn't get much better through their nine years together. (Note that Liv was conceived by a brief fling with Bebe Buell during that time.) Hey, Steven's got it coming..."
1,loyal fan from ohio!,"I have NOT read this book, thanks to 'a reader from New York, NY', I wont have to. That is a great review and if I would have read the book, I would more than likely agree. It will be a very cold day when Cyrinda gets a dime of my money! I especially feel sorry for Mia. I think Mia is a very beautiful girl and should consider herself lucky to now be old enough to make life changing decisions and be smart enough to have a relationship with her father and have her own opinion of him. Obviously Cyrinda is bitter and is still dwelling on this failed marriage. I also agree with 'reader', get a JOB Cyrinda and leave Steven alone! Being a loyal fan, I dont find any of your attempts interesting nor amusing. Thank God Mia has her own career and can take care of herself just fine. Thanks for saving me the money 'reader'. Not that I would have bought it anyway!"
3,Good quality,"I think the seeds sold are of good quality but there's still room for improvement. Compared with leading brands like Burpee/Ferry Morse, Seeds Of India seeds do not have 100% germination so you have to be a bit lucky. Also a tip - most of these are summer crops (except for carrot, leafy veggies etc) so make sure you're growing them at the right temperature. Our turais (ridge gourd) are growing great."
1,Disappointed,"I thought this was going to be a book of funny and interesting items about the south and southerners. What it turned out to be is a text book! I tossed it into the trash, but pulled it back out so I can donate it to Goodwill."
5,"A NOP NOTCH, CLASS ACT. BETTER THAN VOLUME 1.",SAMMY GETS DOWN AND REALLY DIGS ON THIS ONE. THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE SUPERB....I REALLY LOVE THIS MAN!!
3,Alternate endings are a joke!!!,"Now don't get me wrong - I LOVE sex and the city -- I lived for this show and it's my pleasure to buy the dvd's and watch them whenever my little heart desires. However, when they break up the season on two separate box sets and promise ""three alternate endings"" and ""never before seen footage"" i'm thinking great, hours of enjoyment and when can i pre-order? However, what is really on the dvd is only THREE (yes 3) minutes of alternate endings and only one deleted scene from each of the six seasons. The bonus features are not worth the 33.00 you have to shell out to complete/start your collection. What a JOKE! save your money, get a DVR and record them from TIVO!"
4,Happy with my purchase,It was a little beat up but the DVD played fine so I was happy with my product. I'd recommend using this buyer again.
2,Part 2 of Season 6 - Major Anti-Climax,"Part 1 of Season 6 was tasteful without being contrived for a no-holds barred series featuring the occasional spattering of foul language. All the essential ingredients that made Part 1 good watching (great lines, decent character development and pacing) was sadly absent in Part 2. The supporting cast's roles were even more diminished and their storylines more farcical or hastily skimmed through. The serious chapter and verses that led to Sarah Jessica Parker's grand finale in Paris turned out to be nothing but a drag. The ""happy"" ending for Carrie and big was so formulaic and uninspiring. The haute couture was probably the only saving grace to Part 2. If you have access to the Zone 3, two parts-in-one edition, get it instead (priced US$40, sans Special Features, but who cares for the over-rated alternative endings from the over-priced (US$57.48) Zone 1, Part 1 & 2 edition)?!"
2,Feels cheaply made,"The handle mechanism is not seated properly. You can see this by looking at the picture of it. Also, the top and the hinge for the top feel cheap to me. For someone you want to buy once, buy something a little nicer, IMO. The lid ball-handle and the handle itself are plastic. Not impressed."
3,interesting but not moving,"I went into this movie with a very open mind, and personnally, due to all the reviews I read...It didnt live up to the hype. I mean lets keep it real, this movie has a NC-17 rating...I was expecting something meatier lol The end was a little too drawn out I might add"
1,A crushing bore,I got sucked in by the good reviews again. This film is a cure for insomnia. There is nothing shocking or interesting about monotone performances and a story that moves at a snail's pace. Forget it and move on.
5,"Enchanting, mystical - Irish to the core","(this is a review of the CD)What a great find. Is this really Delaney's first book? He reads the CDs and they're positively addicting. In fact, I listened to them on my daily walks and I found myself going around the loop again - not willing to leave the storyteller and Ronan and the stories and...The characters are wonderful, the legends of Ireland timeless. The story of Newgrange, the idea that poems are made from words floating in the air looking for a good home, the contest that made the Book of Kells.....as the saying goes, if these stories, myths and legends aren't real they should be!Long and intricate, the hours are well spent. If never Delaney writes another book, I owe him for writing this one, and if ever he does write another book, I'll be first in line to buy it."
4,Interesting history,Setting a novel retelling times past in the venue of a fireside chat blends recent past with distant past in a very enjoyable format.
1,Soldiers of Misfortune,"It's the mid-80s and the Outlaws get swept up in synths and drums that sound like drum machines. The songs are so lackluster I doubt that the original lineup could have saved them. This may be the absolute nadir of the Florida Guitar Army; there must have been a thousand bar bands pumping out better stuff than this in 1986.""Cold Harbor"" is a decent track, but it sounds like it should be on a CSNY album."
2,Not a good movie.,This movie was bad. But Jared Leto did a good job at acting like a crazed Beatle's fan for one hour and twenty minutes.
4,Resiliency Despite the Horror of Cancer,"This is a very insightful and eloquent tale of Dr. Mullen's struggle with cancer. At the age of 32, he finds he has a malignant tumor in his chest. He is ravaged by surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and their complications. Yet, with his inner strength and the support of friends and loved ones he goes on and ultimately embraces life again. He talks openly about the limits of the medical institution and how important the human element is to each patient."
1,Incorrect sizing information,"Item is not the dimensions described. The real dimensions are as below:* Air Filter ""Performance""* Product Series: ""Air Hog""* Height: 4.95"" (125.73mm)* Inner Diameter: 3.63"" (92.20mm)* Outer Diameter: 5.75"" (146.05mm)* Replaces OE Part#.: 25043119, 25096829, 25098632"
4,4.5,"Ya know, while listening to this cd for what seems like the millionth time, i realized that i really love it! Coming from a true metalhead prospective, i must say i dont listen to nearly anything as much as i seem to put this one on. And thats after the newest cd of theirs as well. This is filled with hook-laden metal with just enough heaviness to make it all work. And some damn good riffs as well. So i have to give it to Disturbed for making a solid disc that stands the test of time. It doesnt get the recognition it deserves as just being a solid cd. I definately disgree with some of the lame reviews. A must and a secret fave of mine!."
2,Not even close to the first,"First of all, I don't know who you guys are actually listening to, but the disturbed cd i bought blows. I thought after how hard the first cd rocked surely they improved, went harder and darker, not the case. They went soft, and even more surprising, religous? This was a bit confusing to me to say the least. Tell ya what, from a man who loves his metal, DO NOT BUY THIS CD!! Instead invest in the new Korn cd, take a look in the mirror, and see how a band improves over time and meanwhile stays hard as hell. love ya'll, gotta split."
5,7845641217987 stars,"this cd is the shizzle! its totally awesome. the by far best song on the cd is ""Liberate"" its heavy and soft and Draiman's voice is a 1 of a kind he can make such trasitions during his songs its insane he IS one of the most talented rocker vocalist or even overall vocalist out there. this cd is very meaningful and spiritual. its not something for your mothers (though my mom likes it) but it has something for almost everyone. if u liked the sickness then you should definately check this band out. they have the potential to get bigger than Metallica."
1,i wish there was a way to put zero stars,"I'm a man of few words. Disturbed is not metal anybody who says they are has no idea what metal is and probably thinks shleps like linkin park are too. Bands like these couldn't be any less metal. Now on to the album- its bad. Dave Draiman is an interesting singer but i can't stand him after a while. There are no guitar solo's and if there are its guitar noise that bands liek these try to pass off like ""oh yeah i'm being innovative i don't want to play the same stagnant stuff."" Who honestly wants to hear about Dave's mom abusing him? The same morons that thought ""daddy' by Korn was a great song. If you like this good for you i'm not trying to insult you or your tastes i'm just saying it makes oldschool metal guys like myself very angry when bands like this are put in the metal category."
1,Disturbed Sux,"This is just crappy nu-metal and nothing more. If you want to listen to a good new metal cd, try System of a Down"
2,Mostly uninspired,"I've bought and taken back ""The Sickness"" two times over. It wasn't a bad CD, but aside from the singles and ""Shout 2000"", there wasn't anything particularly interesting about the album. It's the same with ""Believe"", only the hardcore Nu-Metal has been replaced with a more melodic version. For me, this album is easily more accessible and listenable than ""The Sickness"", but there seems to be little difference in structure between the majority of the songs here. The verses are either guitar driven or low key, leading to a melodicaly screaming chorus. It is one of the few albums I would tag with the 'cookie-cutter' label. Only ""Breathe"" (on which you can hear some SOAD and Tool influence) and the ballad ""Darkness"" seem break from the norm. Not a terrible effort, but definately not classic material."
1,What a Huge Disapointment !!!,"This album has 2 good songs...Prayer and Liberate... track 1 and 2..... I dont know what happened the rest of the album, but it aint good... the first album was so much better than this one... what a shame... Maybe the next time around..."
4,"I ""BELIEVE"" this is a great CD","It took me about 4-5 listens, but I have come to the conclusion that this is a very good cd...particularily the first half of the CD. After that it becomes slightly repetious. The very last song ""Darkness"" is something new from the band...a ballad with cellos! I never expected that. It's very good and it proves David Dramain can do more than make animal noises(which he does rarely on this cd). There's no mid-point ""freak out"" like on ""Down With The Sickness"" from the 1st CD and the previously mentioned animal noises are gone except for maybe one or two songs. The lyrics are short on most songs and average but catchy at the same time(""Liberate"", ""Believe"" come to mind). Great CD. If you like ""The Sickness"" than this one will win you over. Ignore the bad reviews...they probably think Limp Biskit has talent. ha ha"
5,You got to Believe,"""Believe"" is offcourse very different from ""The Sickness"" but its still good, you can even say its better. Its different and thats why people dont like but if you really think about the difference between the two albums youll realize that if Disturbed didnt change the style of there music society would have gotten sick of them. Besides these songs have more meaning than ones on ""The Sickness"". To anyone that hasnt gotten ""Believe"" go get it and when you do the first thing you should do is put it on a cd player close youre eyes and sit back and relax.PS:to all of you take the time to listen before you start dissin'"
2,The Old Switcheroo,"Well, I have to admit that Disturbed makes some kind of innovative nu-metal. I mean nobody else does that whole bark-sing thing, do they?'Believe' had better lyrics but worse music, whereas 'The Sickness' had better music but terrible lyrics (""maybe we can put it on credit"")."
3,Disturbingly Average,"I agree with a review a few slots down. The songs just don't have the punch of the first albumn and are almost ""boring."" The hard, quick riffs are gone, with much more of an effort made towards melody and singing. That's great and all, but not what I expected from Disturbed, nor really what I want from them. ""Liberate"" is pretty cool though, but while the first albumn was strong througout, this albumn just languishes. The last track is completely NOT metal...I would only ask why Disturbed has to follow in the path of so many others and mellow out as they progress....."
3,good but not great,"I love disturbed. they are a great band and david has such a wonderful voice. the band are incedible musicians which all combined equals a great team. i loved the sickness. it is such a killer album.this album is good but it is missing something. there are moments they shine and moments of greatness but there are also songs here that are just weak. the good outweighs the bad, of course, but this is just not a great cd. it just seems to be out there, never really screaming out and grabbing your attention. good but not great."
1,Hehehehehe...,"The guitar sounds pretty good, but this band/album can get annoying. Especially the Vocals."
2,BELIEVe,"This Cd wasnt as fun and catchy as the Sickness. Believe is an alrite CD, but its not as spectacular as it could be. The best way i can describe disturb's music is by an analogy.....What Weezer's ""Blue album"" was to ""Pinkerton,"" Disturb's ""Sickness"" is to ""Believe.""I suppose believe is more meaningful, and if you're a more lyrical, soulful person, you might enjoy Believe more."
2,"Somewhat heavy, but gets lazy as it goes on...","Disturbed still haven't released an album to live up to my expectations yet, they've still stuck to their alternative metal/radio friendly rock they seem so accustomed to. However what makes this album dissapointing is it's refusal to reivent itself and take itself to different levels. Okay sure, 'Prayer', 'Awaken', & 'Remember' might be catchy and may stick in your head for a while, but it takes more than a few good songs to make a truly memorable record."
2,Definitely not The Sickness,"This cd really let me down. I bought ""The Sickness"" and thought that it was awesome. The music was hard, fast, and quite a bit angry. Also all of the songs sounded different. The only downside was that the lyrics were a bit, um...retarded (bring the violence, it's significant...)but then I got ""Believe"" and was just sad. No anger, no vocal violence- If i wanted to hear a bunch of losers doing slow songs and call it rock I'd have gotten a Creed cd. Hell, ""Prayer"" could just as easily been performed by Creed. This cd reminded me why nu-metal sucks so much. Save your $18 for a Slayer cd!"
2,ok cd,the cover is too satanic. It could have been less. the music is alright. Staind is a better group anyways.
5,This CD Rocks - Enough Said!,"Disturbed rocks - this album and the previous ""The Sickness"". OZZY AND I BOTH AGREE THAT DISTURBED IS THE FUTURE OF METAL. Those of you that like poppy 80s metal may not like this very excellent rock, but the true rockers will not be able to turn this down. Please don't base your decision on one very critical review."
3,O.K. but not great,"O.K over all. With the possible exception of the first track, none of the songs are really memorable."
3,Not the Sickness,"Flashes of greatness in no way comparable to the monstrous ""the Sickness"". First listen generates smiles but eventually becomes cumbersome and bloated. ""Liberate"" matches any of their previous work and ""Bound"" is excellent but again, not comparable to anything on ""the Sickness""....."
5,best cd of them,"After listening to all their Cds( including their last album indestructible) i can totally say this is the best Cd of them.Songs like Believe, Remember, and Darkness have so much emotion and show a softer side, the singer can totally rock it without screaming ( doesn't he?) on he other hand songs like Prayer and Liberate have strenght and power on their sounds.Buy it, good lyrics and sounds, Disturbed is a great band and this album shows their excellence."
5,Disturbed is the future of metal,"Disturbed has always been my favorite band. i was not the kid that was into rock at first but hearing disturbed's insane guitar riffs and mind blowing lyrics made me a fan. i didn't think that ""believe"" was going to be as good as ""the sickness"" but upon buying it i was blown away. the first song ""prayer"" which had been leaked like in june of last year was easily became my favorite song. I saw Disturbed at halloweenie roast in october and nearly passed out from dehydration in the mosh pits. i was just stuck to dave draiman's killer voice. i would recommend<- (spelled that wrong) this album to anyone and everyone who is inot the nu-metal scene"
3,Take More Time!,"Disturbed is known for their hard-hitting songs that happen to also be catchy. Not with Believe. Don't get me wrong, I love Disturbed, but what were they thinking? The first half is good, Sickness quality even, but the second half is one of the most awful hunks of [music]I have ever heard. Please take more time writing a CD before releasing it."
1,didnt like it,"thought it was horrible. god, the guy who sings has the [worst] voice ever! whiny, like he hasnt hit puberty yet. thats all"
1,garbage,"After makeing a heavy cd like Sickness they release this garbage. They are becoming the next Staind, How you ask? Its simple they release this heavy cd and then they sell out by makeing this crud. If you ask me they turned their backs on the metal heads much like every other band is now a days i have never been more dissapointed in a band then i was in disturbed when i heard this album that has 1 maybe 2 good songs on it"
1,What Happened?,"...I bought this album..., expecting relapse of 'The Sickness', but instead found something that sounds like Disturbed turned into a bunch of metal-hippies. Sure, the music is OK, but It's not aggressive, rageful, or even explicit. It's David Draiman telling his audience not to hate anyone. What ever happened to the raw emotions of the previous album? The whole album is lighter, with few ventures into the world of screaming vocals. David sings the whole time, automatically losing points in my book. I want Disturbed to come back, If you liked the Sickness, don't buy this, if you liked Cake's Comfort Eagle, buy it..."
5,A TRUE PAGE TURNER!!!,"ONCE I STARTED TO READ THIS BOOK, I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. I WAS SAD TO SEE IT END. THIS WOULD BE A GREAT MOVIE, AND I CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE NEXT ONE SHE PUBLISHES."
3,Fast-paced mystery,"This was a very fast-paced book. I will admit that the author threw in a couple unnecessary side stories, and I found myself skimming through these. I knew from the start who the bad guy was, but the story line kept me interested enough to keep going and see if they caught him."
3,A tad smaller than we had thought,"Yes, I did know it's only for one chocolate bar and did read the measurements. It's a tad over priced for the size of the toy- and it's a bit misleading to picture two chocolate bars when they are selling one. My girls do play with it all of the time- dropped it, bitten it and it's held up marvelously. No chipping, no peeling or cracking."
2,Exhaustive but boring,Probably one of the most complete information source about pinball but with far too less illustrations
1,One word: Horrid,"To prefix, I will eat almost anything, dried squid jerky, octopus served in its ink, sesame and seaweed Chinese candy (unleaded), intense ginger candy, and strange sea creatures that are squishy. Pulparindo and other Mexican salt candies must require some kind of tongue that I was not born with. It causes my brain to do flips, not comprehending what I am eating. Is it a salty snack, or is it candy? These are two worlds that should not come together. What next, pork Jolly Ranchers, or shrimp Jelly Bellies?"
3,FLY on the WALL,"This is the kind of DVD for Reality TV addicts who would like to ""eavesdrop"" on conversations between famous and notorious Reality TV personalities in a noisy restaurant in LA. I was a bit perplexed by the producer who seem to have thought that 2 boom mikes would be sufficient to record everyone's conversations clearly. Why not budget for individual lapel mikes when you KNOW you will have a lot of chatter and interruptions during the course of this get together? Sound problems aside - the comments made and questions raised by some of the previous contestants on shows like Big Brother, Real World and Survivor are interesting and insightful. It's not for repetitive viewing though."
1,Beware - pay a little more!!!,"I have always purchased Wahl clippers and decided to try Andis. Wahl's are so large and heavy. However, I can get a faster and more even cut with a pair of scissors. They are very quiet and that is because there is not enough power to cut. Go with another brand and you do get what you pay for!"
4,This is just one cheese wedge.,"Just to clarify for those who might not know, this is only one cheese wedge. It's cute and my son likes it."
1,Don't Bother,"Bought this and installed on a travel trailer. Two days later the stem broke so I bought another. Same story, a few days after installation I noticed the cheap plastic stem was bending, then it broke. Do't waste your money, this is a cheap product that jst doesn't hold up."
2,Not one of John Liu's better efforts,"Dragon Blood is a kung fu western set in America around the year 1880. The story is not even worth going over. It is all over the place. The brilliant kung fu performer Phillip Ko Fei is after super kicker John Liu, and the sheriff of the town is after both John Liu and Phillip Ko because he doesn't like Chinese people. I could put up with the bad story if the action was good, but unfortunately the action is really bad. Everyone who Liu fights has a gun, but they never pull out their guns until it's too late. It becomes repetitious to say the least.There is one scene worth watching. When Phillip Ko and John Liu have their fight, it is intense. It is about twice as good as the fight they have at the end ofMars Villa.2/5Picture quality is decent.I would have liked to have seen the movie Fighting Fist of Shanghai Joe, but this is a double-sided disc and for some reason Shanghai Joe wouldn't play on any of my DVD players or my computer. Stupid Videoasia."
5,Great!,This cable has served me well and has always been dependable and tough! it has been left in the cold and extreme hot with no problems
5,one of the best Russian artists EVER!!!!!,"Vladimir Vysotsky is amazing, all of his songs go from life to comedy............ HE IS THE BEST"
1,Fantasy fulfillment for a stalker,This book has shallowly written characters and major plot points solved by unbelievable coincidences. The good guy is a stalker and the bad guy unbelievable. The author also includes many political diatribes against anything not part of extremist right-wing America.
1,Extremely revolting!,I have read several Dean Koontz books and I can truthfully say that I have liked all of them (except maybe Fear Nothing). Then this book had to come along. First off it was way too long. Several sections could have been lopped off especially the long-winded part when Spencer was in a mad river huddled in his car. And secondly what made me squirm was towards the end when one of the characters has sex with her own father! And he likes it! This is disgusting in it's filth and beyond depraved. ...What is this world coming too?
5,One of the best books I've ever read!,"Dean Koontz, the master of suspense and science fiction, takes his writing in a new and wonderful direction. This is a chilling psychological-techno drama which will leave you shivering and shaking your head in disbelief. Man's inhumanity to man has never been more well illustrated. Koontz gets deep inside your head and heart like never before. His character descriptions are second to none. You will not want to put this book down once you start reading!"
2,Conspiracy theory,"Koontz was in full-fledged paranoid rant when he wrote this book back in the mid-90s. Everything from Waco to Ruby Ridge to black helicopters make cameos in this ""innocent man on the run from nameless government agency""-themed book. It's a lot like Sole Survivor but without the metaphysical edge.I would actually have given Dark Rivers only one star (a first for my review of Koontz books) but Dean comes up with a really creative serial killer that bumps the book up in my estimation. Like I mention in one of my other reviews, Koontz is awfully hard on artists in the plastic arts, and he continues that tradition in this book."
5,Intriguing and suspenseful!,"Very fulfilling for me. I enjoy books that combine genres ,especially hi-tech, computers,with a hint of mystery. Koontz motive of having a despairing protagatonist works well here. The main character has a chance to grow thoughout the novel. You can feel the love he has for the lady he tracks across the country. The main villain is an original and I could not wait until he got his. The female counterpoint to the villlain was also interesting. The main character reminded me of the protagonist in Watchers, the book that got me started on Koontz. I would like to see another book with the main characters"
2,Everything wed organizer is just ok,"It has good information, but if you are looking for an in-depth more complete book, this may not be the way to go."
4,Great action from a different era,"This package contains the first 5 summerslams. Great Nostalgia with past greats like Hogan, Savage, LOD and the Ultimate Warrior. I recommend this for all WWE fans."
5,secrets of the stars in the words of the stars,mitch meyerson has compiled a dream team of the best online marketers in the world today -- then let them speak in their own words of what it takes to achieve greatness and profits in the online world. every word of this book is a gem and every idea contains the key to the vault.
2,good title,"I gave this book to a friend when she had her baby. Thought the title was great and what I did read looked cute. Not super substantial for me, but other people who like light stuff, especially when you have a new born, it is perfect for."
3,I waver between three and...,"four stars for this book. I actually liked it better than ""okay"" as three stars represents but to me it's in the middle or lower middle order as I rate Brace's novels. It's well written as one would expect but there is something about the storyline that doesn't grab me for want of a better phrase. But it is Brace so it readable and as I plan to re-read Brace's novels I may come to a different conclusion after a second read but I don't think so."
2,"Chugga, chugga, bark bark, chugga...","is about all you'll be hearing on this album. This band is almost a bigger joke than Throwdown. If you take the vocals of a dog barking, typical chugga chugga riffs and a breakdown or two - you've got heavy heavy low low. This album is short and simple, which isn't always the best thing. And did I mention pretty shallow? Nothing heavy about them. Each song is about 2 minutes or less and if the low quality doesn't make you mad that you wasted your hard earned cash, then the timelength of this album will (it's about 1/3 as long as a normal cd is). DON'T BUY THIS, you'll waste your money, guaranteed. Think about the name: heavy heavy low low, probably means nothing - perhaps what a breakdown sounds like if you verbally describe it. God this cd is stupid. Save your money!"
4,Warm and relaxed,These are the warmest and relaxed readings of Mozart's horn concerti I've heard yet. I like how they present these pieces naturally and organically.My favorite still lies with Tuckwell and Marriner on EMI.
5,Excellent Book,"Travis' book is funny, sensitive, to the point and full of words of wisdom. He made me stop and think about my own life and my actions. I would recommend this book in a heartbeat. Whether you're a fan or not, Travis' book is worth reading."
2,Somewhat of A Disappointment,"Although Mr. Tritt's autobiography offers interesting insights on the life of a popular country music star, this book reads like one of those thrown-together paperback ""unautorized"" biographies of the latest flavor-of-the month (complete with several misspellings)"
2,works but DANGEROUS INGREDIENTS,"I've been using this product for about a year now and it's been effective with my diaphragm. I was reading the ingredients today and noticed it contains parabens and propylene glycol. I started using a diaphragm to stay away from things that might harm my body like birth control pills so I'm really sad to see such controversial ingredients in this product and will no longer be using!! Parabens have long been thought to interfere with hormones and possibly linked to breast cancer. **I did find a natural alternative though- Contragel!! Of course since it's all natural, it's not available in the US. I have to pay [...] to get it shipped to me but the peace of mind I get is worth it!! Contragel.com if you are interested!"
4,Good Quality,"The purpose of the tube is to give you more zoom power from farther away, though you do have to be within about ten feet of your subject (depending on you chosen lens), which is a pretty good range in my opinion. So if you're looking for an alternative to a macro lens, this is for you. It doesn't affect image quality even a little.Hope this review was helpful to you."
2,the negative reviews are telling....,"I was interested in reading this book, so I looked at all the reviews first. Most reviews are totally enthusiastic about the book and author. But there are many negative reviews too. It's very interesting to me that almost all of the negative reviews are by veteran Navy submariners, i.e., people who know what submarines are all about. Does this uniformly negative reaction by those who know, tell us something about the credibility of the book?"
5,great read,"If you like a book that's as funny as it is sad, as heartbreaking as it is heartwarming, read this one. Tragic comedy at its best. The cover is very misleading, however. I originally picked this up thinking it would be a light beach read, but the book is much more than that. I was surprised, but happily so. Highly recommended reading."
4,Automatic Golf can teach you a solid swing.,"Automatic Golf promises a lot, but it delivers a way to get an effective repeating swing. This video will teach you how to grip the club, get into the proper stance, and develop a fairly powerful repetitive swing using your legs to start your swing. The whole thing is a bit simplified, yet I have used it to improve my power and hit my woods better.The production values are pretty basic. For the lecture it's just Bob in a room with a small audience. The golf range features freeze frames and close ups. The video quality for the whole thing is not top notch, but it's good enough.Bob Mann also has a video called ""Automatic Golf: Lets get started"" that is also a good learning tool also."
2,A weak sequel to a classic novel,"Tom Godwin wrote a wonderful store about a group of humans who are dumped on a hell planet. They were expected to die, but over generations they were able to survive and thrive. This story was known as both ""The Survivors"" and ""Space Prison.""""The Space Barbarians"" is a weak sequel. The story continues with the survivors having to deal with a new threat. The humans do a number of stupid things, which adds to the ""tension."" For example the humans allow some aliens, claiming to be allies, to put a special detector on each of the survivors' space ships. It turns out each special detector has a nuclear bomb in it.If you have never read the first story, go track it down now. It is a classic.If you really enjoyed the first story, only read ""The Space Barbarians"" if you are willing to be disappointed, otherwise skip it and retain your found memories."
3,Not too great ...,"This wasn't a wonderful story. There were places where I was interested, so I continued to read. Lots of things happened but many of them were confusing to me (but then, I'm easily confused). Being a ""rake"" made the hero rather unappealing to me, too, although other stories about that type of man have been better. There were a few places where I admit to being surprised at what occurred between a man and a woman - namely, the mother of the main character. So many things happened in this book that it almost seemed as though the author wanted the heroine to experience just about eveerything possible! And it was overly dramatic at the end."
5,Lucien. Lucien. Lucien.,"I loved the lush stortelling, the vibrant characters, and the authors understanding of the gifted, yet frustrated, artist. A lovely story that I could not put down, and could not read anything else afterward for a couple of days. There is nothing quite like the redemption of a rake. Barbara Samuel has a way with words, and I left the story satisfied, yet somehow wanting more. And Charles, such a nice man. We should all know a Charles, and I hope he finds his true love real soon."
4,A Good Buy,"i am a college senior minoring in Chinese Studies. i recently bought this dictionary and it has been of great help in my mandarin class. it has everything essential in it: chinese characters, pinyin, and english/chinese translations. this dictionary also clearly explains how to look up chinese characters by using the radical (or stroke order) index. the only flaw i saw is in the english-chinese part of the dictionary. although the chinese counterparts of the english words are shown along with its different definitions, only the first translation is in pinyin. the sample sentences where the chinese words are used are no longer given its pinyin pronunciation but are instead written using chinese characters. this gave me a hard time figuring out how to use some of the chinese translations in chinese sentences. but all in all, this is a good book for both english and chinese speakers learning either chinese or english."
4,"Some were good, some were bad","I agree with what many of you are saying and that the markers are arriving dried out. I purchased 4 boxes - 2 of them were worthless - dry and left a very faint mark. The other 2 boxes were fantastic! Nice, bold, dark, and the fine tip was perfect! That is why I am giving this 4 stars.5 STARS to Amazon's customer service! They replaced the 2 boxes that were defective (arrived the next day). Unfortunately these 2 boxes were dried up as well so I am having to send them back but Amazon is making it right. Kuddos to them!1 star to Bic's Quality Control department. Bic should take some extra care in this area and hopefully they are paying attention to these reviews. We have come to expect more from a company like Bic. How sad to tarnish your reputation because your QC people aren't doing their job.Glad to know that Amazon is doing everything they can to fix the problem! They will have my business for a LONG time to come!"
5,A must have in every elementary classroom!,"I teach a children's literature class at a state university and a student shared this in class today. I was so moved by her retelling of the story and knew I must have it in my collection. Students who are struggling with reading will identify with the feelings of the main character and the relationship between the child and grandmother is magical. It reminds me of another must-have book, Thank You, Mr. Falker by Patricia Polacco."
1,"Religious, but not scientific by any means","This book is clearly incapable of fulfilling its boastful back cover promises. First of all because a truely fact-based and scientifically accurate discussion of the topic cannot be attained without a huge load of background knowledge. Secondly because the sources quoted are by no means impartial in the evolutionary debate, but, instead, similarly premised and largely lack understanding of modern science. Thirdly, one of the main arguments presented, after stating some arbitrary ""nice-to-know"" item on biological facts, that ""this cannot have come into existence by accident"". Thus, the line of argumentation is neither impartial, nor even-handed, but simply a blunt attack on science based on the absence of the will to truly deal with the topic unbiased and in greater detail.Simply disappointing."
1,DON'T UPGRADE,"I have used McAfee for several years and was a happy customer, until this release. I updated to this version, 5.13, from a 4.X version, prior to doing so I had no problems. Since upgrading to the new version I have had nothing but head aches, first came the trouble uninstalling the old version and installing this version ... the new version only partly installed and I had to manually remove all the registry entries to get the system cleaned up. Then I've experienced freezes while connected to the internet, and the problem yet to be resolved is that my system freezes when ever I try to shut down my computer. This is a VERY unstable release and I'm currently leaning towards demanding a refund and seeking a new product unless their tech support comes up with some sort of surprise fix for these problems. My suggestion, if you have a 4.0 release .. just stick with updateing the dat files DON'T upgrade to the new version."
5,A Classic with an Unusual Ending,This story has one of the best endings in literature. The surprise at the end is startling and can be confusing until you think about it for a minute and realize what has happened.
3,An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,this book really caught my attention because the way the flow of the book went was really smooth. it gets you wondering about whats going to happen next. I would recomend this book to someonewho like exciting books. the reason i choose to read this book is because after i started reading it; it started to get my attention by making you wait to what is going to happen next.
5,Fantasy novel by author of _Joy of Sex_,"Alex Comfort wrote the bestselling and oft-reprinted sex manual _The Joy of Sex_. He also tried his hand at fantasy fiction. Naturally, there are undertones of sensuality throughout this New Wave-esque story. But it is not pornographic. This book may be of interest to collectors of the quirky.From the bookflap:""Edward and Rosanna buy an antique door for their apartment, having no idea that they have purchased their passageway to another world. But when they step through the doorway, they find themselves in a place at right angles to real time, where the conventional greeting is 'have you loved well?'; where the army is a vehicle for play therapy and the real weapons are powered mandalas; where the most precious treasure is a crystal the size of a grain of sand ....He is a colonel in the Losian army, and she, a slave girl, in a place where people are only owned if they choose to be...."""
3,"Decent book, but not a great read","This book was entertaining, but ulimately got boring, and then stupification set in (both in the author, and the reader). Unlike any other fantasy book I have read in the past ten years, I didn't finish the last few chapters. Thus, although I enjoyed parts of it, I can't give it a great review, it was too formulaic.Admittedly, it is a clever idea to have the hero really be the sidekick, and he does a good job with many of the scenes. However, many of the scenes are also simply not that well written. You would be better of reading the trilogy ""Sword, Ring, Chalice"" if you want something modern, or anything from any of the old masters. Sorry, but this book really wasn't worth the time.It gets three stars for the wit it does contain, although if you don't like puns, look elsewhere."
4,A Necessary Evil?,"If you're going to play the Luclin expansion, you probably want this book. Like the original handbook, it has the new classes' spell lists, new area maps, etc.Yes, all that information is available in various places on the web. And yes, there are updates to the game over time. But the convenience of having it all in one place - especially if you're going to play a new class, new zone, etc. - is well worth it.I agree with a previous review that the biggest problem for me is that this is a just supplement (so I still need my original/Kunark guide), but it seems priced like a complete guide. Pima's having their cake and eating it, too. ;>I bought it. I'm glad I have it. And I'm sure I'll buy the new one when Planes of Power is released, too..."
3,Nice graphics but [not so nice] gameplay,"This is a must if you like EQ, the new zones are not worthit, except paludal and some other, and the new spells there.The really nice thing of this expansion is the new graphicsengine and textures.. it¡s a big change from the first eq.Aside from that, it needs a LOT of hardware resources, I havean AMD XP 1700+, geforce2 mx400 64mb and 512 DDR MB of ram andstill having trouble to play it at a decent speed in some areas,specially the bazaar and shadow haven.. when I enter bazaar I must look at the walls or floor to be able to walk faster than2 fps. As for the ram, you have the option to select whichraces you want the new textures loaded for, I wouldn't reccomendenabling them all even with 512 MB of ram.Btw, they just launched the new UI yesterday.. with the /bazaar option back, hah, don't try to run around bazaar with 300 players in ; ) (laggy to hell)Said that, I wouldn't ever miss this expansion, the new graphicsare worth it."
2,Poorest of the CCNA 4 companion guides,"This Review is being written 8-18-2007 for WAN Technologies CCNA4 Companion Guide, by Allan Reid.This textbook was the worst one of the four companion guides provided in the Cisco Academy courses for CCNA. The text does not adequately cover the topics that are in the CCNA ICND exam. There is not enough detail on the topics introduced. Neither does it cover the topics in the Cisco online Academy course. If you use this book, you can't answer the question in Cisco's own online chapter tests. For some reason, this book diverges from the online curriculum. My classmates, and the instructor, universally agreed that this book is poor.Note: CCNA Academy courses Version 3.1 use this book. The entire curriculum is rewritten, making this book obsolete, EXCEPT for Academy use, as they may still take the old CCNA exams after the announced expiration date in November of this year. The version of the CCNA course being taught varies by Academy during this transition time."
1,Beware - Low Quality and Wrong Quantity,"First of all, ""Country Life Cal-mag-zinc, 250-Count"" is not labelled correctly on the Amazon site. It is actually only 180-count, not 250.In addition, the formula has changed. It used to be made with high quality calcium citrate but now it it is made with low quality calcium carbonate derived from oyster shells. In case you did not know, you are not supposed to take calcium carbonate because it does not absorb properly and it prevents the absorption of other important nutrients.I broke the seal before reading the label, so I cannot return it. I will have to throw it away because I am afraid it could be hazardous to my health.I will never buy another product from Country Life."
4,like the capsules shape,it goes easy to my mouth :) and it has everything i need (magnesium zinc - it's good for cramps in legs)
2,Major let-down,"The concept is great -- what can be more fun than your childhood toy soldiers killing with flamethrowers, gernades, mortars, and tanks? Exactly, one would imagine that this is a great game. However, this isn't so. First off, the graphics are terrible. You can hardly make out the tan blobs to be soldiers. Second, the game is VERY short -- there are only fifteen short levels. Lastly, the player hardly ever get to use a tank or a jeep. The only reason I still play this game is when I'm playing against a friend. This game isn't worth paying more that $25 for it."
1,Was Not Allowed to Leave the Hospital With This,The nurses at the hospital would not allow me to leave the hospital using this in my carseat. They said it was unsafe.
2,Safety Concerns,"Before purchasing this item, please check with your safety services division in your state regarding the use of this product with carseats. I purchased this item with the hopes of keeping my newborn warm - but after I received it I was told by the Director of Safety Services in our state that these items compromise the integrity of the belts in the carseats. I also had a very hard time tightening the belts in the carseat because the openings for the belts did not line up well. Instead, I returned it and purchased a Kiddopotamus, which is shearling-lined and zips but fits OVER the carseat. The Bundle-Me item is perfect for strollers, but NOT for use with a carseat. While I want to keep my baby warm, I think it is MUCh more important that she be safe and secure in her seat."
2,Long Time User,"I have had this mug for a few years now and I like it better than one of my other travel mugs but unfortunately I came on this site to find myself a new mug, one that is microwavable. I like the look of this mug and the handle comes in useful. However, since it is made of metal, by the time I get to work my coffee is luke warm and quickly turns cold and I can't reheat it in the microwave for a quick warm up. Also, since it is tall and the base of this mug is very narrow, it is a little top heavy so I have had the issue of this coffee mug falling out of my car cup holder. Even though the lid is on securely and completely closed, I have still had coffee spill all over my car (floor, seats, console) when it falls out of my car cup holder just by taking a regular turn. Other issues with the base be narrow and the top being wider is that it is easy to knock over when sitting on a desk and again, even if completely closed, it spills and makes a mess."
3,"Old Root Canals, the Good, the Bad and the Ugly!","Root Canal Cover UpThis book describes in detail what can happen to older root canals, i.e. infections, degrading of the material left in the space where the root used to be... It's very thorough.If you need something else to worry about in your life, and you have root canals older than a couple of years, this is the book for you.I read it, discussed it with my dentist, and filed it on my library shelf.It is not a book I would recommend to anyone unless the person is dealing with a root canal problem."
5,A must read !!,This is a must read for anyone who has had a root canal. All dentists and doctors should also read this. It is very informative and my have saved my life.Thank you Dr. Meinig and Dr. Price for all you hard work and dedication to your field.MJ
3,Not my favourite Balogh book,"For me, this is one of my least favorite books written by Mary Balogh. It had the potential to be explosive by it felt more like a damp squid. I just didn't feel any real emotional intensity between the main characters. I think the main problem was that Nigel was too 'nice' to Cassandra. If he had forced her to be his mistress or thrown her out of the house, and then they fell in love, that would have made the story more suspenseful. As it was, it didn't make sense that he was so considerate ie waiting a year before visiting Cassandra when he had such a reason for revenge. It would have got 2 stars from me but I loved the two minor romances which redeemed the book for me."
1,I didn't even finish it.,"First, this is NOT A REGENCY ROMANCE. No regency hero ever wore high heels.=+) Second, Nigel is an unsympathetic hero-he totally manipulates Cassandra. Third, she is so naive its annoying, b/c she doesn't know that she is. Fourth, it just dragged on and on and on....get the picture? Fifth, her family were overbearing and stupid. Sixth, don't waste your time."
3,"Corny, but good.","This book was entertaining, but totally unrealistic. If you want a fun and corny romantic book...this is it. Quick read."
1,Dull,No character depth. Very flat story. Did not enjoy at all. Had to make myself finish the book. Very disappointed.
2,"Good, but not attention grabbing.",This book didn't hold my attention as other books have. Although an enjoyable read I would not count it as a favorite. Unlike past books it is not one I would read more than once.
4,First Exposure,"This was my first Karen Kay. The only romances I enjoy reading are historical romances about Native Americans, Lakota in particular. This story, unlike so many others I've read, had a lot of depth. While it was a ""love-at-first-sight"" kind of story, it wasn't predictable. I had trouble putting it down. I've already purchased the other books in her Lakota series and am anxious to continue reading. Thank you Karen, for sharing this wonderful story."
4,This was/is a very helpful book for Texas rockhounds,"This helpful book has assisted in finding very interesting samples and formations...Unfortunately, it seems the most recent addition was published in 1987...An update would be wonderful..."
1,"Dead girls don't tell lies, but their parents do.","I notice that the two positive reviews at the very top contain similar language-""if you know a teen, or love a teen...""This video, the book, and the t-shirts are all worthless, and any money you pay for them is going to help Cassie's parents profit from their daughter's death. There are better ways to get kids into Christianity than telling them lies, they'll either grow up deluded or resentful if you do.Testimony of eyewitnesses suggests that all the killers said to Cassie was ""Peekaboo"" before shooting her, while Valeen Schnurr (after she was shot) was asked if she believed in God-said yes-and was able to recover later on. That's inspirational enough, thank you, and no money goes to the vultures Cassie's parents have made themselves into. (...)"
2,Kindle format is UNREADABLE!,"If you have a Kindle I strongly suggest you avoid this book. The formatting of regular text is quite readable, but the code samples are extremely difficult (or impossible) to read.At it's worst, the code block at the beginning of chapter 5 is completely unreadable without a magnifying glass, and I have 20/20 vision!Amazon has some work to do with monospaced fonts in programming books and until those are worked out, I would strongly suggest anyone considering this book hold off on purchasing."
5,Best Python Book for Starters. Period!,"Need I say more? Mark Pilgrim might have retired from the interwebs but his work remains online and in print. While this text is available for free, online, I just bought this as a tribute to the great man who wrote this. I love Python and this book teaches the best practices, like really good.Highly recommended for novice programmers."
1,Terrible take on Americans- I hope this never really happens!,"I did not buy this movie. I got about half way through on a Directv recorded episode. It started out kind of cute with Tom Hanks stranded in the airport and in a bind. Without giving away too much, I will just say that I sincerely hope that if this happened to a real foreigner in any airport in this country, the powers that be all the way down to the janitors would not be incompetent and uncompassionate jerks like the characters in this movie. I'm guessing that something good happened at the end, but it was too oppressive to stick with it and find out. Stanley Tucci's character is unbearable, and I hope, completely unrealistic."
4,Enjoyable remake of...,"Low key comedy from Hanks /Spielberg which is really a clever remake of the Hanks / Zemeckis hit, Cast Away. Think about it:Hanks is marooned against his will in a finite geographical location - in this instance the international concourse of JFK Airport. He doesn't have anyone to talk to (can't speak English). He must rely on his wits and creativity to find food and vocation. Any number of attempts to get out of the finite geographical location are met with failure. Featuring Catherine Zeta-Jones as Wilson.Very enjoyable movie, Spielberg takes a calm hand to the tiller. Even John Williams' soundtrack is light and unobtrusive. Watch it with the whole family. We all liked it a lot."
4,HANKS IS KING OF THE ROMANTIC COMEDY!,"I really wasn't sure how Spielberg could pull this one off, it just doesn't seem possible to make a good movie out of a guy living in an airport, but he did it in what turned out to be a really good romantic comedy.At moments the film can be a little over the top, but you just have to take it for what it is, a movie.Tom Hanks has proven time and time again that he is one of the greatest actors of all time and Terminal goes to show that with the right director and an actor like Tom Hanks that any movie could be a masterpiece."
1,Never takes off,"This shows what having a Spielberg name attached to a film can mean. If anyone else made this film, it would have been laughed off the screen!! And at over 2 and one half hours!!!This film is based on an incident at a Paris airport. But putting this at a major American airport, it would never happen. Especially, post 9/11.There are just too many things that are absurd about this to list but the biggest is his constant access to restricted areas in the airport. Maybe once or twice but this movie takes place over a period of time!!!Catherine Zeta Jones is the only reason to waste your time on this...Hey, but if you want to see CZJ, then buy Chicago."
2,eh.....,"Such potential. Such huge potential. But somewhere along the line something goes pretty serisouly wrong with this movie. It's hard to put your finger on exactly what it is but my money is on the unnecessarily large number of overstaged comedic bits and subplots.And for goodness sakes, folks: This has absolutely nothing to do with U.S. immigration laws. Do a little reseacrh and read about the real thing."
3,See it for Catherine Zeta-Jones ... period,"The Terminal keeps you interested, but it's hardly Steven Spielberg's or Tom Hanks' best work. Like a fast food meal, it will satisfy you at the time, but won't leave you with much after you see it.However, there is one thing about it that will stick with you -- Catherine Zeta-Jones' beauty. Zeta-Jones has never looked this good, even when compared to eye candy roles like Zorro, Entrapment and Intolerable Cruelty. When Zeta-Jones appears on the screen, many of the people in the theater where I saw it, including me, gasped. I know, it's a very shallow reason to like a film, but honestly I think Zeta-Jones' beauty is the only thing about The Terminal that will stick with me."
3,"Tom Hanks Good, but Too Much of a Formula Picture","Summary from amazon review: ""It's Spielberg in Capra mode, spinning the featherweight tale of Victor Navorski (Hanks, giving a finely tuned performance), an Eastern European who arrives at New York's Kennedy Airport just as his (fictional) homeland has fallen to a coup, forcing him, with no valid citizenship, to take indefinite residence in the airport's expansive International Arrivals Terminal (an astonishing full-scale set that inspires Spielberg's most elegant visual strategies). Spielberg said he made this film in part to alleviate the anguish of wartime America, and his master's touch works wonders.""It's a pretty good film, but the acting supporting Hanks is so weak. It is too predictable and too much of a formula film. I enjoyed watching Hank's Russian character to see what he would do next in the airport, but the love story is weak and plot still needs some strengtening. I was a little disappointed in this picture."
2,VIKTOR GUMP,"Tom Hanks has found his nitch playing safe, unchallenging, roles as of late. So fans of movies like Forrest Gump and other cutesy-wootsey stories will not be disappointed with his performance in The Terminal. This one drags on forever, is literally dripping with sappiness and has a goofy soundtrack to match. Still, it'll appeal to those who need to get in touch with their feelings in order to feel good about themselves. Ooof!"
2,Boring,"The movie is simply boring. Hanks, as always, gives a very good, very smooth performance. THis is reallly a star actor, but one who can ACT indeed!But the history... it's boring. A good and touching ending, I agree, but boring."
5,Another brilliant Tom Hanks film,"Steven Spielberg and his casting director chose the right actor with Tom Hanks. He charmingly encompasses the character, and it gives viewers a new and unique perspective of non-English speaking citizens who are living in the United States."
3,Mediocre,"Have to throw my three in with the rest for a medicore film. The plot is contrived and yes, there is lightheartedness to it with two prominent actors, but the overall result for this reviewer was mediocre.Not every film can garner one's imagination and take the unlikely to the ""Yes, this could happen"" or allow the improbable to be overpowered by the tide of fantasy land.Sure the mutual feeling among foreigners to our land is strong and compelling, but too far fetched is how this came across. There are several fun moments and Hanks certainly is a likeable character due to his amazing versatility to play all kinds of characters, but, three stars is adequate. One can find others worthy of the additional stars."
3,"Oddball movie, decent acting but weak sub-plots","The main theme is carried through charmingly enough - Viktor stuck in NY, fallen through the cracks. Frank Dixon surely strikes a chord with every immigrant into this country - we have all met atleast one person like him in our many interactions with the INS and customs and immigration folks.The many sub-plots are implausible - for instance, if all he wanted was the autograph, why not let one of his friends get it. Or the whole amelia story - again, not well conceived.And really, Mr. Gupta from Madras (or should I say Chennai)? At least get the details right before using stereotypes."
4,Home is where the airport is.....,"If you've seen every single Spielberg film ever made, then you might find The Terminal a bit predictable in the outcome. But on the other hand, you might find this film a very enjoyable experience. It's a good-hearted comedy/drama with impressive performances from Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Diego Luna, Stanley Tucci, etc. Tom Hanks is especially good here. He captures the oblivious-turned innocent attitude almost perfectly, and he gets into character very well. Tucci is a standard cardboard cutout bad guy for most of the film, but he's not too distracting. The comedy is mostly light-hearted (no vulgar jokes or toilet humor), which I guess is appropriate for this sort of film. In the end, it's obvious that this isn't one of Spielberg's best films. But despite the fact that I'm not really a fan of his work, this is still a very good film. It has flaws, but it's very well-made in my opinion.Grade: 8.3/10"
5,"Brilliant, entertaining, funny, feel good movie!","I had completely forgotten about this movie until I saw it again recently on tv. Hanks is, of course, brilliant, and although long, the movie uses that time for the story to develop and for you to get attached to the characters as you get to know them. Victor's ingenuity surviving at the airport is fun. It's a good rainy Saturday afternoon movie that will make you smile!"
5,The Spielberg Marketing Tank Negatively Affected this One!,"The reason this movie got a bum wrap is because the marketing tank chose to preview it as a (1) love story (2) a comedy. It is neither. If your expectation was for either a love story like Sleepless in Seattle or a comedy like You've Got Mail, then you, the viewer, will be disappointed.This movie is a ""life"" piece, with a villain, a twist of fate, building friendships, learning to make lemonaide out of lemons, the kindness of strangers, achieving a dream, validating one's existence, and having a moral to the story that teaches life's lessons. This is a movie that I will watch several times, have added it to my collection and will watch for inspiration, especially when life has hit me with a blow and I need to get back up like Victor did. What a wonderful film that all ages can watch and receive benefits from. Don't pass this one up based on some ""shallow"" reviewers and self-described professional critics!"
2,This is just a film-length commercial.......,"In this day and age of Hollywood films, we have to accept the role of product placement that inhabits all major productions. Having said that, this film blows the idea so out of proportion that it is pretty much unbearable. Practically every scene that takes place in the terminal itself forces a brand name in your face and it's just a constant reminder of what remains most important in Hollywood nowadays. An argument could be made that all those stores exist in real terminals, but the way they are placed in the center of every scene just becomes too much. They include burger king, starbucks, borders books, yoshinoya, discovery channel store, and there's a few more. The best scene is one in which tom hanks is asked to do some translating for airport officials, but the story falls kind of flat and catherine zeta jones' character is pretty worthless. See it if you want, just not enough substance for me to support all that product placmement."
2,Disappointment from a huge Tom Hanks fan,"I am a huge Tom Hanks fan. Apollo 13, Saving Private Ryan, Castaway and Forrest Gump are some of my all time favorite movies. Tom Hanks is in my humble opinion our generations Jimmy Stewart. He is the consumate professional who makes you care about the character he plays with great emotive ability and a keen sense of comedic timing.Unfortunately, lately his movies have been a bit disappointing. I was really looking forward to this one, but it failed to move me in any way. The romance in the story never really cooked. His mission in the U.S. was almost an afterthought and his conflict with the terminal director seems forced and unecessary. There are some funny moments and a few touching scenes which lift the film to two stars, but I was expecting so much more from this Spielberg-Hanks collaboration."
1,Explicit lie in the product description,"I wanted to make a chain of this necklace 2 inches longer because it didn't fit, so I went to a jeweler. And to my utmost surprise the jeweler said that the metal of the chain isn't silver. I went to 2 other jewelers and they all said the same thing. So be careful, it may look great, but it isn't really what they say it is. Besides that it arrived almost 2 months later after their shipping estimate. Due to my location (Ukraine) it isn't so easy to send it back, and I can't even explain how angry and disappointed I am."
2,Dry let-down,"I was torn between giving this book two or three stars. I wanted to give it a positive review because it is obvious that the man did amazing research and he was very thorough. In that sense, he did a great job.On the other hand, I disliked it because it was dry and because he projects too much of his own political anxiety and agenda onto the game. I could have over-looked the dryness and given it a positive rating. But I can't overlook the leftist politics that simply get in the way of what would have been a good history of a great game."
2,Fun for a day or two,This game was soooo much fun for my first day. But then I just beat it in about 40 minutes. Then i beat it again. Then again. And again. And after that the game started to get a little old. To top it all off my guncon2 broke. (this was good becaue ihad a reason to send it back though) This is great though for guest. But for weely use too short.
4,Great Port of the Arcade Game,"If you're a big fan of the arcade Time Crisis 2, this PS2 port is a great addition to your collection. Unfortunately, the best part of the game, the light gun, is hard to find, but if you already have the Guncon or Guncon2 you need to get this game. The arcade mode is short but fun, and if you have two Guncons you can use the double gun mode, which is fun.In addition to the arcade mode, there are also several mini games, practice modes, a cool shooting range reminiscent of the Nintendo classic Duck Hunt, and several unlockables.I've never played this game without the Guncon, but since using the light gun is what makes the game so fun, I can't imagine it being much fun without it. Also, the two player arcade mode is pretty weak, because you end up with a screen about a quarter of the normal size. Otherwise, this is a solid light gun game."
2,"looks good, is it as good as it looks?","It is not an Ikea style Futon!So, the assembly instructions are a bit tricky, and not well described, it is actually confusing, and makes you try it yourself.The manual was missing several pages, the Right and left arms were mixed up together (mistakenly labeled) and the click-click hinges, which are the black steel supporters of the seats are a catastrophe to put in the arms.Screws were missing.After 3 hours of work and the futon is put together, and by the moment I was done, the stretcher was broken! Yes. Solid wood went broke!I consider myself average weight person, so 200lb.I will suggest other brands! (Blue and Yellow IKEA?)"
3,Not like his previous style,"I founded this book to be slightly different than the previous ones I had read from the same author. The first part is boring and slow, the second part is better. Yet I did not specially liked the story. Maybe it's more fun for men than women.The idea of mentioning Osama Bin Laden and other true facts in the story is good, although I think that here . at the end they did not really added anything to the plot."
2,Disappointing...,"After The Phantom of Manhattan Forsyth returned to his first kind of books with the Veteran and Avenger... but results are not at the same level of books from his 'first life'. The theme of this book is not so distant from ""The Dogs of war"", but the book lacks the details that made Forsyth one of my favourite authors...Simply disappointing."
5,The utmost political clarity,"Usually, I am not interested in vengeance stories, but this one is so intricate and credible that you eat it up to the end. The political background is impeccable. I am always impressed by Forsyth's understanding of politics. His one page account of the Yugoslavia drama is more accurate than anything you have read in the NYT.It is always nice to read a great thriller, but when it comes from a great brain, you certainly get more for your money."
3,Frederick Forsyth turns into John Grisham,"A little thing aside first: this is a readable book. But it ain't up to par with what I expect from FF.The story might have been interesting, if not for the fact that it feels quite contrived in parts, and the author felt the need to push some politcal agendas of his.Most irritating is the fact that the protagonist is so fricking perfect and has ALL the luck. There is not ONE serious setback for him during the whole book, and he shows not ONE real weakness, whether physical/skillwise or psychological. He can do it all, knows all the right people, and the sun always shines for him. Such a hero is boring. He dies at the end, and we barely care.As a final note: the purely technical writing style is still good if not that exciting. But when the Cold War ended, Frederick Forsyth lost his background and his touch. Read the Devils Alternative if you don't know him, and if you do, read this only if a 'light yarn' is your idea."
5,The mental side of music.,This book shows how to meld into any size of group. It shows the difference in conductors and how they come to their work. This area of music is not often talked about. It allows the musician to comes to terms with themselves and their ability to connect through music.
2,BAM! disgraces the PPG's.,"As much as I like the PPG's and an advocate for the resurrection of the Rowdyruff Boys, I'm disappointed with this game. First of all, I enjoy the fact they're finally in a 3D environment, but the story is just, well, pathetic. This is supposed to be a fighting style type game. Not the best fighting game I've seen. If BAM! wanted to make a really good fighting game with the PPG's, they should do it in the style like Capcom's Marvel vs. Capcom 2. That would really get my attention. Another thing I don't like, where are the rest of the characters? Where's the rest of the Gangreen Gang and the Rowdyruff Boys? BAM! really held out in that department. In the simulator mode, why can't you pit a PPG against another PPG? I like a little sibling rivalry. That's just stupid. If gamers like the PPG's, don't get this game. Stick to the Gameboy Color and Advance games...they're more challenging."
3,Good Read BUT.....,"My 18-year-old grandson read this book and recommended it to me. I found it to be a good, interesting, quick read. A lot of the stories were humorous and the author does a good job of describing life on an airbase in Viet Nam. However, I was disappointed and somewhat bothered by the numerous typos, misspellings and general poor grammar that occurred throughout the book. The author was an information specialist whose job was to write articles and stories for publication. Seems like he would have caught some of these errors before sending to the publisher. The occasional misspelling or typo is one thing, but it occurred often enough that I found it distracting. More than once, to understand his point, I had to re-read a sentence and substitute the correct word. Even the most inexpensive word processing software has spell check and grammar review. If you're looking for an interesting take on Viet Nam and don't mind the errors it's worth reading."
1,Over Promises and Under Delivers,"This book is full of plattitudes and short on real solutions one can put into practice in his or her life.An example, is the advise to ""Own your own business,"" which sounds good on the surface, but what about the 80% of new businesses that fail their first year? And no other direction is given regarding owning one's own business.More hyperbole and old ""country saying"" permeate the book. While these may make one ""feel good"" for a while and could provide some intrinsic motivation, any benefit is short-lived and quickly dies out once the ""feel good"" mentality wears off.The book reads like a commercial for the author's seminars and camps. If I could get people to pay me to read advertising for my business rather than me have to pay to advertise, I guess I would be a millionare also. Maybe that is the real genius of the book.My advise: Skip the book and spend the $25 on a steak dinner."
4,A Total Financial Mindset Makeover,"Want to adopt the mind set that motivates one to get out of debt, and start aquiring wealth? This is the book to do it. Like a dieter who wants to quit dieting and actually change the way they think and feel about food, Secrets of the Millionaire Mind helps you understand how to adopt a healthy way of thinking about bills, debt, and true wealth. Think you have to start making a million dollars a year to be a millionaire. Wrong! Just properly handle what you are making now, and wealth comes to you! It's not magic foofle dust, it's cold, hard economics; the kind that are never taught in average public schools throughout western culture."
3,advertising,"This book is really just some pretty basic Law of Attraction stuff, and there's an awful lot of plugging for the author's seminars. I feel like he's just about to tell me something I really want to know, and then...he says, ""if you come to one of my seminars, we'll be able to show you just how this works."" Not really worth my ten bucks. I'd rather have watched ""The Secret"" online two more times. Eker is not that inspiring an individual. Although, he IS rich. :)"
5,The Best of the Best,"I received this book the next day and I tell you I could not put it down. It is the most inspiring, the most intriquing book I have ever read. Great job on the book."
2,"Regurgitation, when not stating the obvious","I have a library of ""self help"" books that I have read through the years, and this is one that you can pass on. The author simply makes very obvious statements, inter dispersed with regurgitation of what is contained in virtually any self improvement text. A very forgettable book."
5,One of my all time favorites!,"I have read this book several times and will continue to read it again and again until it all sinks in--and all of my thoughts, feelings and desires are put into action! This reminds me of the book, The Secret, but for business minded folks! Its powerful and easy to read, in no time I was repeating the mantra of T. Harv Ecker, ""I have a millionaire mind"", only I took my new-found learnings and changed it to ""billionaire mindset"". This is the power behind the book, it helps to change your thinking. Ecker is an amazing mentor who offers some valuable insight into how the poor, the middleclass, and the rich think. Of course you may think you already know, but really you have no idea. Ecker will show you how to unlearn everything you know or ever thought about the rich and shows you how to reprogram your way of thinking. And very soon you too will have a millionaire mindset and maybe even one day a d billionaire mind!"
1,There ain't no secrets here.,"Absolutely the worst book of its kind I have ever read. It will have appeal only to those who have no understanding of the principles of money management and wealth accumulation, those who can least afford the book and the ""programs"" it advertises.The only sound bit of advice I found was on page 1, paragraph 1: ""Don't believe a word I say"". My very strong recommendation to those who have spent money on this trash (I, by the way, borrowed a copy from my local public library) is to return it to the seller and apply the refund to books by John Bogle, Warren Buffet and Benjamin Graham."
1,Motivational Gibberish 101...Come to my seminar!!!,"This book was weak!!! It's like Stuart Smalley meets Suze Orman...If you are into the whole ""motivational"" books..I guess this is ok...I felt like I was watching a Tom Vu commercial....Tap yourself on the head and say ""I am a MONEY MAGNET!!""..and half of the book he is plugging, of course, his seminars....I learned nothing from this book..expect that motivational speakers are rich..........."
5,great information!,I am truly getting a lot out of this book. He gives the groundwork for how a millionaire thinks so anyone can implement it for themselves. Its all about getting the right mindset.
4,Simple and obvious - once you read it,This is a very simple and easy book to read. It has definitely changed the way that I think. I would recommend it to anyone.Eric
5,Awesome!,This book has changed my life! I am so much more excited about the future and what I can accomplish. Thanks to this book I think much differently!!!
3,Secrets of the Millionaire Mind: Mastering the Inner Game of Wealth,This book was a good read. A very good self help book.
3,not so good as showed in the picture,"Actually, I was disappointed when I open the package, it was not so good as showed in the picture."
3,disappointingly small,"Camera barely fits, there is a pocket for extra batteries/photo cards but no room for USB cord."
4,"Nice, not exactly what I expected.","Mostly I like this case, but I do have a couple issues. First, since it was supposedly designed for small cameras like my Olympus 770SW, I don't understand why it isn't a little more form-fitting. I could have gotten a small universal case like this at any Target or Fred Meyer store-my camera practically swam in it. Second, the pockets in the front and back are open on top. At least one of the pockets should close-with velcro or a snap or something-to keep tiny things like memory cards from falling out. I also wish it had more than just a velcro flap to hold it closed. On the plus side, the neoprene is soft and cushiony, it has both a velcro belt-loop and a carrying handle, and is small enough to fit in a coat pocket. All in all it is a nice case, just not quite what I had hoped it would be."
3,Poor Stitching,"Although the design and functional aspects of this product are excellent, the first one I received had defective stitching. By defective, I mean that the velcro belt loop unraveled and pulled off within 2 hours on the first day I used it.However, Amazon promptly shipped me a replacement. Thanks!"
3,Olympus Neoprene case,Picture does not match the product… It does not belong to Olympus and does not have a logo name on the case like on the picture. It is just a case with no name on it like others on Canal Street. NY. If it’s ok with you go for it.. I would not recommend it. Low quality for the money they ask for. I’m giving three stars just for quick delivery and fast service. Thank you.
4,digital camera case,I like this case. I just wish it was a little bigger to store the charger and extra battery. The company was fast on delivery. Would order from them again.
1,Too Small,"This is a nice little case which I can use for my Canon 540, but it was packaged with my Olympus 565 UZ and it is not even close to being large enough for the camera. Works fine for a small point and shoot."
4,Really good game.,"When I poped this rental into my ps2, I was imidiatly shocked with the graphics. (OOOOHHHHH) The game play is really cool; jam packed with action scenes. The weapons are also very nice. (I love the sound of them) Although, in multiplayer mode, the fun kind of seeps out. Don't get me wrong, it is fun...but it would be a lot better if there were more than two people shooting at eachother. The only way to have more than two people gunning eachother out is if you had the connecter that allows you to insert more than just two controlers. I wish there could have been a cpu setup in multiplayer mode. Overal, this game is excellent.(Also, their mouths move to the voice acting like real people. Plus, the car driving levels are so action packed, it'll have you on the edge of your seat.)"
5,Great Game,I just had to write a review to say that I love this game. It isn't too hard to understand (which is good because if I can't pick up on a game quickly then I get frustrated and get rid of it) Although I like the N64 multiplayer better than the PS2 multiplayer overall this game is my favorite PS2 game so far. This game is a must have!!!
3,"+,-,?(What's hot, not,and strange)","+: Lots of guns and gadgets+: Splendid talking style+ and -: Evolved nicely from Goldeneye but not that much+ and -: Nice way of earning codes but aren't as cool as Goldeneye's-: Graphics don't look all that great-: It's shorter than Goldeneye?: What happened to holding two guns at once??: Why is it that when there is no use of the vehicle, the mission ends and why don't all of them be controlled manually?(Unlike Halo, where you control them yourself all the time, plus missions are far from over when you get out of them.)"
3,"Its an ok game, but this is no goldeneye.","Like Half-Life, the first player mode is fun...for a while. The secrets you unlock in this game are pathetic, and the multiplayer stinks because there are no bots. Still its good for a rental, the intense action is what kept me going... but soon I'll get tired of it and play something else."
3,Not the Best Bond,"This Bond is to say the least ""okay"". I bought it when it was new and it was fun for the few months before I bought it. It's price of 20$ is however unbeatable. But you should really dig a little deeper into your pocket and get Nightfire.First off the game is extremely generic. You have only one path to go down and I never felt lost in any way. Another thing is that the multiplayer shame the usual Bond multi-expirence. The enemies are not intelligent enough to be called Bond villans. They take forever to shoot and when they do they miss. All and all Ea Games really flunked on AUF but made up for it on Nightfire.-Alec"
2,This game would be great if you can invert view/moves.,"When I got this game it is pretty cool, but I'm use to inverting my controller, but this game does not have this choice. So I'm missing shots like crazy. It too a long time to get use to, i dont think I'm use to it yet still. so if you you use invert in all your games you maybe frustrated playing this game."
4,"the 2nd, but not best james bond game(too quick for ya?)","James Bond:Agent Under Fire was an O.K. game. The graphacs are pretty good and the weapons are great if your looking at the other james bond games. The game itself was good but was too quick and boring for me. Each level for a novice might take 13 minutes but for an expert gamer, you'll need about 1-2 hours to complete this game. The only reason I gave this game a four is because of the multiplayer mode, the new guided missiles and mini vehicles.All in all, there is only one game better than this in the james bond category, and that is Goldeneye. I had fun with this game but it was just too quick and easy"
5,James Bond 007 Agent Under Fire,"This game is so much fun. The graphics are so good, you would think you were really in the game. I love the challenges, like getting special awards for getting gold and platinum medals. The only thing is I can't find any gameshark codes for the game, and it pisses me off, but overall I rate this game with 5 stars."
3,It's no Goldeneye,"If you'd ask me, Goldeneye was the only 007 game that you could really, really enjoy. This game isn't really anything special, with a complicated storyline that would confuse younger players and some level that take 10-15 trys to beat. The controls are really good, and so are the graphics, but the fun level isn't really...fun. If you have a N64, get Goldeneye, then try this out."
3,"Fun, but gets old fast","Well, all anybody can do is compare this game to Goldeneye, which it isn't. I played Goldeneye for years, and I loved it. I have played this for about a week and I love it as well. But unfortunately, this game is already wearing thin. The levels are short, the gameplay is too easy (at least for me, others not experienced with first-person shooters might have more difficulty), and even the much-praised multiplayer gets tiresome after a while. Within 2 minutes of the first time playing the multiplayer with 3 other people, we were all killing each other at a tremendous rate. I racked up 60+ kills in a ten minute game many times. That is just dumb. Anyway, if you are new to the first-person shooters, this is a great training game, buy it. Otherwise, rent it a few times and you can beat it easily."
2,Another 007 messup..........,Graphics: 5 The graphics are in my opinion better tHAN perfect darks graphics. This game has wicked pictures and animations but is that only what counts?Gameplay:3 Gameplay is okay but when I play it on My Ps2 I keep wishing that I could hook my gc controller into it.Sound : 2 Sounds could get a bit better with some explosions and gunshots.Replay Value: The game is too short. I beat the game in less than 1 1/2 days. The levels are all very straightforward and there are hardly ever any challenges...
1,Terrible,"This is nothing compared to the other Bond games. Ever since EA took over the franchise, it has gone downhill. What's up with the guns...they fire little white streaks that move at 20 mph.The single player is bland. Everywhere you go, the game tells you exactly what to do with these big flashing green outlines.I also tried the multiplayer. Not good. I played it for a few minutes, then went back to Goldeneye. This game should have never made it to development."
2,This ain't Goldeneye,"I used to own an N64 and I'd play Goldeneye for hours at a time by myself or in the excellent multiplayer mode. As the first game on my new PS2 system, I prepared myself to be wowed by 007. And at first I was. The controls aren't as intuitive as Goldeneye, but the incredible graphics made up for that. Unfortunately, my excitement soon decayed into boredom as the inerrant auto-aim took care of all of my enemies. Run into a room, hold down ""X"" and you win. There's body armor all over the place so you can't die, and you can get shot a thousand times in the face with an automatic weapon and not even whimper. In other words, this game was no challenge at all.As for the multiplayer... possibly the worst multiplayer of any game ever. Again, the auto-aim lets you kill your friends with thoughtless ease. The only good scenario is one in which you must either protect or kill a VIP. Hours of fun in that one, though.Save your money. ..."
4,Live and Let Spy,"Agent Under Fire is not based on a James Bond movie.The game has 12 levels.Your in Hong Kong,Romainia,Switzerland,the South China Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.Your assignment is to stop Adrian Malprave from taking over the world by making a clone army.Malprave's henchmen are Carla the Jackal and Nigel Bloch.Bloch is the the perfect henchman.He is totally evil.But,Bond's face looks TERRIBLE![especially compared to Nightfire]While some missions are easy,levels like level 11:Mediterranean Crisis are hard.There are four driving missions.Two you drive, one automatic transport system,and one someone else drives for you.For levels 5-12 you need to put it on 00 Agent difficulty if you want to get a gold medal score.Gold medals unlock special rewards.Platinum medals unlock special multiplayer maps,powerups and characters. The multiplayer is okay.You can't use characters from other James Bond movies like Nightfire.This game is good but I prefer Nightfire."
4,Belt Hanger,Nothing fancy but holds a ton of belts and you don't have to take all the belts off to get to the one you want.
5,LOVED this Movie !,"I JUST LOVE THIS MOVIE!! ! I have now lost count on how many times I have watched this fabulous movie...I have loved the music for years but never had the opportunity to see the play. Doesn't matter now, I can watch this movie over and over! The three main characters are excellent, the movie was beautifully photographed and ladies, you will definitely fall in love with the ""Phantom of the Opera""....Gerard Butler! He as superb!For you guys out there...This movie will make an excellent stocking stuffer for the lady in your life!"
1,AMAZON BLEW IT!,"THE BLUE RAY IS FINE, SPECTACULAR IF YOU ARE A FAN. MY WIFE AND I CAUGHT THE PREMIERE IN DC A FEW YEARS AGO. WANTED THE BLU-RAY FOR HER FOR XMAS AND ORDERED WITH PLENTY OF TIME AND IT STILL SHOWED UP AFTER XMAS.THAT WAS UNDERSTANDABLE BUT WHEN I NOTIFIED AMAZON ABOUT (THIS WAS A XMAS PRESENT..HINT HINT) THEIR ADVICE WAS ""SEE IF IT SHOWS UP AND THEN CONTACT US!""PISS POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, NO TRACKING INFO, NO CORRESPONDENCE! LAST ORDER I MAKE FROM AMAZON!!!"
3,I love the movie...but....,"I loved this movie and it is a very worthwhile purchase, but I just expected it to contain special features and had no idea that the actual movie was the only thing on the non-special edition versions like widescreen and fullscreen. What a bummer. I know I should have looked more carefully, but why can't all of the discs have the special features to make things easier. Anyways...not a critique against the movie...just a beef with the packaging and so forth. In short, don't buy the non special edition versions because they will lack any fun features, which a grand movie like Phantom needs to include!"
5,A Movie for Everyone,"The Phantom of the Opera was an excellent film. I'm not a big fan of opera or musicals but this movie really caught my interest with the great music and singing. As soon as I finished watching it on PPV I knew I wanted my own copy. I found everything about this movie to be outstanding, including the settings, the cast, the music, the acting and much more. Another plus is it was all done without ""Adult"" language being used in every other line.Bravo for the movie The Phantom of the Opera."
1,Excrutiatingly bad vocals...,"... and that says it all. The singers are NOT professional; they bawl, blare and bleat alternately. If you are considering this purchase for the sake of music - don't go for it. You will be undergoing non-stop torture for the duration of the film!"
3,Broken case,I liked the movie but the case was unusable and since it was covered in plastic it wasn't apparent until I opened the plastic.
1,Worst Phatom they could have chosen,"Of all the singers at their disposal, the guy they chosen for Phantom sucks! He's flat and off key many times, and is just horrible. Sub par performance, plus really crappy makeup effect for the Phantom as well. Christine and Raoul are well played and are the ONLY glimmer of hope. This is a rental ~ not a purchase. It's not a movie you'll watch over and over. I've seen the play several times with many different actors from Michael Crawford to Robert Guillaume ~ and a muppet would have sung better than this clown. What a disappointment!"
5,By Far Surpasses Even the Play!!!,"I first saw the play at Her Majesty's Theater in London and then about 12 more times in the United States, mostly in New York and in Washington, DC. Obviously, I love this great play and especially its fantastic music!!! To my great pleasure, the movie is better, by far! The movie explains everything and shows so much more than the play ever could. All of the glorious music is exactly the same, but every single scene in the movie is far better than the play. Treat yourself to one of the greatest stories and music scores ever to hit the theater, and now the big screen! Buy this timeless classic and you can own it forever, to watch over and over for a lifetime of enjoyment. It is by far the very best there is! Enjoy!"
1,Poor service,"Never received. Amazon sent to wrong address and I never got any notification. Amazon really needs to work on their communication regarding PO boxes, street addresses, and how they are shipping the product so these errors get fixed. I have had four of them over the past six months!!! I have been a customer for a very long time, but hesitate to order anything further since they cannot coordinate their shipping with such a simple issue as PO boxes vs. street addresses."
4,Think Moulin Rouge.... but much better.,"I was NOT a fan of Moulin Rouge for the simple reason it was a musical and the main characters couldn't sing and the supporting cast... well, if you saw it you know.The Phantom at least has one great singer Patrick Wilson, one good singer Emmy Rossum, and one ok singer Gerard Butler. Plus the supporting cast was good. I like it visually but when I heard a song by Butler I prayed it was a song for a tenor and not a baritone. Every time Butler tried to sing in the lower ranges either he was out of tune or he was talk/singing forcefully (and neither sounded good).But over all in the end I enjoyed the movie, I just wish they would have casted the parts of the Phantom and Christine a little better. I am not blaming the actors but the casting director for either not picking the right person or for not letting the people they picked have more vocal training.But I am a sucker for this romantic musical so I will be buying it on Tuesday."
5,It's a wonderful movie!,"I have bought both of Limited Edition and Special Edition, as I like this Musical very much. The movie gives me a different view of this musical. Although both of musical and movie are the same story and same songs, there is a different present.I think none of Phantom's fans can miss this movie!"
4,Phantom of the Opera,"What a wonderful film, and how sad I am that I didn't see it on the big screen! Excellent! Gerard Butler is going to be a big star."
2,expected more,The Phantom of the OperaPlayed the DVD twice and it has a blue streak now also will pause for no reason.
4,Phantom of the Opera,"I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes musicals. The music is powerful and the movie holds you Spellbound.What Gerard Butler lacks in voice, he more than makes up for in magnetisim. Emily Rossum is both beautiful and extremely talented. A wonderful pick."
2,Phamtom of the Opera,A real let down. Insertion of extra scenes to appeal to the movie going crowd really ruined the flow and character of the piece. Especially the jarring action scenes. (Set the Paris opera on fire? Really.)
2,"Dark, bad production",I own the standard addition of the same movie and it is a great deal better quality than this wde screen format. This one is so dark that you can hardly see the faces. Details of clothing etc can not be distinguished.
5,The Best movie ever,"Hi I am a girl I just turned thirteen Jan/24/05 I loved the movie the Phantom of the opera and I am writing A book simalur to it in fact my mother tells me I talk about the movie to much and that she's never heard me talk about a movie like this one and since it was my birthday would you please kindly put on the website telling us when its coming out on dvd thank tou very muchKrystal Cleveland,ohio"
2,Mute button operational?,"Visually beautiful, but exercise your mute button finger in preparation for the Phantom's songs. The choice of Gerard Butler's incredibly grating voice for the title role is perplexing."
2,"Like watching Fabio in a 1 hour ""I can't believe it's not butter"" commercial","The images are stunning. The costumes are devine. The cast is beautiful. The music is haunting. I can't believe I used up my ""promise to see one chick flick with you"" that my husband gave me on this. How could something with so many lovely parts be so wrong? I loved the Broadway production. I own the book. But this film which I waited for with baited breath was so....... blah. Okay. If the cover on a romance novel could come to life it would be this movie. Seriously. And at the end when they pull off Eric's mask... the dude is handsome. My husband leaned over and whispered, ""Oh, no! I've got a zit! I'm hidious! Don't look at me!"" And the ending (which they had to change so people who read the book and saw the play would have something new to see) is depressing. For all of it's breathtakingly beautiful parts, the whole is a Frankenstein."
4,A wonderful event ...,"This is not just a movie, but a wonderful event. Wonderful music and cast, beautifully filmed, beautifully sung. On first viewing (in the movie theater) it seemed a bit long as it is almost non-stop music. But on second and later viewings, especially viewing the DVD at home, I think this movie grows on you even more."
1,Slowly I entered a coma,The ultimate chick flick or a cure for insomia. As you can guess this is not my cup of tea
2,Very Disappointing.,"If you are obsessed with the play and soundtrack, don't see this movie. Joel Schumacher's direction was terrible. Girard Butler, as the Phantom, is completely miscast. Minnie Driver, as Carlotta, saves the play. She is actually quite good. I had the feeling that she did not listen to the director at all and did her own thing, which worked well. Emmy Rossum is acceptable as Christine. The supporting cast is also decent. The script has several minor and major differences from the play. Those obsessed with the play and soundtrack will find even the minor changes annoying. Then again, the changes would have been acceptable if the acting and singing had been better; especially that of the Phantom who makes you cringe when he speaks or sings. Why did Andrew Lloyd Webber allow this movie to happen? whhyyy? whhyyy?"
3,this movie is for Phantom Phans who love everything Phantom,"I have a love/hate relationship with this movie - I love it because it is Phantom of the Opera and I love the scenery and the way the movie was done (I love everything Phantom); but to this day I do not think Gerard Butler was the best person for the part of the Phantom. (I'm a Butler fan too, just not with his singing). I bought the movie because I wanted it on my kindle fire. It's still a nice movie to have when you want something to watch and you only have a short time."
3,Stage is better but this Phantom is OK,"If there were no staged performance and this was all there was of Phantom, I would give it a higher rating. There are some cool scene additions, effects and edits. The acting and singing are fine. But it does not match the magic of the live stage performance."
2,Phantom,"Huge fan of Phantom of the Opera. Read the original book, have seen the show several times. The movie was an excellant TRY. I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. Don't get me wrong it was good but they took from another Phantom story line as well as the show and the original story. Do Not expect this to be like the show. It's not."
1,Poor -Unable to view,"Disappointing. This was our first purchase through amazon and unfortunately we are unable to view the movie; it comes up ""bad disc"" on all comp and players. We had thrown out the return slip for shipping and had not yet contacted amazon about an exchange. So any assistance would be appreciated to rectify this situation."
5,A Must Have !,"Thanks to someone borrowing our DVD of this movie, I needed to repurchase it new as cost effective as I could. Brand new. Arrived exactly as promised. Made my experience easy & quite enjoyable. Thanks for an outstanding job ! This one get's labelled as ""MINE"" & won't be lent out. It's been watched several times since the day it arrived, and due to the fact it's a timeless classic for our family, will be ENJOYED for many years to come.Don't hesitate to purchase. I had an excellent experience from start to finish for this one !"
5,LOVED IT!,"Guys, this isnt the stage version, watch it with an open heart. I do a lot of casting in theatre and I thought the casting for this movie was ideal. My particular favorites were the Phantom, Raoul and La Carlotta. Minnie Driver is stupendous as a diva, Gerry Butler is incredible and undeniably sensual and Raoul is just so sweet you can see how Christine was torn between the two. Give it a shot guys, its definetely worth it!!!"
5,cried my eyes out,"I love this movie, took it out of the library as a loan, first time I saw it, I cried my eyes out. It was very sad, but the movie was fantastic. After I watched it like three times, I had to get it. Lots of singing, and dancing, and the costumes were wonderful. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves, or like opera."
1,THE SUBTITLES IN SPANISH ARE INSULTS,"I have seen the play in New York and the movies is just as perfect and even more than the play the voices are awesome but the subtitles in spanish are INSULTS not only for me that thank God I'm billingual, but for Mr Andrew Lloyd.The subtitles are poetic, sound good but are not related at all with the play in english, i know a piece like this is hard to turn into spanish making it sound as beautiful as in the original language but that is something that MUST be respect.The person who translated the play should write his own musical in spanish call Triangle or something but NEVER The Phantom of the Opera.I would sell it! It might sound crazy but I am not letting the play take a new idea!!!SHAME ON YOU MR TRANSLATOR, and in the company for allowing that Crime"
5,Bravisima,"Though at times a bit more explanation would have clarified things, the beauty of the music and story overwhelmed technicalities like that. Only a truly hard heart would not find pity inside for Erik, and for Christine. If only pain had not maddened him, Raoul would never have had a chance to love her; but don't take me wrong, often times Raoul is portrayed as a wimp, a second choice. The man here is not any of that. It is a lovely story, if sad- but it's the kind of sadness that makes your soul grow larger and better."
4,Not just for children,Wow! what a funny book. The wordplay is subtle and hilarious. An excellent coffee table book for grown-ups and a fast paced tale for kids with lively illustrations and an ending that would make a nice thing to chat about with kids.
4,Lund bed cover,"Bed cover looks great, easy to install. Only complaint is the straps to buckle the cover down in open position are elastic and really stretch when you are driving in windy conditions. Would be great for city driving but I live in rural area where it gets quite windy and it doesn't seem real secure."
4,To the Limit - WMVHD disk,"I wanted to test my 1080p HDTV. Unless you have a Blue-ray, the only way to view a full HD on a 1080p TV is with a computer. This WMVHD disk plays great eventhough I only used a VGA connection (my laptop does not have a DVI connection). Resolutions and details are so life like, you have to run it to believe it. I would like to get commercial movies in this format."
5,Traditional English Carols At Their Best!,"This disc remains my favorite among numerous recordings of traditional English carols. Director Stephen Cleobury (not David Willcocks) has masterfully coaxed breathtaking performances out of his singers. I have owned a copy of the disc for years and because of damage to the track ""In the Bleak Midwinter"" I had to find another copy. Last year I was unable to locate one, but like a man possessed, I kept searching. Fortunately, some Amazon dealers have come up with some copies here. If you enjoy these old English carols, snatch this up. You will not be disappointed!For the record, I don't know where the August 1993 release date listed comes from. The CD insert lists the copyright as 1991."
2,Official Price Guide to Collector Plates,"Disappointed, Was not up to date. Did not have complete listings of series. Plates as far back as 1993 are listed as recent issue. secondary prices don't seem to be updated."
1,Book is over 10 years old,I was extremly disappointed because this book is over 10 years old so it is too outdated to find current market values of collector plates. It did contain other useful information about collecting plates so if you just want to learn about collecting plates this is a good book. However if you want to know the market values for plates you have this book is useless.
1,Get something better,"While this is cute and fun looking, that is as far as it goes. Because it is heated by a tea light candle, the flame is focused on the center of the pot. Even if I constantly stirred the chocolate, it still burned in the middle. So, I don't recommend this item."
5,OUTSTANDING!,"I just received my 3 piece bistro set (table and two chairs) and I love it! Just as the reviews I'd read stated, the set came impeccably packed, and was super-easy to unpack and set-up. Additionally, the chairs are more comfortable than I was expecting (even after reading the raves on your web site). I've been shopping for an attractive set for my patio for more than a year. After much research, I'm so glad I took the leap and ordered this set. My only question is: where can I order more of the folding chairs? I don't have a need for another table, but I'd love to get my hands on a couple more of the folding chairs."
1,SO boring COULD not finish,HOW on earth does a book like this get published? The first chapter was interesting and then after it all fell apart...so boring and had no idea what was going on...blah!
2,It didn't make sense,"I agree with some of the other reviewers who didn't like this book. In fact, I didn't finish it and I only had about 75 pages left.Too many things just didn't make sense. Why did Mack leave home? Why did his mother have the stroke? Did it have something to do with his leaving?Abby didn't seem to have any consequences for her very bad choices. And how were they so stupid as to think that a 10 year old would have a gallery art show???? And Sara and Reuben just didn't seem to have any spark.I wanted to like this book - after all, I paid good money for it but I just didn't. Save your money - if you want to read it, get it at the library and if you like it, write a review. The authors deserve to have every opinion (especially favorable) heard."
2,Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn.........,"Wow, who would of thought a book about the awesome BJORK would be dull. Instead of getting some interesting facts about Bjork, all we hear are the author's opinions over and over and over and over. It's like this, ""Yadda yadda yadda yadda yabba dabbo do!"" Boring!! Like fans don't already know how great she is. I put this book down after the first two chapters. All the information that IS in the book you can get from the Bjork webring. Don't waste your money, instead just buy the OFFICIAL BJORK book. Great stuff! heheheheh."
5,One of the best albums of 2002,"This album delivers! From the first song to the last song, its an amazing album. It has crunch in songs like 'Cut Your Ribbon', 'Red Alibi' and 'Air'. It also has deep melodic sounds in 'Collapse', 'Glasshouse Tarot' and 'Echodyne Harmonic'.This cd is a must have, your cd collection is not complete without it. You won't regret it...i promise."
3,Don't Get Me Wrong...,"...I was upset when At The Drive-In broke up and I am loving both The Mars Volta AND Sparta, but 31+ dollars for an extra song that you get on the Austere EP is a bit much. Just buy the regular Wiretap Scars and the Austere EP."
3,i made a mistake...,"i made a huge mistake with this album, i heard the demos before i heard the finished versions. if anyone else did this then i would think they would probably agree with me when i say that Jerry Finn, as he does with so many other bands, sucked the life out of this album. i like the songs, some of them i love, but none of these versions stack up to the demos, they all sound clinical and passionless in comparison. one large part of this is the damned vocal tuning Jerry Finn seems intent on putting onto EVERYTHING he records, but also it just lacks the soul that you can hear easily enough on 'austere' even. anyway, it is a good album, just don't listen to the demos if anyone offers them to you, otherwise you'll be ruined for this cd."
3,they've kept their sound,"this band has not moved from their roots)atdi(. their sound is fairly good, but nothing to be very proud of, if you are looking for president bush's ""more of the same"" look here, but id recommend you keep searching for some music that you haven't heard before in other forms(a.k.a. The Mars Volta). the borderline singing/screaming part of his voice sounds almost foreign, but the guitar is sparse enough to keep a functional sound constant and the beat makes you want to scream, in a good way."
3,Torn by The Sparrow,"The characters in the Sparrow were many, none too deep. The book hints at a higher philosophical exchange to come - the existence of God, man's monopoly of God as father, spirituality outside the bounds of Earth's atmosphere. At the end of the book, I was exhausted - waiting out the reason for Emilio's torment - only to find his story was simply a POW tale. I found John McCain's book more engaging. And that disappointed me profoundly."
4,Intriguing and compelling,"This book was recommended to me, and against my better judgement I read it. I loved it!!! It was a moving and convincing portrayal of struggles of faith. One part of my brain kept saying ""No, that couldn't happen!!"" while the other part of my brain was enthralled, saying ""I wonder what happens next"" It was a book that stayed with me and made me think a lot about my beliefs. I was convinced that the impossible was possible and that the characters were real. It is my next book club choice and I highly recommend it for a read that makes the reader disappear into the page."
2,A bit grating,"I'm really interested in how it goes; I like the high concept. But about 1/7th in I don't think I can stand to read it any more. There's a lot of poorly written attempted purple prose that is exhausting to try to read and I don't trust that it actually -means- anything. It's not like reading Virginia Woolf or something. It's like reading a fanfic. The ideas are a lot of fun, there's some good quotes, but getting through each page is hard. I don't appreciate the ""20 minutes with jerks"" opening either.While I like the idea of and wanted to read it, I do not enjoy the experience of reading it. It should have been more rigorously edited.I'm at this moment strongly considering tossing it, though if I do press on and wind up liking it, I'll revise this."
2,The Sparrow,This author has a very vivid imagination. It is a difficult book to get into until toward the end and then it holds your attention. Pretty well written. I will not read the sequel.
4,A masterful mix of medieval mysticism and science fiction,"The Sparrow is one of most inventive novels in the genre where invention is considered part of the admission fee. THe graceful intertwining of so many different threads of human existence into a seamless, gripping, gut-wrenching story. Religion, Catholicism, mysticism, biology, politics, space science, sexuality. Russell covers the entire range of the human drama."
1,Ridiculous,"I was expecting to read something like ""Contact"" by Carl Sagan. The story was always implausible, but by the midpoint of the book it because so foolish that it was pointless to continue. Forget NASA, if we make contact with aliens, lets send the Jesuits!"
1,Embarrassingly bad,"A sophomoric concept hamfistedly executed, with a cast of characters you just keep hoping will die already. Not remotely good enough to take itself as seriously as it does."
3,The Sparrow- a Jesuit in crisis,"Mary Doria Russell's The Sparrow is a captivating travelogue into the future. Her extrastellar explorers are none other than the Pope's Soldier's- the Jesuits, joined by a heterogenous band of merry men and women, inspired with the mission of responding to and communing with The Singers heard over radiowaves from the distant planet of Rahkat. She develops three-dimensional characters, providing enough back-story to make them believable, and understandable. The story evolves into the ultimate violence and human disgrace, and the crisis-of-faith plot line is depressing and cynical."
1,A Disappointment.,"At the beginning I enjoyed this book. The Sparrow is a Jesuit Sci-Fi novel and this combination is interesting. The nosedive begins when the characters easily manage to secure a live-a-board astroid (Jesuit financed) and then travel to a planet light years away. At this point, Russell asks us to believe Fate brought these friends together for this mission. This is a difficult state to reach with her heavy handed writing style. Still, I stuck with The Sparrow hoping its contrived elements were leading up to some profound religious or moral idea. Unfortunately, the ending crumbled away. I found myself reading a 21st Century author's version of the story of Lot. A version long on the misery, and very brief on the implications."
1,Bad Book,"If you like quality SF written by the likes of Gene Wolfe, Vernor Vinge, Stephen Donaldson, John Varley, C.J. Cherryh and the like, you will hate this book. The plot is a con job with an anticlimax that will leave you asking for your money back. The characters are nothing more than different names with the same voice (presumably the author's). The science is so laughable as to be distracting. Most importantly, the philosophical/religious exploration is pure sophistry. OTOH, if you are 12 years old you might really enjoy this book."
3,The Sparrow - A Long Song,"This book has been reviewed extensively by others, but I wanted to add a short note. To read a book in which the main character, Emilio Sandoz, struggles with his committment to God and catholisizm, and how these beliefs are challenged in an alien environment, was to say the least ..engaging. I wanted to like this book. Yet, as a 'moody' reader I quickly lost interest. The characters were two dimensional. The supposed 'humor' in Emilio, was lost on me. I had to persevere through the somewhat trite dialoge, to find out just what happens to our poor hero. In the end, I was disappointed."
3,Interesting idea but not well executed,"This has been on my list to read for years, and I finally picked up a copy and made my way through. The overall premise of this book was not too bad, but I ended up feeling the execution was poor. I had difficulty getting past some of the science issues. The team really seemed too unprepared for interstellar exploration. Given the amount of money involved, some of their mistakes are just not realistic. The author claimed she wanted to replicate the experiences of the Jesuits exploring the New World 300-500 years ago, but you can't really do that while also ignoring scientific advances since then. She did alot of picking and choosing of which science she would allow and which she would more or less ignore.[SPOILER ALERT]I also had issues with the more or less incidental deaths of characters. After spending chapters and chapters building these people up, they are almost all wiped out in one chapter, with very little description."
4,Terrible and Beautiful,"What is it like to be a pawn at the intersection of two disparate societies? This is first-rate fiction in which we find there is much to learn about ourselves from the ""others""."
1,I really wanted to like this book but I couldn't get there,"I decided to read the book based on the number of positive reviews but came away very disappointed. The set up took very long, nearly half the book before the main plot came into play. Yes, the characters and situation need background and set up but not that much time dedicated to back story. These pages could have been dedicated to the main plot and alien characters, with more time developing Rakhat. In fact, I unfortunately never came to care about any of the characters, even the main character.***SPOILER ALERT*** I also felt that I had read the same sort of story before in SF...one race has another race enslaved...space travellers upset the balance of power on another planet...so there was not much new SF wise. In fact, besides using an asteroid to travel the overall SF element was low. Then the final act was just too much."
1,"I must have missed something, slow, disappointing.","When I read the reviews on the book, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it and read it. Idid. This book is an example of something definately not living up to expectations. I am not a science fiction fan,( however I thought ""Legacy of Herorot"" was exceptional), and thought I'd give ""Sparrow"" a try. I found the book exceedingly slow and boring. Such a good premise and such a letdown."
4,nice utility pouch,Has many uses. I use mine to store and organize my extra Glock magazines for when I'm at the range.
1,Red logo missing,"The bag came on time; however, the red medic logo is not on the bag. I think this was the coolest part of the bag so I am returning it.... I am getting charged for the return shipping even though I explained the matter.Not sure if this is the case with all bags or if this is just a faulty product"
2,"It's not a messenger bag, it's a purse","On christmas morning, my son was disappointed to see that his messenger bag was in fact, more of a purse."
5,Just the ticket!!,"I had been looking for a quiver for the 6"" bolts for my pistol crossbow and your bag was just the ticket. Just what I was looking for to hold those 50 or more bolts I purchased for my crossbow pistol. Everything holds in the backpack that I purchased and mentioned in a previous review. Great product!!"
2,A reader from the high plains of Colorado,"The description is a little misleading. This book does have information concerning the habitats in Colorado but within easy access from Denver and Colorado Springs and, in my opinion, does not accurately represent the front range. It gives locations of where birds were spotted but as a beginning bird watcher I am more interested in identifying the birds. There are no descriptions or photos of the types of birds. There are some photos but most appear to be scenic in nature and except for the front cover photo, they're all black and white."
1,TOOOOOOOOOOOOOo shoooooort,Think i dont like dexter?! i like it but this game has only 4 levels with 2 mini games in each you could beat it less than 30 minutes . the graphics are dark and you cant see where youre going at times and bad loading times 2......
3,A bunch of Mini Games in one,"Really, the game is just a one game with 8 mini games in one. The game is alright if you like to play basic mini games and if you are fan of Dexter's Laboratory. It also includes cuts scenes that were made by Craig McCracken himself. The game is incredably short and just as easy. The only way to really have a challage is if you play another player. Yeah the game is multiplayer after you beat the game. The vocie are also the same, and the humor is also the same as the show. There is also upgrades you can get by making the blueprints come together which just gives you bonus rounds.The story is just as easy to follow as the game. Mandark breaks into Dexter's Lab and sets up a bomb. Dexter has to find Mandark and stop him. Mandark sets up many ways to slow him down. That's it. Really, if you like just easy button games and you are a fan of Dexter's Laboratory like I am...you'll find the game okay."
3,early color/good music/good dancing,its a good try for 1930//primitive color helps//the music is memorable//the dance sequences are interesting..eddie cantor is in good form///too bad the supporting cast is weak///a young betty grable is fun to see in the early musical number at the beginning of the film..even the mistake at the top where the opening fades in prematurly is forgiven
3,A futile approach,"An elusive and complex disorder is how autism is presented in this book. That's absolutely right, but I don't think this book even begins to give a clue as to the nature of autism. I think the approach has a lot to be desired: We have to assume that the nervous system evolved in order to gratify basic drives. In higher animals, basic drives are refined into complex emotions. So, what do the neurobiologists say? According to them, autism is a neurobiological problem, but not an emotional one! That's worse than just getting things bass-ackwards. It's being stubbornly reductionist and deliberately obtuse."
5,Great Messenger Bag for any anime fan,"I wanted a new bag for the new school semester, so i decided to get an anime designed bag after seeing some friends with theirs. This Hellsing bag seemed neat, so I decided to order it, and was not disappointed. The bag is large enough to hold a wide variety of items, from notebooks and games to large textbooks and school supplies. There are several individual zippered compartments total (2 inside and one in the front and back respectively), pencil and pen holders, and a drink holder on the side. The only complaint I would have is that while the bag is very sturdy and durable, the bottom is not very rigid so many of my notebooks and paperback books tend to lean sideways, but if you just want a travel bag that should not be an issue"
3,Not What I Was Hoping For,If you use the flour tortillas they are tough. If you use the corn tortillas they crack in each of the places that bend. Not like the taco shell bowls that I was hoping for.
5,Simple and easy to use,These fit normal sized torillas fairly well. They are big enough for an appetizer like a dinner salad or small taco salad. They can be used to make bowls for taco ingedients if used for a party.
2,NOT LIKE THE RESTAURANT SHELL,"THIS PRODUCT MAKES A HARD SHELL FORM LIKE A LARGE TACO CHIP. THIS DOES NOT MAKE THE PUFFY SHELL LIKE THE RESTAURANT SALAD SHELL. ""VERIFIED AMAZON PURCHASE."""
2,No,"This game is way to hard to control. Simple graphics and a weak multiplayer also plaque this game. You might try renting it, but leave it at that."
5,Our toddler loves this book!,"You have to get it with a roll of tape, cause there will be a lot ripped out of it. But that's only cause toddlers love this book. It's good read right before bed."
3,Not that impressed,"I realize that alot of BT fans might wanna smash me for this, since this seems to be a fan favorite, but for some reason I am not impressed with this album. I think some of the playing is sloppy and repetitive and there doesnt seem to be a lot of feel on this one, yet there are some good tracks on this, but I have listned numerous times, and for some reason this is the one bolt thrower CD that just doesnt do it for me"
4,Handy,"You can't beat this product for convenience and ease of use. I had a box of Bisquick but the pancake recipe called for an egg which I don't have. You add water, shake and pour into the pan. If you don't use all of it, it keeps in the refrigerator up to 3 days."
3,A bit too small,Wish it could be bigger. The space is only for a few pieces of clothes.Wanted to return it. But it is not convenient to ship back this thing.No rust so far.
5,Clothes drying rack,"This is perfect for small apartments, its a little smaller than I thought but ended up perfect for me. Made very well and compact for storage, taking up hardly any space at all."
4,Nice and useful,"Pros - easy to store, easy to handlecons - its too compact after unfolding, and cannot put larger clothes on it"
4,Lots of drying space with small footprint,"This rack has lots of drying space with a small footprint. I'm using it for cloth diapers. Does not work well for my husbands clothes - I think it would be sturdy enough for heavier items, but it just doesn't have the width for a long t shirt to be spread out. The top rack makes a flat spot that is great for drying knit baby blankets or sweaters."
5,Light weight and easy to use.,"We live in a small home and needed a compact drying rack, This is it. I can dry four large towels on it. It's small enough, to sit on the bathroom counter top so no floor space is taken up. Just what we needed."
5,PSI TCI Pro VS wood lathe,"I am a beginner on the lathe, even though I have used some in the past,I am very satisfied with this lathe. It has alot of power and the variablespeed is great. I wanted a lathe for my hobby of building model railroadbuildings etc. I bought another lathe from Sears but you could stop themotor with your hands at any speed. I sent it back. I know that I willuse this lathe for along time.James Walters"
3,Lathe:great Shipping: needs improvement,"My lathe arrived with holes in its box, lots of tape holding the box together and the packing styrofoam in lots of pieces, so that I was concerned about it's condition. Fortunately, its sturdy construction survived the shipper's handling (except for one mounting foot that I had to straighten)- I'm looking forward to many hours of turning with this machine."
4,A Gem & A Pleasure,"I recently purchased the Turncrafter Pro Variable Speed Lathe. I had an older lathe that I had inherited from my Dad but never got around to using because it was so complex with multiple pulleys and the tail stock was in need of repair. When this came I took it from the box, placed it on the stand my Dad had built, (it fit great), oh by the way I got the bed extension too. Anyway, within minutes I was practicing with the new tools my wife got me for my birthday. This little lathe will do everything I want and then some. For a hobby shop or for a medium serious non-production environment this thing will do the trick.Everything I could have hoped for at a very reasonable cost.PSI TCLPROVS Turncrafter Pro VS Variable Speed Wood Lathe"
1,Victorian Venetian Bronze Towel Ring,"I purchased two rings from BB&B online. They came from two different places. The boxes looked different but the product number was the same. The ring fell off the base of one when I was installing it and wouldn't stay on, the other ring the base was two pieces and would not secure tightly to the wall. The base on the one that the ring fell off of was one piece. I should have known these product were inferior, about two weeks ago I purchased to Delta Victorian Venetian Bronze Vanity light fixtures from Lowes and had to return to the store twice before I got a product that I could install. Delta may make great faucets, but this other venue just isn't working."
2,Don't bother if you're above a fourth-grade reading level.,"Not recommended. The information given is ridiculously basic, and can be provided in a single chapter of Seized by Eve LaPlante or Partial Seizure Disorders by Mitzi Waltz, both highly superior and actually informative books. I can't figure out if Wilner's condescending by nature, or if he's just overcompensating for the anticipated lowest common denominator.I'll give it two stars instead of one simply because someone out there may genuinely not know things this basic - but if you've been diagnosed with epilepsy, your doctor probably told you more about your disorder in the first five minutes of the appointment than you'll get in this entire book."
5,BEST CD THIS YEAR EVERY SONG IS GREAT,THESE GUYS ROCK I HOPE THERE AROUND FOR A LONG TIME BEST CD I'VE BOUGHT THIS YEAR AND I BUY ALOT!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,REAL ROCK IS BACK!!!,"ALRIGHT, REMEMBER THE DAYS OF GUNS N ROSES, MOTLEY CRUE AND OTHER ROCK BANDS? ITS BACK ITS ROCKIN ITS EXCELLENT. BUCKCHERRY IS ONE OF THE BEST BANDS TO COME IN A LONG TIME. THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD SONGS ON THIS ALBUM, I DONT KNOW WHERE TO START. LIT UP, AND FOR THE MOVIES GOTTA BE THE BEST. IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS YET, GET UP AND BUY IT!!!"
4,"surprisingly good cover, have not listened to tracks yet-",it was a good buy for the cover of the CD. HAven't listened to any tracks yet but I still whack off to it when im feeling lonely
4,A Good Debut,"The AC/DC comparisons are warranted here. Thus, my biggest problem with this album is too many songs don't go anywhere: they're altogether noisy and pointless. It's the tracks that veer from that simplistic formula - like ""Lit Up"" - which are the strongest cuts."
1,not your everyday Latin,"I bought the 2001 version so I could brush up on my high school Latin but this calendar had so many complex and classical entries, it was really useless for learning everyday-type language. One typical example for the word inimicus (enemy): ""Antonius, unus ex inimicis, iussit Ciceronem interfici et caput eius inter duas manus in rostris poni."" Which translates as ""Antonius, one of the enemies, ordered that Cicero be killed and that his head be placed between the two hands on the rostra."" Sure, I can use that any old time!"
4,I loved it!,"I love mysteries and stumbling on these were delightful! They could be on tv just as easily they are a quick read, perfect for a lunch break book fix."
4,Excellent production BUT . . .,"I ordered this as a birthday present for my daughter and she loves it, but in listening to the cd's, she noticed that the 8th cd contains the same story as the 10th cd even though it has a different title. Of course, by the time she discovered this, the window of opportunity for returning the set for a replacement had passed. Amazon's customer service says to contact the manufacturer for defective items, but the manufacturer says to get your replacement from Amazon since that was where the item was purchased initially. So, buy the set, just make sure you listen to it in good time to get a replacement in case it's faulty!!!!!"
2,It's Chesterton - but it hasn't fared well,"I'd been wanting to read more G K Chesterton (interesting man) and was pleased to find the 'Father Brown's going for a smile with the Kindle. Great stuff. But ...I can't fault the Kindle version, but Chesterton hasn't lasted well. The writing is good, but it belongs in a world where crooks are gentleman (""Raffles"", perhaps) and the class system is alive and well. One story relies on something happening in a house where no-one has visited. Amazing. Well, (spoilers...) no-one apart from tradesman, of course.So, read it as a timepiece maybe. These aren't good detective stories, just curiosities. Head for Dornford Yates instead - far more fun."
1,"Clean is nice, and different these days, but....","G.K. Chesterton is revered but it's for the writing quality not the story. This one is ridiculous, a thinly veiled attempt to make atheists look bad by staging a whodunnit murder involving a decapitation. He was a great writer, but thankfully plots this ridiculous aren't common these days."
4,VERY CUTE!,"I AM A BIG FAN OF PPG!IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD,CLEAN FIGHING GAME,THEN THIS IS IT.THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE.FIRST OF ALL,I THINK THE PLOT OF THE GAME WAS KIND OF DUMB.THE FIGHTING MOVES SHOULD BE A LITTLE FASTER.THE THING I WANNA KNOW IS WHERE IS ALL OF THE OTHER CHARACTERS?THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK IN THE CHARACTERS.PPG RULZ!"
2,bleh.,"as much as i love the powerpuff girls, this was kinda a disappointment. it HURT my hands to play this game since the characters moved so slowly! i did enjoy the narrative commentary and the CGi movies, though. there isn't any real replay value i could find, and for the sensitives that obviously never seen the show this is a FIGHTING GAME that has VIoLENcE. in short, want a powerpuff game? try the computer one ""mojo jojo's pet project"" or the one for the GBA ""mojo jojo a go-go"". stay away from this one unless you're hardcore (like me. ^^;) nut."
2,Little disapointing,Its a really hard game to play unless you put the cheat codes in. I love the power puff girls but this game was a little disappointing. But at least it was better then the other powerpuff girls game Relish rampage. That game was so terrible i wouldn't recommend buying that one.
2,The right idea but not exactly a success.,This was one of the first games I received; Up until then I owned no games myself. Don't let the nice looking CGI intro and PPG theme fool you though. It's not a good game.It's a rather slow game. It's hard to execute moves. It's hard to win a battle and even after you do it isn't full-filling. I would only recommend this game to the most die hard PPG fan.Rent it first.
2,SD card obsolete,"1 g sd cards are virtually impossible to find and they will only get harder to find. I'm sure this is a nice unit, but I'm sending my back and waiting for a new model of this recorder that will be of use in the future. If you do find SD cards that can be used with this unit, it will probably be on line and you'll pay more for shipping than the card is worth. Come on, Boss/Rolland get with it. It's the 21 century."
2,broken purchase,"The product I purchased was broken when I recieved it. I had to send it to the manufacture for repair. In the future, if I purchase anything from Amazon again, I will need to be careful who I purchasing an item from. Thanks Victor Bernal"
1,SlideShow Expressions is not very Expressive.,"I was disappointed that while one can do pan and zoom on images, one CANNOT create MPEGs or WMVs. One can only write to a CD... This makes combining this tool with others that handle video a real pain. Also, the GUI is very restrictive. Not a great product. So, while I only spent $20 for it, it did not meet my needs, and I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Great for Beginners or Professionals!,"I originally bought the Book out of curiosity, liked it so much, my daughter has decided to Window Paint for part time income. The Book gives simple, easy to follow directions, and great advice on how to get started in the Business. I love the full color Illustrations which demonstrate just how the Designs will look. Can't wait for the upcoming Video. Donna Grier"
1,It Does it's job,"It's an expansion pack that i needed for donkeykong 64,i hate the red grill but other than that it does it's job"
3,EXPANSION HITS 64,"THE N64 MEMORY EXPANSION PAK PROVIDES FUN ENTERTAINMENT FOR NEWER UP-TO-DATE GAMES.UNLESS YOU NEED ONE, THERES NOT MYCH POINT BUYING ONE!"
3,Good Investment- with ample funding!,"This is a good thing to have since some of the newer games like Rogue Squadron support it's accelerated graphics- better 3d graphics, smoother motion. Not a MUST HAVE. Also has good bragging value amomg you friends-makes your 64 faster."
3,the price is too high!,"I was having fun with my nintendo 64, but now there are games that recomend you to use the expansion pack(you need an expansion pack to save replays in tony hawk-unless you have ALOT of space free on your memory card, you need it to play on more then 2 players in hydro thunder.) Plus, the price is way too high.(It's not my fault people are starting to make more powerful games then the nintendo 64-or it's cartridges can handle.) Thank goodness the only game that actually requires it is donkey kong 64(which is just like banjo kazooie any way-except with different characters.A lot of the games that recomend an expansion pack are out for dreamcast (hydro thunder, tony hawk) that don't require an expansion pack. so if you don't have a dreamcast, you may want to buy this. But if you have a dreamcast, don't bother."
5,Does what it's supposed to do!,"My dad bought Donkey Kong at a Flee Market to play on his Nintendo 64, not knowing he would need an Expansion Pak in order to play it. I found this one for him, plugged it in and so far it works!"
4,"Good, but you might as well by DK64","This expansion pak is becoming more and more of a necessity among new games. While it does improve the graphics of most games somewhat, you should but it it purely because most new games and eventually all (according to Nintendo) will require it. If money is a problem, you might as well get a great game, Donkey Kong 64, that comes with the pak. Happy gaming."
3,"Essential, weather you like it or not.","First of all, this comes with Donkey Kong, so if you're thinking of buying that game, make sure you do, if you don't have an expansion pack.This little thing gives a boost to graphics, and it improves gameplay, but Nintendo should not make people pay this much just to keep playing games. It is essential for new games like Perfect Dark.You may be forced into this, but if you have an N64, you're gonna need this."
3,Only use it if you must.,This thing is only worth the money in games like Donkey Kong 64 and Perfect Dark where it is required to play. All it does is enhance graphics and add memory which isn't worth the ... price tag in my opinion
1,"Can we see a difference, please?","I don't know if my Nintendo 64 console is malfunctioning or the Expansion Pak isn't working properly OR if there's just not a whole lot of improvement with the Expansion Pak at all. I bought the Pak to enhance the graphics on my ""Star Wars: Episode I Racer"" game, however, I see no noticable difference in resolution or graphics modes. I would suggest that you hold-off on this costly purchase until you really need it for the the games that really count, such as ""The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask"" or ""Perfect Dark."" I suppose my Pak does work, because my ""Majora's Mask"" runs, but I really don't see why Nintendo forces you to buy this item at such a high price."
2,LONG PROCESS,havent recieved my package yet... the order said it was going to be here in 3-5 days.... its been more than 10 days now... and its the 16th or september and i checked the tracking package and it said it MIGHT be here the 20th.... getting realli irritated and frustrated!
2,Confusing!,"This book is vastly confusing and does not make learning Spanish easy. Parts of it are in Spanish and parts are in English. Only some of the new vocabulary is explained, and it's often difficult to understand the point or question they are trying to make/ask. The glossary and index in the back are virtually useless. I would recommend using other avenues to learn this language, unless you are in a class in which the profesor goes through the book with you and explains it."
3,Great beginner banjo,"This banjo will never play the Opry, but it is a great affordable instrument to get started with. With some setup, these banjos sound good, are easy to play, and are great for the beginner who does not wish to spend a fortune while deciding if the banjo is the right instrument for him or her."
4,Interesting,"I purchased this book when I was in my early teens, because I had never been to the USA and wanted to know more than the touristy things, very good photography with interesting stories to match."
3,Genesis for Scholars?,"Most of the Zondervon NIV Application Commentaries are excellent, seemingly written for the layman who wants deeper insight into the scriptures. I have purchased 7 of these commentaries and found them very helpful. The Genesis commentary by John Walton is indeed a scholarly book, too much so, and seems like he was writing for other scholars and at times, quite pretentious. I found it tedious and difficult to read and understand in places without intense study. I really wanted to study Genesis and not study Walton."
5,Finally...the manual I've been looking for!,My wife and I always joked about losing the 'manual' on childraising. We have been so pleased with this book! It covers every age (we have a 12 and 6 year old) and it's helped us out of many tight spots. We actually learned a thing or two ourselves.
5,You aren't ready till you own this book,"Disney World is HUGE and complicated. If you go unprepared you will miss half of the fun and spend most of your time confused and miserable. If you want to have a relaxing and fun vacation this is a must have. The detailed maps alone are reason enough to buy this book. And thats just the beginning. There isnt a detail left out. If youre going to Disney World, you need this book."
4,Almost too much information!,"The Passporter 2000 for Disney World is a wonderful resource. I bought a copy for my second ever trip to WDW in November of 2000 and found it very useful for organizing and planning all the details of the trip.It has detailed maps not only of the theme parks, but of the WDW resorts, which really helps when trying to choose where you want to stay and plan your itinerary. And the pockets in the back help you keep all those bits and pieces in one place while you are planning.The only drawback is that it is a bit cumbersome to carry around the parks with you. Once I had pinned down exactly what information I need from the Passporter, I found it easier to simply copy it, remember it, or remove and carry the pages with me."
5,A VITAL NEW CONTRIBUTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY,"WITH ITS RE-WRITING OF THE ORIGINS OF ENVIRONMENTALISM, THIS BOOK IS PROBABLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BOOK PUBLISHED IN ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY IN THE LAST 10 YEARS. I FELT IT COMPARED WELL WITH SIMON SCHAMA'S LANDSCAPE AND MEMORY IN HELPING US TO UNDERSTAND THE EVOLUTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN. IN PARTICULAR THE NOTION THAT ENVIRONMENTALISM BEGAN ON FRENCH OCEANIC ISLAND COLONIES, ESPECIALLY ON MAURITIUS, IS A REVOLUTIONARY ONE."
1,un realistic,this game is terrible. EA should take a look at shaun palmers pro snowboarder. the game uses people like Mac. Where are the real snowbpoarders? A misty flip isnt a 540 front flip!!!!!! and a rodeo is not a 540 backflip!!!! and you can do a backflip easier than a front flip. For a company like EA they should do a little research. I expected much better from EA
3,Do not get this game,"This game isn't very good. I read the previous reviews and they stated that even if you don't like snowboarding (like me), you would like this game. That is unfortunately not true. The game play got boring for me extremely quickly. If you don't like snowboarding, SSX Tricky is not worth your money."
5,This Has Everything That You Need For An Awesome Game!!,"SSX Tricky is a great game in many ways. One of the ways that makes it so great is its graphics. The graphics are so good that you barely can tell whether this is simulation or not!! Another great thing about this game is its dialogue. Each character has their very own personality. Examples: Mac acts like he is Eminem and Eddie is a disco dancer!! This game also has amazing tricks!! You can do front flips and backflips. You can also do some huge and sweet moves when your ""tricky"" meter fills up. I personally like to do the Single Events. You can choose from a race, a showoff, or a time challenge. A showoff is when you try to do lots and lots of tricks and get as many points as you can. Overall, this is a fabulous game!!!!!"
5,Screw Snake,"Ive never played the original SSX, I got Tricky as a gift from my brother who was a big fan of the original. It took me only a couple of runs to get a handle on the trick system, and from there, I was hooked. The tricks definetly sucked me in, but the later courses kept me coming back for more.The Tokyo Megaplex, an insane roller coaster of tubes and wires offers one of the funest experiences Ive ever had in a video game. All the courses are flawless, and a balst to play too.Not to mention the beautiful, colorful graphics that really do polish the game nicely. Did I mention the tricks? Doesnt get any better than seeing your character pull and uber trick soaring down a cliff, and hearing a sample of Run DMCs Tricky blast the speakers.It is a great game, however I can't compare it with the original, so those of you with the SSX, rent it. However I urge everyone else to buy this, you really wont regret it."
3,it's a pretty cool game,i think its pritty dum how u trip over nuthin id recomend the ssx tricky if u arent worried abot repitition the dialog is boring and annoying
1,Unrealistic,"This game is unrealistic. I think that pulling huge flips and spins that are 100% impossible in real life 1000 times in a row gets boring and repetitve after a while. Don't by this game, go get ESPN Winter X-Games Snowboarding 2002 instead of this piece of junk."
1,Awful excuse for a textbook,"This book is required reading at Austin Community College. It is clumsily organized and isn't worth 95 cents, let alone $95. It is supposed to be the textbook for the introductory writing class, but it assumes that the reader is quite familiar with English rhetorical techniques. The examples are often arcane and the author doesn't explain how the readings fit with the classifications.I understand that you might HAVE to purchase this book for a class, but buyer beware."
1,Wished I had saved my money!!!,"I purchased this book based on the reviews posted. However, it didn't live up to my expectations. What little advice he actually gives is basic common sense. He says this is what every woman needs to know about catching a man. Well, if you're in need of this very basic instruction, finding a man should not be your first priority. Also, he has padded the book heavily with quotes. I guess this is an attempt to compensate for the lack of original material. If you eliminated all of the quotes and references to other works, you'd be left with little more than a pamplet. If you are a single woman, and you are serious about finding a nice guy remember patience is a virtue. Don't waste your money on this one, unless you're in the market for a book of relationship quotes. This book gets one star only because of the clever fishing metaphor used."
2,the Title says it all!,"After reading this book, I feel the only thing I got out of it is that ""Men are like Fish"". It really is a perfect analogy, if you go chase or try to catch fish, they all run away, but if you stay still and bait them, they will swim towards you. I get this concept, but I was hoping to get more specific details as to how exactly to ""bait"" men or ""hook"" men. Yes it mentioned about ""love yourself"", ""take care of yourself, physically and mentally"", ""learn to spot the right fish"", ""if you can't hook him, then it's not the right fish for you"" etc. I already know about these basic principals, but again, I didn't see any specifics on exactly what a woman needs to do, or be aware of, in order to hook a man and land in marriage.I think this book is too generic, and the title basically wraps it up."
3,Was OK,"I am a little dissapointd about this book.. I thought it was going to be great.. but to tell you the truth, I ended up more confused than at the begining. Is a book that is okay if you dont have anything else to read.. but I didnt get too much out of it.. I like books that give me information that I dont have or entertain me.. and this book didnt achieve any of them. The comparison that he makes between how fishing is like catching a man it gets sometimes surreal and almost unbelievable."
4,Fishing is Like Buying a Dress,"When you buy a dress some things are important to you:1. Quality (what it's made of)2. Fit (no too tight or too loose)3. Makes you feel terrific (otherwise why bother?)4. Isn't too high a price to pay (get out of it what you invest)5. You can go anywhere with it (it travels well)Reading Men Are Like Fish brings home in a very kind way the undeniable fact that until a woman is self-developed with her own life (friends, health, hobbies, satisfying career) and self-esteem is firmly anchored, she will not attract a good man. Fishing is a patience sport and so it is with finding a quality man. There are pearls of wisdom throughout this book. Yes, it is work to attract, find and keep a good man, but so is settling for less-than-satisfying situations. If you want good, practical, friendly advice on necessary elements, read this book."
2,Overwrought,"Linsha Majere lacks charisma. There are a lot of details poured into her character, and she definitely comes across as a courageous, if unconventional, knight; but somehow I get the feeling that Mary Herbert is still trying to convince herself as to who Linsha Majere is. The writing seems a little overwrought, and the fantasy in the book (e.g. a modern city built around a spirit city) really doesn't serve the story. I'm still trying to finish this one, and I'm not sure I'll continue with the trilogy."
2,"good concept, unfortunately not well done","After reading the other reviews and leafing through the online book pages, I thought this would be a great book to review as a medical student prior to the Shelf. However, going through just the second chapter resulted in numerous errors. The most glaring being the most likely cause of hypercalcemia, which was alleged to be familial hypercalcuria hypercalcemia (in reality it is parathyroid adenoma in the general population, malignancy in the hospital). This is a very basic question, which made me question the rest of the book. Leafing through other parts of the book, I found more errors, and have decided to return the book.Although the concept of the book is great, the author should have invested some time in fact-checking."
4,Vev Vigano Kontessa Stovetop Espresso Maker,"The Vev Vigano Kontessa is a stainless steel stovetop espresso maker. Our previous aluminum bialleti style pot was no longer working correctly and we decided to get stainless steel. This model has a good reputation online. We bought the 6-demitasse size. The first one we recieved had a loose hinge pin that had fallen out during shipping. When I reported this to the seller, Kasbahouse, then immediately responded saying they would ship another top. As it turned out they sent another entire unit. So kudos to Kasbahouse for excellent customer service. The Kontessa is solidly made and works well. Two minor downsides: the hinge design could be better and the threaded connection between the top and bottom is a little difficult for my wife to get tight.Stovetop Espresso Maker - Vev Vigano Kontessa Gold 6 cup size"
2,"Liked it, but it rusted","I started off really liking my Vev Vigano 6 cup. It's solid and sturdy and makes a good cup of coffee. But I started disliking how hot the handle got, and how I had to use an oven mitt or a towel all the time to lift it off the burner. And when it started to rust.....well, that's what sealed the deal. I'm getting a new coffee pot, and not this kind. It rusts on the inside because of the way the bottom is designed, with that flared base. Water never drains fully, even when I turn the detached base upside down. It started ruining the taste of my coffee, and I'm worried about the metal I'm ingesting with every cup. Buyer, beware."
2,Accurate Title,"I am a fan of the Uncle John reader series. This book is an ""Uncle John's Presents"" title. The writing style is similar to the ""1000 ways to die"" television show,which I find to be crap. I left the book in the break-room at work in case someone else could tolerate it."
2,Stupid is as Stupid Does,"I was hugely disappointed with this Uncle John's offering and will most likely not purchase an ""Uncle John Presents"" book again.While some of the happenstances were definitely noteworthy Dumb, most were just interpretations of the author's view of ""dumb"". I want fact, not commentary. I want to form my own opinion of whether something is dumb or not. I do not want to have some other guy's opinion of what is dumb shoved down my throat.Although delegated to the bathroom of my house, as are all of the Uncle John's books, no one read past the first few entries."
1,NOT GREAT BY ANY MEANS,This is not a terrible release but its not that great either. Their are some decent riffs and Andy is on drums which rules but this release falls short compared to other bands . There just nothing new to offer on this release like there was with other Death Metal CD's at the time.
2,Interesting premise but doesn't deliver in the end.,"While I always felt I enjoyed good ""conspiracy"" novels, I found Hawley's work a bit of a disappointment. I commend the author's style and and attention to his characters but I found the story and plot teasingly tired and leaving the reader completely disappointed in the rather bizarre ending. Maybe I missed something along this peculiar ride but this is a book I cannot recommend."
3,"vivid, pulsating","In this tense, tumid thriller, Noah holly's sensational plot jerks the reader up and down. Veteran conspiracy readers will be delighted at the altogether different sensation of Holly's grasping, tugging prose. One minute, Holly is rubbing the reader's head with a cornucopia of conspiracy facts. Then,a sudden twist in the plot leaves the reader with a shower or nectar all over. The altogether new and original writing of ""Conspiracy"" simply leaves no room for clean up."
4,Robert Ludlum meets Gabriel Marquez,"""Conspiracy of Tall Men"" is a government coverup. Right! What a marvelous way to mirror this country. Besides the fun of covering every conspiracy theory I have ever read about, this novel has solid characterization and beautiful imagery. I became lost in the conspiracies. They became the norm and I followed the story as if I were reading a Robert Louis Stevenson tale. Thought provoking, great fun and very well written. And that's enough for me!"
2,Meh,These are not very good. The taste is similar to slimjims but they're not as tasty. The texture is a little off too. A little mealy. If the taste was better or the texture was more appetizing they would have gotten a better review from me.
2,Somewhat greasy and mild tasting,"The taste was somewhat greasy. Hoped for a product better than ""Slim Jims"" but they are not. They responded to my criticisms and are sending me a sample of another product they feel I might like better."
4,Better then a Slim Jim,"These are way better then Slim Jims. Less greasy and more flavor. The Mild Short Shot's are just a really good product, nice smokey flavor, no pockets of grease like a slim jim and very consistent. Fast shipping as always."
1,NASTY!,"I have never eaten a beef stick as bad as this. the reason you don't see this brand at your local store is there would never be a repeat customer. only amazon suckers will by this crap.Its really hard to describe what something taste like but I will try.VERY VERY dry. the last mouthful I spit out tasted like blood. powdered blood.I don't see how anyone who has ever eating a beef stick you can buy at the local corner store even think of giving this shit 2 or more stores. what a bunch of BS reviewers.You ever eat something so good, you cant stop eating it like potato chips? this junk will not have that problem LOLUck!"
1,Expired,"I received this package this morning and as soon as I opened the box I knew something was wrong. The beef sticks were dry and hard, so I looked a little closer at the package and found that the sell by date is over a month ago. Not happy."
4,"Actually, 3 and 1/2 stars-- very promising","I recently caught these guys at a club, and picked up their CD. Not bad at all. My initial reaction was that they sounded like Ry Cooder, particularly from his collaboration with V.M. Bhatt on ""A Meeting by the River,"" with a bit of jazz thrown in. The arrangements are pretty straight forward-- slide guitar, bass, drums and percussion. Stylistically, the musicians draw from blues, jazz and world music fluently. My complaint is that too often, rather than blend styles, they play one style at a time (switching between blues, jazz and world music styles), and when they blend styles most effectively, it is a blend of Indian and blues, which sounds amazingly like Cooder and Bhatt's collaboration mentioned earlier (hence, they lose a few points on originality). This CD is worth owning, but I look forward to better things in the future from Crowsong."
2,Poor print quality,"Having just seen the exhibit today (June 6 2005), and having perused copies of the book available at the exhibit, I concur that the color reproduction negates the highly informative text of this book."
5,"Good retrospective, and good image quality.","This book is the most comprehensive collection of Max Ernst work. Having read the other reviews, I was concerned the print quality would be less than stellar. I find the print quality and color reproduction to be fine. No art book ever captures the full impact of the actual art, and color correction is one of the more problematic aspects of printing. MOMA and the Yale University did a good job with this book. This is a good collection of work and I wouldn't hesitate buying it again."
5,Worth buying,This product is perfect for removing ingrown toenails. I wish I would have purchased it years ago.
2,Too pointed,This nipper is very well made but the tips are just too pointed.You're more likely to cause damage than to trim that ingrown toenail.The tips should be at least slightly rounded to prevent them poking into sensitive tissue.They might be better if someone else was using them on you but I'm ado-it-myselfer.

4,Almost Everything,"Vanessa Williams is a true definitive diva that still shows that she can showcase any note she performs. Yet, it has been almost a decade since her last record, Next, was released. The big question is that can she comeback to the mainstream. Her latest single, You Are Everything, the first single from her album Everlasting Love is a very well put soulful ballad. Yet, while there are just so many manufactured acts that try to sound hip with imagery like Beyonce', Britney Spears and Ashanti, Vanessa still has a great feeling for the true sense of delightful music. This song is just pure classic.Song: B"
1,No Stars!! Huge Mistake... Don't Buy!!!!!!,"Understanding that this is an inexpensive camera, in all honesty I had a $25.00 camera that was so much better. The quality of the photo's is ok considering the minor purchase price, but I put brand new batteries in it yesterday (the camera was just purchased), took 5 photos which were saved to a memory card, and turned the camera off. I was able to take only two more photo's today before the batteries died!!! I can't say i've ever seen anything consume batteries like this in my entire life. Yes, I bought a memory card that can hold 50 photos of high quality, but it would take me about 10 packs of batteries to take them! Save the money you'll spend on batteries for a few weeks and buy something decent."
4,Great and Cheap Camera!!!,This camera is of good quality for its price. Really good for teenagers who want a great camera without spending so much money.:)
3,A Lot of Information in a Small Package - Good Topic Survey,"As I purchased this book b/c I didn't know much about Islam, and wanted a starting point, I found it be very useful to me. I cannot evaluate the accuracy of all the information, as some other reviewers have done. I felt it was a great survey of many subtopics.Perhaps what disturbed some readers was that the book does not touch only on the ""religious"" aspects of Islam. However, based on another book I had read, Islam the religion is irreversibly entangled with Islamic politics and society. Indeed, the author of Islam: AVSI states as much with the first three headings in Chapter 1: Islam as Identity, Islam as Political Ideology, and Islam as Faith. This is similar to Jews, who usually identify as Jewish regardless of whether they practice the faith.I was very pleased with my purchase of this VSI, and highly recommend it. I now go on to further my learning with a trip through a translation of the Quran."
4,"Great looking, easy to install, easy to use.","This is the third soft tonneau I've owned in 12 years. I like that this one lays flat, my last two bowed upward in the middle. I love the roll-up and latching system, makes it much easier to switch between covered and open bed. Just pop the latches, roll-up, and buckle. I don't know yet how water-tight the system is, previous tonneaus mounted on top of the bed sides, this one mounts inside the bed sides. The look is cleaner that the top-of-the-bed mounts, but might let water leak down. Would have given 5 stars, but the weather stripping on one rail was trashed at the end (packaging was completely intact, so this was done before packaging and shipping)."
3,Get the Hallelujah Video...don't waste your money on this one,"I'll give it to Ricky, He did an excellent job with the audio aspects of the album/DVD. As usual, the perfect songs for the perfect choir. The video, on the other hand....bites! This is horrible compared to the videos Hallelujah (Malaco did a much better job even for a low budget release) and Worked It Out (released by Crystal Rose). Is it me or are all the record labels trying to tell us something? Like they don't care how the artist look or sound, just as long as we get the dough... If you really want to catch some good ole' Ricky & New G, get Hallelujah. You may pay a little more, but for nearly 2 hours of non stop real UNPLUGGED Chu'ch...it worth it!"
1,Definantly not unplugged and so not what the church used to be,"I got this DVD on Saturday, 24 June 2006 and was so excited to watch this one.I thought I was buying an unplugged Gospel celebration. But, I was wrong.This is definantly not unplugged and the singing is mediocre at best. The production quality is bad and it looks as if everyone stepped back into the early 80's (guess that's where the 'The way the church used to be' tagline comes in.I definantly wanted to unplug this DVD ASAP and will be trying to sell this to anyone willing to not get what they pay for.Pass this one up."
4,Engrossing page-turner,"Minette Walter's can always be counted on for delivering a satisfying psychological thriller and FOX EVIL is no exception. All of Walter's novels are a pleasure to read because they are so well-crafted. There is a wonderful array of characters in FOX EVIL, all fleshed-out and wonderfully alive on the page. Only the ending is a bit of a let-down. I don't want to give anything away because trying to figure things out is half the fun, but the ending seemed a bit safe for a Walter's novel.All and all, a page-turner of a book that keeps you guessing. With a better resolution to the plot, this would have been a five star book for me."
3,Entertaining but Falls Short,"Minette Walters wrote a book that I thought I would love, but I ended up just liking it. This novel is well-written and the author did a fine job with plot, dialogue, inner monologues--the whole bit. In trying to figure out where this one fell short for me, I think maybe it is just a matter of taste. The villians were a bit to venal, the heroes a bit too good, and I was just irritated by the chapters told from a child's point of view.That said, all-in-all I would not consider the time spent reading this book wasted by any means."
2,Fox Evil,"Sorry to disagree with the enthusiastic publishers and some readers, but I found Fox Evil an utter bore, with little action, long-winded conversation that doesn't move the story forward, and characters for whom I felt little interest. Walters also knows little about police investigative techniques, judging by the interviews that various officers conduct. Sadly, I've been unable to complete Walters last two books, also boring and with unsympathetic characters. She has been a disappointment for me, for I really enjoyed her earlier works, The Ice House, The Scupltress, and the Scold's Bridle. I also find her injection of news items, letters, police reports, etc., as shortcuts to explalining certain plot action. Either describe it succinctly as possible or let the characters do it. I'm not holding my breath for Walters nexr opus."
2,The second album from the before Guess Who band!,"Before the next 1966 album ""It's Time"". The Guess Who were called before as Chad Allan & The Expressions without second lead vocals Burton Cummings is another chronicling detail story of their background music in history. Compared to as the fab four from britain called ""The Beatles"". And a lookalike reputation right here of this old album CD disc title and the song included called ""Hey Ho (What You Do To Me)"".I would'nt say this is the best music ever but when Burton Cummings voice is connected to my feelings of opinions then I'll know it's good for myself!"
4,Walking with Your Ancestors: A Genealogists Guide to Using Maps and Geography,A Great Reference book on How too especially for those who are not familiar with the Historical Geography of where their ancestors lived. Probably not a necessity for those who are familiar with Historical Geography or the area where their Ancestors Lived.
1,TERRIBLE! NOT THE QUALITY FROM THE PAST!,"Starting w / the container: It used to be ""TIN"" which kept the candy fresher. This new container gave the candy the taste of ""PLASTIC"" which was not pleasing at all!!! The quality of the taste there again did not compare to what it used to be; too sweet, not the deep rich flavor filling or the quality taste of good chocolate. Very disappointed and will not be purchasing again! I will order Harry London before I order this!"
5,Two rooms of porcelain tile with ease!,"I was nervous about this saw honestly because the price is pretty low in comparison to the professional grade saws. We just put down the 18x18 inch hard porcelain tile in two large rooms and this saw handled it very well! I was frankly amazed at how well the saw did. This is the second tile job that I have ever done and with the first borrowed a saw from a contractor friend that was over $1,000. It had the running water and cut well but to my amazement this saw cut as well as the really expensive saw. The one downside was that you cant use the guards with big tile. There was also one spot near the wall where I needed 2 inch slivers of tile and this handled it well. If you didnt rush it and are careful it cuts great! One note its very messy. Goggles and waterproof clothes might of been good. It did get pretty cold by the end of the day since the saw flings water and it was pretty cold out."
4,Worked well for kitchen backsplash,"This tool worked well. I used 3x6 tiles and had to flip the tile to finish a 6in cut because the blade guard got in the way.As other noted, the water pan is a bit of a pain to fill.Overall i was very please with it. Worked well for a small job"
4,was what was represented,the product arrived in a timely manner and was as represented. i hate ordering something that isn't what you thought it was or a product that has to be modified in order to be used.
3,Don't Stop Here,"This is a fine introduction to some of the more famous themes in classical music, but don't stop here. This gives only one movement of each piece, robbing you of an opportunity to learn to love classical music.If you're new to classical music, buy this album, then look at your local symphony's calendar and wait until they're playing one of these pieces. Go see it in concert, and you'll begin to appreciate why it is so beloved."
3,Not as great as claimed.,This book got far better reviews than it deserves. It mostly is an advertisement for the Author.
3,Not as helpful as I had hoped,Books like this should have ample suggestions and take-aways that anyone can implement and see results. I could not connect with this text.
1,Highway of heartache,"I was Easter Ruth in the movie, please don't watch it as the guy didn't pay anyone! and shouldn't get a penny as we did not!I looked good though. Christ RUSSELL"
5,Ursula Does It Again,"With the Earthsea saga, Ursula Le Guin created a world of youths gifted with the ability to use their minds and words. Here, in Gifts, another world is created once again by Ursula Le Guin where the youths have tremendous talents. Masterfully told by a skilled science fiction crafter, Gifts is finally out after a long period of absence from the author. It is worth the wait."
3,Dreamcatcher,"If you are working on a project and need a little help of upbeat music, then this is the CD to have. The CD arrived on time and like new."
2,not the same color of topaz as in the picture,they are a bit small for an adult so i gave them to my daughter. the blue topaz is also not the same shade as in the picture - a bit darker and smaller.
3,Murder She Baked,"This series about cookie baker amatur detective Hannah Swensen reminds me of the TV series ""Murder She Wrote."" The characters are lightweight and the mysteries are simple - often too simple. The ""romance"" between Hannah and her two beaus, Mike and Norman, is nearly nonexistent - so much so that one has to wonder why the author includes it at all. Still, despite flaws, this series is likable and the recipes sound good. The audio version is read by Suzanne Toren, who makes the characters sound as sugary sweet as they are written."
3,"Average story, great recipes","A nice little cozy mystery (number 4 in the series). Nothing amazing or wonderful, just... a nice read. The characters are good, the story line moves along nicely, and the author really gives you a lot of clues to solve it yourself.It gets high marks for having, hands-down, my favorite cookie recipe to date (Mystery Cookies). Try them, they are amazing!"
5,Good bread,"I found the Toastmaster bread maker to be of significant quality. We had a previous Toastmster machine that served us well, for over ten years. I epecially value the dough stting as it us the fredom to bake any size of bread we choose to bake. I highly approve of the machine"
4,Use it almost daily,"This is one appliance that does not just take up space on the countertop. It has battery backup and will start up where it left off when unplugged. I make a fresh loaf of whole wheat bread in it daily, and have made cranberry nut and lemon poppyseed bread, with perfect results. These quick breads bake more evenly in the bread machine than in the conventional oven. I've also made pizza dough with better results than by hand, I think due to the fact that the baking environment inside the machine is always just right. This is a great machine, easy to use and makes breadmaking simple. I think the crust comes out too dark even when set for a light crust, so I stop the bake cycle early. I highly recommend this breadmaker."
5,Phenomenal,"This outstanding work could have been titled ""How to share the gospel by way of the Old Testament,"" or ""All the prophecies predicting Christ's first incarnate appearance."" It is an oversized book which makes it a bit awkward for holding up in one hand while reading and for underlining (which I like to do), but it was well worth it. Also, I loved the author's writing style. It was easy to read and easy to understand. I will likely purchase other books by Fruchtenbaum in the future. The author details many items of interest from a Messianic Jewish perspective. He compares what Christian theologians say to what the ancient Rabbi's wrote and proves his points over and over again by use of Scripture. If you are interested in prophecy or in witnessing to a non-believing Jew or in learning some REALLY interesting facts about the Old Testament (and a few in the NT) then this book is a MUST. I highly recommend it."
1,"Don't Buy It, It's A Rip Off",I am writing this review to save others from wasting twenty bucks! This ebook is a piece of garbage. It is filled with typos. How can a book on the mind be so scatter brained? It vomits up a bunch of obvious general observations that a five year old could make. It wastes page space on an entire song by the very wise genius- Christine Augulera? Are you f ing kidding me? I got burned on this garbage and am trying to save others. There are plenty of REAL books on the law of attraction out there. This one is just someone scribbling random ideas on paper and calling it a book. It does not have even half the information it promises to deliver. I really can't see how amazon permitted this to enter their product list. I am shocked that they feel justified to charge people twenty dollars for this piece of junk. Now I know why I see it at ebay for .98 cents. That's all it's really worth. What a joke.
3,a good read,"This book by Marks i certainly different from most. The book is about a love affair but much more than that. It covers a family and their interactions as well as aterrorist extra. The conclusion is not expected. This is a novel that I enjoyed reading.J. Robert Ewbank author ""Wesley's Wars"" and ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the isms"""
4,Wonderful Read,"My wife bought the book, as I am recovering from surgery. I started reading ""September"" and simply could not put it down. What a love story! Just may be the best book I've read all year!"
3,Ok,"This is fairly good collection of the songs but they are still missing a few song and some of them aren't done by the original artists. Plus they are missing ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" by Nirvana which I believe nobody mentioned."
2,Joel Harper's Fit Pack.,"I was disappointed in this DVD. I'm 72 years old and these exercises are too difficult. I bought this because I have ""Joel Harper's Firming After 50"" which is more recent than ""Fit Pack"", and I wanted to see his other work. ""Firming After 50"" is infinitely a better production and serviceable for me."
1,Too slow for me (and I'm over 50),"I have at least 20 fitness videos, but wanted to get a couple on DVDs -- and I'm still looking, because this purchase was an expensive mistake. No doubt if someone persisted in following these exercises, they'd get fit -- but I need leaders with enthusiasm, music with a beat, and participants who at least pretend to be having fun. First exercise: hold your hands out in front of you and waive your fingers and hands back an forth, for - no kidding - 120 seconds. For excitement, stand on one leg, then switch to the other leg every 30 seconds or so. Not my idea of motivation. I'm going back to Denise Austin or ""The Firm."""
5,Searing story of injustice,I have read this book many thrice now and it never fails to amaze me. I don't know how the British government can repay Conlon and his friends. 2 decades is no joke. They will never get the best years of their lives back again.
5,These ramps rock,I have a lifted Dodge 2500 and these things will get my Polaris 550XP into the bed with no problems. I wouldn't trust the straps that come with the ramps though. They are a little flimsy so I got some ratchet straps from WallyWorld for cheap and I use those. Very light and strong.
3,Basic in Interpretation,"When one need to study and learn the basics, this is the original guidebook on guiding! The text is almost quaint (written in the 50's) as are the pictures, but there are still nuggets worth mining.I found myself highlighting the ""do""s and ""don't""s that are now features in other fields such as marketing and customer service. There aren't many reference books on the subject of interpretation, so this is a good place to start."
3,"Andis 18380 ProMotor Power Fade Hair Clipper, 20 Piece Kit","The Andis 18380 ProMotor Power Fade Hair Clipper, 20 Piece Kit is a hair clipper kit that is under $30. quite honestly you do get what you pay for. these clippers are sold for a low price and give you low quality. the blades do not run smooth, the motor does not run really quiet. the blades pinch and pull hair as opposed to clipping and cutting it. the case gets hot when running the clippers for over 13-15 minutes, hot to the point you have to put them down and let them cool down. i wouldn't recommend these clippers to anyone."
4,watch out for Jamison - they groove!,Jamison Live is definitely worth buying and I recommend checking them out in person as well! They have phenomenal energy that is eminent in their sound and creative lyrics! I also urge you to check out some of their acoustic shows - typically in known coffee houses around Denver and Boulder. Watch for them!
3,Ending doesn't make sense,"Best parts: good writing, interesting characters, super great premise for the book.A little disappointing: at times a bit slow-paced; draggedVery frustrating ending: the verdict made little sense given the case presented by both sides; beyond that, we have no idea in the end what really happened. I'd rather be shocked with a final chapter with a twist than to be left with no real understanding of the truth."
3,A book to read--even if only for the last few pages.,"This book needs a sequel, and another, and another. It's interesting to me that there were so many who would not hold the sign, and even more interesting, what some of their excuses were. I found myself laughing at Margaret Thatcher's quote: ""Well, I won't touch it. But if you place it on the table, I'll stand beside it."" At least she was open to the idea of the Love sign. The Love Book is a symbol... A self named symbol for us to have and to look upon now and far into the future. It is a timeless book which only needs updates. Every culture, every era, every government should have a ""Love Book"" showing the diversity of the people. The Love Book is made of people, and helps us to realize that we must not take love, or people for granted. With out people, there would be no love...and with out love, there would be no people."
1,Waste of money- takes worthless pictures,My kids LOVE using the camera.We were thrilled at the comcept of a kids digital Camera.I would give THIS product a 0 or half star rating if I could.The pictures absolutly SUCK!!!!!And It is a horrible painful process to try and upload them on the computer!!!!!!We didnt even try the software as the pictures were so crappy!!!I hope to find a better digital camera for my kids. They keep wanting to use their camera.
1,Garbage,"This camera is garbage. It was a disappointment for my son and a waste of my money. It was hard to figure out, it took lousy pictures, it burned through batteries. Avoid this camera. I just wish I could give it zero stars."
1,Blurry pics at any resolution,"I've tried it all, and every pic comes out blurry. It seems that you have to be able to hold perfectly still for about 3 seconds after you push the button and wait for the 2nd beep. I don't know may 5 and 6 year olds that will hold still when taking a pic.Software is Average, but it doesn't help the blurry pics."
1,"hard to use, doesn't work with iphoto","Because this product has no display, it's hard for anyone, let alone a ""kid"" to use. Example: it has about 8 ""modes"" and only 2 digit 7-segment lcd indicator so it says things like ""Hd"", ""Cl"", ""Cd"", and ""Of"". what are these supposed to mean?Not supported by iPhoto, so if you were hoping not to use the included software, forget it."
3,It was OK,"i had just recently bought this camera, and it was OK. the quaility of the pictures was pretty ok. i couldnt really understand it, and what really stinks is that i lost the stupid CD that comes with it and now i cant install it. overall i would say that the camera is a stinky peice of JUNK. now im begging my parent to buy me a REALL DIGITAL CAMERA!!not a peice of crap."
1,Kids cam scam,"This camera is a piece of junk and the packaging is deceptive. The picture quality is barely visible and the software is not easy for children to use. The ""LCD"" screen does not display the pictures, only letters denoting the camera setting. It may be cheap, but it is still not worth the money."
1,Waste of $20,"What a bummer. My husband bought this for our daughter's Christmas present, and it's essentially useless. It takes regular batteries rather than being rechargeable like normal digital cameras, and the batteries die really quickly. There's no screen for her to see her pictures. It's hard to figure out how to use. Controls are not intuitive. She still wants to take pictures though, so we're probably going to have to go buy a different one. Any recommendations??"
1,Not a good way to start!,"I would rate this product at half a star or no star if that was an option.Even at $15, this is NOT a good product.1 - the packaging is misleading. I had no idea that this camera takes Black and White pictures. I had no idea there is NO LCD display.2 - no flash3 - black and white4 - poor viewfinder - what was centered to my eye appears to the upper right corner in the actual photo5 - crappy quality - extremely grainy even at the best resolutionI was most frustrated after shopping for a cheap and age-appropriate camera that almost everything is supported by one company, Sakar, and everything had incomplete and inaccurate packaging. It was almost impossible to determine whether or not it had ALL the features I wanted.The software included is okay and seems to work fine for my 6yo, IF he could ever take a decent picture that is more than of his friends eyes..."
3,Hard To Classify,"Since Signal To Noise is my first outing with the music of White Willow, I can't compare it to the group's previous efforts. But after many listens, I have come to appreciate the band to a certain degree. The problem, as one reviewer pointed out, is the problem of classification. The band was recommended to me as a prog band, but Signal To Noise is not a prog album. Yeah, you hear prog elements, but you also hear metal and darkly goth elements as well.To me, the best track is the powerful Dusk City, but I also find Night Surf, Ghosts, and The Lingering interesting.There is enough to like on Signal To Noise to spur me to seek out some earlier White Willow albums even though I am aware that there will be a different vocalist. But based on what I've heard here, I much prefer another Swedish group (Paatos) whose style is in a similar vein."
5,A Must Read for the TRUTH,"I just got the book today and I cannot put it down. It is written well, straightforward and contains some tidbits we have heard before and some new information... but now we know the tidbits that are TRUE and not a tabloid reporters made up fantasy as the Ramsey's have said. I sure hope Mr. Thomas will write a follow up book if and when there is a trial."
1,Author Steve Thomas must be incarcerated for slander and profiteering,Author Steve Thomas must be incarcerated for slander and profiteering out of a tragedy. At the least he must be ordered by court to return all the profits to a charity. Fools who believe cheap books like this should be ashamed of themselves.
4,Very Informative,"The information and Steve Thomas' theory of this crime makes this book very interesting. The story is slow and repetative at times but if half of it is true, it is a tragedy. I still believe the Ramseys did it and just because they are ""upper class"" doesn't mean they are not capable of murder. Unfortunately, a jury will never be able to decide if they are truly innocent."
2,STILL AN UNSOLVED CRIME,"Does Steve Thomas know something that everyone else doesn't? Thomas was a narcotics detective until he became involved with the Ramsey case. He developed ""tunnel vision"" early on, convinced that the Ramseys were guilty of the heinous crime. He has spent an enormous amount of his time attempting to prove his theory to be true, despite his lack of credentials as a seasoned homicide investigator. I have more faith in the testimony of Lou Smit, a respected homicide detective, who has given us compelling evidence that an intruder killed JonBenet. Certainly the Boulder police screwed up the case from the beginning, and are in denial and pointing fingers of blame everywhere but themselves. DA Alex Hunter did not distinguish himself through his own reckless conduct with tabloid reporters either. The tragedy is that this heinous murder will likely never be solved. Not by Steve Thomas anyway."
1,"Did you write your own reviews, Thomas?",I read all the reviews and noticed that those that gave you top marks read like they had been written by the same person.
2,"Interesting, but not spectacular","Out of the sixteen stories I liked four, and I will only comment on a handful of them:The Real Thing/ Alison Goodman -- wonderfully original, with concepts that one could imagine *could* come to pass.Quill/ Carol Emshwiller -- I found the writing choppy and annoying, and the story confusing. I may have enjoyed it more if it had been written in third person, instead of first.Perception/ Alan Dean Foster -- Convicting. Good entrance, great characters, fun concepts of the futuristic life.House on the Planet/ Tanith Lee -- interesting concepts, particuliarly how the reader got to follow the pass of time. Not wonderful, but not the worst.Unwrapping/ Nina Kiriki Hoffman -- I was surprised at how short this story was (10 pages). I was a bit confused at the end and had to backtrack to figure out what had happened. However, it was interesting and fun. (I liked this one decently enough).Overall I prefer the original Firebirds anthology over this one."
5,Really neat Idea,"Bought this with it's trailer. It came with the assembly parts kinda screwed up. It had an extra axle, extra cap nuts, but missing the trailer hitch and the hardware for it. I called Step Two, and talked to a woman there, explained what I needed, and was very satified with their help. I mentioned that it was a birthday present and I needed it by the weekend(it was Thursday) She said she'd try to get it to me as quickly as she could. I got it in Saturdays mail. I was extremely happy with the service I got. It was the best I've had from anywhere in a long time. The instructions should be read a few times before you try to assemble it. Not difficult, but some things should be thought out first. The wheels can be put on backwards, which I did, I put two on one way, two on the other way. Was glad it came with the extra cap nuts. I used two of em. Still had seven left over. I would buy one again, very tough outfit, the kids, and adults love it."
2,The Vac U pack bags,The machine works great on quart jars and gal jugs never has worked w/bags they leak wtih in a hour or a day. I had it for 5 years!
3,"Great dancing, but not very well lit !","Suhaila's dancing is very different, and always interesting. Some of it I like, some I don't, but never boring to watch.The one thing I did not like about this DVD was the lighting, during group numbers there was some partial lighting, and when the dancers were in the shadows you could barely see what they were doing! The solos were much better lit and I loved the little girl's solo. The dance setting was very professional and interesting, too bad I couldn't see all of the dancing because of the shadows."
1,misleading advertisement,"The ad showed 5 bears, and the second description says you get an ""assortment of new look characters."" The one bear we received,[No Choice] valued most places at around $30.00, cost us about $114.00 with shipping.13? huggable plushAssortment of new look charactersIncludes DVD of the new care bears series, music video and computer gamesHeart button on the backside of each bear further identifies each as a special Care BearChoose from a number of styles for great collectibility!See add at: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000P4T03Y/ref=asc_df_B000P4T03Y1398428?smid=AV9SZQUV7KDEK&tag;=dealtmp462142-20&linkCode;=asn&creative;=395105&creativeASIN;=B000P4T03Y"
3,Greek Phrase book,This is split up for types of conversations you need. Not easily looked up unless you study the book.
4,Plants are growing well.,"Plants are growing well. Sturdy low maintenance pots. Goes well with the Fiskars 20-51010C 10-Inch Terratray Planter Tray, Color Clay."
5,A great book by a great author,"Secret Vampire is just one awesome book in a great series. The Night World series is one of my favorites, and anyone considering reading it should read Secret Vampire first because it is the very first book in the series. I love how it's not just blood and horror, but all the books in Night World are true romance stories. I suggest reading these books slowly because the newest book, Strange Fate, still hasn't been released. I would also reccomend all of LJ Smith's other books. I have read all but one and own all but two and they are all terrific."
2,Just...No,"Thank God this wasn't the first L.J. Smith book I read. I didn't really like this book... I liked the very beginning and the very end; the middle was a struggle to get through. I thought all the characters were annoying and cookie-cut out from somewhere. I have the volume that includes the first three, so I'll be reading the next two at least, which I've heard are better than the first. I previously read The Secert Circle series by Smith, which was fantastic, but so far, the Night World series is not living up."
5,I found a writer,"As a foreigner interested in american litterature I test various authors relying on opportunities for discovery. With J.C Oates, and with this book in particular, this is a different story. This is a piece of litterary art, style, composition, connection to contemporary issues (male/female relationships, children parents, blacks / whites in the 50ies). If you want to further explore what being an author means, get hold of ""The Assignation"" from the same author. A collection of astounding text miniatures."
1,"This is ""NOT"" the wonderful documentary ""Semper Fi"" these reviews talk about!!!","I ordered this after seeing the film/documentary about Jeff Key (Semper Fi) on TV. THIS IS ""NOT"" that. It ""is"" an interview with questions asked by a girl/woman who is off camera, and the sound is awful- so you can NOT UNDERSTAND A WORD SHE SAYS."
3,pretty good,"The tool worked well on the terminals it actually can work on, can't blame the tool. This is a 5 star tool when it has the extractor you need and a waste of time when it doesn't. I'll be buying the other lisle terminal tool as soon as possible."
5,AWESOME PRODUCT!,I bought these tires to replace a set of glued on rubber tires that came as original equipment. WOW! What a difference. It made my tired old bandsaw come to life. Had I known I would have made this upgrade much earlier. Buy this product.One caution. Follow the directions carefully. Pre-soaking these tires in very warm water is essential to easy application. I stretched them on with bicycle tire wrenches. Worked great.
3,"NOT a narrative--this is a guidebook, or handbook","This is the last book published under Moitessier's name--he never finished it himself--of tips he had collected over the years. It's divided into three sections: (1) preparing a boat, (2) sailing, navigating, weather forecasting; and (3) how to become self sufficient once you reach your island paradise. It's a practical guide, NOT a story, but if you are interested in tips on how Moitessier learned to harvest coconuts, plant a garden on an Atoll, (he brought his own topsoil) or built many of his boats then this could be for you."
5,simply great,"an amazing guide to those who want to learn more about this lifestyle, Bernard brings a very intimate point of view of the ocean, very useful too"
2,DISSAPOINTING STUFF,"I was very dissapointed in this DBZ movie.All the things i love about the tv series were missing.I love the long drawn out grueling battles in the series but here they are all over in seconds.The dialogue was pretty poor and the story line very thin,explaining nothing about Turless or his origins.I also hated Gokus voice in this movie.And why oh Why is this movie so short?If even an extra half an hour on were added onto it to beef out the story line and add some much needed action and fight scenes it could have been so much better."
2,Not bad but baaaad!!,Once again Funimation has turned a great Dragonball movie into something really bad. A whole bunch of stuff was edited out. Tree of Might would be better if it was uncut. There are a whole bunch of things that I think Funimation made up. For example: How did the heck did Turles (Taurus in Japanes version) know the name of Gokuh's technique the spirit bomb(Genki Dama in Japanese version)? There are 10 more DBZ movies out there and I hope that they don't mess them up like they did Tree of Might and the other two because movies 4-13 are really good.
1,Dragonball z's dissapointment,"Nasty! This movie was B-O-R-I-N-G! It was so bad, I couldn't watch it all. The whole idea of watching Goku trying to beat up a tree, is a dissapointment. Don't even rent it! This was deffintly the worst Dragonball z movie ever made."
1,Not as advertised,"It says it doesn't require drilling. It does including a 1/8"" hole in the top of the patio door frame. It is complicated to install and kind of flimsy."
5,2006 Stanley Cup Champions!!!!,"Yes we finally did it I'm glad that we won the cup in the new NHL, theses new rules and open ice really helped out the hurricanes with a NHL and Franchise recored braking season all year long two 9 game winning streaks and two five game winning streaks 4 shut outs. I can go on and on. But I rather you watch it first my most exciting playoff series this year was againt's New Jersey, Buffalo to game 7 and also the Edmonton Oilers in game 7 of the stanley cup finals.Cam Ward our rookie goalie who won us the cup gotten the cons smyth e throuphy,and Rod Brind A'Mour took home the best diffensive foward trouphy award.

3,Merlin rocks.,"I met Merlin on 1997 and learned a lot. bought 8 books and later over 100. great give away books on Praise to God. whenwe honor God God Honors us back....His other 2 praise books sold millions, U need them too"
4,"insightful, Humorous","Chuck Meyer offers a witty and insightful commentary on the current and future states of the Christian Church as it fails to acknowledge, let alone keep pace with, the changes of modernity. Meyer critiques the church not as an embittered outsider casting stones but as an member of the Episcopal clergy who finds honest shortcomings with the institutional church. Filled with humor and Hopeful in tone, the book is straight forward in its language without becoming simplistic. A worth while read for those grappling with the desire to remain an active member a Christian while unable to sincerely concur with orthodox theology."
2,"Plenty of theory, few VB examples","I purchased this book with the hope of finding useful snippets of VB code for reading and writing to databases. Unfortunately, while there is plenty of discussion on the SQL foundations for working with databases, there is little help here for beginners using the ""dive right in"" approach."
5,"What is ""Narf""? Would you mind...","Undoubtedly one of the best satirical cartoons ever made, Pinky and the Brain can be viewed as a social commentary, or can be just plain funny. For fans of witty inclusive humor, Orson Welles, or lab mice with ingenious plots - Pinky and the Brain is sure to amuse the TV critic and the couch potato all at once."
5,gift,love it. very entertaining for adults and children. could not stop watching the shows. a very funny cartoon to see.
4,"Pinky and the Brain, Vol. 1","Not quite as funny as I remembered, but I was a lot younger then. It still gets me to chuckle and is more clever than most children's entertainment."
2,Order was incomplete,"The Order was incomplete.There was no CD Rom As advertised, when contacted seller asked if I was sure the disc was not in the box, Seller did not offer partial refund or to pay for the shipping costs of returning the item. The explanation that he was deployed and everything was in storage, was dissapointing to me. What could I say.... This was my third order of this text book specifically for the CD Rom, I would have liked to know up front that the CD Rom was missing.I would have saved some time and $."
4,good read with many facts of the Maya culture,I found this book compelling as to it's historical content. I agree with a previous report that it is in need of serious editing. There are many duplications I found unnecessary.Despite the need of editing I found the intertwining plots refreshing and broke up the course the book takes into the history of different periods.I especially enjoyed the factual information about the characters and locations many of which I have visited.I recommend the book for anyone interested in historical fiction for this region on the world.I do hope the author uses a good editor for the following books.
5,Understanding in the kitchen,"I have found that there are many books on the science of cooking, but none of them are as fun to read as this one was! Finding the best (and most cost effective) way of making awesome food is what Alton excels at.Alton has numerous examples throughout his book of ways he has altered his cookware to fit his needs. These examples are inventive and hilarious (like adding an exhaust pipe and a hair dryer to his grill for the best air flow and ultimately heat). Beyond his cookware he explains why some foods are better than others (say the difference between table salt and kosher salt) and how foods work together giving this book insight helping the reader to be a better cook.The personality of AB that we all know from ""Good Eats"" comes through on every page making this a joy to read. His true love of food combined with his mechanical mind give ""I'm Just Here for the Food"" that unique twist that I feel merits a five star rating!"
5,I was wrong,"I didn't get Alton Brown at first. Ok, let me be blunt - I didn't like him. I watched the channel he is on, but would quickly get annoyed with the weird camera angles and borderline humor and change the channel. Well hindsight has officially kicked in and the man is a culinary genius. I now love his show and this book, although his humor is still borderline. When he is funny though, he is really funny. Anyway, the book is great because the focus is on teaching you on how to cook, not just listing recipes with some glossy pictures. For example, what type of grill is good, why a cast iron skillet, how/ why to braise. In addition, PLENTY of great recipes. I highly recommend the book!"
5,This is my favorite cookbook,"Alton teaches you that cooking is a science, if you follow his formulas, the food will turn out perfectly every time. Anyone can make great meals from his recipes. He gives you differant approaches to old favorite recipes. Something as simple as a baked potato, his method makes an amazing baked potato. I had a party and made all this great food, I made his baked potato because it was easy to keep for a while, everyone complimented me on the potatoes, and ignored the other food.If I could have just one cookbook, this would be it."
5,The science of cooking,"Alton Brown explains the science of cooking but don't be afraid because he manages to explain things clearly and in a way that will not put you to sleep. This book is about learning how things cook and how to apply each cooking method to your morsel of food. It also explains what kind of tools (not gadgets!) you should have in your kitchen -- I just bought my cast iron frying pan! Just like his show, Brown provides a wealth of anecdotes to drive home the point. A must for every kitchen!"
3,Not what I expected,"I was kind of disappointed with this book. It's mainly about the science behind cooking with different kinds of heat. I was hoping this book would also teach me about the science of putting different foods and/or flavors together. I did learn some new things and was entertained while doing so, but unless you are interested in the how's and why's of heating food I wouldn't rush to buy it."
3,Alright book,"This book is all about technique, not about recipes. I was hoping there would actaully be some real recipes in it."
2,Simple book for beginning cooks,"I am surprised by the effusive comments about this book. Now, I Tivo Good Eats and enjoy it as much as anyone ... but unlike Alton's shows which go into reasonable depth on narrow (and often unconventional) topics, this book is too basic to be helpful to an experienced cook, and too shallow to be interesting to the cooking wonk. Now, if you do not know the difference between braising and boiling or the difference between conduction and convection, then you might find the book marginally useful, however there are other books -- some of which Alton himself cites -- which provide more meaningful discussions of the technique or science of cooking. As far as included recipes go, they are few and uninspired, apparently intended primarily to illustrate techniques."
1,Did not receive,I never received this item at all.I definitely would not purchase anythingfrom this seller.
3,An interesting yet mired analysis,"Having spent a portion of my youth in Mississippi, I was certainlyinterested in the notion of a study devoted entirely to the state'sgay 20th century history. Unfortunately, I felt that the book lackedfocus and organization in the presentation of material. Sub-headingsof the book began focused but digressed into unrelated topics. Theshifting of person was bothersome as well. In first person, the bookwas intimate. In third, it was analytical. Swinging both ways jarredthe flow terribly. Howard seemed bound by awkward ... All told, thesubject material was fascinating but lacking in a cohesive andprofessional layout."
4,Push up!!!,"Este bra es un excelente push up! El unico inconveniente es, que los encontre muy ajustados para mi gusto. Mis senos, que son pequeños, se ven increibles con ellos. Compre el negro y el color es muy lindo. Los compraria otra vez, pero en una talla mayor."
5,Funny and insightful,"It's not often that humor is so well done and, yet, makes points that are insightful without being preachy. Ric Browde is clearly intelligent and takes on religion, the media, law enforcement, relationships, the music biz and more in a satiric send up that is simply outstanding.Ric is funny and you can't help but laugh. However, I was compelled to pay attention to the points being made because they were good ones. Through humor Ric gets you to think about things which is always good.This is a good book with a soundtrack too. The song ""I'm stupid and so are you"" is hilarious and along with the rest of the CD that accompanies the book it highlights the story being told and makes you enjoy the process all the more."
3,"Generally a good guide, but . . .","I wonder if Mike has ever actually been to Stone Mountain. The roads and sidewalks are anything but ""predominately flat"" or ""lightly traveled"" on weekends. The terrain is nothing like the Silver Comet Trail. Overall, the routes are good and well described, but some of the information is incorrect, and there are a few areas where I would not run. There are safer places to be in the Atlanta area than downtown, Grant Park, and Westview Cemetery, especially if you are female and alone."
1,Not very good seeds,I was very excited and interested in this plant when I first discovered it. I planted between 6-12 seeds and only have 1 plant growing. I am very disappointed in these seeds.
1,Mentally and technically sloppy writing,"Don't let the name of the great business thinker, Alfred Chandler, an advisor on this book, mislead you about this book. The book is mentally and technically sloppy. Mentally, the comparison of GNP to total corporate receipts is nonsense - ideological pap. The GNP of Israel is less than the corporate receipts for Ford. What does that tell you? Ford has automotive competitors, shareholders and no army --- the comparison is ideologically motivated anti-business nonsense.Technically, among the numerous errors I found, the worst was the statement that Wal-Mart had 60% of the U.S. retail market. Wal-Mart actually has 6% of the U.S. retail market."
4,Dating Rocks,"I totally enjoyed this book. Steve""s style of writing is easy to read and comprehend.A couple of the chapters really hit home and gave me ways to correct my past behavior. I would recommend this book to any woman that is having some dating issues."
4,A look at life in the Mid-South through photography,"Jackson, Tennessee (Madison County) is located ninty miles east of Memphis; a rail, distribution and agricultural center for Western Tennessee.Settled in the late 1700's-early 1800's; this area produced Davey Crockett, many Civil War heroes, Casey Jones, and Carl Perkins.A wonderful look at a fine quality-of-life area that has grown from ""small town"" to the fifth largest city in Tennessee.Emma Inman Williams was not only a shepherd of the book but a layer of the city's foundation.I knew her and loved her."
5,What a great story!!,"What an inspiration!! After seeing the movie ""Miracle"" I had to see this, the actual true story. As a hockey fan, this makes me love the sport even more."
4,Take me back,This is the complete and compelling story of the 1980 U.S. hockey team. The impact their victory had on American citzens at the time can not be measured. The movie makes good use of footage and interviews with the main participants.
4,Beating the Odds,"The author takes us on an odyssee from Strassbourg, when it was still French, to Vienna, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Grenoble, and eventually to the United States where he arrived at the age of 20. The experiences of his family during the Nazi occupation of France are almost too much to bear, and he describes with great clarity how the German war machine affected Europe and his personal life."
4,Great buy for the money!,"Easy setup, very well designed. In fact, I had purchased one of these systems, but it was burned down in a house fire (not due to anything electrical), and found this exact system to replace it. Definite buy!"
2,An educational story of the life of Sir George Martin,"This book is highly informative in what it takes to be a record producer, however, I bought the book becaue I was looking for information about his work with the Beatles. That information is not vast, and he rarely includes them in the book. I was hurt to find that on the cover George portrays himself as the ""genius behind the Beatles"" and shows a picture of himself and the Beatles, yet fails to mention them as he should. If you are looking for information on the recording process this is the book for you, but if you are looking for information about the Beatles I feel you will be disappointed."
5,Wrong Title,"This is one of the best music books I have read by far. Shame about the title, I think it is the publishers' mistake, trying to sell on the Beatles manis. Fact is, that book is about George Martin's incredible understanding of music. He is a genious and it shows that it takes more than talent (Beatles) to make great records. Fantastic book,"
4,Great insight!,"Amazing insight into the life of one of the greatest music producers ever.I would have given it a full 5 stars, but his co-writer failed to fully edit and organize the content. Or maybe she just let him 'go off' so we got a better view into his personality? It could have been written better. I assume that is why non-writers usually have co-writers for their autobiographies.But the content was compelling. I did enjoy it. And I will probably read it again!"
3,Brief and broad,"I chose this book as a follow up to reading Geoff Emericks account of his experiences with the Beatles, Abbey road and George Martin himself. Emerick goes into great detail of day to day working life, relationships between major and minor players and interesting technical tidbits when necessary. I found Martins book to be quite a let down in comparison. Periods and albums were glossed over, anecdotes were rather short and uninteresting and there was little technical or creative detail. All in all it felt like a resume, with a rush to the finish.Had I read this book before Emericks 'Here There and Everywhere' I think I may have been left with a better impression having been eased into the world and work they both experienced. Not a bad read by any means, but unless you are really into Martin I would recommend Emericks book over Martins."
5,more beautiful music from Finland,"Here again comes yet another band from Finland-home of H.I.M, and these guys do not dissappoint!The song ""lonlieness o.d""is a great song,as well as ""darkness between"" and ""destination unknown""""dance"" is already a hit for them-If you like H.I.M get this band, you will love the music!!"
4,Very nice looking,"They look amazing,and work just fine. Only reason I didn't rate a 5 was that one of the latches on the case was broken when I recieved it. Just a word of caution as well, these are super black so if you drop them somewhere dark, they are hard to see/find."
2,Clips broke on first use,The clips that snap the box together broke off the first time I opened the box....I didn't even apply that much force. The tools are functional although they leave quite a residue on your fingers. This is my second and last purchase of a Stanley toll set.
4,High Quality Tools,"This socket set is perfect. I love how it is pre greased and ready for anything. This is difintly something I would recommend to a friend or anyone planing on making an addition to their socket sets.I hated the case since it's really bad plastic and even the screws were plastic, but I don't think I will be keeping my sockets in the case anyway."
5,Madea in Jail,"This film is funny but it makes you look at your relationships as well. Could your best friend really do something like this to you? Keep a watchful eye out. This was also a role reversal, it is usually the women who put their men through school and the men who are usually so heartless that they eventually leave."
5,Another hit for Tyler Perry and Madea!,"I loved this video, as did my family. We are great Tyler Perry fans and his Madea character is so familiar to me. The wisdom, humor and outrageousness of his productions keeps us laughing. We bought authorized copies from Amazon to help support Tyler and say 'no thanks' to the bootleggers. I pray he continues to create wonderful entertainment like this for families everywhere."
2,Not for this family,"Guess I'm in the minority about this, but this PLAY (NOT a MOVIE) left me thinking that I wasted my money. I enjoyed Madea, she is a great character. I never seem to care about the rest of the people or their problems. For me the only thing funny about it was when Madea took the stage, the rest of it was simply boring."
4,Great Story with Lots of Humor,"Madea is one of my favorite characters of all time, so if I see her name, I'll automatically buy anything to do with her. She has a no nonsense look on life that is amusing and refreshing. The characters around her balance her out since they are the serious current of the storyline. Tyler Perry does an excellent job in bringing humor to sensitive situations, and this play didn't disappoint me. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it dragged on during the songs.I applaud Perry for having the courage to confront issues like adultery, unintentional murder of an infant, and loving again after a divorce. Blending humor just makes the play that much more memorable. Life is serious but humor does a body good. I do agree that Madea was the highlight of this play. She is the shining star."
5,Excellent Play,This play was great but you better sit down and have nothing else to do to watch it because its one of the long ones. Still loved it though.
5,MIRACLE,"I like Tyler Perry, his plays, movies, and his inspirations on and about life. This is very positive, and gives laughter to the heart as well as the soul. THANK YOU"
5,20 year memory,"my daughter whom is 22 years old, loved care bear hugs. I didn't save her favorite care bear and through the years she always reminded me of this. They say that history repeats itself, thank goodness! I am buying care bear hugs for my daughter's 23rd birthday this way she can share her childhood memories with her children and they can capture the love of the care bears the same as my daughter did. Thanks for bringing care bears back in the hearts of children of all ages."
3,Low-density book on UDDI,"This book spends a tremendous amount of pages per idea. There is a lot of code in the main text (should be on a digital medium or at least the appendix). And this code is even repeated in .Net and Java.Anyhow:It is a fast and swift read.You get some examples.You do find things you do not find in other books.My best recommendation for UDDI is still the corresponding chapter in Eric Newcomer's Web Services book.This book is part of the Hewlett-Packard Professional books series. Except for the cover design, this is (luckily) not noticeable at all. Well the company employs the authors."
2,"Misleading title, Good for beginners","If you just heard or have never heard of blogging: *****Blood's book is a book about ideas, not the nuts and bolts. Most people can gather what blood has outlined through experience and reading other blogs. She covers great material in a straightforward manner, but this book does not desearve rave reviews.What Blood does great is introduces Weblogging to an audience who might not want to start a blog, but is curious about the culture. Her passion is evident, and for a beginner, absolute-just-heard-of-blogging-and-wants-to-know-more person, this is the perfect book. Conceptually, this book is a great help.If you know or have any experience with bloging, you might try elsewhere, this read might be boring. She gives great examples, but they are difficult to understand because there are no real to life visuals.Great, easy read, okay execution, but not for experienced bloggers."
2,The Graveyard of Bloopers!,"It is called The Graveyard because it the first scene opens in a graveyard where the crime is committed. The following scenes take place in a summer camp and then the movie's final scene close in graveyard where the story trys to come together and end there. There are quite a few big bloopers out in this movie that I cannot believe went by the editting staff. One of the biggest examples is when the cop got knocked over, hit his head on the tombstone, shot and dropped his gun and he was suddenly gone. Not too mention a few others. I seen better acting in Night of The Living Dead zombies than I did in this movie. Most of the script was well written but was ruined by the bad acting."
1,unrealistic and fanciful,"i'm sure if i had millions and my livlihood riding on my appearance i'd be ""SUPERMOTIVATED"" also. unfortunately, i'm an average person with average motivation and this book was a waste of my time."
4,Great & revealing,This album (i have the lp version) is a good showcase of what these english musicians do in a more 'traditional' jazz setting. They are all involved in other more fusion or prog or whatever projects. So this is a good chance to hear them in a striped jazz context produced with top quality ecm sound.
4,A fine debut novel by a talented writer.,"Lelia Kelly's ""Presumption of Guilt"" is a fine legal thriller/police prodecural. Her protagonist is Laura Chastain, a corporate lawyer with a talent for criminal defense work. After getting a high-profile client off the hook, Laura takes on the case of a cop who is accused of killing a suspect. Laura gradually finds out that she has taken on a case that is extremely complex and potentially dangerous. She also becomes romantically involved with an older man with whom she falls deeply in love. Kelly writes dialogue that is funny and sharp. Her plot is fairly tight and engrossing until the end, which is a little too complicated and has one too many coincidences. Having read this book, and the next in the series, ""False Witness,"" I recommend Lelia Kelly's novels to fans of this genre."
2,"Forget the tease, this is a talking head movie",The photo on the cover is just a tease. No such legs appear anywhere in the film. This is basically a talking heads film with three couples coming to grips with divorce and infidelity. Of course in the end everyone forgives and forgets. Only in the movies. You can safely pass on this one.
3,The Neighbor,Rod Steiger was really creepy in this film and much too obvious. It would have been a more interesting film if there had been real mystery and suspense. From the beginning the viewer knew what was going to happen.
2,unnrealistic,"This movie has good acting and a scary plot but it is beyond unrealistic.Who would gleefully use a baby bassinet that had been stored in an attic since the 1940s? Oh sure, they are so happy for this ""gift"" since it's so well preserved having been covered with a sheet for decades.Oh please.............what educated (she is a counselor) seemingly intelligent woman would allow a doctor to casually do an amnio on the spur of the moment? It has been 30 years since I last used OB services but even then, no doctor I had ever heard of ran an office in such a shoddy, unprofessional way.John and Mary move in and don't change the locks. Mary is positive someone is sneaking into the house and punks have broken into their car but even then no thought is given to changing the locks!If you watch this, prepared to roll your eyes at all the unrealistic actions. You would NOT do things that way."
1,Random racing cilps + Techno,"This DVD is a bunch of random clips of racing strung together with some car show models sprinkled in, then set to techno background music. And that's about it."
4,Great product,"I just used this product to wash my car and it worked great. As it is advertised, a little goes a long ways (1 oz per gallon). The suds feel very smooth and lifted dirt off my car with easy. It is also easy to rinse off. And after washing, my car's surface felt slick as well."
5,A delightful read-aloud book,"I am a reading specialist and I shared this book with several classes. They loved it! It is a sweet, fun book."
5,A Review of Juan by Karl Price,"This is a gripping tale that becomes all the more poignant with the realization that it is a true story. I had the privilege of knowing Juan because Karl Price happens to be my uncle. One might say that this would color my thinking of the book and therefore this review, but, being one who also likes to write, I think the book is very well-written. Writing it in the first person, with Juan telling his own story, makes it all the more heart-wrenching. I was captured anew by the pain and frustration experienced by those that I knew and loved, even as I learned many details for the first time. I highly recommend the book and hope that many people read it. It is a story that needs to be told."
4,Excellent portable bassinet,"This is an excellent portable bassinet. It is a must have for parents on the go. It is very easy to open and close. My two month old daughter just loves sitting in it. However, there are two downsides to this item: 1) it does not come with a carrying case, and 2) the baby cannot see the stars twinkling in a well lit room."
1,Buy Bodyguard from Beijing - Not The Enforcer,"...P>This film was originally called The Bodyguard from Beijing. This film has been cut by 2 mins and has a dreadful dubbed audio instead of subtitles. If you buy this movie you are only supporting the likes of Dimension getting their hands on more movies and doing the same again. If only they would be respectful with their releases like Hong Kong Legends and Celestial.on a further point, this is not even in Jet Li's top 10 movies, it is very weak. ..."
3,"u should get the subtitled version, not this","Why not get this dubbed version? because they changed basically the complete story in this version. Get the subtitled one somewhere because it contains the original story, music, scenes, etc. Trust me, when you compare the dubbed with the subtitled, u'll like the subtitled better. the subtitled version is called ""Bodyguard from Beijing"" and in this dubbed it's called ""The Defender"". Though this dubbed is still good, i recommend the subtitled version."
5,Must read for ladies who got dumped!!!,"broke up with bf...but i clinged to hope that we can become lovers again... read ""how to get our lover back"" by blase harris...he provided gd suggestions in his book...but didn't work on my stubborn ex...we became friends...we slept...then now what...finally i think enough is enough....talked the last time and i threw my temper and broke his door...finally went to bookstore and suddenly this book caught my attention...in the book it mentions not to do anything violent or will regret later....well...still i'm not regret about breaking the door...but the book really is written for chic ladies who wanna live a better live...we rock ladies"
4,Classic Speedboats with a continental flavour!,"This book was originally published in France. Sometimes its translation from French has to be read through. Other than that, this is an excellent book with excellent period and contempory photography. If you are interested in ""Classic Speedboats"" with a European bent on history, this is one fine source book."
3,Love Is in the Earth: A Kaleidoscope of Crystals,"I bought this book years ago and found it at first useful to some extent. But you really have to intuitively pick through the words to find the gems and the relevance to the crystals' use in your particular situation in order to use it to full effect.One passage in the lengthy explanation might be all that you needed to know, and all that is relevant. That might be difficult for those with less developed intuitive skills.The book focuses on positives only, so you don't get some of the other information available, but just ok for beginners who want a basic reference and don't need a pictorial guide."
4,Great movie! I would give it 5 stars if it were widescreen,"SHORT REVIEW: This is an awesome movie if you like this sort of thing. It is a nice, clean print, but it's presented in full screen which seems to be the only way to get it on DVD. If it were in widescreen, I wouldve given it 5 stars. These Australian Corman flicks from Umbrella Entertainment always have at least a few good extra features and such nice looking packaging!That's all folks!"
3,French stuff,"The record is very well produced, but as is usually the case with French rock music, it somehow does lack bite and inspiration. Ok she was in Stinky Toys and in Elli & Jacno who did some decent stuff but I am not completely convinced about this stuff. The stuff that is sung is English is actually of slightly higher quality than the rest. The whole thing starts with the pretentious arty cover photo of herself. I am somewhat irritated."
2,Okay,"THis movie was okay, but a little too disgusting. THe woman that wanted them to close the place down was so funny! She walked around outside screaming: WE WANT CLOTHES...WHERE Do WE WANT THEM? ON OUR WIATRESSESS! iT was funny but the movie has to much sexual involvement!"
3,Good but expensive,The clothing change scenes featuring nudity are unnecessary and do not forward the plot. The ladies are beautiful but it's price is a bit too high for what you are getting.
3,"Cheap, but kind of small","The 1st thing of this bag is its price. If you have a lot of cheap raquets to store, it's a good fit. But if you want extra protection like have a cover on your raquet, you'll find this bag is a little small. Of course it can fit in, but definitely not 10 raquets with covers:)The logo mimics THE ""macgregor golf"" but they are totally different. Again, if you dont have expensive raquets, this bag is highly recommended. Otherwise, choose a brand name."
5,A must have for MsAccess programmers,"Daily employed subjects, very good explaineds and an useful INDEX to found what you need. That is aplicable to the whole serie ""Access xxx Developer's Handbook"". I own all of them!. The best books about MsAccess."
5,A great shopping experience,"thanks to the vendor. I ordered this product one week prior to vacation and didnt expect it to arrive in time but, it did."
2,I fail to see the point,"Tehanu can only be described in one simple word: boring. It takes a very long time for the plot to thicken in this book; the characters are so deeply developed that the author leaves little room for an actual plot. The ending of the book is very unsatisfying, it left me asking ""Now what?"" I also found the dialog of the characters choppy, and difficult to comprehend. However, I do like how deeply the characters WERE developed, despite the terrible plot. I also really enjoyed the concept of there being a central character that is actually female. (Rarely does a science fiction book dare do this.) Tehanu is a book not about setting and external circumstances (like most sf) but of the deep, emotional conflicts of human nature. It's really too bad that this awesome concept was presented in such a boring, pointless way."
2,what was that?,"I read all the other books and thought they were great, but for some reason I couldn't follow this book. I had to keep rereading every thing she wrote. This book just couldn't keep my attention."
1,"If you don't like books with a plot, this one's for you.","After reading Tehanu, I decided to check the reviews here. After seeing a number of 5* rankings, I wondered what I had missed. So I reread it. I came to the conclusion that I didn't miss a thing. You can skip to the last 12 pages of the book and not only not miss any action, but also understand the overall point. After droning about the nature of female power for what seems like an eternity, she puts us out of our misery with an anticlimactic non-event.Terry Goodkind has the same intrinsic problem in that he writes diatribes about the evils of communism. However, formulaic as his books are, they at least have plots. I find it tragic that she abused a beautifully developed (and best-selling) fantasy trilogy to write a treatise on feminism.The first three books of the series were very enjoyable. I would recommend them to anyone who likes fantasy. I would recommend this one to anyone who needs a bird cage liner."
4,A foggy gem,"This book is a foggy gem. When you first look at it, it's nothing terribly glamorous, nothing all that thrilling, but gazing deep into it, it begins to make you wonder. And the more you stare into the gem, the more you realize its hidden beauty, its poignant depths.Enough with the metaphors though. I did like this novel, but in a reserved and thoughtful way. It is extremely different from the trilogy, almost in the way a good epilogue is, when all the ends are being tied, and the characters you've come to love are dissapearing with the words on the page. So if you only like exciting, quick-paced adventure, you shouldn't touch Tehanu with a ten-foot pole, but if you like passionate writing about the ordeals of finding yourself, finding your own beauty, then you should love this book."
3,"decent book, but tarnishes the trilogy","I first read this book when it was published, several years after reading the original trilogy, and quite liked it. However, when I later read all four books in a row, I found it quite painful. I think the author must have had some feminist doubts about her first books, which led her to write this one. However, I think the author misread her own work, and was too vindictive towards it. The earlier books were chauvinistic only in the incidental sense of being set in an old-fashioned world. The sexual innocence of the trilogy is part of its charm. I had no trouble identifying with Ged as a girl, because his identity as a male was not emphasized- he was a wizard, a hero, a human being, but not a man. To introduce the mushy complications of sex and gender politics into Earthsea is like dropping a crystal vase into a mud puddle."
4,Some shining moments.,"I've read the first four books of this series and overall am very impressed with the author's ability to have the reader ""live"" the charcters life almost without knowing one has been drawn in. This book though, like book two, The Tombs of Atuan, is one that has less magic and ""historical"" adventurous intensity than the others. That's o.k. if your flexable in your tastes.I agree with the disappointed reviewer that there are departures from what was to be expected given the previous book. Also, there are some more ""modern"" expressions that take the reader out of the antique setting and mood. Even given that it is an interesting ""chapter"" in the series. I came online to order the next book. Enjoy."
4,A mature book for all ages,"Billing this book as the fourth of the Earthsea books was not fair. The tone, the style, and the subject matter were immensely different. That said, it is a wonderful and concise commentary on heroism, fantasy, and the winding down of a long life. It was fascinating to watch LeGuin taking a new look at the characters of the Earthsea books while remaining true to their original incarnations. However, the book is not without flaws. The plot relied too much on otherwise clever characters ignoring obvious indications of wrongdoing, and the end relied on a deus ex machina. It was still completely enjoyable."
5,What are you expecting for?,"For most of those people who had read the Earthsea Cycle, and expect to read the same kind of story as the former three, this book will certainly disappoint them, unless they could manage this new sort of narrative that Le Guin uses. Yes, you'll find magic and power, and even myth, but not as a mere fantasy tale; Tehanu bets for a moral, feministic and even ordinary story, for it is within an ordinary environment, as life itself. However, don't you think Tehanu is kind of boring, for it's exactly the opposite: it makes you think about the order of certain things, about prejudices we take as truth.Conclusion? If you want to read a different novel, within the environment of Earthsea, then you will like Tehanu."
1,LeGuin attempts to destroy her own creation,"What a surprise Tehanu turned out to be! I got the impression when I read this book that LeGuin, much later in her life, regretted making the heroic male character Ged in her Earthsea Trilogy, and so she added this novel to destroy Ged. Through out this novel, we are treated to endless, tiresome scenes of an impotent and useless Ged. It seems that LeGuin wants to shove into our face: ""See! See! Ged is a whiny, useless man! He is nothing like the noble, likable character you thought you knew. Oh no. Ged is an evil man, and all men are bad, bad, bad!"" It really is unrelenting in its portrayal, there is nothing enjoyable or lighthearted or redeeming in the entire book. After reading this book, my impression is that I would never want to meet Ursula LeGuin, because she sure seems like a bitter person."
1,Bad,"Ignore all those people who have said this book is a mature philosophical work about women. I do not deny that Miss Le Guin is an astounding writer but the truth of the matter is the Earthsea Trilogy does not need this tacked on, pointless little book. The characters from the previous books are not shown as broken down and dispirited as they are not remotely the characters from the previous books. What Le Guin has written is a turgid, kitchen sink drama about a couple that live on a farm with some child abuse and sex thrown in. There is none of the magic of the first three books and this book is simply not worth reading. Avoid at all costs."
1,This book deserves a Negative rating.,"The single worst book of Fantasy, ever.The depths of how bad this book are can hardly be expressed. It is in no way shape or form Fantasy, that it is marketed as such is a travesty of misinformation.Do yourself a favor, don't make your mind suffer in pain from reading this.If only the trees that went to print this novel in all editions could be brought back . . ."
3,Very flimsy,I guess they'll work ok. Easy to install but you have to take the wheels off to drill the holes
4,"Good, early stereo, Bruckner 7th","I recently won a 25 album (over 30 lps all in great shape) Bruckner lot at Ebay. Among the the Albums were Bruno Walter (4, 7, 9) Jochum, Bohm, Furtwangler, Tennstedt, Schuricht, etc. There are a lot of good Bruckner performances in great sounding stereo that are out of print and hard to find or were never ported over to CD. It is nice to have the LP option.As far as I know, Klemperer recorded 4 thru 9 with the Philharmonia/New Philharmonia Orchestras and I have all of these except #5 which is somewhat rare and hard to find at a reasonable price. I have enjoyed all of these LPs.This 7th is very good, though not my favorite. Both Karl Bohm's and especially Bruno Walter's 7ths are very hard to beat."
4,Great historic analysis on military innovations,It is a very good review on how things developed between world wars. It provides a good insight of the thinking of the different countries and how they coped with their doctrines and how much they took an advantage of the WWI experiences.I am rating 4 stars because actually I would like much more information rather than 30 pages on each subject.
5,Great piece of furniture,"I ordered this to go with my farmhouse table, hoping that they would match. To my delight, the bend matched my existing table perfectly! It's sturdy, attractive, and a great addition to our dining room!"
4,Sturdy and well built,Order the bench to match a similar style table I already had. The bench matched perfectly and does not feel flimsy or wobbley. I really liked that it came with soft plastic protectors on the bottom of the feet so it doesn't scratch my floors.
1,An Affront to Intelligent Readers,"If you want to read a book about Alaska, this is not one to consider! I was amazed that such a reputable writer would publish a story that repeatedly betrays complete ignorance of Alaskan geography, culture, and history. Imagine reading a book written about your home state by someone who seems never to have looked at a map of it, much less visited it or made the least effort to learn its history. I was appalled! If I could have rated this one with negative stars, I would have."
2,"Some Photos, But Generally Uninteresting","This paper contains no noteworthy text, although there are some sketches and photographs (some aerial) that some researchers might find of interest.I attained my.pdf copy of this paper from Archive.org. The photographs in both versions available on that site were not particularly clear, although I suppose that might be a function of the computer monitor I am using.If you are interested in early articles on Cahokia you would do much better with Mooreheads 1922 paper:::The Cahokia Mounds: A Preliminary Paper (1922).Pam T.PageinHistory.com"
3,Okay but could've been better,The book was okay but I think that Jamie was quick in putting judgement on Barclay. She instantly thought he could've been guilty from the first accident when she should've also questioned the other members of the club. That is why I give it 3 stars. A real detective would've also questioned the other members.
3,Interesting little mystery,"While there is a gimmick to go with this book, it wasn't that bad. Other than a lot of repetitive descriptions and conversations, it was a fun read. Jamie was a likable character even though her friends and family weren't the best. The author's descriptions of small-town X-mas was great."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"The book was average at best. It took awhile to get interested in, but the pace did pick up about halfway through the book. The plot is good; however, the writing style is a bit elementary. I had the strong urge to take a red pen and edit it."
5,Best Deck Ever!,"I purchased this deck back in 1997. It's the best deck I've ever used. There is a cat on ever single card, and the cats seem to give more meaning to rest of the imagery. The backs of the cards have a really nice hypnotic design that almost reminds me of the artwork of Shag (google him if you don't know who he is).I've used this deck for countless readings, and the results are always detailed and insightful. The booklet that comes with the cards is interesting, but I never use tarot card booklets. For me, it's better to study the imagery on the cards and deduct my own meanings.Booklet or no booklet, these cards are great."
4,Pretty good,"I like these cards, they're beautiful and easy to read. The Traveler's Guide is amusing and a good guideline for making your own magickal world, like mine, Dhniria. I dislike that they don't describe the cards in real detail, but otherwise, fine. One word of advice: these cards may not suit you, they are very elaborate and cat-themed. Sometimes you just can't read decks that don't suit you, get what I mean??? Also, as the reviewer before me pointed out, these are in different worlds, but I find that they're more similar to real life than you might think."
5,Love These Labels!,"Dymo labels work great for both home and business use. They are easy to load, hold up well, adhere to a number of different surfaces."
1,advertized to support mac os x? I think not,"when I purchased this unit, it had been advertized to support mac os 9.x and higher (including mac os x). what I got caused my notebook (g3 lombard with OS X 10.4.10) to crash immediately upon plugin.adaptec has no information on their site regarding this card. I will be contacting amazon to get my money back or trade for a SUITABLE replacement that will work with my machine!"
1,Name brand not worth anything,"Thanks very much to loosenut Don's review. Before I read his review, I spent two hours trying to find the right adapter online, ended up with the Radio Shack 273-1775 1000mA 12v Power Adapter and the Type H adaptaplug. Seems to work as well as the one Don mentioned. I am now charging my Ipod with this contraption. However, when I first tried it I had the Adaptaplug in the wrong position. I was about to give up when I read Don's advice. Thanks Don! Nevertheless I agree with all the negative reviews of this device. This same card is marketed and labeled under at least a dozen different brands (including SIIG). I went with the Adaptec thinking its long history and name brand might add up to something. Think again. Adaptec aint what it used to be, no way!"

5,bottle rack,I had seen a few bottle racks but they didn't seem to strong the one I received is strong and sturdy with 4 bottles in it.
2,Be Careful Buying This,"I ordered this water stand out of a magazine. When it arrived I put it together only to be very disapointed. One thing you will soon notice, is that. The water bottles will soon begain to leak in this laying down position. Another thing is pulling the bottle from the second or third shelf can be quite a task. And still another, the screws that came with mine, didn't go in all the way, not to mention the whole thing was very uneven until it had weight on it, and that problem couldn't be fixed. Needless to say. I ended up returning this water stand. The only good thing I can say about this stand is. That it looks good in your kitchen, but have a mop handy."
5,very nice,I bought this product to keep order of the bottles. We usually kept them in the basement so it wasn't an eye sore. Now we keep them in the dining room which is more convenient. Sturdy does it's job.
1,Poorly Made,"Poorly made. Holes do not line up, making proper assembly difficult to impossible. Also, one of the nuts didn't have any threads, making it useless. In the end, it took me half an hour of struggle to get this thing mostly assembled."
3,a little disappointed,wonderful product as far as the use and space saving - a little disappointed with the product when I opened the box the item had rust all over it. I had it shipped outside of the USA - therfore too much trouble to send it back.
4,Great CD - I love the 80's,"I grew up in the 80's everytime i listen to this CD is brings back memories. The CD if full of Great Artist, and the most Popular songs of that time. Great buy"
5,Glad I bought it!,"Amazing insight. You are not alone. many stories shared of pain and suffering by our own Government.Thank you.Lisa Black vs Dept of Veterans Affairs(United States District Court,Middle District of Tennessee,at NASHVILLE) 2005....and stalling.(Pro-se) Lisa P. Black[...]"
2,Duke Hand Pliers,I felt like I had trouble getting it to actually break the shell. Tried several times ended up giving them away. Also didn't seem to crack the shell leaving pecan in tact.
2,Duke Nut Sheller,Very poor workmanship ruined an otherwise great product.When the product arrived it was unusable. I had to refit the blades because metal was left in the blade seats from the machining that did not allow the blades to seat properly. The shoulder screw was not seated for the plier hinge and the blades were so roughly sharpened that there were huge burs hanging on the back and they were completely dull. I happened to have the skills to make the repairs and turn it into a great tool but for someone without those skills this product would have been useless out of the box! Unless you have metal working skills better not buy this sheller.
1,Old recordings with poor quality,"I would not recommend purchasing this CD to anyone. I listened to it once the day I received it in the mail. The sound quality is terrible. The volume is inconsistent and goes from loud to quiet and back and makes you dizzy listening to it. I thought this would be a great live recording to hear the beauty of her voice. Instead, the quality is so poor that I could not finish listening to the CD. My husband has more tolerance for live recordings and he was not interested in it either."
3,Rushed to press,"I returned this book after a quick skim because it doesn't add anything more than what first appeared in the AE article. I too, was there; from TAA Champion ""all the way"" to Ar Ramadi. Other attention to detail nits: the author didn't fix some of the misspellings of names that first appeared in the article, plus the photo on the FRONT jacket is even reversed.Save yourself the coin, if you want an adequate overview of what we did in phase II and phase III ops, read the magazine article."
2,Not what it appears to be,"This book is a dissappointment, mainly because it fails to deliver. It is more about what a reporter did in Iraq than what the soldiers did. It has very few details about the actual fighting, and is in the end pretty boring."
5,GO MAVS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I'LL BUY THIS IF THE MAVS WIN. THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST PLAYOFFS IN MY LIFETIME SO I CANT WAIT FOR THE FINALS. GO MAVS!!!!!!!!!!
4,S1 and S2 Full-screen plus 3-D in WS,"As the description says - Shrek 1 and 2 are full-screen limited versions (similar to the $19.00 special releases before the 2-disc sets come out). Shrek 3-D is a wide-screen short. The bonus disc has some added music video games and stills.For me, it was an inexpensive way to get all 3 quickly, but really you should be getting the WS versions for full content."
2,No Widescreen? What Gives?,"First off, Brett - Stuff it! I'm stuck with a 13"" television with no remote and I still prefer watching Widescreen over full screen. In a lto of movies it makes a alot of difference. Especially in comedies where there's something happening in the background off to the sides. fullscreen versions just leave off a lot of jokes or interesting points in movies.I saw this set in stores and picked it up. I was really excited until I scrutinized the box (I've learned to do this before I buy a DVD) and finally found in REALLY smal print the specifications. I was really dissapointed to learn that There is no Widescreen (not even an anamorphic widescreen) version of this Box set. Why Dreamworks would do this is beyond me. I really wanted to get that bonus disc though which sounded good, but I already have Shrek 3-D and I'm not about to pay $40 bucks for one stupid bonus disc. I'll wait to see if they correct this huge flaw after the next movie and a Trilogy set comes out."
4,pacific beauty,this is an excellent book on the pacific shore this also a fairly good size cofee table book so i would recomend this book to anyone who has seen how beautiful the pacific coast is
1,LOW Quality - Flimsy and Cheaply Made,"These are very low quality, and I would NEVER buy them again. They are very thin and flimsy. Nowhere near OEM quality."
3,"Loud, weird sole construction, but pretty comfortable","The soles seems to be made of a laminated hard material with glued-on bits of rubber in the middle. As a result, they sound like heels on a hard surface. Also, if the sole is not perfectly flush with the ground, then one loses all traction as the hard sole turns into a sled surface - really dangerous on tile and wet ground. The laminate on the hard sole wears off resulting in a sole that shows large white wear spots. In addition, they installed some kind of a weird cantilever inside the sole so my foot keeps moving within the shoe as I am walking. In spite of all the above flaws, they are ok for the price I paid - they put up with my 2-3 mile walks/day and still feel comfortable."
4,No Laughing Matter,"Tony's mellow vocals get some very solid support from the musicians on these sessions. The playing is very good. There are a few Broadway inflections, but mostly Tony sounds like a square Chet Baker. He goes for more big moments than Baker every tried, but has none of Chet's cool mystique. Still, this is a respectable album, very enjoyable and not simply some curio."
5,tattoo book,got it as a gift for my tattoo artist husband. it arrived on time and he was pleased with the material.
5,Russian Criminal Tattoo Encyclopida,"This book happens to be out of print and gaining value everyday. If you have the $ to spend its quite the addition to any book collection. Heart breaking story's of sorrow, misery, love, hate and much more. This book was also what inspired the director of Eastern Promises to re-write his script. If you find this book interesting, I suggest buying the DVD ""Mark of Cain"""
2,Science fiction with supernatural tendencies,A galaxy in flames is the kind of book that you read like you would grap red twizzlers. You do it without thinking because that is what the author want you to do. Kind of fun but lacks any sembelance of Hard Science Fiction.
4,Good stuff,"Ben Counter makes a solid and well written contribution to the Horus Heresy Series in this fascinating book. The series itself is compelling because it deals with such vital issues in the 40K universe, so I am looking forward to seeing who will write the next volumes. Galaxy in Flames is a fine read, although I have a preference for the slighly more epic tone of Abnett's work. This one is certainly an improvement on McNeil. Keeping my fingers crossed for another one by Abnett or one by Goto."
2,Not a hit,This one is not a hit with my 11 month old. She never lets me go past page 1 and then it's off to get another book. Cute story though.
3,Toddler approved,"I cannot say this is one of my favorite books. Reading ""Little Nutbrown Hare"" and ""Big Nutbrown Hare"" aloud is a bit cumbersome and I often change the names to make for a smoother read. I agree with others that it is a bit annoying that the ""parent"" in the book is always ""one upping"" the ""child"" and not giving a proper praise to the child. However, I am an adult and can over-analyze these things. My toddler loves this book. She likes to participate in the actions of holding her arms out, reaching her toes and hopping. She likes ""smaller"" and ""bigger"" and the book has bunnies and a moon. It is toddler approved and mommy ok-ed."
3,"Wordy, not a favorite","I know this is a classic and very warmly regarded, but I just can't see the magic of this book. We've had it a long time and -- at 15 months -- our son still doesn't last more than a page or two on this one. It's wordier than I'd expected, has a lot of black and white line drawings (not terribly engaging for the younger set). It's repetitive, but not in the positive way a lot of books seem to be. I've got to think maybe this is just better suited for an older child? Have tried it repeatedly with our boy and he just isn't interested. For a young toddler, there are better options that will engage and hold interest better. Honestly, there are other books that also have similar messages that are superior too. I would recommend thumbing through this one before you purchase to see if it's something your family is interested in."
3,Great for older toddlers,"I picked this book out for my one year old son thinking it would be a great sit-down-and-snuggle book. It's got a sweet story line great for bedtime. One problem: my son sits through the first 2 1/2 pages and is ready for some other book. It is not the kind of book that ""grabs"" really young ones. The colors aren't eye catching and trying to make the book slightly entertaining for my lil boy only made me tongue tied. You try to read aloud a book with ""little nutbrown hare"" and ""big nutbrown hare"" in every other sentence and your tongue ceases to cooperate with you."
3,its ok,"this is a cute book, but my son isn't really interested in it and its kind of long for him. i don't think we ever get though the whole thing, he loses interest and we move on to another book."
1,Guess How Much I'm Better Than You,"""Little Nutbrown Hare"" tries to tell ""Big Nutbrown Hare"" how much he loves him, in which BNBH uses it to show how much better he can do things than LNBH. A less secure little bunny would have retreated into a corner after the Big Hare's refusal to acknowledge how big his son's love is for him. Not big enough?Not a good example of how people should relate to others, much less fathers to sons.The author is also showing us how much better they are by being too sophisticated to use baby words like Daddy, bunny, or baby. It's too wordy for the age range."
2,"Tired of saying ""Nutbrown Hare""",There are more enjoyable books out there to read to your children. I stopped reading this book because I was so sick of saying Little Nutbrown Hare and Big Nutbrown Hare.
5,A STORY TO SHARE AND REMEMBER...,"Not since Robert Munch's, ""I'll Love You Forever"" (popular in the 1980's) have I seen such a delightful and touching children's book all about love. The beautiful bond between Big Nutbrown Hare and Little Nutbrown Hare will warm your heart and make you want to hug your child again and again just to show your never-ending love. The illustrations are enchanting and the message is one you and your child will be able to share and remember long after childhood becomes a distant memory. Open your arms ""this.......wide,"" and show your child just how big your love truly is. This book brings out the little child in all of us and is deserving of five stars and more."
3,Maybe for older kids?,"My 19 month old received this as a first birthday gift. She has never been interested in it and will not sit through the entire book, even if I make most of the text up as I go. Maybe as an older child she will grow to like it, but so far, she has not been interested in it at all."
5,My favorite children's book,"My daughter and I still ""love you all the way to the moon and back"" every night. She is 12yrs old."
3,"You try saying ""nutbrown hare"" that many times!","Why in God's name the author chose to call thse characters ""Nutbrown"" hare's instead of just ""brown"" hares is beyond me! You try reading this book to a small child quickly before they fall asleep and saying ""little nutbrown hare"" or ""big nutbrown hare"" without getting tongue tied. I've had to revise this when reading to my daughter to say just ""brown hare"", because I get too tongue tied.This is such a cute story, but the colors are very muted in the pictures and I'm not sure my daughter really enjoy's looking at them because of this."
2,One-sided and simplistic account of Bosnian war,"Peter Maas' book is certainly fast-paced, exciting and full of interesting anecdotes from the war in Bosnia. However, it's also a very simplistic and one-sided description of the Bosnian war, casting Serbia and the Serbs as nationalistic aggressors and the Muslims and Croats as innocent victims. Maas fails to mention that ethnic cleansing, torture of prisoners, massacres of civilians and political manipulation was also perpetrated by the Croatian and Muslim, factions in this brutal civil war. In place of any real analysis of the causes, events and results of the war Maas gives the reader emotionally gripping anecdotes. Rather than describing the complicated reality of the war he prefers to present it as a clear cut case of 'good guys' vs 'bad guys'. In many ways, this book is very typical of US media accounts of the Bosnian civil war in that it is very obviously written from a Muslim point of view. -Oskar-"
1,Sold Half of the Product,"This was supposed to be a gift for my fiance but when I got it one of the disc's was missing, and when I returned it- late (my fault i guess) I only got a partial credit!!!!"
2,"Go back to sleep Elric, dream no more","I'm sorry, I love Moorcock, I really enjoyed Dreamthief's Daughter, and Elric is probably my favourite fantasy character of all time, but this book was just plain horrible to read.It might have something to do with the fact that the subject matter and locales (Native American) are of no interest to me, but on top of that, the characters seemingly do nothing the entire time except travel around talking about the fauna.Elric makes probably his most transparent appearance of any story thus far, floating around as if a ghost, where even his typical brooding becomes nothing more than just annoying banter.The most interesting character of the story, however, is Gunnar The Doomed (Gaynor), a viking looking for gold and conquest in Niffleheim. I wish that the whole book was actually about him and not Ulric, Oona, and Elric."
3,Sturdy rack--needs better accessories,"This was one of the few rear rack options that would fit around disc brakes and carry a decent load (unlike the seat post mounted racks). It is quite sturdy; however, a fair number of modifications were necessary to make it work on my Cannondale MTB. The curved connector was too short to make it anywhere near my rear stays. I ended up getting some Tubus seat stay adapters and a 13"" old man mountain stay to make it work. The included stay adapters would have worked, but the T-shaped mounts looked terrible. It would be nice if Axiom included instructions but their web sites claims that they want it professionally installed--come on. It would also be nice if Axiom either included or separately sold either a variety of straight stays or an adjustable one. It would allow it to be mounted on just about any mountain bike."
1,Ignore the positive reviews,"Don't buy this junk it's horrible: the eyelets for connecting to the bike are positioned incorrectly so that they won't fit on your bike right and will damage the paint. It's heavy, on top of it and worse, there is a piece stuck in mine that rattles around. Clearly a hatchet job item."
2,OK,"Perhaps it was late and I was tired, but this film did not seem as great as the star lineup seemed to promise. I went to sleep while they were in the Hall of Past Lives - ok, having Shirley MacLaine introducing was pretty brilliant."
4,very sharp,"Very, very funny film, the opening bit, the song Brooks plays on the radio, sings to, right before his demise, one of the funniest of this type scene -- the driving down the road singing to the radio scene -- I have ever seen. Inspired music choice (all I'll say is it's Streisand).Rip Torn has a wonderful performance here, all the performances are good, my only complaint is Streep's character. Just don't believe she'd fall romantically for Brooks. (Not even Streep's that good an actress.) Some great bits in this, though, some very dry writing and direction, good unexpected moments. Even Brooks's incessant whining, or whiningness, doesn't get to you much. Maybe cause he's dead."
5,Great Movie!,Has become one of my favorite movies great storyline and the chemistry between albert brooks and meryl streep is wonderful!
2,Or should the title have been FEAR STRIKES OUT?,"With a film titled DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, wouldn't you think it will be about someone who has to defend his wrong actions on Judgement Day? Instead, it throws a curve. Without giving away the story, DEFENDING YOUR LIFE is not about a lowlife (dishonest car salesman or philandering husband) who has to sweat out his deeds in the afterlife. I think that would have been funnier than what the film turned out to be. At least DEFENDING YOUR LIFE wasn't predictable."
5,Beautifully Written,"Sherry Simpson's prose is fantastic. Her thoughts are insightful and interesting. The author uses the native animals of Alaska to describe the Alaska Experience and her own personal experiences. Each page was a revelation of what I love about Alaska as well as why. Sherry has the ability to write from any perspective, and to show reality by combining factual references with her own experiences and exposing two sides to every question. She obviously has a passion and it shows in her work. Very ""personally"" thought provoking."
4,punk as it should be...,"wow. six cd's jam packed with classic punk...yeah, there's no green day, rancid, or pennywise. why? cause it's a punk cd. not popunk. it's pure punk; working class drunkards with guitars and drums. to really appreciate punk (of any generation) you have to have this set. these bands gave birth to, and raised punk...unfortunately it grew up to be a tantrum-throwing teen with no meaning, but you can't blame these guys. they did it good."
4,seminal,probably worth getting just for the stranglers 'go buddy go' andsham 69s 'if the kids'. embarrasingly shows modern punk asoverly polished and amputated.
3,A Decent Read,"I love the novels of Carolyn Haines, and I did enjoy this one once it got going. I'm not much of one for romantic suspense, so this may be why I didn't care for this as much as her other novels. it is well written and does keep you guessing and reading. I enjoyed it but I think it could have been done in fewer words."
4,Great Monitor,"I have had this monitor for a year and a half and I have to say that I love it. I can carry it outside while my son is sleeping and be able to hear him perfectly. I also have a fan on in his room and although the fan is very near the monitor in the baby's room - it's not picked up so severly that you cannot hear the baby. I love that there are 2 monitors so I can leave them around the house and not carry them with me, but they have the option to run on battery (which actually can last surprisingly long) so I can unplug them if I want to. GREAT MONITOR (some interference from cell phones if directly in front of the monitor)...but now I am expecting baby #2 and am not sure if this monitor will work with no intereference in 2 rooms..."
4,"beautiful voice, emotionally suggestive","This is the first Gloria Lynne album I acquired, and I was quite surprised. I'd been a serious Sarah Vaughan fan for some time, and was immediately struck by the fact that Gloria has a richness to her voice reminiscent of Sarah, but with an emotional charge that Sarah does not have. This is not to suggest that they sound alike, or that one is better than the other, although I've come to consider Gloria the equal of Sarah, though Sarah knew much greater fame. However, what I like about this Lynne album, and the others I've listened to is her emotional, slow, and faintly soulful take on songs. Also, there is a certain doubt in her voice too that I enjoy, a doubt in her abilities perhaps, or a doubt in the worth of life."
5,Maxell tape backup,These tapes were for Sysgen 8150 SmartImage streaming QIC and other similiar drives.Higher storage amounts up to 60Gb are possible with data compression.
3,Traditional,"""Nafas"" was recorded in Oslo in February of 1988. Rabih Abou-Khalil relies more on rhythms then he did on his prior release ""Between Dusk And Dawn"". In addition, this album is much more traditional, and lacks the improvisation of the previous release. For me, this wasn't quite up to the level of his prior work, but it is still worthwhile. ""Window"" and ""Incantation"" are my two favorite tracks.On ""Nafas"" the musicians are: Rabih Abou-Khalil (oud), Selim Kusur (nay, voice), Glen Velez (frame drums), and Setrak Sarkissian (darabukka)."
2,Needlessly complex,"There is no reason this textbook should be this poorly written and edited. The point of any textbook is to clearly and concisely teach. ""What The Numbers Mean"" reflects neither clarity nor is it concisely written. Accounting is a fairly straightforward discipline and should be communicated as such."
4,Memoirs Of A Smart Alec,"Having already read Henry Alford's previous book MUNICIPAL BONDAGE, I was already aware that Mr. Alford was a smart alec, and I am happy to report that in BIG KISS he still is. Hooray and halleluja! Alford's comic relections on his quixotic forays into the theater are a joy to behold. This is a light and funny book that I read in one sitting. Henry Alford should have his own adjective, and it should require special spelling! Here's hoping we don't have to wait six years until his next book."
2,looking for ideas or a solution,I have one of these and i am not getting any power through to the plugs. is there a fuse in it somewhere?
1,Junk for the landfill,"I bought the unit in October of 2009 to replace my 20 year old Radio Shack unit that had too few functions. I used the unit to install two remote photovoltaic power systems in a remote area of Mexico in December of 09 and for occasional system testing every few months. The unit was kept in an air and water tight bag with a desiccant when not in use. One year and two months after purchase, the unit is dead. Yes, I put a new battery in and know the board is getting power.I realize this is not a higher end tester but death two months out of warranty with little only light and by the book use is pretty sick."
3,Serves the purpose,"If you need a case to protect your RAZ phone this is as good as any other. It serves the purpose. Nothing spectacular, nothing bad. Just middle of the road."
4,Just what I wanted!,"I searched high and low for a case with a removeable clip with no luck until I was directed to Amazon. I should have begun my search there. Not only does it have the type of clip that I wanted (removeable!) but as an added bonus the material used by Body Glove allowed my Razr to mantain its thin profile. One bit of advice, don't make a habit of removing the case as it will cause the elastic on the side to loosen a bit."
2,Had to stitch it myself,Arrived in the package with the stitching already broken. I had to stitch it myself before using it.I use it on weekends and When I want a belt clip instead of a pocket phone.
3,Easy reading - Good overview,Material and subject overview rated 5. Test preparation rated 1. Get Transcender.
1,Extremely poor recording quality,"The sound quality of this CD is abysmal. Imagine placing a box of kleenex on each ear while listening to Chicago in a large arena with poor acoustics. If you can, you've got a good idea of the audio quality on this recording. It's a guaranteed disappointment."
3,For Fans Only,"This album is interesting in that it captures the group after the release of their first album when ""25 or 6 to 4"" is just a new song. Unlike other versions of the 1969 concert in Toronto, this version actually contains a version of ""Beginnings"". ""Introduction"" is often misnamed as ""Beginnings"" on other versions. The band plays with a lot of energy. Unfortunately, the album suffers from poor sound quality - in mono no less. It's still more interesting than Carnegie Hall."
5,Very comfortable in school,"Christmas gift. Item had been recommended by charter school in Blairstown, NJ. 8 year old happy as he loves his new chair."
1,Journeyman Electrician,"Very dissapointed! Don't buy this program if you intend to design a new home. There are many aspects that are sorely lacking, for the price you pay. You cannot draw footings! This is your starting point for a house. You can't draw interior basement walls.....it will kick you into the floor plan section thinking your drawing a interior wall! You can't install plumbing fixtures in the basement! Such as a water heater, shower, or a sink....it kicks you into the floor plan again.This company should be sued under class action. ""Home Design"", I don't think so, If you intend to have a basement your screwed."
1,I just don't get it!,"I have been using AutoCAD for 15 years and I can't believe how difficult Punch [...] 4000 is to use. There seems to be no logic to the way this software works. It seems to be great when you look at the pictures on the box, but it doesn't tell you that most objects and items on the box are custom creations -beds, lighting fixtures, etc. The ones that come in the software are cheesy and unrealistic. If you are adding on to an existing home, custom roof lines or gables are impossible and the video tutorials are useless. All in all, a waste of money and the time to install it."
1,Not professional quality.,The limitations of the software make it useless to a professional and its complexity make it useless to the average user.
5,Excelent Reference,"These books is simply awesome. I have worked with Access for 7 years now, and have worked with more than 15 books that teach Access. These books are simply the best I have worked with. While they won't teach you the basics of working with Access, they will teach any knowledgeable Access programmer how to take their Access applications to the next level. I would recommend these books to anyone serious about developing professional applications with Microsoft Acess."
5,Everybody Needs To Know,"Learning your Boundaries should be taught starting in grade school. Learning mine has made a major difference in my life. I give this book to people as a gift. Do yourself a favor, learn yours then don't let anybody use you like a doormat anymore."
5,Changed my life and everyone around me,"Boundaries works in every area of your life. Many people focus on changing others through trying to control others which, never works and only makes everyone miserable. Boundaries teaches you to control only your own life, what you're will to accept or not accept and in turn it makes everyone around you responsible for their own life. Your kids will have a higher self esteem, they will become more responsible, they will be happier, and your relationships will be better than ever with everyone you choose to keep in your life, whether it be an out of control child, a judgemental parent or spouse, a controlling person in your life. The list goes on.P.S. Overly controlling men do not want their spouse or girlfriend to get a hold of this book. It would do them a lot of good to read the book but highly unlikely. If you want to weed out a control freak just have this book lying around and wait for the negative comments to start coming out."
5,Solid practical advice for ethics in action,"Christians often suffer from the misguided idea that they have to say ""yes"" to everything virtuous, and to everyone. This book offers solid, workable advice on how to live your values without being a doormat. The book includes exercises and insights to put these ideas into action in your own life."
1,Boundaries: When to say yes and how to say no,"The premise of this book was a good one and that is why I downloaded it but it seemed as I read it I felt as if I were in a constant and never ending church sermon. I am a person of very strong faith and really was turned off by the constant references to the Bible. If I wanted to read a collection of sermons I would reread my Bible and not have some one do it for me.The book should be listed under a catagory of religious books and not one to help you discover and control your boundaries. After about 100 pages, I stopped reading and removed the book from my device because I was feeling so annoyed with the sermonizing and lack of any really in depth study of the title subject Boundaries. If I had know that this book could have been returned I would have done that in a heartbeat but was not aware of the return policy until it was too late."
4,Needed guidance for boundary setting.,I found this book helpful. Sometimes we need to set boundaries and can use insight into our thoughts and feelings.
3,At half way mark,"Unless the second half of this book is better than the first, I would not recommend it for those who have already identified their boundary problems. I have heard the author speak at a conference and was pleased with the recommendations he made. So, I tried to start at the beginning, one of his first books. Poor decision on my part so far, because the first half of the book identified lack of boundaries and laid the groundwork for the importance of boundary setting."
5,great book,for any militray person that has PTSD or mental illness you need to learn how to set boundaries and hwo to accept thme same time good study full of usefull info
5,Very Helpful Book,"This books has loads of great insight for improving your personal boundaries. If you feel like you can never say no to others, this is the book for you. It is good for Christians and non-Christians because the insight works no matter what. I am still working on the ideas in this book, but will definately take another read of it in the near future."
1,I'm not impressed,"This book is not a good read my friend is leaving her husband because of it instead of fixing the problems in there relationship which honestly are very few she has set up ""boundaries"" from the relationship and has decided to get a lawyer instead. I hate this book!!!"
5,Boundaries,This book is wonderful. I listen to it in the car and it delivers me every time. I thank God for this book. It is taking the blinders of the area that I didn't know were there.
1,"How to say ""No"" and still be a good Christian?",Biblical quotes and elementary school writing did not meet my adult expectations for discussing boundaries.
2,Good lessons,"This is not the first book about this subject that I've tackled. The concept is good, and timely for our culture and our lack of boundaries. Too many references to the Bible for my taste."
5,Had I read this book 5 years ago. I would not have found myself accepting certain situations into my life.,"This book was very helpful for me because I have a hard time saying no. The consequences are not always good when you say yes when you really mean no. After reading this book, I will never say yes to anything again unless it is something that I really want to say yes to. This book has helped me to set boundaries in my life. We only live once and we were not put here to be manipulated by others.Never let guilt be your guide to saying yes when you really mean no."
1,Misleading description not happy,"I am shocked and annoyed to hear that this book is more about the bs of god and the bible than the real life problem of boundaries.I am so over the religious rubbish, it has nothing to do with the real world. i am a realist and believe that religion does more harm than good.i want my money back, this book should be clearly marked as christian and not self help!!!"
4,Betrayed: Murder in the Bahamas,"It was mildly evident in the writing that this was a first kick at the can for Viper Bob. However, as far as the story is concerned I thought this book was an excellent read. One of the few real page turners I've read in quite a while. I found the story very intriguing, quick paced and kept my interest from the first page to the very last. I wished it had been longer! I look forward in anticipation to Mr. Terwilliger's next shot at story telling."
2,Dont Waste Your Money!,I got this doll for myself. When I stated cuttting her hairI cut it soo short I could'nt cut her hair no more. I took itback to the store. Please do not waste your money!!!
4,Made me think,This is an excellent book for study. A possible update should follow but you can work that out in discussions.
3,Useful information for church leaders,"Thought-provoking, with helpful insights. It is not a manual for churches that want to help the poor; rather it serves as a discussion-starter for those interested."
5,"a fantstic book,a must for any charmed fan","This is a must for any charmed fan not only like the show but with a twist of greek mythology.It starts with Prue gettting the chance to get the photograph cover for 415 the magizine she works for.At the same time Pheobe meets a gorgous guy named Nikos at her art class.But then Prue gets the idea for a photo getting a greek gods/goddesses photo to shoot in the Halliwell mansion,Nikos even got an old camers from his dad to capture the style.But when Prue snaps the shutter all the models apart from Pheobe and Piper fall into a deep sleep.To rescue the models the three sisters go to the Greek Underworld to rescue the models but a surprise awaits them there and the evil gods son has made Pheobe his bride and she may not be able to return to her sisters.Prue and Piper must rescue pheobe and the models but how with only two?Another mystery for tha charmed ones to solve.This is a great book and its not to be missed.I give this 5 stars."
1,The Gatling Gun,This video was of the poorest quality that I could not even enjoy it. Wouldlove to send it back. Don't waste your money like I did.
5,When a parent has cancer:,"This is an excellent guide for being a parent, not just a parent with cancer. You can tell that Dr. Harpham has put enormous energy into making sure her children are affected as little as possible by her illness. Our children would be so lucky if they were not affected by our bad days, our obcessions, or our tainted view of reality. There are a lot of feel good about being a parent books out there. This is an excellent practical guide."
3,English Reading Project,"When I first choose this book in my school library, I wasn't too sure what it was about but the cover looked interesting, so I decided to read it. The book looked like it would be boring because it was pretty old, but it actually turned out to be pretty good. It starts out a little slow in the beginning, a bit boring at times, but about halfway through started to pick up my interest. The story is pretty much a mystery in which a group of teenage kids are trying to solve the disapearence of 102 soldiers in the nearby woods 25 years ago. The kids question their parents and locals. They find out that the truth is quite different from what they were originally told. I won't tell anymore, you'll have to read for yourself. I would recommend this book. It actually has a pretty good story."
5,Powerful Book,I love Stormie and I have several of her other books. I read a passage every day for my son.
4,Almost completely satisfying!,"The gel wrist-pad is very comfortable. The mousepad has a very nice covering to prevent it from getting dirty or greasy easily, BUT the mousepad could have had at least another inch added to it for a little more scrolling space!"
4,Pretty good mouse pad,"I've had this mouse pad for over 6 months now with no real problems with it.the only thing i haven't liked about it is the weird smell it has for the first month are so,i am guessing the glue are something and it's firmer than my old one but i have gotten use to that and still love it."
4,A fine recording,"Keith Jarrett is rightly lauded as one of the finest Jazz improvisers post 1960. That he has recorded Handel, Mozart and Shostakovich in addition to this album of Bach indicates that he has reached a level of musicianship that few will ever equal, let alone surpass.These recordings were performed on a modern Piano. However of course the modern Piano did not exist when Bach wrote the pieces. So Jarretts interpretation has a narrow range of expression, reflecting the fact that originally these pieces were most likely performed on Harpsichord.Off and on I've been listening to these recordings for 15 years now, and as an amateur Pianist myself have found them invaluable when trying to interpret the original sheet music."
2,Seiko 5 Not what I expected form Seiko,"Normally I would have expected much more than I received. Watch is good looking, fit not what I am used to from a Seiko, latch is not the quality I'm used to from Seiko. But the big disappointment is the fact it loses time and won't stay wound for more than a few hours after I take it off. Tried to return, but missed the window. Sorry, but probably the last Seiko I will buy."
1,Revolting,"The ""meat"" has a creamy texture like biting into a stick of brie cheese. Principal ingredient is puréed cow hearts. Each stick has 14% of the USDA daily fat allowance. I wouldn't feed it to my dog."
4,Tastes good and you get lots of them,"I think these are great, but the packaging is so so. It's a bulk pack. They are not individually wrapped. You have to put them in smaller ziploc bags to keep them from going stale."
5,Very Useful,"My initial reason for purchasing was to attach a holster made for a pants belt to a 'vintage' nylon fatty pistol belt. I just so happen to own a large ALICE pack and have subsequently found a million possible uses. If you own ALICE, buy them and find clever ways of putting them to use"
3,"Usable, inexpensive.","I chose this racquet after looking around at sports supply stores where the cheapest racquet was $30. It's worth what I paid for it (12.00 including shipping). It functions, but the rubber and foam on the handle began coming off immediately (little beads of black rubber all over your hands while you're playing) and now the handle has large gaps between the strips of adhesive foam/rubber, which will require re-wrapping. If you don't care too much about the quality of the racquet, this item is a good option, but it won't last long."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"Interesting story idea, but the characters are so poorly sketched out, and the mystery has an unsatisfying ending. Also -- did the author ever go to college? Her characters are shocked that college aged kids would have sex and maybe take a drug or two... she writes like it's a scandalous idea!"
1,Poor quality!,"I had bought this for my kids! When the product arrived it ""looked"" decent until I put it together. Almost every peg was stripped and fell off. Because I am normally not one to complain I just used gorilla glue on it to hold it in place. Then almost every other week I was fixing something else on it. The last week it started tipping over a lot. The bottom leg had a huge crack in it and literally just fell off when I picked it up. I would never buy this product again or recommend it to anyone!!"
1,Awful,"I just received this coat rack today. I was not concerned by the negative reviews about the pegs holding weight b/c I am using it only for my daughter's dress up costumes. However, not only did the pegs not tighten into the pole (of the 8 pegs, only one fit properly) - the pegs actually just fell out of the pre-drilled holes. Some didn't screw in properly and some of them didn't fit at all. I am very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Coat Rack,I tried to report when I received the item that it was defective...the pegs would not stay in the post because it was defectively produced...never got a response and had to move on...it was a bit of a disappointment
1,Not useful,"I bought this for my classroom to hold book bags since I have no storage and only fifteen students. The assembly was easy but the pegs were stripped and did not screw in tightly. As a result, they did not hold even empty book bags and the eventually started to fall out over the course of the day. I took it home that day and sent it back. I am still looking for something sturdy and relatively inexpensive."
4,Invaluable Pointers for Potential Eloquence in Wordsmithing,"I am always looking for books dealing with words and how to better use them. A recent trip to our local library paid big dividends. I discovered Carpenter's book ""Choosing Powerful Words."" Although the book was first published in 1998, the pages are filled with ""The Essence of Public Speaking"" the title of the series highly recommended by Toastmaster's International. Relevant for today's writer/speaker.The ""finale"" information in the appendix on ""delivery"" is all important and provides the key to eloquence in wordsmithing. Carpenter captures the basic principles of mastering rhetoric, antithesis, and metaphor.""Choosing Powerful Words"" whetted my appetite for the rest of the books in this series."
2,just o.k.,I own several ballet videos. I have taken ballet for many years and use videos when there are no classes available. This would be the last one I would grab. It's doable but the explanations are poor and the video is frustrating to watch. The camera person zooms in too much and makes it hard to follow along. The sequences are poorly put together. I much prefer David Howard or Dimitri R. ballet videos. They are wonderful if you know ballet. I hope I will find more challenging tapes out there.
2,bad quality recording,"The workout itself is fine, pleasantly structured like a class yet doable at home without a barre. However, the recording is terrible--80's style and grainy, off colors, horrid sound with twangy, strung-out notes much like an old turn of the last century silent film. MUCH better are NYC Ballet workouts 1 and 2: Stunning visually, high quality, great workout."
4,great work-out video,"This is a great work-out video. But, if you are new to ballet, I found it difficult to learn the moves using correct posture."
4,Great for adult ballet beginners,"I bought this dvd as I have just started an adult beginners ballet class, and wanted a little extra practice at home. For these reasons, this dvd is perfect. It is just like a real class, only you can rewind and watch something again if you didn't quite get it the first time!If you are looking for a standard 'workout' video, then this is probably not for you (although ballet is a good workout) but if you are basically looking for a ballet class in your loungeroom, this is it.It is old-fashioned looking, but the basics of ballet are the same, no matter what year it is, so it still serves the purpose.Exactly what I was looking for."
3,NOT THE BEST,"This book, while very scholarly, is some dull reading. The photos present are not what you'd find in a DK book or other coffee table volume. It's OK to own, but I would not refer to it very often for information or knowledge. There are other books with better presentation."
2,not convincing,"Although this book focuses on the alleged history of man from 35,000 B.C. to around 500 A.D., it states that prehistoric men were using tools TWO MILLION years ago. But it provides no evidence to support such an outlandish claim. Sure, there are lots of crude drawings of buffalos in this book, and some pictures of bones and things that I guess are shaped like tools. But there is nothing convincing. It almost seems like the author is making things up as she goes along.Anybody can go out and find some crude drawings of buffalos on a cave wall. It doesn't prove that there were people living on The Earth two million years ago. I've made crude drawings of buffalos (and arrows) on rocks in the mountains many times throughout my life.In a few years, will scientists say that my drawings prove that prehistoric men used bows and arrows to hunt buffalo?"
5,I Love This Book...,"""Something for Joey"" explains the love between two brothers and how even if you have a sickness like Joey did you have to go on with your life and live each day to the fulliest. This really was a 5 star book and I recommend it to anyone who loves a true story and the bond between two brothers and a family and everyones courage to help out."
4,Two mysteries in one!,"This is book #5 in the cozy mystery series of Hannah Swensen, owner of The Cookie Jar coffeeshop in a small town in Minnesota. Hannah is a busy woman in this book! In addition to running her cookie/coffee shop, she is teaching an evening baking class at the community center. The class is baking all the recipes for the cookies, cakes, pies, and other desserts to be included in a soon to be released town cookbook. Unfortunately, Hannah's propensity for finding dead bodies continues when she finds the Sherriff Grant's body in the dumpster behind her classroom. Her brother-in-law, who was running for sherriff against Sherriff Grant, is a prime suspect. So Hannah sets out to find the killer. The second mystery she needs to solve before the cookbook goes to press is what is the secret ingredient in Ted's late mother's fudge cupcakes."
2,Hannah? PICK A DUDE.,"Or just come right out and tell them you're poly, and let the cards fall where they may. So there's good news and bad news about this book. The good news is that even though you can tell whodunnit on page 150, this is a decent book, and the author's found a couple of great ways to perk up the series: developing Andrea as a likeable character, giving the mom a beau to make her seem more human and less demonic (Laura Childs take note for possibilities for Delaine), and giving Michelle intriguing deviousness. The bad news is that there are 100 pages in the middle I just didn't care about, and I cannot believe the protagonist runs her own successful business, bakeshop or no, because in 300 pages, she spent so little time there that I'm amazed no one's stealing from the till or smashing the windows. But overall a solid entry"
3,Fudge Cupcake Murder,"I really love Joanne Fluke's ""Hannah Swensen"" murder mysteries. This one was more predictable than some have been in the past, but I will continue to read her books. They are light reads, and just fun and quick."
3,Not so great!,To put it simply - I made a few of the suggested meals and they were far from delicious.
4,A marked transition from her earlier work,"I loved Magdalen Hsu-Li's previous work and this is no exception, but it is very different than her previous albums. I think this is a reflection of her getting older and becoming seemingly more at peace with everything. It's not as angry, as accusing. It's a very peaceful album, if that makes sense. The two tracks that I love and can listen to over and over are ""Mary Magdalen"" and ""No Ordinary Girl"". I recommend it to Magdalen fans. If ever I get the chance to see her in concert again (she performed at my alma mater a few years ago), I'll definitely take it."
5,I LOVE this bag!,"I bought this bag for my husband so he wouldn't have to carry a bag that wasn't masculine. I actually use it every day! I love it, it looks great and it fits everything I need on a daily basis. It's comfortable to carry and looks great too! We have been using it for a year now and have hardly ever had to use another bag (accept his toy bag of course)."
5,Good Resonance,"I bought this to put on risers & travel with a 12"" Tumba & 10"" Quinta. These drums, have good heads, are comfortable to play, stay tuned & travel well. I have played two gigs with the 3 of them thus far. Recommend bags & a hand trolly."
5,60s Nostalgia,"The memories start turning with the first song and continue through the entire CD. I wouldn't want to go back to being 20 and in college, but I enjoyed remembering where I was/what I was doing as I listened to these all-time hits of the sixties. Yarbrough has such a melodic and entreating voice."
2,"Only for hardcore DM fans, and even then...",People are People is a better choice than this one. It has the good songs from it and doesn't include the bad. The Landscape is Changing is beyond overripe. More Than A Party is... um...
4,Great ideas,"Hey! Just xerox the design page of the banner of your choice and get out the colored pencils. Color in the drawing and you have a good jumping off point to take to the fabric store. Pin swatches to the sheet for an easy reference. I have used several of the designs in the sanctuary and have received no complaints. Simple way to get started and has loads of info inside.I would also recommend How to design and make banners for sacred and secular festivals by Banbury and Dewar (some color pics) AND Fabric applique for worship by Jerdee (NO color pics except cover & includes stoles and chausables). Both of these are for the more advanced, creative designers and seamstresses out there."
5,Banners for Worship,"I was hesitant to order this book as it was an older book. After receiving along with another newly published church banner book, there was no comparison. This book is wonderful. It covers every church holiday and gives several design patterns to pick from each category. There are no colored pics inside, but each pattern is color coded to help in the color process. If you have a pattern sizer on your computer, no need to worry about the task of enlarging by copier. There are so many choices, that I know I will be making more than the banner planned for my son's wedding. I am an experienced quilter and with so many choices of fabric to choose from today, no need to bother with felt. I am glad that I purchased this book!"
5,Great Ideas,"Super book. I've used several patterns for church banners already and have my eye on several more. It,s a great addition to my library."
2,Not as Nice as Image,"The image really looks much better than the actual product. Stones are quite brownish, not red as one would expect of garnet. I wouldn't recommend anyone purchase this."
4,Celtic Knot Earrings,"I love earrings and I always try to find interesting patterns. Well, I came across these lovely Celtic Knot earrings. These earrings are a little smaller and more light weight then most of my other pairs, which allows me to ware these earrings for a couple of days without them bothering me. I am really pleased with this pair."
4,"Very pretty, good-sized earings","I bought these for myself while buying some other jewelry from Silver Insanity for gifts. These are quite nice, but once I saw theSterling Silver Teardrop Red GARNET Marcasite Earringsthat I bought for someone else, I wish I had bought myself a pair of those instead of these! Still these are nice. Yes, the garnet has a brown tone, but the only thing I'd fault on these earrings is that the bezel holding the garnet is kind of thick, and I think it would look better if the front edge of the bezel was attached to the rest of the silver knot work, instead of attached at the back of the bezel, to reduce some of the ""thick"" look of the bezel. Still, for about $15, that's a minor quibble."
5,Beautiful workmanship,"This is the second item I have ordered from this company, and I am extremely pleased with the quality and value for my money. I would recommend them to anyone."
3,"Decent paper, but not great","I was really hoping for some fantastic matte textured heavy stock paper, but what I got was little more than light cardstock. My suggestion, if you want a good textured/matte paper, go buy some resume paper, otherwise go for the Luster if you really want the WOW factor!"
5,jeet kune do,"ITS DAN INOSANTO BRUCE LEE,S BEST FRIEND . THE SAME AS BRUCE LEE. THE GREATEST MASTERS IN THE WORLD. JEET KUNE DO.FOUNED BY BRUCE LEE AND PASSED DOWN BY THE TEACHER AND MASTER AND NOW SR GRAND MASTER JKD FATHERS BRUCE LEE AND DAN INOSANTO .I GUESS YOU MEANT THE BOOK ITS GREAT.NEVER REAN IT . DID NOT HAVE TO.BEEN A STUDENT OF BRUCE LEE AND DAN INOSANTO SINCE 1966.THANK YOU."
1,Be careful with hardwood cabinets,"My cabinets are wood - maybe harder than pine - but still wood. The screws provided in the kit to install the latches actually couldn't handle the torsional stress needed to put them into the wood. I now have two bits imbedded into the inside of my rather expensive kitchen cabinets. Hidden - yes - however... how hard is it to provide real screws. On the plus side, I can now open my cabinet door with a strong magnet. Avoid this product... and it you have it already... go down to the store with the screws and pay the money for real hardware."
1,Very Poor Design,Pros:None except: function of first installed latch was so poor it was obvious they could not be used. This saved me the trouble of having to install / uninstall more than one latch.Cons:1) almost impossible to align; tip of latch changes locations as you tighten screws because soft plastic distorts. If tightened prior to plastic distortion then latch is loose / unsecured.2) latch is too short. My hands or medium sized and I cannot fit my fingers in between door and frame. I needed a tool to press down on latch.3) screws too short. They were sufficient length to install latch but not for catch. Catch had to installed upside down.
5,Great resource for learning mixed mode simulation,"If you want to learn how to use SPICE to simulate mixed mode systems then this book is a great resource. The author does not provide step by step instructions. Instead the author provides a large set of examples to learn from. The examples mainly cover topics like switched capacitor analog filters, digital filters, analog to digital converters and digital to analog converters. You can use either Cadence IC51, Cadence IC61 or LTspice versions of SPICE as examples are provided for all three versions."
5,Great Book,Bought this for some ADC information. Found it very useful.Baker has a great way of explaining things.I would like to see a little more on Incremental ADCs
4,"Very High, but great for fetish wear","They are great shoes. The only reason they get a 4 is because they are so high that it makes your toes slide a little past the front of shoe. Not a lot, but enough. They also are very tight around the ankles. Other then that very sexy shoe throw on a Black corset and some fish nets and woo la la"
5,"""Someday"" is even better than ""Every Morning""","Sugar Ray has hit us with another hit: ""Someday"". I lovethis song because it is so relaxing. It just soothes me when it comes on theradio...or on tv.The video is awesome. I would rate it higher than "" Every Morning"" because it is more simplistic, yet very artistic and different from a lot of the things you see out today.""Someday"" is a great song. If you're a fan of Sugar Ray, then you'll love it!!!"
4,Gullah Folktales Represented,"The history of this book is interesting. Charles Colcock Jones compiled these folktales during the late 19th century. He developed much of his compilation based on the memory of stories that he heard as a youth growing up in the Deep South. He had a good ear for the Gullah creole, but the book shouldn't been seen as a completely accurate rendition of the language. The book is now reissued with an excellent introduction to Gullah culture and Jones' original compilation work. The stories, themselves, are really interesting, entertaining, and poignant to read. With a careful reading, the reader develops a greater familiarity with Gullah, and the stories becomes a resource for appreciating the beauty of Gullah. In this way, the stories and the Gullah speech interanimate each other."
3,Written for and by the educated,"This book is written by a judge and it reads like it is. In this book and subject matter, it works. This is a story based on myth and legend instead of fact.Zobel gives the facts the way only a judge could give.Its educational and solid read.It is a great pre- Mccullough John Adams book to read.It's a holy trinity for me.Zobel-McCullough-Ellis - The Adams Trilogy."
1,the record comany made me do it...part 1,"when bands brake up, or there is a major line-up change, or creativity is exhausted, and the record company has you under contract, this is usually the type of material that gets put out. the music on Ultra, though extremely polished, sounds like digital run of the mill alternative music, with the exception of David Gahan's voice, and Martin Gore's lyrics. If you're a Depeche Mode fan, then this is your album, but if you're into Depeche Mode's more dance/industrial sound(Violator, Some Great Reward), stay completely away. But if you're the traditional DM fan, and like the music for the lyrical content, then this is perfection. Maybe Martin Gore should just stay away music, and just write poetry, and that's a real complement, he seems to have the ability to get his emotions to paper quite well."
5,They Just Keep Getting Better,"For those looking for another ""Violator,"" or ""Black Celebration,"" forgetaboutit! Depeche Mode have made a great effort to produce a different sound each time out since 1986. And I think each CD has been a bit better than the last. ALthough reduced to a trio, DM is more mature, more balanced, and well on its way to becoming the first synth-pop band to be nominated into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. You heard it here first..."
5,"brilliant, excellent, stunning, modern","I encourage anyone who enjoys 101 and Violator to taste newer Depeche Mode. lyrics, rhythms, nothing disappoints."
4,Very Good 5.1 Mix,"Enjoyed it. Added it to my collection of SACD's and DVD Audio. Pick it up, it is cheap and worth the price."
1,Nice toy but not so nice ants,This toys would be excellent if it didn't come with RED Fire ants that Can STING your children. The box does not say that nor does the order form for the ants but when you get them in the mail you can see that they are RED ants and the package says WARNING!!! ANTS CAN STING!!!!
2,Not the best,"I gave it two stars because it brought my mom's dinosaur phone back to a usable state.I did not give it any more stars than that because it should hold a charge for close to a week, and it's only holding a charge for 3/4ths of a day."
5,HISTORICO!!!!,"Although the quality of the sound is not at least to regulate, we must appreciate the historic value of these recordings... are beatles playing at the Star Club in Hamburg. The only thing that had lacked is to include all the songs of the Star Club. ""Reminicing"" and ""Till There was You"", also the incomplete ""Road Runner"" and the complete versions of ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and ""A Taste Of Honey""... but it is the CD that brings you more songs that any other disc... 5 stars.Si Bien la calidad del sonido no es siquiera regular, debemos apreciar el valor historico de estas grabaciones... son los beatles tocando en el Star Club. Lo unico que hubiese faltado para que sea excelente es incluir todas las canciones del Star Club.. Faltan ""Reminicing"" y ""Till There was You"" por no decir tambien ""Road Runner"" y las versiones completas de ""I Saw Her Standing There"" y ""A Taste Of Honey""... pero es el cd que trae mas canciones que cualquier otro disco... 5 estrellas."
2,Don't be fooled,Despite its respectable cover this is only slightly more serious than the celebrity tell-alls of recent months. Incidentally it also has at least a couple of factual flaws even mild Internet research could have corrected
5,The Same Smile,"I loved this book. Although it is difficult to understand in this day, the stigma attached to being single in pregnant in the 50's and 60's was devastating. This book addresses what happened to all those girls who went to their ""aunts"" for the summer. Eventually reuniting with her daughter, Susan's live wasn't without more sadness. Expecting this to be a particularly sad book with the loss of not one, but two daughters, instead it was a book of triumph and celebrations of the human spirit."
2,"OOPS -- **NOT** ""really"" the ""PICTORIAL SUPPLEMENT""","I ordered this book thinking it was the ""pictorial supplement"" to Melody's challenging (read: ""pictureless"") five-star original sensitive-gal **Love is in the Earth** encyclopedic guide. This is a thin book of leftovers on glossy paper with one small and really lame picture on each two page spread. NOT WHAT I HAD IN MIND. In truth I wanted the much larger, similarly named: **Love Is in the Earth - Mineralogical Pictorial : Treasures of the Earth.** Gee -- is it me? That's minus one for stupid title breeding, -1 for using a scanner to take pictures of the rocks, and -1 for for not coming out with a new edition of **Love Is in the Earth: A Kaleidoscope of Crystals,** instead."
5,Summer Storm,"There is so much I love about this movie. A simple story that borderlines on almost being cliche, but the writer saves it in a variety of ways in the dialogue. I was impressed with all the actors, but Alicia Bachleda-Curus, and Marlon Kittel certainly stand out in this movie for me. Both, in my opinion, are fine actors who need to be recognized more internationally. (ok I'm talking about the America market here.)Now the music. The music by Nada Surf and Vast was used so affectively. There is a beautiful scene were the hauting music of Vast is played while the camara scans the aftermath of the storm. Also listen to the last song during the credits by a group called Rosenstolz. Unfortunately there is no soundtract for this movie so I had to go out and buy each cd separately. (all were good)"
5,M-azing,"I dont remember how in the world i heard about this movie, but it is just amazing. I absolutely love this movie and highly reccommend it."
3,flying filters,"The fan is great, the used filters are dirty so its doing something.BUTPredictably, the filters fly out when we turn the fan on; not right a way mind you but at 2am on a hot summer night, one at a time, the filters fly out .We have resolved this issue effectively with rubber bands (the kind women use for their hair) to hold the filters in place."
2,They are what they are. Overpriced foam.,"These wedge are ok - typical foam, nothing more dense or detailed as you might expect with $100 foam. These are glorified egg crate foam pieces cut. That's all. I imagine production cost for these is around $10. And they charge $100. You do the math."
4,Very imformative - Makes sense,"This book really made sense. It promotes a natural lifestyle, eliminating chemicals from your life as much as possible. The positive thinking aspect also makes sense. This is a must read for everyone in this day and age of chemical overload, polution, genetically modified foods, etc. It really gave me a lot to think about and definitely changed my opinion on cancer! Some of the spiritual stuff was a little out there, but if you can get past that, the other information was really helpful."
1,Nonsense on stilts,"You must be joking. Cancer is all in the mindset of its victims? And a 40-year-old quote from a forgotten researcher (Dr. Hardin Jones) says what, exactly, about current cancer treatments?The author of this book doesn't know what he's talking about: he's not a doctor, a medical researcher, or even a low-level health professional, he's a ""medical intuitive"", whatever the hell that means. What to learn more? Just Google ""Andreas Moritz"" and read on."
5,One of the most valuable books I have ever read,"This book changed my entire view of sickness and disease. Things that I once found overwhelming, chaotic and frightening, no longer have any hold over me. I can now even embrace a simple cold, knowing that it has the capacity to restore balance to my body. Ironically, I now use sickness to my benefit, using it to help me find more and better ways to be healthy. This is a fantastic book, telling you that yes, you're body does know what it's doing, so step aside and let it do its job!"
5,The Lost Episodes - Rejection (Vol. 2),"Goku seems to have taken to his new, smaller body without a hitch. But trouble soon arises on the merchant planet, Imecka. The residents of this strange world are being persecuted by their tyrannical despot, Lord Don Kee. Goku, Trunks, and Pan vow to lift Don Kee's oppressive grip on the Imeckians, but soon find out how far the Don will go to stay in power. The action heats up as Don Kee sends his number one mercenary to quell the rebellion!"
2,"Ok, but the cutter broke the first time I used it.","The crimper works fine, but the cutter broke the first time I used it. I contacted the seller about a replacement, and never got a response."
4,AAA+++,"Everything was great!, no damage to the case or booklet and the disk was a little smudged but that was about it."
2,mom of toddler,"I purchased this toy for the ball park option, the amount of balls provided is inadequate for playtime. After phone calls back to the store and extensive on-line searches I cannot purchase extra balls. The ratings would go up if enough balls were included."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased 2 of this cartridge, the first was very good, the 2nd did not print at all, I tried to reinstall it few times but the fax/printer did not recognized it as installed and it could not print. I had this fax/printer for 7 years and used many cartridges from various sources. I never had such a problem. After installing a cartridge from another source the fax/printer works fine. So my experience is 50% not good."
2,Pictures with flash are blurry,"I own this camera for 2 years, and I am fed up with losing picture opportunities - inside pictures are all blurry, and if person moves-the blurr is awful. Outside pictures are good, but I am going to buy Canon this time. It is probably the speed, that messes things up."
4,A simple investment plan that should beat most mutual funds.,"Bill Staton has a very simple investment plan. Buy stock in companies that have a great long term record(he provides a list of over 400) and hold them as long as they continue to perform. Not very exciting or complex, but it should work great. With deep discount brokers not offering trades for as little as $8, I think he should spend more time pointing out the advantage of using them over using DRIP plans. I would think that his investment plan would be better than the way that over 90% of investors now invest. His book is very easy to read."
3,5 years is too long,"I double my money at least once every 6 months. If you are serious at all about making money in the stock market, then you're talking about selling options, not investing in the traditional way.This book is good, that is if you want to double your money every 5 years. It is not powerful enough."
5,Loved it!,"I just re read this book. Loved it the first time when it first came out and loved it again. It is different from Howard's other books, but I found it light, fluffy, and entertaining. Sometimes you just want to enjoy a book and be entertained. I read a lot of mystery suspense and murder mysteries and romances. This was just a fun book."
1,Hated the first person outlook,"I really do like Linda Howard, but this book was not even good enough to finish. For one thing the first person point of view was terrible, and I found myself not even liking the main character, she REALLY got on my nerves! I mean, how can you read a book when you do not even like the main character?!? Sorry Ms. Howard, I have really liked your others, but I think next time I will have to check the ratings before I trust another of your books by sight alone."
1,Disappointing,I didn't like the first person point of view that she uses in this one. The story was kind of lacking and the steamy sex that is characteristic of Linda Howard is missing . I have been a long time fan and this will be the first of her books that I will donate to charity.
2,"Love Howard's writing, hate the heroine","I'm not sure how Linda Howard managed to write two books featuring this character - Blair Mallory. I've read half the book looking for some redeeming quality within Blair's vapid mind, and I finally give up. This is not to say that Howard isn't great. If you want to read some of her quality stuff, please read ""Cry No More"" and ""All the Queen's Men."" Loved those books, and loved the people in them."
5,"LH Not Only writes HOT, she writes HILARLIOUS as well!!!!!","I've been a hugh LH fan for years since the 80s, but I've only enjoyed her hot dramas. She writes them hot as well as emotional (check out SARA'S CHILD, you'll cry your heart out). However, this is the first experience I've ever had of LH writing romantic comedy and boy was it soooooooo darn good. I could not get over how smartass funny she made the heroine and hunky and cute the hero was. I'm not going to bog you all down with details on the book, because you all are mostly LH fans and you know how good & hot she writes. However, I must say that this is such a treat for me to discover another side the the brilliant Linda Howard, she never ceases to amaze me with her versatile talent. I highly, highly, highly recommend this book. And btw, don't let the First person writing deter you from reading or enjoying the story. I'm not so keen on First Person writing either, but in this case, LH again does it brilliantly. Big Big KUDOS for this book!"
1,Pathetic,"This book was a waste of my time, the author's time and anyone else involved in getting this book into print. Linda Howard has written some wonderful novels, so I kept reading, hoping things would improve. It's pretty sad when you start hoping the heroine DOES get killed. I liked the other characters, and liked the town, it was just the nitwit that I could have done without. If the point was to show that even a self-involved impressed-with-herself Southern princess deserves happiness, then the objective failed."
4,Fun Read,"This would make a great romantic comedy. Even the motive behind the murder attempts was funny. If you're a fan of Ms Howard's brand of humor, this book is definitely worth it.Ms Howard is a very versatile writer. She can make you laugh, cry or suspend your disbelief...expect the unexpected. In this instance, I got the feeling that neither the female protagonist nor the book took themselves too seriously and it was a refreshing change."
5,Very enjoyable book - highly recommended,"I am usually turned off with first person narratives, but decided to give this one a try. This is a thoroughly entertaining and fun story! Wish I had it to read all over again. I'm recommending it to all my friends and co-workers as one not to be missed. You'll enjoy it too!"
2,Not at all what I expected....,"I love Linda Howard's books. I frequently read them repeatedly. There are only two now three, that I will not reread. When you read a James Patterson Book, you know what your getting, a first person narrative, but even he allows the other person's thought processes to be known. I found this book completely one sided (obviously after the first chapter). Granted, you have a little foresight into Mr. Bloodsworth's actions but it is superficial. I would have found the story more intriguing if she (Howard) wrote at her best. Filling all the pertinent characters with life, and charisma. The book, yes, had it's funny parts but, I found myself speeding through the thoughts sections of Blair, they were tedisious and repetitive."
3,Not what I'd expected,I was quite dissappointed with this book. Maybe it's because I had read almost all of Linda's books and had set a high expectation for this one. The story line wasn't that bad but it just didn't pull me in as Linda's previous books like 'Dream Man' or 'kill and tell'. It could be that I was bias since I don't like book written in first person. I think Linda is better at writing in 3rd person. Anyway read the book and decide for yourself :) There's quite a bit of humor in this novel :D
4,Book is very informative,"I found this book to be a very good book that clearly explains what a schmidt-cassegrain telescope can do for you. So if you are not sure that a schmidt-cassegrain is for you, before you spend a hefty sum for a good scope check out this book, its well worth it Thank You Geoff Nash"
1,Ad says 3 you get 1!,"This ad is MISLEADING! You will recieve 1 window lock NOT 3. I contacted the vender and was told I could return it at MY expense. You can buy this for $5 at any big box retailer. this ad is VERY MISLEADING! How can 1 lock be ""Keyed alike""?"
2,Not for an average size adult female,"I bought this bracelet with the intention of giving it to my 23 year old daughter. When I received it, I felt it was more for a young teenager. It is small for the average woman's wrist. The quality was disappointing.I thought it would be a more classic bracelet. Too young on an adults wrist"
2,Please don't bend the notes!,"On first time of hearing I thought 'how innovative', but after a few plays something began to grate. The sax improvisation, I think, works, but it's the style of playing that doesn't. Bending the notes, for me, isn't appropriate for this genre. It's a shame, but there you are."
5,What I needed,The package came wrapped in cardboard with about 3 of each shim stamped with the size and came in two boxes.
3,Pleasant Indy Pop,"Witty lyrics, snazzy but simple instrumentals, and a sugary pop feel are what you get from this CD. There are some pretty fantastic moments throughout, but I think the first song, Monitor, pretty much takes the cake. It has more emotional content than much of the rest of the album. If you like Indy Pop music in the vein of the Magnetic Fields, I'd recommend this CD (though I'd also warn you that the Magnetic Fields are the better band)."
4,Beautiful Stirrups,"These stirrups caught my eye because they appeared to be properly positioned for maximum foot comfort and ride-ability. They came promptly and looked great. They fit great and they were a handsome addition to my saddle. Perhaps it's my riding style but the same thing that appealed to me ended up being what I didn't like. There is a brass loop attaching the stirrup to the leathers and turning the stirrup to the proper position; that same loop pushes, and/or bangs, into my lower shin just above my foot, when I ride. Because I was getting pretty bruised and could not figure out how to stop it from happening, I stopped using the stirrups."
2,simple minded and superficial,This book is poorly written and superficially researched with almost no basis in reality and overhyped and overjuiced. I want my money back!
4,One of the better Amanda Pepper mysteries...,"Very solid mystery. While this book is a step below other Amanda Pepper books such as, ""With Friends Like These"", ""The Bluest Blood"", or ""Caught Dead in Philadelphia"", it is miles above ""How I Spent My Summer Vacation"" and ""I'd Rather Be in Philadelphia""."
5,Infinite Repeat,"The best Erasure CD since Cowboy. I have enjoyed each and every Erasure album for the past twenty-plus years. For some reason I really got caught up in Cowboy due to the wonderful lyrics and the good feeling I got when listenting to it. Nightbird is giving me the same musical high. Andy's voice has barely changed and the music will always put a smile on your face. Thank god for enjoyable music that adults can enjoy! It always amazes me that they haven't had a pop hit in years. It just amazes me that people have such horrible taste in music and so many incredible bands get very little credit and are soon assumed to be deceased. Well, Erasure has been alive for a long, long, time. Whew!"
5,Love this CD!!!,I took me over a year to love this CD. It was worth the wait. This is a excellent CD. Amazing!
2,lol lol,I read this book and to tell you the truth it was boring. Well for me! No offence people who like it. I've read all the other charmed books and I think there were better books than this one! I think the author needs to get to the point faster. Well I don't now but that's just me! ...
3,Middle of the Road.,"I like the reviews written pro and con on here. If you're looking at this book, the question is, obviously to buy or not to buy. This book touches on a rather important subject in our world's history. Who hasn't been affected in some way to the Holocaust? Whether reading a book as this or seeing a movie, visiting the sites, etc.The author does say it is a legend. The book even explains what a legend is. Would I buy this book again? Probably not. There's just too much to explain in such a short time. But I would recommend it from a library.I'm middle of the road on this one."
1,Piece of Crap,Too complicated to even use the first time. Not user friendly at all. Do not waste your time or money.
3,reasonable,The set arrived fast. the chairs were already assembled but the quality of them is not the best. Two chairs were not glued correctly and we had to fix them. Small dents and scratches were on different parts of the set(table legs and chairs)The furniture is reasonable for that price.
3,"Hammer Film Noir Colelctor's Set, Vol 2","These mostly all okay, and some interesting stories. However, Glass Tomb not very great, but I really didn't expect that. Trumpet in Black Glove SUPER IMPRESSIVE. Unholy Four one of best, and A Race for Life w/Richard Conte not so great. However, for the money, is okay to interest one when TV has nothing of interest. All 4 discs (8 movies) okay except Deadly Game has two small places where hum is detected, but not enough to ruin the movie.Cecy IvieCecy Ivie"
2,"NOT a ""new"" album..","This cd is a collection of demos from their early days, when they were more of a punk band...not new material."
5,Great Time Saver,No need to take caddy into the house anymore.I just plug it into my car 12v and grab it at the course.
3,RESIDENT EVIL LOVER...,"THIS GAME IS GREAT, BUT ONLY BUY IT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PS1 OR PS2 BECAUSE THE GRAPHICS ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE PS1 GAME, AND DO NOT DO THE GAMECUBE JUSTICE...GREAT GAME THOUGH!"
3,"Same graphics, BUT scary!","We all know now the RE is almost the top selling game on the GCN, Zero is above it, but the downfall of 2 isn't. Yet again, another waist of waiting, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis came out. Same Graphics, but more zombies. Cheap looking gore, but scary scenery. Nemesis is the only new improved thing in the game. Now instead of big blob of polygons, it is a well done creature. The addition of female, male, fat and skinny zombies makes you feel like, ""Hey, that looks like my girl friend. DIE!"". That is cool and makes the game scary. The fire and smashed cars and the cramped city is just plainly scary. Still, it would've done better if CapCom wasn't so lazy! But I would recomend buying this one for the GameCube. Scare you later!"
4,Not A REMAKE!,"RE 2 and 3 are no remakes, just reformated games to be put on the Gamecube. The only remake was the first RE and thats it and everything else is the same as the Playstion versions. Dont waist your money on buying a game you can just get for the PS witha cheaper price. Who ever said that this and RE3 has better graphics is wrong. They've been talking way to much about nothingm, they are just assuming things that become big lies."
5,Polk big boom!,"This sub has a huge boom wow factor. I had a klipsch 10 inch sub and prior to that a DCM 10 inch and I must say this 12 inch Polk freakin blows them away. The dcm was good for under $300 , the klipsch was about $550 and this sub is worth every penny of $750 but when I checked amazon I couldn't believe what the price was. No need to look further, if you like home theater or just like music this sub can really kick butt. I like a good deal but I want the product to work well also and I must say this works very well. 10/10 stars"
2,We didn't use it,The size says 0-6 months but it's HUGE! I intended to have my 2 month old wear it for her first Halloween and it was far too large. At the rate my LO is growing I don't think she'd be big enough for it by 6 months and I've never met a baby that would fit this costume at that age either.
1,"A real ""nose-picker"" of a book!","I was shocked that Froggy screams back, ""WHAAAAAAAAT"" so rudely whenever his father yells his name (well, whattya expect when the father is always yelling FROGGGGGY!!!). Not a good example to follow.Also, in this one, Froggy openly picks his nose. Is that supposed to be funny? maybe for a certain crowd, but again, not a good example for young children to follow. Crude at best.I will not be buying any more of these books. Froggy always turning more red than green in every book is also very annoying."
2,unconfortable,"is a product that seems quite sturdy, but it is too wide for a small stroller. OK for a big car, but not a light one."
1,Yeeee...,"It may be just me, but I didn't like this book just because of the focus on the scummiest of human nature. People lying to cover their butts, sinking deeper into despair, drugs messing with people's minds, digging themselves in deeper and deeper...yick. It just creeps me out..."
5,Great Product,"Looked at this product before, but it never came in a big enough sizeMy husband loves the back support, and I can tell his pain level ismuch better. Great support from this belt."
5,Awesome Game,This is an AWESOME game. This is great story telling and it can be replayed again and again. Definitely a classic in my book!
5,A Legend Among Resident Evil Games,"Resident Evil 2 could easily be the one game everyone loves most. The storyline is great with plenty of twist and turns. You will meet a variety of people along your adventure out of Raccoon City, from the Police Chief to a mysterious woman named Ada. You can play as either Claire Redfield or Leon S. Kennedy, and if you beat the game in the right amount of time you can even play as The Fourth Survivor. I highly reccommend this game."
3,Not a review... a rant,This game as well as RE3 for GC are STRAIGHT ports from the older games. The graphics and resolutions have been cleaned up some but there is NO new content like in the RE1 remake. Capcom first announced these games with a price of $.. and now they want people to pay double that for games that have nothing new and are several years old. I love the RE series and really want to have the complete set for GC but I can't justify paying nearly full price for straight ports. My advice is wait till these games come down in price.
5,Must Have,This guy knows more about how to heal the Planet than the rest of Humanity combined. Four More Words - Ridiculous!
3,A little too cynical,"This was an interesting and lively read. For those interested in learning more about the modern italians this is a good start.The only problem I had with the book was that the author seemed to pessimistic and cynical about the italian nation. I have lived in Italy and yes it could be some what insecure, however there are many good aspects of italian life i thought the author overlooked.For example his account on the region of Calabria focused only on organized crime. Yes this is a problem in the south, however I come from a Calabrian family and these people are perhaps the most loyal and hospitable in all Italy."
2,"""multi-state"" is misleading","It's not clear from the Amazon ""ad"" that the multi-state version can only be used for a SINGLE state unless you call and pay an additional $19.95 to get an authorization code for each additional state that you need. I paid more for this package than for the federal version because I thought I would have access to all the states that I needed. Very misleading!! I haven't actually used the software yet, so I can't comment on its features."
4,Bigelow Cinnamon Stick Tea better when sold directly by Amazon,"I love this cinnamon tea and drink it every morning. It is now much more difficult to find locally, so I ordered a case of it once from Amazon and got a great deal. When I went to do it again this time, Amazon no longer carried it, but they brokered it for Bigelow to sell direct. I had to pay more shipping for Bigelow to send it than Amazon and it took much longer to arrive, almost two weeks instead of two or three days from Amazon. I'll still buy it this way because I can't reliably find it in my area, but I'm not as thrilled as I was last time."
1,Presto is wrong wrong wrong wrong!,"Presto is so wrong about this seal fitting a 01/PCC6 6 quart aluminum pressure cooker. It is about 2"" too long and way too thin. I even went to the local hardware store and looked at their presto sealing ring by the same number and it was the same thing, so there was no mis-packaging. Presto is just dead wrong, simple as that. I buy pressure cookers (and other stuff) at thrift stores and yard sales with the idea of making them servicable again and giving them to someone that needs one. I bought the pressure regulator, the air vent and the seal, because of the seal, it's all moot. If you have a 01/PCC6, this ain't the seal you need."
1,Wrong item sent,"The sealing ring sent was not even close to what the correct part was supposed to be. One size does not fit all in presto pressure cookers. Advertised as a 6 quart sealing ring, but definitely does not fit my 6 quart pressure cooker."
3,Not similar enough!,"I'm sure this is a good tool However, I bought it because of the claim of being similar to Ford No. 211-D029 (D93L-3395-A). The only similarity is that it is an inner tie rood removal tool. The adapter does not fit over the inner tie rod at least not on 2002-2005 Ford Explorer. The Ford No. 211-D029 (D93L-3395-A) is apparently no longer available."
4,Fascinating!,"This is a fascinating book about the evolution of volcano science written in language easy enough for the layperson to understand. The author discusses how the eruptions of Mt. St. Helen's, plus several other volcanoes around the world helped develop methods for making more accurate predictions and alert systems. This book is also about the sometimes explosive relationship between volcano scientists, journalists, politicians, and people living near volcanoes. There are so many interesting facts about volcanoes in this book, including the many, many ways in which volcanoes can be an extremely dangerous and deadly force of nature. A must read for anyone living near a volcano."
5,exciting vulcanology lesson for the non-expert,"Who knew volcanos could be so interesting and exciting? This traces the development of vulcanology in the US from the 1980 erruption of Mt. St. Helens through the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Phillipines in 1990s. Fast paced, suspenseful, technical but accessable. Now you can discuss pyroclastic flows with confidence. My only complaint is that the photos were insufficient (too few, quality not great). Still, you can go to USGS websites and download thousands. I rented Dante's Peak while reading the St. Helens section and was surprised to find a lot of the book in the movie. It made a wannabe vulcanologist out of me."
5,Moving and realistic,This is a brave story for Senator McGovern and his family to tell. By writing this book they have taken some of the shame out of alcoholism and told a real account of the devistation alcoholism takes on the alcoholic and everyone that comes in touch with them. I really appreciated their taking the time to write this helpful book.
2,A Dated and Incomplete History,"I have read an original copy of F. Stansbury Hayden's work, and while it was probably the seminal work for its time, circa 1941, it was only one volume of a two volume work that was never completed. Hayden is also not the most organized writer and his style is also not very well in keeping with contemporary standards.I recently read and wrote a review of a recently published book called War of the Aeronauts by Evans. Comparatively, Evans write a complete history of ballooning in the Civil War and writes his book compellingly. I would really recommend that most readers would find War of the Aeronauts a more satisfying and well told story compared to this book."
5,I love this book!,"I absolutely love this book! When I bought the book, I knew only how to cast on and off, knit, and purl. After working through several of the fun patterns and following the very clear instructions, I actually consider myself a ""knitter."" It's a great book for learning to knit, and the patterns are very cute. I highly recommend this book!"
2,Not Too Impressed,"When I saw this book, I thought, oh wow, vintage patterns...no way! This book is more for the person who is learning to knit, not the veteran knitter. The patterns are ho hum...boring. It has what other books have. Nothing impressive. Save your money and your time. If you are a newbie knitter, this is the perfect book for you. Otherwise, forget it."
5,Inspired Projects for Baby,"This book gives lots of inspiration for those looking to knit for baby.The patterns are easy to follow even for the knitting novice. These are considered heirloom projects so most of the yarn called for requires wool or cashmere because of there durabilty. You can easily substitute lower quality yarn if you desire, use your imagination.The toys and diaper bag patterns are a nice addition to the book. I have made several of the bears for friends so far and they love them!"
5,a rock'n album,"the piano, although not odd, but uncommon in todays music plays beautifully with the guitars, bass and drums. seth timbs voice echos a richness into the already brilliant lyrics. this album is wonderful."
3,Ok gun but seller is bad,This gun is pretty good and it has ok fps. It is all plastic but good quality plastic. Customer service is awful and would be impossible to return gun. The gun is also overpriced and shipping is expensive. I would recommend going to airsoftmegastore.com. They have the best prices and free shipping for orders over $99. So you could get a $110 gun and be paying the same price as you would for this gun. This gun is also very annoying because the battery is jammed in the front and leads to breaking of wire. Well also does not make very good guns and has cheaply made internals. I would recommend getting JG or G&G. These brands have high quality internals. If I had a chance to buy this gun again I would not.
4,Good starter!,Good weapon for starters. Weapon shoots really good and with good velocity. Have had some problems with the magazine using full auto. Overall good.
4,Good resource,Easy to read and follow instructions. Great tips to those new to juicing. Would have liked more specific info on specific fruits/veggies as when they were in season.
1,Not what I expected. :(,"If you're looking for healthy recipes this isn't the book for you. It's mostly sweet sugary fruit drinks, and hardly anything on healthy veggies. My wife has type II diabetes so this book was a waste of our money. Would make a great book for people looking for summer alcohol drinks."
1,Major Bummer.,"Well, I knew it wasn't going to be the same with Ville on vocals. I don't like Sentenced, so I hoped he would emulate Juha-Pekka Leppäluoto's voice. He didn't. It bugs me. Knowing this, I tried to get into Charon (J. P.'s voice is what I adore about Poisonblack). However, Charon's songwriting isn't dark enough to support J. P.'s voice! So, unfortunately, ""Escapexstacy"" is all that appeals to me from this group of Finish artists. This one was a disappointment, sonically. I love the lyrics, but I miss the powerful vocals."
4,GREAT!,"This is everything that their previous CD wasn't. A great gothic rock release. I'd heard alot about them over the years, but was just alittle dissappointed when I got ""escapexstacy"". It was too 80's soft rock. It didn't challenge. I still liked it though.THIS CD has alot more of a harder groove, and the songs themselves are catchy and razor-sharp. The vocals are a great improvement. I anticipate many plays in my car stereo."
5,Great music,"If you like hard rock with a great message then this album is for you. The sound is great, the production is suberb and Johnny's voice is amazing. Rod's guitar playing is superb."
2,Overblown,"Porcupine Tree finally has made it to the major leagues, and the technical side of ""In Absentia"" reflects that. The sound is crisp and booming (credit engineer Paul Northfield), but the soul is missing from the songs.It appears that Steven Wilson has had a field day in the studio, for every track on ""In Absentia"" is littered with excessive effects. (The tired ""voice on the telephone line"" effect is used on at least three songs alone!) The effects detract from anything that Steven Wilson might be trying to say -- either lyrically or musically.If you're new to Porcupine Tree, check out ""Lightbulb Sun"" or ""Stupid Dream"" for the band's melodic side and ""The Sky Moves Sideways"" for their prog side instead."
4,Stereo Program is not 24-bit,This review pertains specifically to the DVD-A.Another outstanding Porcupine Tree recording. But I have to ding the DVD-A one star (from 5 to 4).I own the audio CD and purchased the DVD-A specifically for the High Resolution Stereo tracks.However the Stereo program is 16-bit (same as the audio CD) not 24-bit.This is the first DVD-A I have found on which the Stereo tracks are not 24-bit.Very odd. Caveat Emptor.
4,Draciel,This blade rocks! I also got a wing attacker and this blade killed it! I would get this blade if you want to get a begginer blade and also advansed and not expert.
5,StaRtiNg DeFeNsE,"draciel is a little blade that cud deceive you. it looks weak and simple, but its actually great. the greatest thing about it is when it counters attacking blades really hard. i made it spin for 2 min 5 sec. the best trick to do for this begginner blade (which cud even make you win tournaments) is to dip the blade base's tip in baby oil and switch the weight disk to an 8 balance one. That upgrade can win you a tournament."
5,Outstanding work!,"Mr. Dale wrote a fine book. It covers all aspects of Kiss career, including business deals, musicians, recording sales, always remembering that they were dedicated professional musicians with ambition, since the start, and not only a bunch of fakes. It's much better than authorized Kiss biographies."
3,If you like KISS - pick up the book.,I picked up Black Diamond after just reading KISS & Tell by Gordon Gebert and Bob McAdams.Black Diamond was more biographical as was KISS & Tell was pure entertaining reading. I couldn't put K & T down. Black Diamond is for pure KISS fans. K & T is just hilarious reading and for anyone.I recommend BD but I had also just read K&T and I was just blown away by that book. Get them both if you can.
4,Ruby Payne gives good info & insight,"Ruby Payne is knowledgable and helpful. Easy readThere are some neat video clips on YouTube of Ruby Payne public speaking on the subject of hidden rules among different classes of people. Same info as in this book.This book is as valuable for a housewife who might wish to use it to enculturate her kids.As it is for her friend who works at DHS dealing with people of differing mindsets.Poverty mindset, Middle Class mindset and Wealthy folks minset. And combos of the 3.The information in the book is clarifying and validating. It is fun to identify where YOU are coming from as you read this book! It has a chapter with a checklist for you to fill out to see what category/categories you fall into.Other Top Human Behavior Specialists include:Daniel Goleman [...] (emotional intelligence. EQ vs. IQ)Dr. John Demartini [...] (identifying our personal top values that drive our behavior)Dan Pink [...] (tapping intrinsic motivation)"
4,quick n dirty,"The seller I bought this from sent me 2 for the price of 1! The seller was ExpressBuy123. They say these style of sharpeners can chip your blade and that Im sure is true, but its not a big concern for me. This is the fastest and easiest way to sharpen a knife."
1,Cant tell it worked,"I have used several sharpeners in the past.. I normally use stones but purchased this to do quick touch ups.. It didn't work very well, if at all compared to other brands of the same type of sharpener.. Looks like gerbDr just put their name on a cheap sharpener that doesn't work well"
2,all right it's about Selkirk,sElkiRk NeW York is the sure-fireway of reasoning beyond the rural New York Robitussin-inducedhangovers which preside indefatigablyin South Fallsburg New York the place-settingfor an underrated little boy named Alouiciousaced all the Latin exams then moved on to French andnever learned what it wasto liveby golly this is a great book!
5,A great performance of Gershwin classics,"There's not really a lot to say about this CD other than it is exactly what it claims to be - a fantastic performance of Gershwin's best. If you like Gerswhin, this'll do the trick for you. An American in Paris, Rhapsody in Blue and Concerto in F1 - his best - are all here.I got mine through a membership drive for a local classical music station. I hear a lot of other radio stations like to give away this gem; and with good reason. It's pretty damn definitive. If you keep an eye out for donation drives for your local stations you can sometimes get a copy this way."
3,Hard as a ROCK!,"With all the good reviews, I was so sure that this would be the answer to all my prayers....ah, NO. It's hard as a rock. I dont know what the fuss is all about but I can say that it does NOTHING for me but give me a headache every morning....Nuff said."
1,What is the appeal?,"Very repetitve! Not particularly creative, in the same genre as ""Nothing Going On But The Rent"". Wrong image to project. Never tolerate a freeloader, but learn to earn for yourself. You make the bills you pay the bills!"
2,Thanks For adding to the problems of the world.,"I'm a music lover ,who basically love his mellow tunes. The content of the alblum(writing on the wall) is totally unproductive to the relationship world. Dont get me wrong,this group has got a lot of harmony, Sure! they can sing but what wrong with writing and singing its all good music, happy song that you Can at least vibe at.(""So Good"" its not bad)Take an advice fron Chante Moore ""she's got a Man""."
2,"Unique lyrics, but annoying after awhile","This song is only OK. I think it's funny how they came up with all these types of bills. Other than that, this song gets soooo annoying after awhile. Listening to them repeat ""bills"" so many times makes me want to hurl something at the radio to make it stop playing that song."
1,One of the worst songs in America,I am so tired of the same old beats same old styles. I wish these artists could have came up with something better. Everybody has bills that is just the way of life. These ladies sound like they have nice voices. I really wish they could have used them to the fullest. Maybe they should have gotten better producers to write some good lyrics instead of trying to make a quick buck. I'm really tired of music being made at brothers and sisters expense. I would not buy this album if someone paid to.
2,What kind of message are we sending here?,"I was appalled by the lyrics in this song. It sends a message out there that women should be dependent on men for financial security. Get over yourselves, ladies! Pay your own bills. What a worthless waste of time to put a song out like this. I can't believe it gets any airplay. Tisk! Tisk! Destiny's Child. Try writing some more far-reaching lyrics about greater ideals or concepts. I can't belive the youth of today is absorbing this nonsense. I'll give them two stars for encouragement. --Kelly Magovern"
4,Fun!,"American Idol is a fun game that's easy to pick on and has a bit of a challenge. The object of the game is to tap either the ""A"" or ""B"" button when the cursor gets to the button icon. It's much like Frequency and Amplitude for the PS2. There are 3 types of modes; Competition, Rehearsal, and Endurance. Competition is where you work your way up to becoming the next American Idol. Rehearsal lets you practice you skills before moving on to the competition. Endurance is where you perform as many songs as you can but you must raise the charisma meter up to the designated area to move on to the next song. There are about 20 songs in all from various artists including Ricky Martin, The Monkeys, and even Elvis Presley. The only downside to this game is that instead of saving, you have to type in a password instead. Games like this annoy the crap out of me but this game is still fun, especially for the American Idol fans."
3,Way too thick,It's a really nice wallet. I like it's appearance and it can hold everything and then some. The only downside is that it's way too thick. It felt like I was sitting on a 2'x4'. I had to go back to my simple bi-fold wallet.
1,I thought it was satire!,"Reading this book, I began to think that it was meant to be satire.No one realy believes this conspiracy stuff, do they? Mormon connections in the CIA, FBI, basically a plan to take over the world.This book was entertaining, if a bit sad that someone took the time to write such silliness and thought it would be taken seriously.One star for the comedic content."
1,"Good Anecdotes, poor flow","The book is a bunch of short stories on Bear Bryant that have no logical / chronological flow. Tough being a college football fan who wants a better appreciation of Bear Bryant and can't get into it. Some of the stories the author does not even finish, sort of sets you up for the punch line without the punch. Bama fans probably love it, as an SEC fan I appreciate the stories, but it is a brutal read. Dissapointing."
1,boring and bland,"Being an African-American woman, and craving well-written, educational stories with black characters, I was excited about this book.Like a child on Christmas, I anxiously awaited its arrival. But boy, was I disappointed.It was said that the author Dawn Reno had composed a heart rending narrative.Talk about misleading the buyer. What a joke! I wasn't remotely touched by what I read.The story was under-developed in some enormously significant places.Edmonia was accused of murder, and a few sentences later, she was exonerated.Reno neglected to show Edmonia agonizing over her fate. There was no trial. Nothing.And worse than poor development, and a story that lacked depth, Reno's prose was as flat as three day old Pepsi. I realize that the story was written for young readers, but that is no excuse for drab writing.The book was a waste of money. I'd been better off donating the cost of the novel to a worthwhile charity."
4,stylish stories from the ghetto,"That title sums them up pretty well. i bought this a few weeks ago and they sent me the clean version which i was initially p*ssed about but then i realized its obvious what all the missing words are. on almost every track they spit a story about crime and it works well. the production is handled mostly by ski, so you know the beats are butter. on one track ski even hooks up a videogame sample. R.I.P. to Marlon Brando of the sporty thievz who gave his life pushing a child out of the way of an oncoming car."
1,Almost bought this TV...and glad I didn't!,"Looking for a nice, big, clean picture...at an affordable price. I saw this TV for sale in a Circuit City ad. Only $899. I inspected it. The tv looked OK, not as good as the other models like the DLPs. I was all set to buy it until I came back a day later and on closer inspection, I noticed that the TV was displaying the colors off and creating a ghost image of everything in red, yellow and blue. That looked terrible. I tried fixing the colors on it but to no avail. The sales rep at the store tried selling me the floor model for about $100 less and adding a warranty in; that just really confirmed my belief that this TV has major problems. This TV is big, bulky, presents horrible color and not worth the money. Save your money and go for a DLP TV. Although slightly more expensive, they are worth it!"
1,watch paint dry before this,"I cant believe I spent money on this insanely horrible movie. Honestly it wasnt bad as long as the female lead was fun to see, but once she was covered with mud and feces it was like stabbing yourself in the eye with a butterknife. Unless you lose a bet or a dare, do not watch this movie as it might encourage the writer and director to do something like it again..."
3,Great film but the ending was awful,"EDEN LAKE was a great movie. It was very tense and it played out how real people would actually go about a similar situation, in my opinion. But, the biggest flaw was the ending. I don't want to give it away, but the ending really just pissed me off. I can see how the director thought it was a good idea, but it was the ONLY thing that was bad about this movie. If they had gone the route I assumed they would go, I would have loved it. I recommend this movie to all. I would have given it a 5 star rating but i truly hated the seemingly rushed and completely unsatisfying ending. Some will say the ending was dark and disturbing. I thought it was cheap and boring. It is a haunting ending, but I wish it was in a different movie."
4,GOOD MOVIE,"I would consider this a good movie. But it is a typical "" woman in the woods, running from crazy kids"" sort of survival film.However the ending was definitely not to my liking.... unless they are planning to make a sequel."
5,Wonderful Film!,"I loved the twist at the end of the movie. I pride myself on figuring out whats going to happen or 'who did it', but this one took me by surprise! This is one I would watch again, I watch very few a second time."
4,Depressing,"I had the misfortune to watch this movie and unfortunately I couldn't turn the channel. That's why I gave this movie 4 stars. I was invested in seeing the main female protagonist find justice. Like the Road, I felt depleted when it finally ended. I was so mad when Eden Lake ended that I imagined a sequel which had a more satisfying ending.If you like horror movies with depressing endings, see this movie."
4,Bubbaville:Seventeen Stories,"One can recognize some of the characters in Bubbaville because all small places have at least one of them. The small-town police, the occasional redneck, the uneducated, and mostly males in groups discussing women can easily be recognized. The way the men stereotype women is probably a universal theme. There is a story for everyone in this book."
3,only die-hard lynch fans need apply,"A collection of most of David Lynch's art, Images shows his wide range as an artist. Stills from his various movies accompany his paintings, photographs, and other mediums. Images is enjoyable as a coffee table book that can be perused now and again but isn't a necessary addition to a David Lynch collection. Using mostly personal photgraphs and unviewed art the book tends to be someone eclectic even for an average Lynch fan. Mildly interesting, and fascinatingly personal, the book does give a behind the man view of a usually very private artist.There are some gems in the rough, but only the truly interested will benefit."
4,Threads of the Past,"I was amazed at the intrigue surrounding a few threads found after having been under water for 50 years. Mysteries from the past are interesting and this was no exception. Betsy, her employees and friends wove a great story blending past and present. Needlework played its part, but a knowledge of the craft is not necessary to enjoy this entertaining story."
5,A beautiful deck.,"This deck with the beautiful,inspiring pictures of ladies and knights are for all who love the paintings of the wonderful artist Sulamith Wulfing.You can use it as an oracle,or have it for the pictures.When I use it as an oracle,I study what the picture has to say,as Sulamith wanted us to do with all her work.The text on the cards are not bad,but not by her.You can give it to a small child,because the pictures could well illustrate fairy tales,and they have an uplifting,inspiring, and pure image of what love should be.It reminds me of the Swedish John Bauer.The cards are small,and easy to carry with you,to remember that there are such things as true love."
2,where is the first movement??,"While it may be a great recording, the absence of the first movement means that for me it cannot be a first choice for this wonderful symphony. It's certainly a good deal at this bargain price, but if this is your first Bruckner 8 I would spend the extra $8 and get the Boulez, or splurge on the 1989 version Karajan recorded, again with the Wiener Phil, which is electric."
3,Doesn't stay in place...,Well it smelled REALLY REALLY bad upon opening but that's not to bad to get over. It's quite comfortable as well. My only problem is that the bottom is supposed to almost stick to your desk so it stays in place and within 2 days the stickiness was gone and now I have to constantly move it back into place.
3,weird book!,"This is a one-of-a-kind novel. For the substance/story I give it 5 stars. For style, 1 star. WHY? The author ""exclaims"" sounds. For example, ""The beast hissed. Hisss. He shot it. BAMM. It hissed again. HSSSS. Hisss.""My wife thought it was a cartoon style, while I thought the author must be a children's book author who forgot to drop these conventions. The editor should have cut all of them. But if you can get through that, it is a terrific thriller. Unique, and unforgettable beasts.Pegleg"
2,you decide!,"Not high on my priority of EJ albums to have. I liked the version of ""Shine on through"" but in general I thought that too many 3-4 minute songs were needlessly dragged out, with the addition of synthesizers and percussions, to undesirable lengths. Elton explores an interestingly variable voice range in bellowing out certain selections. Some may like this better than me...but caveat emptor."
2,Great toy -- breaks in a heartbeat,"Purchased these for my four year old twins who love puzzles. They worked fine to start, but after a few days they both broke. They weren't subjected to rough play or anything, but now some of the states don't work, and they go off at random times, like when you walk near them, or turn the lights in the room off. I've had to take them out of the kids' rooms because at all hours of the night I would hear ""Idaho -- Boise,"" and ""California -- Sacramento."" I was extremely dissatisfied with their durability."
1,Do NOT waste your money!!!!,"I purchased this puzzle in order to help my daughter learn state placement, as well as the capitals of each state. I thought it would be a fun, interactive way to reinforce what we were working on. Well, the puzzle is simply junk. You pull up a state, it gives you the incorrect capital. For example, it randomly starts spitting out states and capitals when you select Florida, it claims you are placing Austin, Texas onto the board. It is extremely confusing for someone who is just learning where each state is located. If you want your child to think that Louisiana is located near Idaho, this is the puzzle for you. Also, some of the states aren't cut individually which adds to the high level of confusion. Please, do not waste you money on the puzzle like I did."
3,I wouldn't recommend to a friend,"I got this for my son because I thought it would be fun and educational. The problem is that the talking is SO annoying and there is no OFF switch! He gets very annoyed with it because if you even just pass one of the pieces over one of the states on the board the guy starts talking. And he is so stern. The very worst part is if you misplace a piece then store your puzzle out in the open, every time you turn on the light the guy recites which pieces are missing! The first time it did it is scared my son and his friends badly. I had to put a blanket over the puzzle so light could not reach it so the man would be quiet. Overall I would recommend just getting one that does not talk. The ON/OFF feature missing is a huge deal breaker on this one. Wish I could send it back!"
1,Cracked! Plus no packaging!,"If you buy this do not expect to get it in a box, plastic or manufacturer wrapping, it comes with nothing, just the gel pad. Also it was shipped in a thin one ply bubble envelope, and the plastic was cracked! This was supposed to be a gift, but EXTREMELY disappointed now and have to return it! :( You, Amazon, should be ashamed of yourself!"
3,strange release - not the best CD,"This 'If You Had My Love' US Maxi release is very strange. It comes with 5 mixes of 'If You Had My Love' and a rare mix of hit with Marc Anthony, 'No Me Ames' (Spanish track).The tracks are:1 If You Had My Love: Radio Edit - Good, but why no album version instead?2 If You Had My Love: Pablo Flores Mix Edit - Edit version of full club mix.3 If You Had My Love: Darkchild Mix Edit - Edit version of full club mix.4 If You Had My Love: Pablo Flores Mix - The Full Club Version. However, do we need another mix of this?! What about Metro?!5 If You Had My Love: Darkchild Mix - Info on track 4.6 No Me Ames (with Marc Anthony): Tropical Mix - this mix is very rare and is the best mix of No Me Ames.So overall the CD is Okay / OK but the mixes for If You Had My Love by Darkchild is dull in some places because of the rap."
4,good protection,"I bought this Body Glove rash guard t-shirt for my husband and we were very happy with the quality. good sun protection, nice fabric, nice print on the front.my only cons, is that I had to return the first one I ordered because the cut is really tight, and it was too small."
5,EXCELLENT condition,This top arrived very quickly and in great condition. Bought this to keep me warm during water aerobics. I would probably order the next larger size as it is made to fit very closely and can be hard to get off when wet. Definitely would recommend!
4,this book rocks,"although i haven't finished this book yet, i can tell that i really like it. meyers writes on an level uncommon among other novels i've read. he grabs the attention of the reader and doesn't let it go until he sees fit.i picked up this book in geometry class, (yes, i'm reading a book of this magitude while a freshman in high school) after having been reading it for a week or so, and for the last ten pages before part three begins, i couldnt put it down. i missed the entire lecture because it was so captivating.i would highly recomend this book to anyone who is looking to expand their thinking beyond their 3-demensional comfort zone, or anyone who just wants something to make them think."
3,Very disappointed,"I am a chief resident in orthopaedic surgery currently studying for my written board exam. As I have read through this text I have been consistently surprised by the number of blantant mistakes and inaccuracies, especially since this is the SECOND edition. Example: anatomy of ulnar nerve at the wrist p. 544--absosutely wrong; several of the anatomy diagrams have no lables (which were included in the 1st edition); many non-sense sentences such as under discussion of the patella: ""Somewhat triangular in shape, the apex of the patella gives rise to the patella, and they fuse sometime between the second and sixth year of life."" It reads as though is was written by a medical student instead of ""the most reliable experts in the field"" as touted on the cover. Not worth the [money]."
4,Works well but not perfect,The cards feed properly and print well. Cards and envelopes of good quality. Print quality is not quite as good as good quality matte inkjet paper for photo reproduction hence the four stars. I would love to have the same card in a premium quality for about 20-25% higher retail price.
5,Make your own invitations or announcements,"This is an easy-to-use product for making invitations, announcements, or note cards - all custom made with photos, text, clip-art, etc. After printing, they separate cleanly for a professional, store-bought look. A super tool for making your printer earn its keep!"
5,A winner indeed,"Mr. Dorsett, thank you for this book. I loved D.L. Moody before I read this, but love him even more now. Thank you for such a wonderful book and a more rounded look at Moody's life. All in all, an excellent read."
4,Good read,"Fast, easy read. Very enjoyable. The story takes place during the Carter Administration where ignorance and intolerance of foreign affairs take place. Interesting history and good references to that time. I am looking forward to more of Taylor's books."
4,Great hard-SF ideas after a long time!,"This was the first Banks book I've read and it is really mindblowing technological SF. Not much in the way of ""new"" physics, but the best mix of space tech, AI, advanced civilizations and conflict that I've read in quite a while. The canvas is huge, the machines are cool and the society is totally where we wish we were. If you're into SF you may have seen some of these ideas in other books, but this is one which integrates all those things into a single volume. Definitely a ""buy"" recommendation - unless you have a short attention span and prefer TV. I guess I want to see more of Banks' books and it helps if my reco makes it profitable enough for him to revisit his marvellous universe."
4,Iain M. Banks is getting reviewed here,"I have decided that I love Banks.The only thing that makes me squirm in his books, ever, is his insistence on giving the main character a flaw that always strikes me as inconsequential, and demeaning to the story.If he has a fondness for a planned society, or harbors sympathy for a ""socialist"" economy, he has my deepest regrets. The day will come when everyone is so wealthy that money won't matter any more. But we won't get there by ""redistributing"" wealth.I loved The Player of Games, from the first page to the very last. The only book I've liked better is Fearsum Enjinn, however startling the dyslexic narrator happened to be."
2,mis-leading title,"This book's title mis leads the reader intobelieve that the issue of Jesus God or Son of Godwill be discussed and arguements compared.However, it puts forth arguements to supportanother doctorine entirely."
1,JW methods clearly showcased!,"This book appears to be a fair study of what the scriptures have to say about Jesus's deity, but is it? It is published by TellWay publications, an arm of the Watchtower Organization (check out TellWay's Web site!) which has nearly 100 years of experience keeping its doctrinal bias out of its books! This book accurately shows how well they do that. That is, I highly recommend this book for all who want to become more familar with the teachings of the Jehovah Witnesses, but not for those who want to become familiar with the important themes of the New Testament."
5,Outstanding!,"This book delivers. This is the real thing. I can't say enough good things about this book. Short on theory, and long on instruction, this books allows you to jump right in and get started reaping the incredible benefits of nei kung. I've practiced many qi gong exercises over the past twenty years, with excellent success, but nei kung is better. In a very short amount of time you will have better posture, stronger legs, greater flexibility, better sleep, a lot more energy, a better attitude, better concentration,and a greater ability to be calm and relaxed. And that is only the beginning! Anybody who wants to improve the health of their body, mind, and spirit all at the same time should be practing this system of nei kung on a daily basis. Start slow and don't quit. There is now a video available from his website. chutaichi.com"
5,the little guys,"Yes these are the little guys of progressive compared to the huge success of people like Genisis, E,L & P and YES. Greenslade like Camel, Fruupp, Caravan and Gentle Giant were the second tier. Even though Greenslade had a pedigree line-up Tony Reeves,Dave Greenslde & Andy McCollugh, and the very unique voice of Dave Lawson none of their albums were released stateside except the 4th album ""Time and Tide"" came out on Mercury but they were soon dropped, and the only US tour ever was cancelled. This first album shows every thing thats great about them,super tight rhythm section, Classical and Bluesy riffin, and the singing arragements by Lawson are really special, like a friendly Peter Hammill without the darkness, great English classical rock...Easy cd to find compared to their others, Recommended to Loyal old proggies..."
3,Worth mining,"3 1/2Little known progressive act delivers a surprisingly adept and personal entry amidst the flooding of early 70's output. Abandoning most traditional guitar based rock values for grander keyboards and operatic-y vocals should have fans of Gentle Giant to 90 Day Men intrigued. Though minor missteps overwhelm the album as a whole, the sound and approach mainly remains engaging still, surprising in itself given the glut of prog we had at the time, and how much has fallen by the wayside since."
1,Let's talk it over-Grayson Hugh,"I need to know if the song, Let's talk it over, it by Grayson Hugh. I need it for a bithday present and I can not find Grayson Hugh anywhere. PLEASE HELP IF YOU CAN!"
3,"Works like it should, but built cheap","The device does what it is supposed to do, But it is built cheap. The plastic near the usb plug feel like it is pulling away from the connector chip. I didn't really expect anything better then this, but still not a four or five star."
5,Just what I needed,This is just what I needed. I took a hard drive from an old laptop and used this enclosure. Took 10 minutes to get it working. Two screws to hold the drive. The USB cord provided has a second plug in case your USB does not have enough power.
4,"not as expected, but . . .","I had actually expected a more detailed discussion, but he does pack a lot of information into a few words, so I'm not disappointed."
5,"A small, remarkable film","I knew nothing about this film -- found it online -- and it is quite remarkable. Based on a stage play, with I gather, all the original cast (except Colm Meany?), it has been translated to film with intelligence and deep feeling. It was my first time to watch a film that is almost entirely in Irish (with English subtitles), and the story is both wrenching and touching. It does, as one of the actors says in the special feature section, which should most definitely be watched, speak to the issue of emmigrants/immigrants from any country. Beautifully done."
2,"Great sound, great interpretation","One of my favorite multi-channel recording of big orchestral music. Very detailed sound with a nice 3D image of the orchestra. Excellent dynamic. Good recording to demo a multi-channel sound system.Great interpretation. The conductor let the orchestra loose in the loud passages, but keep control when the music demands it.In particular like the energy of the 3rd movement and the contrast with the bleakness and despair of the finale."
4,Classic Mayall and Friends,"This is a great album. I have 24 Mayall albums of which the best is 'Life in the Jungle'. This album contains many of the tracks on 'Life' and shows the abilities of Mayall, Montoya and Trout but lacks the same recording clarity. However, it is a recording you must have if you are any kind of Mayall, Montoya or Trout fan."
1,Monotonous is the word for this score!,"Horner has failed the listener and displayed a total lack of imagination with this score. The same short melody is repeated over and over again throughout the sixteen tracks on the CD. Charlotte Church is even made to sing it, and that does not in any way add anything worthwhile to the overall effect of the music. If you were sane before you listened to this soundtrack, you won't be afterward. It's grating."
3,Haven't I heard this before?,"As other reviewers will tell you yes this is another Horner machine made soundtrack. But it still sounds good! If you are a Horner fan by all means buy it otherwise ""at your own risk""!And another thing that gets me is no one even bothered to mention ""Alicia Discovers Nash's Dark World"" I happened to like this one this is the song that plays when he is in the hospital."
5,"A Haunting, Original Work Of Beauty","This is James Horner's most original score. Song one is the best, it effectively uses vocals, piano, and orchestra to create a tear jerkingly beautifull main theme.Song one just prepares you for what you are about to experience. After that, just enjoy the ride, it is an awesome experience."
3,Out of date and miss informatin,"The book needs to be updated. It has a lot of miss information on costs and only provides phone numbers, no email address, for contact information. Good for the basics but Fodors, Fommers and Rich Steves' Venice are better."
4,WHEN IS SOMEONE GOING TO DIE?,"I enjoy reading Joanne Fluke's Hannah Swenson Mysteries. They are light reads that not only are mysteries, but also have recipes with the recipes. This story of her's was not her best. I was almost half way done with the book, and there was no murder or mystery. Usually mysteries have murders earlier in the book. The author wrote about her cat endlessly. The story was cute, but I wouldn't say it was her best story. Try another of hers if you want a better mystery."
1,So-o ridiculous; as bad as a sleazy soap opera!,"This series keeps getting worse and worse. I've been hoping that it would get better, but alas--I'm afraid not. Hannah becomes more immature in each book. I've decided that she doesn't deserve the ""decent"" boyfriend--the one who would make an honest commitment to her. She does deserve the other one who lies to her and tells her continually that he is sorry for looking at and dating other women all the time. Come on! Where are her brains? I think the story should focus more on Lisa--she's the smart partner. Even Hannah's sister Andrea is a more interesting character than Hannah. I'd like to know what Joanne Fluke is trying to prove here. As she's writing each book, is she deciding that she doesn't like Hannah, so therefore portraying her as such a 'bimbo'. She's losing me as a fan of her writing."
5,Mystery Lover,When I started with the Hannah Swensen Series I was just looking for a new author I started with cherry cheesecake Murder and then found the ordeer of books and am currently on key lime pie. I think this series is one of the most amusing I have read in a long time. I love the mystery I love the humor it is the best of both worlds. On top of that my husband loves the cookies. I hope Joanne continues to write Hannah novels and I hope Hannah marries Norman.
4,Did competition drive Hannah to murder?,"This is book #7 in the Hannah Swensen cozy mystery series. Hannah owns a small, quaint, cookie/coffee shop in a small town in Minnesota. Her mouthwatering recipes for cookies are sprinkled throughout the story. In this book, the Magnolia Blossom Bakery opens across the street from Hannah's shop. It is putting a serious dent in Hannah's business. She's concerned that if things don't change soon, she will go bankrupt. In addition, the beautiful owner of the new bakery, Shawna Lee, has been seen around town with Hannah's boyfriend, Mike. Then one night Hannah finds Shawna's dead body in the kitchen of the Magnolia Blossom Bakery. Hannah, of course, is a lead suspect. She needs to find the real killer to clear her name."
3,A good book,"This book isn't absolutly in the same ""line"" than the other Black's Stallion's, but it's a good book anyway. I do not agree the comment from the review wich says that Steven Farley forgot the age of his readers."
3,The Future is Sustaianble Architecture,"It is an extremely interesting volume... of iummense use... to Built-Design professionals as well as amateurs. But personally speaking, it is not the amateurs, but the professional built-design professionals, who have to be bull-dozed into accepting green architecture. Wish something more can be done about it. H K Verma Editor Interiors Today - India's only Magazine for Built Design professionals Bombay interior@bol.net.in"
1,save your time,"Please....read the reviews here and thought seeing it was worth a shot. If you like lame dialogue, self-absorbed characters and unamusing dreg, this movie is for you. I much prefer the Alicia Witt of The Sopranos. Oh yes, and I could not cut out the subtitles from the screen."
3,The Broil King is King,"Nice griddle. Heats up evenly across the surface. The Teflon surface is as slick as a whistle and provides minimal stickification.My only complaint is the item comes disassembled. No big deal because all you have to do is flip that puppy over and screw in 4 little screws.If you can actually get the screws to drive thru the thick plastic handles into the metal grill. What a disappointment attempting to screw in the extra-short screws thru a thick plastic handle into the metal griddle. The handles are NOT secure, one or more of the screws is always popping out.I had to go to the hardware store and get 4 screws about 1/8 of an inch longer. Why not just provide the right equipment to begin with.Other than that the griddle cooks like a champ !"
4,Great AMERICAN product,"Despite all the reviews about short screws we purchased it as we wanted to buy American. Unfortunately the screws are still loose, they seem long enough,just don't tighten. Heats well,like the fact there is no grease tray running around the whole unit to get filthy. Drains into grease dish only. Worth putting up with the screws to buy American, but problem should be fixed."
5,Effective arrangement for moderately paced exercise,"Planning a musical arrangement for exercise can be a bit of a trick due to the requirement of strict consistency of tempo. Many songs while enjoyable simply aren't viable due to their resulting in the listener not being able to sustain a uniform cadence for the duration of their workout.I've found the selections of this arrangement to be effective for moderately paced exercise. Either a brisk walk, medium settings on an elliptical, or casual bike riding. If a more vigorous exercise regimen is what you're pursuing then a different selection may be in order. However, if your planned exertion level is along the lines of what I described above then this selection will most likely serve you well."
3,Works,"This was a gift for my son who was 11 when he got it. He used it constantly and was very happy with it. He took it on vacation with us and would not stop taping. Unfortunately, it just gave out after about 10 months of use. I have no idea why. It just will not stay on. We have changed batteries and tried charging it different ways. My suggestion is, if you cannot get this at a very low price, go find something else. A V-Cam is probably better quality."
5,Groundbreaking book on self-esteem!,"Honoring the Self contends that self-esteem is the single most important factor for a fulfilling life. Author Nathaniel Branden notes that the greatest barrier to love is the fear that we are unlovable - which is why self-esteem is so critical.He describes self-esteem as the combination of self-confidence and self-respect. The former pertains to competence and the latter pertains to personal worth.To generate positive self-esteem, Branden suggests making a commitment to awareness (a commitment to thinking as a way of life). He says independent thinking about our work, relationships and values will guide our life, and thus enhance our self-esteem. He also emphasizes the importance of integrity, self-responsibility and self-acceptance in building self-esteem.For anyone looking to enhance their self-esteem, or to raise children with high self-esteem, this is a ""must have"" book."
5,outstanding debut...,"what i like about european bands to a certain extend is their accent, put them above the crowd without doubt. Laura has a good voice and the arrangement in this album is very good. brilliantly produced."
4,Great goto guide to keep your four legged babies healthy and happy!,"Very informative and has lots of facts for safety! Great recipes for caring for lots of domestic pets. Would like a tad more details, but very glad I got it!"
4,Holistic Aromatherapy for Animals,"I'm always interested in any helpful info about animals. I have three Yorkies and a Shih Tzu (one Yorkie recently passed away). I love my doggies and read anything and everything I can to help them live a long, happy life. This is pretty good adivce, but haven't used any recommended usage yet."
3,A Civilized Man,"Thoughtful essays, reprinted fr the '60s. Keep yourvoice down, said an older culture, think of the peoplenext door. But what if the people next door are Dauchau-Hiroshima-Selma people?Meantime, w the media, the message of ""overkill"" becomesa cultural phenomenon. Sex studies take us into abstractionand pharisees like Philip Roth-Stanley Kauffmann piouslydefend homophobia.What does one make of a closeted Sontag who belches comicinvective to gain attention? It's the Age of McLuhan and,w Sontag, I add, it helps to sip with publisher Roger Straus,if you don't gag.A longtime English prof at Amherst, DeMott speaks with asane voice. He's a civilized man."
5,Second Chance,"Mark, we loved it! Kahara reminded me of Betty, when we first got married, I had to ""dispose"" of some of her culinary creations (esp the biscuits!!!), but she got it together quickly as my big ass is a living testimonial. Anyway, the movie moved at a good pace, never boring or dragging scenes out. Plenty of humor, Betty thought it was funny taking Monica to jail, your explanation had me cracking up. Ol' girl had a condom ready for the third round! The love scenes were cool, tasteful, not too graphic but definitely adult, as most of us can relate to the different situations. It's the type of movie that one has to see several times to get the full enjoyment out of it. Tha acting was great too. I hope Ms. Matlock does another soon, as long as you're in it!"
3,Happy For A 5th,"Dynasty Warriors 4 is fairly exciting, in that you have lots of characters to choose from; three different kingdoms to fight for, and six outfit changes you can earn as you grow in experience. What I don't like, is that the musou modes for each character are exactly the same depending on the Kingdom they belong to (monotony on a disk). I love DW everything, but was very happy they came out with DW5, and it's companion Xtreme Legends. I LOVE the Destiny Mode, which is lacking on Xtreme Legends 4. That's fine, they've progressed in 5 which is a welcome change. One thing that urked me about DW4 is that the characters can't move freely while they're attacking. So you end up going in a straight line, where there are no more enemies to kill. This leaves the character open to attack from behind (now where's the honor in that, Mister AI guy)"
3,Dynasty warriors 4?,"I assumed the fourth installment would be an improvement over the third. While there are a few interesting additions the graphics seem inferior to Dynasty Warriors 3. While it is still fun, I have found myself back to playing the old one more."
5,I can't stop playing this game,"I am completely addicted to this game and I am much too old to be spending this much time playing video games but I can't help myself with this game. I have made it my mission to try to complete Musou modes with all the characters and MAX out the abilities of each. It will take forever, I know. The good thing is I have had this game for over a year and somehow I have not tired of it. Thanks Koei for making such a great game.(...)"
3,It is okey.,"I thought that Dynasty warriors 4 is way too frustrating. Dynasty warriors 3 was a epic adventure. DW3 was fun and perfect. But now DW4 is a shipwreck waiting to happen. The only things I like about it are the edit mode, The orbs, And the improved graphics. The levels are colorless, The menu screens are plain, and the weapons arent very interesting. I loved the way that you got weapons in the DW3, But now you train weapons like pokemon. Just like pokemon evolve, the weapons evolve. When I play this game I feel like I am playing Pokemon Ruby instead of Dynasty Warriors."
4,dancetastic,"this compilation came out when the electroclash scene was peaking, but the quality here hovers way above anything else that genre has to offer. Ghostly got some of the best electronic artists from around the world to create tracks inspired by the robot-disco sound pioneered by Giorgio Moroder (producer for Donna Summer among others).best inlcusions:Adult.- they offer their poppiest song ever hereDaniel Wang- lovely melody and productionSolvent- his first song with vocals, i thinkLegowelt- this track reminds me of the snow level in Sonic the Hedgehog 3Mat-101- lots of cool production effectsthe only disappointment is the song from Susumu Yokota, which is basically an uncredited cover of Donna Summer's 'i feel love', but not very interesting. he's done way better. although this record is a compilation, it has a very cohesive feel overall. very upbeat, slick, and fun."
5,Super Sexy Read,"This story was wonderful! I've read several of Jane's books and this one is my favorite so far. Emotionally engaging battle of wills keeps you turning pages until the very last one. Well Done, Jane!"
4,A few more comments ...,"I mainly agree with the two earlier reviews and wanted to add a few comments. The notes for this recording, written by Peter Lamb, are rather dismissive, and the key of Fanny's composition is misspelled (should be D minor instead of D major). Additionally, I wondered why the cover mentions Fanny's maiden name but not Clara's. Apart from that, the recording is quite beautiful."
5,LOVE it!,I love this product! I have blonde eyebrows and most pencils look like i drew my eyebrows on with a pencil...lol But not this one! It goes on great and stays on. I will buy it again... :)
3,Should be Advanced 3-Cushion Billiards,"This book contains very little information that will be of use to an 8 or 9-ball player and close to half of the book is spent discussing specific 3-Cushion shots. I bought this book for the defense section hoping to learn some more about that but again it related to 3-Cushion rather than anything for 8 or 9-ball. Since I don't know the first thing about 3-Cushion billiards, I can't say whether or not the information about that is good or not."
4,A great read - packed with action and scope for thought .,"A failed priestly student is enslaved by Norse raiders and, with the luck of the Irish has to act as a priest to stay alive. He fights against human sacrifice, forced conversions and the supporters of the old norse gods. He also struggles against himself and to support the Christianity of his new overlord who has crazy ideas like permitting his thralls to buy themselves free.* Warning, good value but if you don't need it for Christmas the ""Year of the Warrior"" a 2 in 1 with a full size, all new sequel added this will be out in March 2000. * Order now."
5,Another brilliant record...,"What can be said that hasn't been said already?? This is another great collection of songs from a superb singer/songwriter/guitarist that deserves a wider audience..If you haven't heard of Richard Thompson,then do yourself a favor and get this cd and then get Mock Tudor,Old Kit Bag,too.Also,see him live and see some amazing guitar playing! What are you waiting for???"
5,Superb Quality,"This is one of the better designed drivers Ive used in a long time. Features a contoured, padded handle. Nice long reach that wont slip as you turn it. Very high quality stuff here."
1,Not for beginners or advanced readers,"The concepts covered in the book are poorly explained and could be retrieved from the java documentation for free. The cs1 package that comes with the book uses text based concepts and does not work well with the oop idea that is central to java. A much beter package named javabook from the ""Introduction to Object Oriented Programming in Java"" by Thomas Wu gives an oop start from the first page and you can extend this package to give you all the tools you need to write a fully functional application."
5,Great book for 1st semester college programming class,"Recently, I received a telephone call to see if I could teach a university Java class. While I had to pass on the opportunity, one of the topics that came up was which book to use as a text. ""Java Software Solutions: Foundations of Program Design"" is just such a book. If you've been looking for a textbook to use in a beginning programming class, that starts from ground zero, check this offering out. About my only complaint here is I had trouble accessing the supplemental material from the website. Starting from basic computer processing, working your way through objects and classes, and finishing up with data structures (with lots in between), you'll find an excellent text for a first semester Java programming class. While this book is from Addison-Wesley, it is not part of the JavaSoft series."
4,Great for beginner of programming,"My professor recommended it when I studied principle of programming in year 1 of CS. It assumes u know nothing about programming. In this veiwpoint, it's really great since it explains the basic programming principles clearly through java. U know the concepts and how to implment them.However, if u know something about programming, u'll find it boring. If u take it as the first step to learn java, it's lengthy.It's great for beginner, especially if ur major is not CS."
2,A programmer who took a JAVA course using this as the text.,"I didn't like this slightly disjointed book. The authors must not have checked out their code since there were many mistakes throughout the examples. While the prose was good in places, the authors tended to present coding examples before they had covered the topic. You had to read ahead before you could digest the code ... some times, way ahead. Their coverage of ""Event-Driven Programming"" obfusciated a relatively straight forward topic -- fortunately they did cover 1.1. I liked the summary of the main points of each chapter and Q&A (with answers). John Spence/"
4,Pretty decent book for beginners,"Having got advanced credit for an introductory Java course (because of 4 years experience in VB, and my academic background), but having no knowledge of the language, I decided to read this textbook on my own. While there were a few chapters that I didn't get a word of at first, I must admit that I couldn't have asked for a better beginner's book."
1,Buyer Beware-Horrendous Book!!,"I feel so sorry for all of the students out there who are struggling with this book, you arent alone! This book is poorly written, there is so much detail that I cannot follow the concepts. The chapters dont build on the previous ones. Worst of all, no answers are provided for the HUGE amount of exercises and programming projects. I am now in search of a better book to help me salvage my GPA. Thanks alot Lewis and Loftus."
1,Not a duct design or sizing manual,"Over-hyped. If your goal is to come away with the ability to design and install actual ventilation systems, i.e. ductwork, try again. Little accurately re-design or modify my existing ductwork. I actually spoke with the publisher before purchasing this book, and was assured this topic was covered!If you know of a book which addresses duct sizing and layout for the layperson, please email me!"
5,Grief Help for Children,"This parable is excellent for teaching children about death. The parent or caregiver reads the story and then has the opportunity to discuss it with their child. A page in the back provides tips entitled, ""What Can Parents Say?"". There are readings from the gospel of Matthew and Mark and a suggested prayer. This is a fantastic resource."
5,nice parable,"This is a great book that explains death in a parable even a young child can understand. The waterbugs keep seeing their friends ascend up a plant and go out of the water, but can't understand why. One bug vows to come back and explain it all when it happens to him, but finds he is a dragonfly with wings and can't possibly return to the water. It is a great way of explaining death as a positive transformation, in a manner that does't focus on any particular religion. This would be appropriate for people of all faiths and agnostics/ atheists."
3,Waterbugs and Dragonflies,"This book is very small! I was surprised as it appeared to be not much more than a glorified brochure, but upon reading the story is good for older children - 10 upwards. Its not visually exciting but the story is a nice way of thinking about death and the ""unknown"" aspect of death.Its an easy read for older kids but not for the littlies. I'll have to save it for when my child is older."
3,"""we all go to heaven and it's great""","I thought this was a nice story and my 6 year old daughter enjoyed it. However I think this story helps explain death only if you want to convey the notion that when we die, we all go to heaven and everything is just great. It didn't really address the nitty gritty of death and dying - like feelings of loss, or maybe a less ""heavenly"" ending like when you die, you die. It's definitely got a religious bent to it, but not in an overt way - just in a ""we all go to heaven"" sort of way. It's a nice story regardless of your personal beliefs. It's not offensive at all. However, the book does not necessarily explain death and dying, at least to me."
5,"Beautiful, heartfelt and inspiring","After having lost our son Adam in a drowning accident, I wanted a book to read to our children, ages 9 and 13 so that they could understand the concept of death. The book not only helped them but also helped my husband and I in our mourning. I recommend this book highly to anyone in the position of explaining or experiencing the loss of a loved one."
5,lovely cream,Having tried many many creams I love this product. It smells wonderful and is very gentle to my skin.
3,Just Dynasty Warriors with Extras,"Sure, this is an extended version of the fun game, Dynasty Warriors 3, but it is really nothing special. So it has musou mode for non-aligned characters, nothing special, since you can basically play the non-aligned side in the free mode in DW3 anyway, you just get an extra scene at the end like with the other kingdoms...really not worth [$$$] if you already have the DW3 original. And the weapons are not necessary either; you're already overpowered at your third weapon. Although is is useful and quite humorous to have characters as your bodyguards, they are no different from regular bodyguards: they still steal your kills. All in all, this game is not worth it if you already have DW3, but is a great deal for those who do not already own the original."
3,It's OK,Does what it is designed to do. Used twice. Did a fine job of applying latex solid stain to outdoor deck.
5,A MUST read BEFORE a projectmanager's 1e OO project.,"Booch talks about managing the object oriented project in his well known 'easy to read' style.The complete object oriented project life cycle is discussed in depth. This is great reading stuff for people only accustomed to the 'classic' Waterfall model. I personally was enlighted to read about the 'Prototype' or 'Proof of concept' phase.What makes the book exceptionally usefull are the 'Key Practices' and 'Rules of thumb'. These are integrated in the text, but also listed seperately in de appendices. These insights and experiences give the book a very pratical value. Certainly when not having any OO project experience yourself, these Key Practices and Rules of thumb give you a head start.This book is a MUST read for any projectmanager involved in managing object oriented software projects. Preferably before his or hers first object oriented project."
3,The Sony LCSBBA is a light duty case,"This is a very basic light duty soft case and it will accommodate any of the small Sony camcorders. It will save your camcorder fron getting scratched or from slight bumps. It offers no protection against drops or hard hits, since it has almost no padding. It is also bulky, but on the positive side it fits my Sony HDR-CX12 sitting on top of the docking station, cables and a spare battery. This case is just a zippered box with no additional compartments."
5,Like the driven snow...,"Wow! These lables are great! They arrived in a box, but not just any box- a blue box! They were rolled on two spools of 100% cardboard, perfect for my Dymo Label printer. It's like they were made for each other! The labels themselves were just right. They were rectangular with an aspect ratio that made them well suited for addresses (my primary use for them). They were so white, like little uniform, rectangular snowflakes. As a bonus, they were covered with adhesive on one side. Because of this, I could peal them off the backing paper (free!) and actually stick them on envelopes without using messy glue or tape. For anyone who addresses envelopes, this product is a must!"
3,Doesn't cover much of the Puget Sound Area,"This book mostly covers hikes around the Olympic peninsula, not in or around the Puget Sound/Seattle area, as might be indicated by the book's title. I was trying to find a hike near Seattle this past weekend, and the book fell completely short. The closest hikes to the Seattle area were more than an hour's drive away, which I wouldn't really consider to be in the Puget Sound area. The Olympic hikes look good, though, so all hope is not lost. They do have detailed information on the hikes that are featured in the book, though. I'd definitely recommend this book if you're planning on doing some hikes on the Olympic peninsula, but not if you're looking for hikes around Seattle and the Puget Sound area - there are some great hikes within Seattle (Discovery Park) as well as nearby (Issaquah alps), but unfortunately these are not covered in this book."
1,THE LAUNCHER THAT DOCENT WORK,I AM 11 YEARS OF AGE AND I GOT THIS TOY AND I WAS FINE WITH IT AT FIRST BUT THEN THE LAUNCHES BECAME WEAK. I WAS SO MAD BECAUSE WHEN I GOT IT I THOUGHT IT WAS THE BEST TOY EVER BUT NOW ITS THROWN IN MY CLOSET BECAUSE IT DOCENT EVEN LAUNCH FAR. i WOULD RECOMEND THE SPRING LAUNCHER EVEN THOUGH I HAVE NEVER USED IT BEFORE ITS GATTA BE BETTER THEN THIS.
1,What they don't tell you,"When you order this product you get a form to fill out and fax in. The idea is the keyboard protector is customized to your keyboard. What they don't tell you is that customizable only goes so far. I requested a keyboard protector for my HP Elite Book Lap Top. After several weeks, I received a notice telling me, ""this is a unit for which there is not a protector."" I have to request a refund."
1,Fellowes Keyboard Cover,"I didn't realize when I placed my order that I wouldn't get it right away. I got ANOTHER order form asking for more detail. Then it would not upload on their website, so I had to fax it and it's been 3 weeks and I'm still waiting for my order."
1,I LOVE YOU FAUDEL,"HELLO MY BEST SINGER JE SUIS SIHAM J4AIME BIEN AVOIR LE E MAIL DE FAUDEL CAR JE L AI RENCONTRE DANS LE MOIS DE SEPTEMBRE ET J AIMERAI BIEN PARLER AVEC LUI POUR LE DIRE A QUEL POINT IL ME PLAIT .

5,Wonderful....,I love this CD its the best in my collection its the only one i listen to anymore. It has so much feeling and meaning. I'm sure he has inspired many people. As well as me. I recomend to anyone with a heart.
4,This CD is perfect for listening or singing along.,"Edwin McCain has a beautiful, soulful voice that reaches into your soul. I love to listen to it in the car while driving to work. It helps to put me in the best frame of mind. I sometimes can't help but sing along. I also attach it to my massage mat with the earphones and just lie on the floor so I can feel the music as well as hear it. I liked all the songs the first time I heard them (which is rare for me)."
1,Burned Out and Emotionless,"Complete disappointment. If I hear ""I Could Not Ask For More"" one more time in the supermarket, I think I'll puke. This album is missing the emotion and song writing style of the first two albums that I love. I hope this is not the trend for his future music. Don't get me wrong, Edwin is one of my favorite artists, but this album is not one of his shining moments. Even after this, I gave him a free Ghost Notes T-shirt and a complimentary copy of the ""I Know What I Want"" CD. I suggest you skip this one and buy the ghostnotes CD instead."
5,You'll need label stock!,Dymo labels are consistently excellent and reasonably priced. I've used their products for 18 years without an issue. Shopping for a competitive vendor is easy and the results have been great for me!
3,"Great game for Trojan fans, DVD quality is OK.","I bought it because the game was showed tape-delayed here in Brazil, with some segments cut for time.This game was great for me being an USC Alum. Others will find it tedious towards the end, with Oklahoma being totally dominated.DVD quality is OK, no widescreen in it, and the image sometimes is a little choppy. The extras are mainly interviews, the Leinart announcement, and the ESPN Gameday after the game."
4,does what it's s'pose to.,"What can I say? it's a pedometer, it was cheap and it works. I bought it to make sure I got the recommended 10,000 steps a day. Wore it for a week and saw that without formal exercise I averaged 15,000. so I stopped wearing it. No need.Kinda cool that it calculates the number of aerobic steps and the Kcals burned. (you'll be saddened to see how few cals are burned.....).The only problem I had with it,was the little holster that came with it. Not heavy-duty enough for a busy nurse. Several times I brushed up against something and it went flying. Mind you, it works perfectly fine just sitting in your pocket, so no biggie. (although not all scrubs have front or hip pockets)."
4,Easy to use,This new pedometer has done everything it said it would do. It's very easy to use once you set it up.
1,don't wate your money or your time,"Yes it counts steps but it counts and counts and counts. It lacks a critcal feature for me---there is no way to set the day's count back to zero (say when you start a walk). It zeros at midnight, but that's it unless you want to zero out and recalibrate the whole thing. Even simple pedometer programs for a smart phone do that. Further no adjustment for sensitivity, etc, in case your stride is atypical. What a waste."
4,walker,"I purchased this product as I recently made the decision to walk 10,000 steps a day. This product has been very helpful in tracking this goal. The clip is not very strong and sometimes the pedometer will come loose if you bend. As long as you are aware, it does not seem to be a problem."
3,You get what you pay for,It's fairly simple to set up and operate but I guess in order to keep you from accidentally changing the settings the SET button is hard to press. I have to use a penic or something with a small point.The reset button resets the entire thing which means you have to go through and set it all up again.For $20 I guess you get what you pay for. Not sure yet how accurate it is. I am going to the track to see if it accurately measures 1/4 mile. That will help me to determine if my set up was correct.Edit: I walked 1 1/2 miles but it said I only walked 1.19 so it's not that accurate. Today I went for a walk and when I went to see the lapsed time/aerobic steps they were both zero so after two weeks it's broken.Another flimsy product from China.
4,Reliable if Programmed Correctly.,I bought this pedometer for my mother who has since taken up walking long distances. This is an excellent pedometer but make sure you correctly measure your stride distance before putting it to use. I found that if your measurements are off - so is the pedometer's way of counting your steps. I guess it's good that it's so sensitive and precise. The extra choice of clipping the pedometer to you is better than only having the option of placing it on your belt.
1,Does not count,This device failed to count the steps reliably despite making the documented setup steps. I ended up returning it and buying a Fit-Bit
3,Good for the price,I am using it for the past 1 year and found no issues with it. Note that there are other cheap pedometers in the market. I suggest to give it a try.
4,Just what I needed,"I bought this pedometer to help track my caloric burn during walks and it is perfect. Very easy to set up, large display and backup safety strap are features my last couple of pedometers didn't have. Fast shipping and great price."
4,No batteries included,"The product itself does everything it's supposed to, and I am very pleased with it. The problem was that batteries were not included, and I had to go out and spend another $8 for them. Amazon said that it says they weren't included, but I couldn't find where, and Omron thought they should have been."
4,Omron Pedometer,The pedometer works well - but I had to reorder as the first one was lost due to the fact that I didn't use the clear clip correctly. I am a Luddite and found the direction booklet difficult to understand. I did not read anywhere that you have to hit the mode button to review what has happened - as it kept reverting to 0's. But I am learning as I go
5,Get this ONE!,"After suffering with a cheap pedometer from a major sporting goods store, I turned to Amazon for some help. I LOVE Amazon and the customers who take the time to give such great information about a product. All the good reviews of this pedometer are true. The clip works great, it works in your pocket, clock works, it resets in the morning, you can see steps, miles and aerobic steps. I just can't say enough about this great pedometer."
