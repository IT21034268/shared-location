4,Great for my grandson,This was on one of my grandson's Christmas list and he was thrilled to receive it - unfortunately our DVD player was not hooked up so he had to wait until he got home to view it.
3,ok. how many ways can this story be told,"butthe action is funny, and there r new lines, but basically if u saw one and two u have seen this one."
3,"it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good.","Pretty predictable. No major funnies, even wth the proto-squirrel. Though the continental drift bit in the first three minutes was probably the best part."
3,"Good, not great","The kids enjoyed it, but not up to par with the other Ice Age movies. Worth renting, but don't expect too much."
5,LOVE MANNY,WE LOVED THE OTHER MOVIES. AND THIS ONE IS NO DIFFERENT. IT WAS VERY FUNNY. IT ALSO HAD A GREAT STORY. IT KEPT US IN OUR SEATS. AND FOR A MOVIE TO DO THAT TO MY HUSBAND IS HARD TO DO. IF YOU LOVED THE OTHER ICE AGES. YOU WILL LOVE THIS ONE ALSO.
4,Very cute,A great family movie that warms the heart and makes everyone feel good. The story and characters never get old and still warm the heart.
2,not even close to as the earlier ones,"This one is not even close to as witty and entertaining as the previous movies. My kids (11,13) even commented on it not being as funny.I would have to say 'don't bother'"
3,A good time for a little while,"I loved the previous stories, but this one is a little weak. It has a few humorous moments. it's just OK."
5,Fun Viewing,"If it's laughter you're looking for, this DVD will not disappoint. Like the others in this series, there's much levity and as usual, a nice message to be had. Can be enjoyed by any age."
3,I enjoyed it,What I didn't like was having to wait until the price came down to rent it. It was going for $15 (I guess to buy it) when I only wanted to watch it. I didn't like feeling made to buy it.
4,Well made shock buffer,"First of, thank the lord for interchangeable parts. Bought this for a skoda felicia station wagon and have come to learn that it has the same rear suspension as old VW Golfs. Have installed it and it works like a charm (extra spring rate in one direction only :)It doesn't come with a tie strap as the description states, but the bump stop has a groove to fit into the ""accordion"" rubber piece. It covers the entire shock absorber shaft and seems to be better than the KYB manufactured bump stop and shaft protector which appears more plastic in texture.Thanks again amazon for a wonderful product:)"
3,Not my cup of tea.,"If you actually ENJOY reading about Klingons, consider this a five-star review; the book is very well-written. I simply have a limited tolerance for Klingons, and I think I've exceeded it. Give me Vulcans, any day. I consider it a sign of the deteriorization of modern culture that whereas in the sixties & seventies, the alienated alien race that Star Trek fans emulated was the intellectual, cool, collected, unfailingly polite Vulcans, nowadays it is the warrior Klingons, who consider courtesy to be a sign of weakness."
2,more than I needed to know,"Way more technical than the anatomy I took for nursing. I can't think of why I would need to know the Greek and Latin names for bones and muscles to paint or draw them. I felt like I needed a terminology class to read the book. I was disappointed. Due to the name I thought it would be a lot more visual, very dry and laborious to read. I felt like the author(s) were flaunting their knowledge of the subject more than trying to teach artists the relevance of anatomy. I like Gray's anatomy much better"
3,good but..,"this is definitly an anatomy book. The only real art part of it is the fact that there are no pictures, they are all drawings. There is no insight into drawing the female figure but the muscle structure for the male figure is done well and shows range of motion. The private parts are excluded however (which I didnt mind at all). IT is an excellent resource for anatomy students but not much help for the artist. It will not teach anyone to draw the human figure."
1,It's a cartoon!,"This movie misrepresents itself with the title, the cover and the year. Amazon should be ashamed at this rip off of my $5 to watch 30 seconds of a cartoon before realizing I had been dooped."
2,the dark knight fails,i read the books. this video dose not compare. 2 books were stuffed into 1 hour. half of the story is missing. the time of day is wrong. the chronology is mixed up. example: joker wakes up early in the story and is the reason for the timer on the bombs. you missout on batman/bruces naration wich is a story all its own. a big fail for bruce tim i am sorry to say. read the book. it is far better.
2,Not What I Thought it was.,When I bought this I didn't actually read the product description very well. I didn't catch it was a animated version of the Dark Night. I had not actually seen the actually movie yet. When I went to view this I was shock it was animated. I think the product description could have been better written. Because I thought I was buying the movie that released this year in the theaters. I story line I felt was a little weak. Although I usually enjoy the comics this was not one of my favorites.
4,Thumbs Up!,"I liked the older, out of shape caped crusader. New villains are always welcome with me. I can't wait for part 2."
4,Great Adaptation Of One Of The Greats...,One of the greatest BATMAN stories ever gets a very well done adaptation from WB animation. Featuring a superb selection of voice talent including Peter Weller (Robocop) and Michael Emerson (LOST) as The Joker. Can't wait for Pt.2 to see much more of Emerson's performance. If you have never had the pleasure of reading Frank Miller's DARK KNIGHT RETURNS...this is a great introduction.
3,It was Ok,"I enjoyed it but it was very predictable. I expected just a little more from this annimated Batman, but it just wasn't there.Gerard Labrecque"
3,"Well...It's ok, I guess...",I will offer this sentiment. As a fan of the comic I found the visual translation for the most part excellent. There were some miscues and things that I just don't think they did correctly but it was for the most part accurate. What ruined it for me in many ways was the lack of the third voice. In the comic they let you hear what the characters were thinking. This added so much emotion and sometimes humor to the story. This not being included was such a huge miss. There were jokes unfinished and for the most part really made me miss the comic. The other miss was Peter Weller. He delivered his lines like Robocop...emotionless. There was no grit in his voice. Overall after paying for this I do not plan to get the second one. It was just not enjoyable for me. My son however did see it and not having a sense of the comics like it. This is the only reason it gets an ok instead of dislike. Guess if you don't know the comic you'll find it likable.
1,Complete crap!,This animated feature is well-animated but the dialogue is complete crap! I could only stand to watch the first ten minutes before turning it off.
4,great adaptation but great FAIL,"A good adaptation of the greatest batman story...But the ""adaptation"" is missing the most important element : Batman's voice over detailing his train of thought.A Major FAIL"
1,Deceptive,"The title is extremely deceptive. I thought I was purchasing the recent third episode of the Batman Trilogy, The Dark Knight Returns, but instead it was a cartoon. I didn't realize that I had a different product until I received it. Amazon should avoid this type of cleverly deceiving salesmanship."
3,not what i expected.,"this actually is a toy - i was expecting a prop-replica for collecting. it's sturdier than most masks, but it's not worth the price. great for a halloween mask, but that's about it. the other ""props"" from the 300 movie are just as bad. i came across them at a convention and those were even worse. the spartan helmet and shield were flimsy latex rubber. the sword was nice but lame, from a collector's stand point. i also came across the immortals mask at the convention, but i already had the product. had i known, i probably wouldn't have bought it. that's it."
2,"Couldn't really get into it,","Don't know what it is about this book, but it just didn't do anything for me. The plot is original and intriguing, but something just didn't work for me. It wasn't the characters, some of whom were likeable. It wasn't the villians, whom were quite cool--who doesn't like aliens, giant scorpion/crab/spider monsters, and derranged ape-people?I think it was the books predictability that made it a tedious read. Lumley never truly generates any real suspense or a sense of urgency, so as creative as some of the foes are, they're not terrible effective.I understand there is a sequel. Maybe I'll read that some day. If you're really into sci-fi, give it a read. It just didn't click for me.Real rating: 2-and-a-half stars."
1,Disappointing,"Repetitive, self-contradictory, predictable, boring. I still have a few pages to read and can't work up the energy to finishing reading them. The book is 100 - 150 pages too long, much of it is junk that could have been edited out. I have always been curious about Lumley's ""Necroscope"" series but now I wont even bother. I want my 7 bucks back.The characters uninteresting, their actions somewhat pointless. The situations they get into are not very interesting either.I thought is was odd that only the female charater kept getting her clothes ripped off as she ran through the woods, stupid. The ""vilian"" was totally unintersting and his behavior is never really explained in a way that makes sense for the story.The back cover exlaims ""ALIEN ATTACK!"" but there is no alien attack really, just one alien who has trapped a few people. I will stay way away from Lumley."
5,Oh Whoops! It's a good thing they sell seat covers...,I thought that this was the best thing since N SYNC!!
1,WORST EVER,"Ok, first of all, let's just get this outta the way. Do NOT buy this CD. It's horrible. The guitar sucks, and the voice is just......ew. It's terrible. At least the drums and bass are ok, but aside from that, it was a waste of time. Poor guys."
3,Smells good,I liked the smell but all of the other reviews were correct...doesn't last very long. Probably won't go to the trouble to buy it again.
3,its ok,"it just makes you smell sweet and fruity like a now later last a lil while,people do not come flocking to you"
3,Very sweet....,"And Believe it or not....The people who have mentioned they liked it....said...it does have an Aura....about it....One comment I received....""Id like to rip off your clothes!""Im serious!"
2,Pure instinct,I wanted something that was like the Pure Romance sex attract but cheaper. It's close enough except the smell fades really fast and I don't think any one can smell it on me. So now I use it in my vacuum :)
3,Pleasent fragrance.,"Smells nice. Light citrus long lasting fragrance. You only need to use a little. How well it works remains to be seen, but it is a nice fragrance to have."
2,Not what expected,The cologne smells good but i have not had any of the effects as everyone else has said they have.
3,i liked myself.,"So, i got this thinking you know it would make guys want to talk to me like i read in some reviews. it doesnt. i was more attracted to myself than anyone was. it smells awesome, and i'll continue to wear it till its gone because i enjoy the smell, but it was a total waste. and it was NOT packaged well, i lost like half the tiny little bottle in shipping, i was pretty pissed off."
1,"Non - effective, and a waste!","As a male (since its suggested that either gender can use it), I've used it at various Bars, Diners, Shopping malls, and at work for the past 4-months. Absolutely NO RESPONSE, NO POSITIVE FEEDBACK, NOTHING.Than I simply just bought a Chocolate-scented cologne for $25 that has NO PHEROMONES AT ALL, AND BINGO!!!At the bank, I got almost 50 people to look at me simutaneously, with the approval of ALL the female clerks, and even at bars where liquor is the dominant odor, people instantly go Mmmmmmm. All I'm saying is that their is some natural odors that people are just attracted to like; cook outs, chocolate, fresh loaf of bread, pizza and others."
4,mmmm it smells so good!!,"I first heard of this product at a tasteful treasures party. It was $25 from tasteful treasures. So the price is right on amazon! This stuff smells awful straight from the bottle, but put it on and give it a few minutes to mix with your natural scents, and its heaven in a bottle!!! It smells different on everyone, so if you dont like it on one person it may not mean that you dont like it on yourself or someone else. The only downfall i have for this is that the scent doesnt last as long as id like it to, but i will still keep loyal to this product, i love it!"
3,"Bottle leaks, but the contents are wonderous","The bottle leaks when it is not properly upright, and this is especially problematic because it needs to be shaken before each use.This is more of an effeminate perfume, rather than a masculine cologne, however it really would work for both. There is some reaction with sweat/skin so that it draws out pheromones, and smells entirely differently after half an hour."
3,The music wails.... but what about recording quality?,"This recording has definite earth-scortching potential, but the recording quality is merely average. I have owned the cassette for many years and it always sounds good thru the Sony boombox. I recently bought the CD for my home system, eager to crank ""Mas Y Mas"", I popped it in and WHAT THE &$^#%#@...VERY DISAPPOINTING... I have the ""Best band from East L.A."" on CD and it is MUCH MUCH better in recording quality.Still one of my favorite recordings."
4,Los Lobos has my respect...,"Tired of the WalMart hyped cookie cutter bands. Check out Los Lobos. They offer great variety and really shine when they rock n roll. This is a great band that is always worth listening too. Los Lobos is a true American classic band with great musicians. Music is first here, not the marketing Wal Mart scam we are so used to in this hemisphere."
2,Will do the job in the absence of alternatives,"Agree with the reviewer about ""pompous computer speak"", and that the real info could be presented in about 10 pages. I have far too many docs that I need to wade through. The published IEEE standards are always available if you're having insomnia. BUT, with some motivation to get through this book, I was able to accomplish my objective: get a feel for the HLA. [...] Next I'll try the Singhal/Zyda book that another reviewer suggested."
3,Benefits greatly from the absence of alternatives,"As other reviewers pointed out, the book is basically not a match for how complex the HLA and RTI are. Compare this for example with OpenGL where the complexity of the topic is equally matched with books that do cover it in depth. Despite its widespread use for sim, remains a poorly documented topic that people have to learn through trial and errors."
5,Acer A-OK!,"Simple plug and play. Easy to understand features, slim and attractive. WELL worth the money for the high-end pixel display and it well BELOW the cost of competitors of the same rating. Altogether, a great unit!"
4,handy jogging stroller,this stroller is very handy and folds up easily. very lightweight and easy to walk or jog with.
4,Better then nothing,I got this for my crazy ferrets.. the box itself is great though they broke that plastic clip that holds it to the cage in 5 min. I ended up going and getting some nuts and bolts and have it nice and secure now
3,Wouldn't fit in cage,"This litter pan was WAY too big for my cage. I was hoping this would make a great litter pan that my bunnies could get in and out of easily, but I didn't think it'd be that big, and I couldn't even fit it through the opening in my cage. Even if I could, it would've taken up too much room in there and would leave very little space for my precious bunnies to hop around. This is a great pan IF you plan on using as an out-of-cage pan,if you have an extremely large cage that will accommodate it, or if you have a large opening to your cage and don't mind it taking up so much space. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Puppy gift,I sent this as a puppy gift to a friend...so far the pup seems interested in it. I hope it will keep her from chewing her furniture.
5,Clearest translation amongst the 500 Bible translations.,"Having studied past Johannes Greber's two well known books, and read that recently the oldest available Greek manuscripts translate to the same words as are found in Grebers translation, there can be no doubt that it was inspired by God's angels (as we read in Hebrews 1:14). There is a comparative effort to provide for several translated sections from the ancient Greek which help the reader to understand how inaccuracies of translation occurred over the centuries, by a Professor Clint Tibbs (D.Rel), at his website: [...]."
4,Very good CD and MP3 player but not radio,I bought this product and it was very easy to install under kitchen cabinet with provided template. It comes with three CD changer and provision to attach external MP3 player. The sound quality is very good but when it comes to radio the quality is not that good that's the reason I'm giving 4 stars. It says in the manual though that you have to install this product away from refrigerator (In my case it is 3 ft that could be the reason). But otherwise love this product.
1,It never worked!,It never worked. Returned it to be replaced. Instead they gave me credit. It looked great when I opened the box.
4,Are the dimensions correct?,"I haven't bought this yet ... was close to one-click then noticed the dimensions say ""12 x 20 x 16"". Can anyone advise if this is correct? I have only 16"" between cabinet and counter so I am thinking this must be an error? I will check back on reviews in a few days then maybe I will one-click my self a new CD changer for the kitchen."
2,poor sound,"Present for my wife.She enjoys having it in the kitchen while she's working, mostly plays CD's on it. I can't stand the sound quality myself and usually turn it off and play the stereo (LG) in the next room if I'm home. I am a SONY fan, but the 16 year old Emerson shelf stereo in the garage sounds better than the speakers on this unit."
4,"GOOD SOUND, I LIKE THE AUX FEATURE FOR IPOD OR IPHONE. GREAT FOR THE KITCHEN.","GOOD SOUND FOR THE KITCHEN, AUX FEATURE IS GREAT. OVERALL ITS A GOOD BUY. MY ONLY COMPLANT IS THAT I CAN NOT GET MY WIRELESS SPEAKERS TO WORK WITH IT FOR WHEN I'M OUTSIDE."
1,Looking for good sound - look elsewhere,"Looks nice, tunes in the radio fine. But if you're looking for a good sounding system for the kitchen, keep looking - and good luck on that. Remember the old transister radios of yesteryear, well at least they had some treble. Muddy and flat sounding would be the word here. It looks good and the wife's happy but I'd like to throw it out the window every time I hear it. If you have an ear for music (which most people don't), do yourself a favor and don't torture yourself with this unit."
3,sony radio,"mediorce radio,sound is good.had the top off 3 times to free cd,s being stuck where it wont eject them.seems the xfmr hums also."
5,Sony Under Cabinet Radio,"Critical points for me in deciding which under cabinet radio to purchase were: station reception, sound quality, and manufacturer reputation. This radio rates ""excellent"" in all respects. The price, ease of installation, and appearance were all welcome bonuses. We live in a relatively remote rural area where ""shopping"" is difficult at best and any necessary product returns or service can be frustrating if not completely impossible. The reviews I read were very helpful and reliable. I am very pleased with my purchase! Thank you for the services Amazon provides!"
4,"Great, Especially for the Price!",I purchased this as a gift for my parents who's kitchen is spacially challenged. They live in an area that doesn't receive that great of radio reception to begin with so I did have some doubts that this would be powerful enough to bring in the signal clearly for them. Well I am happy to say that all stations come in crystal clear! The 3 CD changer and MP3 jack work wonderfully and the remote control that is magnetic is a plus too. The sound quality is great especially for the price. Highly recommended.
4,Strange Bedfellows,"William Libaw's PAINTING IN A WORLD TRANSFORMED is a remarkable read. Libaw explores science and art, strange bedfellows alternately existing side by side and then at odds with each other. My one complaint is that the text is so engrossing and thought provoking that the black and white illustrations do not do the prose justice."
1,ANIMAL SACRIFICES WITH NO WARNING,"What a messed up documentary. We get to see cows, goats, and chickens beheaded *with no warning*. Also, is the idiot documentary about the civil war or the little girls? Neither story line is well represented, much less blended together to form a nice flow."
1,If only she knew,"The family knew the truth of why and would not tell, that is why she stood alone. It took me 10 years to get up the nerve to confront my family with the lies and the truth. I am Pattys cousin from Augusta,GA. I tried to support her release 17 years ago but was threatened by a family member and even my own mother stopped talking to me for a year. She has since passed away and I am now ready to confront the demons in our family and tell the TRUTH. I was at Pattys last parole hearing and was refused to appear with her. I have talked to Frank DeLuca persannally and have corresponeded with him for 10 years. I know what happened. I will tell the truth in a book of my own. It will be nothing like you have heard before."
5,A beautiful jazz album that flows,"I've had this album for a long time, just listened to it again last night. I was amazed how the songs flow together and that every track on the album is memorable and listenable.Starting with the simple clean piano on ""Free Yourself"", with the percussion and bass flowing in, and ending with ""Angels on my Mind"", again clean piano chords and lead, with it's somewhat somber, somewhat hopeful tone, this album should be listened to straight through over and over.My favorites are ""Hippies on a Corner"" which always gets me moving (and has a great background story that Joe tells in concerts before he plays it; the refrain is great in this song) and ""Black and White"" with it's single note melody opening.Fantastic album, recommended for jazz fans, piano fans."
4,WoW,Good range and plenty loud.Would be 5 star if had better tones to play.A better value for this price will be hard to find.
2,Simply did not work as advertised,"Only one chime worked. No matter how hard we tried, only one would work at a time. We got one to work, and then the other, but never both. The range was terrible! The product was very cheaply constructed. We ended up returning it and buying one at the local hardware store, just getting two receivers and it worked like a charm. And cost about the same. I would have given 1 star except I got a full return on my money, so I gave them an extra star for that."
5,Great Value,Great for all weather conditions.Easy to use and install.Very loud anyone can hear it from any room.Nice variety of songs.
2,Great while it lasted,"We bought this doorbell set to use to page our kids while they were in the basement. It was great while it worked. It only worked about two months then it started being really sporadic. Now it doesn't work at all. We have changed the batteries numerous times, thinking they were dead or that they wouldn't work with rechargeables. They still dont work. What a waste."
4,Good not Great,"Got this for my invalid mother to use as a call button. Pushing the button does not always cause the chimes to go off. Would have liked a volume control on the chimeand would have liked the light to stay on for a couple minutes after the chime goes off (or say on until reset). All in all for the price, B."
3,NOT BAD FOR A FIRST DEMO SESSION!,"The lineup for this release is the same as the first 3 Santana releases on Columbia, and these are indeed demo studio sessions recorded in 1969. By far what we have here are mostly instrumental jams of a young band trying out their chops (only two songs have lyrics). They are neither as polished or powerful as they would soon become, but you can see the style and potential here. So if you are into 1960's San Francisco-Style Acid Rock Jams, this is a great album.The sound quality of all but the last 3 songs is pretty good and clear for the period. For some reason the last 3 songs sound like out of a bootleg. But you still get a solid 90 minutes of good jamming!"
1,Flat out doesn't work,"It doesn't support Secure Sockets Layer, which is required for my ISP. They don't tell you that before buying. I wasted hours, working this out for myself, contacting tech support, and after I explained to them what the problem was, they found it in their knowledge base. ""Based on the information you gave us the problem is that SpamKiller doesn't support SSL. Is there anything I can help you with?"" ""Yeah, how about a refund?"" Nope, that is a different department. So, non-functional product (with my ISP, at least.) And they weren't very appologetic, or quick with the refund. And the address that the tech gave me for sending feedback doesn't function either."
1,What kind of spamfilter is this?,"I recently installed Mcafee Spamkiller, which came with the Internet Security Suite. Upon configuration, it gave me messages asking to change my username to my full e-mail address, and incoming server to 'localhost'. Upon bootup, it said it was not protecting my computer. It did not filter but a few emails. I had to uninstall and reinstall and put my full email address as the username and 'localhost' as the incoming server during the 2nd setup and it STILL corrected me, and didnt filter anything. Its bad enough that there are corrupt spammers out there, but I dont need to be cheated by a company that is supposed to be protecting me. And the designers dont care. They just want $$$$"
3,Works If You're Willing To Be Patient,I recently downloaded the 30 day trial from McAfee for SpamKiller. I had a few minor problems in the beginning getting my email list set up so I wasn't filtering out family and friends. After reading the online help and following the directions (I use XP and full blown Outlook) I was able to filter out spam quite effectively. I have had no problems with the SpamKiller locking up my system or keeping me from getting email. I can understand the frustrations some previous posters have had but I have not had any major problems.I would recommend this product for most people but please remember you may need to be patient when installing and setting it up for the first time
1,Forget Any Support,"The actual software isn't all that bad, it manages to get about 20% of the SPAM - it is easily spoofed by even the the casual spammer. It does however, really seem to like letters from folks I want mail from (like relatives). It puts those in the kill box at the drop of a hat. Fortunately you can still rescue them.The worst part is the lack of support, unless you want to pay $2.95 a minute. Can you spell ""Chislers""? Take my advice stick with Symantec products or Zone Alarm."
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could.,"After three installs and uninstalls of this program, I've had it. Spam still gets thru, Outlook locks-up, same problems over and over. SpamKiller should be put to sleep."
2,Nautica Wallet,"Hated this wallet, never used it. It is my fault for not checking the dimensions, but this thing is huge."
5,A Pleasant Suprise,I got this as a birthday present for myself and was surprised by all the room in it for my cards and even a pocket for my change and the fact that it zips up. Definitely an upgrade from my previous wallets.
1,Does not work!,Product was sent out right away but the print cartridge does not fit in the carrier and now the print does not recognize any print cartridge. I can no longer use the printer! I would not buy this product it is not a compatible print cartridge!!!
2,Sins of Omission,"A nice idea, fairly well executed, but with inexcusable omissions. A book about 70s metal (or proto-metal) and no mention of Dark?! Perhaps even more conspicuous is the absence of any mention of Wishbone Ash, who pioneered the 'harmony guitar' style that Iron Maiden built a career on.Also, there are bands on the accompanying CD that do not have entries in the actual book. Was this a mistake? And about the CD...why are there bands included on the CD that are given mediocre to poor ratings by Popoff in the book itself?"
2,Not for serious chewers,I purchased this for my puppy who was six months old at the time and weighed about 30 lbs then. She pulled out the rope and then completely destroyed it. She hasn't touched the kong part since. Not real motivating for a chewer.
1,"They have taken the word ""gullible"" out of the dictionary....","Err... how dimwitted are you? He made it up. He admits he made it up. When asked about his sources (on, for example the monkey washing thing) he said"" Oh, well, I dont have any actual sources, but this is what might have happened""!Fraud. Flimflam. Wrong. Incorrect. Gellerism. Made-up. Barnumism. Joke. Hoax. Hoakum. etc etc."
5,NCIS!! The Best Entertainment Connection With T.V. Viewers Nationwide!,"I don't believe there'll be any television show that can match that special NCIS magic, its great cast of actor(s), writers, directors and all of the behind the scenes staff that makes NCIS the show what it has become today."
3,Nice cream but did not do the job.,My feet do not smell but they do perspire heavily. I change my socks at least 3 times a day and they are always wet. My foot doctor recommended this product. Have used more then half the bottle and I do not see a difference at all. I will use it all up as it is a nice cream to keep my feet soft but they still do sweat.
5,great,"I pay 100 bucks for this at the store, here is cheaper DO'...it has great sound for movies and music , great bass . and is not too big...good for small rooms ."
5,Amazing Speakers at an Amazing Price,"This is the first set of speakers that I have purchased for my Macbook Pro, and they are great! All of the reviews are dead on. I received these speakers today and was egar to use them. The quality is unmatched in this price range and could even out perform $100+ speakers. Controller is a big plus and build quailty is soild. Sub has some weight to it, but nothing unexpected. I am overall very happy with this product and would recommend to anyone looking to purchase a 2.1 sound system."
3,Convenient But So-So Sound,"I bought my Z-4 system to replace an older Altec 2.1 system that lacked a volume control and headphone jack. The Altec was less expensive, but its sound was significantly better.The Z-4 system has a muffled mid-range, poor transient response, and relatively high subwoofer distortion. Subwoofer position makes a significant difference in perceived bass response. Imaging is average, with a limited sound stage. To be sure, the Z-4 beats any 2.0 system I've heard, but even with a high quality sound card and graphic equalizer, I am unable to make it sound ""right.""If you don't have high expectations for sound quality, you will appreciate the unit's attractive satellites, good fit and finish, easy hook-up, and convenient control module. If your primary objective is good sound, though, the Z-4 is probably not for you."
4,Good output for home computer,"I purchased this about 2 years ago and it is working great. Good output for a home computer--I can't stand pathetic speakers when listening to music. The only negative is the corded remote--I wish it was either wireless or on the speakers themselves. I believe this is a good product, with no problems two years later, for a good price."
5,These speakers are great!,"I bought these speakers for my fiance, and he really enjoys them. They work great; all features work as advertised."
3,Not very pretty,"These boxes did not meet my expectations. And they are smaller than I expected. I will not use them for gifts as they do not look good enough. I will put my own jewelry in them for storage. They were not expensive, but they also were not particularly good value. Would not recommend if you are looking for a replacement for the boxes that jewelry comes in. These look cheaper, not better, than the usual Amazon packaging."
4,nice,they are nice and i thought they could be a bit bigger but they could hold at least one pair of earrings per one
1,the plastic to protect the tattoos ripped off the ink,"i bought this only as a filler item but one would think after only getting 12 temp tats, it was ok. well i peeled off the plastic that ""protects"" the temp tats and it ripped all the design off so i only have 2 temp tats to even use. not sure how they store this item but it got too hot and melded to the plastic at some point. no worth it."
5,The Queen of Country,"I am impressed with the ""20th Century Masters"" series of Country Music, and this is a real fine collection of the purest voice of country music. Sure, there were many other songs which could've been included here, but this is a fine sampling; and they are well mixed. I have had the good fortune of hearing many of Kitty's albums on their original LP's while growing up, and the clear sound of the CD actually surprised me. While the album obviously covers Kitty's response to Hank Thompson with ""It Wasn't God...."", the two finest tracks here are ""Searching"" and ""Heartbreak USA"". I would love to see many of her original LP's rereleased on disc; Lord knows we need it with today's offering coming out of Nashville. Buy the disc (and dont be afraid to purchase others in this 20th Century Masters series...they are good). After watching CMT and GAC, it's refreshing to harken back to the days when ladies had real class."
5,Beautiful,I bought these earrings as a graduation gift for my daughter from college. They are beautiful. The size is perfect and the color is wonderful. She was thrilled with them. Both of us would highly recommend these earrings to anyone.
4,this money clip is a good choice :),"I bought the black version of this money clip for my boyfriend's birthday, and this is what he had to say about it:""The money clip is really compact and nice. It holds my cards well. I think only a card slot would make it better.""Overall, I think it makes a really handy gift. It will definitely be used.It's very small, holds cards very tightly, and comes in handy whenever you need to cut things.I was torn between getting the black one and the silver one. I don't know what the silver one looks like, but the black one is definitely pretty, in my opinion. It goes with everything and has a very simple design."
1,A book too general even for beginner,"I have just finished the book and found that this book is toogeneral even for beginners. The author keep repeating thesame concept throughout the book. Though there are manyexercises offered in the book, they are just slightmodifications and replicates of the earlier exercises.For those who would like to learn more about intuition, Istrongly recommend the book ""Divine Intuition"" by Lynn A. Robinson."
1,poor service and poor quality,"Buyer beware must be Pacific Digital's mantra. The USB 2.0 dvd burner I bought from them died in under six months. The burner, a lite-on, was fine it was their enclosure that failed. Their customer service was horrendous as was the shipping that I was forced to pay to receive replacement parts, which still have not arrived. If you are looking for a product that will give you reliable service and lasting performance STAY AWAY from pacific digital!!!!"
2,Weak effort that never really grabbed me.,"Although the production quality is great, and the individual songs pleasant; overall I found this cd uninspiring and, frankly, boring. Cher's effort seems lacking spirit and the work as a whole is missing something."
1,US album is bad but UK album is the BEST,Listen carefully people try to compare these 2 CD's for yourself before you buy it!!! This CD is a US verison and the other one just like this one was made the UK verison and UK verison only has more songs than this one and it's worth it and it has GREAT songs in it than this one. US verison is not too good but check it out for yourself and see which is worth it!! Please try to check the UK verison!!
3,Buy the far superior British import,"The folks at Warner Bros. here in the U.S. decided to doctor several of the original tracks on this, Cher's finest recording since 1975's Stars. In doing so, with cheesy synth beats, a beautifully produced and sung homage to male songwriters sounds cheap. By trying to bring the sound of It's a Man's World up to the minute, the geniuses involved forgot that the minute would pass before the CD was even released. The British import is the one to own. With three additional tracks, it's the whole album, with the original, and in all cases far superior, versions of five tracks."
4,Managing Organizational Change,"The book has some spelling and grammer errors, but I needed it for a class textbook, so I guess it's fulfilling its purpose."
1,Run in the mouth professors,"Read like someone was trying to feel important. Lots of information, thought."
1,capture NIGHTMARE,"Everytime my source video has a scene change the capture hardware hangs, producing a stuttering image of the last frame sucessfully captured. The MovieBox manual says that during video ""dropouts"" the MovieBox ""will wait for an interference free signal"" and that this ""can take a few momements"" to acquire the new signal. It suggests that the unit be reset or power cycled if it does not properly reacquire the signal after it has stabilized. Since this issue occurs at every scene change you will need to babysit your capture so you can reset your hardware and restart the capture each time you turned off your camcorder during the original recording. The included software is good, but the hardware is fatally flawed - and the manufacturer is trying to sell it anyhow!"
4,Great hold,"I use this for affixing items to my metal building walls, as well as decals to vehicles. The stuff is very strong (I have an eye wash first aid kit held up with it). The metal building walls see all kinds of temperature extremes, and this stuff still sticks."
5,plank making,this bottle and roller work great. For a while i was making my own planks and it this roller spread out the glue in an even manner.
2,Not good on hardwood floors,"My mother bought this toy for my nine-month-old daughter, who's been pulling herself up to stand for a little over a month using furniture in our home. While she enjoys the lights and the dancing bear, she quickly gets bored of the toy (as she does most toys, except for her electric drum set.) The biggest concern with this toy is that is not very sturdy for a baby to hold onto as they pull themselves up. My daughter can pull herself up on it, but have to hold one side down for her to be able to without the toy tipping. It slides easily on our floors, which are all hardwoods. This may not be a problem on carpeted floors, but it has little weight to it's base making it easy to topple over."
2,Not very interesting for my granddaughter,I purchased it for my granddaughters first birthday. She might have enjoyed it more if I had purchased it a month or so earlier. It is a sturdy toy but I wish I would have purchased a non-electronic toy.
4,Entertaining Toy,"My twin girls love this toy. I bought it for them when they first learning to stand and really liked that we could adjust the height so that they could hold on it and learn to pull up. Once they were really pulling up we raised it and they use it to cruise. They love, love, love the microphone on it and laugh at each other ""talking"" into it. I think they will continue to enjoy this toy in the future as they start to learn the songs and to dance along with them. My only complaint is that the top rotates about a quarter turn and can be a little unstable when they are holding on."
2,didn't last a year,"This is a cute toy. I bought this for my daughter last Christmas. She enjoyed playing with it and dancing to the music. My only complaint is that it broke today, so it didn't last a year."
1,Unsafe for hardwood floors,"Like what the other customer said, this toy is unsafe when you have hardwood floors. It is very light and slips as your baby steps on the platform itself. There is no grip at the bottom or whatsoever that will hold the toy and prevent it from slipping on the floor. I was surprised there was no recall on this toy, yet. You may not have a problem when you have carpeted floor. But with hardwood, I do not recommend buying it. Vtech sit to stand walker is better. Nothing special on the bear either, it just rotates. And take note also that once the bear has been installed, it cannot be removed."
3,Low key; regular,"I was looking forward to more action and more extreme sex among the characters, as in the 1st season, but the third season seem more of a wind down, and quite superficial!"
1,"Great Series, But NO Closed Captions","First season have no subtitles and no closed captions. I don't understand why the only second season is subtitled. I am deaf, I want to be filled in with information with the movie. I enjoyed the movie a lot. I just don't understand why I can't see first and third seasons with CC or subtitles. Didn't make a lot of sense."
5,Two Viewpoints Equally Valid,"An absolutely delightful romp through biology and literature tying the two together in ways never attempted before. The basic premise is genetic portraying Man as a package for a genetic code. This is applied to literature in a very interesting way. Or, it could be looked upon as just the opposite with literary examples to illustrate biological points. All in all, completely delightful. Highly recommended."
5,Awesome story well told,"I just finished reading Camel Red last night. It was fantastic! When I started the book, I expected the story to be factual and interesting - but what I didn't expect is how well the author captured the spirit of what Larry and his wife, and the country for that matter went through, which to me is what the story is really about. What an incredible accomplishment. I highly recommend this book."
5,It was a gift...,"Gave it as a gift and will return to review if it does not perform. I inspected it and it seemed to be of good quality. Storage case for blades a definite plus so you do not have to go searching in ""that"" drawer and possibly cutting yourself. I would like to see it redesigned to have all the blades and parts snap together for storage in one piece. Nice touch with folding stand....I would recommend this product to others."
5,Ayuda a que tus hijos coman vegetales,"Este tipo de mandolina es magnifica para usarla todos los dias, los niños te lo agradeceran ya que puedes incorporar comidas mas vistosas para ellos que antes no les agradaban. puedes hacer figuras con vegetales y quesos y te aseguro que solo de verlas se las comeran."
2,OUTSTANDING...... for one day,"Rear speakers worked for one day. Sounded outstanding for one day.Everything powers on, the sub woofer, front speakers and center but the rear ones won't fire no matter how many times I push the pin in the holes on both the console and speakers. Nothing. The front ones and the woofer put out great sound but would liked to have the surround effect. S.O.L. with these speakers. They make great Mouse's and Trackballs but pass on these speakers. I'm not the only one, check the forums on Logitech's site."
2,Not worth it!,Nice packaging but dissapointing. For 100-200 bucks maybe but $350 is way too much for this system. The rear speakers have to be connected to an outlet so the wireless aspect is useless unless you have outlets where you want the rear speakers. Logitech is an excellent company but speakers may just not be their nitch.
2,"Great, if you have nothing wireless.","This is a fantastic system, if you have nothing else that is wireless. I have the G7 laser mouse from Logitech, which I cannot use at the same time the speakers are on because of interference, and also it completely destroys your wifi, also your cordless phones (if they are 2.4 ghz) are useless, my xbox 360 controllers can't be used when the speakers are on. It's so frustrating.So if you're thinking about buying this system, and you have a bunch of wireless stuff (phones, mouse, keyboard, game controllers, router, whatever) don't do it, 2.4 ghz is oversaturated, and the z-5450 seems to interfere on ALL 2.4ghz signals."
5,God will bless us if we bless Israel (Gen 12),I wear this pin often to send this subtle message. People often ask about it and that gives me an opportunity to preach the gospel. Great convo starter.
1,Software doesn't capture well on PC or laptop,"I am unable to capture a non-jerky, perfect video to disk transfer no matter how I try to speed up my computer. The direct-to-disk wizard won't produce anything at all and the best I can get out of it is a jerky movie with audio after a 4-8 hour process of capturing and making it into a movie. I feel I was misled by the software as the reality is it can only be used properly on extremely fast computers. Shame on Pinnacle! Shame on Future Shop (where I bought it)! I guess the lesson in this is to thoroughly research not only the technical requirements but the forums too before buying."
2,Not worth it,"I read many historical and theological books. This book lacks organization and it lacks any academic references. The vast majority of historical and/or theological books include bibliographies and footnotes or endnotes. This book had none of these. Further, as the book is an accumulation of essays and excerpts from many other sources, I would expect a bit of an explanation for each of the authors - especially the more obscure ones.Now, that being said, I do agree with much of what this book purports, and have read other books that touch on many of the items addressed by this book. However, I think this book is incomplete, and is not representative of the genre nor does it live up to its title."
4,Important Book!,"This book contains essays from some of the world's great thinkers regarding religion. It should be read by everyone. The naysayers are evidently vested in religion, which makes their reviews highly biased.Particuarly of interest in this book are the essays concerning the validity of the Bible - questioning the Bible definitely upsets some people, but it is absolutely necessary in this Age of Truth."
4,Study and Show yourself approved,"I loaned this book to an extremely ""pious"" adventist girl who always used to invite me to church and bible studies. I haven't heard any ""soul winning"" efforts from her since!"
2,Sigh,"If you are silly enough to think that ""faith is irrational"" (try some Plantinga) or that a television evangelist represents the cores of a 2000 year old religion. . . or that it is still bold and daring (!) to be critical of the church. . . this book is for you. It is badly argued. . . full of historical errors. . . and useful for knowing what the fringe ""skeptic"" community believes. Our church would love to do a study on this book with its young people . . . but it be unfair to thoughtful atheism. It is not nice to destory straw men."
5,The Book does a wonderful job at challenging Bible Inerrancy,"The Book is an excellent textbook for freethinkers. It shows that the Bible is indeed fallible. While some people may have a problem with this elicitation, I believe that it has heightened my personal religious experience. Religion and ill-founded faith are not what's important; reason and research in one's religion, however, help excite one's religious experience. In my case, I still believe in God and consider myself a freethinker. The Book has heightened my religious experience because I want to learn more. Truly, The Book has presented a thirst for knowledge of my religion that I never would have experienced without it"
1,"LIES, LIES, LIES YEA","I picked up this book as a work to refute New Testament accounts. I found mostly half truths and out and out lies. The history of Krishna being crucified (P185) is laughable and not factual. In fact I found a lot of opininon and quotes strung together that on the surface sound reliable, and compelling; but, given time even a grade school child could find the holes in Leedom's compilation of nonsense. While the list of contributor's sounds excellent, I find it noteworthy that ""The Book"" contains no bibliography or works cited list. Whereas Lee Strobel's book The Case for Christ has six and one half pages of references used for his book, authored by those on both pro and con sides of Christianity. This book is hardly worth the effort or time, save your money."
2,Holy typos! Editor please!,"Ok, I was raised VERY fundamentalist but I'm an agnostic verging on atheist and grabbed this book as something to help fuel debates with believers. It is ok in that it presents alot of different ideas, but it has very little depth to any of them. And for god's sake, if you are going to refute christian theory with any legitimacy ya might not want to have typos all over the place!"
2,Mostly Vitriolic Excrement,"""The Book Your Church Doesn't Want You to Read"" contains a handful of insightful, informative essays set against a backdrop of vitriolic excrement of questionable academic merit. Filler-pages account for nearly half the book, while the essays themselves are ""organized"" in a very haphazard fashion, completely lacking in any semblance of continuity (even for an essay compilation). Photos and illustrations are of cheap, black-and-white photocopy quality, and most are of little to no interest or relevance. In short, don't waste your money (even if you're an atheist such as myself)."
1,Not the original songs,"When I purchased this I didn't realize that the songs weren't sung by the original artists. Maybe it says that somewhere, but it wasn't clearly communicated. They are covers of famous country songs and not very good ones at that. There is no point in buying this CD unless maybe you know someone who sang on it."
4,Logitech powered speaker,"The speakers sound very good even at high volumes. This is a very good addition to mp3 players. I use it connected to my pocket pc to listen to internet radio stations and podcasts.There is a significant ""wow"" factor with the design.One caution however, there is no volume control on the speaker. The volume must be controlled at the source which can be inconvenient at times."
5,They're a steal,"Great sound for the size, unbeatable price, well designed, AC/DC operation. Wonderful. You can't go wrong."
3,sound quality doesn't meet my expectation,"It might be my overly high expectation or that the item I received is somehow defective, but the sound quality is not as good as what other reviews suggested. The sound lacks bass and is a bit metalic. It's acceptable when the volume is below half of the range and the distortion becomes apparent otherwise. I think it's still decently sounded for portable speakers under $20. But if you don't move it around a lot or rely on battery power, like how I intended to use it (I bought it to use as bed-side speakers), I suggest you to get a set of non-portable speakers. Almost any 3-piece computer speakers at similar price would beat this one easily in sound quality. I'll still keep these speakers, but will only use them when I go on trips."
3,"Decent sound, nice portability, cheap","You can't go wrong for $20.00. It fits in my laptop case nicely. It's a little obtrusive, but not terrible The cord is crazy crazy short and severely handicaps placement options when used with a laptop. The cord is like only 10 inches long and the speakers are 10"" wide... therein lies the problem. But they sound pretty good. I enjoy watching movies and TV on my laptop much much more, and it's fun to be able to play music annywhere I want to easily and with decent quality."
2,not so great,"I got these speakers as a gift. I am not sure i would have chosen them myself for the usage i was planning for. I wanted speakers for portable ipod play. These worked alright, they sound good if you are in front of them, otherwise they are just a bit above average. But as a gift, i didn't have any major complaints on the quality and i know the gift giver (my dad) did his homework on best bang for your buck on these. Perhaps i just got a faulty device, although from the low-star reviews here, it sounds like i had very common problems.I had a problem similar to many other reviewers, the device turned itself every few minutes, which was really annoying and kind of defeated the purpose. I was using it with the power supply so i don't see why this was happening. Then what's worse, i moved and my power supplies got mixed up so i accidentally used the wrong one and blew the speakers i guess. They have never turned on since. What a waste."
2,Disappointed,"I should have paid attention to reviews that mentioned the ""short cord."" I know this is an inexpensive speaker system but couldn't they put more than 12 inches on the cord between the speakers and my laptop?The sound was okay but after I unplugged it from my laptop, I had to shutdown and reboot. Not convenient.The good thing about the experience is that I could return it easily to [...]."
3,So So Film Noir,"Story about a women,Laura Mansfield(Joyce McKenzie)who sees her father murdered,a small time wise guy.The murderer,a punk,named Jackie(Stanley Clements).A local mobster(Hurd Hatfield)and a higher up known as Armitage(Albert Dekker)Laura find are the ones responsible for her fathers killing.Lots of wheeling and dealing and double crossing follow,not to mention a secret letter."
4,Eventually satisfactually,"Having acquired a taste for the Replacements only in their later days (Don't Tell A Soul and All Shook Down)in which their songs were better written and better played and better produced, I like tremendously Eventually (and 14 Songs). Eventually follows the more mellow/musical leanings of the two previously mentioned Rep.'s cd's. Still guitar driven, but better sounding guitar driven. This is the music of a maturing songwriter/musician that puts together catchy,yet rough edged, songs. There are some rough songs here (like You've had it with you) but the trend is towards more mellow songcraft, and it works.....Eventually you will return to this cd time and again."
3,Absolutely terrible film... it's great!,"Mostly I bought this for its historical value. Nooo, not because it has any relationship to actual history. Nope, I got it just because I'm the guard who gets his heart torn out by the evil wizard in the first two minutes of the film. It's taken me more than 20 years to find a copy of this movie (not that I've been looking all that hard). Beyond that, this is classic 80's late night cheesy movie. I just wish MST3K was still around to lampoon it. Oh well."
1,GARBAGE,"Cheep fast shipment. Cables seemed to be good quality. BNC connectors seemed to be quality. Cables were very positional, kept loosing picture. DO NOT PURCHASE. These cabels are not worth any cheep price. Had them connected to a fixed, non mobile DVR. COULD NOT MAINTAIN A PICTURE. My other longer cables worked just fine. These are GARBAGE!"
2,I've read worse.,"This was a pretty good story, but it was just that- a story. I had a hard time believing what was going on. I'm certainly not a member of the medical profession, but I felt like quite a lot of the jargon was a bit beneath my reading level. I also felt that the general twists of the plot were beneath my reading level as well. It could have been a bit more suspenseful. While I appreciated the author not droning on with too much useless character development, I wish he'd have developed a secondary character (Maria) sooner than 3/4 of the way through the book.I also found a serious plot flaw. I won't go into it because if you read the book and don't notice it, the book will be much more enjoyable. However, it is the main reason I'm giving this a 2 star rating. I thought the flaw was insulting to the reader."
3,Worth the price,I bought this clock radio because i hate to start my day with a blarring buzzer alarm. Although its voice quality could have been better i still like it for what it is. Some of my friends complained that the wake up music will put you to further sleep. For a light sleeper like me this kind of soft sound is enough to wake me up and anyway it has normal buzzer as well but may be not that loud.Most of nature tracks are decent.The projection on the wall is good as well.Radio could be better.Overall it is a good product but definitely has scope of improvements.
2,Second unit failed too,My first clock worked great until an annoying buzzing began one night. The buzzing would go off and on waking me from sleep. I replaced the first one and was happy until six months later when it began buzzing again. I tossed it out.
2,Not so hot,"This was originally bought for my 3 month old (at the time) for white noise when he takes naps. In the beginning, this was a great buy, the sound quality was very good, no complaints. Now less than a year later, the radio has stopped working altogether. No reason, just dont work. Will not light up or anything. So I did give it 2 stars because when it worked, it was awesome. But now it dont work at all, so I would be cautious of buying it."
2,Projection is too bright,"I was so excited to get this clock primarily for the projection feature. It certainly does its job, but the glare from the projection is way too bright. It makes the entire room have a blue glow at night -- equivalent to a TV. And the alarm isn't reliable. We check the station, time and volume every night before we go to sleep, and still there are mornings it does not wake us up. I'm sure that is due to our own error in hitting the snooze or something, but we've never had a problem with a clock radio getting turned down so easily. The nature sounds are the only redeemable feature on this product. We are definitely getting another clock."
1,No display after just 2 weeks,"The features of this unit are great....however, the quality is questionable. After using the product for 2 weeks, the display went out so all that was shown was a number ""5"". After unplugging the unit, then turning the unit off and on a few times, the display came back. The next day, I set my alarm and went to bed. I woke up before alarm time and noticed the display again had one number. It was an hour before I was due to get up so I spent 15 minutes trying to troubleshoot the unit but no dice, no display.Clearly, this is a defective unit and was Made in China so perhaps the materials used were sub-par. If you decide to order this, be sure to keep your box and receipt for awhile to make sure you don't get a lemon like I did. By the way, I agree with the reviewer who said the radio was not strong - difficult to get a decent signal."
4,Overall good product,I like the nature sounds. The projection is too bright but otherwise it's a very good product.
1,dreadful product; dreadful company,"After another model HoMedics soundspa would not work, I exchanged for this model, and lo, this one was also dysfunctional. The buttons on top (to select the soundtracks) did not function, and setting the various features of the clock were tremendously complex (and I have a PhD!). Not sure I ever got the automatic clock settings working right, even once set. So I recommend do not buy this product.Note that as gifts I have received several other HoMedics products (foot spa, office chair massager pad, handheld vibrational massage unit)--ALL were either poor in function and broken within a few days to a few months. I am a light user of such products--HoMedics products are just of VERY LOW quality. Save yourself the heartache and money: don't buy anything from HoMedics."
2,Less then relaxing,The past few nights I have turned on the soft relaxing sounds to fall asleep I am abruptly woken up by a sounds of a radio wave interruption. It is so loud that it makes me sit up in bed. I have no electronics in my bedroom to cause this interruption.
5,overhead clock = homedco clock/radio,We received this item in A-1 condition. It has proven to be all that it was advertised. Thank you.
3,Ceiling Projection Too Bright,"I gave 3 stars because it was a pretty neat clock with all its features. However, I returned this clock because I felt like I had a street light in my room at night. The ceiling projection was way too bright for me and the focus didn't work very well. I had another projection clock (by Sharp, I'm bummed because I can't locate it to buy another)which was perfect - subtle in projection brightness but still very clear and easy to see at night. Great clock if the projection brightness won't bother you."
3,HO HUM MEDICS sound clock,"Not a bad item but the sounds are mundane at bestThe clock keeps time, alarm works, etc.For the money I thought it would be a lot better."
4,Pretty cool,"I bought this clock recently and I must say, I am impressed. Sound quality is superb, radio clarity is superb, projection is nice, form factor is cool...Only if they have multiple alarms !!!"
4,Great product!,"Great for tweens and teenagers that don't want the light on at 6am on school days!!! You can simply say - look at the time! Also, smoothing sounds that put them early to bed."
2,Wish I would have gone for the more expensive white noise unit.,"The HoMedics SS-4000 Sound Spa Clock Radio w/ Relaxation Sound Machine is not the product to get if you are looking for a sustained white noise sound to lull you to sleep. It is cheap, tinny, and just kind of hokey with bird sounds, and the digital clock that is reflected on the ceiling. My own fault, what did I think I would get for $29.00? I tried to use it once and it was so irritating, I had to turn it off. It will be a good item for the next white elephant party, or a garage sale item. Well... you asked."
1,Stopped working,"I was really excited to get this sound spa for my baby's room. It worked for about a month. Now when I turn it on, the white noise stays on for a couple of hours and then turns itself off. The timer is not on, so I know it is not something that I did to cause this. I'm returning it and buying a different brand."
1,"Bad quality control, and overall crappiness","i bought this alarm a few days ago based on the many positive reviews it's gotten here. boy was i wrong.first off the controls are not thought out well, and after you've set the alarm, it's impossible to double check when it's set for without either turning off the alarm or changing the alarm time.second, the sound quality of the nature noises that play on this thing to wake you up is pure garbage. i'd rather wake up to my old beeping alarm clock than the ""soothing"" noises they have pre-programmed in this thing.and the last problem i had with this really took the cake. one day after i bought this and set it up, one of the digit displays broke. so instead of showing 12:00 it'd appear as 1 :00. I didn't do anything to it, it was just sitting on my dresser, when all of a sudden it broke. Talk about poor craftsmanship. this thing is totally not worth your time, STAY AWAY."
2,Kindergartenpopmusic,"Aaron Carter is famous because he is the brother of Backstreet Boy Nick. That's the only reason. He can't sing, he can't rap, he can't dnce what he proves with this song. You can't even hear his voice. All you hear are the backgroundsingers.I know that this Single is five years old but his voice didn't get better over the years. He really should stop singing."
5,"Kicking style,just like BSB.","When I first got the CD I got because it was Nick's younger brother's album so I had to see what it was about. I brought it home and I could hardly wait to listen to it. As I was listening I could picture him doing exactly what he said with me. That's the same way I feel about Backstreet Boys. If you think it's for teeny boppers than listen again, I'm 16 and love it."
1,Kids under sixteen shouldn't sing.,My God he hasn't even gone threw......GAG... They'll let anyone sang nowadays. Gave them 1 star cause they made me...BURP!
1,Wrong Information.,"Just from the first description/review, one would get the impression that this is the actual A&E; 10-part series which aired in 1981.....which was probably one of the best historical dramas they have ever done. It was spellbinding and Adolfo Celi made Rodrigo Borgia COME ALIVE with his amazing portrayal of that Spanish Pope.Future seekers of the original ""THE BORGIAS"" - an A&E; 1981 10-part series should know this before they mistakenly purchase something that will surely be a disappointment.ThanksClaude King"
1,Amazon sent incorrect part,"I urge everyone to double check their packages, I have ordered the correct part but amazon sent me another water pump, Amazon sent me this one instead.[...]"
5,Guitar Wolf's BEST album!!,"Not easy to find in shops but i got this from Japan via the internet. Run Wolf Run is super raw!! and i love it! my personal favourite song is the instrumental ""El Toro"" i simply can't play it enough - Japanese Royalty , 9/10"
1,VERY disapointed,"Nothing new here. Same ole same ole...It was very long and there is NO Queen music at all! Couldn't even sit through the whole thing. While the people are talking the music in the background is too loud and, again, NOT even Queen.....Go with ""We are the Champions"" instead."
3,Very basic text,"This book, it should be emphasized, is ideal for someone who has had about 2 years of French at the U.S. high-school level (or about 2 semesters at university). The vocabulary is very basic. The more advanced student might consider looking elsewhere, in my opinion. This book is a good collection of the absolute essentials of ""survival"" French, but not much beyond that."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book because the German version is so good. The German version gives a complete, useful sentence for almost every German word in the book. It is so good (5+ stars) that I bought the French version sight-unseen. What a disappointment! It's mostly just word lists, some with a short phrase, very few with even a simple complete sentence. Moderately useful, but very far from what it could be. The German version sets a much higher standard."
3,Vocabulary by Catergory,"I was hoping for a book with a great deal of vocabulary in a reading-friendly format. This book is really just lists of vocabulary sorted by catergory to be used as a reference guide, rather than a vocab builder. If that's what you want, it provides a good volume of words and phrases."
4,Nice Shelves,"I purchased two of these shelves for my entry way hallway. They were easy to assemble, I did them both my self in about and hour. They are very sturdy, and look great. The only thing wrong, ( my fault only though ) was they were shorter than I thought they would be. I was hoping for something taller, since my entryway is tall, but I improvised and used some mirrors. All in all, they are great for the money, very sturdy, and a great piece of furniture."
2,it was ok except the recommended attack team pics were messy,"the suggested attack team formation screen pictures in the book were sometimes and quite often messed up, what i mean is, the suggested formation on one screen would either be the same for the following battle, or tell you the next battle would split your party when the game dosen't. There are also plenty of grammatical errors."
5,transformer bike,"This bike is great, and was easy to assemble. I bought it for my Four year old who is just big enough to start to ride it come summer."
5,Awesome bike,My son loves this bike. He loves Transformers and thisbike cost a little more than I wanted to spend but it isworth every dollar. It was pretty easy to assemble and myson has been riding it everyday since he got it and no problems.It is the best gift we got him for his birthday!
4,Good bike but...,After chunking some cheaper bikes I noticed one bike made by Kent lasted over three years of heat and rain. This is one sweet looking bike and under all the frills is one tough looking bike. One thing is it is heavy and so it is slower than other bikes we own.
3,Not bad but not good either,"My 3 year old son loves this bike - Mainly because it's his first bike and it has Optimus Prime on it. That's the good part.The bad part - this bike is cheap. Some parts broke before my son even rode it. I took them off and he never knew.So, for learners this bike is ok, but if your kid rides a lot get something better."
5,Introduce your children to REAL history,"DK eyewitness books are some of the greatest non-fiction books around. The distinctive white background and high-quality photography gives this book an edge over any other nonfiction picture book. And -- these pictures are real! They're beautiful museum-quality photos of all things related to ancient Rome, accompanied by informative captions and text.Learn about life in Rome, the slaves and emperors who lived there, and SEE the objects they used everyday. If you know someone (young or old) who is fascinated by ancient Rome, then you must introduce them to this book!"
3,ouch icepicks in my ears,"The original version of these speakers are said to be legendary. Too bad the reissues are not. Although apparently made to original specs, the reissues have okay clean sounds and they break up nice and early but they cannot handle much power or distortion. It has a thin and fizzy sound. They might get better with age but why bother the wait?"
1,does more harm then good,"I have been to many massage therapists, acupuncturists, and physicians about my back and neck pain, so when my boyfriend saw this mat he thought it would be an ideal Christmas present. All the mat does is vibrate and does not actually kneed or massage. All the vibration caused my muscles to tense and I had a severe headache within seconds. Another problem is that the different knobs on the mat make it extrememly uncomfortable. Its like sleeping on rocks. My boyfriend returned it because he couldnt use it either. I have heard some good things about massage chairs but this mat is a crock. We are saving up for a massage chair that is a lot more comfortable."
1,Actually 0 stars would be more accurate!,"This guy plays pure elevator music. Talk about bland, nondescript filler type of ""music"". This is the kind of stuff that is mindless and is totally forgettable background music. Yes, Kenny G is wealthy but he certainly is not a musician of merit. Pure meaningless PAP for the masses. YUCK!"
2,Don't recommend it ;(,"I was very suprised after i got this book . The pages were small, big font. The content was very poor. Very basic approach to the subject. All these information you can easly find in the internet. So if you really want to learn the subject i do recommend search for something more professional ."
2,It's a hat. A cheap hat.,"Arrived quickly, and in new condition. If you're looking for a hat, here you go. I didn't know how cheap a beanie could be until I got this one. It's very thin, very cheap, and too small to fit securely on a normal sized head. Given the choice, I would pay a little more for a better quality beanie. The call is yours."
2,ehhh,"Cute style, but really square on top. I guess I can't really complain since it is so cheap. I would not buy this again or in any other colors. Kinda look like spongebob head!!"
2,Too small,"This hat was way too small for my head. I guess I've got a big head, however, this hat deflated my ego. I gave the hat to a relative's kids."
4,Nice beanie,"This is a good benie hat, it's really warm and looks very cool, the only drawback is that since it's black it get dirty real quick, but overall it does what its meant to do..."
1,The wool is so thin it hardly protects against the cold,Pass on this item if you want your head to stay warm. The material is super thin. I had to buy a new hat when I went aboard because this one did not suffice.
3,Knit Beanie Visor Hat - Scull Cap Style - Black,"People with average head size will find it a little snug, if the manufacture made the hat a little larger I think I would have given it a higher rating."
5,Great cap,"Great cap. I like it because it's like a sock/knit cap with a brim, to shield the sun. You can then pull the edge down to cover your ears and neck a little better. I wear mine all the time, don't leave home in winter without it"
2,not impressed,"Arrived fast. Very thin, very cheap, itchy, and too small. Looks like it could fit a kids head better. I would have paid a little more for a better quality beanie."
4,looks better than seen on screen,softhope last longer than previous one i've hadlooks nicelike itit came a little late why i dont know
1,Worst movie Donnie Yen has done to date,"Had to watch this several times because I fell asleep I was so bored. Sad to see a talent imitate another actor, it was sad, form sound effects to actions his final fight is a flat out Bruce Lee imitation. From angles to moves it is a recreation of Bruce's fight as Chen Zhen, Jet Li made it his own in Fist of Legend, if I wanted to watch bruce I would but lets face it, his movies are dated and do not truely hold up well to modern films, why recreate it."
2,A big disappointment,"The title got me excited - I thought I was going to read narratives from chronic illness sufferers and was looking forward to a variety of perspectives. Imagine my disappointment then to find out that the author, a rheumatologist who ended up with debilitating arthritis himself, actually fictionalized each of the narratives based on conglomerations of several ""patient types"" he has dealt with because he feels ""factual stories lack emotional impact"". While Part I of the book are these fictionalized narratives and, quite frankly, lack emotional impact for me, Part II is made up of several very well done self-exploration exercises exploring feelings and aspects of chronic illness. With that in mind, as a self-help book, I can recommend its purchase, but if it's stories you're after, you may want a book with actual individuals in it!"
2,Fawning portait of still living (when written) author,"this was a christmas gift several years ago and while I ADORE everything that Davies wrote (esp Rebel Angels), this was a fawning, name-dropping, dull, pendatic read. Davies, I believe, was still living when it was written, and he cooperated in the writing of it, so there is no critical look at him, his life or really any aspect of his writing.I look forward to a new biography that doesn't treat Davies as a sacred cow. I grew up in the same area where davies was a newspaper editor and theatre guy and his put-on english accent and snobbiness didn't impress the people of my grandmother's generation.Still, I appreciate his writing, but wished this was a truer portrait of him, warts and all. I found it a drudge to go through"
3,GOOD FOCUS FOR A FIRST TIMER BUT NOT SO GOOD FOR OTHERS,"Nice enough attempt in exploring the marquis de Lafayette and his major assistance to the American Revolution but it misses on several points. It's almost as if it's too dry to explore some of the meatier issues. Also, if he's truly a lost hero why is he almost always mentioned in our history books? Anyway, for people who don't know much about him this is a good starter but if you've already studied the man then this is a very watered down version of his contributions. The commentary by Lafayette's descendant was a nice touch. WHEN WATCHED: early September 2011; OVERALL GRADE: C plus to B minus."
1,THE BOMBING OF GERMANY,"I AM VERY SORRY THAT I CAN NOT MAKE THIS REVIEW MUCH FUN.THE REASON IS THAT I WAS LOANED A DISC ENTITLED 'THE BOMBING OF GERMANY' AND THE DISC BROKE AS I TOOK IT OUT OF ITS PACKET. THE FRIEND WHO LOANED IT TO ME WAS A BRIGADER IN WW11 AND TREASURES HIS VIDEO COLLECTION. SO I WAS HORRIFIED AND SET ABOUT REPLACING IT ASAP.I WAS SO HAPPY THAT AMAZON COULD LOCATE A COPY FOR ME. HOWEVER ON RECEIPT, I FIND THAT I CAN NOT PLAY IT ON MY TV IN AUSTRALIA BECAUSE WE ARE IN AREA 4 AND THE DISC ONLY PLAYS IN AREA 1. I AM VERY FRUSTRATED AT PRESENT.REGARDSJOHN PUNCH"
3,Great for a beginner,"I bought this book because I took a skills assesment w/ Microsoft and it was their recommendation. Based on the complexity of the assessment I would have thought that it would have been much more in depth. It is very Top-Level. Good if you are just getting into ASP.NET 2.0, not a great reference if you are looking for the subtleties however."
5,Beautiful TV,"Its really hard to express the difference watching on a high quality hdtv makes. This is a beautiful brilliant TV with tons of inputs and great quality. I've owned for 2 months with no problems. Some complain about the size of the remote and the speakers, but both seem plenty adequate to me. I would recommend this tv to anyone."
1,A disappointment right out of the box,"Just received this as a birthday party gift today--already not working straight out of the box. INSTRUCTIONS: ""Once the starter piece reaches the bottom, you can launch ... Don't jump the start or the start gate will freeze!"" PROBLEM: My 5-yr-old of course tried to launch the cycles before we assembled the starter piece and there is NO GUIDANCE about how to unfreeze the gate--in the instructions, on the box, or on the website, nor is there any visible re-set button (or else it just came plain hard broke). This was his favorite gift; now he doesn't want to play with this or anything else he got, he's so bummed out. Way to go, Mattel!"
1,Stay away!,"Stay away from this book! If you need help preparing for the Praxis, buy an ETS or a Kaplan study guide. My husband and I compared both of these guides to this one, and REA is seriously lacking. The material isn't even relevant to what the PLT actually covers. How does REA publish this kind of junk?"
3,Poor Customer Service Included No Charge !,"I bought these and the first time I used it someone dropped the one of the lids and the knob cracked and came off. I contacted the customer service department for T-Fal and was told they don't sell the lids separately and told me basically to look around in Target or some other store and see if I can find a ""generic"" lid that will fit the pot. I kid you not. Good thing I bought a set HUH ! they don't have lids OR the knobs which simply attach via a screw which is what I first asked for but hey I'm a sport - I'll buy the whole lid. Then I went and bought a T-Fal toaster - what am I thinking. T-Fal sucks and Amazon should NOT represent them."
3,Does NOT work on induction cooktops,"We purchased this cookware after reading the above review stating that it works on induction cooktops AND after it came up under a search for ""induction cookware"". Well, after waiting way too long for this to arrive (it took acehardware outlet over a week to ship it out) we found that it does not, in fact, work on induction. The box itself states that it is ""suitable for all heat sources except induction."" They are hard anodized aluminum.Overall, the cookware seemed nice enough - nice comfy grips, not-too-heavy, and glass lids. They just aren't what we were hoping for."
3,Just sent this set back for a refund,"I reviewed cookware sets extensively over a few days and chose the t-fal professional set. I liked the price and the reviews. After using for about a month, I noticed that the large sauce pot had a sticky glue-like film inside of it. we only cooked pasta in it one time. Nothing we did would remove this glue-like substance from the inside of the pot. All the pots and pans were conditioned and washed as stated int he instructions. I came to the conclusion that this pot was a defect. I wanted to send back just this one pot for exchange, but they would only accept the entire set back and issue a refund, which I am doing. All the other pots, pans, and lids were fine."
5,Good value,"This book and the accompanying CDs are the best resource I have found in the way of ""how-to"" books for learning medical Spanish. The choice of translations is very accurate and the Spanish is generalized in that it will be understood by Hispanics from any country. The writing is personable and engaging, and there is a wealth of information on Latin culture. As an internist who has worked with Spanish-speaking patients for the last 20-odd years, I can say that the subject matter is very relevant and the questions are carefully phrased to ensure accurate responses. Very well done! I recommend it highly.Glenn Rogers, M.D."
4,Great Text - Needs Audio,"I got the Kindle Fire version. I kind of have a love/hate relationship with this book:The text itself is awesome, but it really needs audio which is unavailable with the Fire version. Many of the pictures do not have any English text. The scenarios they take you through are awesome and I feel the author(s) have written from personal experience with patient encounters. The vocabulary and encounters get more complex as you progress. Ultimately, you are directing the surgical team in the OR to perform repairs of a subdural hematoma. Okay, I'm lying, but you will be fully prepared for patient encounters by the time you finish this book, with culturally sensitive care.Overall, it is a wonderful experience. Loss of one star for no access to the audio available in the box set."
4,"The Return of The Vindicator, and The Abscence of Big Sexy!","The main event here was of course, the Sting/ Hollywood Hogan world title match. Perfect senaro of the good V.S. evil thing (Hogan is leader of the vicious heel group, New World Order AKA nWo; and Sting is the mysterious, untalking, WCW loner who comes back to town)and it's the key point of this pay-per-view. However, the match between Kevin Nash and The Giant that was supposed to happen did not take place, until the following month, so if you think it's here, don't be fooled! Also, Eric Bischoff makes a fine wrestling apperence against Larry Zybysko!"
1,Beat up with ungly sticker on the cover,"Sort of useful in a sophomoric way. Written in a hurry to make money, is my guess. Needs complete revision, good editing and good customer evaluation prior to publication"
2,Skip this one,"As a life-long student of the Stooges, I was excited by the prospect of such a weighty and apparently in-depth treatment of their filmed output. Unfortunately, this book merely assembles scraps of information from other readily-available sources, seemingly with no new research. The author seems intent on flaunting his academic background by overstuffing his analysis with references to classical literature and ancient languages. This is incongrous at first, but quickly becomes irritating. In short, if you want just one book that details the Stooges filmed output, you could do worse. But if you're a fan in search of new details, you're unlikely to find them here."
2,Straw does not fit NUK,I bought 4 of these thinking that they would fit my wide neck NUK bottles like the manufacturer says they do. Would not fit into bottle at all. Not even close.
1,MISLEADING Picture,"Beware... you will not get what is pictured. You will get smaller (3 oz) play-doh, the cookie cutters and the rolling pin are more cheaply made. The rolling pin does not have handles and the cookie cutters do not have borders/edges around them. Do NOT buy this product if you are expecting to get what is pictured."
5,Great Fun for 3 year old!,"My niece got this as a one of her holiday gifts and is having great fun with it. While she has used other playdoh sets before this one comes with ""scissors"" which she didn't have and some new molds. She says the scissors are like what she has in school and it has been encouraging her creativity. She just made a bed and blanket for one of the molded animals. Enjoy!"
5,Bag-o-fun!,Great set of playdough tools providing many hours of fun. Comes with a nice bag to store everything in.
3,"Not so great, but it seems to work briefly","I have a Pembroke Welsh Corgi/Australian Shepherd mix I adopted from the SPCA to find that he has severe skin allergies and if left to himself, he keeps gnawing until he's bloody and hairless. So, at the suggestion of some of my dog-owning friends, I bought this and the Epi-Soothe shampoo. Unfortunately, it only seems to help for maybe a day, sometimes less. He hates baths and is beginning to hate them more and more with me giving them to him daily. It's not the only treatment he's getting for the skin allergies, but I was hoping it would help more than it is."
4,Works Great,Sucks water 120ft with a 25 ft rise. Then pumps 200 ft and up another 25 ft - to 4 separate sprinklers. 40 PSI at pump and no pressure loss with all 4 sprinklers running! Only wish it were water proof as it is in a flood plane. We will see how it fares in the next few years when the water rises.
4,Good one to add to the shelf,"I bought this for my husband and to help me understand the process of building. It succeeded for me, and James said it gives a good over-view of boat building and answered a lot of questions, but needs to be backed up with Details of Classic Boat Building if someone is actually building their first wooden boat."
5,I give it a 10!,"This is a very funny episode that tells a tale of Hoss helping out an old miner and his dog battle three outlaws that are after some gold. The picture quality is excellent and this contains the original theme song. Once you see this episode, you'll want to watch the sequel to this one: Walter and the Outlaws. However, I don't think that one is out on video yet, but you can catch it on PAX TV."
4,"Cats love it, works pretty well","This has nothing on the furminator, but the cats actually use this on themselves if I attach it to something. The cats love to get ""brushed"" with this, and they like to chew on it and wrestle with it, too. They don't seem to have damaged it at all, though. The hair gets caught in the rubber/plastic teeth, and you can easily pull the hair out when you're done and dispose of it. So glad I got this. Only 4 stars because the cats like the furminator better and it doesn't get off as much hair as the furminator."
5,For the cat who hates grooming,"I have a cat who doesn't like the wire brush or the furminator. When she sees the other brushes she runs but she let me use this. Yes, it removed a lot of fur but it is a little hard to clean because the fur does stick to it."
2,Didn't remove any hair from my cats,This didn't work on my Burmese cats' coats at all. I could get very little hair off them even when I discovered I was supposed to be going around in circles. They didn't dislike the Zoom Groom because it didn't do anything.I think it may be meant for cats with thick coats or multiple layers of fur.I wondered if it would work in a similar manner to the Four Paws Love Glove Grooming Mitt for Cats and the answer is that it doesn't even come close to removing the loose hair and dander.
4,"Holiday postage delay, Good deal, Good article.","This took longer than promised to arrive, however, it was ordered a little before Christmas, and we expected some postal delay. Appears in good ordered, tried them out and they work well. I ordered this for someone else and they are very happy with this purchase."
3,works great but messy,This brush does a great job at getting rid of lose hair on my long-haired cats. BUT it doesn't hold the fur on to the brush so it gets everywhere. I just keep picking it up in my hand but I have to say - I'd like it more if it did a better job at not spreading fur everywhere.
2,ZoomGroom,"It's really not impressive at all. I figured it would have a brush type set up on the back of it, but it has these weird rubber cones that scared my cat. I don't like it, and it's really not worth the money."
5,A Great listen any time not just the holidays,I love TSO! The disk set is great and the added DVD is like being at the concert.
2,TS Orchestra Trilogy,"I was disappointed in most of the three CDs and most especially the DVD. While the quality of the music was great, there was a lot more singing than I anticipated. After all, TSO is an orchestra."
2,The Christmas Trilogy,"""The Christmas Trilogy "" by the Trans Siberian Orchestra did not meet my expectations. It was much rockier than I expected. I was very disappointed."
5,Excellent Purchase!,Excellent CDs (3) and DVD (1); I ordered them as a gift after enjoying the set myself. Disks came quickly and in good condition.
2,unexpected,"Too much like heavy metal. Was hoping for something similar to Manheim Steamroller...it doesn't compare. A few titles were great, the rest were embarassing to play at my office."
2,DVD is not like the real thing.,I saw them in concert 2 years ago - their concert was much more 'rock' like and all the songs were done better and by different singers that what I see in the video. I was disappointed with that. Apparently there's a difference between Christmas Cannon on the DVD (sung by kids) and Christmas Cannon Rock on the CD - sung by adult and very ROCK-like.I wanted a more 'rock' DVD like the concert I saw 2 years ago. Wasn't for me.They should have a DVD that literally is just their concert. This DVD didn't show their extravagant laser light show either.
1,Horrible Sheets,"This sheet set is soooo thin you can see through them, like a thin linen cloth. Definitely not something you would want to put next to your own skin let alone a little child's skin. I agree with the other customer review, the only reason this gets a star at all is because the print is so cute. I'm very disappointed with this product. It's a crappy product and I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Don't buy this!,This was a gift for our 4 year old and I can't stand it. The set takes FOREVER to put together and once it's set up it doesn't even work most of the time. It's very frustrating for my son. Don't buy this!
5,My Opinions,"There are two versions of this cd. The first one I purchased was the US version. The songs are awsome. The second one I recently purchased is the UK version and I like it a lot better. The songs on the UK version are new to me, unlike some of the songs that are on The US version. Both covers look the same but the UK has a total of 18 songs."
3,Fred Schneider - 'Just Fred' (Warner Bros.),"Pretty much aimed at B-52's completists.'Just Fred' is B-52's male vocalist's second solo effort.Nothing special here,but a decent alternative release.Some of the cuts that I found semi-entertaining were ""Whip"",""Sugar In My Hog"",""Coconut"" and ""Stroke Of Genius"".Should be able to find this CD for less than the price of a 20 oz. bottle of Coke."
2,Not 100% cotton - package says 60/40,"When I was placing my order, I saw one review that said these didn't seem to be 100% cotton. But I also saw the description that said 100% cotton, so I figured maybe the reviewer was mistaken. Got my order yesterday, looked at the packaging on the product itself (I got the white ones), and it says 60% cotton, 40% polyester. So listen to that other review (or this one, whatever) and if you are looking for 100% cotton, look elsewhere."
5,perfect,I use these for wipes for baby because they are so soft and washable. I LOVE THEM! Perfect for cloth diapering mommies.
1,increases your spam,"we now know that exploits like webbugs etc are used in html to confirm ""visiting a site."" well in html email adding a webbug that includes your email address is a way to confirm the email address is live and valid and worse yet, that the email has been read. this exploit is now very common. Spamkiller actually does this not just for the mail you kill but even for mail it filters and you never read.IE every message with a webbug returns a message to teh spammer that your account is live and that you read spam! You can not turn off this feature in either spamkiller 5.0 or 4.0. this is incredible!use this product and you will be added to every spammer's list, not only as a live email address, but as someone who opens their spam mail (even if you don't!)"
2,Didn't hold up at all...,"This was a beautiful product. I bought it for my mom at Christmas. I waited until the last minute and it actually took about three weeks to ship. After one use, my mom woke up to find that the jar had actually separated all the way around the middle (like someone had chopped it in half with a samurai sword) and all of the liquid was on the counter and ground. It may have just been hers but buyer beware definitely."
2,not as pictured,"Beware. The spigot pictured is a classic bronze. However what they ship is a chrome spigot. When I tried to rectify this I can tell you that like other reviews this company is the most difficult I have ever encountered. I attempted emails and their online chat...when I told them about the bogus picture, I was told that ""they are working on it"". seems to me that they could simply put a disclaimer near the picture if they do not have a picture of what is available.The jar looks great but poor customer service will prevent me from getting this one.Good luck, if you order it."
1,Customer service horrible!,"I have had nothing but trouble with my infusion jar. The gasket failed and I lost a whole bottle of vodka when it leaked all over my counter. I contacted the company and they denied there was any problem. This was only my second batch of infused vodka, my jar was only two months old. I kept contacting the company and they sent me a totally different gasket. Had to keep calling, emailing and using their on line live chat and finally they agreed to send another gasket. It's been two more months and they still haven't sent it. Customer service is horrible and the spigot leaks. Great idea but don't deal with this company or waste your money."
3,What the...,"Don't worry it's not as bad as everyone says it is, ok there is an over abundence of commercialism on this once underground series. Yet some tracks are hot and worth listening to. ""The Life"" with pharaohe and styles p is hot. (Its mainly the beat and pharaohe which makes the track shine) ""My life"" with kool g rap is dope. ""Put it the air"", ""They Don't Flow"", ""Spit Again"" and ""On The Black (Golden Era)"" are good too. Mainly a dissapointment but still good for a collection."
3,"Soundbombing, what happened?","I'm sure plenty of people bought this album just because they saw the word Soundbombing blazed across the cover. Never again will I make such a hasty purchase. This has to be one of the most commercial records from Rawkus Records. If you are looking for underground emcee'ing like I was, back up slowly and make a hasty retreat. What are you waiting for? GO! GO! GO!"
1,Can't we just skip to Soundbombing 4?,"And forget that this one was released? Why would I buy a CD with mainstream garbage on it - the reason we listen to Rawkus is to hear underground hip hop music. SB III is a travesty and everyone knows it. While there might be 1 or 2 songs that are listenable, 1 or 2 songs is a single, not an entire album. Don't waste your hard-earned [money] on this coaster. If you see a 5 star rating from anyone who reviews this album, they probably work in Marketing for the record company. Don't buy it!"
5,Great gift,"Very popular series always out at the library. 10-year old son thrilled to receive it. Age appropriate information and as always for DK, excellent photos."
4,She must not lose him a second time...,"From back cover: Doctors had ordered Zoe Winthrop not to try to see Ross Lyneham. His amnesia following the accident had robbed him of all memory of her. But Zoe was compelled to find out if there was still a chance for happiness. She longed to tell him who she was and what they had once meant to each other. Yet she dared not, lest he discover that the woman in his past whose cruel betrayal caused his deep distrust of women was Zoe, herself. Surely there must be some way out of their situation!"
5,Manifesto for Good People Trapped in Bad Organizations,"The seven essentials of organizational intelligence include widespread truth and rights; freedom of enterprise, liberated teams, equality and diversity, voluntary learning networks, democratic self-rule, and limited corporate government. It was this book, and the very strong applause that the author received from all those attending OSS '96, that caused me to realize that the U.S. Intelligence Community is just chock full of very good people that want to change, but are not being allowed to change by the organizational circumstances within which they are trapped-frozen in time and budget."
3,Great for puppy,We purchased this for our teething chocolate lab puppy. He loved it and it was a great item for him to play with. However at about five months it was no longer safe as he was able to break it and small pieces could of been swallowed or choked on. Next time I would order the next size up and not bother with the small size.
1,DANGER! DON'T PUT TREAT INSIDE FOR PUPPY!,"DANGER! My puppy - apprx 9 weeks old and over 15 lbs got her lower jaw stuck in the treat whole of a puppy KONG! We had to CUT the thick rubber around her jaw to dislodge it. I have written the company - no response yet! I am a big KONG supporter normally -- I foster many dogs, they all love it. But the puppy did this trying to get the treat out. It may be ok if you don't put any treat in it...You have been warned!"
2,kind of wasteful,"I bought this for my puppy who is very active and always seems hungry, and I was kind of disappointed with it. It is designed the way that you have to buy only their brand products to fill in the holes, and those snacks are not cheap at all. I tried to put some stuff that I already have, and the holes is either too big or too small for what I have. The peanut butter didn't work out for me either because my puppy was never able to reach into it. She now uses it as a toy every once in a while, but to me, it did not serve its purpose."
5,: ),My 9 month old chihuahua mix loves this thing. It bounces everywhere and keeps him very entertained. I'll continue buying them as he gets older.
4,Very Useful,This book was instrumental in developing the policies and procedures for my preschool center. It offers wonderful information for the new leader or supervisor as well as veterans in the business. I have been in the business for over 12 years and was able to gather some very useful information. The book contains activities that will help solidify the concepts expressed. I would definately recommend this title.
3,Beware the Religion Mongers,"The best of spirituality unites humans, the worst of religion divides them. Although I would agree that, sometimes, the writing and ideas in CP are somewhat simplistic, Mr. Redfield is, admirably, part of the former, while the two negative reviewers are obviously part of the later and that's too bad for everyone."
4,very good movie.,"Although I did not expect a story about a lesbian marine, it was tastefully done anqd enjoyable to watch.Worth the time to watch as she helped a troubled girl"
3,Very inspiring but slow and semi boring,Movie is uniteresting slow and mediocre at best but.....the ending literally saved it all. If you find yourself watching this make sure to catch the ending! i was going to give it 1 star but after the ending i bumped it up to 3and half stars maybe 4 but i feel like iw asted my time watching this movie
3,What happened to the free Prime version?,Well what I saw of it was good. It was on the Prime free list and I watched most of it then I tried to resume it the next day and it was not anymore? Kinda hate that I paid $79 for a deal that would not let me finish the movie I had already started! Won't be renewing Prime!
3,A Marine Story,"It was a good movie, but I was expecting more of a love story. That it wasn't disappointed me. Not a movie I would watch twice."
2,Love Dreya but I Pass,"I had high hopes for this one since I loved Dreya Weber in The Gymnast. But this one disappointed right from the start with a surprisingly poor script. The premise is about a soldier returning home after being discharged under Don't Ask Don't Tell, but the movie plays more like a dismal soldier returns from duty to a poor hick town and doesn't know what to do with her life so she trains a young delinquent girl to ready her to join the military. Add in a plot about a homophobe who loses an arm wrestling match to Dreya's character and you have one mess of a movie. (stalker, cops, meth lab explosion etc.) Also, the actress who portrayed the recruit was wooden in her acting. The pace of the movie was slow. A brief love scene between Dreya and a woman she meets at a bar was awkward. The only positive is that Dreya's acting rose above the material."
1,Poor story not worth watching,The movie jumps around way too much and is hard to follow. We would not recommend taking the time to watch this movie.
4,AMArine Story,Pretty good movie-enough of a story line to keep my interest and enough action for me to enjoy the movie.
2,"Terry Jones & Technology = Terrific Fun!, but this isn't it","Unfortunately I wrote my original review on the misapprehension that this video was the same one I had seen before featuring Terry Jones. It is not.This video is interesting, but it is disorganized, featuring some inventions but more about lost cities and building techniques.The episodes with Terry Jones(not this tape however) are one of the most informative and interesting ways to explore the ancient (and not so ancient) world. Terry Jones' narration and participation make this well worth watching. He entertains and informs, but never condescends. He is so clearly having fun that he brings the viewers along with him on a ramble of discovery. I highly recommend it, and have shown portions to my Latin students. They never fail to be enthralled. Treat yourself and get that video (not this paltry substitute) if you can."
2,"Re-recorded songs with ""original"" artists","Somewhere in small print it should have stated most songs are re-recorded using the original artists....problem is although the artist is alive, his/her/their voice passed away years ago. The background music is fairly ""original"" but many of the artists have lost the vitality in their voice they had in the '60s. Ben E King's ""Spanish Rose is a good example. ""Sunday Will Never Be THe Same"" by Spanky is another. You begin to feel sorry for the artist (and yourself) after just a few moments. Some songs must have been originally stereo as they are not marked as re-done but retain the original sound (""Laugh Laugh"" is a good example). It can be argued that there are a lot of songs for the money, but don't expect the music to be what you remembered from the greatest of music years; 1960's."
3,Hard to use as an easy reference,"Great information, but I was hoping for a book that I could use in the clinic as a quick reference quide. This is more of a study guide - which maybe it stated that somewhere and I just didn't notice."
4,In search of the holy grail.,"In this book, Lovejoy has been told by a nice old man that he has access to the real Holy Grail! Lovejoy doesn't believe him (Do you think he was just born yesterday?), but when his new friend is murdered, Lovejoy knows that there may be something more to this. And at the very least, someone has to avenge poor Henry's death. One thing about a Lovejoy story - they are never boring. The reader picks up all kinds of info on antiques, and the weapons that are actually used in the story are always something new and unique. These books are delicious! Lovejoy is such a genuinely crooked, but loveable hero, that he captivates you as you read. It may be difficult for some to get beyond the British slang, but that too is charming in these little gems."
4,The Refreshing Sounds Of Lex Norwood,Lex Norwood Is by far the most slept on musician in the music world! He has a mature sound and writes meaningful and warm pieces of beautiful music! I rate this album 4 to 5 stars and know that he has a bright future ahead of him!
1,"Wrong Singers, Sounds Horrible",This CD set looks like a good one and a good value but it definitely is not. These are not the original singers. It sounds like karaoke from the bar or something. Save your money.
3,Watch that menhir!,"Rene Goscinny, Asterix and the Big Fight (Orion, 1966)One of the earlier Asterix books, this one has the village's leader, Vitalstatistix, called out by a rival village leader who's become a pawn to the Romans for a one-on-one fight. All well and good, being the Vitalstatistix, like the rest of his village, is invincible, as long as he has the magic potion-- the only problem is that, thanks to a small fumble with a menhir, Obelix has transformed druid and chief potion-maker Getafix into a drooling idiot. Another druid is sent to cure Getafix, and-- you guessed it-- another fumble, another menhir, another drooling idiot. Can the boys get Getafix back into shape in order to brew up some potion for Vitalstatistix in time for the big fight?Predictable, of course-- anyone who's watched two or three episodes of a sitcom knows exactly how to cure Getafix-- but the pleasure, as always, is in the journey, not the destination. Another great way to spend time among the gently madcap. ***"
5,Awesome book,This book is great for a medical student learning EKGs. It is a pretty good read as well.
2,Looking for more,"It's nice to add this classic to my collection of golf movies but was disapointed somewhat in this one.I wasn't expecting anything elaborate, knowing the era it was from, but I was expecting more than a two scene play that reminded me of something a 5 year old might have made up. I'm a big fan of W.C Fields but this was not one of his high points of production or writing.I would not have bought it had I seen it before my purchase."
1,"Lifetime batteries or two weeks, whichever comes first ...","We too are on our second scale after burning through two sets of ""lifetime"" batteries in a month. The second scale stopped working after about five weeks, which is just as well, because I was putting on weight anyway.If it's a scale-sized paperweight you seek, by all means, buy away. But if you're seeking something that actually functions, look elsewhere."
1,Unbalanced,"This thing was almost impossible to activate on my hardwood floor, bathroom tiles or even my dining room table. After several minutes of shifting for a position it liked, I would finally get a reading. Then, after about a week, the battery died and I couldn't get it to work at all. This product is useless! Save your money for a better scale!"
1,Skip this one...,"If you do buy this book, do not read before driving or operating heavy machinery... It is extremely boring and sleep-inducing... I suppose I should mention some specific points in the book as examples, but I can't, because nothing written in it will stay in your memory for longer than a couple of hours...It was very difficult to finish, which was probably the same feeling held by the editor, as this book is riddled with typos and grammatical errors...Anyway, stay away from Marrow..."
1,"""Shakedown"" by Kenneth R. Timmerman","If you want to read an excellent NONFICTION book about Jesse Jackson, read ""Shakedown : Exposing the Real Jesse Jackson"" by Kenneth R. Timmerman."
5,Good balloons.,I can blow these us with one breath. but I am above average when it comes to lung capacity. they hold air well. wish there were more colors and that it was 5 dollars less.
4,I like this brand of balloons-flexible-durable-great colors,"I've been a balloon artist for about 10 years now-off and on- I do fairs and carnivals for schools and fund raising efforts, I do not charge for my services. I have used quite a few different balloon manufactures and find this and one other to be top of the line. Summer-warm weather are not a balloons friend and I can tell you that it is best done on cool days or inside is where I would recommend. Heat can really make the balloon pop and ruin your beautiful creations. These balloons work great and when I teach a class how to twist I almost always use these balloons.I love the plain colors, but not the metallic types. They are shorter and harder to twist. I would suggest these balloons to the twister out there and especially a newbie-success is important when learning a new skill...you don't want the newbies popping balloons constantly. Store these in the freezer in warm weather to keep them fresh."
3,Great price for these balloons.,"These balloons were in fair condition. When we were blowing them up, about 1 in 5 popped before we could make the balloon animal. It seems like the rubber was old. We've never had this problem with qualatex balloons before."
4,This watch gets comments everywhere I go.,"Great watch for the money. Whenever I wear it, people always comment on it. I tell everyone, it's my casual Sunday watch. It's pretty cool looking. It probably won't last a lifetime, hey for five bucks it a nice watch and a great value. I might purchase another one. Peter Vrouhas"
4,Good look at a famous football rivalry,"A good review of both game action and trends in college football & in the philosophy of both schools. I do wish Carew had done brief game synopses of all the games (he probably did synopses of 30 or so, and more in-depth discussions of some of the more famous or interesting ones). Also, more photos would have been nice. As a post-rivarly attendee of Holy Cross (Class of '92) I appreciate the importance of the rivalry but also understand why it had to end. Carew's book gives a nice glimpse into what I missed."
5,So soothing,"I keep this in the car and we often listen to it on the way home from day-care in the evening -- it's very soothing, great winding-down music, but still fun and something you can sing to. I love it, and find myself listening to it even when I'm kid-free. Someone to Watch Over Me is incredible, and who would have ever thought that Mickey Mouse Club march could be a lullaby? It works. Lots of kids' music is barely tolerable to me. This is not merely tolerable, I actually really enjoy it. Love the Nicky's Jazz 4 kids cd, too."
1,Misleading title: too narrow a focus.,"A book whose title is ""How a new breed of officers led the submarine force to victory in World War II"" should tell me a lot more than about three or so officers from the USS WAHOO. Granted, Richard O'Kane, Roger Paine and George Grider, were brave, aggressive, and had ""cojones grande"" and have been honored as such. But there were DOZENS of aggressive submarine officers who rose to command and took the fight to the Japanese equally hard. I would have liked to read more about them in a book so titled.Clay Blair's Silent Victory remains the best study of submarine skippers during World War II and early editions included photos of many of them. The U.S. Naval Institute is reprinting this. Save your money on ""Unrestricted Warfare"" and buy Silent Victory."
3,Stop thumping the thesaurus!,"I have to agree with other reviewers who praised this book's heavy continuity usages and tying it all in with the current Star Trek universe as we know it, but my main beef is that the book was horribly overwritten. A classic example is when one character meets Guinan. The author keeps going on about the ""smiling orange poppy faces mocked her again and again, with their grinning petals..."" etc. Enough with the metaphors! If this is supposed to be military space opera, tone down the writing! We know you can use a thesaurus, prove to us that you can use it correctly."
1,Academy Dropout,"It looked like fun, a book about Starfleet Cadets. Sadly, Susan Wright manages to impart interesting information in clunky dialogue and dull descriptions. There are vague moments of interest in the young characters, but unfortunately most of them succumb to the ""Wesley Syndrome"": any personality they might display is quickly sacrificed to the need for them to be annoying over-achievers. They just happen to find themselves in the right place at the right time to shine. The cast of characters reads as if Wright had loooked at a personality assessment test and assigned one characteristic to each character (""perky"", ""insecure"", ""shy"", ""merry"") and none of them ever develop another dimension. The Quad concept (eight cadets of differing backgrounds and year levels live and work together) is carelessly discarded as two characters are almost immediately written out, and the rest of the plot is just as cursory. What a pity. What a wasted opportunity."
4,Great for those tired of mainstream Trek,Hey lets face it the same people get boring after awhile. This gives us a freash new look into Star Trek. The Academy is rarely explored in-depth but here it is. I like that we finally get the Lesbian charecter in here. Although I am not a gay right activist I support the lifestyle choices people I just don't agree with them and it is about time ST addressed the issue fully. It was a little disconnected but otherswise great story. Also trying to cover 4 years in one book not a great idea should have had a for part series or something similar.
3,Trek Novel for P-Platers,"The Best and the Brightest lets you experience the lives and times of Starfleet Academy students. Although this novel would naturally appeal to 18-21 year olds, who wish to read about shared experiences of young love and university jealousies, it was also pleasing to see that heteronormativity isn't the only option acceptable as 'the norm' in the future. Susan Wright does include a same-sex relationship between to female classmates - bravo to her for being prepared to 'Go Boldly where no other Star Trek episode has gone before', although there were episodes that danced around the fringes. An enjoyable, light read that could have benefited more from not trying to include to many protagonists and plots. Would still recommend it happily."
5,TIME TRIAL IS TERRIFIC,"As a mystery author, I had the honor of moderating an author panel at a recent Left Coast Crime convention upon which R.E. Derouin sat. I read TIME TRIAL in preparation for my moderator duties, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. TIME TRIAL takes place in Mr. Derouin's adopted hometown of Ouray Colorado. Detective David Dean has left his home in Pennsylvania to recover from gunshot wounds. He finds trouble follows him to scenic Colorado, and TIME TRIAL is a fast-paced and complex thriller. I recommend it highly, as I do the other works by Ray Derouin, a talented writer, as well as a charming and interesting man."
3,Ok But Breaking No New Ground,"Picked this up on a flyer, based on all the hype. While well performed, after thrity some years of listening little here that seemed particularly fresh, keen or innovative, with a long list of other performers in mind that have done somewhat similar work better: Blood Oranges, Bad Livers, Howe Gelb and Giant Sand or, for that matter, on ocassion the Band or even the Rolling Stones! By comparison, this sounds rather mainstream and commercial. Expect some reading this will be indignant -- after all, a lot of critics stumbled over their own tongues on this one -- but there really is much more vital and varied music out there, and has been for quite a while."
1,CD To Avoid,"Read a lot of great reviews about this CD. I thought it would be right up my alley, as I have a broad range of musical tastes, and am especially drawn to heartfelt folk rock.The damn shame of it is this double CD is truly a ""double bummer"". Not a single cut I would revisit again, and Lord knows I've tried. I've flipped these discs on several times, under various circumstances, and never found anything to hang my hat on. Mediocre melodies, clap trappy, no balls rock, middle of the road production. If you like decent folkish stuff with real hooks, try anything by Grant Lee Buffalo (Phillips), or Badly Drawn Boy and stay away from this mess."
4,A starter if you want to understand Wilco,"The first step in what would become Wilco and solid steps to brash off any ""alt country"" label placed on the band (although I still don't know whats wrong with this title). This album can be enjoyed as a gentle listen the whole way through, or taken in pieces. I have recently rediscovered Wilco and wonder how I lived without this double album in my musical library. At a time when music was going in too many directions (and heading in the direction of Britney, Janet, and R & B acts), this album should have been the foundation of my teenage high school years. I couldn't be happier, however, that I at least discovered it now."
4,You Could've Swore You Heard it Before,"With a million musicians going forward, hearing one go backward is quite refreshing. With swinging and fiddling on ""Dreamer in My Dreams"" or aching pedal steel on ""The Lonely 1"", Tweedy and Company play out their ambition without sounding ambitious - in a good way. In the same vein as Lucinda Williams, they manage to sound drunk and yet in full posession of their faculties and heart. Ok, some of this album is filler. But those disenchanted with straight-up rock and roll these days may get religion again listening to this album."
3,Almost there,"You know that Wilco are actually deserving of the cornball alt-country tag they helped pioneer when their sprawling '96 sophomore can take you from a jangled Nebraskan disharmony found in acts like Cursive through Mellencamp's corn-husked embrace, all on BT's first two tracks. The rest follow enjoyably the literate western-alternative-pop suit, neither consistently wowing like future growth would yield, nor boring with rampant pulse-lessness which, in all fairness, could come easy to many other groups doing similar material."
5,I bought two copies!,"If you need to get up to speed on the XML recommendation for serious application development, this book is a very informative explanation of W3C's results. It's an excellent reference work. It provides thoughtful insights into some fairly complicated subjects. Colleagues wanted to read my first copy so much that I bought another one. It is not a tutorial, not a hands-on code walk-through, and not for the casual user. It's precisely what it says it is -- the ""annotated specification""."
3,"It is ""ok""","Used this book for a class on John Wesley. The author had some good information, but makes reference to modern things such as a Toronto incident, without explaining what it was. If using this book, you have to be ready to do a lot of supplimental research. Also, the author refers to Wesley's wife as Molly, yet every other biography, as well as Wesley's journals, refer to her as Mary. Tompkins seems to want to make his own twist without doing extensive research or referencing."
1,This Book is Deceptive and is ruining lives,"[...] I have never met Mr. Li Hongzhi, but i can tell you that his philosophy and moral guidance has made me all the more, truthful, compassionate, and tolerant. This book should receive no stars because it is simply a propaganda tool by the persecutors of Falun Gong, namely the CCP."
1,communist propaganda,"This book is obviously just another sad attempt of the CCP to continue to brainwash its citizenry and those most unquestioning souls around the world. Pathetic, unscholarly and ridiculous. Read ""Zhuan Falun""."
1,My experience as a Falun Dafa practitioner,"I have practiced Falun Gong for 3 years now. I am a 3rd year medical student. In the past I had many long-term chronic physical problems. They were all relieved from practicing the exercises of Falun Dafa. Since practicing I have become a very kind considerate person in society. I now think about others before myself in most cases. I have had a new lease on life, where I make friends with everyone instead of judging them as I did in the past. My heart has really been opened by this beautiful sacred practice. I hope that there are not any more of these types of publications. This material is slanderous and offense it should be taken off the market. The lies emanating from a few paranoid people at the top of the PRC government are not true. There are people practicing Falun Gong in 60 countries around the world very happily. Why is China the only country in the world who is slandering Falun Gong??"
1,how can this book be on Amazon??,"a book written on the base of tons of innocent blood.a book which justifies the 'CCP style Nazism', the bloody genocide.a book which is not worthy even to open.Horrible and disgusting."
1,Ludicrous Communist Chinese Government Propaganda,"Save your money! This poorly written book is simultaneously ridiculous and libelous. Its trumped up ""evidence,"" clearly produced by Communist China's chillingly far-reaching propaganda machine, could only sway people who are too naive to question its obviously flawed ""information."" Well known for its escalating, egregious human rights violations (e.g., a death sentence handed down for a man ""convicted"" of smuggling Bibles), Communist China has the largest remaining propaganda machine in the world. Don't be fooled - this is simply more of the same."
5,"Bush Babees, where are you!?!?","This album is still so fresh - even after 8 years. I've had it since it came out and it's one of those rare albums you can listen to over and over. Seems a lot of people never got to know about them. Such a shame. However, pure quality outlasts all the mediocre bullstuff in the long run. If you like the sounds of Tribe Called Quest, The Roots, Mos Def, De La Soul, Talib, DJ Spinna, etc. etc. this is for you. Don't hesitate: get it. Dope lyrics, a lot of energy, different topics, couple of dope cameos and some BEAUTIFUL beats!!! Pure niceness. So, now in 2004 i gotta wonder: Bush Babees, where y'all at????"
4,It's a breath of fresh air in the hip-hop industry,"Well many may not be familiar with the artist but that is no reason not to purchase this exciting album. These boyz are no wu-tang but there collection of incredible beats and sounds throughout the album totally astonished me, how some practically unknown group can come out with something so impressive. Well done BB."
3,Not Bad,"First, I wanna say that Mr. Man and Lee Majors are dope MCs. Witty and insightful rhymes flow throughout the album. However the production needs a little work. There's also quite a bit of the jamaican style rapping and singing which i can't really get down with. It's just not my style. Also, Mos Def was wasted on The Love Song. For these reasons, Mr. Man and Lee Majors are just barely able to salvage this joint from the used CD store."
3,Animal Kingdom,Movie was difficult to understand at the beginning because of the Australian accent. Story was interesting but slow in spots.
1,"Overrated, Dull Movie","This movie was two hours of dull, pedestrian drama. I don't understand all the raves. The boxcover mentions something about this being Australia's answer to Goodfellas? Are they joking? This is more like a watered down version of Bully, in a way. I don't like to tell people to avoid movies, but this is one everyone should skip. I can't believe Guy Pearce wastes his talent doing films like this. The plot holes were pretty ridiculous too. This was a pretty amateurishly made movie."
3,it's alright.,"This could be a much better film. I just wish the director could delves deeper into the mind of the grandson and deepen his perspectives around what is happening between the grandmother and his uncles. I keep on waiting for the characters to be fleshed out much more. But the film just merely touches the surface. It's like an unfinished movie. Interesting but halfway through, the plots sort of hurried. Nevertheless, the atmosphere of this flick is tight. This is a crime family drama. Jacki Weaver deserves her Oscar nominations in my humble opinion. Rent, don't buy."
5,Just Fabulous!!!,"If you like warioland, you will love this game.Is a lot of fun to play, I am a mom of three, and guess what?I bought it for my self I am simply loving it."
4,Wario Land 4--Its ok............but not THAT good........,"Wario Land 4 for GBA was an OK game but it lacked LENGTH. I beat the game in about a week...where as Wario Land 3 took me almost a month and a half to conquer. Wario Land 4 has EXCELLENT graphics and INCREDIBLE soundtracks that make you want to ask...""Where'd it go?"" after you've beaten the game. Even though, it was just as fun and challenging as Wario Land 3. Overall, I would recommend this game for anyone who likes a good challenge! Thanks for reading!"
1,this game [is no good],don't listen to them after like one hour of fun and then it gets boring if you want to get a good game involving mario don't waste your money on this buy mario world its longer and it has replay value plus the last boss is praticly impossible on warioland 4 it is the lamest game ive ever played Ive played better on the first nentendo system and yes i own it I dont to many stores here to buy games so I wasted [my money] on it dont waste your money
3,This game is okay.,This game is okay since you get to be wario and the various levels are fun. I suggest you rent it.
1,HORRIBLE,are you kidding me? i bought this game and within less than a week i returned it! it was the worst game i have ever played! if you like wario get one of the old wario games like warioland 2 for the original gba or... you can just hate wario!sure at first you play it it seems good... i loved it at first but then it just gets lamer and lamer i mean who ever heard of getting stung by a bee and turning all swollen and flying... it is ridiculous! o and turning into a triangle block! i couldnt even lookat it in stores it was so horrible and not to mention the price... (depending on where you get it) for that piece of junk! im serious im not just writing this cus all my other reviews are usually 5s but this game is horrible kirby is a pretty bad game but not worse than this! i fell asleep while playing it wen i woke up my batteries were barely left! they should probably give you some free bateries with it!
4,Great purchase,"I have owned this Cello for nearly two years now. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. The only things I had to upgrade were the fine tuners. They had become very stiff and had to turn over the year and a half they were on the cello. The bridge does seem a bit high but it is playable. For the money, this is a great buy."
4,Nice.,This air rifle is stronger than most and it looks good to. Me and a couple of Friends had an air soft war and they made me quit using this because this gun shoots so fast it stuck a BB in one of their legs. When you buy this though you need to buy a sight for this because it doesn't have iron sites. the bipod comes with it. every so often you need to grease the bolt or it gets hard to push in and pull out.
3,Not that great a book,"Poor Wizard's Almanac tries to tie together all of the nations of the D&D campaign world into one easily digestible work, but with poor results. This book lists nations on one-by-one basis, dealing with each in an extremely limited way (listings include only the basic geography, customs, army size, and major sites. No maps of any sort are included for the small-scale locations, although they would be appreciated). Further on, the world history is dealt with on an event-by-event basis, leading to a section describing the current status of all things. The listings are quite disorganized and can be quite confusing, and while they provide some amount of flavor to the campaign, most of the data is generic (and unnecessary) filler.This handbook is not the most useful or interesting. Either buy one of the more specific works, or use your imagination."
5,Album captures live show perfectly!,"This album subtley yet proudly displays all the nuences of a Bela Fleck and the Flecktones show: From Bela's insertion of the Beverly Hillbilies theme into his solos to Victor's ""flamenco"" bass technique. Awesome!"
2,get what you pay for,"This is super light and has a thick plastic case so it's good for trekking. but the legs basically melt when they're directly above fire-or at least they get bendable, and sometimes allow your dinner to slide into the fire. recommend elevating it above the fire with some rocks."
5,terrific book,"The best surgery book out there. Detailed, full-color drawings give me confidence that I can actually do the procedure. I did my first GDV last week with this book!"
2,Just not the same,"I purchased 3 of the wind chimes for myself and 2 friends, from House of Rice. They're pretty, but they're very small, and really don't have that sound I recall as a child.But, they're the cheapest priced, which wasn't really cheap for their size, at $13.00 each, plus shipping. I see that now they're $17.00!"
4,Great Value,"This stroller is great for the price. The straps are really flimsy, but they do the job. I love all the storage space. It is compact for a double and easy to manouver."
5,Great Product,A Must Have if you are into battery devices. Both rechargeable and disposable. It will save time and money in the long run. Plus you can match up batterys so you don't damage your electronic devices. One bad cell in a group can oxidize pretty quickly.
1,Not So Good,"I have read several Spinelli books and have rated them all a four or above-except this one. This book builds up two characters only to stop the story once they are known to us and start a completely different story. This happens 3 times!!! Different characters, incomplete story. If he had started and finished with any one of these characters, it could have been a decent book. As it is, I just feel like I was left hanging and wasted time I could have spent on another book. Synopsis: Great author, just read his other books."
3,The Library Card,In the book The Library card they go through 4 different characters that have all been affected by a library card. After each there is a moral told. This book is a good book because you would think that something in the subject of a library card would be boring but Jerry Spinelli makes it really interesting. I don't recommend this book to people who do not enjoy reading a lot. I do recommend this book to someone who likes to read a book that doesn't make any sense until the end.
1,Don't Check This Out With YOUR Library Card,"Here is what I have to say about this book. I had to read it for school. And it was TERRIBLE!!! This book is plotless, useless, boring, weird, and most of all, tacky. How many books have you read that constantly mention libraries? I just did. It mentions it in every story, which gets QUITE repititive after a while. Plus, also some of the characters in this book have the weirdest names in history. For example, there is a guy in this book named Mongoose! That sounds odder than most names, (no offense to the people with unique names out there.) My advice, there is an invisible warning label on this book saying ""THIS IS ONE OF JERRY SPINELLI'S FLOPS!"" If you think this book is useless, great. But if you want to read it anyway, don't say the guy with the one-star review didn't warn you! So be careful. Until next time...."
3,Knots in my Yo-Yo String,"Hi! If you read this story you will get grossed out. You want to know why? In this story the author Jerry Spinelli, a kids author, tells about how he grows up and goes step by step about how being a kid helped him to become a writer. So what is the gross part? Well, he tells all about stuff like kissing girls and hitting his friend with a rock. I like this story because it is interesting and has alot of details about his life as he was growing up and this book is good. Farewell!"
1,A Cruel Hoax,"Craniosacral therapy is a complete farce. There is no pulse to the spinal fluid that is not directly caused by the cardiovascular system, and skull bones are fused early in life, thus making any perceived shifting of them illusory. It's just another placebo ritual masquerading as science. The surest sign of that is the complete lack of hard scientific evidence (ie controlled double-blind studies) supporting it, and instead a reliance on testimonials such as those written here.The author actually thinks that individual cells in the body have an individual consciousness and can verbalize their ""thoughts""! It would be funny were it not so sad, and were people with legitimate medical needs not wasting valuable time, energy and money on such nonsense."
1,"High tech, low performance",I bought this premium product to assure reliable performance. Mouse has features that duplicate those of browser and Isp. I don't need them. Left click button now continuously double clicks. First request for assistance was impersonal and gave no other option but to ship mouse off for repairs. I owned and used C64 with original joysticks for 15 years. This product was very unsatisfying and customer support poor. I am only user and am 61 yr old woman so rough treatment not the problem. If low tech user like me gadgets unnecessary. Should have had trouble free performance for more than 6 months.
5,Available on NBC,Season One (all 18 episodes) currently available to watch at [...]. I found this show to be unrealistic but entertaining. Try before you buy! :)
2,Ruining Rudy's Reputation,"I agree with Michael Edelman (below), there are many essays in this collection that just don't merit anthologizing.I used to have a pretty high opinion of Mr. Rucker, but reading this book took him down a few notches. His travelogues are ""nothing to write home about,"" his self-aggrandizement gets annoying, his extravagant personal claims about cyberpunk and transreal writing are laughable, and his essays on Bruegel add nothing to art appreciation.The companion volume of fiction, ""Gnarl!"" is a much better read."
3,Too many 5 star opinions...,"This CD in my opinion is precisely where ""NOT"" to start with Grant Lee Buffalo...The CD Mighty Joe Moon is probably your best bet if you want to get started in the most accessible direction. I agree with a few of the reviewers when saying it takes time to understand this CD, it is eventually rewarding. I believe a 5 star rating is a special thing and this record may not even be Grant Lee's 3rd best record...to complete your collection of GLB's music you will end here with copperopolis but ther is no reason to start here...the Mighty Joe Moon CD is 4 1/2 Stars"
2,turntable sucks,basically turntable friction builds up crazily after stringing a couple of racquets. It is now a pain to rotate the turntable.experience here:[...]
2,Racquet Stringing,"The turn table is not strong as should be. Stringing crosses, the clamp moves an inch (sometimes more) sideways jamming to the main strings after releasing cross string from griper. The table is three peaces mounted together by factory (not good). Also the turn table base is not properly square, one end always spins higher than the other side. Do not recommend."
3,pleasing pop,"a friendly sunshine pop vibe dances off this cd. completely pleasing. music can be fun, you know. and this is. each song a short slice of a smile on sound. did i forget to mention all the jangling guitars?"
2,Only one good song,"Before you crucify me for the title of this review, know that I love both ""Blinded by the Light"" and ""The Mighty Quinn."" However, the version of ""The Mighty Quinn"" on this CD is a really crummy live recording. I was really maddened by this, since nowhere on the cover does the word ""live"" appear. So for the presence of ""Blinded by the Light"" I'll spot this CD 2 stars, but with nothing else on it, that's all it gets."
3,Piano Classics,You didn't say anything about the fact that the music doesn't follow itself in a page by page order in this book. There are several songs where you have to skip a page in order to find the rest of the song!!! Hmmmm.!! Am glad it is usually only one page! J. Vinson
5,More accurate product description,"This two volume annual anthology of global terrorism and international security events and real-time analysis as written by some of the world's top terrorism analysts during the calendar year 2005. This book is designed as an invaluable reference, containing over 650 essays, which highlight and analyze global terrorism and international security issues augmented by proprietary perspectives and intelligence forecasts.Please note that this book is part of a two volume set, so to obtain the full 2005 report, add both volumes to your cart."
4,You Can Never Get Enough!!,"Another must-have album. Filled with tracks from ""A Thin Line Between Love & Hate"" & others. For any Zapp & Roger Troutman fan.At first I didn't know what to make of the album but after a while, it really grew on me. Even the Christmas track, which was the oddest of all.The only drawback was the amount of tracks!! I know 4 or 5 could've still been squeezed-in!! Oh... & the original ""California Love"" isn't good, lyrically."
5,ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!,"Le Monde Diplomatique wrote about this book""Poetic, mystical, metaphysical, humorous,erotic, erratic, this book is all (of that)....a complete portrait of India"". I totally agree!I found this book in a tiny bookstore in Ooty,Tamil Nadu in India and since then I've read itover and over again. It's an absolutely brilliantbook! A fantastically well written story and itonce changed my life"
5,"Thank you, Owen!","This Christmas album is a joy to listen to - it really gets you in the spirit of the season. Great to listen to while baking cookies, wrapping Christmas presents, and doing all those other Christmas prep chores. Also wonderful background music for a party. This was the best addition to my Christmas collection this year!"
2,Nice jar/ Spigot sucks,"The spigot is hard for people to figure out , some people turn it too far and the mechanism falls apart, when this happens you lose parts and all the beverage you have in the jar is lost / what a mess. The manufactures sell a turn handle spigot they soak you an extra 14.00 for. My question is why don't they just improve it with the turn handle spigot then sell it to you? Guess they need the extra 14.00 + shipping.Nice jar though. John"
3,No customer service,"Beware that there is no customer service...no phone and it takes several days before they get back to you. Not a problem unless you happen to need a question answered or have a problem with your order.Also, be careful. I received an email where they tried to get me to order directly through the company versus through Amazon (the problem here is that at least with amazon, they can step in, if necessary)"
4,Replying to another post,"To the person who was wanting to know what the song was playing when they went after the first storm, I believe it is Deep Purple's ""A 200"" from the ""Burn"" album. I think it is a live version, and I dont' know which album it comes from. The TV in Dusty's truck that you see when that song is playing, is showing footage of a Rainbow concert. There are obvious ties of course, and I have no idea if Rainbow ever recorded ""A 200""."
3,good enough,this cd is not so bad as i could expect it. there are some good songs and some horrible ones. but in the ned i would like to say:buy it! i'm sure u'll love ''moments like this'' or ''long way down''. good enough..believe me! anyway it's not the top but it could reach also 4 stars......
3,Can be more concise.,"In general, this is a fine book. It discussed the risks factors of developing antisocial behaviors. It also gives some ideas on the principles and best-practices of preventing or intervening antisocial behaviors. It is an academic textbook with lots of theory and data so is a good reference book for teachers. On the other hand, I feel the same messages are repeated over and over again, with different twists, that the best way to advert antisocial behaviors are two: (1) early prevention, and (2) comprehensive (meaning to involve as many people as possible.) I think the book can be shorter and perhaps less expensive."
2,Buy a more expensive one,"Though this potty is nicely priced, it's worth it to buy a more expensive one. Though mine hasn't fallen apart like other reviewers, it does shift around on the base, allowing for spillage. The removeable receptacle in the base is way too far from the actual seat, so my daughter gets stuff ALL OVER the inside, not just in the receptacle. The inside has a criss-crossed honeycomb type pattern(see my customer image)so it's impossible to clean messes out of it. It does serve it's purpose as a potty, but I'm definatly going to buy a different one when my son is old enough for one."
2,Not for Boys!!!!,The hole in the potty is WAY too small for boys learning to pee sitting down. It is not recommended to use the pee-guard by my pediatrician (too many boys injure themselves on them) so we don't. There is not enough room for him push it down to pee so I've had several messes to clean up on the the floor.I'm going out to get a new potty and will just use this one as a permanent step-stool.
2,not a good seat for boys,"We have been using this seat with our 2.5 year old son. The pee guard is detachable and I can't even count the number of times he's pulled it off (intentionally or accidentally) and it has landed IN the potty bowl (and its contents). To empty the bowl, you have to lift the top hinged seat up. Since I have a boy that pees against the potty guard, the pee then drips into the base of the seat (the stool part) which is divided into multiple little squares that pee gets trapped in. I have to take the whole potty into the shower and hose it down. All that to say, I wouldn't buy it again...especially for a boy!!!!"
2,Urine seeps into every crack and crevice causing an unholy stench.,"This thing stinks. Literally.In no time at all, your bathroom will smell like a truck-stop restroom. This thing has so many cracks and crevices, that any aim that isn't spot on leaks into the interior, where it dries and starts to stink. See those green handles? Well, they attach to the rest of the toilet through holes in the top. If your kid misses a little and pees on the seat, it runs into the handles holes and drips into the interior, where it pools in various chambers.As others have mentioned, the pee shield is worthless."
2,Is not doing what I expect it to.,"I took a chance after reading the mixed reviews and am sad to say I'm very disappointed with this unit. It just doesn't do what it's suppose to. I plug it in, the night light works, I feel a faint breeze but it does nothing to get rid of any bunny odor. When I clean the unit every few days there is a 'film' to be cleaned off, but I bought this unit to clean the air of bunny odor between litter box cleanings. Is not doing what I expect it to."
2,Worked well until it broke,"Loved this when I first got it, worked well in the small bathroom, made no noise which was nice. Noticed after about six weeks the light wasn't working - then opened it up to clean (cleaned it every week) and there was nothing on it - broken! Missed the return window, blah. Too much money to waste again, but so hard to find an ionic small purifier."
2,Bottle design is not good.,The top of bottle is flat and wide.That is incombinient when use.And the contents is a little bit watery. Need more viscosity.
1,It's not for me...,"This one was a little meh. Musk all over the place, and very little apple. There's a sharp peppery note at the end that I did not expect. It makes me cough. I will give this one away, not as a gift though. Just away to the first taker. Similiar to raid, and 409 carpet cleaner."
4,Very Useful and Easy to Follow,"Event Marketing explores the promotions industry. Though it is a textbook, Hoyle delightfully surprises the reader by writing in a witty style. Why intimidate or bore the reader when you can engage them? Hoyle takes this obvious, but overlooked, premise and runs with it as he explains the events promotions business.Like Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired, which also has case histories and strategies in how to promote events in a low-cost fashion, Hoyle seeks to turn a confusing and frantic arena into one that, like all other areas, is more easily understood once clear and discrete steps have been demonstrated. The personal examples at the end of each chapter only serve to add credibility and weight to Hoyle's words."
1,Another politically correct approach to higher education,"This is a book characteristic of the times of decadence we are in. Under almost every conclusion of the book is hidden the corporatism perspective concerning higher education and its destruction. As such, the book is yet another assault against the Enlightenment ideas orchestrated in the corridors of Harvard and welcomed by the corporatism establishment (it is no accident, after all, that Harvard University has such a huge endowment). The book's main suggestion: back to the pre-Enlightenment era. Sad, so sad."
4,A good book for model crafters,"This is a very good book for people who want to build boats from scratch. There are very good diagrams and pictures of finished products. I will try to make some of them and I think that the book will be a wonderful informative guide for that purpose.However, the title is ""Small RADIO CONTROL Boats"" and it falls sadly short in the area of Radio Control.I was hoping for more info on the electronics. I'm looking to learn more about the radio controls. In that way, I am rather disappointed."
1,Poor copy of a half hour TV show book promotion,"This is a copy a a TV show from Elmhurst, NY, in which the new book The Sutra of Complete Enlightenment is promoted by its author and Thich Nhat Hanh. I was very disappointed. Amazon graciously agreed to accept the return."
5,this album is consistent,"I couldn't say enough about this album or Lonesome Wyatt. He is the type of dude I would like to drink a beer with. This album is consistent, dark but yet peaceful."
2,It's okay for the price,Not too bad for a walkie talkie. Just do not use it in a Fair or any place that you know other people will also use their walkie talkies. Tends to pick up other people's signal.
3,"good value, but terrible on the slopes","For the money, these radios are great. good sound, range and form factor. However, everyone on the east coast must have been waiting for these cheaper radios to come out. I was riding at Sunday River this weekend, and there were some many other skiiers with this version, that every one of the 14 channels had a dozen people on it - with so many people asking where each other was, the radios were next to useless. if you're going to use these radios skiing, save up and buy the ones with private channels."
3,EH,"Overall, I like this product. I have tried it both inside and outside of the house and on the road. I guess I was hoping for a little more range out of it. They are pretty lightweight and the looks arn't bad. I couldn't quite get the 2 miles range that it says it has. I just wish Motorola would have spent a little more time on this. It could have been great."
5,GREAT but not AWESOME.,"I thought this was going to be the same wonderful interesting entertaining long-drive music just like the other FSOL albums. This is VERY DIFFERENT. It's not bad, but it takes getting used to. The first song is kind of a trick. It seems as if the album is going to be fun and full of dance-beats. Then it is sitar world. Then it is regular guitar music. BUT I CAN NOT live without song 3. It is similar to Fungus by Tones ON Tail. The songs remind you of other bands and voices you've heard your whole life. There is a BIT too much sitar, though. I have to give it five stars because it is a huge effort for FSOL and the songs are well done and I just plain love FSOL, so they can't do wrong."
2,fsol have lost the plot....,"If you are looking for a 60's/70's prog rock/world beat album, then this is the album for you.If you want the exquiste electronic textures and gorgeous liquid soundscapes and phat beats you have come to love fsol/amorphous androgynous for in the past, check out one of their past albums.With Papua New Guinea Translations and this album to folow it, they have officially lost me as a devoted follower.The boys dougans and cobain need to come down off their mountain and put the spliffs away and reconnect with what made them/their music so brilliant in the past. Which was innovation and breaking new ground.Yes this is definitely new ground(for them at least) but something the beatles, pink floyd and gong did a long time ago and did much better.I highly recommend Tales of Ephiderena(their other release as ""amorphous androgynous"") and ""Lifeforms"" but don't waste your cash on this disappointment."
2,Identity crisis,"2 1/2Trades futuristic jungle soundscapes for song-based retro psychedelia to somewhat (with exception to few incisively implemented, Indian influenced, instrumental interludes) detrimental effect even after initial confusion subsides."
4,FSOL reborn.... in the 70's?,"You can't help but admire FSOL for their past influences on the world of organic electronica, and expression in general. This album comes as a bit of a surprise to loyal fans or anyone vaguely familiar with their stylings. It seems that Cobain and Dougans have fallen into a state of mind expanded bliss ... ( take that how you will) ....... In a nutshell, I'd say they took a trip to the 70's and lost their keys. I'm expecting them to come to my door at any minute to preach their beliefs.... Buy this album with an open mind and expect to take a well produced trip.........."
2,McAfee has forgotten how to write software,"I've used McAfee for years, and liked it better than Norton. However, Version 8 is an absurd step backwards. Unlike previous versions (and all other virus scanners I've seen) you cannot configure automatic scans to not scan network drives or specific directories. There doesn't seem to be a log of what was scanned so there's no way to check what has happened. The script blocker doesn't have any mechanism to specify some scripts as ok to run.Overall this is pretty ridiculous release."
4,Great Leggings!,"I wear tons of leggings, especially in the winter. I finally decided to spend some money on a pair after getting sick of cheap leggings that become see-through and stained after only a few wears. I am really happy with these leggings, and will be purchasing another pair. They are made of great material, so they simultaneously suck it all in and are opaque! The material doubles up in the crotch area, which is a nice element. I've been hang-drying mine, and they have held up much better than the cheaper leggings I've previously purchased. I would highly recommend these for anyone looking for a solid pair of leggings, either for workout use, or to wear with boots in the winter."
4,The Future,This video was very informative and makes you realize that if the US doesn't turn back to God it is doomed.
5,REPENT BEFORE THE RETURN OF THE LORD!,"I really loved it. It is so amazingly accurate with Scriptures, it could not possibly be fabricated by a very vivid imagination.I would recommend it to both believers and unbelievers of the Word of God.The core message is REPENT AND TURN AWAY FROM YOUR EVIL WAYS. Isn't that the truth?PINA FABRI"
4,Fiction or not,"Even if you don't believe what is discussed in this video and see it as fiction it should make you at least think. Its worth watching and discussing. Just be warned that once you watch it you can't claim ignorance when ""events"" continue to happen."
1,I got the book first which was great,but these 2 DVD left a lot to be desired. Was not happy with the contentI would recommend against these dvd's as if I had seen these first would never have bought them.fredoftampa@gmail.com
5,Amazing beyond description!,It is astounding how that two nations (USA and Israel) that God was at the base of their foundation and hope of existance is aligned together in God's pattern of judgment.It is a must see movie that will forever change your view of what's ahead.
4,Isaiah 9:10 Judgment,"This video was a must see for anyone who believes in the God of the Bible. Jonathan Cahn sites his sources accurately. He makes the case that the U.S. is under God's Judgment, and calls the Nation to repent and return to God."
3,Why is it RED?,"The quality was very nice, but unlike the picture the color was not maroon it was more RED."
5,Haba Nelly 12' soft doll,My daughter carried around her soft Haba doll for years. Now she is a mom and we got her two year old daughter one for her birthday. She loves it!
5,Debbie Allen has produced and promoted a gem!,"Debbie Allen's latest book is packed with suggestions for single, separated or searching souls wanting to fulfill those needs for new relationships. Debbie and her many contributors present personal views that give this book a unique flavor for dating potentials on which to feast.Humor is also included in this uplifting, informative and inspirational book. Read Joni Newman's input on pages 45 to 50. You'll have a good laugh. Okay, I Shamelessly Confess; I wrote them!Put this book at the top of your list for anyone who needs that gentle shove into the dating world.

5,In Search History: Abominable Snowman,"Great documentary! The skeptical scientist in the film, the middle aged woman, spectacled one, was annoying, but it's helpful to have dubious people about nature's mysteries, so the debates continue. Does bigfoot have a cousin in the Himalayas?"
2,OK if you're about 12 years old...,"My nephew got these for his birthday, and I couldn't help grimacing as he cranked up the volume while showing them off to me. Shrill and harsh with very thin midrange and muddy boomy bass---though I suppose if you're twelve years old it sounds better than a lousy little boombox.It's too bad his parents didn't ask me for advice before buying these, for a hundred bucks you can get a much better speaker like the Polk R15 or especially the Fluance SV-6 (fluance dot com).Sony, Kenwood, JVC, Panasonic, Pioneer---these are big names mainly because they spend a lot of money on advertising which is what you the consumer end up paying for rather than actual quality components or R&D.; Their electronics are OK (the Pioneer is the best of the bunch) at the lowest end of the market but their speakers are fairly dismal.My advice is, buy speakers from a company that makes only speakers, and buy a subwoofer from a company that makes only subwoofers!"
3,"The primise of the book is good, but it missed the mark for me.","I read the book for a Bible study I was part of at Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, Texas. I had breakfast as part of a group of men with the author Lloyd Reeb.The book attempts to show how regular people can add significance to the second half of their lives. He atempts to show how persons before achieving financial freedom and without leaving their career can find significance. He strives to show you don't have to be rich to find a life of significance. It in somes ways attempts to answer the question, ""Is that all their is?"" He attempts to help you tie meaning to your work and/or ministry to you work. I was disappointed in the examples used in the book. They tended to be examples of persons who were upper middle-class, business owners etc., instead of what I view would be ordinary people. The primise of the book is good, but it missed the mark for me.Read and reviewed by Jimmie A. Kepler"
4,A Woman With the Blues (for sure),"Way back in 1967 I was turned on to the first track ""Down So Low"", and it has remained in my head all these years.Now that I have the albumn, I realize there are at least a few songs that have received some attention, with which others may be familiar, even though ""Down So Low"" was not ever a mainstream hit.I highly recommend this albumn for anyone who knows (and feels the desire to wallow, from time to time, in) the blues set to music by this accomplished singer and pianist."
5,still great after all these years,"Saw Tracy Nelson (7/01) a few days ago at the Bluebird Cafe, Nashville......a taping which should be on Turner South sometime in December 2001. Her voice seems unchanged by the years and she still has a very rich and full sound which eclipses almost all current female performers. Blusey and country the CD captures her fairly well it's too bad Living with the Animals is missing from the selections"
3,Not exactly Living with the Animals,"Here is a lovely taste of Mother Earth, deservedly focusing on their terrific lead singer Tracy Nelson. A morsel worth having if only for the few tracks taken from their seminal ""Living with the Animals"" album, which should have been re-released on CD long ago. This is the work that catapulted Mother Earth into the forefront of folk/rock stardom ..."
3,"One word, Underwhelming",Not much to note here. Worth watching but barely. I would have been upset if I had paid to see it in the theater.
2,Feels like a made-for-TV movie,"The positive reviews here are scarier than the movie. This felt like a made-for-TV/cable/video movie. Everything about it felt so ordinary, especially the poor script. The ending was abrupt and cheaply feel-good. And to strive for that PG-13 rating, there was the one stupid joke one guy says about bending over some chick. Cheap and bad B movie with a high budget. What a waste of a Saturday night. I lost a fraction of an IQ point, I think. Hollywood--quit insulting us!"
5,"Scared me, made me think","It's a horror movie with a moral message. It was well written, well acted, and suspenseful. The only thing I could have done without was being told what was about to happen, why something was happening, etc. However, that narration didn't hinder my enjoyment of the film. I have nightmares about elevators, so those of you who have seen it should know why it scared a few tears out of me. I like a movie that is creepy and has a little bit of a twist. What I really liked was that the makers of the movie knew that they didn't need huge, overdone, wild special effects to make it scary. They put into practice what John Carpenter did best; they kept it clean, it made sense, it was believable, and they made the viewer feel vulnerable."
2,Locked room mystery with a supernatural twist,"This is one of those films that could have been interesting with a bit more subtlety but instead falls flat on its face.It starts as a basic locked room mystery. Five strangers are trapped in a stuck elevator and one by one they are killed off.But M Night Shyamalan gave it a supernatural twist which makes it hard to get into the mystery and then, even worse, gave away the twist in the TITLE!It could have been worse, it could have been called 'Elevator Murders: The Devil Did It'. But not much worse.It would have made for a decent Twilight Zone or Tales from the Darkside episode but really the plot is not enough to fill a 2 hour movie."
2,"Could have been a cheap, TV movie","There really wasn't much psychological torture at all in this movie. There was even lesser physical torture in this movie. So what are we left with? - -Not much really. The characters trapped in the elevator are unlikeable; each are irritating and annoying, so why do I care if they die or not. I really needed something more to sink my teeth into; a better, deeper plot, more in-depth characters, and better story telling. This just seems like a cheap, crappy, movie night rental."
3,"five people are trapped in an elevator,and they are not alone (3.5/5)","i really liked this movie.the suspense builds nicely.there's a very tense atmosphere.you never know what going to happen next or who is ultimately responsible,until close to the end,which i didn't see coming.the acting is really good here,as is the direction.M. Night Shyamalan produced the film,but did not direct it.the story moves along at a good even pace.even the dialogue was pretty decent.i liked the fact that each of the characters had their own unique story.i found the movie quite compelling.i liked the fact that the motive for everything that happens in the film isn't revealed right off the bat,so you have to try to figure it out yourself.for me,Devil is a 3.5/5"
3,Who were the people?,"This film had the potential to be great. However it lacked one key element I never got emotionally involved with the characters. Who was the jumper and why? Where were the momentary flashbacks of each persons sins so I could choose which one I disliked more? No self description in the elevator so I could pity one more than the other. I felt nothing for any of them when they were in the elevator until the end with the one member but by then it was too late to care. (I really wanted to hope and cheer for someone but could not) What I did not get in fright I also did not get in emotion, too bad if they had coupled it right it would have been great instead of thin."
1,Defective,Recieved the blu ray for Xmas. Amazon sold a defective digital copy that expired back on 5/2011!!! Make sure the digital copy is VALID!
5,The Banjo-Kazooie guide book helped me a lot with the game.,"This book helped me find hidden banjo statues, jiggies, jinjos, etc. it's a great book for beginners. if you purchase this book you'll probably find it's very helpful. It's basicly just a book that will help you help them on their quest to save tootie."
1,Connecticut ??? What Happened.,"I actually own this cd and if it wasn't for atleast 2 tracks on it I would throw it in the trash. I know I can copy it then sell the original,.. but I prefer to have the original plus I wouldn't want to put any one to the pain of owning this poorly made CD.... If you don't have well guess what your not missing anything much at all."
4,Perfect for unusual RPGs,"I got these because Fudge RPG dice, D6 averaging dice other unusual dice are so hard to come by, or are just plain expensive. With these though, you can place whatever numbers or symbols you need for your game on the stickers and change them if you need to with inexpensive stickers."
1,Sleeping Pill,"This album is just great... FOR INSOMNIACS! If you don't understand Italian (and maybe even if you do...) it will put you to sleep right away!Has anyone else noticed how Air albums are going downhill? Since the ""Virgin Suicides"" the quality of their music is horribly deteriorating from one album to the next. I bought the last three Air albums (including this one) without even listening to them- because it's Air. What a MISTAKE!This is THE WORST AIR ALBUM EVER."
2,Bizarre cooperative album with an Italian novelist,"I love almost everything Air has ever produced. The exceptionalMoon Safariis one of my favorite albums ever. However, this one just didn't do it for me.First, the music itself is very atmospheric, which is usually a good thing, and a huge part of what Air has always been about. Unfortunately, I can't really get into the music because I am so distracted by the voice reading in Italian that dominates the music and strangles it to death. If I understood Italian, perhaps I wouldn't feel this way, but I don't.This is an album to purchase if:1. You are a completist Air fan and want to own every album they ever released.2. You speak Italian and enjoy the work of Alessandro Baricco.If you're like me and like your Air without distracting narrative being read in a foreign language, take a pass on this one."
3,Powerful Documentary of a Controversial Topic,"With a topic of intense controversy, it's a good documentary if you can't tell who made it. This is, by that definition, a good documentary.As you probably know, Christian fundamentalists are indeed waiting for Armegeddon. Maybe even eagerly. And, some would argue, trying to bring it on. That's what this movie is about. But it's also about how Israel is used by them to promote their own agenda, including the money they can make leading tours of ""The Holy Land,"" writing books and organizing conferences, all that.A variety of voices are heard, but the emphasis seems to be on believers. That's one reason it's hard to tell who produced it. Ultimately, the fact that other voices, reasonable ones, are included makes it clear this was not created by a fundamentalist.I'll let you watch for the credits at the end, like I did."
1,not good,"I didn't think this book was as good as Ella Enchanted. I don't think you should write a sequal to someone else's book. In Ella Enchanted, Gail Carson Levine finished the book, so there was no need for a sequal. In Just Ella, Margaret Haddix changed the story totally. She changed too many things to make the book good. Margaret Haddix, first of all, read the book you're writing the sequal to and don't change things. Second of all, if you wanted to change the book so much, just write a whole new one. I would not recommend this book. However, I would recommend Ella Enchanted. I give Ella Enchanted 5 stars."
4,Just Ella Review,I love the book!! i have not read any other Margaret Peterson Haddix books but I would like to in the near future. My favourite part is when Ella runs away. The only problem I have with the book is that it is a little too Cinderella. I recomend the book to anyone doing a report as it is easy to do one on or anyone who is looking for a light read. The book does leave you hanging at the end on wether or not she and the other man get married. If you cannot stand that kind of book DO NOT read Just Ella.
1,Too Unbelievable,"I waited and waited for this book since I like Margaret Peterson Haddix as an author. But Ella came across as really snotty, the prince and his family came across as too stupid and the idea of the refugee camp seemed way too far fetched! I just kept on saying ""Oh brother!"" and shaking my head throughout the novel. If the book had been placed in a contemporary setting then I may have liked the story. The love story part of the novel was sweet, but on the whole it did not work in my opinion."
4,Just Ella-,I liked this book because of all the neat emotions you got to read about of all the characters. It is also great because of all the different challenges Ella had presented to her. I hope you read this book!
3,Destroys fairytale magic,"This book was fine. When I first began to read it, I was hooked. But as it neared the end, Ella is tied up, drugged, imprisoned, and torchered...Let's just say tha it gets annoying, depressing, and very, VERY predictable.Come ON, Peterson Haddix! Enough with the whining and wondering "" Is it just me or the prince really a senseless airhead?"" In the end, this book is gross and unworthwhile. I will have to admit though, It isn't half as bad as some of the other reviews suggest."
2,A poor retelling,"I enjoy reading various versions of traditional fairy tales, from different cultures or with modern twists, and Cinderella is my favorite. But this rendering is too far off from the usual tale and loses the magic (the storytelling magic, that is - you CAN tell Cinderella successfully without fairy magic, such as in ""Ever After""). While it was a reasonably interesting read, it was not Cinderella, and should not be compared with other versions such as ""Ella Enchanted."" Indeed, Levine has much more skill with a fairy tale than does Haddix."
4,Happily Never After,"Just Ella is a retelling of the classic story Cinderella . . . with a twist. There's no fairy godmother, despite what you might of heard, Prince Charming isn't charming, just dumb and try's to play the hero, and her bedroom is a dungeon for part of the book, not a luxorious tower in the castle.Just Ella is a good read but sometimes seems to wander out of the time period and is sometimes a bit predictable. It's a very interesting story and makes you think about how cheezy some fairy tales really are. A good thing is that you never find yourself bored when reading it and that it has a happy ending.Just Ella is a book worth reading, but it isn't the best retelling of a fairy tale out there. I gave it four stars because some of the characters seem in different time periods and because it can be a bit predictable at times.10+85/100Recomendtations: Ella Enchanted"
4,With a twist in the middle.,"It's about a girl name Ella. Her stepmother prefers Ella as a servant than a stepdaughter. She wanted to go to the ball, but her stepmother wouldn't let her go. She turned out going anyway. She found her mother's dress. The dress was perfect for the ball. And got glass shoes from a person that says that he could make anything. When she got to the ball she finally met the prince. They loved each other. Until she wasn't sure at all if he really loved her. Then she refuses to marry with Prince Charming. She turned out to be in the dungeon, till she says that she will marry the prince. She found a way how to escape from the dungeon. She made a hole. Then she escaped. To find her friend, Jed. Then when she found him. He asked her to marry him. But she didn't want to marry him yet, and he can ask her later in 6 months. Ella is a heroine person. To escape from the dungeon. It turns out in the ending that one of her stepsister married the prince."
4,"Demon's, Computer's, and Chat rooms oh my!","A twisted web of deceit of global proportion. How far will people go to make a profit. This book captured me by page 3 and had me stunned mid way. The character's are easy to identify with and the demon is very real. We all have a sense of right and wrong; which side will you choose. Three hero's fighting against one Demon with upper management and every computer turned on at his disposal. He will come at you with instant messages, he will find you in a chatroom, he will touch you in the cyber world and he can kill you from out of thin air! The plot has many turns and the ending will terrify you with what could come to pass. If you like terror, suspense and want to root for the good guy, this is your book- buy it."
4,We'll all be going back to this one...,"for decades to come, whenever we look at the development of the Royal Navy. It is an excellent book in so many ways. But I have to echo an earlier reviewer who was miffed by the politics of the book. Reading it, one is struck by how the author sees certain things. For him, beating and flogging people was, well, understandable, and kidnapping via the Press Gang was, just necessary, and the judicial murder of Admiral Byng was, well, justified, because the ends justify the means, and his execution did put some life into those admirals, didn't it? If the author is not a pure reactionary, he is certainly utterly amoral in his approach to the past. Perhaps that is acceptable to some, but for this military historian, such an approach does not pass muster. Nevertheless, this is a great work of research and synthesis, essential reading for any student of the era, naval historian or not."
5,There is a God.,"Enya's music may be heard by some as celestial, after hearing this collection of songs, some may change their minds. Moyet's voice is out in front, albeit the music's playing, one's ears don't bend to that noise. I liken the ""music"" on this disc to the gold band that holds the flawless diamond in place. This is true nirvana: Thank you God."
2,I'm being generous with 2 Stars,What CD were the other reviewers listening to? As a fan of Alf's since the Yazoo days - every release of hers is a must for these ears....however I was cringeing at this poorly produced mish mash of standards. Someone wrote that this was finally a showcase for her voice...these cuts are so unemotive and flat I could not disagree more. Listen to her soaring vocals on ESSEX or RAINDANCING and you can fathom the incredible vocal prowess of this very underrated singer. I don't understand one reason why this recording was released. Perhaps she needed to finish a contract. Horrible disappointed.
4,This Album's Anonimity Is A Crime,"If any aging icon has the inherent right to perform standards, old and newer, it is the impeccable exquisiteness of Moyet's rich and dense texture. Her manly, brooding alto brings deep, nascent understanding of the oft-recorded lyrics; it's almost as if she were borne to sing these. Her `Windmills Of My Mind' is clearly one of the most brilliant takes of this song ever recorded. The rest are deliberately paced, slow-burning and permeated with sense and sensuality. While Rod Stewart continues raping the standards canon with his queasy grasp at quasi-relevance, I'll bask in the glow of Moyet. My grade: A"
1,Fail,"Worked great for about 2 weeks then quit completely. Thought batteries died so replaced them, still didnt work. I'm gonna send it back but havent gotten around to it yet."
1,Save your money,This cd blows. the only good song on this cd is there cover ofNORDIC THUNDER'S Runnin Riot.
4,A Pictoral Review of Signs,"This is, as its title suggests, an expansive collection of pictoral signs primarily from European sources. The signs are beautifully reproduced, but if you are looking for comprehensive genealogies of the signifiers, you should probably look elsewhere. This book has 493 well-reproduced signs, but their histories are minimally documented without any source/ primary documentation of their origins. The signs are described in short, declarative sentences which readers curious about the meaning of the signs might find discomforting. The research here is not without merit or credibility, but the book is for readers interested in signs for their visual grandeur rather than their significance. An interesting and affordable introduction to signs."
3,Informative But Basic and Inaccurate,"Outstanding in scope but inaccurate in places. For example, the pictoral representation of the Svastika is actually a Sauvastika. The difference is slight from a pictoral sense but major in meaning. A Sauvastika is a sign for magic, night, and destiny while the Svastika is a sign for prosperity, and good fortune. From a pictoral standpoint the difference is, a Svastika is a clockwise swirl like two letter s while the Sauvastika is counterclockwise like two letter z. Personally I believe that continuing research into signs remains important if nothing but to prevent people like Adolf Hitler hijacking good luck, prosperity and religous symbols. I loved this book and on a basic level it covers a wide range of symbols and meanings. In fact if it weren't for slight inaccuracies I would have given it all 5 stars."
4,No VibraCall alert feature,"I bought the Nordic Blue version of the T6200 a month ago. I'm satisfied with the performance. Although I'm a bit disappointed that the T6200 actually doesn't have the Vibracall function (it says in the manual that only the T6210 and T6220 have it). It was actually one of the main reasons why I chose to buy this model over the T5420. I hope ... would revise it's editorial review and omit this VibraCall alert feature so as not to mislead prospective buyers. Overall, it is a great buy though."
3,the cd diggin' the crates vol 3:for the old school beat,"hello,amazon. il chose this rating for that music thats on this cd,some of the other songs i didnt like.but overall i like this cd!thank youmanuel grassimanuel.grassi@live.nl"
5,Great Scope!,"I'm a relative beginner, and so far have found this scope to be great. Previous comments have mentioned flimsy tripod (almost prevented me from ordering it), but I don't find this to be the case. I bought an adapter separately - battery life is OK but not exceptional. Computer occasionally has a glitch when finding objects, otherwise exceptional scope."
5,recommendation by a seminary president,"Islam and the Jews is a ""MUST READ""book for every person really interested in the battle between the Jews and Muslins. Dr. Gabriel treats the subject with academic soundness, theological truth and Biblical clarity. Our Bible college and seminary uses this book extensively in the training of pastors and Bible students the TRUTH about Islam's intentions for the Jewish people.May GOD through His Holy Spirit use this book to give Divine understanding of the issues discussed in this wonderful treatise. ""BE WARNED"" you will NEVER look at Islam and the Jews in the same light again after reading this masterpiece ""Islam and the Jews"". Dr. Gene A. Youngblood, President of CONSERVATIVE THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY"
3,The tamer side of brilliance,"3 1/2The great modern progressive Jazz pianist has many in this series, and his first trio document may very well be his weakest, but only when you consider that slow, traditionally-executed ballads are front and center here, with Mehldau exercising more restraint then usual. Make no mistake though, the disc does contain a few contrasting up-tempo highlights and enough informed interplay to warrant examination."
3,I'd rather learn from an ape.,"I read Ishmail in about a day and a half and couldn't wait to read this continuation. I was very dissapointed in the story and how it was presented. The style used in both the Ishmail books is very easy to read and also makes for a ""quick"" read. This book does not flow as well, and I don't think that the message is nearly as powerful. I would rather be preached to by an ape than a down on his luck priest."
4,"Gripping view of our ""Taker"" status on Earth...a wake-up call!","Once again Daniel Quinn baffles and intrigues me with his maieutic method of conveying cutting edge ideas woven into an exciting mystery novel...no spoilers here, but the question remains, per Quinn's challenge to the ""Taker"" vision: was the world was made for Man, and was Man made to conquer and rule it? I love B's passion and commitment to living a different kind of life...enough said."
1,"preaching taken to a new low, by the writing style","the writing style simply cannot support the ideas in this manifesto. Eloquence is essential to delivery of the any message, and the 'B'(s) endlessly wordy messages seemed to dull the senses of most listeners, including the priest. Using the excuse that our message is so revolutionary that it cannot be described to the average person in a simple way is, at best, poor writing. At its worst, the whole thing may simply be a bad idea. If you want to feel like you were just run over by a bus, you may enjoy reading this book. If you are searching for meaning in life, it would be better to look elsewhere."
1,danger,"This book was powerful and unsatifsying, sort of like a diet of Big Macs. Quinn has hold of some interesting ideas, but he never supports any of them with data or even fleshed-out discussion. Occasionally he'll put in a list of, for example, ancient civiliazations, as though that constituted a rational argument for his position (for which many rational arguments could have been summoned had he cared to write them).I had to go read The Eye of the Spirit by Ken Wilber to get the taste of all that grease out of my mouth. For, in other words, some real intellectual sustenance. I find writers like Quinn dangerous in exactly the same way Big Macs are dangerous: a quick sampling is intoxicating, but over the long haul, you'll starve to death trying to live on them."
4,Thought Provoking,"I don't agree with all his assumptions, but combined with his prequel ""Ishmael"" it makes you think about important aspects of sustainability. It's a must read."
4,Read it!,"I read the Quinn's trilogy and found Ishmael to be the best of all. The Story of B is thought-provoking and brings forth many interesting ideas and makes intelligent arguments. It would be unfair to compare it with Ishmael. If you have read Ishmael, then it would be hard to satisfy your highest expectations.The Story of B is the natural sequel for Ishmael. I would recommend it to all Quinn readers."
1,"Ridiculous, unpleasant","Unreadable. I skipped most of it. The female protagonist is unable to speak or possibly hear, yet somehow supposedly learns to communicate with the hero after a lot of uproar that I simply could not tolerate. These books are cents less expensive than used-bookstore copies, but be prepared for them to be thoroughly stained (with new-looking covers which may be falling off.)"
2,Disappointed,"After reading Comanche Moon I couldn't wait to read another book by CA. I picked this one because of the reviews given on this site. I was sorely left depleted. I came to dislike Annie. I found her extremely naive and it really started getting on my nerves. I found her child like qualities totally disagreeable. The author had no problem having her act like a woman when she needed too. But, after going through 9 months pf pregnancy and delivering her baby she believed that the baby was put inside of her by a fairy. After that, I kicked myself for reading that much of the book. And Alex was a whimp. I found his immediate attraction to who he believed at the time to be a moron utterly disgusting. Save your money."
3,3.5 STAR,"VERY EMOTIONAL BOOK FOR ME, I HAVE NEVER READ A BOOK WHERE I FELTTOTALLY & EMOTIONALLY WRUNG OUT. THERE WAS UNBELIEVABLE SADNESS AND PAIN, I LAUGHED,CRIED AND WAS AN ABSOLUTE WRECK ALL THROUGHOUT THIS BOOK. GOES TO SHOW SHE MS ANDERSON HAS GREAT WRITING SKILLS. ONLY GAVE IT 3.5 STARS AS THE BOOK LEFT ME WITHA FEELING OF SADNESS.A VERY STRONG RIVERTING READ."
4,Intricacies of the Court in GREAT detail,"Only embark upon this book if you truly want to understand the complexities of exactly how the federal courts chose their cases. It is not for a light read or a brief introductory summary, but instead a painstankingly detailed analyzation of the Courts' precident and applications through theory. Very concisely and percisely worded but a consuming read."
2,Disappointed,"I wasn't nearly as thrilled with this book as some of the folks whose reviews influenced me to buy it. If you know anything about the functional anatomy of sensation/pain and/or psychology of pain, it's not for you; you won't get anything new. If you're newly diagnosed with a chronic pain syndrome, and don't have a background in any of the above, yes, it might be helpful."
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this product because I absolutely love Thai food and wanted to make it at home. This did not taste like the Pad Thai I am used to. I have eaten at many different Thai restaurants in the Washington DC area and this doesn't come close to their Pad Thai sauce. Now, I have never been to Thailand, so maybe this is what ""authentic"" pad thai tastes like, but I did not like it and neither did anyone in my family. Very disappointing."
1,This version blows,"I'm a HUGE Santana fan and I think this version of the song with Alex Band is a joke. If you want to hear this song in top form, buy ""Shaman"" and listen to it featuring Chad Kroeger"
3,Alex sings it NOT Chad,"This is not Chad Kroeger singing this song. It is Alex band from the calling. I love nickelback to death and yes at first I thought it was him too, but it is not. I was actually dissapointed when i found out it wasn't chad, but alex does do a fantastic job singing this song."
2,Not what I expected,"I've been doing workouts on my Wii Fit and was hoping to try a new exercise routine. Maybe I'm not coordinated enough for a dancing workout. Either way, it's hard to follow along since Bethany fails to carefully break down the moves. Some of the moves were too confusing and ran together with other moves. I got frustrated and turned it off. Everyone has their own style and preference... this one just wasn't for me."
4,"Intermediate workout, fun & fast!","I did this for the first time today, and found it really fun. I broke a decent sweat, and learned some new dance moves. It's not super cheesy like a lot of the other dance workouts, and the instructor is clear, concise, and enjoyable to follow. The first time you do this, definitely watch the intro where she breaks down the dance steps. Some are more challenging than others, but by the end of it, I almost had all the moves right. I've been doing a lot of Core Fusion dvds (Body Sculpt and Cardio Pure Intensity) and it's nice to mix in this easier, intermediate workout. I get my heart pumping but don't feel like I'm gonna pass out like I do sometimes with Core Fusion stuff. Lastly, a dance workout--could it feel any less like a workout? No way!"
2,A Reader,"I have to say this book will work for those who are searching for some type of spirituality. However, there are correct ways of doing things in tribal structures and many practioners don't have the ""right"" to do so and often distort the practices. In answer to Prof. Carroll, Mr. Storm is indeed both N.Cheyenne and German-American."
2,I just didn't like the LADY who is staring,"My friend loves the Prime Suspect....I don't.I like Foyles War but also didn't like the episode where the man stole theladies jewels after the bombs were dropped....It was done very well, but it just turned me off..."
4,Hawkeye depth sounder,This is a good unit. The bold readout is a big improvement over most of the competition. It works well at faster speeds ( as advertised).I replaced a Humminbird that was a real headache!Go for it!
3,Iced Out,"This is one album that I really didnt understand.The so called ""king of breaks"" can really come up with some strange stuff,thats a sho nuff.Let me recommend his ""Essential Mix""to any dance fan,and unless you are a die hard Icey fan,I wouldnt buy this"
5,Mellifluous Groove Box,"Magnificent Remixes of an Album (Last Century Modern) which I will soon be purchasing. For anyone who has even the remotest amount of respect for quality musicianship, check out the Butterfly remix (track 2) for an impressive display of syncopated rhythm.Peace."
3,Interesting,"This book is not an easy read, but it does contain some interesting information that makes it worth buying and reading. If you are into conspiracy theory it is a must have."
5,Exactly what I wanted!!,"I ordered this bottle opener on Tuesday, & I received it that following Saturday.....I'm a bartender and my co-workers loved it....fast shipping!!"
4,"Listen to Them, they are good","I've been listening to Rustic Overtones since 1996, and they've gotten better with time. This cd by them was a true labor of love, taking 3 years to get released as the band dealt with legal and contractual issues, finally getting off of Arista and on to Tommy Boy. Stand out tracks include Sector Z, Combustible, and Hardest Way Possible. Good Cd, support good music and buy it."
2,Another Glossy Collection Of Re-Records,"Yawn. Not the original ""hit"" recordings (although many of these songs were not close to being hits). These are slick, glossy re-recordings, many not even by the original artist.Mind you, these aren't bad ... but they're not great, either. If you know and love -- or even appreciate -- the original recordings, then keep moving on. These ain't for you.If you like the versions here, then go for it. Just don't be disappointed when you hear (in several cases) the superior original recording."
3,"hard to find in stores,so i bought it online.","the scent does not last very long.in enclosed areas it works fine.geat for use in your car,for a short period."
2,didn't last long,"scent faded quickly, didn't even last 2 weeks.wanted a product that lasted much longer. scent was stronger when all were packed in box together"
2,"Interesting, but not what the title promised !!!","1001 Ways To Beat The Draft is very small booklet with the advices such as:Become a Senator,Become a President,Etc.In order to beat the draft.In some ways the advices are funny but usually not very practical. Buy this booklet for less than 5$, but do not expect too much."
5,It's a great songs,It's was a wonderful songs from each of them. I always play with that music all the time. All of the songs really does touched my heart and able to understand what CeCe was singing.
1,Simply Beautiful Sweaters,"They should have named this book Simply Simple Sweaters. I picked up a copy at my local library(to test-read), and Boy am I glad I did. I would have been furious to spend the Big bucks for a little book. As an experienced knitter who enjoys technique and texture in knitting, not to mention fine gauges and small needles, I found nothing ""knitable"" in the book. However if you like large needles and heavier weight yarns, this may be the book for you. Basic(wearable) styles,easy knitting(not much shaping) and fast results are all you will find in this book. All in all the book seems terribly overpriced to me."
3,Razor E100,Product is very easy to assemble. I would recommend the next up model for speed and for ease of use by a child. On the E100 you have to get it to 3MPH before the motor will start up once its started it is not very fast and has a solid rear rubber wheel compared to the air wheels on the next up model. If you do not charge for the 18 hours it doesn't last very long on first charge.
4,Great scooter BUT...,The chain guard keeps hitting the ground when you turn right... it is a little annoying! Other that that it is a fast little scooter!
1,Short lived,"Purchased for my daughter in February for her bday. She was able to ride April-June when it stopped working. Ordered batteries from Amazon per site recommendations, they came with an F2 connecter but it needs an F1. Need to return ($50 value). Had to purchase locally for $54 only to find hte issue is not the batteries. With new batteries fully charged the electric motor does not engage. Very disappointing for my daughter!"
4,Kids love this product,The kids love this product. It is a huge hit. I bought two of them one for my 8 year old and one for my 12 year old. It is hard to get them off the scooters until the batteries run down. We have had for about a month and no problems so far. The battery lasts about 20-25 minutes.
3,It's a fun toy!,"My kids like the new electric scooters. However, they have alot more fun riding them with friends on the sidewalks around the neighborhood. I would share with other parents that are friends with your kids. Kids don't really ride them when they're friends aren't around. Every kid that see's there scooter wants to ride them! Fun, durable, but they do take awhile to charge up and worth it!"
4,Great but the on/off switch broke,"My son who is 8 loved his scooter until the on/off switch snapped and scooter no longer works. I'm considering getting another one maybe a 200 or 300, but have not decided yet."
1,Razor E100 Terrible Support,We had a new Razor E100 electric scooter and it would not turn on. So I did like the product said and called Razor. The ship me a new on/off switch. After getting the part with no instructions I called them back and spoke with somebody that did not speak English. He was unhelpful and told me to take the scooter to a Lawn mower repair shop to get them to fix it. I told him to jump in the lake and asked to ship it back to them. He told me I would have to send it back to Amazon. Anyway it was a terrible experience.
1,Poorly made,"I purchased the E100 Electric Scooter for my son in December. He got to use it a handful of times and then he got too close to the curb and the on/off switch broke off. It is in a bad location on the underbelly of the scooter. I tried to replace it and it melted out the wires to the starter. Customer service was great at Razor, and sent me several parts to repair it, but after finally receiveing them and finding a shop that would repair it, we found out that they sent the wrong parts. Since then I haven't been able to even stay on hold long enough to talk to anyone at the company again. In the mean time I got another one on E-bay that said it was barely used and once I received it, it never charged! My son loved it while it worked and keeps asking me for another one, but I am hesitant to spend the money for the third time just to have him be disappointed again."
4,Great... but expensive,"I got this scooter for my son and he loves it. It has great battery life and it goes pretty fast too.After I got it though, I realized that it is very over priced.Here is a link to a less expensive site: [...]"
2,Disappointed,"I was very excited when I purchased this item as a gift for my niece. However, I'm very disappointed that the item does not function as desired, expected or anticipated. It was intended to be a motorized equipment but despite charging as recommended, scooter does not function as a motorized scooter. I'm very very disappointed. I can't express my dissappointment enough and my niece was so excited when she received it but after writing 2 days for the charge, excitement vanished.I actually bought 2, the other will be given this month as another gift. I hope this one won't be as disappointing and this one will actually work. It's too much trouble to return and maybe will not purchase again."
5,Perfect for our 10 yr old daughter!!!,She can't get enough of this scooter.Easy to put together (she did it herself).Even though it only goes 10 mph it feels like it goes faster.It runs for about a hour fully charged.
4,My granddaughter loves it,It is a great scooter for a 9 year old. Wish there was some way to tell when the battery needs to be charged when she and her friends are using it.
5,Razor E1-- Electric Scooter,"Bought two of these for Christmas gifts for my grandsons - this was enjoyed all day long by kids and 'big kids' alike! Very durable, easy to assemble - only two pieces! Holds a charge well and works on smooth or gravel surfaces."
5,Worth the money.,"This was a Christmas gift. The kiddo loves it and it seems to be holding up to her abuse. It's got some good speed to it, but not too much that you'll be making a trip to the nearest emergency room. It only took her a couple of tries to get good at it (and she is a bit clumsy). I think this would be the kind of thing any kid would love (and smaller adults)."
2,did not function,the scooter E 100 did not work at all so I read other reviews and there were others that had the same problem so I return it to amazon thank to amazon it was easy the return I gave 2 stars because the scooter looked nice I also bought the scooter E 300 and it was excellent looks even better and works great
1,Razor needs to Perfect Technology,"Razor really needs to perfect it's technology before putting something like this out on the market. I read the reviews and was a little gun-shy but my son really wanted one for Christmas so I caved. Plus the exclusive Amazon Blue is his favorite color which I thought would be an added surprise.After following the directions to the letter, the scooter worked perfectly for a day and a half. Then it was done. No amount of charging or troubleshooting would help.Money was refunded, however. Amazon refund system is wonderful.DO NOT BUY THIS SCOOTER TILL THEY FIX THEIR PROBLEMS!"
4,great gift,The box was setting on my front porch when I arrived home and my daughter could tell exactly what she was receiving for her birthday from the picture on the box.
1,I Convict this book to a slow death.,"I dont know why I picked this book up, after reading the back I think the premise of hot sweaty prisoners on work release, around a vunerable crippled former prosecuter held alot of promise. Who doesnt like reading about all that potentially pent up sexual energy being released? So I read it, and the writing was really slow and formulaic, and I kept reading it, waiting for it to kick into high gear, and it never did, sure Mr. ""wrongfully accused"" gets together with ""timid, gun shy prosecuter"" in the Haybarn, but it was ridiculously tame and embarassingly immature ""he looked between her thighs and smiled realizing she wasnt lying about being a real blonde"" Har Har Har. Blah, boring. The mystery that is supposed to be taking place throughout isnt even interesting enough to remember, the characters were so two dimensional, and I didnt even finish it because It was a waste of time."
2,Two boys' review: Poor design defeats Superman's greatest foe,"If you are thinking of buying or already have bought a Superman action figure for your child, look elsewhere for a villian action figure. We bought both the Superman and Lex Luthor action figures. Superman gets played with and Lex, well, he's at the bottom of the toy box.The green attachments are poorly designed. The costume is so bulky that if you attempt to move Lex, the Krypto Armor simply begins to fall off the action figure.Here's some good Superman action figures I recommend:1. SUPERMAN RETURNS Kryptonite SMASH SUPERMAN Figure2. Justice League Original Members Action Figure Collection with 7 FiguresCheck out my other Amazon reviews for toys, books and games for young boys!"
2,Resonably complete and well organized,"With 2,500 wines reviewed, you'd think that the whole spectrum of California vintages would be covered...however, I found many of my favorite wines missing. Overall, its a good solid reference and worth the price."
4,Oh yes,Hey look who's back from forgotteness it's q-bertIt got a new look and 3d effectized :o) but i still play it on my atari 2600. boy what a difference with the technology nowadaysgreat idea.GhostRider666 The spirit of vengeance
3,"Hmmm, this may take a while to get used to.","She cues, but not as much as she could. I see the actions in her body and recognize what she is doing, but I teach yoga so may have an advantage there. I am not sure this is for the newbie yogi. She definitely has a bohemian style which you might either love or hate. I'm open to it, but it may take a while to really love it."
3,Not for beginners!,"I have recently become interested in learning yoga to increase my core strength and flexibility. I purchased this dvd last week at a retail store. I have already given up on it after trying it once. I have not really practiced yoga before and this is clearly for those more advanced in yoga and flexibility. There is no way I can get my body in the positions that she does and she doesn't give enough time or instruction on how to do it. By the time I figured out what she was doing, she was on to the next move. I think that this dvd might be great for those that already have advanced yoga skills, but definitely not for the beginner or if you are not flexible. I will pick up a dvd that has better instruction for beginners and maybe come back to this down the line."
1,Disappointing --- Old Material Recycled!!!!,"Because I have previous DVD's created by this yoga instructor, this DVD is useless!!! Waste of my money. All it is is recycled clips from other DVD's. Why this is not stated on the preview through Amazon is a mystery to me. I guess its all about $$$$ and they got mine!!"
1,Misleading Photo/Description.,Misleading Photo/Description. Does not show abs and engagement of ab muscles as shown on package cover and on the ad. All good workout videos show the muscle being worked. This one does not.
3,I was a little disappointed,"I read a number of the good reviews of this album on amazon so I tried this album out. I was disappointed. It is solid rock, more specifically grunge, and don't get me wrong, that's great. I must have missed this band in the mid 90's. Soundgarden is one of my favorites of all time, and I still like some Nirvana, PJ, etc. but this is just a bit too plodding and dated. My first thought when hearing it for the first time was 'this sounds very Nirvana-ish and very grunge.' I read too many reviews lauding the musical genius of this band, as well as comparisons to Tool. I love Tool and APC but these guys are not in that category unfortunately. I am just writing this review to save someone of like tastes from buying this full album. I was hoping for something that would either really move me or kick me in the rear but none of these songs did. Solid album but not great."
5,The best album that was hardly ever heard.,"This is, in my opinion, the greatest album ever. Failure's sound is so cool...and yet hard to explain. Out of the three albums they have made Fantastic Planet is the best album of them. That is all I have to say...about that."
5,Macbook Pro Perfect!,"I love the look and feel of this item. It is VERY snug though so takes time to get laptop in and out. There is a nice flat that goes over the macbook pro and protects it from the zipper. A huge plus 'cus it's my brand new (very expensive) baby! This product on the Marware site is much more expensive and you have to pay taxes. On Amazon you get it cheaper, don't pay taxes, and if you have Amazon Prime it ships free! The little pocket in front is a little tight for my iPhone and the phone does not fit in there with a a rubber case on it. A plastic case would work because it can slide in easy and the picket stretches. This is a high quality product and is highly recommended."
4,Great case overall!,"I really like this case. The way it looks and how the bottom corners are reinforced. Cons- top corners are not reinforced, zipper will scratch up your laptop if you aren't careful"
2,"Wears out quickly, leaves residue","So while this does protect my laptop, it doesn't do it in style. I have to wipe off a black residue from the front facing corners every day, and the thread has begun to fray throughout. For something I bought just a year ago and use for only one thing, this points to cheap construction and poor design. Can't wait to get something better!PS - what is with that macromedia flash symbol, am I the only one who finds that strange?"
1,Terrible and Delusional,"This book is so destructive for anyone attempting recovery; please don't buy into their false testimonys to abstinence from drugs and alcohol. If it was so easy to stop on your own, then the millions of addicts would be successful upon their first attempts. Almost all full blown drug addicts attempt recovery once on their own and several times after that. This book goes against all research, statistics, and FACTS!! Bottom line, it's a waste of money!!!!"
4,"For smokers, too","This type of recovery from addictions is gaining recognition, even in courts of law where a person that overdrinks is normally required to go to AA. I'm a smoker and just substitute smoking in the place of the alcohol advice thru much of the book. I'm still learning to recognize my Addictive Voice, but feel that anyone serious enough to quit ANY addiction should read this book. I was amazed at the concepts and definitions that Dr. Trimpey explained as to what's a disease, addiction, habit! His concept is so simple, I don't know why it's not as well known as AA! I thought I would be in for a lot of psychological babble, but not so. Simply informative and easier than a New Year's resolution."
2,Rational Recovery,"I am a substance abuse counselor and wanted to read this as some of my clients had mentioned it previously. I found the techniques of simply saying that one is done using is a bit out there. Recovery is not an event, it is a process, otherwise people would not have relapse down the road."
1,Just Say No?,"I found this book after abusing alcohol for many years, I've been in and out of treatment centers with little success, after reading this book and following the well laid out plan, I stayed sober for 2 days, did it again and lasted 1 day, since then I have gone to AA and now have been sober for almost a year,it may work for some, but it didn't work for me, also if you want any follow up care or feedback from other, you need to go to the authors website, and pay $29.00 a month.looks to me like the author of this book is totally in it for the money."
1,Hooked on Earth Science by Kevin cocks,"this book is horrible, it is poorley done and has no solid info. i thought it would be better but i was wrong. please dont buythis book, its a waste of money"
4,Not Too Bad !,"This seems to be a decent selection, except for song #1 which I could really do without. Reason being that I wasn't too familiar with it @ all. Otherwise, not too bad...most of the other songs I remembered."
4,By far their best album,"If you dig hip-hop in it's truest form than you've got to get ""Monkey Business."" Any ill Harmonics fan will appreciate this record as well as those experiencing them for the first time."
5,Delicious grape flavour without the artificial colour,"I really love this soda. I think Diet Rite struck gold when they thought of the idea of simply not putting that fake purple food colour into the soda. Now I can enjoy a refreshing grape soda flavour without worrying about staining the furniture, floor, or my clothes."
4,Good potential but....,"Started off great, fantastic graphics and the ships were good fun to fly. The problem is that you never know where to go or what to do. You're supposed to go out in to the universe and find ""jobs"" to do but with no direction or idea as to how to go about doing it. I went from one planet to another, nothing happened but I enjoyed the view. Too bad the game cheat manual is out of print."
1,JUNK!,"ONLY REASON THIS PRODUCT GETS A STAR IS AMAZON WANTS SOME SORT OF RATING. DON'T BUY THIS JUNK! PITTED WITHIN MONTHS OF PURCHASE. HEARD NOTHING FROM PUTCO IN REGARDS TO RETURN AND REPLACEMENT OR REFUND. BUYER BEWARE, DON'T BUY THIS VERY CHEAP PLASTIC JUNK!"
2,Good Intention clouded by too many big words,"While the nature of this book is pretty plausible the way it is written is horrible. The whole idea of this philosophy is that we are a spark of the divine possessing all the qualities of the Creator. Through the power of absolute certinaty we can accomplish anything.The draw is that Mr. Holmes writes in an obscure way that doesn't make sense. He uses terms from our modern language and assigns new meanings to them, i.e. self-conscious suddnely means you're aware of yourself or something along those lines. Secondly the author's style of writing uses many big words to define something as if making it sound like a science text book. The intention was good but the way he tries to convey his message is surrounded by too much funfare and fireworks that are frankly, unnecessary.And besides that point this book is a little too fluffy bunny and not realistic enough for me. Try any of the writings by the Kabbalah Centre."
1,Not the right edition,"I ordered both the book and the kindle version. I am reviewing the kindle version. The kindle edition is terrible, and I do not recommend purchasing it. I could not use it for my reading group because it did not include so many sections. I then had to order the hard copy."
3,Incomplete,If like me you have read the original publication then you would no that this particular offering is not complete is lacking much material and does not give a full understanding of the author's intent. On the other hand if you have never read the original then you will still like this presentation.
2,Audio Version Review so disapointed!!!,"This audio verison is read so fast that I have to turn my iPod to slow and even then I can't stand to listen to this recording of a fabulous book full of life changing information. It is read monotone, which I can handle. What I can't handle is the speed in which the text is read. There is no stopping for commas, periods etc. There doesn't even seem to be stopping to breathe!I'm writing this because I do read the reviews and would have thought twice and prehaps not purchased this had I known how fast it was read."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am new to the Church of Religious Science and just starting taking the Foundation(SOM) class. When you do a search in amazon for ""The Science of Mind"" by Ernest Holmes this is the first book that comes up and on the description is does not CLEARLY state it is not the real book, I had no clue how many pages there were in the book etc. Bascially this is the cliff note version of the real book. And no, the real book is not an antique and I found it in paperback at a local book store. I waited 10 days for the wrong book to come and did not realize what I had ordered, so I had to scramble to get the correct book. I have written a complaint to Amazon and to the seller of the used book I bought and I expect a full refund. I feel it should clearly state it is not the real book.I am enjoying the REAL book!!!! And I am enjoying the SOM class!"
1,Kindle Version isn't readable,"The formatting of the Kindle version makes this book almost impossible to read. Some sentences make no sense at all. If you want to read it on your Kindle, I'd suggest downloading one of the free PDF versions that are available online and convert that for reading on your Kindle (you can find out how to do that on your Kindle page)."
3,for dancer types,This would be a good workout if I could remember the steps. He he. You learn real choreography and it isn't exactly easy. You have to put alot of effort into learning the steps and then it would be a good workout.Not for someone looking for an aerobics type workout.
1,Fame? Ha!,"The Fame dance workout was never delivered. After 2 weeks I inquired--Amazon refunded my money and the store couldn't understand why it was never delivered. I am disappointed it wasn't delivered, but appreciate prompt refund."
4,The duke does slapstick!,This is far from a great film but it has enough good parts to make it worth watching. Lee Marvin is way over the top and John Wayne is too old for the romantic parts of the movie but you can get past it. I was a little sad to see him spank another woman in a movie like he did in McLintock but this was the good old boys club doing these films so they are far from politically correct. The rest of the cast is solid and the locations are beautiful. The young actress that plays the pre teen daughter is way to old and looks it but she is cute and carries it off.
4,Wayne & Ford,A favorite movie of mine. Wayne in a more light hearted mood - with Lee Marvin - MUCH more light hearted then when they co-starred in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. Nice light touch by Ford. A lot of fun.
5,Don't Take This Too Serious,"John Wayne does a great job at Playing John Wayne! This movie is not a serious work -- but rather it is a great excuse for the Duke and his posse to kick it in Hawaii.Navy buds, pretty girls, beautiful tropical scenery and a big bowl of popcorn makes for a great family night at home. It took me a long to find this movie, but fortunately I finally did.I can't even begin to count how many times my family and I have seen this great Wayne yarn."
3,"its no quiet man, but its still fun","a year after his last true masterpiece (""the man who shot liberty valance"") director john ford reunited with two of his stars, john wayne and lee marvin, for the final comedy of his career. while wayne is terrific as the brawling owner of a south pacific bar, and marvin has fun in the role victor mclaglen would have essayed at an earlier time, the movie is hurt irreparably by the stilted acting of elizabeth allen, in the role that would once have been played (and splendidly) by maureen o'hara. too many cliches of hula girls and the like, but then again there is also the wonderfully touching christmas pageant sequence, set in the perpetually leaky-roofed church. is this great john ford? not by any means. but it IS john ford, and thus deserves to be seen."
5,Under appreciated John Wayne,"The most fun movie John Wayne ever made. Amazing landscape shots of Hawaiian islands. This movie technically qualifies as a Christmas movie. Story line begins on the 7th of December and ends at Christmas. Part romantic comedy this family fun film can be appreciated by all ages. Play drinking game using character names and action shots (fights, breaking bottles, etc.)."
5,Not a Western,"This is one John Wayne that can be enjoyed over and over. Hey, it is not a western but it certainly is one of his best movies ever made."
5,Risky undertakings,"A fast paced, rousing read to satisfy the thirst for adventure and curiosity.Two young men, one looking for bold undertakings the other for orchids, attempt traveling through the improbable and perilous Darien Gap between Panama and Columbia.This is a story of being kidnapped and held for ransom by a revolutionary Columbian guerrilla group for nine months in a most inhospitable environment. Their day to day existence in this bug-ridden, disease-infested jungle amid these radical insurgents is a page turner.Conveyed with wit, sensitivity and anxiety, Dyke and Winder's escapades make for a riveting read."
5,Holding leaders responsible for their behavior.,"Dr. Conley's story is achingly familiar to those of us who are still pioneering and persevering in male dominated hierarchies. Her experience is not limited to medicine. It mirrors my experience in corporate America. There are no easy solutions and she is to be commended for not offering platitudes or inventing a happy ending when there is none in sight. It offers a blueprint for what to expect in dealing with descrimination which is very helpful. The only recourse we seem to have at this point is to continue to break the silence, one voice at a time, and her's is eloquent. She held management's feet to the fire. Maybe if enough of them get scorched, they'll learn to take responsibility for their behavior. Meantime, we will continue to look them squarely in the eyes and persist, 'what are you going to do about this?'"
4,Yes and no,"Ernest May makes the case that the French army was not worse than the German army; its generals were just incompetent. This is an interesting (and probably accurate) distinction to make, but the difference between being a badly led army and a bad army is not an obvious one. No modern historian claims that the French had poor equipment or insufficient numbers, but only that French organization and doctrine were ineffective against the Germans.Is this all that different from what May is saying? Not really. Where May becomes most interesting is in his analysis of the course of events in May 1940, where he makes a persuasive case that the French generals were both unlucky and foolish. Whether he has attacked the conventional wisdom is unclear, but the book is a lucid exposition of the conflict."
4,Wonderful Essays.....,"If you're a Francophile as I am, or even if you're not, I think you'll enjoy these wonderfully written essays by women about France.Some of the stories were humorous, some poignant, but all of them are very entertaining."
3,Not their best..,"Not their best performance by far, but an must for fans of Lukather/Carlton. The Cd of this material is in quality of sound and performance in another league."
4,exceptional intro to an obscure culture,"(Well, the culture is obscure to me, anyway.)This was, all told, an excellent work. A strong selection of stories, brimming with that authentic, folksy feel--and, indeed, collected, for the most part, more than eighty years ago--one cannot but glean a strong feeling for how the Armenians live, love, and think. The latter part of the book, dealing with fables--many of which, as the editors admit, likely derive from ancient Greek traditions--show well how familiar concepts and lessons are likely to recur the world over with only marginal changes to characters, circumstances, or subplots."
5,Dancing With Life And Death,"I found Barefoot's book to be a powerful read; truly well researched and strong in delivery of death messages that run the gamut from almost humorous to heart-wrenching. The meticulous research does not encumber the reader and the stories flow easily one to another. The overall end result of the Confederate cause is apparent throughout the book, though the moments of elation, often just before the death of the named participants in this book, create a happy/sad reading experience that cannot leave your soul untouched."
2,There are better options out there...,"I received this as a gift, and it seemed alright at first, but after trying it out I have hardly used the system at all. My iPod (2nd gen touch) doesn't charge while plugged in, which I can deal with. But my biggest issue is that no matter how hard I try I cannot adjust the audio to how I would like it to sound. I've played with the bass and sub as well as the equalizers on my iPod and I still do not get any results that I would deem satisfactory. Honestly I get better sound from a cheap portable dock. So on my shelf it sits collecting dust, as I save up for something a bit better. If sound quality is important for you, I highly recommend giving this system a try before you purchase."
2,Poor radio reception,"The unit worked just fine, packaging was great, when we packed it up to take it back the inside lid had where all the parts went. The radio has very poor reception. The wire antennae that came with it was useless, tried to buy an aftermarket antennae and all those have coaxial ends, so had to look for an ""F"" adapter from the radio to thecoaxial, finally found one at Frys; but still could not get good reception. So willbe returning it. The IPOD dock worked great and the CD player worked great and the whole unit was nice and small and it had a nice sound,"
2,More issues than its worth,I was given this stereo as a Christmas present. My cousin was given the same one. it worked great for the first couple of months. However my cousin said that hers stopped playing her cd's and then the sound started getting screwed up. about six months later my stereo would not play the music on my ipod even though i hadnt changed anything in the stereo or the ipod. Furthermore the radio reception sucks. If i were you look harder and find some thing better.
4,Very nice item,Item is as advertized. It comes with wall mounting brackets which can be used to mount the speakers and main unit to the wall. It works well and sounds pretty good for a small stereo. I have a Sirius receiver connected through the aux jack and it works and sounds good.
4,Open with Caution,"Received this stereo for Christmas and just set it up yesterday. So far I'm quite pleased with the system. One important note though should you buy this unit. The packaging sucks. BE VERY CAUTIOUS WHEN OPENING THE BOX. If you cut through the tape on the top flaps, as 90% of folks would, you could quite likely slash a gash right down the center of the remote. If TEAC had used an additional thin piece of cardboard on the top of the styrofoam or just placed the remote to one side of the center of the box it wouldn't have been a problem, but they didn't.One other small thing, with such thin speakers that are easily mounted to a wall they should have designed them with the lower foot area being removable. The speakers are only about an inch thick but they are nearly three inches off the wall when mounted to account of the stand portion beneath the actual speaker."
2,Horrid Smell!,"I bought this soap in an attempt to help the eczema that had developed on my fingertips. In the first use it dried my hands out, and made the eczema worse, or at least more noticeable. I couldn't get past the horrible smell to continue using this soap! I still have the soap in case my eczema returns & I have no other option, but I've had to seal it within a Ziploc bag in order for it to not stink up my bathroom cabinet. Maybe after a few uses the scent won't be so bad, but I've had for several months & it's still very strong."
3,3 stars when compared to his other work only,"I don't know how others feel, but I do not care for an artist redoing old songs and passing them off as new. Many of the songs on this CD are different renditions of songs on earlier CDs, and they aren't as good...the version of ""Wrong To Love You"" on this is so limpid as to be sleep-inducing when compared to the strength of the original.Frankly, it is still a good CD, but NOT when compared to the originality of earlier work. Buy it to complete your collection, and for the few new Chris Isaak songs on it, but don't expect greatness."
4,"2nd-best book for Step III (probably Step II, too)","I'm not in Family Practice, so I can't comment on its usefulness for those Boards (I HOPE it's not enough! - smile!) And it is, in truth, a wee outdated. But neither of those ever were it's strength. What IS, is the format. These qestions are in the same format as most of what you'll see on Step III: long stories (that will really intimidate slow readers) with both useful and distracting information, followed by several questions designed to test your ability to look at the same patient from many different angles. I have not seen any other book that recreates this so authentically. The second strength is its emphasis on preventive medicine, a topic heavily tested on the Boards but one I, at least, had inadequate preparation in. And third, there are LOTS of questions with VERY detailed answers and explanations. (By the way, the FIRST-best book for Step III is ""Ace the Boards"")"
2,Performance lacking,"Thinking this was Kohler, I would have expected more in its overall performance.The Idea of Multifunction was great to shift to rain, massage and stream.The problem is with the rain. Because of the design of the head, the rain only comes out from the edges of the whole head, and the water spray is angled out.My shower enclosure is 4.5"" x 4.5"", so when the showerhead is on the rain function, the shower walls and the shower curtain gets most of the water. You should be standing about three inches to make the most of the water.The practical use of the shower is just to keep it in stream or massage mode.I have purchased the regular Fairfax showerhead instead and shelved this product.Finish is perfect though... isn't as high maintenance as the polished ones. Water marks come right off with a microfiber cloth.I have bought all fixtures int his finish. If you don't like to mix and match finishes, other Brushed/Matte Stainless Steel finishes come very close."
1,"Poinless, useless garbage - Very sad publishing.","This is the most useless waste of tree life ever. I really dont see the point in this specific subject matter, NOR do I see the point of the authur taking the time to write a ""series"" of such nonsense. He obviously spent his entire life compiling this material from nightmares and daydreams based on his absolute paranoia and delusionary personal experiences. If there is room in the publishing world for this piece of work, then why not just publish jibberish in pig latin? Because that is basically what this amounts to. I only hope the author has written something else - if only to further prove his oblique stupidiy. Thank you."
4,surprisingly decent,"I guess this CD was supposed to be some blow off CD but the CD is actually pretty good compared to some of the other material he has put out that he cared more about. I wish Prince would just stick to making good rock and dance songs instead of trying to appeal to the R&B crowd. In this CD, you can find some of the things that truly make him good like his capability of writing good rock songs and even rap style songs like ""Dig You Better Dead"" are catchy. Although the name is corny, ""I Rock""... is catchy as well."
2,So Sad,"Just another bunch of forgettable throwaways. I don't even remember any of the songs on this CD and this is coming from someone who can remember every note, drum loop, guitar riff from his previous material. It proved that the good times had passed and are to never return."
3,Paige's book review,"""Pleasing the Ghost"" is a funny story but I don't like it.I think the words and repitition of ""pleases"" that are pointless.I like Bo [the dog]though. The way he jumped up and barked when ghosts came through the window. It's cute! My least favorite charactor was Colin because he thinks he is so cool.He is the most conceited charactor in the whole book.I liked the part when Uncle Arvie asked for the 1st. ""please"" it was very exciting because you have not read the book and don't know what will happen next. The 2nd. and 3rd. ""pleases"" start to get boring.I think it is most similar to ""The Sixth Sense""because both kids see ghosts.Sharon Creech has an unique style of writing but it is not my favorite.It is so short and she crams it then stops short like:""I wonder why aunt Julia has that huge box..."" It's so annoying!I would recommend it to gr.3 up.On a scale of 1 - 10 I give it a 3!"
5,Recomended Read,"THIS BOOK WAS EXTREMELY HOT AND SEXY, I have read Shelley Bradley as her pen name Shayla Black and I worried that I would'nt care for the books she writes under her own name...No dissapointments here!"
2,PLEASE DON'T BE FOOLED BY THESE OTHER REVIEWS!!!!!!!,"this is NOT,i repeat NOT five stars!in all honesty it's more like 1.5 or 2 stars and i'm a big fan of slug & atmosphere.albums like overcast,godlovesugly,the felt project,and the dynospectrum album is much better than this.though the lyrics are thought provoking,but slug has been better,the production doesn't hold up.it's some of the weakest i've heard from rhymesayers.there's only a couple tracks that stand out,but i'd have to say ""don't ever f**king question that"" is the best.if you wanna hear slug at his best check out the dynospectrum album.slug spits classic verse after classic verse."
3,Practical Tips/Common Sense,"I was eager to use this item and hopeful that the author could provide information leading to ways of generating additional income as a Notary Public. While it did point out a couple of ways to capitalize and expand notarial services, for the most part I found the information on the order of common sense. Clearly, as a Notary Public one must advertise, network, and do what needs to be done in this technological age. As Notary Publics We must utilize all avenues of media so that we are continually expanding our market. I honestly don't think I needed this item to recognize what I needed to do. Having said that, it is well organized and will be useful to those who need direction and are new to the notary services field."
3,A bit too tight,"I bought these boots to replace my day to day brown boots. I had read on an online review here that unlike normal Charles David shoes, they did fit you if you ordered them in your normal size (my case, 7.5). WRONG!! I should have gotten them in an 8, the 7.5 barely fit me, they're a bit tight. I've been breaking them in, so that the leather will stretch a little, and I believe that in a month or so, I will be able to use them a whole day, however, right now, they cut my circulation, which is not cool. Aside from that, everything is great. They smell amazing (all leather), they're comfortable (except for the tightness) which is a lot to say, if you take into consideration that they are pretty high.Recommendation, buy them half a size LARGER than your normal shoe size. If you do that, you'll be in the clear."
3,So disappointed,"I was so disappointed. The quality of these boots is exceptional but the style was very strange. The toe is way too rounded and makes these gorgeous leather boots look like ""wellington rain boots"". they look great from the side angle but very weird from the front. Sorry going back."
4,Cliff Richard Does It Again !,"Wanted is a good CD ! Particular favorites are Let Me Be The One,Somewhere Over The Rainbow/What A Wonderful World,and When You Walk In The Room. Alan tarney gives Cliff lots of support on this. Fans will love it."
4,8th-first year of college,"this bag lasted me a while. i ran through a lot of no-name bags in middle school and finally decided to spend a bit more on something more substantial. the only reason i'm not using it now is because inside the bag, pieces were coming off the fabric which i assume to be the waterproofing stuff. (if this is wrong, please let me know what it is.) and my lanyard got stuck in the front zipper and i dont want to destroy neither the bag nor the lanyard. this bag has made a faithful Jansport customer."
2,Great for a temporary situation,"The finish is just as described, fairly simple but time consuming to put together and perfect for a small amount of clothes. This is not a long term dresser by any means, Two knobs refuse to tighten and the drawers don't line up quite right. It's being used as a dresser in a nursery. Eventually, my two children will share and room and I'll be getting a matching suite of furniture but in the mean time this does do the job."
3,Looks Nice But Not Functional,"This piece of furniture looks nice as I had expected, but the drawers are not able to hold much. This is because the face of the drawers are about 7"" high, but on the inside, the 2 sides and back are only about 5"" high. So you can't fill them to the top. You don't realize this until everything is unpacked and you've all ready started to put it together. Then it would be a pain to try to repack it to return it. Also, it is about 70 lbs. so it would be difficult to get it to a shipping place."
3,Good for price,"besides the fact that this jacket is very staticky, it's a very warm fleece jacket.can't beat for the price"
4,Fine Elixir,"Many reviews start with ""Don't start here"". In the case of Robyn Hitchcock, that advice is probably too linear. So sure, start here - but with ""Beautiful Queen"" - my reason for getting the disc. An acquaintance once asked about a Hitchcock song, ""What's it about?"" But the answer's not the point - the songs are. It's a feeling. Four stars because it's an uneven effort. But all the same, once you enter the sound you'll know what I mean. Hear also, ""The Speed of Things"". It's life in 4 minutes."
1,Don't do it,"Like Grandmasterflash says...""Don't do it"". What a piece of garbage. The so called switch is so poorly machined it may not screw into your light. But it's really just another piece so that it appears you are getting a lot for your money. I didn't bother to use this. The 3 LED lights did work...for a while and then a circuit or something blew, and it no longer works. Output was decent. But if you are desperate for a good LED light, spend the extra and buy the real 3W Maglite. I bought a 3AA LED for my wife's car. I was impressed by the amount of light this thing puts out and the adjustability of it. Put your $10 into the real deal."
1,Just a Few Suggestions for the Author,"1. Buy a copy of Conway's All the Worlds Fighting Ships 1860-1905.2. Actually read a history of the subject written by a credible historian. I suggest Corbett.3. Review or I should say have somebody who knows what they are looking at review the photos that are included in your book.4. Try a different genre, such as romance novels."
3,The Imperial Russian Argonauts against the Japanese.,"Unlike what some of the previous reviewers have said, this book is not a complete disaster and it is certainly better that watching paint dry. Dr. Pleshakov could have given us a better balanced view of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 by viewing the Japanese side. Also more material thrown in about the siege of Port Arthur as good background before the Second Pacific Squadron put to sea. The reasons for the war were rather simplistic, so this could have been improved. I think the editing was horrible, especially when referring to the Russian and English (Bear and Lion, not Bear and Whale)conflict. This could have been a much better read, but the author focused on the Squardron's stay in Madagascar and Indochina, rather than the reasons for the war, the siege of Port Arthur, and the battle itself."
2,they said it was paperback and i got a hardcopy,"i was looking for a paperback copy , and it said it was a paperback copy ,and the y sent me a hardback copy ...not much else i would like to report"
5,Just when I think this author can't get any better ...,"... she does! I am loving the Wingman Warrior Series - heading towards the last couple of books now and I don't want it to end but, as they say, all good things must come to an end. Great story about Nikki and Carson. Loved getting an update about TAG and family. Highly recommend this book - and all the books by this author - haven't read a bad one yet!"
4,"Beautiful, but a little disappointing","I ordered the stationary refill because I adore Bantock's art and have enjoyed using the note cards based on ""The Venetian's Wife"". Though the stationary in the set is beautiful, I was disappointed that the set only included postcards attributed to Sabine. I wanted to see some of Griffin's work, but save a few of the envelopes, nothing attributed to Griffin was included."
4,A pretty cool collection of hot recipes....,"Like quite a few of Pat Chapmans other books, this one concentrates mostly on recipes, with a fairly sparse section on ingredients and methods. However, this is A Good Thing, if you already own one of the definative works such as the authors The Curry Bible. The work, therefore, stands on the strength of it's recipes. And it stands pretty tall on those. From the standards ( Chicken Madras ) to the downright yucky ( lambs brain curry ), the recipes are easy to follow, and as expected from this source, extremely tasty. Each recipe comes from a well-known curry house, mostly in the UK, but a few from the sub-continent, and the USA. Each is also accompanied with Pats' anecdote about the restaurant, which are frankly pretty tedious. Overall, an excellent, and pretty inexpensive collection of damn good recipes!"
1,Worst Ever,"As a college Chemistry Prof. for over 25 years , who has reviewed on line tutorials..this is the WORST EVER !The guy speaks SO FAST...and moves from Button to Button and Menu to Menu SO F A S T.... it is absolutely impossible to follow or learn anything.Someone in this company should hire someone who actually knows how to teach.."
5,Gotta Love Joni!,"Good CD with some of her best hits! Love to listen in the car, or when having a quiet night in."
5,Missing single on the Mitchell 'Hits',"the best thing about this release is that it contains 'The Urge for Going'--I had hunted for nineteen years for a copy of this song, which was only released as a single. The only copy I had before this CD was by Tom Rush---good, but it wasn't Joni."
3,Buy the albums themselves,"I'm a huge Joni fan, and for me, one of the most beautiful things about listening to Joni Mitchell's music is listening to a whole album from start to finish....getting that range of emotions. moving along with the flow and plan of the album. Buy Blue or Court and Spark and let the whole album do the talking."
5,Helpful,"Scriptures from various translations of the Bible are taken and applied to specific prayer situations. She does a little bit of teaching in the introduction to the various sections, but not much. The Scriptures provide the guidance in how to pray in faith and expect God to answer, based on what He said in His Word.In a few instances she's taken prayers from other Christian organizations and adapted them. The book begins with individual prayers and moves from there to cover group prayer. The weakest part of the book for me was her introduction on the singles section. Overall this is an uplifting, instructive book on prayer."
3,It is what it is,"Please to be noting: ""The 20th Century Masters"" series as a whole is only for casual fans of an artist. If you just want someone's biggest hits, you're advised to look elsewhere. Besides, PE is an album group anyway, so a greatest hits is antithetical to who they are. What do you expect for under $10??"
1,Don't buy,"This product should be titled ""Waste of 40 dollars"". I have wasted 3 hours of my life that I will never get back. If you want your money's worth- this is not the product for you. If you want meaningless garbage on cd - contact me and I will custom make one for you - much cheaper."
2,Why did I waste my money?,"This software su**s. The first things I want to learn in a new language are NOT how to get medicine for diarreah and headache. THis is what you can learn, it some detail. You can also learn how to order about 5 Persian dishes at a restaurant. What you CANNOT learn from this software is how to say anything you might actually need were you to go to Iran or want to have a conversation with someone in Farsi."
5,just what i was looking for!,"id had the older vhs 2 tape set a while back, and when i decided again to play clawhammer banjo dan levenson was my first choice. im happy this set is in dvd format, as it will be even easier to access the individual teaching portion...and lord knows an old-timer like me can use all the help he can get. thanks."
2,"maybe 1 DVD worth of material, bad value","SInce this set of DVD's has the same title as the book, I kind of expected it to cover the same material. Not even close. He spends 2 DVD's teaching one song. Kind of a rip-off considering the book which costs half as much teaches 12 songs and comes with 2 cd's. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 was seeing someone play is valuable. The DVDs do a good job of showing left and right hand positioning. The reason I bought a DVD instead of a book was I wanted to see the right hand position while playing. Is it worth the money? In my opinion.... No."
4,Good Case,"It's a good, solid case. It does it's job well, I dropped my iPod for the first time the other day and there was no damage. I was confused when i purchased it though, I though it meant a hard plastic screen protector but it comes with those soft plastic screen protectors you have to smooth on just right to keep from having air bubbles on your screen. The only other gripe I have with it is it pops open a little too easily in my opinion but a pair of tiny pieces of duct tape fixed that."
4,Good service & product,"Product was delivered very promptly and is as advertised. If you need a very strong case because you're prone to dropping the unit on hard surfaces I don't think this will quite do it, but for protection during normal use it works very well."
4,good insights,"The Adoption Eclipse tells a story of the ups and downs of the adoption process. It gives a glimpse into the emotional and technical factors that go into successfully starting a family in this way. The characters and situations are believable, and the message is positive but realistic.A very readable book that also contains good references for those who want to start their own adoption process. I read it the first time in under an hour.For an effective insight into how adoption affects your life, read this book."
4,Arrow Through You,"After recording an album with Crazy Horse devotees, Pearl Jam, Neil Young brings back the real deal on Broken Arrow. The album isn't made up so much of songs as loose jams. This isn't a bad thing as that's what Crazy Horse does best, jam. There are a couple of instrumentals, notably ""Loose Change"", that show off the brilliant musicianship of the group. Amid all the guitars, is one of Mr. Young's best acoustic numbers of the 90's, ""Music Arcade"". One complaint of Broken Arrow is that the vocals are low down in the mix and makes for a difficult listen in spots."
4,All the lowdown on Bill,"Fascinating book, though I felt just a bit naughty reading all the ""hot gossip"" that Hartigan dispenses. He obviously knows all the insiders, though, and I suppose it's important to have all this stuff written down while the old-timers are still around who remembers AA's earliest days.There are some peculiar errors: on p 61, Hartigan describes Bill's entering Towns Hospital on his sobriety date, Nov. 11, 1934. But on p. 55, he describes the ill-fated golf trip to Staten Island (which happened several weeks or months before Bill got sober) as also taking place on Nov. 11, 1934: clearly not just a typo, since the point of this story is that it took place on Armistice Day. Something is wrong here, and I'm still trying to figure it out!It's unfortunate that this book has the same title as Robert Thomsen's much more comprehensive (and better, in my view) bio of Bill W., and might be confused with it."
3,"Beautiful book, yes. That's true..","It is a beautifully illustrated book. I have little against the book per se. And yet, there are other books out there that have more depth which deserve more stars than this particular book. ""The Boy Who Wouldn't Go To Bed"" is another beautifully illustrated bedtime book that features a train. Books by Ruth Krauss/Maurice Sendak, Charlotte Zolotow (""Where the Wind Blows"" and ""The Sleepy Book"" are really wonderful night time books), John Burningham (like ""Hey! Get Off Our Train"" features a train) and a number of other authors and illustrators have written time-tested books that are worthy of the most number of stars available."
3,A Strange Ambition,"I'm kind of in mourning for Stoppard. He's still far and away the best, most natural writer of dialogue in the English language, and he still clearly possesses a very sharp-witted and perceptive understanding of human nature, and an ability to depict characters in such a way that you can see how even some fairly sophisticated and difficult ideas might have arisen from the distinctive quirks of their individual personalities, and vice versa.But somewhere between _Indian Ink_ and _The Invention of Love_ he for some unfathomable reason decided that he was going to stop writing plays and start writing three-dimensional, illustrated history textbooks. Why?? It seems like such a misdirection of his abilities. I'm glad that as he ages gracefully, he's able to happily sail off to Byzantium, but I never asked to be taken onto the boat."
4,Just as good as the show!,"I first found out about this because I watch Spyder Games. The best songs on this CD are Poe's 'Hey Pretty', Bif Naked's 'October Song', and Willa Ford's 'Tender', which is the reason that I bought the soundtrack in the first place. The rest of the songs aren't too bad, but I usually just listen to the ones that I listed above.You won't be unhappy with this though!I recommend it!"
4,Magic Mushroom Band - 'RU Spaced Out 2' (Voiceprint),"The Magic Mushroom Band's follow-up to 'Re-Hash' {see my review} and a bit better - at least I thought so. 'RU Spaced Out 2' more than proves this UK ensemble to be in a more of a trance / ambient direction. Tunes here that's sure to lure you in are ""Remember Our Future"", their tasteful cover of Hawkwind's ""Hurry on Sundown"", the power pop number ""Herbs And Spice"" and ""Thought Train"". Also, the synth-strong ballad ""Life Is So Strange"" is a nice addition to this compilation."
5,wow,"This is such a different, unique sound! I love how they mixed funk and rock together. Each song has its own flavor so they aren't one of the bands in which every song sounds the same. Guitarist's David Ryan-Harris' voice is smooth and nice to listen to, while Johnny Colt and Kenny Cresswell provide the bass and drums. I'm just blown away. I heard ""Reasons Why"" and thought they were pretty good, but I never knew BNI's CD would be THIS good. You have to get this!"
3,"Not Bad, But Could Be Better","If it weren't for the fact that I already speak fluent Russian, this book would not have been very helpful to me. If you're learning Ukrainian from scratch, this book can give you the basics, but it might also confuse you. The grammar was not explained as clearly as it could have been, and I think I understood it only because of my Russian. I also can't believe that there are no accent marks for the Ukrainian words. That has been my biggest frustration, because when I try out my Ukrainian on some Ukrainian friends, I have no clue if I'm pronouncing the words correctly, and sometimes the way I say things sounds funny to them. However, this book can give you a good start if you already have experience with a slavic language. Just make sure you get a dictionary so that you'll know where the accent marks are. But if you're a beginner, you might want to look for a better book."
4,Thank God 'I Love The Nightlife' isn't on here!,"It seems like all of today's disco compilations have to include ""I Love The Nightlife,"" not so with this compilation. For the last year and a half I've been looking for something like this for my Y2K party and finally I found something that we can dance to. There's only one reason why I didn't give it a 5 star rating-on a lot of the tracks the original artists aren't singing their songs, so be forewarned. If you remember those fabulous nights at your local disco, you'll immediately return to those long ago, but not forgotten days of yore."
1,"Dear Clint Willis,",If you and your party can channel all that hate against the real enemies of this country we would be at a much farther step with the war on terror. But you are so blinded by hate for your fellow Americans that you undermine every step of the way and put our troops in danger who are in the frontlines in harms way. Don't think that the enemy is not paying attention to what libs' have to say. Why do you think they sound like liberals on every video and audio tapes? They're quoting libs'... they're listening... I've read your books... didn't buy one of 'em... but I've read 'em... I refuse to give money to a party that's against everything I believe... HATE is just one of them...
1,Title says it all,"Whenever Clint Willis finally gets around to compiling a book about hating Saddam Hussein and Osama bin-Laden, then Clint and his cronies might have some credibility. As it is, their blind hatred and knee-jerk reactionary attitudes against Conservatives have produced reams of commentary...loopy, mean-spirited, small-minded ideas that are fundamentally wrong about nearly everything in the world. These pundits' loathing of Conservatism has blinded them against the real enemies of America and freedom. Ironically, it's the Conservatives who provide the strength, vision, and courage to defend the rights of Liberals to spew their opinions. Hatred...that's what this book is. At least truth in advertising is in effect here."
5,HARD TO FIND,Been looking for this book for years ... NOW I OWN IT ... the photography is so colorful and interesting ... If your lucky to find this buy it ..
1,Demo unit,"The unit I received when I placed my order was marked ""not for resale"", and the batteries in it were dead. If I had it to do over again I would have purchased it from another source."
4,"Fits Standard Cradle Mattress, Soft, but a Little Flimsy","Pros:-Very soft and well cushioned without being ""puffy"" (so the SIDS risk is kept low)-doesn't make a crinkly sound, despite having waterproof vinyl on the bottom-waterproof!-fits standard cradle mattress and is reasonably pricedCons:-despite what the washing instructions say, DO NOT PUT THIS IN THE DRYER (or do so at your own risk); you should let it air dry (buy two so that you don't need the one being washed back on the cradle right away). The first time I put this in the dryer (and temperature setting was not hot), it came out with 3-4 small tears in the waterproof vinyl. I taped them closed so that the mattress pad remains waterproof."
4,Nice quilted protector,"This was a smart buy for our cradle mattress. The mattress is filled with duck down and we didn't want it to get wet, and this product protects it with no problem."
1,did not fit,This was 3/4 too small for standard crib mattress I think it was made for a bassinet as opposed to a crib it was way too small
4,"""Are you gonna call me like you said you would?""","Switch was a very talented group of musicians, and they are apparently fondly remembered by a small (but perceptive) number of Old School R&B fans like me. There are a lot of good songs on here--""There'll Never Be"", ""Friend in the Sky"", ""Call on Me"", etc. but none comes close to ""I Call Your Name"", one of the all-time great slow jams, presented here in all its 7 minutes-plus glory. The opening rap is sweet, funny and completely endearing, and Bobby DeBarge proceeds to sing like an exalted angel throughout the rest of the song. Everyone I've played this for has fallen in love with it: ""I'm a man now, baby, a grown man!"" It should have been a monster hit.....just typing about it now makes me wanna slip it back on the cd player."
5,Good buy...better product,"This is far better than the one we had purchased at Bass Pro Shop for more money. The other one we threw away. This one is hanging on the wall. Looks nice also. The only drawback that I saw was the little engravable plate is already fastened to the wood and you would have to take the whole board to get the plate engraved. My choice would have been to be able to get the engraving done, then possibly peel a backing off and put the plate onto the wood myself...however..I can see inherent problems with keeping it really straight for some people. Overall a great buy.Allen Company Skull Cover Antler Mounting Kit"
5,Awesome Bible study!,You'll love it! Buy it! I'm really enjoying it and look forward to growing closer to God because of this book and the insights in it.Love it so far!
3,Sooner or later by Elizabeth Ad,I enjoyed the story but was disgusted with all the typos. Several sometimes to every page. This is definitely not good enough. Totally spoils the enjoyment. Why does this occur in Skype books. Not the first time this has happened.
4,We mast unit our forces!,"It's cool to play for dark paladin. It's amasing adventure in Dragonlance.Its WAR, but not usual war of Good and Evil, no here paladin will save lawful evil lich. It classical war of Chaos and Law. If you ever test it you'll never forget it."
2,needs to be updated by atleast 40 years.,"This tape dwells too tooo too much in the 19th century. The clips of modern gurkha family life and rituals are frustratingly poor in viusal quality and short. Still, it's quite informative as a source of history. I wish there were more and better footages of gurkha family camps, festivals and villages. My father was in the British Army for 33 yrs and I grew up in Hongkong where about 6000 gurkha soldiers and their families were stationed before the Chinese takeover of the then colony. Well, I have seen better.Zico Rai, USA."
3,A wonderful account of a subject little has been written on.,"Hildegard writes from the perspective of a young child brought up in war torn Denmark. The pain, the hunger, the cold, related in a way that only one who has experienced can tell. This is a commendable work for a first time writer with a story that was crying to be told and which the reader needs to be aware of. I would like to see more works by Hildegard. I would like to read her accounts of life in the United States after the war."
2,Poor pre-buy information,"Have not tried the tape yet, but was really surprised when I thought I was purchasing 2 new video tapes. When they arrived both were obviously not new boxes, and one even had a work out sheet of the previous owner in it.Worse yet, I paid $3.62 cents for each and there was a sticker that looked like it was from a garage sale with $1.00 on it. This was sold by bearbooks...so beware."
3,Interesting not inspiring,"ACSS continued their unfortunate decline down a more accessible (ie: bigger-selling) world-dance beat at the expense of compositional integrity. Even other approaches like the guest vocals feel like contrived pop-exotica, doing little to compliment the band's unique instrumental interplay, lacking sorely here, for what still should be a fun, somewhat authentic experience."
4,The Viz translation sucks.,"The original version from Shueisha was a lot better. The translation doesn't bring out what it meant. Besides, people who read this manga are probably 90% all people who saw it from Cartoon Network. They do not know the real version of Rurouni Kenshin- Meiji Kenkaku Romantan. In other words, wanna-bes who think they know everything when the anime they love is really something else."
1,not very happy customer,"ok.daybed arrived kind of scratched...oh well.the worth thing is that you have to buy link springs ,because nowhere to put matress on after this bed assemlied.link spring cost from $60 to $100.instructions hardly readable,made with some technical errors.seller didnt respond on the both messages i sent via e-mail....my advise -go to local retailers and i garantee you will find daybed already with link springs for $120-170."
3,Gator Hooded Sweatshirt,Product was as expected; a little disappointed that the lettering and logo were not sewn on the sweatshirt.
3,new english-russian medical dictionary,"DREADFUL...You must be careful from unexpected mistakes and improper definitions(e.g. ""neural spine"" translated as ""transversus process"",etc.).You can only find some terms in first approximation and check them by another source.I'm a Russian- speaking doctor and NOT found any new terms,especially from holistic medicine,radiology and chiropractic. This dictionary not include pronunciation system and cross-references."
4,Cell phone battery,It worked well right away after being charged and has continued to work well with my phone.
1,Don't waste your time!!!,This battery is not worth the time and bulkiness of your phone. I can barely see the difference than the standard battery. Stick with the original
2,Battery case,The battery works great but the 'plastic' cover plate that was furnished sucks. It never fit right and now several plastic clips have broken off and now I have to tape the cover to the phone. Bad!
3,"""The Wall""",I totally enjoyed this book. I read it 3 times. It's mesmurizing. It kept pulling me back.
5,"Simple, easy, reliable","Just put it on the front-head and you can already see the temperature. You have the results in a couple of seconds. Less intrusive. No need for batteries, no electronic sensor that can go wrong like in ALL the electronic thermometers we had.This is the perfect product for us."
5,Great for newborns,"With newborn baby's tiny ears, sometimes an ear thermometer just can't do the job. You just put one of these on Baby's forehead and it'll read the temp so you don't have to deal with getting the ear thermometer, probe covers, or having to deal with holding Baby's arm down with the under arm thermometer. They are especially great in the middle of the night."
2,"Educational, but helpful for the GRE","I am utterly disappointed in the results of my Psych GRE scores even after i INTENSELY studied the Kaplan GRE Psych book, highlighted, took notes, and memorized the relevant info. that i thought would help me for the exam.While Kaplan did a superb job reviewing my psych knowledge and giving me a better and broader understanding of the branches of intro psych., it completely FAILED in preparing me for the ACTUAL GRE exam.The exam (which was about 2 months ago), did not cover ANTHING that I studied in the Kaplan book. Names, concepts, detailed questions... I was not prepared for any of the material, even though I repeatedly scored 800s on the practice test in the KAPLAN book.Anyways, just a heads up if you're considering buying or NOT buying this book."
4,An overall fun game,"I bought this game to spend time with my 5 year old son. I'm 40 years old and was an arcade expert back in the 80's, but this is my first game that I've ever bought for my computer. The animation on this is great and it's fun because you never permanently die, just temporarily blow up only to come alive again in a second or two. Although you constently kill people and blow up things, there is no blood or gore which is good for my child. There are many stages to the game and it takes some practice to get the hang of things. It does get frustrating and I have used ""help"" found on-line to get through some stages. There are many extra things in this game that you can do and I can tell right now that I may get to the end, but I'll certainly never experience the complete game. I did buy a gamepad controller because the keyboard controls were a pain, especially for my son. I like this game and my son loves it. It was a good purchase for our entry into computer gaming."
4,Star Wars 2 Lego,Game was exactly what I hoped for. It was given as a gift to my young son and we have enjoyed hours of fun playing together and talking about the game experience.It is unfortunate that the shipping and handling cost more than the game. I hesitate before ordering anything from Amazon as a result of the high shipping costs.
4,Lego Star Wars 2,"The game is alot of fun. It's more for the younger children, but I enjoy it even being much older"
2,Lego Star Wars II,"The game is a lot of fun, but the PC version has a bug in it that causes it to freeze randomly throughout the game. It is very frustrating when you can't save a lot becuase you have to start a level all over when it freezes."
3,A delight--but...,"I had little trouble installing this game, even though I had to use the patch. It's a hoot, a delight to play. Yes, you'll need to change the default controls. My gripe? The ""Save"" feature is dreadful, you can only save in highly specific situations, usually at the beginning and end of a level (unless I'm doing something wrong, always possible). But it's fairly easy to figure out and just a lot of fun to play."
3,Star Wars Game,"We got this game for our 7 year old son who has wanted it for some time. He loves the game and it has great graphics, but it is very addictive. More addictive than most video games. All our son wants to do is play it every chance he gets; always trying to get to the ""next"" level. Good game, but you need to closely monitor your child's playing time, more so than other games."
2,Sticky finish,"I have purchased two zebra tables with animal chair sets for my grandchildren. The second one, purchased a year ago, is sticky on top. The parents in the family insist that only water and mild cleansers have been used to clean the surface, but there is definitely a need for resurfacing. I have been unable to contact Briarpatch to ask them what should be used for the resurfacing. This has been very disappointing since the other table has performed well for two years. I would not risk buying this item after this experience."
4,A useful overview,"This book presents a very useful overview and explanation of RSI type symptoms. It is very readable and clear to understand and takes a refreshing approach. I had minor symptoms but it encouraged me to take them seriously and do something about them with, I am pleased to say, successful results."
4,"Great Value, though Heavy","Great all-around TV, and everything the average person could want. There's TVs out there with slightly better specs and a more recognizable brand name, but they cost hundreds and hundreds more. I'd guess that more than 95% of people couldn't tell the difference between them if you told them where to look (myself included). I only have two complaints about this TV- first, it's tough to get out of the box due to its height and weight. And second, there's now one TV out there with slightly better specs all around, that weighs maybe 40% less and costs about the same - it's a Sceptre 42"" I believe. Haven't seen it in person, but if I could do it over again, I'd have looked into that one and likely would have bought it instead."
2,your mileage may vary,"I bought this TV base on its positive reviews. And I was pretty satisfy with its performance. Both picture quality and viewing angle are comparable to much higher price units. Unfortunately my TV died within two months. The unit won't power on and I'm force to deal with olevia support. Olevia say they will ship out a power unit to me and then I have to call back to schedule a tech to install it. It's been 3 weeks and I still don't have the part. And get this, I live within 10 miles of Olevia's warehouse! Olevia support's hold time is at least 20 minuts each time you call. I say buying a olevia is more of a roll of the dice. If you get a working one then you're fine. However, if anything goes wrong with it, then be prepare to be without your TV for a long time."
4,Timex Women's Easy Reader Watch,"Very good watch for the price. However, the date number is so small as to be useless."
4,"like it, but broke","very good watch I liked it a lot, but it broke, and now I have to get a new one.Heather"
1,Beware Expedited Shipping Cost,The cost of shipping is not clear from the shopping cart.Expedited shipping doubles the price of the watch!Be very careful buying from this vendor as they did not make this extraordinary cost clear before completing the transaction.
5,just what we wanted,"My mom needed a replacement watch and this was exactly what she was seeking. We'd bought a pseudo-Timex (no indiglo, fake leather strap) at Target the day prior, but returned it once I found this on Amazon. Mom is now happy as a clam with her Timex. This is perfect for a senior lady since it's easy to read, has a durable strap and has a strong light to boot."
3,size matters,I like the watch the way it works but it disappointed me because it's too smaller than I've expected as the picture described on my thought.
5,5 star watch,"I was so happy when I got this watch. For a year or more I wanted a watch and I would describe it and I thought I could only find that type of watch in American Apparel, until I came on here and found exactly how I wanted my watch. Skinny and brown! So happy with the price I got it for as well!"
3,It is NOT what it looks like,"I bought this watch because it says it is easy to read and looks good. When I got it, I couldn't believe how small the watch is. I had seen this watch in stores, but I did not recognize it. I went on Amazon because the watches I have seen in stores looked small and cheap. This watch did not look like the one I had seen in Walmart. I couldn't believe the picture on Amazon was that watch. I sent it back and bought a different Timex watch. I spent a little more but got a watch I liked and could read."
5,AGAIN GREAT PURCHASE/Times Women's T20071 Easy Reader Watch,This is the watch I have bought for many years and as usual it isFANTASTIC. I thank TIMEX and AMAZON.COM for their great work.
3,Wife likes it,"I bought this for my wife. She likes the watch, has date and time, but she wishes the band was a little wider."
1,Battery dead in 3 months,I ordered this watch in May 2012. It is now August 2012 and the battery is dead. Beyond ridiculous. I am now shopping for another brand and I will never buy this product again.
4,Great headset for the price,"This is definetely one of the best headsets you can get for the xbox 360 and pc. Yes, it can work for both your xbox and your computer games. I love to play call of duty 4 with this headset because it allows you to hear your enemies way before they can see or hear you. Great advantage for those contests where every edge counts. The only nusiance is the wire its only one really long wire. Sometimes it gets tangled up and annoys me but it definetely worth it because there are reports that the wireless ones make a buzzing sound and they require batteries. I highly recommend this headset to everyone looking to play with an edge and without disturbing others like you parents in my case."
5,Must Have Headset,If you are into online multiplayer games and want the edge with the ability to hear every foot step and guns going off accross the map then the ear force is for you. No longer can people sneak up on you. Anyway great product and shipping was quick 5 stars.
4,Ear Force X1,The headphones work great. The sound is clear and can't be heard by anyone else in the room. The only downside is that there are a lot of wires that easily get tangled. But all in all I'm happy with the purchase.
4,sweet,"For its price these are especially amazing. You can hear everything in the game, and it helps you position enemies so much better. Must have for hardcore gamers."
2,Sound is very poor,"I bought these after my wireless 360 Communicator died. I have a wicked surround sound system attached to the 360 but I wanted the option to use headphones with a mic for XBOX live. Simply put, the sound quality of the mic and the headphones themselves is just terrible. I have no axe to grind with Turtle Beach but this is way below their usual standards.As for the cords, it is a mess. You can setup things very easily but you still have cords all over the place going to several different units. I could live with that if the sound quality was better but that is obviously not the case. If you have to have a headset for a decent price I say go ahead but don't set your expectations too high. Mine are going back. The Communicator is great for chat and almost any midrange headphones beat these in sound reproduction. For now I guess they will just have to stay separate."
4,bzgone,"I can't say that I've read the whole book but it looked pretty awesome. One warning, I didn't read the review carefully enough and I bought it thinking all of the field notes were actually from the place Patagonia. This is not the case. The writings are from the Patagonia magazine and include all areas of the world. Pretty cool if that is what you are looking for. THIS BOOK IS NOT SOLELY ABOUT PATAGONIA!"
2,Not worth the money,Not well built for a $80-90 item. My son didn't like the riding position. Connector bolt got stuck and we had to dismantle part of board to remove from stroller. Would try to get rid of it but I can't remove the connector bolt assembly from my stroller without breaking it. I do not recommend this product.
1,Didn't fit Evenflo and Gacco,Doesn't work with travel systems like Evenflo. You need a much longer board. Easy to install but doesn't seem secure.I tried with Gracco stroller and doesn't fit. The stroller bar has to be very thick to have good fit
4,Sounds right for the money.,"Very good design,you can put it the way you need it.It has a power.The sound range is a little bit limited,but it's worted."
2,"Not white, plan on using something heavy to keep it straight","I'm pretty sure that I read somewhere this was a white cord protector, not beige or ivory. It came like a beige, and it took forever to straighten out. Cutting it was easy. But the straightening out took a while, and it still isn't perfect. The tape they gave you isn't worth much, and just a fancy packing tape. Plan on using some for of 3M or velcro type tape, because the tape provided will not hold.Not very satisfied with the outcome of this product, will not buy from again. I have sense given up on thinking it'll straighten out and removed this product from my floor"
3,"does the job, but could be better","The ends won't lay flat, even after a month of use. I'd hoped I could run an extension cord and a LAN cable through it, but there's not enough room for both."
2,STATISTIC AND STRENGHT OF MATERIALS,"BOOK WAS NOT IN GOOD SHAPE, A LOT OF ANNOTATIONS AND SOME PAGES ARE FALLING APART...BUT FOR THE PRICE I VE PAID I COULD NOT EXPECT 'PERFECTION'. THANK YOU"
2,Awkward & Too long,"My husband & I decided to stay with a hand-me-down baby jogger& return this purchase to Amazon. In spite of it's strong marks with Consumer Reports, we found this jogger to be too long to be practical and thought it had a flimsy feel compared to more expensive competitors. Sometimes you get what you pay for."
2,mmmmm,"I am not thrilled with this jogger. Maybe I just got a lemon, but my jogger veers hard left. I have had my husband and his mechanic friends take a look at it, but there is no solution. Also, my jogger came without the shoulder harness strap. It doesn't seem safe to have my wiggling baby in it with only a waist buckle. My biggest issue is the reclining feature. I think this design is seriously flawed. It is hard to describe but to adjust the seat you pull a cord on the back side of the seat. When we went over a bump (during my jog) the cord slipped off, the seat reclined all the way down and my baby girl's head got caught on the cord, basically dangling her head. I was really upset by this. NOT A SAFE DESIGN FEATURE!!"
2,What they don't tell you..,"Based on price and reviews, I recently purchased this item. It shipped right away, and my husband put it together somewhat easily.However, less than 10 minutes into our first jog, I noticed the tire was not only flat, but had come off of the wheel. As it goes with an infant, it took me a few days to call InStep about the problem. They explained that it is a 2006 discontinued model, and the wheel tubes have been ""sitting too long"" and will come apart like that. I was pretty shocked that they're still readily selling and shipping this crapped out version to people!InStep is sending me three new tubes, so that we can deflate the tires, take them off, replace the tubing, and pump them back up. What a hassle.Otherwise, it seems like a decent product, though it's at a budgeted price for a reason (cheap-looking and working clasps, bare-bones feel and look).So, my suggestion is to stay away from these ticking time bombs if you've got an alternative, such as the Jeep models."
2,This is ridiculous!!!,This is ridiculous. Just put out season 2 and 3 instead of trying to soak more money out of customers and fans.
4,Great overview,I've had a copy of this book for many years and referred to it quite a bit when I wanted a quick answer to a historical question. This purchase was made for my granddaughters to use to help them see that information can be obtained in books and not just the internet!
3,The new architecture is like the old McDonalds.,Dieses Buch ist alle moderne Architektur. Die alte Architektur ist nicht hier. Das ist zu falsch. Die alten deutschen Architekten konnten aufbauen. Sie bauten feste Gebäude mit klassischer Art auf. Die neuen Gebäude sind Trödel. Deutsche Architektur ist jetzt wie McDonalds.
5,One of the best overviews.,"Morrison's book is one of the best overviews of Rockabilly History that I've read. There is nothing too indepth here, but this book is not meant to do that. Instead you get the why's and hows of early Rock and Roll, the definition of what makes Rockabilly, rockabilly. You get bio's of the major, and many minor, movers and shakers of the rock and roll movement of the 50's. This book gets your foot in the door and past Elvis into the coloured and varied history of the scene. From here you can search out bio's and records on Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran and The Rock and Roll Trio. A nice appendix included here is a listing of important Rockabilly albums and compilations that one can still find on the shelves. Now that you know the history you know what records to buy to experiance that history."
2,A Disappointment,"This might have been a pretty good article, but there is just not enough interesting material for a book on the subject. Most of these guys were working class amateurs who made a couple of records. I have listened to a number of compilations that include many of the people that the author mentions. Believe me, there are no lost ""masters"" among them. The author cannot even really define ""rockabilly"" in any coherent fashion, and many of his judgments appear quite arbitrary. A short-lived, transitional phenomenon. Not worth the price unless you are a fanatic fan of the music."
5,Model bushes,"Easy to use , lots of fun . wish there was a little more to the packet though , not sutable for children under 8 yrs old unless adult supervision ."
5,Paxify your life,"Pax 217 brings a new and fresh sound that you can't stop listening to. When I first got the cd I listened to nothing else for 2 1/2 months! My personal favorites are, well, actually I like every single song on the entire cd. Each song has a way of growing on you and becoming your new favorite till you love wvery song. I just got the chance to see them in concert at Creation West and was so phsyched! i got to talk with Josh (bass player) and he was totally real and humble that it was shocking. Anyways, give them a listen and enjoy!"
3,Accumold 7326,"I bought this hold to hold my Streamlight Strion light. Works fine as a holder, but if you want something that will protect your light this will not do."
5,Works perfectly for my flashlight,"The flashlight I use is a CREE Ultra Fire C2. It holds it well not too tight not too loose. If you google the flashlight you'll notice the head of it where the LED is, is rather large. It slides right in and rests on the top of the flashlight holder, I give it a little tug from the bottom where the button is and it stays right there even when I'm running. I placed this near the center of my duty belt so it is located behind me just to the left of my spine. I'm very happy with it."
4,Thoughtful and unique,"Shades of Romeo and Juliet, mixed with Alice in Wonderland and a bit of pulp AD&D savagery, shake well... Juliana and Orlando fled the feud between their noble families two years ago, into the Cave of Echoes, and were never heard from again. Now, the PCs (levels 4-7) must delve into this mystic faerie realm in search of a courageous revelation that will impress you. A forgotten World of Greyhawk classic, recommended."
5,awesome!,"great lyrics, intense music. it is the type of music you really have to focus on and is very intelligent. i love it!"
2,Not quite as described,The descriptions imply all actions are done on Bosu and that is inaccurate. Only some of the sculpting moves are done on Bosu. It's probably an okay DVD but not what I wanted.
2,Slow...,"It had a good plot and likeable characters but it was slow! It wasn't until page 300 that you found out what the book was even about, it just rambled on about some stupid affair."
2,Get to the POINT!,"Like many others before me, I kept waiting for something of interest to happen. By this time you are 300+ pages into the book and must complete it in anticipation of an exciting and meaningful conclusion. But the ending chapters made me wish I had stopped reading after page 300. What do all these references to the Catholic church mean to the plot? Very little, except to alter one point in the trial. I was looking for an alternative to Grisham and Tudrow as far as courtroom suspense novels: this book is not in the same class. One other point to Amazon, why do you allow another reviewer to reveal the ending of this book?!? I have been very upset to see the 'surprise' ending of several books listed in other reviews. Please delete such non-sense."
1,"This book is terrible, don't waste your time.","This book is just awful. The characters are only half-constructed. The dialogue and other passages are written in convoluted, fragmented sentences making it a VERY slow read. It is predictable; you know who did it before you even get to the murders. The characters are so cliched and tired. The cheating, racist, alcoholic lawyer; the compulsive do-gooder prospective lawyer with the troubled past; the divorcing best friend; the troubled cop. So overdone. If Mr. Lescroart's other boooks are anything like this one, he's almost used up his 15 minutes. Also, it's too obvious that Mr. Lescroart is not a lawyer nor is he too familiar with the legal system as a whole. He fills up his dialogue with legalese and jargon to make up for the fact that he doesn't have much of a plot. Twiddle your thumbs and wait for the next John Grisham."
1,Not a good mystery,This book is too hard to follow. The plot is more into personal relationships than crime and would be better served in the romance novel section of a bookstore. It is one of the worst mysteries I have ever read. The crime part doesn't begin to happen until halfway through the bookThis book is not worth the noney.
5,Love! Love! This item is a life saver!,"I could not wait until something like things came out, I was thinking of a product that does the same thing that I can create but when I saw Mr Clean came out with it I was very happy. Now that I have had my item for awhile it seems the stores are not caring the refills. This is the second item I have bought by Mr Clean and for some odd reason the stores stop carying the refills. I am glad there online but it very inconvienent to purchase items not in hands reach."
1,Company is a rip-off,"This company Kat's Sales is a rip off, I purchased Mr Clean's Magic Reach Scrubbing Tub & Showers Pad and was overcharged for 1 package of 8 $34.95."
1,Very Difficult....,I'm usually very good with any computer program. This program is complicated and a lot of work. Audio sounds like cheap midi...couldn't get real instrument audio despite all attempts. Very disappointed.
4,Very few things are sweet,"The words in this book tend to flow like poetry. The subject matter is very heavy, with very few sweet things included. There is enough scandal and drama for even the most hardcore enthusiast. I can hardly wait to sample more of Roslyn Carrington's work."
4,Better than you think,"I've had this book for years, and really have gotten a lot out of it. It talks about confronting your fears in your dreams, and the important of the dream life to various cultures. If you are a magick user or pagan, you would probably enjoy this book. I was prompted to write this review when I read below that some people think she's an idiot... I thought she did a very good job.This is a book about dream control. It's worth the ten bucks."
2,Misleading,What you see is not what you get. Read carefully. I bought something better for much less more on craigslist.
3,Not compatible with HP PSC 2110,"Small, compact design with very simple installation instructions and great customer support when I called for assistance. Unfortunately, this device is not compatible with all USB printers and it deleted my HP printer driver when I tried to use it."
4,Adequate Print server,"This print server works well. Very easy to set up. The only con (reason for not giving it 5 stars) is that it you have a power interuption, you have to reestablish the connection from the computer to the server, but it is very easy to do it. If you are looking for a server, I would recommend this one."
3,network,Worked to allow me to use a printer that was not network ready. Most printer now have network software in them now.
5,worked with my samsung ML-2010,"If you are not sure it worked with your printer, mine is ML-2010 from Samsung and it worked like a charm. Set up took 10 min max!"
1,Non-compatible,"From the description, this printer adapter sounded like it would work. However, I was wrong. Probably my fault but be careful to make sure your system is compatible before purchasing. Good news is, Amazon made it easy to return."
5,Excellent product,I bought this product as a Gift for a friend who loves making creme brulee. I had personally purchased a different set of creme brulee dishes but they weren't exactly what I wanted. These are the perfect size for individual servings and look exactly the same as the dishes used at the cafe where I live. I will more than likely purchase more of these in the future.
4,Timex Men's Watch,"Purchased as gift. Pleased with product, attractive looking, received promptly. Only complaint has been when date changes."
2,"Some interesting stuff along the way, but a lousy ending...","I enjoyed various things in the book, but the ending is really terrible: lots of loose ends, unsatisfying, etc. Wish he had been able to bring it off..."
1,A huge disappointment,"I bought this after reading a glowing review that mentioned Paul Auster, whom I like. Unfortunately, this is a somewhat entertaining story marred throughout by bad writing. A character in ""Codex"" references ""The Name of the Rose"" by Umberto Eco (both books share a similar theme at one point) which only serves to remind you the reader of how ""Codex"" pales in comparison to a really good book."
2,"Well-written, but lacking a substantive plot","After finishing Codex last night I found myself still waiting for the plot to kick in. Lev Grossman has a talent for character creation - and the characters in Codex are interesting with good internal conflict - but I think he should have spent a little more time developing a better plot line.Even though I can't recommend Codex, I will give his next novel a read."
3,Intriguing to start and then it goes downhill,"When I stared reading, I found myself comparing this book to the DaVinci Code and liking it better. But then the characters started to grate on me. By the time I reached the disappointing end I was totally uninterested in the plot. In fact it doesn't really end, it sort of fizzles out. The parts of the story dealing with the study of old books made very worthwhile reading. Without them this book might have gotten one star."
2,Thank god this was a $5 bargain bin find....,"I have to agree with the last review. The first 3/4 of the book was good (I'd say great, if not for the horrible editing job). The last 1/4 of the book? Non-existent. The plot went from thrilling to unimaginative in about 2 seconds flat. It seemed as if the author lost his total train of thought against a deadline and typed up the first quick ending he could think of. There are so many holes in the story. (SPOILER ALERT!!) Why was Margaret seen with the Duke at the airport in the end? And why is the Duchess so contradicting in the end? Yes, she's a kook, but... It just didn't make sense. For an author to be so thorough in the beginning, the end of this so called novel was a huge let down. Don't waste your money on this book unless you want to re-write the ending yourself."
1,Read The Davinci Code again!!!,"I bought this book at a library sale and paid $1.00 for it -- I overpaid! At least the library benefited. Read the reviews that are negative (NOT the ""professional"" reviews but the ones in this section) to get a real feeling for how bad this novel is. To me the unforgivable part was not tying together things that are emphasized in the book at the (more than) disappointing conclusion.Don't invest your time."
3,Could've been better,"While I enjoy his writing style for the most part, I'm finding his books to be a slight let down after I've finished (yet I keep reading them). The endings always leave me going, ""Huh?!"", ""Why?!"". This was no different. It had such a huge buildup and I expected more. Grrrrr! I'd still recommend it though to friends because then I can discuss it and share my frustrations with them, and ask about Margaret. ;-)"
2,boring!!,"Stay away from this one. Cool ideas but, you are waiting for something to happen and it never does."
1,Not well thought out or written,"Although Mr. Grossman seems to start out with a winner here, as you progress furthur you will find a book that is not well laid out, fleshed out, or finished well. It seems that the author wants to let the reader flesh out too much in their own mind that should actually be provided in the book itself.It seems Mr. Grossman is in the habit of touching only briefly items and characters that should be much better explained in order to be properly placed in the stories his books are trying to tell.I have also read a few of his articles he has written for magazines and find he does not care to research his topics too well in his non-fiction work either.I believe I'll read other authors works in the future, to me it is preferable to know the reasons and direction a story is taking rather than to try to guess and fill in as I go along."
2,Could have been so much better,"This had the potential to really amount to something. Good premise, but the author either ran out of steam or couldn't figure out how to link the computer game story line into the codex story line. What was the purpose? It was really a distraction rather than an enhancement. Has to be one of the worst endings I ever read. I went back and reread the last pages trying to figure out if I missed something or if there were pages missing. It wasn't just a ""twist"", it was a letdown at best and a non-ending at the worst. Do not waste your time ..."
1,Terrible,"If you're thinking that this book could be as entertaining as the Da Vinci Code, you're sorely mistaken. The plot consists of the main characters getting frustrated that their library book is missing. That's about it. The plot was so anti-clamactic. The reviewers quoted in the front of the book were probably friends of Lev, who coincidentally enough, writes reviews for at least two of those publications (""New York Times"" and ""Time Out New York""). Do you think there's a conflict of interest, perhaps?"
1,Too busy being cute,This writer needs to get a clue. This book is not worth your money or the time it takes to read. Better yet buy my copy from me and save me from throwing in the fire 73 Lev
1,Boring.,This is a faintly embarrassing book on the order of tiddlywinks and snail collecting. I would recommend a Ham Radio or Stamp Collecting book instead.
2,NOT what is pictured,"I purchased this stuffed cow kit as a replacement stuffed animal for my son. His daddy had purchased the cow pictured back in 2003, and with all the loving he's gotten, it is falling apart. I am VERY disappointed that this company has a picture up of the OLD cow, and actually mailed out something that doesn't look or feel anything like the cow in the picture. Amazon assures me that they will correct the picture to represent the animal actually for sale, but I now have to start my search again!"
2,The old system was much more reliable...,"I have used Innotek systems for many years. They no longer supported the old system so I upgraded to the Ultra Smart system. I had the old rechargeable system in operation for 8 years and never had a problem. If you go with this new system you can count on replacing collars every year as they fail to hold a charge. To there credit, the company replaces any collars that fail within the year, but after that its $40.00 with the return of the old one. I have gone through more that six collars to date and think I will try another system rather than replace the latest two collars that have failed. While it has all the features, the best system in the world is not worth a dime if it is dead."
4,For the price and my old eyes it was well worth it,I am on my second one now. Easy to read. The face scratches somewhat easily though. The light works great. I used baseball glove conditioner on the band to prolong its life.
4,Good watch but can be loud,"Delivery was on time. Watch band is smooth and nice but not necessarily soft; however, it feels nice on the skin. Wrist band is good length and my hubby has small wrists, so it works out great.The ticking sound can be loud in quiet room. Room with some sound noise may be OK.Adjusting the day was difficult. You have to adjust the time in 24 hour increment in order to move the day forward. That is a hassle. But I guess once it is all adjusted then there wouldn't be an issue anymore.To change the date, just pull the dial out once. Pull the dial out twice would be for adjusting the time.Overall it seems to be a good daily watch."
2,"Love the way it looks, but after three replacements it has poor quality","I really like the way this watch looked, and I am disappointed that I haven't been able to get one that wasn't defective. So far, I have had three defective movements. The first one would lose an hour a week. The second one stopped randomly. The third one did not have a working Indiglo light. Seems like a nice watch, but with poor quality control."
3,"Not Great, But Better Than Nothing!","The watch looks nice, but the leather band is not very durable and the mechanics (plastic) are cheap....Setting the day/date is a mystery - sometimes it works, but never on the first try. The stem was stuck and couldn't be repaired. This watch is twice as good as the $10. watches you can sometimes find at Walmart or Walgreens, but it's not really worth nearly 3X as much. Just the same, this is the third time I have bought this watch from Amazon...I hope it will last at least 1 year, then I'll prob. buy another one. (I don't enjoy shopping around....creature of habit)."
5,Great watch,I purchased this watch for my husband's trip to Israel. Travel organizers said dependable watch is a must.My husband had no trouble with watch during his time on his trip and also has had no trouble since his return.
3,SETTING DAY/DATE,"SETTING THE DAY AND DATE ON THE WATCH IS VERY DIFFICULT, ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO HAVE ARTHRITIS IN THEIR HANDS."
1,Very Difficult to Set,"Watch was delivered on Wed, Oct 28th. The watch was set at Fri 4th. It took 20 minutes and a LOT of finger friction to get it set to the proper date. Then you have to turn it backwards (counterclockwise) to set the day, and it turns backward at about 5 min per spin of the stem. WHAT A PAIN! Timex needs to come up with a better mechanism for setting dates/times. Then the instructions say you have to set the date every month. Why not just the months which don't have 31 days? The leather band is thick and not very supple. Maybe it will improve with wear. The bill was stuck to the top of the box and ripped when the box was opened. It was difficult to pry the watch off the plastic display holder. The holder broke in the process."
1,Terrible quality,"The moment I picked up this product, I could tell it is of extremely low quality. The time is nearly impossible to change with its tiny nob for adjusting the time. The winding pin is supposed to have two settings but it is so cheap that I couldn't find the second setting. The winding pin actually comes out if you pull it out too far, cant believe Timex couldn't design it so that the pin won't come out. Piece of garbage."
1,Timed watch,We could not get the features set. We could not coordinate the date with the day of the week. Would have to reset on every 30-day month. Long difficult procedure. Not worth going through this every month. Need to return it.
4,Love it,I enjoy this watch it has that classic look to it thats why I got it. If you are looking for a simple watch this will do shows time day and date.Note- The ticking can be loud at times but I don't really mind
3,The trial of Henry Kissinger,Being a follower of Mr Hitchens for reasons other than his political views I was expecting more of the writing style that I had grown acustomed to from the good few other books I have read written by him.However if my assumption is correct that the purpose of the book was to document a case against Kissinger then I suppose the book succeeded in its objective to the extent that the subject seems to have been properly researched and would be of court room assistance should the man ever be brought to trail in actual real life.There is none of the usual enjoyable Hitchensque rhetoric and I found it all rather bland.I would not reccomend it as a pleasurable evening read.
2,Overblown Kissinger Book By A Super Liberal,This book is not very objective. Although it tries very persuasively to demonize Henry Kissinger. The Vietnam War was different than World War II as it is different than the War on Terror. So some anologies apply but not all. History has shown that the bombings of Cambodia and Laos lead to the ending of the Vietnam War. Those decisions were just as important as Clinton's bombing decisions in Bosnia that changed the course of history there.
1,"Awful, nail through the eye ball bad","As a huge fan of lovecraft i figured that no matter how bad this was it would be midly entertaining. i was so horribly wrong. It reminded of a book that should be on Mystery Science Theatre 3000. The plot is obvious, and awkward. The characters are dreadful and under developed, the villians should have had snidley whiplash mustaches. this book was so bad i called my sister and read her lines like ""the Lettuce had not aged like fine wine"". I can imagine this book being written by a computer, or someone who owed a bookie. however if you want to read a Hilariously bad book this is the closest ive found to recreating the ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" effect. i would have stopped reading it but i was 200mi away from another book store and i kept thinking that something this bad couldnt have actually gotten printed. It did. the best way to read this book would be to cut out your eyes and stuff the pages in the gaping wounds. awful"
5,Retro Looking Phone,This was a Christmas gift. They liked it so well they ordered the blue color as well for another bedroom.
4,A tale of two cultures,"I find the title interesting to learn of Pocahontas, the native American girl who risked her head to spare the one of John Smith, the British settler. The eye-sight of Pocahontas on Smith sparked a romance. The inter-marriage between European lords certainly worked anywhere to strengthen powerful alliance. America would have been different if it were developed that way.Smith after a gun-powder accident went back to English.Rumored that Smith died, the settlers in Jamestown lied to Pocahontas who married and had a son and went to England. She even was a model to advertise and promote business to Virginia. She was heart-broken when Smith visited her. She died months later.It was a romantic legend for over four centuries. Will we have a different outcome if English settlers formed an alliance with native Americans? This documentary traces the site and brings back a chapter in history."
5,Just what I was looking for,I have a salon and was needing a container for the needles from our permanent make up services. This is just right!
1,0 rating,"THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT I'VE EVER BOUGHT! IT'S OLD, IT DOESNT WORK PROPERLY. THE AD SAID NEW, IT WASNT NEW AT ALL. NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE. I'LL NEVER TRUST THIS VENDER AGAIN."
1,Never Buy a Kodak Digital Camera Again,"I bought this camera for my daughter for xmas 2004, so it is a little over 1 year old. At the time I thought it was a good value and purchased it instead of an olympus or sony which cost slightly more. Now a little over a year later, the display does no longer works and it will not take any pictures. Of course it is off warrenty, so I went to the Kodak website to see what it would cost to fix it. Their quote was $110....more than the advertised cost on Amazon to buy a new one. If this is any indication of how they are going to compete in the digital market, they will never survive. I am going to replace this camera, but not with a Kodak."
4,It'll Make You Smile,"Mildly amusing satire of a California teen beauty pageant set in the mid 70's. Though this movie is consistently funny it lacks that extra bite that classic satire would have. I'm sure when this film came out in 1975 it resonated more because of society's changing mores and these type of institutions would have been prime targets. That said, there is an underlying gentleness to this film and it does not condescend to the characters. It also has a quasi-documentary feel to it. This film definitely evokes a specific time and place in our country's social history. It should also be noted that the film's nominal star, Bruce Dern, does not play one of those psychos that he was typecast as at that time."
4,Only fools and viagra,"Set in New York, this is a fast moving,easy to read, contemporary novel.you can imagine it as an episode of ""only fools and horses"" with its very wry humour,or indeed as a motion picture starring Hugh Grant (as Zack).Look out for mayhem in the doctors surgery,and madness on the golf course.This is the first time i have read this author and i will be on the lookout for his other works!Highly recommended!"
3,Everything Changes- in a good way,"I have read most of Trooper's published books and this is a pretty good read. Entertaining and fairly light, this is an interesting look at love, guilt, family, and the usual fare of Tropper's books-the 27-34 year old male looking for the right path. He has done it better in How to Talk to a Widower and with better descriptive phrases in the Book of Joe but this is still a solid book. Those who are fans of the Man/Boy books of Trooper will enjoy them. Those who have worked in corporate jobs, ala Office Space, will enjoy the send up of mid corporate level work. Honestly, I would liek to give the book 3 and a half stars rather than three. My only dislike was not looking deeper into the psychological depths of the main characters infatuation to see the healthiness of the relationship. Read it, though, and make up your own mind."
3,1 or 2 versions,Is there 1 or 2 versions ? I need the blue cover like the double album. I bought 2 cds . both the other version. There are completly different song listing.
3,"Surprisingly well produced, but at best a novelty item","I guess that one shouldn't be surprised that someone with as much production experience as Mousse T can put together a very professionally, and even innovatively produced swing/funk album (which is what this is), but for some reason at the end of each track you are a little surprised that it didn't trainwreck at some point.The stand out tracks are definitely the swing re-work of Mousse T's own club house hits 'Horny' (which has great instrumentation, and is sung pretty well by a sultry-voiced singer who has a surprising talent for phrasing) and 'Fire'. 'Sex Bomb' is also particularly well arranged. I can take or leave the rest, however.In my opinion, 3 stars at best - there's novelty value in hearing a house DJ putting together swing versions of well-known tunes, but it is limited. And, hey, didn't Frank Bennett do all this 5 year ago?"
2,A fluffy promotional piece,"I really enjoyed reading Buck's first book, The Faraway Horses and really liked Buck the movie. I was looking forward to reading this book and thought since each chapter was about overcoming a specific issue he would talk about how to work through those issues. Instead, it was a series of stories people had written Buck about how great he is and how they helped to changed their lives prefaced by Buck's commentary on the story. There is nothing deep or substantial to the book, just a lot of fluff. Some of the ""lessons learned"" were repeats from his first book. It's a light read but if you want to borrow it from friend or the library but I wouldn't buy it as I would not read it a second time."
5,self help,"After reading The Faraway Horses, I had to read Believe. It is a nice compilation of stories from some of Buck Brannaman's students. I would recommend it to anyone, as it is a comforting book that restores hope. Knowing there are people learning from Buck how to peacefully treat horses and fellow humans is heartwarming."
2,Cheap...not pleased,"I purchased the Storkcraft furnature for my daugher's room, after over a year of use I am really disappointed in this furnature. The finsh scratches really easily, the drawer gliders are coming apart, this is just very cheaply made. I wish I would have purchased something else."
1,Total crap.,"It's wobbly, the drawers don't line up and the ""wood"" is cheap looking - the drawer bottoms are nothing but a heavy piece of paperboard - the stuff that is tacked on to the back of Ikea bookshelves to make them look finished? Yeah, so don't plan on the drawers holding anything heavy. Not that baby clothes are heavy, but you should know that these just will not hold up over the long run.All in all I think it took us about 3 hours to put together and it's just plain crap. I wish I had a more eloquent way to say it.Other items we purchased for the nursery went together smoothly and are sturdy so I know it's not our assembly skills at fault here - this chest of drawers is just not made very well. I really wish I had spent more and gotten something that will last or at least not wobble every time I touch it!"
2,poor quality,It was hard to put together because the parts were not labeled. When moving the object it started to crack on one side and had a scratch on it already.
1,Terrible,"I wish I could give this dresser a 0 rating as it is the worst quality dresser I have ever seen. My husband had to replace all of the rails with new ones from home depot, we had to use wood glue on the knobs, and it scratches SO easily. Its truely horrible. Truth be told, the dresser that I got in a nursery set for my first, from walmart that cost me 200$ total is a much better quality dresser than this one. That set came with a crib, changing table, and dresser- all for 200$. I will never buy from stork craft again."
3,Stork Craft Dresser,I purchased the Stork Craft Beatrice 4 Drawer Chest in Black. I was a bit worried when I first ordered this product. I had read the reviews and they were not all that positive. The dresser has a very strong odor which I am assuming is from the paint. It is a good idea to put this together before baby gets there so it has time to air out. I don't have too many complaints.One of the bottom drawers is a little crooked and catches on the last drawer and pulls it out tho. My boyfriend put the drawers together using wood glue. So hopefully that will make them last a little longer. Overall I like the product. It looks very beautiful once it is assembled and goes beautifully with the other furniture we purchased from Stork Craft.
2,Missing Parts,"This was very labor intensive to put together, especially since one of the drawer bottoms was missing from the box. The back of the dresser was compressed cardboard. Our son picked it out, I ordered it and grandpa put it together. We were not impressed."
3,Stork Craft Beatrice 4 Drawer Chest,"Product came with instructions for a 3 drawer unit, had extra parts, holes for KD fittings were too large so fittings fell out during assembly making assembly difficult at times...for the price was not near the quality a product that one would expect. Once completely assembled was fairly sturdy but don't expect it might be a long term investment."
5,"Great value, easy assembly","The dresser arrived on time and in good shape. The outer box was pretty ragged, but it was wrapped to sustain that kind of handling. There were enough layers that there was zero damage to the pieces.)Its a beautiful chest of drawers, the color was true to the photo, and while the assembly of flat pack furniture is never pleasant, it was easy enough and didn't involve too much cursing or yelling... my husband and I are still married.It isn't a huge dresser, but its not meant to be.Exactly what we were looking for!"
1,"""cr*p on a stick"" is too kind for ""Outlaw Prophet""","I rented this once, and I swear I got stupider watching it. If you are a humanitarian, buy this horrible, horrible movie, and burn it _UNWATCHED_ as a favor to the world. It has no discernible plot, bad acting, a music video? thrown in for no apparent reason I could find (it's even a dumb music video), and then tosses in something about the devil and television just to really cap the whole thing off. That guy who wrote before me? And suggested watching paint dry before this stupid waste of a tape? Seriously. The paint would be better. I wish I could give this negative stars."
5,Pricey but excellent,"The product is very easy to apply. I used it once after I got it about two months ago. Rain water still beads up like the day after I used it. Ragg Top claims the protection lasts up to six months depending on how intense the sun is in your area. Living in Buffalo ny, I believe it will last even longer. It's worth every penny."
4,worked well,This product was recommended by the company that installed a replacement top on my Mustang convertible. It did make the top look better and repelled some dirt
4,Worth Repeated Listens,"If you like Blues Traveller or Lenny Kravitz you'll like this disc. Moore's lyrical and musical direction is similar. They are equally adept at doing swaggering blues-rock, as exemplified on songs like ""Muddy Jesus"" (this is one to put on repeat), and ""Train Tracks"". Their mellow, almost folksy ballad, ""Daggers"" is a highlight here, though not the only mellow tune."
4,A great supplement to the Official GMAT,"While I used the Official GMAT as the core of my study efforts, this book is a great supplement, it helps you understand how to think about the questions. I highly recommend using this, I think it helped me with my prep for the GMAT"
3,Good Quality for my Textbook,"I like purchasing textbooks here, they are reliable, and the quality is usually up to my standards. I can't say I 100% enjoy reading textbooks, but it's better than selling my firstborn at the local bookstore."
5,"Great Book, By Brilliant Combat Photog","This is a book that every photojournalist, press photographer, or combat cameraman should own. The works of Tim Page, not only highlight the personl hell that or soldiers msut endure in a time of war, but also those journalist who risk thier own lives in order bring home the story of our brave men and women who fight for their country."
1,why should I buy this Vince?,"Ok, one question..WHY Should I buy this.. I record RAW each week..I buy all the PPVS, so I already have all the footage....So, why should I buy this Vince? For the DX packaging? to have everything in one place so I dont have to do it myself...? I will take a pass on this one just because I already have it..."
5,"a ""must read"" for scifi lovers",the best book I have ever read that deals with the impact cloning would have on a society.
2,"Good parts, but mostly word-gravel","I tried to read this book, but after 110 rather lugubriouspages I just gave up. There were moments when Cherryh gripped myattention, but only moments. I didn't think all that elaborate description of the government and genetics laboratories was necessary. It would have been much better if she had described the background only when it was necessary in order to understand the story. In Orson Scott Card's Ender series, for example, Card never actually describes what the Starways Congress is, or even what it does, suffice to say that it is a powerful political organization, apparently with the authority to have its own navy. That way, our minds don't clutter with unnecessary information. A good effort, but a bit too descriptive."
2,Nothing that I expected.,"This book in my opinion will not help you pass the written test. I took and passed my test on the first attempt, but I also read the book before this book was realeased and one other CCIE book. This book basically gives you summaries of each topic. If you are weak in a subject this book will not enhance your knowledge in that area, you are better off going back to your CCNA and CCNP book.Best of luck"
1,"Dr. Seuss is Spinning in his grave, again.......","Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas was a nice little story, so how about just giving your kids the book to read instead of buying this slapped together piece of detritus. The game is a complete waste of money and programming time. The irony of this situation (a multi-million dollar movie and a hastilly constructed game centered around a story about the over-commercialization of Xmas) is really funny and sad at the same time."
1,What a waste...wish I could give 0 stars,"The graphics are awful, it only works 2 or 3 times until you have to reinstall it, and it installs BETA software on your system. Don't waste your time or money."
4,Over average,"Mattie, the main character of this novel, has issues that resulted from the way her father cared for her. She felt as if she was nothing, and mirrors helped her see if shes really there. Everyone in this novel was touched by Dominic, her pops. This book is original to me. Dominic wounded everyone around his finger, and the was still under his spell after he died. Jonah saw him as a father figure and mimiced his ways but later on he discovers he's not Dominic and has to coup with it.Some authors put tooo much drama in their novels, in this one there's not as much and it still kept your attention. It's worth reading."
4,education in corrections,"I'm Deputy, I have founded that new employees and old employees share commmon mistake about the Corrections Field, you can never know enough about prisoners. The Dictionary is a great start, and reminder of who we deal with every day."
1,Did not fit,"The holes were very much off and I had to scramble to buy one elsewhere..i sent this one back, but I have yet to see a refund..A minimal loss."
4,Fun,A nice look at her comedy and history. She haben an continues to be a major contributor to the lesbian and gay culture. An acute sense of politics and the climate. A very funny woman.
4,Elegant Appetizer Pics,"Pics came quickly, were nice and sharp to pierce vegetables,clean and well packaged.Only negative was the knots unwound easily while skewering vegetables and not easily reknoted."
4,Buy It Now While You Can,I grew in up the Philadelphia area and remember that WDAS played this song often.. You can not download this from iTunes or other online music sources. Thank you for offering.
3,to the teeth,"i love ani, so don't get me wrong, but this is not her greatest cd ever. There are some good moments like going once, swing, and to the teeth, but freakshow ruins everything. I can't even stand to hear that one...prince joins her on providence, but only as background vocals. this is not my favorite, but is worth listening to, just don't expect the little folksinger and her guitar."
2,Miss the old days!,"While I respect Ani DiFranco's music and her mission, I miss her old style. There is nothing like the first album.... I long for the old days of a woman and her guiter. She could make magic."
5,Different but that's what i like,"I was standing in the music store listening to the album which was to my surprise on display. At first listen I didn't really like the songs. But when I brought it home I read the lyrics and re-listened to it. I like some songs better than other, and sometimes skip some. But I truly do appreciate each and every song and the fact that Ani is evolving like most artists do and expanding with her music. I like the guitar playing on older albums. But now she's adding to that other musicians and instruments and even deeper lyrics."
5,there are no words as to how wonderful ian is,"i was first introduced to Ian's music about 4 years ago and I became absolutly hooked. The first song I ever hear of his was ""nothing"" off his self-titled cd. The rest of the songs that followed were even better. I actually went to a show of his last night and am listening to a CD from another show that I went to back in 2004. He never fails to impress me. my pen name ""obsidian-stone"" is actually from one of his songs, Cinnamon""...So your body is blushingLike blood from a rose.And it's zipless,And it's perfectLike obsidian stone.From the flesh of the old skin,To the secrets within,Here within...""I urge everyone to check out a live show becuase he talks between numbers and is entertaining without meaning to be. He doesn't need to try. all he needs is his guitar and his voice. his talent does the rest."
1,Mistake,When I ordered this cd I didn't know that it was instrumental only. I thought I was ordering a cd with lyrics. This cd will probably never be played.
3,Cow headed man in underwear dog getting whipped against a store front window isn't as entertaining as it sounds...,Well First let me say i love takashi miike movies everyone i have seen i have loved...except this one and Vistor Q...This is very drawn out and the violence comes maybe every 1/2 hr or so witch is very slow for a takashi movie.I wouldn't call it imataion as some would say but I would say takashi was slackin in this movie. But really who can top audition ichi the killer and dead or alive. As fans I suppose its our duty if you will not to compare these to his newer films because there is no real way to top em. But it still leaves you thinking this movie could be better.As far as the all shocking ending yeah its nasty lol but completly un-realalistic and for me it ruined the shock value. if your just introducing yourself to takashi there are films you have too see before this one or you may get the wrong idea of his films. Not a bad movie just not takashi to his fullest potential.
5,The best scientific study of how and why pyramids work.,"Excellent insight to mangetic form resonance, tensor fields scalar energies and topological electronics. Flanagan is a true genius and his discoveries continue to subtly shape our world. Fifty years from now, this book will be a classic because it describes lesser-known technologies that will hopefully be second nature to future generations. I am a researcher and have had tremendous results because of the impact of this book, and also other researches of Dr. Flanagan."
2,Water Resistant? My A--!,"The ad claims that the watch is water ""resistant"" to something like 90 feet. I bought it because I was canoeing the Buffalo River last weekend.I didn't want to risk my old (30 years) Rolex Datejust.As expected we capsized in 4 feet of water. I recovered immediately. Watch was no deeper than 3 feet max. It fogged up under the crystal and was unreadable for 2 days. It has since cleared up as I put it in a bag of rice to suck out the moisture. (Old folk trick-worked on my cell and digital camera too).Watch still keeps good time. How long????? Just don't belief that ""water resitant"" B.S. OK to wear for Methodist christenings."
5,Getting its use!,"Great encyclopedic reference. This book was my second and I like it best - even after the third and fourth book on crystals. It got me interested in and aware of more gem stones and crystals. Not every one is mentioned, but they DO have quite a number of unusual stones included. I take a gander at the Internet for what I can't find in this book. Neat stuff."
1,Very bad journalism...,"So biaised, so unprecise, so wicked, so 'un-scientific'... really surprised that OUP is publishing this piece of very bad journalism."
5,Just When You Think There Ain't Enough Killing in Movies,"Enter The Hall Monitor.I saw this gem at some flim flam festival in Atlantic City and it made feel a whole lot better about losing all my money. I've been looking for it ever since 1999. . . and finally, here it is.Now I can finally prove to my friends that I wasn't dreaming about the flick with the best frog dissection scene ever.This movie is funny and funny."
2,Just OK,We were disappointed in this fixture. It had several bent areas around the individual light fixtures that needed to be re-shaped and it does NOT take 100 watt bulbs. The sticker on the fixture says 60 watt max to avoid fire. The glass shades are nice and it looks ok.
3,Royal Rumble takes a royal tumble,The 2007 royal rumble was overall disappointment for several reasons. Those reasons have to do with the matches which were on the card. Batista vs. kennedy was not that exciting for me. I dont understand why wwe insists on pushing kennedy so much. (trying to create the next big star perhaps?)Last man standing featuring Cena vs. umaga was ok. It had its good moments and slow points. The only good match of the night was the royal rumble itself. The final two stars remaining were taker and hbk. HBK attempted to eliminate taker with a superkick but taker countered by lifting micheals up on his shoulders and throwing him over the top rope and out of the ring. I did like that wwe decided to go back to leaving the rumble match for last( as it should be every year). I would find a way to see only the rumble match itself and skip the undercard stuff. I cant strongly recommend buying this one. Thanks for reading. OUT
2,CONFUSED,"I CAN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT THE BOOK BECAUSE I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ALL THE BOOKS THAT SHOULD GO WITH IT. I RECEIVED THE WORK BOOK BUT NOT THE STUDENT BOOK. HOWEVER, IT LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE A GREAT STUDY TOOL TO HELP LEARN ENGLISH. PLEASE REMEMBER I TRULY DON'T KNOW SINCE I DON'T HAVE ALL MY BOOKS......"
4,4 stars because they never broke or anything.,"I bought from a couple different brands when I purchased these so my boyfriend at the time could tell me which he liked best. Although he said it was pretty much all the same, I think these were his least favorite out of the ones I bought (Beyond Seven and Crown were the other two I tred). He didn't say anything bad about them, but he usually grabbed Beyond Seven whenever we needed them. These were the ones that were left over after the other brands had been used."
2,"not a fitted t-shirt, so a little big but a fun gift all the same","I bought this for a friend's bridal shower. It is not a fitted t-shirt and the sizes run large, but fun all the same."
2,Not as represented,"Happy with the book as this is a gift for my wife and her favorite childhood book. Would have spent twice as much for what I would consider ""good"" condition. Book very used."
5,So much eisier than yugioh!,"Like many Yugioh fans I did not want to try this game. It looked stupid and of course my friend got me into it. Duel masters is really easy to learn because ther are only 3 parts in a turn: draw phase, mana, and battle phase. It is great to start to play now because the cards are cheaper than Yugioh cards. Duel msters also has better looking creaters and they are alot stronger. And you don't even have to attack your opponents creatures like in yugioh. You can go staight for the shields. The best thing of all thogh is during the game you get to say three japaneese words.Yoshi: I ecept your challenge.Ekay: break a shieldand best of all when your opponent has no shields, Toe Dome a Da: Final attack and you win! Better than yugioh!"
3,another Freestyle comp,"I do love Freestyle , I just wish There were more maxi-singles or full-lengths from their comps.This yet another compiliation of Freestyle songs that have the tradionally Freestyle sound, but needs a little more flavor.The spanish freestyle song by Joanna has potential as a single and all the others sound a little similiar.This is just a barely passable comp."
1,Just read the book,"I love Gary Dourdan, but this movie rendition of the book was terrible. Bad acting, bad editing, just BAD. Do not even bother buying this, renting, or wasting your time watching this because you will be SORRY. Like I was."
3,"Interesting enough story, terrible writer","This book needed a strong editor. We get too much of the writer's thoughts, his interaction with people, and his supposedly brilliant investigative work. Information that should be summarized in a paragraph become pages long. Cut the fat and stick to the story: why is Steven so dangerous, what crimes did he commit, how did he escape, where is he now?If you need to know more about Asian crime, I guess you should buy this. Otherwise, there are much better books."
1,BEWARE,"Documentation of this software is very poor on all levels, including the info on Amazon! If you do not know someone with the same Mac and OS who is already running this software successfully, DON'T BUY IT unless you can afford to blow the money! The speech recognition may or may not work for you. The transcription software IS NOT INCLUDED WITH THIS PURCHASE. You will need to invest more money for an extention if you want to use a digital recorder, DESPITE the fact that Amazon pairs them when you go to check out. Furthermore, even if you install the latest versions of software from Olympus, Macspeech, Audacity (shareware you may need...) the packages still may not work together with your Mac. If it works, it is slick, but it is a crap shoot. Buyer beware!"
4,Resource literature for Peruvian friends,"I wish I could review this book, but I haven't read it in English and can't read it in Spanish. I was just happy to find a book by this well-known and well thought of author to send to friends in Peru."
3,mixed review,"There are some good things and some bad things about this Thomas the Tank Engine story book. The illustrations are action-filled and colorful, the text is simple, and the book includes tiny flash cards for helping your beginning reader; however, the text is also confusing. In order to stick to 50 words the author has sacrificed clarity and readability. It's not always clear who is speaking, and rhymes are often strained and awkward. Also the lesson is not that slow and steady wins the race, as others have stated, but that Thomas is losing but then finds a shortcut through a tunnel. All-in-all, not the best of this educational and entertaining series."
1,Donald Trump authors childrens book,"Great pictures, but did Donald Trump write the story line? The books ends with a smug Thomas exclaiming ""I am first and you are last!"""
2,Great through warranty period but.....,"On the plus side, it is the most comfortable watch I've ever owned due to the nylon and velcro strap. The luminous lines showed brightly at night and were easy to read.Got this as a gift for Christmas. 4 months after warranty expired, moisture showed up inside the case. Emails to campco just went around and around. All I did was wash my hands. I had never changed the battery because it didn't need it and the screw on the side was screwed down as tightly as possible. Poor customer service by Campco. Avoid this watch and spend the extra money for a better manufacturer with better customer service that stands by their product like Traser or possibly Luminox. You get what you pay for."
4,Has its purpose,"This is a useful book for those who don't view themselves as creative individuals. It's not that there's anything revolutionary in here, more that the book points out how much effort and editing are key factors in creativity. ""Whack"" will not necessarily change your world, but it will offer some ideas and exercises that help broaden your perspective. If nothing else, the greatness of this book is in its ability to re-state what you already ought to know."
4,"If not a whack, at least a little thump","I found this book to be very entertaining and it certainly gave me some fresh and creative ways to look at situations/problems. I'm not sure yet how I will be able to put any of them to use, but that may be because I'm a bit overwhelmed after just reading the book. The exercises within the chapters did not always offer me the insight on how to use the topics they were supposed to be practicing. I am hopeful that the next time I run into a brick wall, some of the suggestions occur to me and that I can put them into practice.I can see how this would make a very effective seminar or training, with groups working on the exercises, bouncing ideas off one another and spurring one another on to more creative thinking."
3,Shackles,I love this song. We used to skate to SHACKLES in the 80's. I went to a birthday party for my niece and they played it at the skating rink. Great memories. I think my cousin and I had more fun skating to it than the kids did.
1,never got it!!!!!,was sent the wrong cd twice! searched long and hard for this title- was excited to see that amazon had it--- apparently-- NOT! so disappointed.
3,Good Stuff,"I use this media in an ebb and flow system with sweet peas in a greenhouse. It works great. Just be sure to thoroughly wash the media BEFORE putting it in your system. In mine, it raised the EC by .7 just running water over it. It took months before my nutrient tank/EC readings were dependable. If there are instructions, they probably warn you to wash the media first, but I jumped in and did not do this. Big mistake.I wish they would prewash it so it could be used out of the bag."
4,Completely True Title,"Allen tells you straight up what you need to do to get ahead and promote yourself. The key word here is shameless. It's very good, but if you've got any shame, even the slightest shred of decency, you'll be taken aback by some of what she says works. Morally, I'm not sure if a fair portion of it is defensible. Promotion isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's got to be handled with taste. For that, I found Guerrilla PR: Wired by Levine to be much easier to deal with.I'm not saying Allen's ideas don't work--plenty of examples prove they do, in fact, work. But, just because you can do something doesn't mean you should."
2,In-complete Thai Dictionary,"Lots of everyday words where missing. Frustrating when you are looking at a dictionary, one just expects it to be there. 50% of the time the word I was looking for wasn't in the dictionary. Granted that some words may not translate, not that many though surely.Not the worst Thai dictionary but lots of room for improvement."
4,"exellent, complete textbook","i liked the book very much. i am a naturopath, and my studies have been based on the previous edition of the textbook. i use it still, years after i finished my studies. it's the only textbook for naturopathy, and it's getting better with every edition. and now it comes with the e-edition and updates....!!i also love the integrative tendency of the text, and it's helpful to me in my work in a hospital.still, of course, there are subjects that i'm missing in it, like the power of special foods, for example, or complete metabolism pathways. these things have to be completed from other books - which is also ok.so, overall, i'm very pleased with the book, and continue to use it for my students now.kira levy - naturopath"
1,THE WORST MANUFACTURER TO DEAL WITH!,"True enough, if you buy this from Walmart.com, it is cheaper. But regardless of where you buy it from, pray that your parts all come intact and you never have to deal with their customer service. One part arrived broken, I then called cust. service to replace it (in which it took 2 months to arrive). When it finally, it was the wrong part!! I even confirmed the part twice with them before getting off the phone and they noted it on the shipping papers that came w/ the part. I ordered this on 12/30/05 and it is now 03/27/06 and I still don't have all the parts to assemble my daughter's chest of drawers!!!"
4,"Sturdy Dresser, macthes BSF charry cribs perfectly","This dresser is perfect for my twins room. The only thing that is odd is on the third drawer there is a wood bar, making the dreser not as tall...but I made this my kiddos sock drawer. Also this dreser matches the BSF cribs, cherry, 100%"
1,Total junk,"I received the package and went to work assembling. The instructions consisted of low grade drawings with no wording. After three hours of construction I discovered that the unit totally did not fit together correctly. The drawers did not fit on the tracks, I didn't have room for a drawer and there was a large gap at the bottom.I am totally dissatisfied; I want this cheap piece of garbage out of my house. The bottom of the drawers and the back are very thin particle board. This is incredibly low grade what I would expect to get from Wal-Mart for $40 not JC Penny's for $200.Save your time and frustration!"
2,Assembling the was not fun,This product is good after being assembled..you have to put too many pieces together I mean it comes completely unassambled I bought crib and assambled way faster than this chest drawer.After assembling the product it had alot of which made me happy at the end but I wish I was told before I got it that it was hard and time consuming putting it together.
4,Beautiful piece of furniture,"I am 8 months pregnant, and I put this together myself. It is really a beautiful dresser. It took some work, but I did it, and everything fit perfectly. If you are looking for an affordable but nice piece of furniture, and you don't mind putting some work into it, I would get this. The drawers are pretty shallow, but that is why I bought the 5 drawer chest instead of the 3. I still have plenty of room for my baby girl's clothes when she gets here."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!,"This item is packaged horribly. If you are lucky enough to get intact a great product for a great price. Received changing hutch and tower, crib and toybox intact. Very happy. Ordered this dresser twice, both times damaged. Good luck trying to put back in crummy box to return and good luck trying to get damaged parts replaced unless you can wait 6-8 plus weeks. My suggestion is to order two dressers, take the best pieces from each, and return the rest. Believe me, you will be glad you did."
2,Stork Craft Beatrice 5 Drawer,"I purchased this item because i needed more space for my kids clothes. We put it together with in 2 1/2 hrs. was ready to put the drawers in the slot when the drawers didn't go all the way. The reason i wanted this dresser is because i have one similar and is very sturdy and it came with all the correct pieces. This item on the other hand had a few problems, the metal rails for the bottom of the drawer are not long enough for the drawer like they are supposed to be. also the screws on the inside were not put in straight so we have to jimmy the 2 bottom drawers into place because of the screws everytime we open and close the drawers. its stated that i cant return this item because i am past the full refund return date which also happens to be the date I received this item. I need replacement parts and a special screw for the inside of the drawers. this was 1 bad experience out of quite a few. I hope this issue can be fixed."
1,Would NEVER buy again!,I would not ever buy this product again. We purchased this piece of furniture in February and it is July and the dresser has completely fallen apart. I imagine that the people who like this product have only put baby clothes on it. I have this dresser for my baby and 3 year old to share and it doesn't do well with toddler clothes. It is not kid friendly! You will disappointed if you buy this product when you begin to use it for anything other than infant clothes. This product is not made to last long.
2,Came with wrong pieces,"This item came with wrong pieces. Assembly was much more difficult than other dressers we own. The screws had no screw holes and 1/5 drawers did not even belong to the set. My husband had to crack the screws in which will most likely lead to future cracks. Also, not enough screws were sent! I am disappointed with this product. It is not worth the price. Wish I would've purchased at Target or somewhere nearby to remedy this issue. Pass on this dresser!"
4,"Great info, so-so recipes","In many CSA circles, this is considered the Bible. And while it is definitely my go-to resource when unsure of storage, usage, etc., and I believe that everyone who is in a CSA should own it, I agree with another poster about the lackluster recipes. I have found a few winners in the bunch, but many are a bit involved for everyday cooking. Then again, maybe they figure people dont' need a recipe for a quick stir fry or egg scramble. A new version with updated recipes would be awesome!"
2,dog training,"the product arrived in a timely manner but i felt the tape was not a helpful as i had hoped, brian used dogs that already knew the commands so in that respect it was not helpful. i would not recommend this tape to anyone looking for a training tape."
1,worthless warranty,"Most of the time this can opener fails to pierce the can lid. When I attempted to get it repaired or replaced I discovered they want $7.50 to cover ""shipping and handling"". The product carries the Black and Decker name but is made by a company called Applica."
4,Using them for lap swimming....,"These are pretty good for lap swimming. I am admittedly not very fast, but I didn't need any Swimmers Ear drops or the like after my work out today.I like the cord on it because I think it would be awkward to try to chase down one that happened to fall out. There was no danger of these falling out, though, when they were inserted and there was no pain or pressure. It was an added bonus that it made things even quieter and more serene.I recommend these!Update 10/31/10: I think I have used these approximately 10 times and the cord pulled out of the plug on one side today. They are still keeping water out, though."
5,What a shame........,"I was listing to the music channel in the cable line up and they played 'Taste Your Love' and it sounded cool, I went to the computer and sampled the cd and I couldn't believe how tight this cd was. I know it's old but it's still off the chain. This cd has so many good songs on it so I downloaded it. This cat has skills and he uses them to lay down up beat tracks like 'One for the Money' to mellow tracks like 'How can we Stop'. I wish he was still making music (like he did on this cd, not try to cross over) all they ever played on the radio was 'One for the Money' you never heard anything else unless you bought the cd, all I can say is what a shame, he didn't get more air play back in the day."
1,not compatible,"Running Win XP home additionI purchased the Avermedia AVERTV USB at Fry's electronics.On the box "" Compatible with win 95, 98, 2000, XP ""Inside the box there is a notice "" DO NOT LOAD THIS SOFTWARE IF YOU ARE RUNNING WIN XP. GO TO OUR WEB SITE AND DOWNLOAD THE CURRENT DRIVERS FOR XP BEFORE INSTALLING SOFTWARE ""GUESS WHAT? there are no drivers for XP at AverMedia web site."
4,"Not quite ""Innumeracy"", but still good","If you haven't read John Allen Paulos' Innumeracy, go read it before you buy this book because it's much better. If you have read Innumeracy, this serves as a pretty similar book, pointing out the role of probability, etc. in everyday life, dispelling fallacies, etc. I especially enjoyed chapters on Lanchester's Law (how math plays a role in war) and the Stock Market. The author gets a little tangential on the politics chapters, but overall, it's still a good easy read."
3,Doesn't Smell The Way I Thought It Would,"There is no way that I have a recollection of clean clothes when I put this on. Why no one can come up with a smell of a fresh clean shirt. This just has a sweet smell and that's it. Clean has one that smells like a mans' T shirt, but that's not the smell I want.And the search goes on!!!!!"
4,incredable,"inspection 12 is one of the rare bands that has something to offer to punk that hasn't been smashed into the ground. something fresh and new. with incredable harmonies, melodies, and guitar work, what more can you ask for in an album. flat out this album rocks."
3,Unwrapping the DVD set,"I am still digging into the new boxed set, but I wanted to echo several comments about the packaging. It is indeed awkward, fragile, and ill-concieved. A piece of printed paper hold together two large heavy sides. I have pampered the case like a newborn baby and it's already about to tear. Normal wear and tear will have people buying new cases in the first month.Beyond that....I can't wait to see all 56 hours.-jc"
3,The way it is,"a lot of people are concerned about the editing of this boxset. i have not seen the master copies but i can assure you that the wwf blur and wwf vocal and visual reference WILL still be edited and blurred just like the wrestlemania anthology. As of last week on wwe programming they where still editing out wwf references on this week in wwe history segment.the music will still be edited as no advancements have been made in the Demolition, dusty roads,Slick,etc copyright etc !the uk tagged classics versions however are unedited completely from the original release"
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,Not worth the money unless you enjoy watching boring Royal Rumbles from the past with WWF bleeped out. Also be careful if you plan on opening the box more than a few times its liable to rip apart at the middle seam (very cheaply made) Basically no more than a pile of junk.
1,Foreshadowing,"It's funny how, when commenting on public perception of ""Rattle and Hum,"" the members of U2 were worried about coming off as self-centered and pretentious. It seems to me, after watching this latest documentary, that the only thing that has changed since then is that they no longer care about that perception. Bono continues his pursuit of the legacy of Bono, and the Edge -- mirroring his narcissistic turn (and poor showing in comparison to the other featured artists) in ""It Might Get Loud"" -- continues to marvel at his own limited abilities.This video is for rabid fans of U2 only. The rest of us will pick up on the film's premise of ""what would have happened if the band broke up after Joshua Tree"" and consider what we might have been spared. ""Pop,"" anyone?"
2,Leaked within 2 months,"The punching bag was great when we first got it. My kids loved it and so did my husband. Lots of fun to work off energy when we're stuck inside during the winter. Until it sprang a leak after a month and a half. I wouldn't be so upset if it was a cheap $10 bag but for $30, it should not leak after such minimal use. Would not buy again or recommend though I will be on the lookout for another punching bag of better quality."
3,not durable,"I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old son because he watched Reel Steel on DVD and decided he was a boxing robot. We got tired of being the sparing partner. He played with it for about 2 weeks and the bottom where the water goes to keep it upright started to leak. My advice is it is an ""okay deal"" but make sure you have a patch. You get what you pay for."
1,missing parts,"The item was missing the ""cap"" that goes over the plug to keep the water in the base. Can't use the product because without the water in the bottom it wont stay still. Not sure how to contact the seller, but I would like to get this cap so that we can use the punching bag."
4,A laid back rap cd,"This is a very good laid back rap cd, maybe a litle too much softnes in some of the tracks. But the cd is great, a great buy I recomand it."
4,"Liked it, good reference for paddling",I liked this book and used it for some paddling & camping in NH. It gave nice descriptions of the water conditions and paddling descriptions. I agree that it's not a 'how to' book on camping. It's a reference for people who know camping already and are looking for rivers to paddle & camp along.
5,Works great for me,I got this remote from this seller pretty fast. I programmed it in less than two minutes. My tv is a durabrand tv (which is a wal mart brand) and it works great. It saved my lazy ass from walking up to the tv and changing channels that way.
3,Definitely Adequate,"Fairly objective; not an apologia as some may have presumed. I would have prefered to see a good timeline or method to track his activities in detail. Even though chronological, the pure text format makes it difficult to follow. On the other hand, this work provides fairly good insight into Hampton's thinking and views. Better than average coverage of a complicated person and history."
2,typical italo-over produced disco,"Normally I love to give good reviews to disco albums, butfor this one, it was your typical studio collaboration ofthe Philadelphia musicians and the Giuliano Salerniroutine productions. Just the usual disco drumming andvocals that sound foreign and the overproduction of stringsand over dubbing.They should have released it as a second album to Ultimate.then again the Saturday Night Band and the ConstellationOrchestra are the same group, who were they trying to kid."
2,The spectacular Cher,This DVD is just an edited version of 'Cher live in concert' & 'the farewell concert'I only recomend this DVD if you have neither of the other full concerts
1,[Bad] software,"I run Windows 98 on a reasonable system. This program installs ok, but it will not reliably run. It most often gives some vague error message and aborts. The few times I have made it run, it translates J-E or E-J into some kind of jibberish.I have a small understanding of Japanese, but need a program that would speed up my work. This program is most definately not a good choice!!!"
2,LDS Quad,There was no description on the LDS Quad. I expected a regular print. I received a compact print.I purchased it through Amazon.com and do not know how to return it or get a refund. I paid by Credit Card in my Amazon.com shopping cart.
4,Love this story,This is such a fun story to read! I read it to my elementary classroom many many times! It was always fun to see who would spot the next item first! It's funny and silly and a great book!
1,You may not want this if . . . .,"Personally, I found the music a bit slow and subdued. Not what one typically thinks of country dance music being like. However, the reason I rate it so low is because of the deception on the part of the producer/manufacturer/packager/whatever of this cd. This CD is actually the same - track for track, down to the timings - as ""English Country Dances from Playford's Dancing Master"". But this CD is deceptively attributed to the individual members of the band instead of naming the group, The Broadside Band. It is cheaper than the original cd, though. The short and sweet - if you have the Broadside Band cd, you don't want this one."
5,IF you want the best this is it,"Works as advertised, up and running in less than 30 min in two rooms. Love the internet radio feture and am still playing with the Rhapsody free trial. Sound quality is good and should satisfy all but the pickiest users. Fit and finish is first rate. Absolutly no dropped signal so far. I love it and do not regret paying a bit more for this sytem."
1,B-Class,"Is the only way to describe this movie, and not in the good way. Basically, no-name actor husband loses his no-name actress wife in an electical storm. He is blamed for the murder by the no-name detective. He finds a no-name female scientist and teams up with her to find his wife. And no name actors are alright if they are good. This cast is far from it. The lame ending, the lame story, the lame acting, the lame comedy, the lame emotion, and the lame drama (so basically everything)prevent this movie from being good; or average; or tolerable; or bad; or horrible."
1,Worst DVD ever,"This is the worst DVD I've ever seen. The picture quality is terrible, the aspect ratio is wrong and cannot be corrected. It's a shame to have it on Amazon sale."
2,Outdated living on a shoestring,"As you may have been reading in the other reviews, this book is very different. Most of the suggestions are wacky, and really could only save you pennies to say the least. Once in awhile, the suggestions are okay, if you own a home (which I don't because I don't have money) but if you followed every suggestion in the book you would be the laughing stock of your community. There are much better books on the market for the purpose this book is supposed to serve. If only they would update it, it wouldn't be half bad. I mean, they talk about going to the library to use internet when almost everyone has internet on their phones nowadays and other wierd ""hints"" that just don't make sense. They spend a whole section on just organizing your bills and putting them in places like a shoe organizer or an empty cereal box because this will help you save money.Real frugal people would just save their money and skip the book to read something that will actually help you."
5,"Great photographs, great set-ups, packed with information",I'm a semi-pro photographer and i loved this book. I keep in near me for almost every shoot. The lighting diagrams can be used for so many different types of photography.Awesome photos from Eric Bean got my creative juices flowing. He makes shooting amazing fashion photos look easy. Loved this book!!
3,Seems to hold up so far...,"The screws that go into the wooden joist is a bit short and I was uneasy using them to hang any thing. So I replaced them with longer screws. The nut that attaches to the swivel will DEFINITELY become loose with use. Everlast should have supplied 2 nuts for that swivel screw. I had to find extra nut to secure the swivel from becoming loose with use.Other than that, I have to put in more hours before making additional impressions.I hang a 80lb heavy bag."
1,Didn't need it!,"I brought my husband the 100 lb Canvas Everlast Punching Bag and it was suggested that I also purchase this product for hanging the bag. My husband didn't need this accessory set at all. He went to Home Depot and purchased a heavy weight bolt and screwed it in a beam from the garage ceiling, which worked perfectly."
4,Aluminum studs suck,"The product seems fine, it's just when I went to install it I realized I had aluminum studs so I had to go with a different Everlast product to hang my bag."
1,Bolt snapped,"Worked like a charm for 5 minutes, then one of the lag bolts that go into the beam snapped. Guess I'll just go to the hardware store and buy an eye hook."
5,Spacenut Library must have¡¡,"A wonderful little book, I wished was available for a spacenut like me so many years ago, its jampacked with good content and images from the basics of rocket history, evolution worldwide,principles of operation and a view of the future in the 21th century, all explained in easy to understand language."
2,"Product OK, manufacture not so good","Be aware when you purchase this, getting someone from isound to help you, should a problem arise is impossible. We were missing the base piece for the Zune and are unable to reach them by phone, no answer-voicemail full and no one will respond to e-mails."
2,Bracelet,"Excelent piece of Navajo Art, but so thin material? Seems more a fine gillette than a bracelet. I gave to my wife and that was she said."
5,Above All,I was completely satisfied with the product and the service. I highly recommend buyinsurplus new or good used products in this economy it really helps when you can find a bargain
5,"A New Structure for Myth, Culture and Living Life","Joe Campbell taught us the ""journey"" underlies most myths. Chris Hoffman is teaching us that not only stories but whole cultures are spun on one of two images. Students in my seminars say ""It's a unified field! We can hang everything on this structure."" They also find hope for themselves and the future in the book, with comments like ""It's not about duality. We're not forced to make a choice between, for example, hierarchy and community, or ambition and friendship, or a life of action or one of contemplation. It's both Hoop and Tree."" The payback for reading this book - an easy read compared to Campbell - is a simple structure for organizing immense amounts of information, and for living your life."
2,Dynasty Double Diner Raised Feeding Station,The feeding station cannot be used for storage of food because when you open the drawer the whole thing falls forward spilling water all over the place including into the dog food. Would have been nice to know this before I purchased.
5,Great instructional piece.,I use this PBS video for my music class room to teach about american music. then we travel along the Mississippi all the way from MN to New Orleans.
3,"Reasonable for the price, good beginner set","None of the bits I have used so far had nicks in the blades.Can't see any on the other bits yet either (trust me, I checked them when I got the set based on the reviews).I'm not sure they're going to last too long either based on what I'm seeing from limited use, but for a relative beginner like me these offer a good starting point set. Presumably I'll find myself using specific bits more over time and expect to invest in better quality ones as I identify them.The case is useful for keeping them all together or transporting for a 'home' user, but definitely won't stand up to much/any abuse in a commercial environment."
2,"review of Professional-Grade 80-Piece Premium-Grade 1/2"" Router Set","Router bits are good, but a very bad design on the case. Foam holds them in place and the foam tends to slide around and tool bits knock together."
4,READ IT - YOU WILL LOVE IT!,"This story is taken from Silhouette's ""Bundles of Joy"" series.Don't pass it up. [from the back of the book] ****** THE TYCOON AND THE ADORABLE TYKE ------ Rich, handsom and famous, Nicolas Frakes was the world's sexiest bachelor. But when Bethany Dale firs clapped eyes on him, he was spoon-feeding spinach to his orphaned niece, tenderly cradling the infant to his bare, brawny chest.........Bethany promptly lost her heart.... and then her head. And soon she was playing live-in nanny with Nicholas and tiny Maree -- falling hard for the tot and her tycoon dad. The feeling was definitely mutual. Trouble was, Bethany couldn't give Nicholas the babies her arms ached to hold. The babies he would surely want from any woman who was to be his wife...... *********It all seems to start with a doll-house and leads to .....You will love the tension building with Bethany and how she and Nick resolve their differences --- great reading -- you may want to keep this one."
2,Silly computer crap,"It's ok to watch, but unless you got something better to do, don't. The really only redeaming things are the wife and son's preformances are good, but the other characters are grating. The story is long and kinda dull. And this coputer who doesn't uderstand alot of human words, has emotions? Lots of plot loop holes and bad acting."
5,Wonderful,"I waned to find out what happen to the characters of The Angel Doll and was not dissapointed. A truly loving story that touch my heart and will touch those who will read it after reading The Angel Doll. Very, very, very good."
3,"""Billy the Kid"" 20","Hilarious to see the different takes on ""Billy the Kid"" character. HAY, it's just old B/W westerns put straight onto disk - don't expect modern color epics. Kinda fun for old guys like me that used to pay to see similar films when young. I keep mine in the DVD player and watch one or two if I can't find anything else worth watching on TV - that's more often than not with the raft of junk on cable these days. So, it was the material I expected, and it arrived on time and as advertised."
1,Billy the kid,This is the worlds most awfullest westerm movie version of Billy the Kid. I could have made a far better movie seies with my cam corder. Billy the Kid. starring Buster Crap was some awful junk! I would love to return this garbage of movies.
1,No USB Port,"I purchased this product for $14.68 about a week ago... the price is now $24.99. I thought it would be nice to charge my iPod and I could use the regular input for a phone charger etc.At the time of purchase the description said ""USB power port for charging phones and other electronics"". Well, that's not the case. There IS a location where you could potentially charge through USB but that port has been blocked off. There is irremovable plastic over top of the port. It's almost like this is a lower end version of the real thing and you have to pay a little extra for the additional USB slot accessory.I just finished boxing it up and it's headed to the UPS Store tomorrow. I will not be keeping the product. Sorry, but I never tested it out to see if the normal jack worked. I was too angered by the fact that it had no USB."
5,Loving it in LA,"Iffy has got one of the most infectious grooves I've heard in ages. You can't listen to them and stay in a bad mood, let alone sit still. If this CD is not in your collection then you are really missing out on something special."
2,PLEASE..read her other work first!,"It is as though Batya Gur were trying to finish this book. It was a book in need of editing, but that would have left only a third of the pages. Too much angst, as others have pointed out here in the reviews. Very nasty murders, these, and not nearly as sparkling and atmospheric a solution. Very little Israeli backgound here, an aspect of Batya Gur's previous Ohayon novels that has been wonderful, and lackluster plot development. A midlife crisis of a book. PLEASE read this talented woman's previous Ohayon novels."
1,Total disappointment in this author.,The last time I was this disappointed in a book was when I read Patricia Cornwell's Hornet's Nest. I always loved this series and the detective. Ms. Gur has forever ruined this character for me.
4,Makes a great key chain,As a business owner and coach I have more keys than the mayor and I'm constantly taking some off and putting others on. Instead of destroying my fingers and keyrings alike I got a giant clip. I can keep it on my belt or belt loop and it keeps things easy!!!
2,This book SCREAMED for a good editor,"After he set out the initial scene and made narrative inroads, the author proceeded to regale us with his views on time and why they're important. These pseudo-science views could have all made a great short story but had no place interspersing with an actual narrative. It really screamed for a good editor to sit the poor man down and say ""No."""
2,A Disappointment,"The title of this book drew my interest. Unfortunately, the book never delivered on what I thought was a very interesting subject.During an age when the different parts of the world followed their own clocks, it made me realized how confusing and disconnected the world was. I was fascinated to learn how the railroads became the time keepers, but disappointed as the Author seemed to spend more time discussing the impact of the railroad rather than delivering more on Fleming and/or standard time.I had hoped to get a good understanding of Sandford Fleming, his contempararies, and the Prime Meridian Conference. There were parts of this book that where an effort to get through. All in all, I found this book not delivering on the subject. Books that I thought did a better job on regarding historical events were:Longitude - Dava SobelKing Leopold's Ghost - A. Hochschild"
1,Disappointed,"I bought this book because I was fascinated by the story of how standardized time came about. While this book didn't diminish this fascination, I can't say is sated my appetite either. The book is at its best when discussing Sir Sanford Fleming and his life and how it related to standardized time. It is most lacking in the discussion of how writers' and artists' concept of time had been changing. That is not why I picked up this book. When Blaise discusses how the concept of time changed in the art world and how it was a reflection of every day life, the book reads like a bad term paper.I would suggest passing on this title to find something more suitable."
2,Not Informative Enough,"As the sub-title carefully indicates, this is neither a full biography of Fleming nor a thorough history of the adoption of standard time. Rather, the best portions describe Fleming's association with the standardization of time in the 1870s and 1880s, especially the global extension of that concept. Unfortunately, not half of the book deals with this subject. The balance is shameless padding including, among many other topics, reminiscences of the author's life and the author's views on Sherlock Holmes, Dreiser's 'Sister Carrie', and 19th and 20th century literature."
1,A Chronological Mess,"Oddly, this book is not told in chronological order. The author gives the plot away early and just blabbers on and on. This book will leave you confused over how many plans Flemming had and how, why, when he changed them. The author skips over interesting concepts he should have elaborate on (Time-balls) and blathers on about boring, unrelated time concepts.I think the best histories are told as stories. The book told me enough to know just how our ""The Professor and the Madman"" author would have handled the tale. He would have started with the missed train episode and then gone back in time and told it straight through---more or less.The author discussed issues before his main character was more than just cardboard. Then again, he remained cardboard throughout the book. Why did I ever finish it?"
3,"Solid, yet unexceptional AOR album","It's pretty rare for me to be less than impressed with an album on the Frontiers label, but Stan Bush's 2001 release Language of the Heart just doesn't do that much for me. I know Bush has quite a few solo albums under his belt, but I am more familiar with his contributions on the Transformers movie soundtrack.Language of the Heart is a solid AOR album with well-written songs, and Bush's performance is quite good (wow, there's 5 words I never thought I'd type). The album just doesn't seem to reach out and grab me. It's hard to describe what I mean. Some bands have the ability to captivate the listener right from the start (Fair Warning, Pink Cream 69, even Jimi Jamison's solo album), but that is missing on this album. There isn't a ""the Touch"" moment on Language of the Heart.Still, it's a good CD, and worth owning if you're a (Stan) Bush fan. It's just not as exciting as I hoped it would be."
1,bamaeagle,This music was not what I anticipated and did not include the songs I had expected. Would not recommend.
1,my two cents,"As a fan of the ORIGINAL company B, nothing can replace the original sound and members of the original group. Thanks for the great dance classics!!!!haven't listened to this cd and don't want to, I want the original CD, which unfortunately is out of print"
4,"Only a slightly different ""view""......","I was only four years old when my parents took us to see Lili. I had mostly memories of the puppets and how they danced and came ""alive"" to Lili. The song, Hi Lili Hi Lili Hi Lo, I must've sung for years after. Well, times change, and so, I guess, have I. Seeing Lili 45 years later, I was disappointed only once obviously having forgotten Mel Ferrer smacking Lili ""up long side the head"" (only ""once"", that's enough for me, thanks) I certainly don't see the movie in the same light now..., but I regressed to four again and enjoyed it for what it really is. A story with music and puppets and a carnival, the immediate maturing of an young, naive female in the early fifties, in France. Still, to my enjoyment, a great view. Thanks."
5,An enjoyable read,"Mission to Moulokin is the sequel to Icerigger. It is about the further adventures of Ethan Frome Fortune, Skua September and Milliken Williams as they try to help their Tran friends qualify for admitance into the Commonwealth. It is a thoroughly enjoyable book as the heros battle against corrupt Commonwealth officials and an insane Tran leader, find the fabled city of Moulokin and learn of the history of the Tran."
3,too much highlighter,"The book was ok, it only had way too much highlighter in it, more than I expected and it confuses me a bit when I study, but the rest was more than fine."
2,I THOUGHT IT SUCKED,"THERE HAVE BEEN BETTER NWO PAYPER VIEWS THAN THIS ONE.HOWEVER I WILL BUY IT FORMY COLLECTION AND ONLYFOR THE SMACKDOWN MATCHESON THE 2ND DISC.IF YA WANT TO BUY IT JUSTTO OWN ALL THE PAY PER VIEWS,THATS FINE.BUT IF YA HAVEN'TSEEN IT YET DON'T BOTHER."
3,Overly ambitious,"Stallion Gate attempts to ""document"" the development of the plutionium bomb from the viewpoint of a Native American army sergeant, Joe Pena.As well-written as Smith's Renko novels, Smith makes the error of trying to include too much in his character. Pena is considered by others -- but not himself -- as a war hero, a disaffected Native American, a security informer, a jazz pianist, and a boxer. He is involved in almost all major developments of the development of the atom bomb at Los Alamos.I found myself taken out of the novel at times by how Pena could be involved with so many aspects of life around Los Alamos.While well worth the read, Smith's ending moves from the realism of the majority of the novel to, what was for me, an unsatisfying metaphorical ending."
1,Beginner's Guide To Continue Poor Scholarship,"The title is erroneous.Israel is a part of Palestine and refuses to be in conflict with itself. As a matter of fact it made a durable peace with the Eastern Palestinian Kingdom behind the Biblical river of Jordan.The conflict is between the Arab-speaking people and the Israelized Jews who speak many tongues.The book contains a wrong map which shows Gaza seeing the withdrawal of Israeli troops in 1957 and 1982.It also shows Lebanon south of Beirut to be occupied by Israel for 3 years.It is so sloppy that it even does not mention in its chronology the creation of the Emirate of Transjordan carved by the British from Palestine.It also contains errors like""Moshe Dayan drives all Palestinian civilians from Lydda and Ramle by force""First, at that time Jews and Arabs alike were Palestinian civilians.Second, Arabs and Jews still live together in Lod and Ramle!"
5,Mad Fabricators Vol. 1,"This was the first of a new breed of video entertainment. For many it was an introduction to the Rat Rod and a lifestyle totally different to how hot rodders had portayed themselves in the past. Great content, great production, well worth the money."
4,Great live performances with some sonic limitations,"These are live recordings from 1944-1946, and while acceptable, the sound quality, worst in the 2nd symphony,is not up to modern standards. That said,the playing of the Boston Symphony is excellent for live performances, and Serge Koussevitzkynever allows the tension or the momentum to sag. The Brahms symphonies can be real snoozers in some hands, and there are some really mediocre recordings of them out there. In the 'vintage recording' category, these are right up there with Bruno Walterand Felix Weingartner as the best, IMHO."
2,Tantalizingly provocative: a cornucopia of speculation,"Sen. Rick Santorum would not endorse this review, but I am voting against this book since there surely cannot be enough material in L&C's journals for a full book on this subject. I recommend instead the book ""Disease and History"" (1972) by Frederick F. Cartwright, which explains how various diseases helped change or form history. Also I will point out that some have said there's people relating to this book ""suffering from delusions of grandeur fed by sycophants"". I don't know, I'm just repeating this slander here. BTW I have not read this book."
4,Works well with laptops!,"I bought this for a friend of mine, he has been using it for about a couple of months now. He says the product is really nice and works well with his Dell laptop. It does have grainy image in low light situation though. We had a mail-in rebate at the time when we bought it and we feel it is a good buy for that price."
1,Not for Vista - beware!,"This webcam just won't work with Vista. I have searched high and low for a driver for this, but none of them do the trick. And to think I just bought this! The Logitech I bought several years ago has Vista drivers and works great, and Creative doesn't even bother updating the drivers for such a recent product. Should've known not to trust the short sighted Singaporeans. Swiss rocks! Avoid this if you plan on running Vista."
4,Dont buy it if u are looking to use it for a time.,"It delivers the same quality as the creative notebook pro, which costs around $45 now. The only difference is that this ones more sturdy takes more abuse than that.As to whats inside it, I did a lot of inquiries into this one (after i bought it, sigh!) and i found out some tech stuff about the difference between this and the other under $50 webcams. This one uses a technology thats more advanced than the ccd used for others, but this technology is being used in webcam only of late and there are better products in line which will make this one a bit ancient.Currently i wouldnt advice anybody to use any webcam thats over $50 till the end of this year."
4,Good stuff,"I don't know a lot about web cams, but this camera has been reliable and also came with a free headset, which is pretty good for me."
5,best webcam!!,"I have a laptop that is so picky when it comes to webcams, I have tried many brands, many models. this one works so beautifuly that I am speechless. when I disconnect it from my laptop and reconnect it , computer recognize it and I do not have to wory about reinstalling the driver or program. it zooms and follow the face. so it is excellent. buy it , you will not regret it.I bought 2 of them."
1,"camera never did work, creative was no help","This is a NOTEBOOK camera, but it needs more power than most laptops have at the USB ports. Creative suggested I use a powered usb hub. Why would I want to use a Powered Hub with a laptop. I think the camera is a bad design. Returned it. I have never returned any of the products that I have purchased from AMAZON, but the return was painless."
2,Unhandy,"We looked all over for a phone that was a bit different and chose this one. We are disappointed. The dial is not in the same place as the phone this replicates, therefore making the numbers not in the same place as you expect them to be. If you don't have a light on, you can't see the numbers AT ALL. We wouldn't buy it again."
4,Good sound for what it is,"I was concerned that such an inexpensive product would deliver poor sound. In fact we used it to play Christmas music over a four room lower section of the house, and it did well. It's not a Bose, of course. It runs off of AA batteries or a plug. When you have it plugged in, it automatically stops using the batteries. It uses the earphone jack for audio output, so I think it shoud work with any MP3 player. It's a very high value for a low cost."
1,Power Finder 2.1,I can't say this program was a complete disappointment because I never got to see if it works. It wouldn't load. Neither would the second copy. And my retailer was tearful when I turned down his offer of a fourth copy to try. There's no manual and the vendor's web site has no software updates nor any links to technical help. I guess the vendor isn't interested in satisfying customers. No matter. With products like this the vendor won't be around long enough to worry about satifying customers. I'll find what I need from some other source.
4,...great uptempo radio friendly jazz...,"...you can electric slide to this at a club or play this at home when you have some contemporary companionship that you want to get 'compatable' with...i'm not a big smooth jazz fan, so wresslin four stars from me was a major accomplishment!!! jimmy sommers holds his own and his guests artists do the same...les nubes, norman brown, ginuwine, mr. tony-tone-toni himself: raphael saadiq, coolio (COOLIO!?!?! - yeah, but he jus barely mumblin thru a hook or two!), eric benet and sparkle...(i aint never been a big eric benet fan, but 'stay awhile' might actually get me to get up, get out and check his stuff out now)overall...this aint a bad disc...most of it qualifies more as r&b; played with jazzy instruments...but you can definitely sit back and enjoy this one..."
5,Expensive Lessons,"I heard Beth on the KDGE morning show and then saw her on Good Morning Texas. I was impressed by her poise and decided to buy her book. It was an attention grabbing book and I read it in a single day. It was bold of her to share her life lessons,painfully arrived at, for our edification. She has a unique talent for taking relationship issues and laying them bare. She offers practical advice on building a good relationship while helping us to avoid the pitfalls and traps of relationship mistakes. Hopefully we can avoid her painful, expensive lessons by heeding her advice. Her offering uses clear, real language while avoiding the common diatribe of self-help books. I'm a mariage counselor and would highly recommend it."
4,Kindred Spirit,"After reading the book I realized that I was not alone. I think there are many others out there from the '70's who were in the same boat and did not have anyone to talk to about the abuse they were suffering at home. Like the author, we went to school to escape home life. I think it is a great book and that everyone should read this true to life story of survival. It lets you know there is still a chance for all of us to land on our feet."
2,dies after 4 months,"great when i first bought it, but it died in about 4 months. stopped recieving keystrokes, even with brand new batteries.money down the drain."
4,Good poems by an excellent poet,"Not a bad poem in the batch, but none are true sparklers. This collection will not blow you away. I would describe this as nice work from a excellent writer, but few of these will likely go in a ""best of"" collection. If you only buy one Stern book, it should not be this one, but if you enjoy his work there is no reason not to enjoy this one."
1,Poor Quality,I bought this because it was a movie I had fond memories of growing up. The quality of the product is very poor however. It seems to be made from an old copy of the film and has lines and glitches. I expect to see holes like the projector had burned the film at any moment.
1,An awful treatment of a great story,"I bought the DVD version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version she saw aired in television. But the version put to DVD was a disaster.The lighting was poor to non-existent; the film quality was terrible. Reminding me of a VHS tape that had been copied one too many generations.Entire scenes were simply excised. In one instance Adele is being put to bed, and we immediately cut to another scene - coming in in mid-sentence - where it's the next night. This happens often throughout the film.Characters such as Grace Poole and Mason are never even properly introduced, leaving one to wonder if they'd dozed off for a few minutes during the movie.The DVD we saw was produced by Platinum Disc Corp and they ought to be ashamed! Even at $6.32 it was a gyp.Be careful which version of this movie you buy! We're sending this one back."
4,Very informative,"Although the production of this video is very poor, I enjoyed the information and the camaraderie of these women. It was fun to see old footage of the riot grrrl scene."
1,not for me,"I really like to cook and got this thinking it might have some shortcut meals for busier days. But they were just too lightweight and too many packaged ingredients for me. If you have to cook against your will, then go for it."
3,Interesting,"The first story, ""Loveday's Little Outing,"" is possibly the best story Waugh has ever written. The rest is interesting at best, but none of it reaches the level of biting wit that he usually exhibits. Unlike PG Wodehouse's short stories, which are only about half as good as his full-length novels, Waugh's short stories are actually quite enjoyable and sharp. Somehow acquire ""Loveday's Little Outing"" and leave the rest be."
5,Lewis Family Fans,"Our family has enjoyed watching this video several times. I think the kids' favorite song is ""Which Came First, the Chicken or the Egg?"" We bought this at a Lewis family concert for $20.00 so you are getting a bargain when you buy from Amazon. I will say on the neg side that the music was added to the video and is not recorded live. That would be fine except that the timing is off a fraction of a second, but we still love it and recommend it highly."
4,Very thourough and informative.,This was an interesting read. The author gives great information about what to look for and what to avoid and how to best make your money work for you!
1,poorly designed,"This ironing board is poorly designed. The chord minder is permanently attached in a position that does NOT allow enough space for the tip of the iron, i.e. you have to turn the iron 180 degrees, with the tip facing towards you. Hence, it is only suitable for Left-handed people, you guys will find this very useful. Right-handed people, stay away!"
2,A bit much...,"These are recipes that I would never use on a day by day basis, the ingredients are not ones that I usually stock in my home so this book was of little help to me to get more use out of my mixer. I returned it!"
3,Not bad....not the best either.,"Fair book. If you really like to cook, this book is worthwhile. I have to admit, I go to the ""The Mixer Bible"" way more often!"
5,The Definitive Joplin,"Richard Zimmerman is one of the best interpreters of Scott Joplin. Zimmerman avoids the pitfalls many others have taken by playing Joplin's music too fast and/or too flashy. Zimmerman's tempos are moderate and his ornamentation/improvisaion is tasteful. By not trying to be a ""show off"", Zimmerman keeps to the original spirit of Joplin's music. Although the original recording itself may be close to 30 years old, it has transferred well to CD. I highly recommend this disc to anyone who is interested in Ragtime and American music."
3,Interesting Overview,"I found this text to be interesting, but it only provides a very shallow level of knowledge. It's not terribly deep reading, but it would be an easy introductory book to the study of fairytales. For anyone interested in a deeper look, check out Alan Dundes' Cinderella: A Casebook or Neil Philip's Cinderella Story. For a broader approach to fairytales, most books by Jack Zipes and Marina Warner are excellent."
5,RV Retirement,Book was delivered quickly and in great shape. I would do business again. Price was well below what I'd found other places on the web.Thanks againCK
3,Doona complied,"This is yet another attempt to re-release a set of stories with nothing new. If you have not read the Doona series then this is your chance to get the whole set of Decision, Crisis and Treaty Planet in one set. Otherwise don't bother."
1,THIS MOVIE DOESN'T HAVE TOM MIX IN IT!,"THIS MOVIE IS A RIN TIN TIN MOVIE AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TOM MIX, OTHER REVIEWS WERE CATGORIZED UNDER THIS MOVIE TITLE AND MADE ME THINK THAT TOM MIX WAS IN IT. IF YOU LIKE RIN TIN TIN THEN BY ALL MEANS BUY THIS MOVIE, BUT IF TOM MIX IS YOUR THING BUY MIRACLE RIDER......"
5,Best Dermatology Text,This book is the best Dermatology text you can find. It is simple and have every thing you need to know. I think each Dermatologist should have one.
1,Not even worth 1 Star....,"This is seriously one of the worst movies I have ever seen. What a disgrace. It is a shame something so horrible could be produced and actually obtain the title of being a ""movie"". This makes a train wreck look like a butterfly-filled day to Disneyland. I can't find one thing to praise. In all honesty, the film is poorly done porn with a mess of a plot that lacks any sense and yet contradicts itself scene by scene. I feel bad for any actor who was roped into this ""movie"" thinking it would be a legit oppurtunity. I share their embarrassment. This is little more than the attempts of an old man with a video camera finding excuse to film senseless nudity. I want my money back!!!"
3,review of House of Pleasures,"This movie reminded me of Louis Malle's Pretty Baby. They both take place at the end of an era when houses of prostitution were being closed. It was during World War I in New Orleans in Pretty Baby. It was around 1900 in House of Pleasures.As a film, I thought the film moved too slowly. I was often bored. I think the use of modern music at various parts of the movie was disconcerting.That being said, I liked the acting and I thought the often-nude actresses were lovely. I admired the young prostitute who figured things out and left before the crash. She looked good, too."
2,should have been sexy,"A film about a French brothel should be delicious, but this one was a horror movie. Certain excruciating images from the film have gotten stuck in my head. The advertising is somewhat misleading, because underlying the sexy outfits is complete negative judgement. Made me feel like I was covered in something slippery and sticky all the time. If that was the goal, then it worked well. Just depends on how you like your self-torture."
3,Good service and Video,"The video arrived promptly and in good condition. While the video provides a good overview of the top several places that an ordinary tourist would visit, it focused highly on these sites and did not give great insight on what the rest of the city and culture was really like. The presentation was also fairly old-fashioned and stilted but the coverage of the sites was very detailed and informative. So, it was a very good video for tourists, not so much for somebody that would be taking a job or retiring over there. Otherwise it was well shot and well written."
4,Very nostalgic for me.,It was nice to watch again and remember when it was one of my little girl's favorite shows and we would watch together.
1,is this April FOOLS?,"Ya gotta be kidding! Leaves? Ya, but not with that much suction..... BUT if there's much of ANYTHING else that gets picked up along w/ the leaves, it clogs up. HOW can sticks and other stuff NOT get picked up?? They will! Which makes this thing worthless! Certainly this is was meant to be a joke."
4,Good thinking,"Great book of thought-provoking ideas. If you need to reflect on where you are in life, and where you want to go next, this book provides some insightful questions - not answers."
5,Power and quiet in one fan.,I brought one of these 4 years ago and its been running almost 24/7 since then. I just purchased a second FM121 to replace a Antec fan that was beginning to fail. After 4 years it's good to see that Silverstone still has the same quality as before. I can't comment on the included fan controller because I never used them. I modified both of them to work from a 3 pin connector to use with a custom fan controller. My only wish is that the actual fan came in black and not just the controller.
4,Design by eras/styles,"This book is not my cup of tea, but it's great for someone who's looking for a design from a certain era. The book is broken down by the different eras or styles: Victorian Geometric, Art Nouveau, Victorian Floral, Edwardian, and 1920's. All the designs have a lot of horizontal and vertical lines in them. Also, it's all in black and white so you have to use your imagination to color it. The back of the front cover and back cover has examples in color."
3,No more or less than what I expected,"The books templates are good, but as others have stated, it would be nice to know it was B&W only."
4,great patterns,Looking for ideas to use with 'stained glass' paint. Nice patterns in here. Many are included. I wish they had more shown in color though. The only color pages are on the inside and outside of the covers.
4,I love this huge old book.,"Out of print, but available as a used book. I love this huge (1300 page) old book with its hand-drawn sketches, old black-and-white photographs, and colorful descriptions. Philosophical, poetic, historical, an antique and a classic. Geomorphology is largely a descriptive science -- concerned with naming, classifying, and ordering phenomena, and the processes underlying the phenomena. This book is the place to find the meaning of terms such as peneplain, mima mound, monadnock, and mogote."
1,Abou El Fadl's Authoritarianism,"Despite competently hitting the bull's eye in several locations, Dr. Abou El Fadl commits the same crime he is trying to expose and fight. Whenever it is in his interest, he fails to discharge the 5 obligations which he proposes for establishing persuasive authority, namely: honesty, self-restraint, comprehensiveness, diligence, and reasonableness. His mentioning, for example, of the inquisition of the createdness of the Quran is disingenuous. No one can claim that the createdness of the Quran implies its circumstantiality, and thus the right to supercede it. After reading the book, I wondered about the plight of the Muslims trapped between the authoritarianism of Abou El Fadl and the authoritarianism of the Wahabbis...."
5,Nothing is what it seems,"Like all of Thomas's books, this one presents the reader with a world where just beneath the surface of ordinary reality danger and betrayal lurk just waiting for the hapless figures he creates to step in whatever new qucksand he has perpared. This book is vintage Thomas with believable characters, great dialogue, memorable lines, a convoluted but engrossing plot - full of surprises and ultimate satisfactions.I just can't believe that most of his books are out of print. This stuff is great reading. There is nothing else like it."
2,VERY SLOW,This was the slowest of all the British shows I have ever watched.The lead actor in the series will put you to sleep.
2,"Good beginner book, but need more beginner conversation",This is a very good book for very basic beginnings...but i feel that very basic conversational Italian was left out a bit...this helps to get you going and remember things...i ended up not using it for conversing. There are other books that are more conversational.
3,Thought provoking intro to little-known qualities of water,"Although it occasionally veers into new-age speculation or pseudoscience, this book offers a rare look at truly alternative ideas about water and energy. The description of Schauberger's early work with flumes is enthralling, and the brief exposition of ""flow forms"" towards the end of the book is valuable. Search ""flow forms"" in any web search engine to see some of the sites around the world espousing a fascinating technology that unites water pollution control with esthetics."
5,I have been using it for 2 months and I think this product is wonderful!!,"I purchased the small container of LiftFusion from Sephora for $25.00 and have had it for over 2 months and I'm now looking to buy the large bottle. I think it's worth every dollar. This product has completely taken away my frown lines and the wrinkles from sun damage on the corners of my eyes. And it does last for the entire day. It has even worked with the crinkles on my nose.No it's not permanent, but neither is Botox, however you don't have to worry about the needles, expense or the time. I only wish Amazon had better pricing."
1,Did Not Work,This type of shampoo worked on my dog when he had a skin problem back in November 2006. At that time I bought the shampoo from my Vet for $32. When the same skin condition returned the end of April 2007. I searched the Internet for a better price for it. I was happy I was able to find it for a more reasonable price. Unfortunately it has not worked on my 12 year old Maltese and now I have to pay for a return visit to my Vet! To say the least I am not happy.
4,Jason & The Scorchers Best Bootleg you can get!!!,"While the recording quality of this cd varies from bad to acceptable, the charm of the performance is the real deal. But if you are already a fan of this highly underrated group, you know you really dont need hi fidelity to appreciate their power. Get it, enjoy it, and listin to it every once in a while. The recording came directly from what is rated as one of the greatest bootleg perfomances in history, and this recording (directly from the LP) includes scratches and clicks too!! Charming, and worth the price of admission."
5,Burt's Bees Peppermint Bodywash,"I bought the peppermint bodywash and the shea butter bodywash from Burt's Bees. Vitacost, which is the amazon dealer, delivered the items in record time at no charge as long as I bought $50 worth of product. The peppermint bodywash is fantastic and foams up. The shea butter is OK, however, it does not foam and it does not smell that great. The peppermint tingles; and I would buy it again."
2,Have to use a lot,I have to agree with a previous review. I end up using about three times as much as other body washes because it hardly suds. It's almost like washing with lotion. I will keep looking for a more natural body wash.
2,not for me,"I really wanted to like this body wash. it's natural and i LOVE the smell. but, it was irritating my skin. my back started to break out after using this product - i'm not sure if it's the peppermint or the rosemary however. hopefully once i get a new pouf & body wash my skin will clear up!"
4,Great Story!,Story of struggle and trails with a strong uplifting message. Filmed in Alaska. We really liked it!
1,Not the version of first choice,"For reference there is another recording of Halka also featuring Wieslaw Ochman as Jontek but with Stefania Woytowicz in the title role. Conducted in 1973 by Jerzy Semkow it was reissued in 1988 on Le Chant du Monde (LDC278 889/90) and includes notes, Polish libretto and translations."
5,It was a gift...,It was a gift... he liked it a lot... we had seen another friend with that same boombox except this one was white... :)Thanks.
3,"It's good, but needs more.","This book had good pictures and examples to help a person draw manga and it's characters, but buy a different book if you are a beginner. This book wasn't very helpful to me, but if you are a good artist already and hope to be reminded to how to draw a few things like the head and body of manga characters, then get this book.But, I don't really recommend this book because it needs much more pages and helpful pointers."
3,"Vivid descriptive, to say the least......","Entertaining storyline if one can get past Olsen's flowery descriptions (i.e.,""The unvarying buffet of drumming water through long hours of feeling out your way in a slate-colored oblivion of rainy darkness ate like a drug in to your plodding body and mind, and the chill of a pounding wind taloned into your soaked carcass till your flesh went almost gratefully numb"".) Well developed characters."
4,Good in general,"Well, this tube may be the longest one I can find to accommodate my 42'' poster. The tube is composed of two parts, which easily fall apart when extended to the fullest length. Even though it's pretty easy to re-lock into position, still it's not quite convenient."
1,This item doesn't exist!,"I've ordered this item from two of Amazon's vendors and both times the vendors ship a similar, but smaller item. They do this without asking me first. It would be better for them to simply revise the specifications or drop this item all together! Perhaps they'll get more later on and you'll be lucky enough to get the correct item. Good luck!"
3,flimsy but functional,"First the pros,It's light, the locking mechanism is functional, the strap is pretty comfortable, and it telescopes fairly easily. It easily holds more than one poster. It has a place to put your name and such on the top.The negativesThe locking mechanisms slides in and out of place. When I lock it to take it to a conference I wrap the lock in tape so that it won't slip out and the poster tube won't end up in two pieces. The plastic is very bendable. There's no way I would feel comfortable checking this tube without thinking that it would crack or get crushed. The plastic is very thin and flimsy. The inside of the tube is not smooth which may make it harder to pull out your poster. The plastic smells weird.Now I wish I had spent a little more money and gotten something that would last since this will inevitably fall apart but for now it will work."
4,Good for the price,"I was looking for a document tube to carry a 42"" inch poster. This tube was one of the few that I could find that was a)long enough and b) within my price range. I received this item quickly and was pleased to find that it was easy to adjust, lighweight, and wide enough to accomodate multiple posters. As a negative, the tube sometimes would come apart while carrying it - this was easily fixed by locking it into place again. Overall, this was a useful purchase for the money."
5,Excellent!,"I bought this for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas because she loves stamping! That has been over a year now, and she still uses the set!! It is great quality and perfect for young and old stampers!!!"
2,Breakdown on 2nd use!!!! No response from seller.,"I happen to love this Waring Pro deep fryer (used my aunt's and loved it), but for some reason mine didn't work. I tried contacting seller and left a message but received no response. This item was received after Christmas, used once and it worked except the green light never went off. Second attempt at use was futile as it never worked at all. We pushed both reset buttons on deep fryer and still nothing (kind of like the seller). My boys love chicken nuggets, green tomatoes, zucchini etc. so we knew we would love this as our family gift for Christmas. Such a disappointment when we couldn't get it to operate for the 2nd use. Would have liked to know seller was bogus. PetFlom"
1,Worst Fryer EVER!!,"I got this fryer as a replacement for my 20-year old T-fal Fryer, what a mistake!! First of all the heating element is exposed and is submerged in the oil, making frying without the basket impossible, add to that the fact that it took 3 quarts of vegetable oil to fill to the ""minimum"" line, and the frying cappacity was whatever you could fry in a space about 4x6 inches (the approximate dimensions of the frying basket) and about 1 inch deep. My first (and last) use of this fryer was to make some egg rolls and I was limited to cooking no more than 3 at a time (and they were fairly small rolls), and the oil barely covered them. Also, the lid latch is flimsy so in order to open the lid while I was frying I had to pry it open while pushing the release button. What a disappointment!!"
3,Great Title; I'm 49 with no children...,"I lost a lot without college educated parents. Just graduating from college with a BA degree is harder work too. And then finding that career to raise a family as well? Put your shoes in my place for those who had more privilage. I see dads taking their kids to games, the park, the zoo, vacation, etc. I got none of that! You know who taught me to ride a bike and learn to swim like other normal kids? Nobody! Mom didn't ride a bike swim either. Weird. So, I never learned those things and still don't enjoy those leisures today as a grown man."
4,"Oops, only includes straight razors","A lovely book but somehow I missed that it only included straight razors. I bought it as a gift and just didn't look closely enough at the cover and contents so I missed this important detail. Otherwise, a fine looking guide for someone who collects straight razors, which my husband does not. Giving 4 stars because it's a nice book, but could have made the point more clearly to say it was only about straight razors."
1,Review of XBox Component Cable,"Cable arrived on time, however when connected to two different TV sets the image is distorted with diagonal lines running across the screen."
1,Doesn't work,"The cable didn+t worked as good as expected, it really busted the image quality on my xbox, but has some kind of interference that is showed as purple lines wavering on the screen. I tested with xbox's and two LCD and the result was the same, so I can only blame the bad quality of the cable."
4,Fits so-so but works fine as expected,"I bought a new receiver so I needed to upgrade my xbox connection from composite to component. Although I have an xbox 360, the original xbox is perfect for my little ones who like to play my ""old"" games.-FUNCTION-There's a slight visual improvement from composite -- nothing ground breaking. Also, some reviewers stated that this cable is not compatible every original xbox. If it helps, I bought the xbox that I'm using this with in 2002.-FIT-The silver connector that goes into the xbox is slightly larger than the composite one that the xbox came with. I had to jam it in there hoping it wouldn't break the xbox. As a result, it's hard to pull out (insert TWSS joke here). Minus 1 star for not fitting well.-VALUE-For under $10, this cable works fine.-RECOMMENDATION-Buy if you need to component connection. Visually, there's not a huge improvement."
1,Disappointed with the ghosting,"I purchased this cable based on positive reviews from others who had bought it here. Unfortunately, my experience with the cable was unsatisfactory.I bought the cable to connect an Xbox to a Samsung LCD TV which has two component inputs. I tried the cable on both inputs, and in all three modes (480p, 720p, 1080i). In all cases, I saw severe ghosting.I ended up purchasing a different cable from an auction seller, and it worked flawlessly - therefore I feel confident in saying that the cable I received was defective.Very disappointing, I was looking forward to being able to use the digital audio output connection too."
1,Terrible Cables,"Don't waste your money, these cables are terrible ! Horrible picture quality ! You're better off with the standard AV cables included with your xbox."
1,"Red connector non-functional, cable totally useless","There is simply no video signal in the red connector of the cable, making the picture completely green, and the cable totally useless. I tried the red audio connector in its place just to make sure it didn't get mixed up in manufacturing or something, but it had no red video signal either. TOTAL WASTE."
1,Not worth the trouble,I got this for my hubby. He has an original Xbox and wanted to play it in our hd tv. At first I thought this was a great deal boy was I wrong. Whenit arrived we plugged it in and turn on the Xbox. At first there was nothing so we check to see if they were plugged in right and they where after a few minutes the screen came up but started flicking in and out after a few seconds it when it was up there were lines running through the screen. It's not the Xbox or the tv that's messed up it the cable. So I contacted the seller and the food me it not their problem that since it was fulfilled by amazon that I would have to contact them so I did and all I am getting is. Run around from then I will not be buy from this seller again and I am considering not buying from amazon again do not waste your time on this it will only cause you unneeded stress.
2,I thought maybe???? But no.....,"I purchased this cable knowing that to go from digital to ananlog doesn't happen this way, but for the cheap price I gave it a go....but it didn't go! It was a waste of money. Live and learn (even when you know better!)"
3,2 channel SACD,"I ordered this CD after listening to Appalchian Spring performed at the Symphony. This was the very first SACD I ordered after I got my Pioneer DV-45A. Now, the music is outstanding. It's amazing at how 3 dimensional and wide the music sounds. My dislikes are stronger, however. The CD, though it is an SACD, is only recorded in 2-channels! I ordered this CD expecting to get all 5.1 channels of music. My other major gripe is the amount of background hiss. Being an SACD, I would have expected there to be practically no white noise/hiss on the recording. WRONG! There is quite a bit of the noise that is plainly audible, and you can hear it at every quiet moment of the SACD. The music is outstanding, the performance was great, BUT there are only 2 channels to listen to, and there's way too much unwanted noise for being an SACD! If I had it to do over again, I would have purchased the regular CD version of this and saved 10 bucks."
2,"Very Disappointing, predictable and boring","I was looking forward to this movie and almost went to see it in the theatre which would have pushed my rating to 1 star if I had to drive, pay AND spend that much of my time with it. It is predictable and b-o-r-i-n-g. I really could not wait for it to end. It should have been better with this interesting story and great cast, but it wasn't."
4,The Debt,"This film has very interesting plot, good acting by all particularly Sam Worthington and fine directing of a twisted situation."
1,Blah,"5 STARS= A Roller Coaster Ride, Causes an Emotional Reaction, Plot, Direction and Actor Believability4 STARS=Causes an Emotional Reaction, Plot, Direction and Character Believability3 STARS=Plot, Direction and Character Believability2 STARS=Direction and Character Believability1 STARS=Character Believability******************************************3/4 of the way through it I decided doing a online survey would be entertaining. Very disappointed by the fact the Helen Mirren just made a cameo appearance. She's the only reason I wanted to watch it. But she couldn't save it.But if you want to watch a trio of Jews and a Nazi Kung Fu fight through out the film, you may give it 2 stars. Upfront, I don't enjoy watching martial arts at all."
3,Pretty grim,"The Debt is ok and any movie with Helen Mirren is likely to be good. But if you've seen Marathon Man, I don't think you need to see this as well. The story line of The Debt is slightly different from other movies on this depressing topic, but not much."
1,GREAT story but it DRAGS,"In short - this movie should have been about an hour long. WAY too much fluff that did not really contribute. The debth of the movie is GREAT, the premis is fantastic, but it DRAAAAGGGGGGGGSS on so, to be honest I had to run back the last 15 min to find out what happened in the end because I fell asleep - and that was the best part of the whole movie. David's suicide still has me confused - yes I understand he was troubled about the lying and had spent most of his life trying to correct it, but more must have been wrong with his life to have him end it like that, very unsatisfactory."
2,Disappointing,"I feel like I've seen this movie 100 times before. It was disappointing. A subtle mix of Hanna, Munich, and James Bond. Horribly bored throughout the whole thing and I felt like I knew what was coming next the whole time. I didn't find the acting to be particularly great (amongst the younger characters). Ohwell. Could have been worse."
4,The 1960's in the land of the free............,"READ THIS BOOK!Gordon Balls' intimate recollection of a fascinating time in American history allows a vicarious experience for those unwilling or unable (due to age) to participate. I know of no better writing from a personal perspective on the exploration, freedom, generational misunderstandings and sometimes, excesses, of the 1960's. Perhaps Ball will consider an autobiography of his early teenage years, 60s experiences, and later periods and indicating how those have shaped him. One may drop acid AND love baseball, right?"
5,The Book of Why is It(s)?,"It is so refreshing to read a book full of positive thoughts. I began reading the book during my lunch hour at work and found that I was able to escape the hectic world of work. I work in a law office and it takes quite a bit to take my mind off clients, briefs and court opinions. I have purchased several copies and gave them to friends and co-workers, who have had similar positive experiences. I highly recommend it and look forward to Mr. Jones' next outing."
2,great idea but not perfect!,"The tube is a great idea; however, it only comes in small or large and most dogs are in between. It is also very dense in the mesh area and does not let much light through so my pet would feel very claustrophobic being in there. I was also thinking of using it inside my home, but it rolls around too much and can't serve that purpose. I am returning it."
2,WII Pool Party,"I didn't get a book with this, but I don't know if it would have helped. I did not like that when I got done playing a game, it put me back to the beginning like I had to start all over. Like I said I had no book and maybe it might have told me something. It's not a bad game, I enjoyed the play, but did not like going back to the beginning and a friend who borrowed it could not get it to play against somebody. Maybe that's in the book. Some may like it some not. I got rid of mine."
2,Not Great,"The product looks great and appears to be durable. It doesn't function that well though. It dispenses candy inconsistently [sometimes you get 3 m&m's, sometimes you get none]. It will accept any coin amount, so you can fill it with pennies instead of quarters [I thought I'd have control over what coins it took]. The coin-turner jams up occassionally. And it's hard to get the candy out of the bottom, it's designed at a weird angle so you often spill the candy when you're getting it out of the tray."
2,Best after you rip it apart,"I got this thing (is it painted with lead paint? don't know), and the only way I could get the gum to come out was to take it completely apart and take out the entire coin-mechanism. Works well now. In fairness, I cannot say I have noted evidence for lead poisoning."
2,Not good enough!,"I honestly can say that this dvd doesn't worth buying, because it has nothing about Aaliyah actually. It's full of people talking about Aaliyah who weren't even close to her, but met her twice.. I find this dvd pretty borring and the quality isn't good enough for dvd.The good thing about this dvd is that they show some rare cut-offs from Aaliyah's interviews, some pictures and clips from public appearances. But again, they don't show Aaliyah often, that's why this dvd is really borring..But still it's a bit better than Loosing Aaliyah which was terrible and disrespectful, but still it doesn't worth of spending your money on it in my opinion.. I wish there was a real, good dvd about Aaliyah.."
4,"Interesting book, but limited","A good book of type history, but limited to England and Northern Europe, missing the fundamental Italian and French designers."
5,Nice Size,"Great, true white color! Sturdy, classic look. Goes well with any decor, appliances. Would recommend for any sized stove top."
5,"Chilling, really moves fast.","Slatewiper is a chilling tale, especially the parts that seem to have come true since Perdue's writing of it. The Red Cross, Brotish Medical Association and others are now warning about the sort of race weapon in Slatewiper. I particularly liked the Heroine and how she struggled with her body image even after success in athletics and being an entrepreneur. She is not beautiful in a typical sense, but has a womanly beauty that appeals to me.I think a strong woman like Kate Blackwood frightens men. I like that too,The writing in this book is superb and the tension and action make it a top action thriller."
5,Flat Worked Better Than Round,I used these bungees to secure gear on my motorcycle for a 1200 mile trip through New England and they worked fantastic. Much better than the round bungees and the hooks are plastic coated so no marks left on attachment points.
1,BAD VENDOR,"I ordered this game, it came as promised. My grandson opened it and it would not turn on. After all else failed I looked in the battery compartment to discover the batteries and casing were corroded. I understand games, cd's etc may sit on the shelf for awhile but they should be checked out before sending them to a paying customer. I was very embarrassed. I've always been very pleased with items purchased through Amazon, but some of the vendors are another story"
3,MMX Fan - Had to have it,"I've been a Fan of the MMX games for SNES for a long time, and I even played X4 on my old Play Station. I wanted a bit of nostalgia so I purchased this game to work on my Wii. Unfortunately I ran into two separate problems. When on the Wii you need to use the standard video cables, I was using component cables for my Wii however, (and I have no idea why this is) the video would go black, but you could still hear the audio. An online search revealed this was a common problem but using the original cables solved it.Also, I disliked the control scheme on the game cube controller (however it is fully customize-able in each game). I found a more SNES looking game cube controller and now it's perfect."
5,Great product,I have used this product in the past I usually get it from pet meds but found it here and love the price I just saved $10. It works great and kills the fleas and there no harmful side effects.
3,Dynamic Drum Solo with Sadie,"I bought this to LEARN the choreography and DANCE it. I was very disappointed to find that the name of the music is not on the DVD, anywhere. If this is an over sight, it is a big one. I found it very frustrating to have to search and ask around (I am not the only one trying to find out what music she uses)for the name of the music that should have been provided, given that she is teaching a full performance choreography."
3,Scratches on the front of the boombox,I was disappointed that the front of the boombox was scratched on arrival. The boombox works okay so I did not send it back.
3,too tight for nikon 5000,This is a nice leather case. The only thing I would complain about is that it's a little bit tight for Nikon 5000. It doesn't fit with the lens cap on.
1,Don't Buy This Headphone,"This headphone has nothing to offer. Its sound quality is among the worst headphones that you can find. Its quality is also very bad. Definitely, this headphones is among the worst possible headphones that you can possibly find. Nady does make good headphones. Spend a little more money and get yourself a Nady QH360 which is a much better choice. If you want compact headphones, go with Sennheiser PX-100 which you can get for a little more than $30."
3,Wish I'd known it was only 1.,"Probably my fault for not paying better attention, but I really needed a pair of hinges not just one. Now I'll have to reorder."
4,I like it,Overall I like the product but the back of the shelfs wood is very flimsy and we were shorted some bolts.
4,Does not secure well to dresser,Product is of good quality and presents an appearance of furniture of greater cost. Hutch does not however securely adequately to dresser. Had to put braces on back.
4,Only The Hutch,"I bought this thinking I was going to receive everything pictured. This is the first and last time I made this mistake. Not wanting to deal with sending it back and all the hassle, I bought the dresser part from another site to complete the package.As a set I am in love with everything. It's good quality, made of both wood and ply wood. Extremely sturdy. I noticed the finish is quite delicate, It doesn't take much to scratch it. but it's still very beautiful. I imagine this being in my family for a long time. (^_^)"
1,Rebecca Scholtz,"This book seemed interesting when I saw it online, but when I read it I realized I wasted my money. Do yourself a favor and leave it on the shelf at amazon ..that's where it belongs."
4,whatever happened to janie?,"Whatever Happended to Janie is a great book.One day at lunch Janie took a drink of milk and saw her face on the milk carton which caused her to have all these visions, about her past. When she had to go and live with her birth family she couldnt ajust becuase the family that raised her was amazing and she missed them very much. How will she live with these strangers who want to be a ""whole"" family again? Readers will love Janie and feel her pain."
4,BOOK REVIEW,I REALLYIKE TGIS BOOK BECAUSE.IS WAS A MYSTERY TO SEE WHAT REALLY EVER HAPPENED TO JANIE TO IT SHOWED HOW MUCH MURDER WAS ENQUIRES
4,Whatever Happened to Janie??,"Janie Johnson just found out that the face on the milk carton was her face. She is now going to live with her real parents in New Jersey. She does not want to leave her set of parents in Connecticut. She goes from being an only child to the middle child with three brothers and one sister. This book sucks you into the story. Caroline B. Cooney took real issues and put them in to this book. I don' like to read, but when I read this book all I could think about was what was going to happen next. I would recommend this book to any one who is into mysteries."
5,Sprouting Garden,This is a great sprouting kit and has worked really well for me. Please realize though that this is not a drain through system where the water goes through all the trays from the top to the bottom. You have to fill and drain each tray. It really is easy though and they drain well. Being dark in color and not allowing the light in seems to help the sprouts sprout and grow better. Love it!
3,"Works in the short term, but not for long term use","This seemed like an easy way to get started growing herbs for cooking. They grew quickly and we used them, however, once they were ready to move into a larger container (2-3 months), they started to die. Also, I noticed flies (like ""fruit flies"") appear and sprayed them with organic plant bug killer. About two weeks later I noticed white/translucent worms in the sponge they originally grew in. I threw them away immediately.Seems like they should be able to be removed from the sponge since the roots were strong. But, the instructions said to keep them in the sponge when re-plating into a larger container."
2,Don't bother,I did everything exactly as stated and couldn't get even one of the herbs to grow at all...They came up but quickly died.
1,Nothing grew!,What a waste of time and money. At least the pots are worth a little something. Going to my neighborhood nursery to buy something worthwhile.
1,Didn't grow,"Have purchased the Chia Herb Garden multiple times before and it worked great! With the most recent purchase, the herbs never grew. I think the seeds were bad, because of the fact that it has worked great before."
4,Chia Herb Garden,"Overall, pretty good. The kit came with 4 pots and six sets of seeds. Instructions were clear, easy to follow. We chose 4 plants -- parsley, cilantro, dill and chives. Three herbs did just as predicted. Chives never sprouted. While this is disappointing, it's not surprising given the uncertainty of ""agriculture."" We haven't yet transplanted to bigger pots with soil, but are hopeful this will work well because of the strong sprouts we have right now."
1,Seeds didn't sprout,"Bought 2 sets to make this into a project for my 3 and 5 year olds. One set was missing plastic liners for the pots, had to improvise. Planted all 6 varieties and only three ever sprouted. Would not buy again."
1,No Grow!,I as very disappointed with this product. After following exact instructions and watering frequently I had no luck with the herbs grown. I believe the cilantro was the only one to even make a small appearance. I will not be buying again. It was a complete waste of money.
1,Purchased two and neither one worked,I purchased this headset from a local retailer because it was on sale. It looked nice but wasn't the most comfortable headset on the market. It's bulky and heavier than most of the newer models. I tried to use it and I could hear just fine but nobody could hear me. Everyone would tell me that it was so muffled and distorted that they could hardly understand a word that I said. So I figured I just purchased a bad one and exchanged it for a new one. I had the exact same problem with the new one plus there was a very loud and annoying buzzing noise in my ear. I absolutely wouldn't suggest this headset to anyone.
5,Seems legit enough,This product seems to be a good product for the price. I have maintained muscle mass very well using this powder. I like the packaging and size as I use this everyday for weight loss(fat not muscle).
4,Legend of the Black Scorpion,Great movie! Very artistic and visually gorgeous! Story/plot is a bit slow moving but intriguing. (Must have patience when watching this movie!)All actors are amazing! I strongly recommend this gem of a movie!
3,Nothing but problems with 2 of them,"I had one professionally installed by Verizon Wireless contractors in my wife's Honda Civic and one in my Ford Five Hundred. Her's often does not work on inbound calls. She can her the caller, caller cannot hear her. They have been troubleshooting it, but no solution after 3 weeks. We even upgraded her RAZR firmware, but still a problem. Had mine installed for 1 week and now my microphone does not work. Stone, cold dead. Does not even hear my voice commands. Very, very disappointed. When they work, sound quality is very good. Also, the Verizon installers would not hook it up to mute the radio, as they did not want to accept responsibility for any radio problems. Unfortunately, they did not tell me they would not do that until they had installed."
3,Great Idea -- But Don't Get Lost in Rome,"I saw the Rome guide in a book store -- I thought ""A guide combined with a map -- what a great idea!"" The map has major sites marked on a very colorful, graphically pleasing map. Each site is clearly labled and you can read a summary description on the other folds of the map. Cool...right?! Not if you get lost. This is a general map. It has major streets marked on it. If you actually find yourself on any side street in Rome, it is unhelpful. (Rome is *full* of crooked little side streets). This is not ""The Only Guide You Need"". You need to obtain an accurate map of Rome."
1,How could something like this come out!!!!!!,"Simply horrible!!! Never heard anything like this before and hope to never hear it again. See you have another album coming out huh. Hahahahahahaha!!! What a joke!! I'll never buy it! What possessed you gals to be rappers because whatever it was you should go back and slap it. Sorry but you gals are not there yet. Keep working at it. But until you're there, STOP BRINGING THIS OUT TO THE PUBLIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not worth purchsing,"As a long time licorice fan but recently counting carbs to stave off type II diabetes, I was anxious to try these. To my dismay, I found that one serving contains 110 calories and 22 garms of carbohydrates. My disappointment turned to disgust when I tasted them. There is very little flavor in these. If you are looking for a pleasant tasting treat and cannot have sugar/carbs do not purchase these. There are plenty of other decent tasting sugar free and diabetic friendly treats available other than this product."
5,Why arent these guys bigger?,"You know the amount of times ive seen this album in sale bins really surprises me.Its obvious they havent listened to the album before pricing it,Because its one of the best albums ive picked up.Its basically gothic metal/rock and the standard of the music is miles above mediocre yet almost mainstream bands like lacuna coil and the like.The song structures are great it has hugely catchy melodies,the one thing that is noticable is the vocalist,it seems he doesnt have a great grasp of the englsih language.But none the less its a small price for an album this great.This band should be placed amongst bands like Lacrimosa and Within Temptation not thrown in the sales bin.Grab it if you get the chance."
5,HARDCORE PRIDE!!!!!!!!,"A perfect murder is a band from my hometown: Drummondville. But unlike others bands from this town (Low Fat these guys do not rock!!!) APM dudes knows what real hardcore is! so it makes Cease to suffer one of the best hardcore records ever! So please, encourage some of my friends and buy cease to suffer!!!! Or if they are in concert near of your town, go to see these dudes live you will not regret it I swear to god!!!!!!"
5,Excellent single...,"What can i say about Paulinas debut English single... Its very upbeat, and after a few listens its really kinda catchy. The video is similar to Kylies video for In Your Eyes. But thats where the similarities end. The video is eye catching, and is a perfect compliment to the song. Seeing as how this track is getting major airplay, video play (MTV), and racing up the Top 100, its a safe bet to say that Paulina has her first English language hit with Dont Say Goodbye."
3,"Great Series, Poor Video Quality DVD","I really enjoy Ultraseven, my favorite of the Ultra series, and have been looking forward to this subtitled DVD. Audio quality OK, and subtitles are adequate. Video quality is poor. Compression makes the image seem very grainy, passable but not good. Pulldowns seem to have been applied in error, causing juddering ghosts in any scene with tilts or pans, which is very annoying and distracting, and detracts from the viewing.I am very surprised and disappointed, as I have seen the Japanese DVD's, and the video and audio quality (all remastered into stereo with 5.1 on some episodes) are excellent on those. I would have thought that a properly licensed release would have made those materials available to Shout Factory."
5,This is my third one.,"Works great, looks great. Just keep it out of the spokes of your bike or you'll have to replace it like I did."
5,very nice umbrella,"great value - i love the no-blowing-inside-out advantage of the umbrella,, and i like the classic look."
2,it breaking so easily..,I found this on sale and it was worth every penny. I usually just grab one of the cheap umbrellas but I was tired of them breaking so easily. It is built sturdy and looks worth more than it cost. I haven't used it much so only time will tell...
2,won't stay closed!,"Purchased three of these umbrellas (one was the smaller ""metro"" umbrella.) All have been sturdy and have held up through all kinds of storms and wind. But they all have one major defect -- they will not stay closed! The clasp does not jut out far enough and when I close the umbrellas they pop back open within a few seconds. My other (cheaper) umbrellas have never had this problem. This forces me to give these only two stars instead of five. Definitely would not purchase again."
3,Stated diameter is incorrect,"I specifically bought this umbrella based on its description of being 48 inches ""in diameter."" Umbrella companies seem to make their products appear larger by stating the ""arc"" size, which is larger than the ""diameter."" However, Amazon specifically states the diameter is 48 inches. The actual diameter of this umbrella is 38 inches at its narrowest point (it's a polygon) to 42 inches at its widest point. The point of using the arc measurement is stupid because, in theory, you could have one of those 1970s bubble umbrellas that has an arc of 100 inches, but a diameter of 30. However, the umbrella is still good for its size. I just wanted a larger umbrella."
5,"""A GREAT FAMILY MOVIE""",My family and I watched this movie during our family movie night and we LOVED it! I have 2 sons (6 & 8 years old). In the beginning I wasn't sure if it was going to be a slow movie for them but we soon find out that it had some action and funny moments. We really enjoyed it and most of all we were very happy that the movie didn't have anything that we would have to explain to our kids later. This movie is going to be one of our Christmas favorite and for sure we recommend it not only during Christmas season but anytime you want to have family time!
5,Quite The Rare Treat,"Can't even describe the high quality and the natural sound of this album...This sounds better then Studio recordings and it isLIVE! Simply astonishing.And it's packaged beautifully, I wonder if Fantasy willput out a 24bit version of this material?!I hope so!Love Jazz and it will love you..."
5,Great DVD features and film,"Very impressive. The film, well you've seen the reviews here about the actual documentary and how this is an essential companion to Control and all that's true. But the Joy Division DVD is loaded with features including several bonus interviews which really adds to the original film. A very striking post-film bit on the special features is Sumners whining about U2. Wow, he really goes off on U2 and how they ""ripped off"" JD. Huh? Just a very brief rant but very telling on Sumners' frame of mind which is bitter to say the least. I guess selling 20 million albums as New Order wasn't satisfactory enough. JD's a great band, but U2 they ain't, sorry. Still, this DVD is excellent. Get it. Interesting footnote and historical fact, the final segment of the actual film closes out with the song ""Atmosphere"" as a music bed, EXACT same musical ending as in Control."
2,Not the best,"I've had two of them on my boat for the last 4 years. In that time, I've had to rebuild(bad impeller) once on one and twice on other. One is still running just fine but other gave up the ghost again after only a couple of uses. Considering that they only get pumped, maybe twice a month, that's 24 times a year(maybe)for a total usage of 96 times where they run for maybe 90 seconds and yet they had to be rebuilt of just failed after being rebuilt. Not the best macerator.For fairness, I installed them to replace two Jabsco Macerators that had totally rotted out inside the units. They still spun when the button was pushed but there was nothing left in the pump to rotate."
5,CHRISTMAS TV FAVORITES (DR. SEUSS HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS/THE YR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS/ETC.,FLAWLESS TRANSACTION WITH A PLATINUM SELLER WHOM I HIGHLY RECOMMEND; THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT!
3,"Fun, but slender. . . .","This slender volume is part of a series put together by Randall Bedwell. Overall, this series is quite a bit of fun. Quotations in various volumes come from US Grant, Joshua Chamberlain, James Longstreet, Stonewall Jackson. . . . The books are quite brief, but the quotations are enjoyable to read.Here, the focus is on General Robert E. Lee. There are quotations by Lee--and quotations about Lee by others, such as Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis, and James Longstreet.Among Lee's quotations: ""My loyalty to Virginia ought to take precedence over that which is due to the federal government."" ""Apparent failure often proves a blessing."" ""I am truly grateful to the Giver of Victory for having blessed us in our terrible struggle. I pray He may continue.""Again, a lot of fun!"
4,Details is great but it doesn't really have a scent,"This is a very hard to find product. I'm big into fishing so i had to have it. Frankly i don't care but it doesn't smell really at all. If you put it right up to your nose you can smell it but it isn't strong enough to make your car smell. But i didn't buy it for that really anyway, i just wanted it to hang from my mirror."
2,Not what I expected,This is partially narrated and partially just the dialogue from the movie. It doesn't do anything to transition from a visual movie to audiobook. Not worth having.
5,rpgdella,"Everything Timex says about the watch is true. So far, the ONLY thing that hasn't worked 100% is the Timex Flix system to turn on the indiglo light. I own other Ironman watches and it does work in them. The push button works fine. Could just be this one, but certainly NOT a deal breaker. I'm in the trades and it seems to hold up well under tough conditions. I'll buy another one when I need it.If you take a little time to care for them, they""ll take care of time for you !!!"
3,One Drawback,"The functionality and appearance of the watch is fine. However, the stainless steel back gives my son a rash on his arm. He is sensitive to nickel. Stainless steel is supposed to be OK for people with nickel allergy, but the particular type of steel they use still triggers a reaction. We've had to paint the back with clear nail polish. So - beware, if you have a nickel sensitivity."
2,Disappointed!,"I ordered this book due to the excellent reviews it had, but i was very disappointed. The book is very outdated and for a newbie, I thought the instructions weren't very clear."
5,"Review of Pat Donohue ""Backroads""","I Love this CD! After I saw him play live, I had to have this CD. Pat Donohue is a Master Acoustic Guitar player with poet's heart. The lyrics are deep and real, it's nice to hear someone sing from the heart. There is song on here called ""I don't worry about the Blues"" which is a beautiful song I dedicated to my wife. It's exactly what I want to say but just couldn't get out. Pat Donohue is one of those Masters that noone really hears much about, but is on higher level that many don't appriciate. I do, and I think you will too."
1,Good concept but bad material,The problem with this opener is that the dark blue plastic (the outer part) is not flexible. It is very stiff plastic and it broke the first time I used it.
5,This works great!,"My husband and I were both having great difficulty opening jars, and found this to work well on every jar that we've used it on. Because of the reviews that say it has snapped in two, we have been careful about the way we use it; we don't hold it at the tips of the handles; instead we grip it right at the place where it goes around the jar top that we're using it on."
3,Jar Opener,I had high hopes for this as it is hard for me to open jars anymore but it is really not that good....seems to slip on jars when trying to use it.
1,Don't waste your money,"Went looking for a jar opener like this after seeing my grandmothers. Purchased 2, one for myself and one for my mom. We both attempted to use them for the first time today and both of them snapped right in half. Disappointing and a waste of money. Have contacted seller for refund."
5,Handy Tool,I got this for the occasional jar that just doesn't want to open. I now use it on most jars. It is much easier on the fingers and hands.
4,Good product.,"Very helpful for my arthritic hands. Tool has muliple size choices and holds can, jar or bottle tight while I open. Makes the opening process much less painful."
3,tradicional psychobilly,"the band less fast than i likes, but this cd is composity by good sounds, in the style.if you wants a slow psychobilly , get them and enjoy it !!"
5,Knowledge is the Beginning and the Ramallah Concert,Extraordinarily important and beautiful documentaries. EVeryone concerned about the troubles in our world will find hope and promise in the Barenboim-Said collaboration and the process they created that enables gifted young musicians from different worlds learn to make exquisite music together.
4,worth buying,"Some of the pieces in this cd are in this collection only,this alone should be a reason to buy if you are a Rossini fan. On top of that, the Bolzano Haydn Orchestra conducted with firm hand by Alun Francis is a pleasant reality. We do not have all the Rossini sparks but not too far from it and even more celebrated complexes could not do much better than this. Very glad I got it."
2,DON'T DO IT.......,"This book is horrible, I bought this book because it had 4 stars, please take it a step further and read the reviews before you purchase this book, I have been reading this book for 3 days, (That's a long time for me,, I'm usually done by then) and I have literally fallen asleep reading it on several occasions because it has nothing to hold your interest, this is the second and last book I've purchased by this author, GWYNNE IT'S TIME TO RETIRE........."
2,Bad CD quality,"The CD player has a continuous whine as it plays CDs - we certainly don't want to wake up to that, and wouldn't use it to listen to CDs either. We got a Timex model instead (T625B), which works great."
1,Don't buy,"The hiss of the mechanism was louder than the music, and it even buzzed just sitting there doing nothing. Also, the instructions, written to be understandable to any language, were incomprehensible. I'm sending it back; I found something far better for less than half the price!"
5,Bill & Gloria... You Got It Goin' On!!!,"Well, after two years of not even writng a review on anything - it took Bill and Gloria Gaither to get me back up and going to let you know just how powerful and awesome their mucic is.I am a somewhat new listener to B & G and their freinds - I 1st experienced the joy they emit in 1999. I've been hooked ever since.I chose to reveiw ""So Glad"" because its a very fitting place to start. I am so glad to have found this music and am so glad to see the recent success this music has found in America.I really feel like these Homecoming Freinds are now part of my family. Southern Gospel is now my favorite kind of music. It has changed my whole outlook on life and brought me much closer to God. What more can I say... I'm just so glad!"
5,What a lifesaver!,"From the eyecatching cover to the easy-to-use spiral binding, this book jumped out at me. As a new mom of five month old, I find the book invaluable for keeping track of things! Kudos to the authors for such a great resource for new moms like me."
3,Not Flexible Enough,"I returned this book because I didn't think I would use it enough. Many of the sections are good ideas, but the book is not flexible. For instance, the emergency section doesn't have enough slots for all our phone numbers (cell, beeper, etc.), and the car care section has only four or five spaces for all car servicing...you'd use it up in a year. There is room for only two children. And the book is too heavy to tote easily to doctors, etc. A 3-ring-binder format might have made it more expandable. It's a very cute looking book but I think it would just sit in my shelf. I am going to make my own ring binder with this information in it...not as cute but suits me better."
1,Isogesis at its best.,"Get a grip!!! This is one of the best examples of distorting the Word of God that is in print and not to mention a disservice to African American Churches committed to teaching and preaching an unadulterated Gospel. The author and adherents to this line of thinking would do well to REREAD Gal.1:6-8. I would also question the credibility of any seminary or institution that seriously subscribes to the ideology advocated by this book.Gal 3:33 Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?NKJV"
4,"When they say trivia, they mean it!","I expected a book of facts and information. Instead it is a quiz book and I failed miserably although I THOUGHT I could count myself as totally knowledgable about Jimmy Buffett. Read all his books, listened to his records, tapes and CD's. Watched the videos.....and didn't know diddly when it came to these tests! Truly not for the casual fan....I'm a parrothead through and through and never achieved the highest levels. Close a couple times, though!"
1,Terrible,"What type of person writes a christian book when he himself left his wife and 3 children, for a new family and never looked back. Hope writing this book made him feel better."
4,"You buy this for cleaning kit, bot case","Yes, the case is cheap and sucks. The value is the cleaning fluids, rod and some swatches. If you priced all that you get out separately you would pay more. I clean my guns once a month at least, the box and supplies do fine. If you plan on cleaning your guns daily and require a sturdy case I think there are better options for you. Hoppe's is a great product that has been cleaning and making guns go boom for over a decade, great product and this is a nice bundle for the recreational to avid shooter."
3,"Solid Performances by Sidney Toler,Mantan Moreland and Benson Fong in Mediocre Film",I like CHARLIE CHAN IN THE SECRET SERVICE although I agree with some of the other reviewers that this low budget movie has many obvious shortcomings.For the Chan fan it is still an entertaining entry about a scientist who dies mysteriously in his home which is full of house guests.His plans for a new torpedo are missing and the guests are the leading suspects in both the theft of the plans and the possible murder of the scientist.Charlie Chan is called in as an agent of the Secret Service to assist in the case.Sidney Toler plays the part of Charlie Chan and he is joined by Benson Fong as Tommie Chan and Marianne Quon as Iris Chan. The cast also includes the excellent comic Mantan Moreland.The producers were Philip N. Krasne and James S. Burkett. The director was Phil Rosen and the screenplay was written by George Callahan.
3,It's not quite vintage style,"Mantan Moreland is just starting to exhibit his humor in this offering. Even Sidney Toler seems to be getting used to his new home at Monogram studios in this film. i believe it was the first of the budget Monogram offerings in the Charlie Chan series. That would explain why it seems slightly stiff. The mystery is good. So are the gimmicks. i liked it, but didn't 'love' it. It's not my favorite, but of historical worth."
2,Grainy - Not For Plasma or Large Screen,"Very grainy resolution. Some shots look as if done with a home video camera. Bland shots, fish not colorful enough for any use. Had intended to use as a background experience with music but poor quality of dvd makes my Sony 42"" plasma seem cheap.Overall -- not what I was expecting. Expected sharp, deep, colorful sceens."

3,"Nice, but tuner is annoying","I like this unit. The only flaws are the lack of a digital tuner and the lack of tuner presets. There is a digital display of the tuner frequency, but a dial must be turned to adjust the frequency. It would be perfect with a digital tuner and tuner presets.The display is large enough and bright enough for me to read in the middle of the night without my glasses. That is a big plus. The radio sound quality and the phone are fine."
2,So so item.,"Screen time hard to read, too bright snooze button that flashes when alarm radio goes off, phone receiver audio tinny. Learning curve to operating buttons. It's ok but just ok."
1,Beware of major rip-off,"I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this dvd. It is interactive only on the most basic level. There is a chart inside the package that illustrates the limited interactive choices. The problem is, you have no clue as to how bad it is until you try to play it. Picture a 15 minute movie where nothing happens. This is the first dvd I have purchased where I have felt like I had been robbed. Do not buy I'M YOUR MAN."
1,All of her books are like this one... useless,"As a gallery owner, I was unimpressed by the quantity and more importantly the quality of information included in this book. I have ordered and read all of her books and unfortunately it just isn't worth the price, time or effort."
1,DONT ORDER THIS UNTIL YOU MAKE SURE IT ISNT HERITAGE,"The wrong CD was shipped to me for the 2nd time from Amazon. For the 2nd time ( I returned this item already) I received a CD called HERITAGE by the same artist. After sending back to source, I waited a while, then ordered this item again (Carolina Chocolate Drops & Joe Thompson) NOT HERITAGE, but received HERITAGE again.I am keeping HERITAGE to give to someone but am disppointed that the wrong CD was sent twice. Must be some sort of organizational error."
4,A LOT of assembly required,"A fine doll house for my daughter, but be warned: A LOT of assembly is required. I think the assembly instructions were about 35 pages long. I kept hoping that someone would send over Jimmy Carter and a Habitat for Humanity crew to help out."
3,Dollhouse Was Missing A Wall!,"I ordered the dollhouse after reading the wonderful reviews. I started putting it together and realized I was missing a whole outside wall! I called the company and they sent one out, but the wall they sent had screw holes different from the instructions so had to drill my own which was a real pain! It does look nice now that it is all put together, but was disappointed when I started...and then had to stop putting it together for over a week!"
3,Nice House,I bought this for my daughter(4.5) for Christmas. She doesn't play with it as much as I thought but I think she will grow into it.This toy is not for children who are tough on toys. The furniture has some delicate and some sturdy pieces. There was a small piece on the house that was broken and my husband had to glue it and it is fine now.I agree with the reviews that the kitchen furniture is too much and for us the oven keeps opening. The Victorian doll family doesn't bend very well and my daughter was frustrated that they only come with one set of clothes (we will try the polly pockets!).I would still recommend it for children 5+ as the ideal age. I am looking forward to getting some of the accessories (I tend to straighten the house up too).I would rate the house a 4 and the furniture 3.7 and the dolls 3 out of 5.
1,Dairy in toothpaste!,My son has a severe dairy allergy and there is dairy in this toothpaste! Even if your child doesn't have a dairy allergy children should not have cows milk until they are a year old.
5,Great tasting product,My kid hates brushing his teeth but at least this product has a good taste to it that helped the whole nightly process go smoother.
5,Gummyliscious,I like this product but be careful to use after three months and please be careful with the thimble like application it can potentionally be a choking hazard
3,"Funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn, but tooooooooooooooooo EASY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I got this game the day it came out on June 16 at BestBuy, and I beat the fricken game in 5 DAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Only 5 Days! I really love the surprises and how Lan moves, but this game was too easy! It should have gone on longer. I have BN3:Blue, and it took me about 2-3 months for me to beat it! That's how long it should have taken me to beat BN5:Team Protoman, and BN6: Cybeast Gregar! If you're a HUGE Megaman fan like me, then you should get this game! But if you're not that big of a Megaman fan, then it not worth you're money!"
1,Flawed Design,"Whenever I attempt to use this, it blows the lighter fuse in my car. I attempted this three times under varying conditions, with various items plugged in. I think it has something to do with the leads coming too close together under the cap -- I unscrewed it, and they come within about 1/16th inch of contact."
