4,This does help.....,"I live in an old farmhouse that has been renovated several times. Blending the old with the new is nice, however you end up with some ""gaps"". These allow the woodland creatures free range for getting into the house! Traps worked, but catching them one at a time and resetting the traps was too much. Then I read about the peppermint oil. I soaked some cotton rounds and place them in and around the kitchen draws and pantry. At first the smell is very strong but pleasant. It wears off in a few days and I think the mice get used to it. I worked for a while, but you have to continually resoak the cotton. After the smell was gone, the mice were back. Eventually, I gave up and used decon. I hate to do that, but so far the mice are definately gone! I would suggest to use the peppermint first. It does work, but I guess it depends on how many rodents you have to chase away! Good luck."
3,Does what you'd expect,"The good: It's a great size, perfect for small jobs. Looks good (mine is black). Chops very well.The bad: The motor isn't very smooth -- it vibrates more than I expected it to. The holes in the lid are too small -- liquid drizzles in far too slowly, even when just using one hole like recommended. I suppose if they were any bigger, stuff inside would splash out though."
4,Excellent and brilliant,I like the way Calle 13 mixes up sounds and words to express their songs-especially when they are repetitive on such tracks as Atrevete-te-te. I like the way they jumble sounds. I like the way the instrumentation is done with different sounds going in and out such as the brass.
1,UGH! Walked out of the Class,"I took several of Kay Arthur's classes on various books from the Bible but advise you...don't waste your time with this course. After several sessions, I walked out of class due to the lies given on the subject. After speaking with several other Christian counselors, it is obvious Kay is still in need of healing, as portrayed by the contents of this course. There are still some issues that need to be resolved. I guess if you were brought up in a Christian home and overly protective, you would fall for the context. However, if you have any street smarts or experienced the secular world, before coming to Christ, you would be offended.I do recommend her classes and books on specific books of the Bible and Spiritual gifts."
5,the Bomb,"this is exactly what I was looking for. I have really fine hair so I dont know how it will work on thick hair , but I love mine and wouldn't trade it for the world."
2,doesn't work well,It didn't work well. Not enough heat or steam. Hair got stuck in it. I sent it back. They were excellent on the return and my credit. Thank you!
1,Good book of comparisons,"This book was basically an examination of the modern views to Grant with a great amount of comparisons to Napoleon, Walpole, Montgomery and Ike. This should have been titled ""Famous Generals of WWII with Historical American Connections."" Mr. Korda is a native of the UK and uses his knowledge of its history to always let the heroes in Europe, and his past biographical subjects (Monty and Ike) appear on every other page (Literally, EVERY OTHER PAGE). There was one part in particular that was supposed to describe Grant's appearance but instead talked of Monty's ""unassuming beret"" and Ike's ""jacket"" and Churchill's(another major character in this book) ""unflapibilty."" Enjoy it if you like historical parrallels to Grant and a host of European notables. It was a waste of a Christmas gift."
1,This book should not be sold,"This was a marginal effort when it was released back in 1997. It sold only because it was one of the few PeopleSoft books on the market. Now that it's old, it is simply sad that any retailers are still selling this, or moreover that the publisher (Manning) is still pushing it.Calling this book merely bad would be generous."
1,Your return on investment would be scant at best,I bought the book after completing a PeopleSoft project and found it lacking any substantive value
2,Misleading title and mostly fluff,"When I bought this book, this was the only Peoplesoft book around. The author seems to spend more time in trying to tell readers of this book how to treat a consultant, most of the book is fluff, however it does give some basic information on the company, and its origins and some of its cult like behaviour.Im still waiting for a good book on Peoplesoft that actually covers financials like the Oracle financials handbook written by David James and Graham Seibert.However as an independent consultant, I do like the fact that he asks to treat us with awe and work the employees schedules around us (honest thats what he says)."
4,A Great Civll War book for Kids,"I read this book in third grade (I'm 56 now). It was the first war-related book I ever read. I loved it, especially the battle maps showing how the various forces were arrayed. The names of generals were forever etched in my mind--Longstreet, Jackson, Burnside, Ewell, Meade, McClellen, Hancock, Reynolds, Sherman, Hood, Bragg, Early, Hill.... Each chapter tells the story of a different major battle. The book is aimed at kids. I've still got my copy on a shelf in my home. It created an enduring interest in the Civil War."
5,Beautiful !,"When I first heard this cd...few years back , I could not belive my hear . Who is that ? A tres plyed like a flamenco guitar , what a great sound ! I cant recommend enough this group , and I play this cd almost weekly since I bought it .Music is about intense emotion , this cd is one of them ."
5,A New Knob,I've had this for about 3 yrs? Mine looks just like the one pictured but has a plastic knob. We have never made coffee in this but instead we make cider every year after we return from cutting down our Christmas tree. We have had no problem to speak of yet. It seems from the neg. reviews the glass knob is the problem not the actual urn itself. So far so good
1,Big problem,The coffee maker quit working after a few uses. The manufacturer representative has been very helpful and has offered to replace it.
4,Knice Knife,"I've been using this for a few weeks and overall it has been a ""Knice"" Knife.OK, I am lousy in the kitchen and I don't really know what I'm doing, but this seems like a Knice Knife to me. Our prior and now co-existing kitchen knife is another less expensive Wusthof. When I compare it to this new Wusthof Le Cordon Bleu it is noticeable that my new Wusthof is much sharper, lighter, and feels better in my hand - I like it. The old one will probably go bye-bye...how do you safely dispose of knifes anyway (doesn't seem safe to toss in the Goodwill bag).Overall, 4 stars with the -1 docked for price/value."
1,Worst Blades Ever!,"I purchased these wiper blades based on Consumer Reports' assessment as well as the positive feedback from Amazon reviewers. Unfortunately my experience was different.These blades are the worst I've ever had on a car. I currently own a Lexus GX 470 and wanted to purchase new wiper blades to prepare for the rainy season. I purchased the 21"" and 22"" blades (passenger and driver side) a little over a month ago and installed them last week.These wiper blades will drive you nuts! They stutter and skip badly. I tried cleaning my windshield really good and cleaned the blades with alcohol, to no avail.I ended up reinstalling the older blades which I purchased from Target, and now I have my sanity back.Since I've had them for over a month, it would have cost me more to return them to Amazon than what I actually paid for them... So threw them in the garbage!I might have had a bad batch, but my advice to you, just choose another brand."
2,Built like a rock.. but shoots like one too.,Built like a rock.. but shoots like one too. The gun is put together well enough for its pig steel parts. But it literally shoots the pellets about 3 feet. Great for a 5 year old though.
2,Betsy Blair Ends Up Losing!,"A forever fan of Gene Kelly, I was eager to learn more about his marriage to Betsy Blair. Alas, she comes across as substantially less than the sum of her parts. I ended up actively disliking her, and gaining a better appreciation of Gene Kelly for putting up with her."
5,my #1 movie,"this movie has it all, i laughed so hard, i thought i was going to break a rib! this movie is very immature in a good way. please check this one out if u have a good sense of humor."
5,Everyone wants one,"This is great for when company comes over. After we use it, everyone asks where we got it from. It is very easy to use and cooks very well. We usually cook meat and veggies on top and melt cheese in the bottom. It is also very easy to clean up."
5,A good price,"I found this while looking for raclette grills to replace my St√∂ckli 4-person grill, which has been outgrown despite having served us well. This appears to be an excellent buy. Most raclette grills do not have temperature controls since the process is to grill the cheese and then serve it over your cold meats (sopressata, bressaola, coppacola, anchovies) and potatoes (www.raclette-suisse.ch has more recipes for those new to this dish). Raclette has become a pizza substitute for us since my wife is gluten sensitive and there are lots of ways to enjoy raclette. One barrier to the enjoyment of this in the US has been the price, which this grill provides a very good inexpensive grill that is good for parties or large families."
2,Not a great book,"I would only suggest this book if you have a lot of patience and determination to make sense of the authors code. The source code has bugs, and many many memory leaks. It isn't even formatted correctly. In order to make sense of it, I had to tab and format it correctly. Not fun. There are much easier ways to do animation than what the book describes. If you really want to know how X files work then get this book, otherwise skip it."
1,Try to be more realistic will ya?,"This video was okay if you've never picked up a pair of chucks in your life. But for someone like me who practices consistently, it was very boring. Most of the techniques were take downs and traps. I consider techniques like that a waste of time for the nunchakus. Maybe some of you will like this video because of that but I feel that if the chucks are spinning constantly they are more effective. Another thing about the techniques used was that they were not very realistic for street self defence. If any of you would like to talk (intelligently) to me about this video, juse e-mail me at Tasuki8472@home.com"
3,"Interesting, but not what I want in a Brian May album.","This soundtrack is almost entirely instrumental- often a good thing when you're talking about Brian May, but most of the tracks are dramatic background filler music with variations on the same melody. There's some French dialog mixed in, which is pretty unremarkable. There are a few unusual songs mixed in that are interesting, but not very enjoyable. Maybe I was mistaken in hoping for more typical Brian May- maybe something like the songs he wrote on the Highlander /A Kind of Magic album/soundtrack. This soundtrack is more like the Flash album, only slightly more listenable. Ultimately Furia is more about the movie than about Brian May, which may be good for moviegoers, but not for me."
5,JUST BEAUTIFUL!,The pictures of Elvis in this book are breathtaking! You feel as though you can just reach out and touch him. Ed Bonja has done a beautiful job of capturing Elvis at his best on stage. If you're an Elvis fan- this is a worthwhile book to own.
3,Good concepts but dated of course,Bought it because it was so cheap compared to the recent one in print. Concepts still apply...except for the commentary about how solid mortgage backed securities are. Bahahahaha.
2,too confusing,"There was probably a good story somewhere in this rambling, disjointed mess - but I stopped looking for it after the first half. The author definitely has talent but desperately needs a decent editor. What a shame."
1,Don't bother.,"I was expecting a DVD of Manson's polished music videos, but this is just cheap footage of early Manson concerts. The sound and video quality are extremely poor and very cheesy. It is obviously home-made by someone who didn't care what they were producing - Manson would never release this trash. Once you open the package, you notice that this DVD is part of a series of ""Greatest Hits"" of dozens of artists. The first thing I saw upon opening the case was Elvis staring back at me on the cover of the brochure for this greatest hits series. I couldn't bear to watch more than a few seconds of each clip, then I returned it."
1,Folgers Come On,"I am sorry Mr. Amazon, but I was deeply dissapointed with my purchase of a $59.00 container of Folgers. I guess I am losing it as I thought for some reason that there was going to be more than one container. I thought 3 for some reason. Oh well you live and learn. I will be more careful in the future.Joan from Maryland"
5,Good belt,Works great on my 2006 tj. No noise from under hood seems like it will last. The belt has been on jeep for awhile now thru hot and cold weather still going strong. If you have a jeep tj 1997 thru 2006 great buy.
2,Wrong size for my ford sport trac,Quality looked good and I read some great reviews before buying. I just wish it fit my truck. It said it did so imagine my surprise. It was about an inch larger than the stock belt and made the worst shreaking noise I have ever heard. I ended up going to NAPA and getting one that fits.
3,not worth the price,"I'm glad they lowered the price for this, but it still isn't low enough. I was very dissapointed to spend the money on this ""volume"" that was very short for the price. It was cute, but like I said short for the price."
5,"Terrific Price, Fast Shipping, Very Well made",This hat really shocked me as to how well it is made and the price was unbelievable. The company shipped fast too. I even called them just to say thanks for the hat. What a bargain!
3,Time travel and the church,"Set in an alternate reality, where the Spanish Empire and the Catholic Church run most of the world, this story follows a member of the time police. A great adventure."
5,Important issues in psychology and culture,"Victor de Munck has produced a most insightful presentation of some of the major issues in contemporary psychological anthropology. He has done so in a text that is easy to read and understand, but subtle in its presentations of the contending positions and deeply thoughtful in its analysis and evaluation of these. The specialist will be given much solid food for thought, while the student will quickly gain a substantial sense of why these issues are important and of what makes them exciting."
5,"Quick, Concise, and Scary","Roger Canfield made his point clearly... Through a web of front companies, the Chinese military is slowly taking control of key American ports giving them nearly uncontrolled access to cities on both coasts.Stealth Invasion's back cover quotes President George W. Bush saying ""We must confront the threats that come in a shipping container or a suitcase."" Dr. Canfield proves President Bush's point in an easy to read 96 page book."
4,Must have,"If you need more zoom, this is the item. If you have a lens larger than f2beware, do some reading. Otherwise must have."
3,Canon Extender 2x,"Canon EF 2X II Extender Telephoto AccessoryI purchased this item to expand the telephoto range of my 70-200 2.8 IS lens. Although I have to surrender two stops, the extender works great--so long as you use a tripod. The image stabilizaton is not enough to compensate for using a solid tripod."
1,VERY UNSATISFIED,"At first I was exited to get this product, particularly because it was a Canon product that would compliment my Canon EOS Rebel camera and EF lens. However, I was very disappointed to learn after the fact that the EF 2X II extender is NOT compatible to all Canon EF lenses, in my case...the 75-300mm EF telephoto lens. This was a significant detail NOT indicated in the Amazon advertisement. When I contacted the vendor (DB Roth), I explained that I was not aware the product did not fit my lens. I felt like I was brushed off and simply told to call the manufacturer. Long story short...I called Canon who tried to help, but they confirmed there are in fact various Canon lenses that are incompatible. In the end...I went back to the vendor (DB Roth), who reluctantly agreed to give me a refund. However, they accepted no responsibility for NOT stating incompatibility issues in the Amazon advertisement and had the audacity to charge me a $30 restocking fee, which they deducted from my refund!"
1,What a mess!,"I used to own this thing, or should I say ""Beast"". The concept is great: Precisely measured grounds from pot-to-pot. However, what you don't see on the box is the mess it makes when you pull out the plastic receptacle. Grounds spray out when the lid is removed. More grounds fall out when you try to dump them into the coffee maker. Add to that the fact that you have to tap on the bottom because the oils in the coffee cause it to clump along the sides. It's even worse in the winter when it's dry with a lot of static. Coffee goes everywhere. It's more mess than it's worth."
5,Thomas Crazy!,Our grandson Easton is crazy for 2 things and those are for John Deere and Thomas the train. So when looking for a Christmas gift we found this set of movies and knew it would be a hit with him and his parents. He will watch Thomas for hours and i am sure our son and his wife will enjoy a little time to get things done. Thank you. Cindy
1,Incredibly scary for a youngster,We only made it until Percy went to the Diesel Works before we had to turn it off. Way too dark and scary for a toddler. Should have assumed as such with scary Diesel 10 laughing menacingly at the end of Misty Island Rescue. Incredibly disappointing. Even the fire at the beginning was a bit much.
1,Thomas & Friends Day of the Diesels,"We bought this as a Christmas present, 21 days after the order was placed and just before Christmas, it arrived. When the DVD/gift was opened and played it was discovered that it can only be played in America (where it came from). For some reason it cannot be played in any DVD player, Blue Ray or Computer/Lap Top, despite are ability to play other international non Zone 4 titles. As we are past the 28 day period since purchase we have no way of contacting the seller and asking for a change or refund. I hope other people from Zone 4; Australia/New Zealand are a bit more cautious than I was. Would you please consider exchanging or refunding in this instance? Thank you."
4,"Love the new characters, but feel this is for 4 and older kids...","My son loves Thomas and Friends... and was very happy to meet two new characters!!!Loves Flynn and Belle, as he is obsessed with fire trucks/engines at this time.I did feel as though the story with the Diesels was a bit older though, as he was not really into it at first... Maybe a bit to ""deep"" for him?But he has asked to watch it since then and likes it, just doesn't care for the Diesel crew! :)"
5,Hal Leonard's Vocal Library is the new standard.,"I have a multitude of Hal Leonard Vocal Library publications in my library and I am very pleased with the quality... especially for the price. Even at full price (which I have yet to pay for one of these gems at Amazon), they are well worth it. I recommend ""The Vocal Library"" to students and educators alike."
5,Joshua made me laugh and cry--I saw it twice in two days.,"Joshua is a Christian movie that also appeals to non-Christians like myself and my family. It's hard to say much without giving away the movie's secret, but it is the story of small town USA and the winsome stranger who comes to visit and change the lives of the people who live there. There's lots of humor and loveable characters, and several very moving moments. The acting was wonderful. I'm trying to think of another movie to compare it to, and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" comes to mind."
4,Jesus is coming to town.,"Whether you're Hindu or atheist, I bet if you actually met Jesus on the street you'd like him. That's about what this movie boils down to-A town meeting Jesus in our time frame. He's just a guy who pops up and tries to help. Not the hype and craze we here about Him. I think this is a wonderful new look at Christ. The only reason I gave it for stars and not five is: the ending was too dragged out by about fifteen minutes. The film is slow and sweat, not too slow; but definitely not the type for everybody. If you like idyllic circumstances, romances, a fun religious commentary, or a chance to see a different perspective of Christ. I'm sure you'll love this film."
1,Joshua,"I have never received my order placed on 2/16/09. I contacted the seller asking for tracking information on 3/18/09 and have not heard from the seller yet. The only reason I gave them 1 star is that I need this review to register. I can understand if there was a problem or if the package was accidentally delivered to the wrong address by the mail, but I should have heard back from the seller after my 3/18/09 correspondence."
1,Awful script,"Many of my fellow reviewers pay close attention to the message of love in the film. That's a good thing, but there are many better films out there that are about Christian values without relying on an awful script. Once you've caught the idea that Joshua is guess who, watching the movie fills you with dread as to how the film makers are going to exploit this awful and cynical idea for the sake of Christian values. I guess that's my main complaint: it's a film that cynically uses its premise to sell itself and its movieland version of religion and love."
2,Read the book,"Having read the book twice (quickly once for an assignment in high school and then years later and a lot slower), and having seen the movie too, I would have to say that you should read the book ""Joshua: A Parable for Today."" The book details a lot more and this movie quite frankly left me wanting. Don't bother with your time and money, just buy the book. It was much more fulfilling. If you do buy the book, read it with an open mind and an open heart."
3,joshua,"very enjoyable movie, makes you really think about what would happen if Jesus returned and how the church now would except him."
4,Great Knife Block,"I got this knife block to store all my knives instead of putting them into a drawer. I really like how many slots it has and all my knives fit, I have everything from steak knives to bread cutters to cheese knives in it. It looks really clean on the outside and I like the little logo guy. My only complaint is that the inside slits (where you slide the knives into) weren't sanded down at all and had a lot of wood dust / shavings in there. I also think its worth noting that if you have a really long knife, there is no ""bottom"" to this block so the knife will go through and hit whatever is beneath it."
1,Where do I start..,"I ordered 2 of these $99.00 reg lamps on clearance for $19 each..Woww what a deal.. So you would think..These are more like dollar store quality..Shade ribs don't match..one lamp has plug to the back ,the other to the side..one has antique on it..the other they run out of stain.. light lamp..doesn't take reg light bulbs.. these are priced now @$45.00..THUD..Save your money."
3,huh?,"i watched the bbc television production of this play and my only reaction was, huh? it seemed to be over before it began, and yet, nothing seemed to happen. there's a silly love story, with some pretty lines. and a revenge story, with some angry lines. and some fairies, and some magic. but??? oh, there's some old guy named prospero who settles some old scores and marries off his only daughter. i guess this was the point of the play: how a guy fades in to the twilight of life. i better read the play to see if i missed anything."
4,question?,"I recieved an e-mail from switzerland, the address was cielia@online.ch that was not acceptable to the computer. What's missing?"
1,If I could give it a minus 5 stars I would,For someone who brags that they love their dogs so much I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw what this person is doing to her own dogs-- let alone trying to get other people to do the same. People food prepared as she has it is not necessarily good for dogs. Onions (raw or cooked) are toxic to dogs. Eating them is as serious as Chocolate. Grains of any kind are note easily digestable for our canine friends. Dogs are carnivorous not omnivorous. They do a lot better with raw meat then they do with dead cooked meat. What is a natural diet for a human is NOT a natural diet for dogs!..
1,lame book,no very helpful way outdated it is more about theory than practice would love to see this book swallowed up by a book with more technical info and some good diagrams
2,"Interesting book, not appropriate for executives","While the content in this book is fine and reasonable, I found most of it simplistic and not applicable for people looking for executive jobs. It includes helpful hints like ""you'll need to set up a home office for your job search,"" ""make sure your kids answer the phone in a professional manner,"" and ""don't stop paying your bills--it will mess up your credit."" There are stories of people who changed professions mid-career, with examples being a building contractor who became a doctor; a banker who became a website developer and a woodworker who became a biomedical engineer.Fascinating reading, but what does this have to do with executive job searching? Not much."
3,Good but now leaks.,I have used this for almost a year and it now leaks around the frother. It is easy to clean and I have only one other complaint about the slight difficulty getting the coffee holder seated.
4,Good lamp,"The only drawback about this lamp is the short neck. It is only about 6 inches. Otherwise, the light covers a large area and it is quite sufficient for a small room. Unfortunately the edge of my window ledge is not deep enought for the clamp to stay on with the neck bent. So, I simply sit the lamp on the ledge itself, which is plenty for the lamp to stay steady even with the neck bent. It also comes with an energy efficient bulb."
3,No reviews of this Blu ray,"Having seen the DVD, I can say this is overall a worthwhile production. Having not yet seen the Blu-ray, I am in the company of EVERYONE posting here. The star rating box above says 25 reviews. This is false. There are NO reviews of this Blu ray product here."
1,BEWARE! The DVDs are just as good as the bluray,"This is a review of the BLURAY. This appears to be an upscale of the standard def video to bluray. It doesn't look like hidef, and there are video glitches and artifacts in the picture. The 5:1 sound appears to be a simple process of the stereo track on the DVD with almost no rear channel info. If you already have the DVD set, YOU DON'T NEED THIS BLURAY. Kultur should be ashamed of foisting off a ripoff like this. I want my money back."
5,Amazing Teacher,This man is a one-of-a-kind teacher. He makes me want to be the best teacher I can be. Great incite into the heart of a real and caring professional.
3,"Review of ""Teach Like Your Hair's on Fire""","It is quite obvious that Rafe Esquith is an exceptional teacher who devotes incredible amounts of time to his students and I thoroughly enjoyed reading his antedotes. Rafe teaches in a poverty stricken school where English is not the primary language used at home and I applaud his accomplishments. However, I was a little disappointed. I was led to believe that any teacher could come away from the reading of this book with wonderful and practical ideas for the classroom and, if I were still an elementary teacher, I probably would have. I teach high school now and was disappointed. I know Rafe must have to do a lot to motivate his students, but it is still much easier to motivate a 5th grader than it is a teenager! As a high school teacher, I found there was little practical information I could use."
4,To Teach (DAY AND NIGHT) Or Not To Teach(DAY AND NIGHT)? That is the question,"I was required to read Rafe's book for an Educational Psychology Class. This book was an easy read, and very enjoyable. Rafe offers many valuable teaching tips and packs learning into every minute of his student's days. I thought that providing the students with jobs and making them pay rent for their seats in the classroom was a great idea! He needs to be commended for all the wonderful things he has accomplished throughout his career. I only have one problem with this book, I wonder why he spends so much time with his students, and very little time with his family...I guess this would explain why he is on wife #2. I would reccommend this book to anyone who is teaching or will be teaching, there are so many things to take away from this book, without putting in the overwhelming hours that Mr. Rafe does."
4,Very Readable...,"I really like Rafe's style of writing. He's clearly a devoted teacher, and I don't think any teacher should try to copy everything another teacher does, but there are a few good ideas in this book that are certainly borrowable."
3,Fun but cheap,"This is my first harmonica, and I was so excited upon receiving it! It sounds really nice when played and I had a lot of fun learning. However, only after about a half hour total of playing, the draw on hole 3 already stopped working, and I never played even remotely loudly; I live in a dorm and I was doing my best not to bother others.So, not ideal if you want your harmonica to last, but I can still learn to play on a harmonica with a note missing, then I'll buy a better one, so I'm happy for now."
1,Don't buy Pinnacle Studio Plus Version 11,"Don't buy this product. It is the worst product I have ever brought. It won't let you burn to DVD after having problems getting it to install. You call Tech Support for assistance and you get suggestions on what the problem may be but no one knows and the problem is still not resolved. I have used Pinnacle Studios before and had great results but decided to upgrade to the new version thinking it would have more features. No bad mistake, paid $129.00 for the item mailed in my rebate and never received it. They want you to mail the rebate info in whether you have received the item or not. They don't allow for time waiting to received the product when you order it and the item takes 2 weeks to get to your house. Now add that to the problems you have trying to get it installed and then editing a project only to find it won't burn to DVD. Please do not waste your money. If you want a good editing program buy Power Direct V6 much better. Recommended highly."
3,"A mixed bag --- some good, some less so...","One of the other reviewers called this book excrement, and I suppose I would agree that a couple of the stories within were bad enough to merit that designation. But there were also some pearls among the swine! Another reviewer noted the story about the woman seeking out her former babysitter --- yes, I read that one, too, and it was incredibly arousing! If all the stories in this book were as hot as that one it would certainly be worthy of five stars! I found at least two stories that I'd put in that category.One of the problems with these story compilations about ""tough dykes"" is that all too often they lose any aspect of fantasy by ridding themselves of all pretty, feminine women, instead making the protagonists all butch and mannish. This was most obvious in the prison rape story. It could at least have been erotic in a kinky way, but it ended up just overly-violent and boring."
5,For the beginner and intermediate money fool,"If you're looking for advice on how to make a killing on Wall Street, this book is NOT for you! Read Motley Fools instead.If, however, you are a typical John/Jane Doe trying to make ends meet, buy a house, maybe begin investing, AND figure out how much insurance you need, then this is your BIBLE. Those reviewers who have panned this book are the Wall Street investment types. Don't let them discourage you from buying this wonderful reference for ""the rest of us"".An excellent and entertaining book."
5,Making the Most of Your Money by Quinn,"This book is excellent for providing quality advice on financial and investment matters. The author discusses the details ofasset allocation, portfolio risk management, the optimalinvestment mix, sources of money for college, home-buying,investments in stocks and the optimum yearly savings .The mechanics of charitable trusts are explained, as well asliving wills and estates. The author provides researchsources to obtain minimum rates on credit cards and loans.Strategies to reduce health care and insurance costs are set forth, as well as prudent use of the co-pay to reducemonthly premium rates.The work is a goldmine for consumers willing to read and implement the advice provided. This work is well-researchedby the author. It is a good value for the price charged."
1,Very underwhelming,"EVEN though this text is over 1,000 pages and even though it has suddenly zoomedrom a respectable and credible ranking of 55,000 to the top 200. And even though consumers report picked this over Suze Ormans The Road to Wealth, the fact is that this book is very underwhelming and outdated.It is an easy read. I read it in one day, but felt cheated because I had to consult other sources for more accurateand current information. And let's put to rest that their is an ""organized conspiracy by insuance people against Quinn. The advice by Quinn is the life insurance salemsmens dream; if you follow her advice, you will make your insurance man very rich.As for the five star reviews, ifyou haven't guessed by now, they are all written by the same JBQ shill despite different supposed locations. That should tell you a thing or two about the quality behind this book.Quinn better than Orman? Not by intelligent people! BUY A DIFFERENT BOOK and disregard that JBQ shill."
1,Don't try this at home folks!,"It took 3 years and sorting through numerous financial planners to overcome the mistakes i.e. advice offered by Quinn. At one time, Quinn was the #2 financial author. Well we all know what #2 stands for don't we?The advice in this book smells. Don't try it, you'll be sorry.Everybodies Money Book and Millionaire Next Door are good reads.Quinn is joke. Leave this book on the bookstores shelf where it belongs."
2,Does Quinn ever research anything?,"I noticed that Quinn has an interesting opinion about franchises;only 1/3 succeed? Really? I believe Quinn is confused and means that typical, non franchise businesses have about a 80% failure rate. Ask anyone who has bought into a good solid franchise system how they are doing. Quinn is clueless.I also found a lot of mistakes in her book. Let this one alone. It is loaded with bad advice and misinformation"
1,Don't waste your money on this,"Way too much misinformation. This book will cost you, not make you money.I would recommend Personal Finance for Dummies or Suze Orman's Real Wealth and other books for personal finance information.For wealth building, I highly recommend Cashing in on CASH FLOW by Laurence Pino and Multiple Streams of Income by Robert G. Allen.Anthony Robbins has an excellent seminar called ""Personal Financial Power"" that is a little expensive, but very effective.If you really want tol learn about money, go to people with self earned wealth like PINO, ALLEN and ROBBINS. Forget Quinn. Her syndicated newspaper column was cancelled because nobody listens to her anymore."
4,Good For Its Time,Many of the negative reviews cite the books publication date. That date is no secret. I bought this book just after it came out and it was the main source of my financial education. The internet was not the force it is now where advice (good and bad) is a click away. I achieved what I would consider to be financial success and independence and this book was a great aid in that quest. I do agree that I would not now buy it again (unless an updated version appears) but it still has solid basic advice.
2,Deserving of the Golden Turkey Award for,being the worst financial product ever developed and if because the poor customers who waste their hard earned money on this will become Turkeys.
1,Don''t listen to Quinns sponsors and friends-not 5 star,"This book is undeserving of five stars. One star is a gift. Ignore Quinns sponsors, friends and relatives. Ask anyone with financial smarts what they really think of Quinn.Her newspaper column was cancelled due to low ratings and generic, redundant advice.Do yourself a favor and skip this book. I sold mine at a flea market.Recommend Suze Orman and Ric Edelman though."
1,"I think I'd like Kyle, but the book has little substance","I read the first 70 pages of this book waiting to hit the substance that was surely being built toward with all of the stories, but I never came to it. Judging by his stories and his obvious love for some classics in the movie world, I think I'd love hanging out with the guy...but the book really didn't have much to it. Story after story of his life and experiences, but I was left disappointed coming up empty handed as I sought to find some guidance in prayer.I love his approach and agree that we don't need a formula. He wrote that the formulas and such (like ACTS) are like training wheels that we eventually need to ride free of, and I agree. I don't think we can approach God that way. But 70 pages into a book without anything more than a few good points is not what I was looking for, nor does it fulfill the title of the book."
1,"This book doesn't help you ""understand"" prayer at all","No, all it achieves is rambling on chapter after chapter leaving you more clueless than when you started. I read over half the book and, after getting nothing out of it, I got rid of it. Oh and it's boring too."
2,Average,"You get what you pay for, and 20 dollars for a burr grinder is a 20 dollar burr grinder. First off, let it be known that this IS NOT an espresso grinder AT ALL. 2nd, its messy, the static is just annoying; after you grind the coffee, you practically have to slam the ground hopper on the counter 5 times for some coffee to fall off the walls. and Third, Coffee is starting to fly out of the sides...I would recommend you buy a more expensive machine to be content with your purchase"
2,Smokin' & Chokin',"For the few months that it lasted, the grind was acceptable (except for the fine dust that was always there regardless of the grind setting). I never ground more than the minimum ""4-cup"" setting.Then I was asked by a friend to grind a pound of beans that were inadvertently purchased whole. I filled the hopper and set it for the maximum run time and that was it. Unit started to run slower and slower, with acrid smoke spewing from the motor just before it quit cold.Obviously there is an inherent problem with the design. Look at all the other reports of motor failure."
4,My coffee mill,"I ordered the Melitta MEBG8B and followed the adjustment suggested by 'R. Johnson (Illinois, USA)' and I'm totally satified with the grinder. Thank you Mr R. Johnson."
1,"I'm cheap, what can I say?",I bought this grinder on sale at a kitchen outlet store for $19.99. 'Know what you get for $19.99? A $19.99 burr grinder! 'Nough said!
1,Inexpensive for a reason,"This grinder is a great example of ""you get what you pay for"". It has a nice style and it's small size makes it fit right in on the countertop and that's where the positives end. Being mostly plastic, I knew there was going to be a static problem, I was willing to live with that for the price. There is very little difference between the course and fine grinds.. so much for making espresso AND french press. In the drip even the finest setting produces coffee chunks so large as to waste about 30% of your coffee. I would suggest not wasting your money, no matter how cheap you find it, it's not worth it."
1,Ground coffee is abrasive,"After about 6 months of once daily use the grounds finally wore a hole in the side of the chute that delivers the coffee to the hopper. This resulted in the motor housing filling up with ground coffee, and eventually the whole machine seizing up."
1,What a dissappointing experience!!!,"I purchased the Melitta Mill in April, it's now July and the thing is shot. We used it daily to grind 2 tablespoons of coffee, first the switches stuck and then we had to plug and unplug it to run the thing. Sure it was inexpensive, but you should get more than three months out of the purchase. $6+ a month just to grind coffee? Don't buy this poorly constructed product."
1,Buy a DIFFERENT Grinder,"At first we loved the convenience of this grinder. Then grinds started pouring out the back (from the hole for the electrical cord) all over the counter. When we opened it up to inspect, we saw how badly it is designed. Grinds were all over the electrical wires and every nook and cranny. There doesn't appear to be any damage...it is just constructed poorly and can't be fixed. Now it is in the garbage and we're looking for another one (a different brand this time)."
1,Bad Design,"This grinder has a fragile plastic holder for the grounds. And now that it has cracked, it shoots grinds everywhere. It clogs with French Roast. It grinds everything in large chunks. Bottom line; stay away!On the up side, it looks nice if you don't actually use it."
2,makes a mess,"I used this grinder for quite a while and it works well enough. However, it is very messy to clean and the front control buttons are easy to hit accidentally. For example; when you are removing the front chamber to empty the grounds, you would naturally grip around the middle of the unit and that's exactly where the control buttons are. It feels clumsy to hold on to the top just so you don't start coffee shooting all over the place (yes, I am embarrassed to say this had happened to myself and my mother-in-law when she tried to make coffee for us). I am now using a different grinder with a storage hopper but based on the reviews on the Capresso burr grinders I am ready to try one of theirs."
2,Spend more money on a better grinder,"This is a good little product, but you get what you pay for.The grounds from this grinder are not consistent in size. I did get some that were decent, but after brewing, I could see larger chunks after the smaller grounds settled to the bottom of the filter.I bit the bullet and bought a $90 Capresso Infinity 560 Grinder, and THAT is worth the money. For the same strength, I can use about 20% less beans (which I roast myself). So maybe I'm even saving money.Grinders NEED to produce consistent grounds... and unfortunately this Melitta did not. Either stay w/ the blade grinder... or go w/ a better one (more $$)."
1,stay away,"Stumbled here looking for a replacement for this. The outlet clogs, the buttons are intermittant, you need to shake it constantly to keep the beans feeding, and you can't use the thing without making a huge mess. You do not want one of these."
1,Date with a local landfill,"It is just amazing a company could sell such a worthless, poorly engineered device.I literally can not list one single merit concerning this grinder.Not one.Ditto on every other complaint in the 50 previous reviews,except the motor did not burn up, cause I never use it any more.See my review on the mr coffee mxp3 mill.A fantastic unit for only 30 dollars, you will be much happier with this one."
4,Cheap and gets the job done,"I purchased this grinder because it was easily modified to grind coffee very fine. Thanks to R.Johnson's review I was able to do it very easily. It's almost like it was made to be adjusted. I don't know why 'Linda' says that it makes very large grounds. If adjusted, it will produce fine powder! It does need to be cleaned once a week if you are making fine grindings. I gave it a four only because grounds find their way everywhere in and around this thing. for some reason it cannot keep all the grounds in the grinding chamber or in the clear plastic recepticle. I always end up with a fine dusting of grounds everywhere. The lid could fit better too. With all that said, I am still very pleased. It was inexpensive, very easy to adjust, and makes very even grounds."
3,Cheap but not durable,"I actually did not have the same problems with the ability to grind finely but i did have many problems with the durability of the cup that holds the grinds. After a few months of using it, the corners started to break and then the top. Now, I can barely use without grounds spraying all over the place. However, i have been using it for over a year now so the price may be right if you can give it some TLC during its life. As for the fine grains of coffee, my grinder actually cut so finely that it clogged the opening to the cup. it was as fine as a powder that almost went through my metal filter! I was very pleased from that aspect."
4,Get what you pay for,"This coffee mill has good value for the money, but when I tried to grind fine for espresso, it did not quite do the job right. So, I dump the ground coffee back and grind it again. I might adjust the burrs so that they are a little closer.Updated 3/16/06: I adjusted the burrs as suggested in one of the reviews, and it grinds terrific now."
4,Citadel to City-State,"Definitely not light reading for anyone but those with a fair background in Greek history and archaeology. The book is, however, quite thorough and uses an interesting approach to the subjects of political and social development in the early Greek world, focusing on the archaeology of specific type sites. Since much of what emerged during this critical period in European history has an impact still felt, however unconsciously, on modern society, the book is an important one. It might even be useful as part of a syllabus for selected courses in political science."
3,Not as good as Ghost can do!,"Not that the disc is bad when you compare it to most of hip hop on the Billboard these days but when you out it up to what you expect from a Ghost album it's just that hot. It does have some fly tracks ie. ""Forth Chamber"" ""One Blood"" but killa tracks like ""Holla"" are less than decent, so judge for yourself but don't just pickup the album for the expected Ghost brilliance for that break out ""the Pretty Toney Album"", ""Fishscale"", or "" Supreme Clientele""."
2,Too small!,"I think this might be good for a small person, or a child. The keys are too small and close together. I'm always hitting two keys at the same time, and have to go back and delete. I'm noticing my hand is cramping from use, I never used to have that problem. Like others have said, some of the keys are in positions other than the positions that most keyboards use. I guess you would get used to it after a while, but it's annoying at this point."
5,Gets the job done.,"This is a simple keyboard at a great price. When you want a no nonesense keyboard, this one is it."
2,rieker women's dana 62 slip on shoe,I ordered a size 8 which is my usual shoe size and the shoes were too small. This style/brand of shoes must run smaller than standard. Sent it back for refund. Didn't trust purchasing a larger size.
5,awesome,Bile is one of my favorite industrial acts because have have a raw distorted sound that I really like and when I saw that they made a cover album I knew that it would be good so I got it and guess what it is good. They didn't just play the songs to sound like the original like some other bands do but instead they took these songs and added their distorted industrial sound which made the songs sound fresh and in some cases better than the original like 'They got the beat' and 'Love stinks'. My only complaint is that there are only 9 songs because the cd is over before you know it and I would loved to have heard them transform some other pop songs but for the price you can't really complain.If you like Bile or industrial metal then you should get this cd because you will love it no question about it and tell them that you heard it from me for a 10% discount.
5,Silver Carriage House watch,I have the same Carriage House watch with a two tone band. I wanted a silver one and this one is perfect. I have a very small wrist and it fits perfectly. Someone with a larger wrist would probably find it to be tight. Carriage House watches have worked very well for me. I have owned several over the years.
5,Batman Beyond-Season One.......,"Batman Beyond was created by The WB Television Network to continue the Batman Legacy. With a total of 52 episodes during its' run on TV and a direct-to-video film, it was put on hiatus for the new Justice League animated show to debut but has never been picked back up by WB. I, personally, had to warm up to the series a little before getting this collection. It features the first 13 episodes out of the 52 and has the futuristic Batman going up against some of the original Batman's foes as well as new ones of his own. Will Friedle, Kevin Conroy, Stockard Channing, and George Takei all provide vocal talent for the show and do an outstanding job. After getting this collection, I plan on getting the remaining seasons. It's a real good show and is a must-have for all Batman fans...although I know some of you will probably pass. You don't know what you're missing.Batman Beyond rocks!!!!!!!"
4,"Not Batman, but good","Batman Beyond is not Batman. So don't expect it. But you'll get some entertaining sci-fi/super-hero combo episodes that have a few characters from the old Batman the Animated Series (a non-paralyzed Batgirl's and Batman's alter-identities Barbara and Bruce are the most notable).The most enjoyable parts of the series are when Bruce Wayne gets into the action. He can't do much, but when he acts, you realize just how much better at Batmanning he was than the new one. And the new Batman knows this and he tries to grow into a better man and better hero with Bruce as his mentor.It's really quite enjoyable.Anyone who likes the Batman story would like this show, but it's geared towards 10-15 year olds."
5,Great Show!,Anyone in to Batman will not be dissappointed in this series. Good stories and wonderful follow up to the Animated series. Good job well done.
3,Finally!,"Not knowing the quality of the DVD's yet, all I can say is, don't dissapoint us! 'Nuf Said."
2,mill is a problem,"The mill over grinds beans. For a ""flat"" filter versus a ""cone"" filter the grind should be on the large side. If you set the mill to the lowest setting the beans are hardly ground at all, on the next setting the beans are ground into dust, i.e. espresso grind.The latch over the mill broke on mine.When this machine finally dies I'll go back to one without the integrated mill."
2,Huge Disappointment,"I researched for a couple weeks and decided a thermal pot with a grinding option was the way to go. We went with the Melitta and have been extremely disappointed. After 1 month, we never use the thing, prefering our little coffee press or our old drip machine (the one we were replacing with this new one). The problem? The coffee is not hot. It is barely warm. The thermal pot doesn't even keep it warm for long. When we do use it, we have to put very hot water in the pot for several minutes before brewing, which helps but doesn't really solve the problem. (And it takes 10 minutes prep time.) I never thought of myself as a ""hot"" coffee guy but this stuff doesn't even come close, even if I pour the cup 1 minute after it is done brewing. Other than that, the mill works fine, it seems well made, and looks cool on the counter. It is a pain to clean but we don't have that problem anymore; we hate using it."
1,weak lukewarm coffee and breaks easily,"This coffeemaker is a great idea, but Melitta needs to go back to the drawing board.The coffee is lukewarm at best and if you like medium or strong coffee stay away from this coffeemaker. When you fill up the grinder to the recommended level, it will make 8 cups of paper thin warm coffee. Within 2 months of purchase the tiny PLASTIC piece that holds the lid shut broke. (The coffee-maker won't work unless it is latched closed). I got a replacement lid (6 week wait) and 2 months later and it broke again. I do not abuse my coffeemakers . I had my last carafe coffee-maker 7+ years.After advising me to take it apart and look for problems, Salton (who makes this product for Melitta) offered to replace it (not so willingly, and if I sent back everything with receipt and the original box). I wouldn't want another one.... This expensive purchase is headed for the trash can. My recommendation is to keep your receipt if you buy this."
2,Warm and plastic.,I was very disappointed with this product. The coffee does not brew hot and definitely does not stay warm for any length of time. A bit of a plastic taste to the coffee about every other pot. I returned the unit after a 2 week trial.
1,useless!!!!!,"I bought this product to try and clean my cookie sheets, cake pans, etc. that get tarnish or film from the dishwasher...product did not work at all!!! I won't even rate this 1 star!"
3,Decent keyboard,"Decent keyboard. Great for beginning pianists. A few things:*The sound - the keyboard's lowest sound is quite loud. The keys sound cheap, especially the high ones. The biggest problem is that headphones can be used, but they only amplify the sound; sound still generates through the keyboard speakers and not just the headphones, so there is no way to play quietly.*The keys - they are a little smaller than most keyboards.*The music stand - the music slides off of the keyboard stand easily."
3,Price Check Please,"I have ordered this before, and placed the order quickly, the price was $9 something, as it is today, however when I went back to check on the order, I actually paid $24 (something) for it. Double check the price before you buy."
3,Be forewarned,"Despite what this site AND the companies own website say, this product is NOT compatible with Windows XP. Their tech support guy is nice, but helpless with an issue that is insoluble. Their customer service just said, ""sorry, return it to Amazon and maybe try another one of our titles."" No offer to exchange for a working title, as they were worried about throwing off inventory."
4,"Small, simple watch","I just needed a simple watch to wear daily. It works fine, but the strap is rather small and flimsy. It's a basic watch that does what I need."
3,"OK, but strap didn't last","I liked that this watch was small, not too formal, and not too casual. I wore it probably an average of 3 days a week for a little over a year before the leather strap broke at the spot where I usually had it closed. I moved to the next hole over, and that part of the strap broke a few days later."
2,Unfulfilled potential,"I bought this book because of its description as the story of a woman who, at 50, received her doctorate and became a Holocaust scholar. Instead it is a sledgehammer of a book filled with amazing details that are a encomium to her late husband. Very disappointing, as she obviously has a lot to offer in her own right, but hardly discusses her own thoughts and motivations with any depth. Filled with details (page upon page about household management but less than ten pages regarding her own graduate curriculum) that detract rather than lend substance to her story. I hope she reflects in print sometime her own considerable development as a scholar. An index would have helped pull some of the disparate pieces together."
5,"Brilliantly detailed, utterly absorbing","This was my first foray into the work of Michael Moorcock, and he doesn't disappoint. The vision and storytelling demonstrated in this series suggests Russian writers of an earlier age. I thoroughly enjoyed this."
5,Culture Counts Too!,"This book is more than an important slice of western railroad history: it is an insider's view of a company that has consistently and successfully dealt with the assimilation of competing, and in some cases conflicting, corporate cultures. In this respect alone it serves as an important contribution to the field of railway management, a subject that has received far less coverage than railway history.Henry Posner IIIChairmanRailroad Development Corp.Pittsburgh, PA"
1,Not as I expected,"No color preview when I selected the color and came with the wrong color, really confuse the people"
5,train,great addition to the polar express train i bought for under out tree all the family loved the train and how it looked like the movie
4,Uhuru: A Super Read!,"For anyone wishing to develop any understanding of Africa and its people, this book is a must read. While perhaps not the best of Ruark's books; it certainly is a close contender for the titlr."
4,Poignant,"This story is so sweet it stays with you. There is no doubt of love in this story - on Jake's side. He makes the entire book. I wanted more from Rebecca at the end so I would feel she was worthy of all of Jake's devotion, but I would still recommend this book."
4,"Good wipers, great value.","For the price, these wipers cannot be beat. They offer a clean wipe and install easily. I have had a pair on my wife's car for 10 months, including the winter, and they still work well. Occasionally they have been a little noisy, but wiping them off with glass cleaner every so often seems to prolong their life."
2,Anco 24 inch Wiper Blade for 1995 C Class Mercedes,Don't really like the design...wipes windshield in middle pretty good but misses the lower 3 inches on both sides (total of 6 inches) where the windshield curves. Factory wiper is much better designed and wipes entire windshield.
2,Last...and LEAST!,"I love Columbo, and have every DVD of every season and all the movie collections. Up until this last one, they were well-written and acted with great plot lines. I guess they ran out of ideas AND good guest stars. Maybe one or two of this last collection was good, but the rest should have been laid to rest! Goodbye Peter Falk, we still love you!"
5,Great episodes,"This package contains seven full-length episodes, which are truly fantastic. As Peter Falk aged, his Columbo became more appealing. He really grew into his character, displaying a delightful, folksy wisdom and curious innocence that make him even more charming now than he was when the series started."
2,Lasted just a year and half,"I ordered this unit in February of 2010. The Epson photoconductor is pricey at $237, considering that one can get a brand new printer with similar to Epson AcuLaser functions for not much more.However, the printer itself has been very reliable for many years and I thought the new photoconductor will be an easy solution to the problem.Well, today (October 2011) the photoconductor died. Just in the middle of working on all bunch of stuff, I got a ""Photoconductor error"". I am extremely disappointed, due to the fact that the original one has lasted for at least couple of years more and as such, I didn't expect the photoconductor replacement to become useless so soon.Buyers BEWARE!I, personally, will look at buying the new printer next."
2,"Okay if you skip the gay, or if you are gay to start with, bet that helps","This just wasnt very good.Might be my fault for not finding out more about the editor - a gay guy - but from the title of the book, I didnt expect so many gay guy stories. I dont judge other folks lifestyles, but I m not interested in reading about gay guys. If I was, I might have bought a book that indicated it was heavy on gay men. This books title sure didnt mention homo in the title anywhere, and there were some straight stories, a few of them quite good.But all in all this was more a reflection of the editors taste in homo-erotica, and a very misleadinng title."
2,Obsessed,Short story I couldn't finish this book as anxious as I was to read it. To me the author was obsessed with the crows to the point it seemed as though it was all she could think about (they all had first names and/or family names) and it slowly began to grate on my nerves.
1,VP Wierwille has been established as a Cult Leader,"Steve Hassan, and others have written extensively on VP Wierwille. The Way Ministry and Biblical Research Institute (aka) The Way International is not an organization to become involved in. Please do an extensive web-search before trying to purchase any of these books. The glowing reviews here are not what they seem. These reviews are entered by members of this cult, knowing that you can not get these books but are ready to recruit!!!!"
5,"An honest, transparent account","I sense that Mr. Conant is a man of integrity. His account honestly exposes his own contributions to the downfall of his marriage. I appreciate the sensitive way he refuses to overemphasize the faults of his former wife. It isn't difficult to ""read between the lines"" and sense that she was a troubled, needy individual. However, Mr. Conant obviously is more concerned with paying attention to what he has personally learned and the coping skills he has consequently developed than he is with laying blame. The insights he shares at the end of the book reflect a wisdom and maturity that is uncharacteristic for someone so young. An excellent read"
3,I prefer his fiction,"This book is the first in a series. Frankly, I hope that in his next memoir there iwll be more about his literary writing b/c this doesn't cover his marvelous literary career at all.The first sections of the book which deal with his childhood and schooling are comic and moving, with great turns of phrase and details about his grandfather and large family. What I found less interesting were the accounts of his journalism career. Apart from a very compelling section about a political asassination and its aftermath, I was a little bored. Even worse, I did not feel that some of his bohemian friends were distinguished from each other.I am going to go back and reread The General in His Labyrinth and the novels that I so adore. I just prefer them."
4,Calphalon Everyday Pan,"I have several pieces I have purchased through Amazon at great prices. Just love the product and this one is really an ""everyday"" pan."
3,just say no to nonstick,the features of this pan are a bit misleading. it is not possible to braise or saute in a nonstick pan. with any sort of nonstick coating you cannot brown anything. the best you can do with nonstick is boil. i can understand a nonstick omlet pan but if you're going to be doing any kind of serious cooking you will want a tradional surface. calphalon is smooth and non-porous that its still and easy clean up and as an added bonus you don't have to worry about damaging the surface.
4,"Great quality, too small",I have a number of the commercial nonstick pans. If you're patient you can assemble a good set when the individual pans become discounted. This pan is the same as the rest - great quality and great looks. It cooks and cleans easily. My only complaint is that it is too small to be used very often. I have the larger version as well and I use it all the time.
2,Disappointed,"Not impressed at all. Although it is under lifetime warranty, the pan is not nonstick anymore after 1.5 years with once per week usage."
4,It's Pok√©rific!,"This book is excellent. It has great pictures and lots of information about 150 different Pok√©mon, the pronunciation key is great and this is a must for any Pok√©maniac."
1,This should be sold at a dollar store,"this is a total piece of trash,it's nothing like the picture,there's no adjustable fingers or wrist strap and the glove is made of foam"
1,horrible cheap piece of plastic,"I bought this, thinking it was the glove they showed a photo of on the product page. When I received it, it was a compketely different glove, and the plastic part fell off the faux leather (cheap vinyl/polyester?) when I tried it on. the fingers are barely moveable at all.despite the price it is absolutely misguiding to call this ""deluxe"" in any way or fashion."
3,"Not quite what I thought, but good","It's not as gypsy as I thought it should have been and it skips when playing in the car, but it's not bad overall. Couldn't beat the price either."
3,Not quite the right fit,"I've ordered this brand from Amazon for my Odyssey and they worked perfectly. When I installed these lift supports for my '94 Accord LX, the trunk would not close without slamming it down. The product works, but sizing is off due to the need to slam it to get it to latch."
2,Some suspect beliefs,"Having cancer myself I found one part of this book incredibly insensitive.They believe cancer is caused by a demon and that it is incurable by doctors and if they attempt to cut it out then the demon will make the cancer appear somewhere else. The only solution is to cast the demon out.OK so explain why my mother had cancer in her 30's and is now 74 and fine?How my friend had cancer in his 20's and now in his 40's is fit and healthy?This is saying no-one can ever be free of cancer unless the spirit is cast out.Almost everyone on earth has some cancer cells in their body, the issue arises when they get out of hand.Are they saying everyone has the demon of cancer?Absolute poppycock.The book was OK, was going to give it 3 stars but for the reason above I'm giving it 2 stars."
1,Fun till it crashed,"I'm not a rookie gamer and this is the first time I bought a game and regretted it. Classic old-school RPG fun until it starts crashing on you. I'm a tech for a living and can fix most bugs or problems, but you just can't fix garbage. Don't waste your $."
1,~BRONSON~ AT HIS WORST!,"Without a doubt the worst ""B"" movie made and damn sure NOT worth $13.98!!The only reason Jill Ireland (this was her worst) ever got in any movies is because she was married to Charles Bronson, and her small part was pitiful. Charles was not his best in this one but you have to remember this was made in 69', and the fight's well it's bad to! This is a 2 hr. waste of DVD, but if you want it go for it!"
5,Never had a single problem with the RCA D52130,"I was surprised at the others' comments. I've had my RCA for almost 3years and I've never experienced a single problem with my TV. Color and quality are exceptional. Not one problem with powering up, display or sound. As far as customer service goes, I have no experience. But, I've taken care of my product and I'm sure not to abuse it and I'm completely satisfied with my purchase. It's unfortunate to hear everyone else's stories."
2,there's a better stylus out there,"The Panache stylus may look good but it has 2 problems: 1) It rolls off the table. 2) It sticks out way too much.There's a much better stylus out there from Pentopia: the Chameleon Visor stylus - T11FV This is made especially for the Visor. I can't believe that Amazon and many other places aren't even selling this one. It is really nice. It has a reset pin plus a pen inside. The tip is EXACTLY like the one from PDA Panache, but the design of the stylus is a lot better.Advantages: 1) It does not stick out. 2) It has the ridges at the end (just like the original stylus that comes with the visor) so it is easy to remove from your handheld. 3) Because it is wedge-shaped like the original visor stylus at the upper end, it won't roll off the table. 4) It is very light. 5) the cost is the same..."
1,"Not sure about the review that said, ""this is no toy, its the real deal"" ?!!","This is a VERY cheap,ligtweight,piece of plastic. Living in New Orleans, kids catch this quality of toy off of Mardi Gras floats all day long."
1,disappointed,"A very disappointing offering from what I would usually consider very talented authors. Stories are uninteresting, choppy, and failed to hold my attention. Didn't finish the first, and the next two were so poor I don't have the energy to attempt the final story. Male leads are weak and unappealing, females are ditzy and unbelievable characters. Plots are sketchy and full of holes, bounce around and major character traits and plot lines are introduced at the very end of the story...were these edited down from full length novels?This read is kinda like spotting a supermodel on the beach, then realizing they are wearing an ugly, unflattering full body sweatsuit.Mysteria did not live up to my expectations."
5,A Self help book worth reading,"I seen W. Clement Stone referenced in other motivational books by Zig Ziglar, Earl Nightingale etc, but had never read any of his writings. I have found The Success System That Never Fails to be inspirational and very enjoyable reading. Mr. Stone wrote in a very conversational manner and consistently urges readers to put the ideas gleaned from his writings into action and do it now. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in trying to get the most out of life."
2,I couldn't get through it,"First, text shouldn't be centered for general reading. Second, it seemed like the author was talking in circles and couldn't get the points across. Just a book full of fluff... not helpful at all."
3,The Richest Man in Babylon,"It's a good book, but I mainly wanted the audio-book that came with it. It is a very poor recording, with the narrator seeming as if he thinks he is on a stage and feels the need to project. I felt as if I was being yelled at and was unable to listen to the recording for more than a few minutes."
3,It's okay,"I bought this because I believe in natural healing/health. I don't believe that this helped my family at all in terms of helping us get over a cold faster or whatever. We eat mostly organic, stay away from processed foods, limit sugar and focus on fruits and veggies... this syrup is very sweet and has added sugar to it. For any health product, I think it defeats the purpose of taking a syrup for health if it is going to have added sugar or other ingredients that isn't necessary for its function. Sugar depresses the immune system so in my opinion, I feel that this product is a wash out.. it helps and doesn't help your system all at once. I went with a different brand with NO sugar (or any sweeteners) so we will see how that does instead."
3,My one year old would rate this a 5,"She absolutely LOVES this book and my 3 year old even tries to get a hold of this book. I do not find the artwork appealing - the illustrations are very simplistic - but perhaps this is the quality that appeals to toddlers. It is also a repetitive story - each animal asks if they can go for a ride, each gets in the canoe, until finally with a moose on board it sinks and they all go for a swim. So, your kids may like this book even if you don't."
3,Shiitake cultivation : not for everybody,"This is a well-written book about technical and practical aspects of commercial shiitake growing. If you are seriously considering commercial production of shiitake it is a must-have book.Its subtitle, ""The Art and Science of Mushroom Growing"" is misleading. Far more accurate would be ""The Science and Practice of Commercial Shiitake Production"". Except for a phylogenetic references, it has nothing to say about mushrooms other than shiitake. I had set out to learn enough about mushrooms in general and shiitake in particular to grow a few for friends and family. Unfortunately, the shiitake is native to Southeast Asia and likes a steadily warm humid environment. Based on what I gathered from this book, neither amateur nor commercial shiitake production is practical where I live, so I'm still looking for a good book on small-scale mushroom cultivation in a temperate climate"
3,Very Good but........,I agree with the previous reviewer except on a couple issues. I do not like the way demons are handled. They are made to be very weak against a truly good hearted person. I also think they could have made alot more mundane magic and high powered magicks. THey stuck to the middle gound and fleshed that out very well. There were very few high powered magicks explored.
3,"Tolerable, I Suppose","I will preface this by saying that I am suffering from all-day sickness with my 3rd pregnancy. That said, I could barely stomach the taste of this stuff. Also, it's a bit disappointing that something so chalky and unappetizing would have 40 calories per tablespoon. It just seems that with that much sugar contest it should taste somewhat good. If you want to get 100% of your daily calcium, you have to take 2 Tbsp., so the bottle would only last 2 weeks. I won't be ordering it again."
5,A wonderful place to eat!,"Cross Creek Cookery is a wonderful book full of delicious recipes that really work. Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings wrote about her own life and kitchen where she produced meals for friends from all over the world using food from her own yard. I've served several of her simple dishes to family and friends and relished reading about the others. She wrote the book in response to requests from World War II GI's, who missed the home cooking on their own farms. No need to miss it; you can make it, too."
2,"Terror, Horror ac Parvor",I used to like this when I was twenty years old or so. Now it just sounds cacophonic. If you want optimist theology cast as music I think Mahler's Symphony No. 9 is much better.
5,to musiqstar87,"just a correction about your review. ""guess who's back"" doesn't have mack 10 in it it has beanie sigel"
4,Canon TS-E 45mm Tilt Shift,"Excellent build quality. The photographs it produces are really nice. Certainley does not replace a camera with more movement, but a good addition to my 35mm kit."
1,Awful!,"This book has very cute illustrations, but the story is awful. Shaggy dog asks for help for a horrible itch, and no one will help him without making sure he pays up first. Such a great lesson to teach kids - don't help anyone (even if they are in pain) unless they help you first. Then each person scratches him with various instruments - a shepherd's crook, a fork(?!) and a brush. I wonder how many poor dogs have had a child chase after them with a fork to ""help"" them after reading this book. I'd take this book to a used book store, but it's bad enough that I'll probably just throw it away. The other books I've received by this author are fine, but I stopped reading this one aloud to my daughter after the first couple of pages."
3,"Good, not great reference...","""Facial expressions"" is worth getting if you are looking for how the human face can squash and stretch, and how far you as an artist can push that, while still making the face ""realistic."" I belive many novice artists would be surprised. I was also pleased to see the age range of the subjects photographed. However, this book is not very good if you are seriously studying facial expressions. As another reviewer has said, the expressions in the book are cartoony and over acted. Again, this would be fine if what you are studying is how the features of the face interact, but if you are say, a comic book or storyboard artist who wants to work on acting and drawing a good, meaningful facial expression, this book isn't for you. Also, the drawings inspired by the expressions are pretty useless; honestly, they are in most photo reference books of this type."
4,"Try ""Programming Applications for Microsoft Windows""","I believe ""Programming Applications for Microsoft Windows"" is the fourth edition to this book. The Microsoft Press summary for the new book says ""This fully updated expansion of the bestselling ADVANCED WINDOWS digs even deeper into the advanced features...""Also compare the table of contents between the two books for yourself. I am buying ""Programming Applications"" instead of this book."
1,Not for the serious programmer,"I also feel this book is not the best choice. Too much is left to your 'assumed knowledge', and what is discussed oscillates between too basic and too vague. The chapter on Device I/O especially shows this. I feel it is particularly poorly written."
1,Really NOT a must have,"This is not a book I would recommend as a must have, no, you'd be better off without it."
3,Tackle assortment NOT included,"If you are getting this product simply for a tackle box for a young child, it is pretty good. The ""hinged"" tray is a little difficult, as it the hinges are plastic. Also, please be aware that the 100 piece tackle assortment is NOT included. The company sent me a replacement or two before they called to the warehouse, only to discover that those pieces no longer are included. You get only a hook and two bobbers."
2,Glad I Didn't Pay Full Price for Decorate Rich,"Scan the pages of Decorating Rich for some beautiful photography and interesting ideas. Skip the narrative, as it is labored and dull. It is a good coffee table book that won't make any demand on your brain power, even if you read the text."
1,Rip off version of Ricky Martin Europa,"This is the same concert as ""Ricky Martin: Europa"" without the special features and at 10x the price. It also goes by the name ""Dime Que Me Quieres"" which doesn't even feature the title song. Be suspicous of videos that don't have a region code."
5,Great Lens!,"I got this lens after finding that my 50mm was just too tight indoors. I was always limb chopping my daughter's photos because I had no room to get it all in! This lens is perfect! And super sharp! I have a Canon Rebel T3 (crop). I've done 2 newborn shoots with it and everyone comments how sharp my photos are. I debated for a long time about what lens to get, and I'm really happy that I chose this one. I just wasn't ready to shell out thousands on a 24-70, so this fit the bill nicely!"
2,Not sharp from 2.0 to 3.2 during indoor shots,The files generated with this 35 mm lens were not sharp from 2.0 to 3.2 and relied heavily in the back up of flash in order to render a usable file. Cropping made from the full resolution files rendered images with poor contrast requiring of considerable fine tuning in Lightroom.I would not recommend this lens for professional work.
2,An older lens that needs an update,"I purchased this lens mostly because I shoot a 1.6 crop sensor and the 50mm on that crop is a bit too telephoto for most indoor situations.I didn't have the cash to shell out for the L-series version of this lens, but figured the f/2 would be fast enough for me. It is fast enough when the light is good, but this lens really struggles in low-light situations. It is also very soft until about f/4, effectively making it no more useful than the kit lens that comes with the newer Rebel series cameras at 35mm.Were Canon to update this lens with a f/1.8 and USM, it'd buy it again, but until then, this is pretty much a lens to pass on."
4,A Sweet Little Lens,"While this lens is not perfect, it is lightweight and does a fairly good job. Using it on a Canon 5D, it takes good landscape and architectural images. Its size is amazing in its compactness and lightness. It is fairly sharp from edge to edge and has distance indicators meaning one can set the lens to manual and use it with preset hyperfocal distance. The lens itself is noisy and without USM, it is not as smooth in focusing as a more expensive lens. But for the price, it is highly recommended for those days when carrying a heavier lens just is not an option."
4,down under,"groovies theory - party spots at night. interesting -i used it to explore the better joints in town. sydney is easy to navigate and a very friendly city - so it isnt hard anyway, but the groovy map helped me get to where the best night places are and what to do there. congrats. lookin forward to more versions. what about tahiti?"
1,Simple. No meat. Just a basic guide.,"This book may help someone who has not ever been in sales of any kind. The basic approach to sales is easy to read and understand. Yet, it lacks the back bone a good automotive sales book needs."
5,A superb 9th!!!,The key word with this interpetation is it's simplistic and direct approach. Never has the Berlin ever sounded so integrated. The warmth and lushness of detail never descends into gaudiness...it is sumptous and burnished. If you take the Bruckner 9th serious this is a must have..it makes Barenboim and Harnoncourt sound pedestrian.
2,Graphic is Amateur Quality,"I bought this decal for a kayaking friend and am disappointed in the quality. I really like the concept, but I feel I could have made this on my own computer. Graphic was pixelated and ink was thin. In my opinion, not worth the money and shipping."
5,One of the best real hip hop album of the year.,"The cd itself is amazing. The beats are real good and that makes the cd terrific. #4 Silent just wangs in your home stereo, it makes you want to put it over again. This cd features many valuable songs and is worth buying."
2,wackness,Man i v herd some tigh stuff from this man n this is not it...lyrically this album is ill but the production is not good maen
4,GZA LEGEND,"Very pleased to hear the new work of one of the tightest rappers around, the album seems close to flawless. But it appears to be lacking all expletives, is this just the copy I received here in Australia or is that just the way it is?Apart from the heinous removals which cut harshly into the flow of some songs (although the Gza himself swears very little)this is a top album, the string work on track 2 has great impact and the Gza's wit and intelligence is second to none.After a slew of weak albums over the past few years, GZA's album is a relieving masterpiece."
4,Better beats+a meth track coulda been 1 of best albums ever,"The genius's rhymes are a ten, average producing hurt this album as well as only having 1 video which i can say is boring even though iv'e only seen it twice. That fact that it is boring is probably the reason i've only seen it twice. A colabo with method man would have been perfect for this album even though its not gza's style to use bigger names for album sales. Too bad, no exposure, no meth, o.k. beats, i guess lyrics AREN'T everything."
5,Unbelievable selection,"This company has about 500+ patterns. They absorb like crazy.Very fast service, packed well. The wood holders look great."
5,GREAT!,I REALLLYYYY loved the book i am i Joy division Fan and getting a close looking on how Ian became apart of the band was great!(:
3,Sony NW-E305 Walkman Bean 512 MB MP3 Player,"It is very ,model we can't copy the songs directly to it. We need Audacity software for it. The company do provide CD for the software but it is not working for windows Seven. Only good thing about the product is battery back which was very good."
1,Doesn't convert wma or wav files,"I bought this radio and returned i tthe very next day, why? because they force you to buy all the music from their Connect.com website. I had 50 songs on my windows media player and some songs I bought off walmart.com for .88 NONE were compatible with the MP3. they were in either wma or wav format which it ""says"" it can convert but it never did, it always stayed on 0% when converting, I ended up calling their customer support the next morning and they told me no song that was copywrite protected could be downloaded (even if I paid for it legally on walmart.com) I would have to re-buy all my songs through their site for them to be compatible. I returned it and bought a RCA that is compatible with my windows media player."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!,"I love this lens! If you film, don't fall prey to the 1.8....it's garbage. This is a MUST HAVE. I fell in love with this lens while shooting a commercial for scrapbook dot com and i had to buy it. I haven't taken it off my camera since! Go here to see what we were able to accomplish with this lens... [...] Thank you!!!"
3,it's ok,It's a good lens but limited on capabilities like some other lenses but really good for the $$
4,Really good lens!!,Keep in the mind of the crop factor.When getting this lens for non-full frame cameraFast lens and light
5,Love this lens!!!,"I'm not going to spend a lot of time writing this review, because as you can see there are already many thorough reviews on this lens. I can say that I'm very glad that I spent the extra money on this lens. I did try the 1.8 and felt that this lens had a better build and would last me longer. I didn't want to have to upgrade later because I already know that photography is not just a passing phase for me. It's so fast and works great in low light conditions. My friends are all impressed with the quality of photos that I get with this lens and that's worth it to me!"
3,50 mm 1.4 prime lens,"My two-cents:I gave this lens a 3 only because the clarity/sharpness is really, really good. In fact, if I had to judge in clarity only, it would get a 5+ star review. I was, however, not impressed with the bokeh that photographers/friends went on and on about (to be fair, lens reviews seemed mixed on their opinion of this lens versus the 1.8, but said there was a slight difference in the bokeh)!! I could have saved $200-$250 and gotten the 1.8 and it would have been very close to the same. I have been mad ever since I purchased this lens, because the bokeh isn't much better than the 24mm-105mm macro lens I already have. If you have money to throw around and just HAVE to have a 50mm lens; go for it. If not, get the 1.8 and save your money to add another cool lens to your repetoire."
4,Soft from 1.4-1.8,"This lens is very soft at 1.4. sometimes too soft to shoot. For a medium quality photo, 1.8 or 2.0 will be minimum. This lens performs great at 2.8, as sharp as some L lenses do. Focus of this lens is very fast. I have never got any problem with the speed of focus."
1,Junk,"This lens, the Canon 50mm f1.4 promised to be a really good lens. Well, maybe it is if the AF didn't stop working shortly after I spentalmost $400 to own it. I started noticing that all my images were blurry no matter what my settings were and then I couldn't even findfocus with the MF chosen. I have been shooting with a Canon DSLR (actually had three of them) over the last six years and never had a problem likethis with my other Canon lenses or my Sigma and Tamron lenses. Canon should take this one back to the drawing board. Apparently, I am not alone asI see many others have reviewed this lens here and at the Canon web site and found the failure of the AF system to have happened with their 50mm f1.4 also.Wish I had known about this before buying this lens."
4,Very nice for portraits,"I just received my Canon 50mm in time to use for Christmas. Its really nice to see the impact shallow depth of field can create. As this is my first prime lens, I think it will take some time to adjust to a different way of shooting. It was great is low light, but I'm still having trouble getting crystal clear focus - must be my shaky hands."
2,"Focus issues...already, smh. will update when new unit is recieved.","I actually rented this lens from Adorama for a shoot last week. Was able to take shots at even 1.4 without issue, very few unfocused shots. hit rate was about 95%, and i was very pleased.I ended up purchasing the lens this past tuesday. And while the first couple of shots & bob atkins tests went well, in the field- just regular walkabout tests- the autofocus went from fine to WTF very quickly. I began to wonder if it was my technique, but I do much better on my 85 1.8, which is known to have blazing focus speed/accuracy. But this was just bad. At one point theres 10+ shots with focus off.Reference shots full body/ poses of 2 prospective models ALL came out blurry, even at shot speeds of 1/160. I couldn't believe it- I think the lens has real issues bas 2/3 feet. So im going to go ahead and order this lens from amazon so i will have more than 7 days to evaluate. Current version is being returned to ado. I dont have time for this :("
3,Good!,"This is a great lens. I'm new at photography, so I never really know what lens are good to buy and what isnt. The pictures turn out great. The only down fall about this is that it doesn't get the 'whole' picture unless you back up a little when taking the picture. The lens cuts off a lot of room. My next choice I think i'd try would be the 35mm because it takes more wider angle pictures."
3,not so fast,"I have tried at least four samples of this lens and they all have had the same issue: they are very soft at 1.4. This lens gets much much better as soon as you go to 2.8.Eventually, I bought the Canon 50mm 2.5 macro lens and I can say that this lens is almost as sharp at wide open as it is closed down to the next stop and the remaing stops. I am very happy with this lens. Oh, this lens also costs less than the 50mm 1.4."
5,Very nice lens,This is a great lens. I'm not a professional but I enjoy taken a lot of pictures. I have a Canon 40D that came with a zoom and I needed a faster lens. This was the answer to that. I still think I'm going to need a fast wider angle lens to take pictures in my house. But they are very expensive. I'm going to have to leave with what I have for some time.
4,Great lens,"Bought this lens for the Canon 7d. I've loved it so far. For me, the price and quality represented a good midpoint between the 50mm 1.8 and 1.2 (which I suppose was Canon's goal). The lens is a bit soft at its widest, but I really only use that for extremely low light, and shoot mostly at 4.0 or 4.5 if the light allows, where the lens seems to be sharpest. As this is mounted on my 7d, the focal length is closer to 80mm (78mm to be exact, I think), so it's not exactly wide, but I knew this before purchasing, so no complaints there. Build, for the most part, seems very solid. It's got some heft, and no plasticy feel to it, still would really want to put its durability to any stress test unless necessary though. Overall, it's a great lens. If I had the money, I would of course go top of the line with the ""L"" series lenses, but I don't, so this made for an excellent compromise. Recommended."
5,Great portrait lens,Right out of the box on my EOS XSi this lens was fantastic. I had been looking for a prime lens for shooting portraits and deliberated between the <$100 version or this lens (the L series wasn't practical for my needs). After reading other reviews I decided the f1.4 was worth the additional money. The lens has been incredibly easy to use in very low light all the way through the bright Caribbean beach scenes. The softness of the bokeh has been most impressive and everyone I've photographed has been extremely happy with the results. I'd recommend to everyone to take the jump to this lens rather than the more economical version.
1,I wish I had taken all the one star reviews more seriously,"Yes, this lens definitely has quality issue. On mine, both of the auto focus and the manual focus died in less than a year. I have been taking very good care of it. I am debating with myself if it is worth the trouble to get it fixed, since it appears that the same problem will come back. If I could give it zero star I will."
5,My favorite new lens,"The 50mm 1.8, MKII was wonderful. For the price, you cannot do better. However it was somewhat toy-like and I recently upgraded from an XTi to a 5D so I wanted to to upgrade that lens as well. I'll tell you that there is a difference -- to me it is mainly in the bokeh quality. There is such a thing as the quality of bokeh and this lens' bokeh quality is amazing. It's also very sharp wide open at 1.4 (for me, I've heard people dispute this but I think they're being way overcritical). I was trying to decide between this and the 1.2, and I'm glad I got this. The 1.2 bokeh quality is out of this world, but this one comes damn near close enough for me! It's also light without being toy-like. Highly recommended, this is my new everyday lens"
4,Very sharp and contrasty but strong CA,"I've been using it for about 3 years on cropped sensors of Rebels and 40D. I like this lens. It is very compact, has useful focal length and is capable of beautiful results. However the chromatic aberrations are too strong especially in out-of-focus areas. Canon's standard converters try to hide some of CA but there are substantial limits to this approach. Also this is a problem for users of other raw converters.Finally images taken at below F2.0 are too soft and lack contrast ... so I use F1.4-1.8 only in emergency.Overall the best compact 50mm lens for Canon but I expected more from a normal prime at this price point."
5,Canon EF 50mm f1.4 USM review,"This is a fantastic lens. It's great in low level light and performs excellent in all conditions. The one thing to remember is that since it's a fix focus lens, meaning no zooming capability, then you have to make sure you have enough room to back up in order to get the view you want. I actually won a photo contest with the lens and continue to use it for all my family photos. I even took some photos for a couple of my friend's kid's first birthday and they were quite happy. I'm not a professional, but definitely think it's worth it if you want to be able to take pictures inside without the use of a flash. Highly recommended!"
3,not a concert DVD,"although i enjoy his music, don't expect this DVD to be a concert from him ( like i did ) it is a compilation of some his videos !!me gusta mucho su musica, pero este DVD no es un concierto, solo es una compilaci√≥n de algunos de sus videos."
3,"Took a long time for this rug to ""lay down""","We used this in our sunroom, and it has done it's job. Don't expect this to lay flat for the first month, at least. The look and colors are exactly as they appear in the product photo."
3,Not detailed enough...,"For me this book lacked the information I was seeking. The details were too short. Though the book covered most of the bases of places to go and things to see, the abruptness of what little information there was made me think this book was thrown together and more work could have been put into it. There were no suggested itineraries. I've seen much better books with better recommendations in them. But I've seen worse as well. For the money, this book will get you there. But will you know what to expect after that?"
5,Another wonderful book,"Well this is another book by one of my favorite authors. Connie Mason's books are all keepers! I have read and reread them all several times. I loved the Outlaws series. These brothers are great. This book is about Jess, the Doctor. He is on the run along with his brothers from the law after being falsely accused of robbing a bank. He comes across a female bounty hunter, Meg, who is determined to bring him in. How this story unravels is quite funny and very touching. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone."
1,Let this one fall away....,"The first book I read from Tamara Thorne was Haunted. I enjoyed that book so much, I rushed out and got Moonfall. What a disappointment!!!! Gone was the fast-paced, struggle of good and evil that kept me so glued in Haunted. I found this book boring, lacking the excitement and creepy crawlers that I fully expected. I trudged through this book just waiting for it to be over with, not caring much what happened to the characters and almost cheering for the satanic nuns with garter belts to kill them all! Don't start with this book, go for another one of hers instead!"
1,It went flying...and almost broke my car window out,This wiper broke while driving down the highway and almost broke my windshield out. I have never had this to happen to me before and this could have hurt someone.
4,looks good!,pretty basic...looks like it will do the job well and for $5 who can complain? Nice color and seems to be very good quality
4,Too much of a good thing...,"Don't get me wrong, I love Baxter Black. His poetry is great, and his columns are fun and enjoyable. This book had its moments, too, but is a cluttered, frenetic read that could have used a sterner editor. Pared down, this book could have been a howlingly funny novella, instead of an amusing novel. Call me stuffy and all, but it gets tiring weeding through all of the invented silly names for people peppered throughout. No one in this book has a normal name, and what can be occasionally clever becomes a literary device bordering on tedium. Okay, as a comedy-fantasy this book does work for me, as the scenarios are much too fantastic to even smack of realism, and after awhile I gave up and read it in that light. It works, ignoring the intrusive attempts at cleverness, but for the next one, Baxter, throw in a couple of Jim Bobs and Tammys."
4,He calls 'em as he sees 'em!,"Baxter Black is best known for his cowboy poetry, but in an unique twist of events, Baxter wrote a book on rodeo cowboys. Having ""gone down the road"" myself, this book brought back memories of some pretty crazy times in my life. A must-read for any rodeo fan."
3,HUGE,"i had no idea how large these mugs were going to be. Had i seen them in a store first, i would not have bought them, although i must say they are wearing on me...even if i can almost put my whole face in the mug."
4,A wonderful Amish mystery,"I got this book through Santa Thing on Library thing. My Secret Santa, Joe was great at picking out an Amish book that was also a mystery. I was amazed as I never thought there were any out there.Hannah or better known as Granny Hanny, is the Amish grandmother to Caroline. She left the amish ways and came back as a lawyer to help maintain their way of life. Nettie a amish friend of Hannah's is murdered. Hannah takes on the case of figuring out who killed Nettie. She helped in the last case and wants to on this one. Caroline helps which leads to some funny not to mention interesting things happening.Nettie has a Twin Jennet who comes for the funeral and tries to help as well, but does she have something to hide? What about Nettie's daughter Kaitlin, who can not stand Nettie. Then there is the ex husband Bob Adams could he have killed her?I did not figure out who killed Nettie till the end and that makes a good mystery for me."
2,The Atomic Kid Short Review,"My parents remember this as being hilarious when it came out decades ago.... not so today... they waited and waited for the laughs... but, alas, they waited in vain...."
5,These are good,"Well built and decent quality, these cables work as advertised and seem like they will last for years to come."
1,Far to delicate to use,"I could not believe how thin this cable is. It appears very delicate but it is even weaker that it looks. Even the slights tug on the coax separates the connectors from the cable. Don't plan on letting the cable support its own weight even for a few feet, because it can't. It would have been less work to dump this one in the trash can before trying to use it. Better still, don't order one."
5,"Great work, A path which will take us to explore the secrets in the Veda",I found this book very interesting for i have never come across such book which deals with the inner aspects of the Veda Mantras.It has a word to word meaning for each devanagari script.Uniqueness of this book lies in that english title have been provided to each mantra.Very good introductionIts a truely non biased english commentary on Rig Vedafinally thanks to the Author.
3,fashion fashion fashion,its a decent book with some insightful ideas but overall nothing really over the top when it comes to fashion however for the basics not bad at all
2,Come by Me- Harry Connick Jr.,Not one of my favorites. Something to listen to while I am doing housework so that I am not really focused on the music.
1,Terrible version of Danny Boy,Before I bought this download I searched for the Memphis Belle version of Danny Boy by Harry Connick jr I was led to believe that this version was what I was looking for. NOT TRUE!!!! This version is TERRIBLE!!!! 99 cents WASTED!!!!!!
1,This is not a cd to brag about,"I have a lot of Harrys' cds, and this has to be his worst cd. Please let me try to explain why.He tried to do too much on this cd. He was the composer on some songs, the painist, the arranger, and the singer. That's what I would call spreading yourself too thin.I really wish Harry would do another cd along the line of ""When Harry Met Sally"". That really has to be his best cd ever.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."
3,"Not his best albulm, but at least it's Big Band!!","The last two albulm's Harry has made were a lot better than ""She"" and ""Star Turtle."" I have loved Harry since he was just a little piano prodigy. I watched him grow and mold himself into a young Sinatra. But, when he swayed from his roots of big band jazz and started playing ""New Orleans Funk"" I was disappointed. I personally love ""We Are In Love"" and ""Blue Light, Red Light."" I am just glad that he remembered what his fans love the most...plain old swinging Harry."
2,What the heck happened to Harry?,"Is Har-har Binks so bored with music that he's not happy unless he's doing something a little strange with the song? The arrangements seem kind of stilted and the flavor of the music seems too experimental. Where did the magic of ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Blue Light Red Light"" go? This CD was disappointing. Diana Krall is now getting the CD player time that Harry used to get."
2,Very Average,Harry Connick Jr just hasn't been the same since he changed his style and has been playing catch up ever since.Time was he could have done his Sinatra side act and gotten away with it but not any Longer.He is More into Acting than Making Interesting Music any More.in fact I prefer His acting to his Music now.there's no sign of When Harry Met Sally here.whatever Magic he had he lost it.this is Mainly by the numbers.check out his stuff Circa 89-92.His voice is still Pretty Good but the Music just doesn't move me.
2,Not what most people are looking for,"Lady in the shop strongly recommended it, so I took her word for it. Turns out it's only a remover for regular make-up, NOT WATERPROOF. It doesn't say that on the bottle anywhere. I use Mac eyeliner, and it doesn't take it off at all... it merely smears it. Be sure to buy it only if your make-up is waterproof. Otherwise, yes, it's gentle. And the remover foams if you rub it for a while... you can basically use it to take off your foundation, too."
2,good product,"Although some of the shells were broken off of the tiki torches upon delivery, they still were a great prop for our Halloween costumes this year."
3,Pine,No it's cedar that's toxic to guinea pigs. I use pine shavings in my guinea pigs cage because that's what the pet store told me to use.
2,Book suggested for the YOUNG reader,This book is for a school student doing their studies. The information is very general and there isnt any information about salaries! It really doesnt help if you are trying to descide what type of amimal career you are trying to get into.
3,Light on detail,"Andy Stanford is an exceptional trainer, but this book is not his best. He presents a strong case for the Modern Isocolese, but doesn't give much information on how the reader is supposed to do it or make it work for them. Other sections on trigger reset during recoil and trigger prepping are old hat for experienced shooters. I have to admit that I was disappointed."
5,A Fundamental Book,"The book of Andy Stanford was very useful to me. It brings all the fundamentals of shooting (grip, stance, aiming, trigger control, ""follow through"", draw strokes, shooting at move, etc.), explained step by step, telling not only ""what"" to do, but, most important of all, ""why"" to do. However, like I said, it's a book of fundamentals. But it won't be surprise if you learn something absolutely new in a theme you didn't expect to. I'm gonna buy other books of the same author."
3,Surgical? Maybe not. And Stressfire did it better.,"This book is NOT about ""surgical"" accuracy. It IS about achieving ""minute of bad guy"" accuracy with maximum possible speed. It's a bit of a dry read, but does offer some good tips. Most of this stuff was covered by Massad Ayoob in his book ""Stressfire"" thirty years ago.The author does offer some practical tips that Ayoob omitted, and has the benefit of another thirty years of shooting development, but for the most part Ayoob's book is more readable and just as practical."
3,Overall good but...........,"Allright this is my first review period, and therefore also my first pistol intstructional.Overall for learning the basics, I think this is a good book. He discusses positioning of the hands,trigger manipulation,body positioning, raising the gun to your head, and not the other way around. While I am not trying to complain about the history persay, my own preference would have been to skip the history lesson altogether and just put forth more instructional material.Also of note, its my opinion that he spends alot of time discussing the weaver stance for the sole purpose of bashing it, and this is throughout the book. Im okay with reading about the gripes about it, but leave it all in one chapter, and be done with it. I also feel that the title is a bit misleading as he doesnt really talk about the ""speed aspect"" all that much, but as im focussing on the basics its no big deal just something I thought I would point out. But overall, 3 stars."
4,Good Book,"Great Book and help improve your marksmanship. It presents some good practical applications to your shooting skills. I've still not gone to the range and implemented these techniques yet, but plan on doing soon."
5,Great book for reinforcing skills with your own kids or students,"I am a mom, substitute teacher, and reading tutor. I use the resources in this book more than I use any other book. Great exercises to emphasize a variety of skills. I recommend it to all of my colleagues. Also makes a good over-the-summer practice for your own children. (I use it for my 2nd through 5th graders.)"
3,Beautiful throw but thats about it,"The throw is beautiful. The navy blue is vibrant and the snow men really ""pop"" out against the backdrop. However, I agree with the previous reviewer that it isn't the best quality. There is no way this could sell for the list price. I paid more but if you could find it on a Friday sale it would be better. There is very little down on it as well. I am using it as a blankie for my kid's since they sleep in toddler beds. Just wanted to give you a visual so you can know how small the throw is. Good Luck but you will be disappointed if you expect much. Happy Holidays.*Update* My review was based on the $14.99 price I purchased it for before Amazon clearanced them out at $5. Considering that some paid only $5 I would consider that an excellent value."
1,poor operation.,"The rewinder works, only if you stand over it and hold the top down. Otherwise, the video slightly comes up, making it impossible to self rewind. I guess there just isnt a quality rewinder any more for old video tapes."
1,KINYO UV-413 1-WAY VHS REWINDER,"I WOULD NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN. IN THE DESCRIPTION IT STATES AUTOMATIC POP UP. IT DOES NOT POP UP, SO YOU MUST STAND THERE AND POP IT UP MANUALLY. THIS PRODUCT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!"
1,find another option.,"This rewinder, Kinyo UV-413 did not work upon arrival. Doesn't appear damaged, just cheap. I had hoped the other negative reviews were mistaken since there are not many choices for VHS any longer. But what a dud!"
3,Quality Not as Good as Expected,"When I ordered this blade set it was unclear if it's OEM or aftermarket. When I received it it's obvious it's aftermarket. It's not nearly as thick/heavy as the Honda OEM blade. I'm sure it will work o.k., but won't hold up as well and I won't be able to sharpen it as often as the Honda OEM blades."
4,Great Coasters,These are great coasters. The picture on Amazon is very descriptive of the product.The weight of the coaster keeps it in place and will not stick to the bottom of a wet glass.
3,Won't review until I've used it for at least a year!,"Can't review so soon after purchase!All (at least six or seven) have quit working after a few months, so need to use this one for at least a year to see if it stands up. Hope so since it cost triple of my other duds!I would now give this five stars as it is still working great."
4,Rewinder review,Seems to be a good solid rewinder with adequate power to rewind tapes in a short time period and hopefully will last a long time.
2,More Style than Substance . . .,"I agree entirely with the reviewer from Germany - and actually had the EXACT same trouble with my camera, at nearly the EXACT same time! At just about a year, the camera became completely unreliable in its rewinding ability - rewinding on its own in the middle of a roll, or even worse,incompletely rewinding at the end of a roll, but indicating that it was completely rewound (and then THAT roll of film is toast!)Yes, it's sexy. And it attracts alot of attention. But just like all eye candy - it's great for a one-night stand, but not anything you'd want to be married to . . ."
5,"Strong, durable, easy to use","The title pretty much sums it up. While more pricy than the low-end tape, I find the stronger tapes to be a better value since you don't need to use as much, and you don't waste any due to the tape not coming off the roller or not being cut cleanly. This tape is also crystal clear, so no problems taping over address labels without obscuring the writing.Also works great to remove cat hair from suits!"
3,okay,product okay. Good value and shipping on time with good packaging. One thing I was disappointed about was it did not have closed captioning for the hearing impaired.
3,No CAPTIONS,"It's a good show, I remember watching it on TV when it came out, and it was captioned at the time. So when I saw it available on DVD, I jumped on it. Didn't double check to see if it was captioned, as most shows and movies are these days. It's not. So the only reason I gave it three stars, was because I couldn't watch it without captions. Had to return it."
1,does not fit my machine,"while the transaction was fine, the bowl did not fit my machine. not sure what gives."
3,Hmm ..,"I read this book because it's a Daniel Quinn's. I am not going to compare it with any of his trilogy novels; it is simply incomparable. The book brings forth interesting ideas. I would recommend it to Quinn's fans, but do not be disappointed if it doesn't turn out to be as 'brilliant' as Ishmael. It wasn't meant to be."
2,Interesting concept but not worth a whole book,"In the bookstore I frequent this book was under social sciences, I think it would be better placed in the self help section as that is what it reads like.I give Quinn five stars for his message and creative thinking, but its not a great book. A very dramatic title pulls you in and it then starts out with a really interesting conceptual theory about civilization, in that it is not a natural state for humans to exist in, Quinn then goes on to suggest that tribes are a more natural state for us humans to belong to. I agree with his damning assesment of civilisation but I am not sure his mostly vague thoughts about new tribalism is really much of a solution to anyone.With every essay my initial excitement slowly ebbed away as the book went on and on without building too much on its central theme. When Quinn started writing about his own personal 'walk' from civilization was the point where I started skimming looking for a change in direction, it never came."
3,"Excellent points, hampered by the writing.","The main point is that it's an indisputable fact that tribal works well for people, and Quinn set out to show that can still use the tribal lifestyle in a modern world. For some reason he only briefly explained the process of incrimentally working our way back into the same world as animals and undisturbed tribal people. But fortunately Quinn isnt a messiah, and his writing flaws aside, the points stand on their own. They are after all just observations of the way the world works, not expressions of Quinn's great genius. But frankly I'd like to see some other people pick up these ideas and do something with them."
1,....,"Okay, Daniel Quinn has some exciting and new ideas. His beliefs might even shock some of you. .... I enjoy Quinn's work (possibly because when I first read ""Ishmael"" at age thirteen I realized that I wasn't the only one with ""those kind"" of feelings and beliefs about society and our culture in general), but that doesn't mean everything he writes is interesting, fresh, or even particularly well-written. ""Beyond Civilization"" is possibly the worst book I've ever read (aside from some of the *joys* from the mandatory reading lists shoved down students throats in the public school system)! Whatever insight you gain from this book can truly be gained by reading ""Ishmael"" or ""The Story of B"". Don't get caught up in the DQ hysteria, think for yourself ...."
1,Terrible Attempt at old idea,"I picked this up because a friend recommended this author after reading Ishmael. After reading some reviews maybe I should have read his other boks first, but I didn't.This ""book"" is such a waste of money and time. I'm not going to even begin with the ridiculous formatting and structure of the book. The entire idea behind it could be summed up in a two page brochure. You'd be better off just watching/reading fight club or trainspotting or any movie or book that says screw materialism and capitalism. Maybe this would have been a revolutionary idea back in the 50s, but this is all old news, nothing shocking, nothing new. Save yourself the few hours you would have spent reading this and go for a walk instead."
1,pure drivel,"It's books like this that make me embarrassed to have spent the better part of my life working in publishing. Muddle-headed thinking, disgraceful writing, pointless(ly trite) ""Big Questions,"" and equally pointless, not to mention vague and simplistic, Non-Answers--all these make up the meat and bone of this scrawny dog of a book. Just who does Quinn think he is, anyway? Cioran? Nietzsche? Somebody--perhaps his editor, if he or she had even bothered to read the manuscript for this Cliff Notes version of Kultur according to Reader's Digest--should have told the author that aphorism doesn't suit him. Come to think of it, neither does rigorous thinking. In a word, Future Schlock at its very worst."
5,Yay Fluke,"I didn't buy this from amazon, but I have a Fluke review.I lost the coaxial adapter and I could not find just a replacement anywhere. I filled out the customer support form on flukes website and in less then 24 hours the response I got was:""..if you send me your shipping address, I can send an replace adapter out to you.Regards,Carolyn CarterPNT Product ManagerFluke Networks ""AwesomeAlso we have used this toner at work for over 3 years and it is a super handy piece of equipment. Highly recommended."
4,Very Useful,"I had been using a telephone line toner to trace down cat 5 runs in an old existing network. This product has made my life so much easier, especially with the ability to test over live network lines."
5,NICE PRODUCT,GRANDSON LOVED IT. I LOVED GREAT PRICES. PRICES LIKE THESE ARE TAKING ME AWAY FROM EBAY. FAST SHIPPING. REALLY GOOD PRODUCTS. I WILL SHOP THERE AGAIN. THANKS
2,One decent track and the rest are trash,"I'm glad I got this cd for two bucks...it's like I got a single with a bunch of other garbage on it. ""Tight Whips"" is the only decent track (and even that has weak spots), and the rest are trash. There's parts where it sounds like their beat box has screws loose. It's bad when the beats aren't even together, let alone the rappers. Some of the rappers aren't too bad...and then there's T-Bo. He's straight out of ""Malibu's Most Wanted"". He must have been still getting used to that grill when he was recording his part on ""Tight Whips""...""Gold Grill Glithnin, theeth girlth call me Mithter Clean""...Check out the DVD to see how ghetto fabulous the guys live, also to see Master P rant on about a New No Limit comeback that never actually came around."
5,Karate Kid Scores,"Easily one of the most sought after movie scores of all time, and worth every penny. The music for all the movies are quite beautiful, even 3-4."
2,Could be better,"Overall quality is only so-so. comes with own gaskets so no need for plumbers putty but the mounts that secure it to the sink through the extra holes (went from a 3 hole to a one hole faucet) are plastic and don't let you tighten the plate down as much as I would like (afraid to strip threads, crack the post, etc.)"
3,This is the E-Z Play Version,"This is the E-Z Play version of the ""Back to Broadway"" folio.The traditional version (Piano/Vocal) is also called ""Barbra: Back to Broadway"" (ISBN: 0895248069). That edition costs a few dollars more."
1,Poor Book,"There are much better books out there. Content is intellectualy weak, with silly slides as charts. The arguments are well-worn and not crisp. Further, the author adds his own spin to indexing which he does not adequatly suport with argument or evidence.Much better books on indexing are:""Bogle on Mutual Funds"" and ""Winning the Losers Game"""
3,Didn't Help Me,My idea for ordering this item was for it to help start the A/C compressor. I added this to my heat pump and it didn't improve the starting.
3,Not what we had expected,Even for an 11 year old this is a difficult toy. It sounds like a really cool idea but it's not worth the money.
2,Very Disappointing,"As a person with metastatic breast cancer, I bought this book because it seemed to focus on LIVING with metastatic disease when everything else I've read lumps metastatic disease in with death and dying. Unfortunately, this book was more of the same. If misery loves company, then this is the book for you. I, personally, don't want to read about women just like me with diagnoses similar to mine and then read about their death later on in the book. How is that ""uplifting""? When and if the time comes when my disease can no longer be treated, then maybe I would consider a book like this useful. But when is someone going to write a truly uplifting and informative book about LIVING with metastatic disease? Also, the medical information was very sparse and nothing new; in fact some of the information seemed somewhat dated."
2,Very depressing,"This book is very well written, but very depressing. As a woman with advanced breast cancer, I face each and every day with joy and happiness. Each day is a gift, and I plan to unwrap many more. I fill my mind with positive thoughts about LIVING, about being that statistic who makes it, about willing my cancer to go away. And it is. When I was first diagnosed, I purchased this book because I intend to live, and this book promised a guide to that. I ended up in tears after only a short time of looking through this book, because it is more of a guide to dying."
2,Lacking accurate trail description,"Just used this book during our vacation to Telluride. While the authors passion for the Telluride area is very evident the book is lacking in accurate trail descriptions, key trail points, and trail head locations. Great points on local history and trail history. I would recommend purchasing another book for a pure hiking guide."
2,Pretty Poor,"There is too little story or character development. There are many people shooting at each other, dieing, getting burned, bailing out etc. but that is most of the movie if that is what you want. Though I watched it to the end with my wife. we found it quite boring. My son who I thougt would really like the movie got bored after about 45 minutes and left to play his combat flying computer game.The few minute scenes with Polish volunteer pilots with the British RAF was a nice touch."
5,Needed Fully Restored on DVD at 2.35:1 with 5.1 sound,A brilliant film that really would benefit from a proper restoration to the original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio and with 5.1 sound. Excellent cast and story.It seems odd we can get Lawrence of Arabia and various other war movies restored on DVD but not this one. Not only accurate but exciting and a fitting tribute to all the combatants including the American pilots. If this battle had been lost WW2 would have ended in 1940.
4,RAF vs Luftwaffe,"A very entertaining film in glorious color that depicts the gallant stand by the RAF against the German Luftwaffe in1940. Acting by mainly British and German actors in this production is excellent. Sir Laurence Olivier is magnificentas Dowding, the air marshal in charge of the RAF. The film does exaggerate some of the British victories over theirGerman opponents. However, aside from this minor point, the film really is a must see, especially in Blu-ray. I havethe pre blu-ray version and it plays just as well, except for the sound, as the blu-ray version."
5,Never So Few - - Planes Given So Much,"Viewed this film again after seeing it in 1969. The tape was able to still capture the rich colors of the English coast and the song of the Spitfires. As a pilot it was interesting to see such attention to detail. The flight instruments were even correct. Yesterday, I was even able to touch one of the films Spitefires; like so many, it too is retired here in Florida. If you like airplanes and historical dramas this is your film."
5,"Great Movie,they don't make them like they use to","Great cast of stars, who's who of British actors. Great color and great flying action.You cannot go wrong with this one"
5,Historic worl war 11 movie,"This is another classical movie of world war 11. Excellent quality, enjoyable and well worth seeing. Many of the stars in this movie were just starting"
5,Best Toy,"My 7 Yr. old granddaughter has dozens of these and not only plays with them but collects them. I like these toys because it allows a child to actually use their imagination. When my 2 1/2 yr.old granddaughter saw them she couldn't put them down,so now I am buying for her also for the same reason. They really are sooooooooo cute!"
4,A Great Study of Indians,Very enjoyable. I have always felt that the Indians deserved better than what they got. The actors and storyline are very compelling.
4,"Great book, a bit tough for a beginner though","This a great book with a well organized, clear and simple format. The waterproof pages are great and I have got this book completed soaked on the pool deck and it has no probs.Each of the workouts has a long and a short version depending on your swimming ability, however I found that when I first got this book my ability was not even up to the shorter workouts. Overall a great product esp. if you can't be part of a Master's swim team."
5,Great Swim Workouts,"First of all, I'm not a swimmer. So, at first, this book confused me... Not used to all the terminology. However, if you read through it before heading to the pool, it's very easily picked up. The workouts are tough, but you will see results!"
2,It was hard to understand,IT was waterproof so that was nice. However it used way to many abbreviations and i had to look everything up in the back. Complicated.
2,Tapas: The Little Dishes of Spain,"I have been to Spain numerous times and-----This book is full of weird, hard-to-find ingredients. I did not care for it at all. However, her other book, The Foods and Wines of Spain, is great."
1,The book,From someone who has tried to concieve child number 1 for 3 long years this book really confused me and did nothing for me. This is not a book for someone who is suffering from primary infertility. The beginning of the book upset me and I almost didn't give it a chance.
1,Not helpful or inspiring.,"How hearing some woman's sad, sad story and all the sad stories of her famous (but she can't say exactly who) friends helps anybody with infertility is completely beyond me. What a dumb book. I could'nt even make myself finish it. So, unless the second half of the book instantly becomes helpful, I think it is a waste of time. It's not very well written on top of its total uselessness.However, if you don't believe me , I know where you can get a used copy in fabulous condition."
1,bad author,The Beatrice Bailey books are well known in genealogy circles as being a fraud. These books were actually written by a couple of men who claimed to be a teacher writing about her family history. What the buyer gets is pretty much a collection of names from the phone book and some stationary with a non-documented family history.I would not recommend that anyone buy books by this author.
3,Anyone else's leaking??!!,"Don't get me wrong, I love these bottles and have taken them everywhere, so that I don't have to pollute the Earth with Tetrapak containers. BUT, why isn't anyone else having a problem with leaking?! To make matters worse, one of my kid's lunchboxes doesn't have the upright compartment for the Thermos, so it's on its side leaking into the overpriced HK lunchbox. The first week of school, the lunchbox was already ruined! Some days are better than others.At first I thought it was the blue ring on the underside of the cap that needed to be replaced, but it is STILL leaking. Next step is to try and replace the ENTIRE cap. If that doesn't do it, then Thermos will have to send me another style lid or something b/c this is ridiculous!"
2,Anxiety Wrap for Small Dogs - Mini,"I had purchased this wrap to hopefully control my dogs barking. She ended up constantly shaking trying to get it off, didn't help with her barking. I put away for many months, and just put it back on her to control her scratching by putting oils on her skin and now the wrap keeps the oil from getting on furniture. She still shakes but it is serving a purpose."
1,Not worth purchasing.,This item states that it can repair up to 30 disc per pads (its more like 15 to 20). You have to load and unload pads through the process and hit three buttons. Its time consuming and sometimes has to be repeated once or twice on dvds. Save yourself the trouble and buy a little better quality disc fixer.
2,Doesn't do to good,"I got this one because I didn't want to spend more money and thought that it would get the job done. The compound in the back of the unit was leaking and had leaked all over the inside. I tried the unit after getting it cleaned up and although it would clean disks ok it didn't do a very good job of fixing any of them. It also leaves swirl marks on your disks. I sent this one back and got a Simo, much better unit and worth the money."
5,Perfect for the play,We bought this item for a school play. theprice as right and the accessories made the outfit. Product came quickly and was packaged well.
1,Non-fiction? Hardly.,"This book is joke. Having spent many years in the backcountryof Alaska and having had encounters with bears, the author's description of his encounters with bears are far fetched and implausible. The description of the bear in the crevasse with the author and the bear actually forcing the walls of a glacial crevasse to widen is simply ridiculous and impossible. The author describes the challenge of carrying a pan full of water withhout spilling down a treacherous ramp to his cookstove. Well how about filling your water bottle, screwing the lid on tight and bringing the water to the cookstove and pouring it into the pan. There is one example after another of this type of folly that makes you wonder if the author really climbed Mt. Hess. This book is destined to be a bad screenplay for a bad movie. Shame on the publishers for even accepting this poor excuse of a book"
4,Pretty good live CD,"Yeah I know that most of these songs are on albums and everywhere else but many of the songs ( particularly Silence Is Sexy ) allow to track to breathe a bit more. I still don't like it but it sounds a whole lot better than the studio version. Excellent sound quality and bizarre mutterings from Blixa when the song hasn't started at times. They even lost a couple of verses from Newtons Gravititlichkeit ( but I'm sure they have a copy of their album somewhere and will find the lyrics ). Otherwise all I have to say is that the crowd seem to enjoying the show. Perhaps a little too much when you consider that Jubel is 2 and a half minutes of live cheering after Redukt which leaves you wondering "" Was that really necessary? Couldn't they just cut that out? "" Nevertheless an excellent live show. Also if you've been doubtful over which albums you should get of Neubauten - this will come as a handy accessory"
4,Under-appreciated little gem,"Underrated, funny, sad, and touching film with some great moments of playful directorial flair and style.It does get repetitive occasionally, and some of the sentiment is a bit heavy. But it also captures something unique and important about the 1950s, and the very beginnings of feminism.Julianne Moore is terrific, and Woody Harrilson is solid, although his character is (by nature of the story) less completely explored.I don't know why this inventive, fun film didn't find an audience, but it deserves one."
5,"The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio is a great movie","Based on a true story. The first time I saw this movie I was impressed by the amount of patience, understanding, and humor one person could have. I wish that the standards for television still included an intelligent & appropriate selection of commercials, and that I could have had the chance to talk with such a wonderful woman. She has set a good example for me, and I will try to pass it on."
5,Buy This CD if you love Country Blues and Ragtime!,"Ari Eisinger is a great interpreter of country blues and ragtime, and he does it justice on this excellent collection of songs. I was already familiar with Ari through his ""Guitar of Blind Boy Fuller"" DVD he produced for Stephen Grossman's wonderful Guitar Workshop. As a teacher, Ari excels at conveying the music and the nuances of country blues, so I had high expectations for this disc. And Ari does not disappoint. He does Blind Lemon Jefferson, Blind Blake, Blind Boy Fuller, John Hurt, and he throws in two originals for good measure.If you like those pre-war country blues artists, you won't be disappointed with this CD. Good stuff!"
5,My Opinion,"I am a 63 year old female. I have bad arthritis in both knees. After one month of taking this product, I can tell a difference in the AMOUNT of pain so much that I will continue to buy this product. I take 3 TWICE a day. I also take Ultra Omega-3 and take 2 twice a day. NOW is a great product and the price is affordable."
3,Rewinder is not the best,"This item has some problems. But I thought it might, considering the other reviews I read. The lid has problems staying closed on a lot of videos. It must be closed multiple times in order that the tape will rewind. It was a bit aggrivating, but better then rewinding tapes in the VCR. I would consider finding a different rewinder."
2,Be careful !,"STRONG rewind on this product. Sometimes (more often then not) it rewinds to far and you have to rewind the overwind. Bought two at the same time, If I had to do it over again I would have bought another kind."
1,Utter Junk,"This device did not work from the first day I tried to use it. Worse it damaged an irreplaceable tape. I would not recommend this. I was going to return to Amazon, but decided to throw it away instead. Please do not buy this product. It really does not work and it may damage your, currently, irreplaceable tapes."
3,Working very well,"I had the same brand video rewinder for years and it worked fine untilI left it on all night once, but I was so impressed when that happened that it stillworked after that except that it wouldn't pop up anymore when done. But the oneI bought recently has twice made the tape come loose after rewinding. Anda couple of times I couldn't get it to start unless I pushed down hard on thelid. Other than those 2 things it's working ok.June 17, 2008 update---My rewinder is working very well now that it has""settled in"" so I am very happy with it now."
3,"Madonna reflects more energy ,but Not cd combo..dissapointed..","In the original description of this blue ray here in amazon said 2 disc,now that they noticed there is not cd,they changed it to I disc.,I feel cheated....Anyways the picture rocks!!! the performance is wonderful,I'm not madonna's fan, but this tour is the best that Madonna has offered in many years!!!Madonna's voice is perfect in this tour. I guess a lot of technology has been truough...I love the new version of "" Into the groove 2008"" and ""bordeline"",but I hate ""vogue 2008"" with the music of 4 minutes mixed ????????????In general, it is the best Tour, and Madonna looks more ""warm"" in her performances..I wonder if I can buy only the cd with the music tour?????????? not the dvd/cd combo..."
4,Sticky & Sweet Tour Blu-Ray Review,"First you need to know there is no cd that comes with this blu-ray. Just got my copy today from Amazon. The concert is amazing on blu-ray!!! Not too many stores are carrying the blu-ray version. The backstage feature is a great high light of the video. It shows Pharrell and Justin Timberlake on it guest starring on her shows!! If you are a Madonna fan and have a blu-ray player I recommend you get the blu-ray version, but remember there is NO cd that comes with the blu-ray. The cd only comes with the dvd/cd combo"
3,Very nice but not the best,"The blu ray transfer is not the best, it has it's moments, but i enjoyed the concert. She is for sure one of the best females performers of all times. I gave it 3 stars for the quality of the blu Ray not for the show."
5,wonderful condition,One of my favorite groups that disbanded years ago.I was surprised that i could still find it as I wore my previous copy out a long time ago.
1,I will never buy Duracell Rechargeables again,"First time I charged it , well it came for a 10 days on my digital camera (around 80-100 pics) . Fully charged it second time and when I put it into camera ,I got the low battery symbol . Tried recharging again and this time after 2 clicks low battery symbol started flashing . I would have been better off buying a normal battery ."
1,Useless Batteries - Bad Batch,"While Duracell rechargeables are great, and this seems like a good deal. This specific batch of batteries is definitely defective. they do not hold their charge at all, literally 2 days after you perform a full charge they have no life left. stone dead within a week. you will endlessly be swaping these out!Duracell is completely aware of the bad batch of batteries when I called them to complain. They are supposedly sending me coupons for replacement batteries after I mail my bad batteries to them, it's been 6 weeks since I first called Duracell and they have not sent the coupons as of yet. I called again today and they still have my case open, but there's no eta on when my coupons will be mailed.Frustrating!"
4,soul sex,"An outstanding, well written book that points out the obvious and the not so obvious points to make your sex life better than you could ever emagine. a must read for couples starting a relationship or looking for the extra spark to make a good relationship great."
3,Relief or regret?,"If asked which 'R' best describes my feelings about this new series (pardon my reference to Kill Bill), I'd have to say it was a mix of both.Relief that... finally I can see what happened after the point where Viz Comics put the series on hiatus.... the new series, with a few exceptions, follows the comic.... I get to see the awesome Guyver Gigantus unleashed.Regret that... this series still isn't finished even after 26 episodes.... the quality of the animation is sub-par in comparison to other series made about the same time.... the story doesn't have the fast pacing of the earlier series.... this version wastes a lot of time rehashing stuff you saw already (and taking more episodes to do it!)Should you collect it? If you have the original series, I'd wait until this series catches up to where the previous series left off. If you don't, despite it's flaws, it isn't a bad series to add to your collection."
4,Little House On the Prairie,"This version of Little is some what different than the version with Melissa Gilbert and Michael Landon.It tell how the Ingalls family travel from Winconston to Kansas. There is Charles, Caroline, Mary, Laura, Mr. Edwards but no Carrie.This is truly a good movie to see with your kids."
3,Why do they do this???,"My son and I have been reading the Little House books together and when I found that Disney made a Little House movie I decided to buy it. The music didn't fit at all and the books, themselves are full enough of thrilling stories to fill a movie. Nothing needs to be added, but of course they always do. They portrayed Laura in too much a ""Girl Power"" way instead of the sweet and determined girl that she was. Danielle Chuchran (Mary Ingalls and a former neighbor of mine) was not the right choice for her role either. Just read the books."
2,Beautiful Cinematography/ NOT True to the Books,"This DVD does have beautiful cinematography, just as some other reviews have said. The outdoor scenes are very realistic in portraying what the rugged woodlands and prairies of the late 1800's were probably like. However, many reviews have claimed that this miniseries was closer to following the events in Laura Ingalls Wilder's book series than any other television series or movie has ever been, and after watching it we were very disappointed that it does not follow the books more closely at all. If anything there are even more differences than those described in Laura's books. I would not recommend buying this if you are looking for a closer portrayal of the events in the Little House book series. If you enjoy a different presentation for a good family movie, and enjoy the beautiful and realistic scenery, it might be a good choice."
4,Green Jade ring,"Jade, and especially nephrite jade, is a stone of Heavens, that help you to get Power of Cosmic Forces if you possesses it. All Chinese Emperors knew this and all Great Seals were made on Jade base, it was valuated much more than Silver or Gold. But some people had taught ancient Chinese, Mayas, Sumerians and Egiptians, all of whom sacred Jade. And only jade today is a trace of this teachings."
2,We Never Went To The Moon,"This video asked some interesting questions about NASA's Apollo photography, but that is about it. Very short on details and is redundant. If you are intersted in this subject, there is lots of other material that does a much better job. Sure, maybe much of the data was faked, but to what end? Did we not go or was some of the data faked to hide what was found on the moon? I think those are much bigger questions that may never be answered."
5,very interesting,The movie was truley an interesting movie. I always knew that we never went to the moon. If you think we went to the moon watch this video it will change your mind. I would give it a perfect 10 but the scale only goes to 5!!!!!!!!
3,"Cute idea, but not worth the $","My son really wanted this when he saw it at the store. Once we got home and opened it, I realized it was nothing more than a modern version of the magic write on(lift up to erase) boards of our youth. Unfortunately, this concept doesn't work too well on this toy. Soon after he draws a picture, it begins to blur on the screen and he becomes very frustrated. The magnadoodle version isn't much better...very fuzzy pictures. The best (and cheapest) version is still the classic Handy Dandy notebook with the crayon and wipe-off pages."
3,Not Really Worth it,"My 4 year old daughter begged for this toy, and since she enjoyed similar toys, such as her little travel MagnaDoodle, I bought it for her. She does pull it out and trys to play with it occasionally, but the writing surface is terrible, nothing stays ""written"" on it, which is very frustrating. The little pull up page versions of these I played with as a kid lasted longer. She won't get rid of it though, because she loves Blues Clues."
1,terrible quality,One of these glasses broke just by my setting it in my sink. They are so thin! I put them in my china cabinet and don't touch them. Pretty to look at only!
4,Nice Bag,"The Jansport Air Cisco bag was not the most expensive messenger bag but it is well built, has lots of pockets and rides nice over the shoulder.Holds an Ipad, lunch box and papers plus doubles as a purse.Good item."
5,Best overall history of the North Africa campaign 1940-2,Mr Henniger must have been reviewing a heavily bowdlerizedversion of Pitt's excellent history (there's at least onepretty badly produced reprint).This is bar none the best military history of the N. Africacampaign 1940-2 with EXCELLENT maps!However I have a cheap paper reprint by Macmillan (PaperMac)that is awful by comparison with the recent three volumetrade paper edition on acid-free paper --Enjoy!
1,vastly disappointed,This is not a coherent account of the campaign in North Africa. There is no maps to indicate the movement of the armies. The author does not do an adaquete job of combining the mitlitary strategy of the North African campaign with the personal narratives. I would reccomend the Desert Generals by Corelli Barnett and the biography of Rommel by David Fraser to understand the North African campaign but defnitely not this book!
5,"So good, so hard to find AFK","Bittersweet chocolate, so, not so sweet that it hurts your teeth, but very flavorful. Bittersweet is a bit of a misnomer, because it is still sweet, just not oversweet. And, to quote George Carlin: ""Milk chocolate is for schmucks"""
1,Don't Waste Your Time...,"This was one of the worst train wrecks of a book that I have ever read. The writing is fine, but the author is a spoiled, whiny child with severe mommy and daddy issues. Throughout the entire book I just wanted to slap her and tell her to grow up. Save your money."
3,"Good, but....","This is a memoir written by Jenny Lauren (of Ralph Lauren fame)in which she describes the deep pain food has caused her in her life.I admire Jenny for being so honest with us and sharing her story. I honestly felt in physical pain when she would describe her symptoms and tell of her pain.I also deeply admire her for being so forthcoming about her struggle with food, bulimia and binges. On this note, though, I don't feel as though the book really gives us the path which Jenny took to go into recovery of this disease. Towards the midlle to end of the book, food becomes less obvious (which is great) but we never do quite find out why.THE ONE major flaw with this memoir. THE TONE IS TOO WHINNY!! It was quite a turn off to me. Although I know the author was not intentionally doing it, she came across, at times, as a poor, little rich kid. It really turned me off to the rest of the story.Still, though, I congratulate Jenny on her honesty."
1,A Whiny Romp,"Ms. Lauren grew up, apparently, in a society with no values except looking good. In the process, she apparently began showing signs of eating disorders in childhood, problems that resulted in permanent physical damage. Even with her family's corporate interest in appearance, had they maintained some religious connection other than fashion, the writer might have learned respect for her body.That said, there's nothing in this book that shows she realizes her familial obsession with style and appearance is a root cause of her problems, or any rejection of a system which glorifies appearance at the expense of health and sanity.Not to mention that it's hard to feel terribly sorry for someone who has apparently never had to work a 40 hour workweek and live on a budget and was still able to pursue endless medical attention for her ills. Most people with chronic illnesses, self-inflicted or not, do not have those luxuries."
2,Empty Memoir Attempts to Cash in on a Trendy Cultural Issue,"I was sorely disappointed by this ""memoir,"" as 90 percent of it seemed to be devoted exclusively to Jenny Lauren's bowel woes. Very seldom did she specifically discuss the eating disorder or its emotional roots, and the occasional reference to the influence of the fashion culture seemed forced and empty. She spent the first several hundred pages sharing the gory details of her gastrointestinal issues, yet she rushed through her miraculous ""healing"" with just a few vague pages. Having dealt with anorexia and bulimia myslef, I know there are much, much deeper issues at work, both in the struggle and the healing. Jenny Lauren chose to ignore these when chronicling her ordeal. The book lacked emotion and substance, and it left me hungry for something more."
2,A good date movie.,I ordered this movie to see Ian Somerhalder in a role other than a vampire. It was the typical cheesy date movie that you could guess what was coming next. I did get a kick that Somerhalder's main character had the same last name as mine.
3,Predictable,you can guess from the moment boy meets girl how this storey is going end. the film is entertaining as far as romance films go. however it seems like the writer couldn't come with a sub plot and ended up trying to tell too many stories. but if you can move past that for the most it tells a storey of how people deal with the grief of loss and isn't a bad film. it helps that Ian Somerhalder is easy on the eye.
4,comfortable,"bought this product for my husband for christmas and he likes it alot. its not only comfortable but also has rubber treading on the bottom, which makes it great to wear even outside."
3,Not my choice for the world's best cat litter,"I do like that this managed to both clump and not be made out of clay, so in that regard it's great. But it seems corn is about the dustiest material you can make cat litter out of, because it is absolutely not dust free as claimed. A cloud of dust rises whenever the litter is slightly disturbed. In adition it smells ""all natural"" - like weird, food-y corn smell that then gets mixed with the smell of cat urine, which it's not very good at masking. It didn't track terribly and my cats used it readily. But I think the best clumping non-clay cat litter is Scientific Professional cat litter, so this one isn't the world's best after all."
1,Bad Bad Smell,"Bad odor from litter when used just a couple times. There is NO order blocking agent. Just corn. Corn is biodegradeable yes, but it also rots and smells too. I ws constantly cleaning corn dust cat foot prints too. It does clump urine well, but the odor is not worth it..."
1,Too dusty,"Maybe this is the world's best cat litter for corn farmers because it's so expensive. But our biggest complaint is it's too dusty. When you shovel and rake it, you're going to inhale big clouds of dust that blow up a couple of feet into the room. I don't think the cats appreciated all that dust blowing up in their faces when they dug in it either, because they've been avoiding the box that has this litter in it, and it used to be the most popular box due to its location when it had cheap clay litter in it. We won't be trying it again."
3,"works, but it is cheap","The USB connections on the front need to plug into one of your open USB plugs in the back. The card reader slots take one of the USB pin outs from the motherboard of your computer. A better product would have had both devices only eating up one of your USB outputs. Also, only one side bolted into my 3-1/2 floppy drive bay: the non-USB port side. As a result, the USB side is ""squishy"" and mashes into the PC case whenever I try to plug a USB device into that slot. I would not buy one again."
1,El Stinko,"Poorly acted, laughable sets and non-stop diatribe against Christians generally and the Catholic Church specifically.Apparently, all it takes to call oneself a historian today is a contempt for organized religion. It also helps to loath western culture as well. As for the history of the plague itself the reasoning would be unworthy of a C as part of a grade school book report."
2,I started to program using this language.,"This book is great, if you own an old Apple II, to start out and learn the field of programing. It covers the basics of programing. I liked it, but now it is out of date to today's computers."
3,"OK, BUT HIS NEW STUFF IS BETTER","well i have to say this cd is good, but the price is a little high. eric did a decent job in the Christian pop world as you can hear on this cd, but his new Christian modern rock stuff is much better. the songs on LOVERS HEART is mostly bubblegum pop material, but its still ok. the best songs are ""smilin"", and ""living free."" the rest of the songs are ok. if you are into groups like Wilshire or early Newsboys, then you should find thid cd decent to your liking."
3,It's not all bad,"The Counter Reformation, by A.G. Dickens is certainly not for the uneducated and does require an extensive vocabularly to read with ease. However, in relation to other books on the subject, it is one of the lighter works. The pictures are fantastic and the book is of high quality. Dickens is quite objective in his representation of the counter reformation and links it in with Luther and Calvin quite well. This is a scholarly book, though also an overview rather than an in depth study. Dickens provides a helpful discussion at the end of the book to interact with the reader on all that he has read.Not for the faint hearted, but if interested in this particular it is worth adding to your collection of others on the same topic."
3,Think of it as heavy-duty office tape,"I've been using the heavy duty Scotch package tape (or as heavy-duty as clear tape gets) for years and I like it. I thought I'd give this a try to see what it was like, and it was pretty much as expected: It's nice to be able to tear it easily, but it's too light to really be effective on a package that one is shipping unless you use far more of it than you would with regular packing tape.In the long run it'll be far cheaper to buy a decent tape applicator/dispensor and heavy duty tape. The applicator makes it easy to use and you'll save money on the tape.On the other hand, if you need thicker, heavier office tape, this works fine."
3,"OK, BUT","The tape itself is fine, good for sealing boxes or packages, and it's nice that you can tear it easily by hand, so that you don't need scissors to cut it, but I think it does need a dispenser or something, because the tape is clear, so it is easy to lose the end, which you will need the end for the next time you need to use the tape.I ended up putting a flag at the end of the tape, so that I wouldn't lose the end.I also would have preferred one larger roll, instead of two smaller rolls. Just a personal preference."
3,It's tape,"Tape works well for holding papers together, on packages or whatever. Can tear with hands but scissors are nice, too."
3,I wouldn't buy again,"Since there is no dispenser to this roll of tape due to it's ability to be torn by hand, this means each time you pick it up to tear a piece off, you have to pull/peal (start) it off the roll by hand. In my experience, this always leaves a tiny corner of the tape which doesn't stick to the package - which makes the tape fairly easy to remove."
4,Surprising,"I, thirteen-year-old Sarah have read all the books in this series so far and liked them. Now, i personally favored this book the most. Although the back of the book seems to tell the story/plot (like they always do) this one leads you off. It made me suspect someone else. That's all i can say (without giving the book away), so read Every Dog Has His Day by Bob Balaban!~*Sarah*~"
1,"No expiration date, and massively inflated price.","$45 for one pack? Yikes. Maybe if they actually told you it had expired (relatively) recently. But, they don't. So you're overpaying (by a lot) for an unknown product. Avoid."
3,Pretty good medical thriller,"I am a nut for medical mysteries and this one pretty much kept my attention. Read it on my kindle fire at the gym.Very few typos, and pretty good writing. I would read this author again. Got a bit draggie towards the end, then I started skimming."
3,Great...with one bothersome quality.,"I got to see this show ""out of town"" in Los Angeles and thoroughly enjoyed it. The soundtrack is a great treat also. My only qualm is that ""Linda Low"" sounds a bit flat on her tracks. I wish that the producers had paid a bit more attention to that. Cannot wait to see it again on Broadway."
2,Good in parts but nothing to great.,"I like independant comics but only a few stories in this collection caught my attention, namely the Concrete story, Floating Heads and the Sack Murder. This anthology just doesn't do the company justice. Shame really."
5,Love the tape,"Love this tape I am moving I seal the boxs with this tape. I only use Scotch brand, its the best!. also thanks for fast shipping and your price for 4 rolls of tape is the best ever. Thank You!"
4,decent tape for the price,This tape works pretty good but it has a habit of bunching up and not laying flat leaving airbubbles and creases in the tape (important on shipping labels). Otherwise it sticks well to boxes and holds up very good.
3,Not super sticky,"I used this for moving, but was disappointed when the tape would come off of the boxes. This didn't cause any major headaches, and certainly nothing came out of the boxes, but it was annoying to find the tape flopping around along the side of the boxes."
2,might as well be no name brand,"the tape is very thin ... If this was some cheap no name brand I will say ""well, you get what you pay for"" ... but this is from 3M ... very disappointed."
4,"Great tape, sticks well!",I bought this tape as I am moving. It's held up very well.Pros:-Sticks very well to cardboard boxes-Price on Amazon is great-Don't need to apply multiple layers to make it stickCons:-Would be nice to have a dispenser come with it (but you buy one separately if it's important)
5,Bravo Bava,"Wow!What an absolute freak-outof a gothic horror movie.Surrealistic mayhem.Beautifully filmed, scored and acted.It gets weird.I will have to watch ittwenty more times to ""get it"",that is, if there is anything to ""get"",not that it matters.Something to do with the nature of existence,the human condition and evil, no doubt; maybe.Great film."
1,Very cheaply made and cheap looking,"I purchased these to replace the old wiper arms on my classic car. When I opened the package I was amazed at what a cheap looking piece of junk they were. I thought they would be a brushed stainless steel finish like every other wiper arm I have seen. These look like they were sprayed with an aluminum colored paint. These were so cheap looking that I threw them in the trash and put the old ones back on which, by the way, were old but twice as good looking as these new pieces of junk. DO NOT PURCHASE THESE, you will definitely be disappointed to say the least!"
4,"Entertaining, but a bit lazy","This is a very entertaining book, and isn't targeted at train buffs (who'll probably be annoyed by the semi-random collection of topics covered). Kennedy has a great eye for stories about the subway and each chapter/column is long enough for him to have written something really interesting about the topic. My only criticism is that the book would have benefited from some editing to turn it into more than just a collection of newspaper articles; an introduction in which Kennedy explains how he went about reporting on the subway would have been great, and some sections of the book's later chapters repeat topics covered in earlier chapters and could have been cut."
4,A little flavor of the Big Apple,"I've traveled a bit but I've never spent any time in NYC. I am going to spend a week in the city in October and besides some good tour books I wanted to read something that made me feel like I lived in the city. This book was a nice journey. The essays are well written and amusing but also help explain, for those of us who live elsewhere some of the humanity and heart of the city and why people love to live there..."
2,OK,this subwoofer is great if you only want a lot of bass. However when cranked up to even low volumes a strange rattle comes from the inside which is highly annoying.
2,Not so good,"""Every Little Thing About You,"" was one of Lori Wicks books at the bottom of my favorites. It seemed to drag and repeat itself. Books like "" Wings of the Morning,"" and ""Pretense,"" keep you interested. They were both well written and I could picture the events in my mind. "" Every Little Thing About You,"" was good aside from how it dragged on."
3,Not like the others ...,"I'm a huge Lori Wick fan, and while this book was good reading, I was a bit disappointed. I didn't feel that Mrs. Wick gave enough of an explanation as to why Liberty shouldn't be a sheriff. While Slater's reaction may have been true to the day, the fact that Liberty was a sheriff at all did not seem to be, and therefore his reaction seemed sexist instead of gentlemanly Christian. Several things that occured in the novel seemed to be written in solely as plot devices and not completely thought through. I will most likely continue to read this series, and will probably at some point reread this book (as I like to do with all Mrs. Wick's other books), but it'll not be on my list of favorites."
4,A Heartwarming Romance,"Another winner by Lori Wick! The story is wonderfully written with a number of twists and turns. The story is set in Shotgun, Texas in the 1800's. One twist in the story is that the deputy is a woman by the name of Liberty(Libby). She ""backs up"" her Sherrif brother(Griffen) because she is a very good shot. However a stranger comes to town and turns everything upside down for Libby. Hence the romance story. If you pick this book up, it will be hard to put it down, it is a very easy read."
1,Don't.,"This Book is a disappointing presentation of Miss Post's guide to Doing the Right Thing. It's not formatted, as it's been scanned by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and printed without illustrations. It's just not pretty. As the book is still in print and this is not a rarity (the benefit of buying OCR books scanned from old musty gems) you should just go ahead and buy the newest edition. It'll be a much lovelier read."
3,Advice is wonderful! Context could be better.,The advice on etiquette was very eye opening. I enjoy this book but it is quite long. Definetely not your modern day read. But it is brilliant covering every topic from how to properly introduce two people two how to make polite conversation. Very insightful. Read it if your patient even if your not skim through it.
2,Hit and Miss,"Beyond the consistently poor (if any) customer service you can expect to receive from iSkin, the product itself is of questionable quality and value. While it does perform the function of protecting the keyboard and the space between the keys from dust and day-to-day use, the material is not very durable.Right out of the packaging the material had stretched (or was formed improperly from the beginning) so that extra material made the cover bunch up and ripple over some keys.Additionally, after the very first washing to clean the cover, the material stretched in other areas, and has not returned to shape in nearly a week. At this point I am not holding out hope.I have, however, seen some users with this keyboard cover that fits well and does not hinder typing."
1,Engineers Only,"This book is clearly intended for engineers or those studying engineering (asthe other reviews indicate). For everyone else, it may as well be written inMayan glyphs. I sent it back."
1,Suitable for Extremist Agendas Only,"One thing stands clear from reading the many reviews: those supporting this abysmal biography are clear-cut, tinfoil hat right-wing ideologues on the rampage against 'The Liberal Beast'. If you doubt this, take a look at the other books they've reviewed. Also, none of them can in any sense of the word be termed China hands. Lacking any trace of objectivity, (like Jung Chang herself) they lose all credibility as fair-minded reviewers.Those criticizing this book on the other hand, all agree that Mao was a dictator. It is not Mao they are defending; they are merely critiquing the poor scholarship and blatant agenda of the authors to promote their version of Mao with complete disregard for historical accuracy.So readers, the choice, as always, is yours: factual history (meaning: give this book a wide berth), or barefaced distortion and falsehood (meaning: have at it)."
2,Skeptical,"I stopped reading at about pg 300 as I began to suspect that what I was reading was more of a screed than a biography. While I have no doubt that Mao was a murdering, incompetent butcher - it's hardly a debatable observation and was of course a well-known fact before this book came along - I just got the feeling that there was a pseudo-religious zeal in these authors' portrayal of everything Mao ever did as evil, corrupt, ineffective at best and disastrous more often than not. They get their foot on Mao's throat on Page 1 and don't let up. Now while he might deserve it, I just never got the sense that what the authors were saying was necessarily totally accurate. And it's a very long book to read if you have doubts about the authors' intent and factual honesty."
2,Poorly executed,"I bought this book because I was hoping to read a new account of one of history's most glossed over mass murderers, but I was very disappointed by the lack of simple foot or end noting of the authors' sources. One can not write a book that calls into question the veracity of some of the most prominent events and people of the 20th century and then not offer actual evidence. There are many better books than this about Mao that do offer sources. Read those instead."
1,Unreadable,"I was very disappointed with this book. The substance was thin at best. It was not what I was expecting. I thought there would be more detail on Mao's life. A more pronounced understanding of the man and what drove him. What was presented appeared to be no more than speculation. I really don't think that Mao's preoccupation with his bowel movements is overly relative, yet the author felt this was important enough to mention more than once. Just a very inept presentation of the story of a man with significant impact on world history. I expected a lot better."
5,"""M-a-o"" spells murder in any language","This book is an excellent, scorching review of Mao's malevolence and the truths that his many apologists (including many of the reviewers here) would like to bury alongside the bodies of uncounted tens of millions of Chinese civilians murdered by Mao's genocidal movement. Will his defenders next applaud Hitler's concentration camps or Stalin's purges? Anyone who believes in the greatness of Mao needs to read this book, and discard or discount the obfuscating denials that his ghoulish fans will throw about in the wake of this brilliant expose."
3,Quality Over Content,"I was very pleased with the quality of the DVD. The content was good for a 1970's type of movie. I purchased it to travel back down memory lane, I saw a part of this movie many years prior and couldn't find it anywhere else but right here. Thanks a bunch for bringing back some old memories."
1,Not a vegetarian DHA option.,"I am a vegetarian and was looking for a DHA that was animal product free. The product sounded good online being from natural sources and we ordered it. Upon receipt, we were disappointed to find that the first ingredient was gelatin. We immediately returned it. However, it would have been good to know that this product is NOT a vegetarian product to save us time. Marketing needs to do a better job at informing their clients."
4,A super fun twist to your weekly workout routine!,"I just bought this video a week ago, and I've already done it four times! It's a fun workout and you can tell the actors are having a good time too. The moves are very easy, and I picked them up fast. Jackie Vankatwyk has the personality of cardboard, and her loose hair kept making me want to run up and hold it back out of her face. Other than that, my only complaint about this video is that I wish it was longer. The actual kick boxing segment is only 20 minutes, which leaves me wanting more. I start out with a 20-50 minute stairmaster workout, do the Kick Butt video, and then I've gotten my fat burning time in."
3,"Good for beginners, but read up on proper form","It's been a while since I've done aerobics, and the theme seemed interesting enough to get me started again. I think the video totally missed out on explaining and demonstrating proper form. I had to read a few basic books on martial arts to do the kicks and punches correctly. You risk injury otherwise. Others may disagree, but it's supposed to be a kickboxing video, so it's not too much to ask for some slow, visual demonstration of proper kicks and punches. Badrino was ok to follow, but the other two seemed more distracting than anything else (they obviously didn't read that quick instructional on proper form at the beginning). The abs and weight workouts were good, though not much kickboxing there. Overall, I think it's a decent workout, but don't expect to 'kick butt' afterwards, or learn much about kickboxing."
2,Barely worked up a sweat!,"This was the most disappointing exercise video I had ever purchased. Fifteen minutes of actual aerobics, hardly enough to do any good. Ideal for beginners and those who want to ""feel"" that they had a good workout with the allusion of doing ""kick-boxing"" techniques. The video itself is rather poorly shot with the camera moving around the ring blocking the view. One gets the impression that this video was done purely for a quick-buck, which no doubt it was! The abs-exercises were good, however, along with the weight routine and warm-ups. Otherwise, save your money on this one. You will work up a better cardio by parking your car to the farthest corner of the parking lot and walking to the store to purchase the video!"
4,Excellent insider's view of the music industry,"Negus, a culutral studies-oriented scholar wrote an excellent book called Popular Music In Theory: An Introduction in 1996. He continues his thorough, informed approached in this fascinating sociological, economic and ethnographic look at the recording industry.He clearly explains the intricacies of portfolio management, marketing and targeting, resource distribution and cultural attitudes regarding the way music is created and distributed. He uses specific examples from his own primary research regarding genres like rap, country and salsa.I am working on my Ph.D and I found the book challenging and accessible. I would recommend this to anyone who wants insights into music marketing."
5,Fastball,"This CD is the best. It includes 3 hit songs. The Way, Out of My Head, and your an ocean. It also includes 2 other songs. This is a must buy for any music lover."
4,A bit too heavy...,"The product is high-end, consumer class, non-isolating UPS. The old models (like this one) accept any size 12 Volt battery - such as a deep cycle marine battery. Most customers may want the included battery, however, the battery doubles the shipping weight (and shipping price)."
3,Shunga,"As an artist researching this subject, the art is quite good, and numerous examples of different styles are included in this book. What is confusing is that the text does not fit the art. Although enjoyable in their own right, if I wanted written Japanese erotica I would have sought that exclusively."
1,Useless,"Almost offensively useless. Typos all over the place - and the best of all - confusion for Confucian! The texts are fairy tale type fables, totally unconnected with the prints, which are unidentified and undated, presented in an unsystematic hodge podge.The author claims to have identified erotic literature dating from 5000 years ago. Pre Shang dynasty! What literature is that?"
1,Problems with mine...,It was so so so sensitive to line voltage that it would shutdown and alarm when it wasn't necessary... on a couple occassions waking me up in the middle of the night.Eventually it failed to the point where it just randomly shutdown my computer.
3,Basic instruction guide...,"It was a bit basic but it did provide a good foundation for swinging the 'chucks. The photos are a bit confusing at times, but I've been able to figure them all out eventually. What I find lacking is the philosophy behind the nunchaku movements; in other words, why do we do such things or why do we decide to go in this direction? Understanding the philosophy to the art will help users develop their own techniques and styles..."
1,Pure Bosh,"What a deep, deep woman this Maya Angelou is. At least this book ADMITS it's for little kids, unlike a lot of her other work."
4,Good,"Actually, give 4 stars, this one was a good stuffs cos it has a two different features movies in one set"
4,Great BOOK,I loved this book. It not only talked about the power of one person but she had sexy dealings with vampires and other magical creatures as well. I didn't know until I got done reading that this was her only book! NOw I have to wait on another one...that's sad. I wish there was a few more sexy parts but this was very well written and kept me reading around the magic.
2,...,i was Seriously disappointed with this book i had a feeling i wouldnt be able to read it.i got so many good reviews and i read the plot synopsis years ago and knew i wasn't going to like it. Despite this i still tried. The story of it could have been interesting except for the fact that every 2 lines of dialog its streams into this whole bit of straight descriptive text that could be relative but if you skipped it you could still follow the story... i couldnt even finish it.
1,ok but confusing,this book was good at first but got very confusing fast. Too much time was spent on the whole politics of the vampires and not enough on the charactors. Might get the next one in the seies at a used book seller.
4,Great book!,"I had never heard of this book before I bought it, but I loved it! Karen Chance's writing style is similar to Laurell K. Hamilton. There are lots of fantasy critters (wereanimals, faeries, mages, vampires, etc.), and lots of action. I definitely recommend this book!"
4,Worth the read,"I really enjoyed reading this book. The book was a little hard to follow at first, as there were a lot of different characters introduced in the first 100 pages. I also had to ease into the alternate reality Ms. Chance has created, which is much different than most vampire genre.I'm glad I kept with the book though because it gradually pulled me so deeply into the storyline that I now cannot wait until the sequel is out (Fortunately it's a short wait for me as it arrives on bookshelves in early April.)It's a very well-written, engrossing story with lots of twists and turns. I especially enjoyed her back-story of the Dracula family.If you're looking for something a little different but still of the vampire romance genre, this is a good book to try."
4,Fun series,A fast paced urban fantasy series with lots of action and some nice quirky fun. The first couple books seem a bit disjointed to me but by the third book the writing picks up nicely. These books are fast paced with few pages spent on filler. Most every page is part of some action sequence. Cassandra is a fun heroine and fortunately avoids the drug use unlike the Dorina books.
2,So So,"I really wanted to like this book. It started off well but I found myself struggling to get through it. I think that my main problem is that it seems derivative of Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series. I started seeing similarities everywhere and it took away from the story. Also, the explanations of Cassie's world are overly convoluted and somewhat confusing. The story also ends rather abruptly - obviously setting up a sequel.I might give the sequel a try, maybe I can forget my disappointment by 2007."
4,Great read!,"Not having attempted Faulkner since high school, I decided to try this one, seeing the reviews that it was light-hearted and comedic. I have to say, I was not disappointed! It took a little while to get back into understanding the writing style, but once I did, I appreciated it that much more. His style does give you the feeling of being inside someone's head while they are telling a story. Parts of this book really did make me laugh out loud! Parts, especially when Lucius learns Miss Corrie's profession, and what it means, made me tear up a bit. To be that innocent again! All in all, this was a great story. I think it was a great reintroduction to Faulkner, and I will have to try some of his other works now!"
3,OK Item,"bought because of 10 rebate advertised, only got $5 though. 2 copies of same form advertised as separate rebates.this device has slower copy time than most USB thumb drives, but still works decently."
4,A great Video,"Although I felt this was a great video, it just wasn't worth five stars, in my opinion---perhaps four and a half. I loved it, but the format is a little bit like the flicks they used to show us back in school... still, well done, and well worth watching, several times."
4,Great Teaching Tool,"I took Highland dancing for many years, and worked as an assistant teacher. This cd is a great teaching tool. It has 37 songs - from basic pas de basques to the Earl of Errol. It has fast and slow versions of most dances - Fling, Sword, Seann Truibhas, Strathspey and Reel, Jig, Hornpipe, Lilt, and Flora. Not to mention all different step lengths. This is great for practicing on your own at home too."
2,very poor packing,this is shipped just the way its sold no packing no envelope ripped dirty looks used or taken from the trash this was part of a gift i am embarrassed to have wasted my money and i would not recomend anyone else to order from this company very poor customer service
4,Love it but....,I love this magazine but many things are repetitive and the page that has websites you can go to to supposedly register for prizes or do certain things such as one of the latest to design your room [..] never work. I have not been able to do one thing on any I have ever tried.
2,Its Definitely Changed Over The Years,"I started getting Woman's World when it first hit the stands back in 70's (It was 50 cents a week, at that time). It has definitely changed over the years, and I don't think its been for the better. I'm seriously thinking of taking it off my list."
5,Review of Woman's World Magazine,"I chose this magazine because I enjoy the many articles, the puzzles and the great recipies. Prior to having the subscription, I purchased this magazine every week from my local grocery store, as long as it stays as it is, I will continue reading it."
1,BORING really bad porn,"I love adventure books. So I had really high hopes for this. I thought maybe it was a love story / adventure, mystery about a mercenary and a jungle doctor. Well, it is, but only in name. What it is, is just page after page, chapter after chapter of really bad porn. I think a lot the dialogue may have been taken straight off porn videos. I can't repeat it here because it is just full of 'F' bombs and such. What a disappointment. If it's just porn, just say it is and don't give it a description as if there is some sort of story here. And the writing is so bad, I don't even really have anything to compare it to. I'll never buy anything again by this author. Anybody want a like new book cheap?"
3,Hardly original but still entertaining...,"Although this reads quite well and is rather entertaining, it's quite predictable and not very original. Other reviewers have referred to Hornblower and Aubrey and Mathurin, with the male surgeon becoming here a female librarian IT expertThose who liked Honor Harrington from Weber are probably going to go for this one also - the themes are somewhat similar - but they might be a bit disappointed - at least I was because I found the story entirely predictable, unlike those in most of the HH novels.The one thing that's better than the Honor Harrington series is that Drake keeps his books to 500-550 pages instead of Weber's 700 and counting (with a lot of padding). When considering Drake's books up to now, I very much preferred the Hammer's Slammers books. These, for me, are certainly among the best military sci-fi that I have ever read."
5,Off the Chain Hot,"This cd single is great. The best mix is the radio edit (the single version of the song). It's a shame ""How Many"" is not getting the airplay it deserves, however, it is a Top 10 hit peaking at #6 on the Hot Dance/Club Play Chart. Taylor gives a great show-stopping vocal proformance too. The other mixes all create a new sound of the song without altering it too much. Great 2 CD single! Keep up the good work Taylor Dayne!"
4,Dancefloor Diva is back!,Wow! 2 CD's of great club music. I've always liked Taylor Dayne's voice and her music. This one is great track. The best mix on this maxi is Tony Moran's original version. My other favourite is Lifestylus Deep & Heavy Mix.How Many? Too many... Somehow there aren't any mixes that would really make it.. most of them are just too long and too boring.
3,Soap,It's helping a little but takes more time than I expected. Trying to get past the smell which is garlicky! That's the big setback. Am now using Neem Oil shampoo which is much better.
2,Cleansing bar.,"This was not helpful to my irritated skin at all. I felt dirtier after I showered than before I got in the shower. Although it came properly packaged, and was expediently shipped. I will not buy this product."
4,"Solid Performer, Clean look","This is a high quality product that has excellent features, fits well in a professional office. APC's newer models look a little to bizarre for my taste."
5,Tarot of White Cats,"A charming deck, based closely upon the imagery of the Waite deck, and hence, very useable as a reading deck. The cat images are captivating in their colors, detail and integrity of execution, giving this deck not only better than average aesthetics, but also a very friendly and accessible feeling. A good deck to use if you want to win over someone who thinks of the tarot as threatening or evil. I've only had mine a day, and it is already one of my favorites!"
3,"A Good Starter Book, But Be Careful","Here is a book that is excellent for one wanting to start studying more in depth the MANY doctrines of the Bible. We often forget how many major doctrines there are. I personally have found approximately 50 doctrines in the Bible related to salvation alone. Mr. Lockyer does a great job and will get you started, expanding your mind beyond the ""milk"" theology in which so many Christians remain. But be careful. He bought into the very young doctrines of premillennialism and dispensationalism, so you will find his doctrinal explanations as related to eschatology to be ""newspaper"" theology rather than biblical theology."
4,Overtaken by Events,"Written by a reporter, one cannot expect the detachment a historian would bring to this theme. In today's Russia, events move very fast indeed. Some of the people the author writes about are no longer near the seat of power while others, whom he does not mention, now make policy. I would have wished for a more intense study of modern Russian society, including emigrants to US, to Germany, etc.Unfortunately, as the months go by, the book will be outdated. This is a pity, after all the effort the author brought to it."
3,"Worked great, for a couple years","I've had this mouse for 2 or 3 years now, I don't remember exactly when I got it. It has worked wonderfully all this time, but just recently I've had problems when trying to click and select something or click and drag. My text would de-select half-way through without me letting go of a button or anything, I thought it was a problem with my computer. As it turns out, my mouse is dying. About 20% of the time I try to click, it fails to register a click with the computer and nothing happens. This is very annoying to say the least. My scroll wheel also has a position where it is loose, if I scroll down a page and stop in that exact position, then even a slight touch of the wheel will cause it to scroll again. I'm going to spend about twice as much and upgrade to a Logitech MX 518, it has a long standing reputation as a great mouse."
5,Five Stars,"Every time I listen to this album it gets me excited. It's one of my favorite blues records because it never gets dull. It really deserves five stars. The horn section is great and Mr. Rush's performance speaks for itself. Also for fans of Duane Allman, it's interesting to listen to him play rhythym guitar on this one. A great pick."
4,Nuggets,"There are some great moments on this album: Feel So Bad, Gambler's Blues, Reap What You Sow. There's also so cheese thanks to Bloomfield and Graventies saddling Otis with Me, My Old Lady, and Working Man. The better cuts are top shelf. Enjoy them and grit your teeth on the others."
2,Below Expectations,"I've purchased a custom fit FIA bug screen in the past and was very happy with it. It was well made of quality materials. I ordered the FIA universal bug screen because I wanted some of the same screen mesh that my old one had. When I got it, all it consisted of was cheap fiberglass sreening, some crimped-on grommets, some small hooks and cord that could be found in any hardware store. I was expecting something a little better from FIA, not the hardware store junk I got."
3,Cheap,"You get what you paid for, it does work but you have to make sure you double tie the bunggy cords for it to stay in place."
5,Cuisinart Dough Blade,what can I say about a DOUGH BLADE??? It works! Just be sure you get the one that fits YOUR model...
4,Good replacement,"We bought this to replace a slicer that was about 20 years old. This was good for slicing Canadian bacon, pepperoni and roast."
3,Slicer,"Works well but must adjust thickness often because it moves. Also , difficult to clean. Not sure if any part is submersible."
3,The Beet Fields,"A great story of the coming of age of a 16 year old boy, after running away from home, having to work in beet fields, being a farm hand, losing all his money, having an unfortunate hitchhiking experience, meeting a lonely woman and finally ending up as a hired hand in a carnival and becoming a man."
3,Adrenal Fatigue,Good book but written rather naively will be helpful to the lay person but needs more depth for the health practitioner as this disorder is pandemic within our culture and is the underlying cause of many other disorders pandemic in our society.
2,Adrenal Fatigue review,Got the book not what its cracked up to be...My doctor recommended it I am taking it to their office and sharing it. There is some good vitamin info. in this publication but mostly a very dull read! Even though I was very interested in the subject matter. I wouldn't get it again if I knew what I now Know!!don't buy is my recommendation!
5,A must have!,"Fantastic book covers all of the area's with a basic understanding approach, some parts covered in detail. I certainly found my feet in the road to success in recovering and I recommend this book to everyone as a natural way of curing your precious adrenal glands."
4,Doctor recommended for a truly common disorder,"When I was first told about Adrenal Fatigue I was aghast that I had never heard of it. In my Psychiatric practice this disorder is rampant and often confused with Major Depression and Anxiety Disorder. This is a very reader friendly book, a bit too cutesy at times but that actually makes it easy to see yourself easily. Unless you go to a Functional or Anti-Aging Doctor this will be overlooked, and it can't realistically be diagnosed by blood tests (you need saliva testing over the course of a day). Even without a true diagnosis, you can use this book to help you understand strees in your life. I especially like some of the stress reduction exercises and the dietary recommendations."
5,Frustration Ended,"I until I read this book, I didn't know enough about hypothyrodism. Now I feel knowledgeable and I understand a lot of my frustration over the past many years as I have sought for answers. I bought this particular copy and sent it to my daughter in New York. If you have hypothyrodism, chances are that your children may also suffer from the condition. My hypothyrodism was the beginning of my adrenal fatigue. I work with a formulary pharmachist who is helping me deal with my adrenal fatigue with the aid of my medical doctor. My pharmachist has helped me understand that the endocrine system is like a symphony, each hormone needs to be working supporting the other major players."
3,Okay...but not what I hoped for,"My doctor diagnosed me with adrenal fatigue based on the saliva collection tests that are mentioned in this book. She recommended I read it, and has me on vitamins and the diet and rest and stress reduction methods mentioned in this book.The book is a collection of anecdotal stories about other people's experiences, not much clinical evidence or data supported by studies or facts. It does have some good points, but I was able to read it and do all the written exercises in just a few hours, and it didn't give me any more detail than the doctor's appointment did.That being said, it is helpful if you don't have a supportive doctor. I totally lucked out with mine. She spent over an hour with me, going over specific diet, rest, vitamin, exercise and relaxation techniques with me.I gave the book to the doctors office. Not that great in my opinion."
4,Adrenal Fatigue,My wife bought the book and read it and then started buying copies for her friends. Can't get a much better recommendation than that!
2,Not used at all,I realize that each child is different about what they like--so this review is about deceptive advertising. They said that these pieces were completely interchangeable and could be reconfigured in many different ways. That is why I spent $40 for this one instead of $10-$15 for other options. They DON'T go together in many different ways--and still have the roads match up. Very frustrating for my 3-year-old. He doesn't seem interested at all in this toy.
2,Bad Vampire Books,"I'm giving this book a 2 because the sex in it is great. Other then that, I find myself not even emotionally drawn to any character at all. They lack feeling, substance, and personality. The Fantasy element is a little over the top for my taste. I find it very difficult to believe that when captured, the two main characters were transported into a 5 star resort type of prison, and then dressed in hot underwear. Eh not believable. I just couldn't get into something that was basically designed to be a poor excuse for some semi-vampire porn. If that's what your cup of tea is this book is great, I on the other hand need an actual plot line."
2,"Not anything like ""Janes Warlord""","Loved ""Janes Warlord"" and bought this book brand new thinking I really like this author's writing style---YUK! This book was not very good--save you money and buy it used if you have to read it!"
2,A little better than Jane's Warlord,This is a little better but no gold ring from me. If you want to read great sexy paranomal stories; then may I suggest Sherilyn Kenyon....Her stories are outstanding.
1,Too many creatures/characters - Not Romance!,"This book had too many characters (witches, vampires, unicorns, tinkerbell, demons, etc) - it was hard to keep track of who was who and who was what and the ""power"" that they had. The story was all very strange. It was definitely not romance - perhaps should be called just erotica. The story plot was strange. Thankfully I only bought the one book by the author to try it out - I won't be buying anymore."
3,My first Angela Knight book,"I liked the overall plot of this book. The only problem I had with the book was the required sex scenes in which a Vampire must turn a Latent after three obligatory sexual encounters. I could have done with less sex and more plot, but all in all it was entertaining and I will probably read the next in the series."
5,Really Neat!!!,This is a pretty neat item. I got it for a Christmas gift. We will see how he likes it. I received the item timely. Thanks for the order.
1,switch to a more versitile product,"Well I used the fishing line spooling station for a good while, I got it because of the portability which it is however its just doesn't meet what I found in another much better product called a Spoolin Buddy which is also portable and holds all of my line up to 15 spools!!! and is still light to carry, stores in my boat or truck while Im fishing! You can find the Spoolin Buddy fishing Line spooling station at [...]"
3,Not so good,Broke after about a month filling all my reels with line this spring.This product really will let you down fast.
2,Not so good,It was very badly packed one rubber foot was missing and one tensioner broke after I was spooling second reel so I don`t recommend this item to anyone
3,to [Help me find this song/title] ->,"Hey Melissa, I was trying to figure that out myself. I am certain that it is a Jamiroquai song. I don't know much about them but I recognized the bloke's voice..."
4,An amazing look at the other side,"Since we live in the West, we get the West's version of history. Halim Barakat, a lebbonese christian offers us an amazing fictional look at the Six Days War that not only crystilizes non-Israeli sentiment on the issue, but created a form of Arabic revolutionary literature when first published. Barakat's work is persuasive, fiery prose, intercutting several characters but mainly concerning itself with Ramzy (or ""symbol"") his autobiographical main character. This book is one of the more powerful 180 pages I've read, and the introduction by Edward Said is really great. The book occasionally lurches toward self indulgence, but considering that Barakat is not a novelist by trade, I think this is excusable. By this book. Read it. Change your mode of thought."
1,don't buy,"When you order from fluke you expect the best ""WRONG"" Its been a while since i bought these and did not leave any kind or review until amazon e-mailed me today and showed me what i had bought through them previously. I am an electrician and i use my meter often. I ordered these because of the bed of nails. When i got these leads i plugged them into my Fluke 87 meter selected the ohms scale and touched the leads togather. They read OPEN. When i got to looking Fluke had crimped the positive lead so hard onto the 90 degree male prong that connects to the meter they cut the wire completly into. I had to buy another male prong to fix them. Now i have a 90 degree neg prong and a straight pos prong going to the meter. Would not buy this item if i was you"
1,Not worth the money,Upon opining the box the shield was already broken! not worth the money! shows not to by things that are on a online site!
2,What is that song,"One song that I personally wanted on it was the song that played when Schneider and Faris (Spence and April) walked into the prom. It started up right after the scene where the girl found the matchbook in the alley. Does anyone know the name of it? It went something like this ""ooh eh hey hey hey heeey, oh pretty pretty child, What What, ooh eh.... oh pretty pretty flower, What What, What do i have to say to get inside girl, What do I have to say.""I'd appreciate if anyone could tell me this song."
3,look for a song,"I am looking for a song & I 'm not sure that it is on the soundtrack album.This track is played when Jessica goes home - she's wearing sunglasses - puts her bag down, takes a basket ball and makes a 3-points shoot. Can anyone help me to find the name of this song.Thank you."
4,Anyone Know This Song??,"The soundtrack could've been SO much better with some of the dance/techno music that was in the movie. Anyway, does anyone know the artist/title of the song when Rob Schneider was walking/dancing down the steps into the club? Something like, ""when I rock like this, rock like this, rock like this, it's rhythm."" Ring a bell for anyone? I'd love to know what it is."
4,the title for the dance song..,"I think the dance song for the club is called, AM to PM by Christina Milian."
3,whats the song,"ok, there are 4 songs that play in the club scene. the first one is the ""rock like this"" one when hes walking down the stairs, the 3rd one when hes dancing with Bianca is Am to pm by Christina Milian, and the 4th one is shake ya as* by mystikal. but whats the second song during the club scene. the one that shows the dj spinning, and its playing while the girls are talking about the cute boys."
4,Great Tom Johnston Era Compilation,"But, please tell me, who comes with the idea to make this horrible cd-covers?. Too cheap to get real artists to make a special box set?. Same happened with Zeppelin, and BeachBoys. Anyway, good times."
1,TacTrap is dangerous for birds,Within less than one hour of installing our new Skeetervac the only thing we had caught was a poor songbird! After spending hours trying to free the bird we ended up finding a wildlife rehabilitator who said this type of incident is very common and deadly for birds. The TacTrap is optional - if you have any birds in your area please don't use it! I wanted to let others know about our experience so that it won't happen again.

5,Great Book,I purchased this book as a Christmas present for my son-inlaw. The book arrived in great condition. As my son-inlaw loves Harleys he liked the book a lot.
5,better than i expected,"this cd is all that, i definitely recommend you go get it, you won't be disapointed, ghostface is what's considered real hip hop, so while these little kids out here are stuck on laffy taffy, get ya mind right and cop 5 star albumtop 5whip me with a strapbe easymommathe champthree bricks"
1,"4 1/2 Stars, Are you kidding me? This sucks...","Granted I'd take this over 50 Cent any day. But comparing apples to apples this is another album in the downward slide of the Wu-Tang Clan. The last impressive album from the Wu group since RZA stop producing was GZAs' Legend of Liquid Swords and Ghost's' Supreme Clientele. The production on this album stinks. Lyrics are decent but unimaginative. I don't know what's gotten into the Wu since Wu-Tang Forever but someone needs to tell them what the big league coaches tell the rookies; ""Just keep doing what got you here"". Too many artists forget that. I don't know how these guys could listen to their super successful early albums then listen to this in the studio and think ""yeah, the Wu fans will dig this""."
4,"A good, solid review of probability and statistics basics.","This book is an excellent mind-jogger for those of you that have forgotten some of the basics. It is written in plain english, not statistical-ese, and covers the following subjects: review of mathematics for statistics, organizing data, measures of central tendency and dispersion, probability and probability distributions, sampling theory, large-sample and small-sample inferential statistics, binomial proportion, analysis of variance, chi-square tests, linear regression, and some nonparametric tests. While it does not go into advanced techniques such as multiple regression, logistic regression, survival analysese, and others, it does comprehensively review the basic statistical tests needed to understand the higher order methods. A good reference guide."
2,To hard to learn.,This unit has so many features and they are all tied into the same functions of other functions. This would be great for someone with cable but not Directv. It wont run any set top box's. If you could disable some of the features it could be easy to work.
1,Customer Service ???????,"I spent a total of over 3 hours on the phone with their tech support, and found that I knew more about the machine than they did. Three different calls for three different problems yielded no results from tech support. I fiddled around with remote control until I stumbled across my own fixes. One rep even told me that the unit was a new product line and he couldn't help me. The average idiot such as myself would have assumed they train their tech reps on their own products. How stupid of me to make such a ludicrus assumption. Would have given it four stars if I didn't factor in tech support."
1,Beware!!!!,"I purchased my HDRW720/17 on 5/2/06 from Amazon. It is now 6/30/05 and the unit is still not working properly. It frequently crashes and shutdowns. I have had 6 tickets open with Philips support. They keep telling me to upgrade to the latest firmware on their website and I did BUT ...it did not not fix issues. I just RMAed it back to repair and got it back and the tech claimed he upgraded my firmware to CF2.6 (daaaa, this is old) and I already had the latest software CF3.2 installed on it when i UPSed it back to Philips repair depot. I talked to tech support again today, they are mailing me a new CD with CF3.2 to load, it going to take 7 - 10 business days. I have gone past the point of being able to return it to Amazon. Philips will not replace the unit, only have you UPS it to a repair depot. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT!!!!!!!!!!"
2,I want one that works,This is a great idea if it would work better. Is there a better model out there?
1,Won't buy again,"Have ordered this product numerous times from Bass Pro. It works and is worth the money. But thought I would save some money and buy the same product through Amazon.. Big big mistake. When I opened the box the first thing I noticed is it wasn't the same can as avertised, the can in the advertisement on the web was green and the can that was delivered was yellow which made me wonder. Don't get me wrong, the chemical does work. The problem is that I bought 6 cans and all 6 wasted more out of the can where the nozzle goes into the can than comes out of the spray tip. Pours out of the can like a faucet drip. Don't really know if this is really a sawyer product or a knock off. I do know that I ordered more from bass pro and it was what was advertised and sprayed just fine without any waste. Buy Cabelas or Bass Pro, the cost isn't that much more"
5,Great Movie,This is one of my favorite Christmas movies - love it.It would be helpful if it had been designated as widescreen or full screen.
2,My cats do not approve,"My cats go wild for the small fur mice, and I assumed it would be much the same with these foam ones. But cats are particular creatures and the cat engineering specialist that designed these did not do enough research into the likes and dislikes of kittens. The mice's hard texture turns my kitties off, they don not like to bite them. The shape is probably also not realistic enough, and although the these toys tumble well across a hardwood floor, my Misha and Kabanos have both decidedly said NO to the soft bite mice."
5,Best songs!,The huggabug club is the best tv show for little kids. Even though I'm eleven I love the huggabug club. There songs are fantastic! i give the two thumbs up way way up!!! I love the huggabug club!
1,A nice work of fiction,"This book is rife with statistical fiction, most of which springs from the author's huge bias against adoption. According to Ms. Carangelo she is a birthmother whose son was stolen from her for adoption as well as the mother of a child supposedly stolen and switched with a stillborn infant. As bizarre as those stories are, they more closely resemble the truth than any of these so-called 'statistics'."
2,Not for people who actually need to learn Word programming,"As mentioned in another review, I thought the book lacked enough useful exercises to practice Word programming. I bought this book because I couldn't find any others at the time specifically addressing Word programming and in the end, I had to search for another book to supplment it. I found it much more useful as a reference than as a learning tool."
1,Be Careful of Mr. Roman.,"this book is exactly the same as a book by Steven Roman titled ""Word Macros"" ISBN 1-56592-524-6. It is word for word and page for page the same. I purchased both books and got cheated."
2,What's the point?,"I don't get it. What's the appeal of this CD? As far as I know, there are recordings widely available by an immensely talented band which has already performed every single Beatles song: THE BEATLES!Save your money and opt for ""1,"" which is practically a catalog of singable, classic Beatles songs by the originals. My 5-year-old loves to sing along with the songs and dance to them, but she turns up her nose at the ""kid's versions"" because she has the real thing, which simply cannot be beat.The only reason I gave this CD two stars instead of 1 is that the Raffi version of Octopus' Garden is awful cute. If your kid is a Raffi fan, buy the song by itself in mp3 format. Otherwise, skip the schlock."
2,"Go For the ""Real"" Beatles Albums.","We received this as a very kind gift when our girl was born last year. We set it aside until she was ready to sway and jump to the rhythm. As it turns out, she likes the actual Beatles albums far better. Let's face it. There are few more exquisitely crafted and danceable pop records than the Beatles early works. Hard to imagine the well-intentioned efforts of Mr Berine Steinberg and Eric Bibb topping the work of Misters Lennon and McCartney. This is a ""cute"" CD -- but why buy a pale imitation when the real thing is right on the shelf, and is in fact less expensive."
2,"BIG,BAD,BABBLIN' BOB SPEAKS","The album's not too bad, but Ol' Bob yearns for the songs they left out. Wouldn't it be cute to hear a baby sing ""Tomarrow Never Knows"" or the lovely, droning ""Blue Jay Way""? Hey, why stop there? What about the solo stuff? Hows 'bout hearin' little ""Timmy"" singin' Lennons ""My Mommy's Dead""? Hows 'bout Lennons ""Women is the Ni**er of the World""? C'mon all you self involved, self important snot-nose wiping soccer moms! 20 years from now your grandchildren will be listening to ""Marilyn Manson for Babies"". But for now, enjoy this baby-burpin' masterpiece. It, like most children, isn't so bad once you get past the smell."
2,"It Ain't Great, But...","While I was not overly fond of this, it is infinitely better than toddler music which is irritating and gets old very fast. As another reviewer noted, it ain't great, but I, too will take this over that darn ""Farmer in the Dell"" and that equally tired ""On Top of Old Smokey"" and others of that ilk.It's best to introduce young listeners to the REAL Beatles. The Beatles are the world's greatest band!"
2,Beatles,Not a great CD. I had high hopes for this one but their choice of songs was not great. Really boring for a 2 year old to listen to
4,Not Just for Kids,"All though this recording was made with kids in mind, it is something to be enjoyed by everyone. The songs lift your heart and spirits and brings you back to the age on innocence: something very much needed in these stressful times. This CD makes a great gift for both kids and kids at heart!"
3,To Repeat: It's for KIDS!,"I'm sure there are plenty of Beatles fans who find a work like this appalling, but my 17-month-old is enjoying this CD immensely. Even my husband (who is old enough to have actually *seen* the Beatles) has come around...though he maintains that our son will be listening to ""the real thing"" soon.What I like about this is that they have included a lot of ""child-safe"" Beatles tunes in one place (helpful); my son likes the children's voices. We both enjoy Octopus's Garden--sung by (gulp) Raffi. Their version of Here Comes the Sun is quite lovely, really. Dear Prudence is pretty awful (that's what the ""skip"" button is for, folks!), but overall my son thoroughly enjoys listening and dancing to it--which is what it's all about, after all."
1,BABIES DESTROY THE BEATLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ok, let me just ask what were they thinking when they made this CD? If you want to play the beatles for your child, then play the Beatles, not these high-pitched little rodents. What would Paul McCartney say if he found out that Blackbird was being covered by some little kid who didn't even know what that song really meant. Go buy Rubber Soul or something. If you dont want your kid to hear a certin song, there's this great little button that lets you skip from song to song. Maybe you should try it some time. If someday when your son/ daughter is older and you are driving them somewhere and Here Comes The Sun comes on the radio, Do you really want them to say ""Hey, who are these guys with the funny accents singing, they're not the Beatles?'' *breathes* Ok, I'm through. Peace and Love"
1,Hated It. Over It.,"Very disappointed in the cd. It sounds NOTHING like the Beatles and the songs are ruined, in my humble opinion. Frustrated that I bought this."
3,"Softer, but not sure if really for children?","The packaging and such feel like the product is intended for a child, but I didn't even know kids wore fragrance. I like it, but not as much as ""Touch"". I decided to keep the product and it has grown on me. If nothing else, it's somewhat of an exclusive, so you won't smell like everyone else. Enjoy"
1,BAAAAAAD,"I am normally a big fan of DC's recent line of animated movies, but this one was just bad. Jumping from one story to the next may work in print, especially with a month between issues, but it makes for horrible plot structure for a movie. I kept waiting for something to tie it all together (besides the loose thread of Superman dying), but it never came. I consider this one a swing and a miss."
2,Are the 2 DVD SE even worth it???,I would recomend not picking up this Special Edition since Technically it is only one Featurette and a pairof Eps of Superman.Not even the commentary track is on this just the one little handout of an extra... two disks for this?just get the single version or upgrade to BR for the extras... these guys are wasting our money withthese DVD S.E. just cram one disk with what you can its a 75 min movie.
3,Copy protection annoyance,"The video itself is first rate but my rating is for the DVD itself. I have a first generation PS2 that I use as my DVD player and the copy protection on the disc prevents the movie from playing in my primary DVD player. I was able to watch it through my computer but I generally don't like watching movies through my computer. I also bought ""Toy Story 3"" and ""Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths"" and both played perfectly.Warner Bros. and the other studios are only making it harder for people who buy legitimate copies to fully enjoy their purchases. People who bootleg movies have access to working around the copyright protection given that the Internet is online. If I had known beforehand, I would have not bought this DVD despite the quality story-telling and animation. I'm actually considering returning it."
3,Superman is hard to write for--- and they made this interesting,"I always found Superman to be dull, but kinda got into these straight to DVD BATMAN and others with the interesting plots and being able to break the Saturday Morning Television ''rules'' regarding language, violence, etc. I really wish there were more to choose from. This was a pretty solid flick that found interesting ways to challenge and use the Superman character that WORKED."
1,Read the Trade Paperback - Do Not Buy The DVD,"Out of all of the DC animated features, All Star Superman is my least favorite. I am a big fan of Grant Morrison, writer of Marvel's New X-Men and DC's Final Night as well as All Star Superman and most of his stories or story lines are layered, quite involved and develop over time. It was not a good idea to compress Morrison's 12 issue maxi-series that ran for almost 3 years into a movie. Watching this movie you miss out on a lot UNLESS you have already read the series. 76 minutes is no where near enough time to even grasp this new vision of Superman. Don't buy the DVD, read the trade paperback because unless you already read it or you have been prepared by a comic book fan, you may find yourself bored, uninterested, lost or compelled to wrap the DVD back up in its original packaging as to try to get a full refund."
2,To Much for one movie,"This movie had way to much going on. It lacked the focus of the comics, graphic novel or other movies. This is by far one of the worst DC movies made. It may be that they tried to sum up a story in 74mins. But this movie is at best a rental via Amazon. Animation was great I didn't like all the character designs but Lex in Green Superman in red blue and yellow was fine. The writer Dwayne McDuffie and director Sam Liu did what no villain could ever have done killed Superman."
1,don't buy this movie,supers costum was dumb and the art work stinked and the ending of this movie sucked i can't beleave that dc would let some one do this movie
4,Idealized Superman,"This is Clark Kent at his finest! Based on Grant Morrison's fantastic 12 issue run, All Star Superman is an excellent entry into the DC Animated Universe. Solid voice acting and animation to boot."
3,it's okay,"i thought it will be a little bit bigger than how it is , because i wanted to use it for my hot stone warmer , it looks bigger than how it is"
3,Well described and presented.,The rack was well described so there were no real surprises. I would like to see a version that could be put in a dishwasher.
3,It is almost impossible to put together,"The castle itself is amazing. The girls (3 and 5) play with it often. HOWEVER and I really do mean however, this was the one of the hardest things to put together that I have encountered. I called Papo and tried to get better directions but they did not return my calls. It has no instructions yet a series of diagrams. The parts are not labeled so it is almost impossible to figure out which piece is which. Once it is together we love the castle but getting their took three hours.[my wife left this review]"
1,Disappointing,"Seriously disappointed in the amount of season video... started out great, talking about the first few games in a nice overview, and then we jumped like three months. Huh??I wanted this to be my archive of a great season, and it's nothing more than a slapped-together money-grab."
2,b-hawks,We were disappointed in this purchase. The video content was uninspiring and rather flat considering the exciting year that the Blackhawks had. Would not recommend. Buy the book instead.
1,Wherre is it?,What's the hold up on this item? Is it ever going to ship? Are you hoping I'll cancel my order?
4,Invasion from the Planet of the Cows,"I heard that Dan Greenburg was writing a new series. After reading the Zack Files, which is about a boy who has science-fiction adventures. I was curious about what Maximum Boy was going to be like.Then I read Invasion from the Planet of the Cows.The plot is about cows coming from outer space. They try to invade Earth. Maximum Boy goes right into action.My favorite character is Tiffany (Maximum Boy's sister)because she makes me laugh. I like to laugh when Tiffany has a bad attitude. The difference between Zack Files and Maximum Boy is that Maximum Boy is a super hero and Zack is just a boy who has lots of adventures.Both books are science-fiction.I recommend the Maximum Boy series to anyone who likes anyone who likes super heroes and I recommend Zack Files to anyone who likes to have adventures.Joanna Gustek, age 9"
2,They should be giving this one away free,"This was kind of boring, a better verbal description by the sellers would be helpful on products like this. Less than expected."
1,Not Up To Par!,This book should be used as firewood not to entertain or educate kids. How did the author get it published.
3,O.k.,"I am reading this series in order and liked this less than 'On what grounds' & 'Through the Grinder'. I really enjoyed the 1st 2 in the series, just didn't like this one as much. It was o.k. I'll read on to the next one. The characters are enjoyable in the series."
2,latte trouble,"Loved the coffee recipes, but too much side info. I just want a good mystery, without all the thoughts, of EVERY character in the novel. thanks."
2,"ho-hum beginning, but picks up speed down the road","The beginning was boring to me because there were too many characters and too much activity. The pace did slow down eventually and I found it to be a more relaxing read as time went on. As usual with this series, the mystery line was good, but way too much extraneous info along the way. I found myself skipping a lot of the unnecessary descriptions. If you're interested in NY City history and lots of details about certain areas and buildings, you'll probably like all the nonessential information."
4,Stylish and efficient!,"I recieved this as a babyshower gift and it's a great buy. The one I recieved came in pink and grey, and I think the company does a great job in making the carriers stylish for mom and baby. Getting to the main point though, my baby loves sitting there and it's very efficient because I can get a lot more done when I'm wearing it. I even thought that my daughter would think it was uncomfortable, but she doens't complain one bit. The only downside I would say it has is trying to figure out exactly how to adjust the straps so that the baby will be snug. Before the first time I wore it, I had to adjust so many straps to get it just right. Since then though, it's been just fine."
2,Too Big,"I received this as a shower gift. After my son was born, I tried putting him into this when he was a month old. This was too big for him. He screamed both time my husband and I tried to get him into it and when we got him in, it was too large for him. My husband and I both a harder time getting him into this carrier. I definitely would not recommend this carrier if your child is on the smaller size."
2,Not That Interesting...,"You would think that with a title like Murder on a Girls' Night Out: A Southern Sisters Mystery, this story would be more interesting. Unfortunately, it's not. It starts fairly quickly with the actual murder occurring within the first few pages of the book. The problem is that it feels like finding the murderer was an afterthought. A slew of inconsequential characters were introduced into the story that didn't seem to have any bearing on the story, except to distract you from the real murderer. This could have been an effective technique if the climax and resolution of the book weren't literally shoved into the last few chapters. Without giving away the book, I thought the lead up to finding the killer was really weak. The dialogue was trite and phony and my entire book club gave it a big thumbs down."
5,Best of the world sounds,"I heard this CD when I was working at th SF Zoo and it really put me and the other patrons ready to discover the world. The music and sounds from around the world had something for everyone, even the animals. I am giving this a gifts to my jazz friends and family who I am sure will be playing this as much as I do and as loudly as I do"
1,Not a good keyboard and mouse,"I have had several previous versions of this keyboard and mouse and like them very much. The reviews on this one said there are performance problems with it, but I decided to try it anyway as I had seen similar reports on the previous versions. Well, this time I was wrong and there are serious problems with delays on both the keyboard and mouse. I would return the set, but the set is at a vacation house and I will not be going back there in time to return the keyboard. I know it is the hardware as the version of software drivers is the same for this one as for the previous versions. I am betting that when I take an older keyboard (3000) and swap it out with the new one the performance problems will go away, but I won't know for sure until I am able to do so. I join the crowd that says don't buy this keyboard and mouse."
4,A wonderful chance to talk with my kids,"My children (4 & 6) really enjoyed this. The claymation is extremely creative and offer lots of funny images. While some adults may find the rhyme a bit tiresome, my kids got really into it and laughed a lot. It was also a wonderful chance to discuss with my kids notions of confidence, responsibility, and faith. I should also note that for those who are wondering if this is suited only for Christians, as a Jew I can assure you there were no issues. My only caveat (and I hate to spoil this for anyone)--SPOILER ALERT--instead of David killing the giant, getting hit in the head makes him turn into a nice person. I thought this a bit of a copout, but not so much as to make me dislike this DVD."
3,A nice family DVD showcasing some awesome claymation!,"Davie & Golimyr is a DVD release from Anchor Bay/Starz productions. The story is a new take on the old biblical tale of David and Goliath. Instead of boring old computer animation, the filmmakers used claymation and some very nifty camerawork. This new version breathes life into the often told story of good triumphing over evil. Davie is young and idealistic kid who tries to topple the giant Golimyr. But his first attempt ends in utter failure and embarrassment. So, he works hard to try and best the goliath with the help of Chops his faithful sidekick and belief in himself to save the day. But will it be enough?The DVD is real bare bones, except for some previews for other kid friendly programs. Davie & Golimyr is presented in full-frame and in 2.0 English soundtrack. If you're a fan of family friendly entertainment or if you love claymation, then this DVD is just for you!"
4,The Grandsons Say...,"I got this video for my two grandsons, ages 3 and 8, so I think that I'll just pass on to you what they said about the movie.My 8 year old grandson said that he like the movie, especially because ""it was weird."" He said the animation was different and that the characters ""spoke in poetry.""My 3 year old grandson simply loved it. The movie kept him entertained the entire time and he occasionally voiced his approval by laughing or yelling at the screen. He like the movie so much that literally as soon as the video ended he was begging to watch it again.It's a good story, suitable for kids of all ages."
2,The first failure in the DC DVD animated movies,"Was to short and they just put extra stuff that the other DVDs already had like Hex and the Spirit. The story could have been about 40 minutes more and went into how Billy got where he was. It had more holes in it than swiss cheese and the bad guy was robbed of any real evil actions. Do not rent, do not buy, get it on Netflix then thank me for saving you the money. Did I mention the Blu ray really did not have any good extras and WB does not even let you put it on your ipod you get this stupid digital program and have to be connected on your laptop to the web."
2,Not Worth Buying,"Superman/Shazam: The Return of Black Adam is only around 45 minutes long, maybe shorter. Also the story is very childlike and not very interesting. Also Black Adam dies at the end, hopes...SPOILER ALERT.This ""film"" does include The Spectre, Jonah Hex, and Green Arrow shorts. But if your like me you owe these already.I watched Superman/Shazam on Youtube, may still be posted there.I would only buy this for 2.99 if I ever saw this for sale at that price, simply because I am a completist. At the current price though, forget it. DC won't be getting my money on this one.-You have been warned."
2,Not worth $20,The Shazam/Superman story is only 23 minutes long and isn't anything special.As origin stories go it's pretty weak.Worth a rental only.
3,Not enough,"I WANT to buy this but I already have all the DC movies that these shorts are on.And if Green Arrow will be on Apocalypse, that's just the nail in the coffin.For other people like me that have the movies, the only reason for buying this is for the Black Adam short...which is essentially paying all this money for a 5 or 6 minute bit.I do't want to say it's a ripoff, I just hope there's more to the DVD than this."
4,The listed run time is wrong,"The Amazon listed run time is 22 minutes, but by zooming in on the image of the back of the DVD it says the run time is 63 minutes."
2,"Misleading, Short, Not Worth It","I don't know what more to say. If I haven't stopped you thus far, you might as well just RENT it and experience it for yourself. Notice I said RENT, in capitals. What only redeems this hardly cheap attempt at making money off loyal fans, is the short films that are attached. Some real quality stories in those shorts. Beyond that... really you shouldn't waste your time. I felt like I did."
3,Amazon please confirm the run time,i was about to click buy when i noticed the run time for this short is 22 minutes...... A dollar a minute let's be a little rational. I will wait a few months and see the price drop by half. If this is an error please let me know.
2,Yeah....so not buying this...,"I'm all about supporting DC animated films. But yeahhhhhhhhhh. This is a rip off. I'll definitely be watching this a different way.I own all the shorts, so theres no point for me to buy another Blu Ray with them in it,just have a 22 min movie.I must say, this is a stupid move on DC's part. They are spending money on manufacturing the Blu Ray/ DVD's for this, but I highly doubt they'll be selling much, especially with the face that its so easily downloadable nowadays.Sorry DC, but I won't be buying this one. I'll definitely will be buying Superman/Batman: Apocalypse though!"
1,Not for kids at all IGNORE RATING,Not for kids at all it should be rated Pg 13 or R for some of the movies. Way to violent and creepy for any kid. The first one with superman is ok for kids 8 and up but the other three especially the 2nd and 4th should be rated R. Save your money for a more kid friendly movie.
1,I WILL NEVER BUY AN HP INKJET MFP AGAIN,"This unit has not worked correctly from day one. I could not print, fax or scan without getting the annoying ""all lights blinking"" error.While I have always had good exprience with HP's laser printers in the workplace, I will never again trust HP with an inkjet product."
1,All in one MALFUNCTION device.,"Machine is truly amazing in number of ways it can frustrate, malfunction and annoy. Is not consistently recognized. Scans only if you are lucky. Copies OK, so long as you don't mind paying a fortune for ink. Most creative failure is the blinking light show and error message you get after sending each fax. All faxes take at least two phone calls. One to send the fax (provided it actually goes through) and a second to call the recipient to find out if the fax actually went through. Read the rest of the reviews for more horror stories on this monster."
4,Nice Sweatshirt,I really like this sweatshirt. It's well made but a lighter material when you don't need a heavy one. So it works well when you want to add layers. I purchased another one from Cabela's and this one is higher quality. It has better elastic in the waist and sleeves. The zipper is good but probably could be better. And you have to be careful about pulling the draw string out of the hood. But I would buy another one again.
5,Mahler 9,"I find this to be an outstanding interpretation of the Mahler 9. Most of the criticism of this recording comes in the last movement which was criticized as being rushed. I don't think so, most conductors slowed this down too much. That said no recording is definitive and this is a fine reading. Check out the one by Bruno Madena too. Interesting interpretation."
4,"Delicious, but Small","The product is kind of deceiving, the bars are not as big as you think, but still very delicious! Yay"
2,Mars bar review,"These Mars bars are not the Mars bars I used to eat. They taste like Milky Ways. Very costly for what you get. If you are craving the taste of the original Mars bars, Walmart now carries them.(and the cost is SO much better)"
2,Boring Well Trodden Path,Just another screwed up guy turns killer. Why are there good ratings on this book? I found the writing quality very hum drum. I'm throwing my paperback copy into the fire this winter.
2,Huh?,"This would have been a great story, but the author doesn't seem to be able to keep on track. Events are discussed and then brought up two or three times again in the book as though they were happening for the first time in the story. Extremely disjointed with no thought flow. The reader is then inundated with page after page after page (at several points in the book) of technical ballistics evidence which I believe should have been kept at a minimum in order not to induce boredom. I have read over 750 true crime books in my life, but this is absolutely the first one that I did not finish reading. It was simply too confusing and frustrating to try to keep up with the author's train of thought. Great story subject, just not well written."
2,Great Subject...Poor Execution,"While there are many who feel it's not football if its not played indoors and for millions of dollars, I am inclined to prefer college football, particulary the Ivy League. The history of college football is the history of the Ivy League schools, and it is a riveting and fascinating history. Too bad that this book is so poorly written that it hard to find. It has its moments when you get lost in the history you're reading, but then you're awoken sharply by a mistake - no, not a factual mistake (although it has some of those) but simply a gramatical mistake, or a spelling mistake, or a word where it shouldn't be, or a word missing. Normally I wouldn't care, but the frequency with which I was annoyed by these mistakes was too much to overcome. The material is good, but the author and publisher bring it down."
5,Amr Diab = is The Best 4 Ever ...,Amr Diab - Allem Alby - is The Best Album in Year 2003 ... Amr Diab did it again with this album .. its really Greaaaaat ...Specialy - Habibi Ya Omry ... its really legend ....i like ur music Amr Diab ... from ( 7oss ) to the King of Song .
4,Nice Album for Amr Diab lovers,"I must admit that Amr Diab has a pretty fixed style, but I liked this album still."
5,Comic Mnemonics for Spanish Verbs,This book is a must for anyone learning Spanish who has problems remembering verbs tense.
1,These are NOT the songs you remember,"Just received this CD. These are NOT the Specials songs I remember. Oh sure, they have the same names, the same lyrics for teh most part, and the same beats at times, but these are remastered and re-envisioned. They are hollow examples of what the great songs were. Not one song on here sounds like the original Specials songs I grew up with and loved. THIS IS NOT A GREATEST HITS RECORD. This is more like a ""Alternative versions of The Specials hit songs"" record.very VERY disappointed that I spent $5, including shipping, on this item."
1,Try Again!,"I just listened to this performance on WETA-FM in Washington, D.C., not knowing who the conductor was until the end. Wow. The worst performance I have ever heard of this symphony. Dragging tempi, inner voices highlighted when they detract rather than add to the musical line, the orchestra slowing down in soft sections and speeding up on creschendi (just like an amature band conductor)--this awful performance has it all. For an infinitely better interpretation, I'd go with the Bruno Walter/Columbia Symphony Orchestra on CBS Classics--or if you're into blockbuster 1960's records, the Command Classics 35mm recording with Steinberg and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in the wonderful gatefold album."
1,Didn't last,I owned four different sets of NiMH AAs; this was the latest purchase and the first one to stop working. I do have decent chargers and never dropped them or anything. It actually ruined my day twice. Very disappointed.
1,"Lenmar Rechargeable Batteries are not reliable, often faulty","I purchased two ten packs of Lenmar batteries. Of the twenty batteries, only 4 would take a charge. I used 3 different chargers, an Energizer, LaCrosse, and a RipVan100. The LaCrosse is a high-end charger with diagnostics (can display voltage levels, etc., individually for each battery, it can also 'repair' batteries maximum capacities, etc. - so can the RipVan100)... None could charge the 16 faulty batteries. I sent both 10 packs back."
1,Not reliable product,"I bought 12 of 1000mAh Lenmar rechargeable batteries 2 years ago. They were great initially. However, they become useless soon after the 1-year warranty expired. Now, 9 out of 12 won't even hold a charge even though I only used them for 20 times or less. I won't ever buy another Lenmar battery."
4,2000 watt generator review,"Having bought 3 generators I must remark that the originalmodel was modified to include additional features and a slightlymore powerful engine. The Only problem I had with the 1st model was that it would shut off at times (on 2 different units) when there was no load. This did not occur in the improved model and in addition the newer model is equipped with a low oil level shut off sensor,2 oil ports,a built in fuel gauge and a better frame/vibration mount design. Also the improved model has different style controls and power sockets. The only problem I observed with the improved model is that the battery charging cable gauge is cheaper in quality and gauge. The new improved model seems to run slightly more quietly. All in All I am pleased with the performance although the peak wattage is less than desirable for heavy starup applications..BOB"
2,Worth what I paid for it - not much,"I got this thing as an insurance policy to run my refrigerator in the event of an extended power outage. With several hundred dollars worth of food at risk, I figure it could pay for itself one day, maybe. I don't think I will be using it much other than running a hedge trimmer in the back yard, 100 feet away from the house.I have run it with a small load and without a load. The engine will run steady for about 20 seconds then rev up and down for 20 seconds. It leaks oil. It doesn't start real easy. Everything about it looks cheap, cheap, cheap. I got what I paid for.It does not inspire a lot of confidence. If you plan on using it a lot, do yourself a favor and buy a quality device. I can't see this thing holding up under continuous use for any length of time."
1,run away,"I'd prefer ZERO stars. I'm ready to toss mine out. Ran poorly for a weekend trying to keep my sump pump going during hurricane Irene, but frequently stalled, and required regular manual control of the trottle. Pull cord sheared off. Spark plug wire and shield are cracked. UTTERLY unreliable and tempermental. Now it doesn't start. Scrap, after 2 weeks and perhaps 10 hours of service."
1,Poor Quality Control,"I ordered this due to a storm (Hurricane Sandy) It arrived Saturday afternoon, prior to the storm and all looked good. Today (Sunday, storm hits tomorrow) I got the generator out and filled it with oil and gas and tried to start it. It would not start. I check the fuel line, the on\off switch, and nothing works. I inspect the engine and find that the spark plug wire is broken. the part that attaches to the plug is in pieces and there is no way of attaching it. Now I have to figure a way of making this work during the storm and since it is an off name Chinese engine I don't even know where to get parts for it (not that I should have to get parts, but contacting the manufacturer will not help start this thing before the storm hits.)"
4,Good light weight generator,"I bought this generator for my boat to do night fishing. Very small but keeps my 1,000 watt light plua another 100 light lit for more than 3 hours on 1 1/4 gal of gasoline. Easy to set up, starts first time. Love it. Good price too compared elsewhere."
5,Finally!,"As a young fella who's only been into Billy Bragg for a few of years and missed the chance to get his singles on vinyl, it's brilliant to finally be able to hear stuff like ""Walk Away Renee"" and ""She's Leaving Home"", which I've been trying to lay my hands on for ages. The version of ""Greetings to the New Brunette"" is a bit of a curiosity, and it doesn't top the version on Taxman in my opinion, but I like the Smiths cover and its good to hear stuff like ""Days Like These"" and ""Raglan Road"". This is a godsend for die-hard Bragg fans, and because of the variety of stuff on it, from early guitar-voice material to work with the Red Stars, it'd be a fairly good introduction too. Keep it up, Bill!"
5,"If you have ever questioned life, you must read this book!","I have the honor of knowing Susanne and her husband John. What Susanne has written is a way of life, it is who she is and what she believes. I have spent hours talking and sharing with her about spirit and life. She truly ""walks her talk"" and is a gift from Wankan Tanka to be shared by all. It is time that we remember that we are all related. Speak of your truth and speak from your heart. If you have not read ""When Spirit Speaks"", I hope that you do. It will speak to you. Mitakuye Oysasin."
2,One of the two batteries in the pack was dead and unchargeable.,"Good and bad. This was a two pack of batteries. One works great, long-lasting, just what I wanted. The other one was dead and wouldn't take a charge, now a paperweight."
3,OK,"I had 2 problems with this calendar:1. You have to laminate all sheets, which is not cheap.2. This is a first calendar I have seen that lists summer months as: July, August, September."
5,It's Bottle Fairy!,"If you like the show, you will like this CD. It contains not just music from the show (which are already cute enough), but also some nice extra. The inserted booklet also has lyrics in Romanji and English translation. Plus, I get the disc from Amazon for the price of a coffee, so no complaint at all.Marble Moon is especially nice for some reason (I always liked the voice of Yui Horie, though, maybe that's why)."
5,The gold standard...,"The Penguin guide has its drawbacks. As an American, I am somwhat put off by what I perceive as a bias towards European performers. Still, all guides are biased in some fashion. The some complaint, for example, could be made about the Gramophone guide. Still, for the breadth of coverage, no one comes close to Penguin."
4,Tight ....especially the Mary Joint,"But the song sang in the truck by Ray & Eva is ""Sweet Thing written and sung by Chaka Khan & Rufus 1975. NOT Mary J"
1,Boring!,"As a Cuban-American I was looking forward to reading this book and suggested it to my Book Club as our next selection. In summary, we found the book to be historically and culturally inaccurate (there are no torillas in Cuba*!). The characters are one-dimensional and unsympathetic and the storyline slow and plodding. It did nothing to inform and educate its readers about the Cuban War of Independence. If I hadn't been reading it for my book club I would have given up after Chapter One.*In Cuba the term ""tortilla"" refers to egg omelettes not the typical tortilla eaten in Mexico and Centeral America. The author clearly makes references to the Mexican type of tortillas in the first chapter of the book. She should have done her homework! This reference caused me to question the rest of the research done for the book."
4,Pretty nice,"Being a Miami Dolphins fan, I wanted to get my baby a couple Fins things. I ordered this towel, and washed it before I was going to use it, but before I used it, I noticed the hooded part was torn. The sewing wasn't in line, so it tore. I sent it back and received a replacement, which I washed as well. It didn't tear, but I looked at the sewing and realized before I use it, I'm going to have to sew it a little better than than the job that was done because I fear future tearing...and I'd really like to use the towel. I haven't gotten to the sewing yet because, well, the baby takes up my time and the other times, I'm either busy or too tired to get to it. Anyways, look before you use it, make sure it's not torn!"
2,Size standard,"I bought 2 shoes a couple months ago i.e 1 is a bostonian w size 8.5 EEE and Floorsheim Morton size 8 EEE. However,the morton size is bigger than that of the bostonian. I think it's important that the standard of shoes size should be consistent. The size 8 should be smaller than 8.5 whatever the brand. Also as a lover of a light shoes I recommend that you add info about the weight of the shoes.The morton is too heavy for me.Thank you"
3,Sizing issue,"I had same problem as the first reviewer - they are definitely a half-size bigger than usual. Unfortunately, Amazon makes you pay for the privilege of finding out (return shipping costs)."
1,My cat would not eat this at all!,My cat is usually not a picky eater but with this food she went on a hunger strike and refused to eat it.
4,Beautiful centerpiece over kitchen table.,This light fixture looks great over the kitchen table. There were a lot of small parts to put it together but the end result was worth it.
1,Speed Stick Fresh,"If you are looking for Speed Stick Fresh Deodorant, do not order this product. The Amazon site shows the image of the Speed Stick Fresh Deodorant, but the actual product shipped is Active Fresh Deodorant, which is a completely different product with a very different scent. The seller did not provide any receipt or return instructions, so due to the smaller dollar amount of the purchase, I just gave up and took this a lesson learned about using Amazon partner sites."
3,"GOOD CD, BUT HARDCORE FANS MAY BE DISAPPOINTED","The CD is pretty good, with good lyrics(angry, yet under control) but fans of the Deftones or Rage Against the Machine may be disappointed. The anger and frustration just isn't all there. One should check it out either way, a good additon to a hardcore collection, but don't expect the explosion found in the Deftones or Rage."
2,Unispired rap metal,"P.O.D......what can ya say. They try to act ""hardcore"" but come off as "" We wanna be cool "". And what gets you cool you might ask? Rap/metal tis the flavor of the month you know. Rock Tha Party may have some good sampling in it but the rest of the album comes off as just ........bad"
4,Good Cd,"I first heard southtown off of this Cd. Which is one awesome song. Then i was surprised that they also had a lot of depth, they can rap solo, and then to hard rock, then to songs like ""Set your eyes to Zion"". These guys are great. They are also Christians. SO the lyrics are full of spiritual things, not rage and fury. They put out a great messages. If you like alt/rock or hard/rock, i reccomend this cd, but you may be surprised at the different kind of music on it. BUY IT!"
4,Good mix of heavy rock and then great rap.,This band seems new and I think has a lot of potential. The hard rock choruses and the fast distorted rapping is exciting and makes me want to get up and do something crazy.
5,There is only one Kris Kristofferson,"A dedicated Kristofferson fan for 26 years, the man amazes me continually. These versions of some of his most famous songs are in many cases better than they have ever been. Over the years his voice has mellowed, but it is still the most soulfull i have ever heard. If you have never been exposed to his music much, try this...listen to this album alone...before you turn it on pretend you mind and your imagination are a blank canvas...sit back, close your eyes, and enjoy the pictures Kris will paint in your mind. Drugs and booze were never this good! No one and I mean no one has ever woven words the way Kris has. No one ever will. He is the man of steel and velvet. Tough, candid, and controversial, but also sensitive with a heart of gold. There is only one Kris Kristofferson. This album is a 5 star!"
5,Only the Love of God can show a multitude of mercies,"A very gut-wrenchingly honest look at a family dealing with schizophrenia, A Multitude of Mercies will make you laugh, cry, gasp...and contemplate your own susceptibility to life. Faith in God permeates this book as this family and particularly the main character tries to reflect His love and mercy toward their ill relative...knowing how each one of them needs the same love and mercy in their own lives. Each character shows his/her own weaknesses as they try to deal with the whirlwind of changes going on with their loved one with schizophrenia. None of us are guaranteed a perfect life. We all need to be shown A Multitude of Mercies."
1,A great work..............of fiction :-(,"This a clearly a book where they author has taken several things that he heard from others, a litle bid of his own experince and then inflated the whole thing.There are too many things in this book that don't fit what happend.I have read other books about A troop 1/9 Cav, and it clear that this author has lent/stolen varius bits and used them with a nice twist in his own bookDon't buy it, its work of fiction....Mr Alexander....shame on you, you disgrace the ones who gave all"
4,a great read.. easy style,"very enjoyable... and well written.. only negative was too few pictures of a personal nature, would have liked to see more photos of Ron, his family and his crews. He and Mr. Sasser have a written a book that gives a great flavor of the war... no p.c. revisionist thoughts in this one.."
5,THIS IS FUN!,A great DVD player with superb quality. There are no annoying lines traveling across you screen either. If you have and S-Video connection (with is on most newer TVs) I suggest you use that. However there are RCA jack connections. I lpve the sound too. If you have a good stereo on your TV or the external speakers it's like having the same experience of a LOEWS Cinema! Words do not express the greatness of it. Get it and see for yourself. Oh and it also plays CDs and maybe CD-R(I haven't tried CD-Rs on it yet).
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK....,This book is a waste of money. It is nothing like the ATAS exam. This book actually scared me since some of the material was so difficult. The test is 1000 times easier than this book leads you to believe. Plus half the stuff in the book has NOTHING to do with the test. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK if you are looking for an accurate study guide for the ATAS exam....
4,Old Testament The Painless Way!,As we have used this guide through the past year I would say that it is fairly simple & straight forward in style. It uses a question format that's easy to use. Read a few passages of bible text & pose the questions from the guide. Even our 4 & 6 year olds like to give a try at answering the questions though it is geared to older children!
5,Excellent,"This is fine recording of this rarely performed opera. Soderstrom specialized in Janacek and her performance is excellent. I think this opera contains some of Janacek's best music. In my experience, few are indifferent about Janacek; either its enthusiasm or disdain. For those who are enthusiastic, this recording is a fine investment."
1,Very disappointed,Too bad I didn't notice the ingredient until after purchase. It has too much sugar and uses sulfur dioxide for color retention.
2,"Lost tracks from ""Trax""?","I agree that the sound quality of this disc is awful. The Smile and Larry Lurex material is available elsewhere in much higher quality. However ... Stephen Rider's Queen bio ""These Are The Days Of Our Lives"" mentions that during the ""Night at the Opera"" sessions, Brian May and Freddie Mercury assisted a soul outfit named Trax and that this material has never been discovered. Is it possible that the six tracks on ""Pre Ordained"" which are not from Smile or Larry Lurex are, in fact, these lost Queen-assisted tracks from ""Trax""? The quality is terrible, but the material is at least interesting, and I believe I do hear a certain Brian-ness in the guitar parts, a certain Freddie-ness in the piano parts, and a certain Queen-ness in the arrangements and background vocals. Maybe we do have some provenance, and there is some historic value to this low-quality CD."
1,Not Queen,"Queen 1 (pink album) and Queen 2 are the best early albums. Purchase those albums instead because they are amazing. Do NOT purchase this album. This album is NOT Queen. There is only one song, ""Mad The Swine"" with Freddie singing, which is also on the first Queen album. I have owned every Queen album since 1975. I beg Brian and Roger to put a stop to this album being available for purchase. For this to be labeled a Queen album is false advertising. I wish I never saw this item."
5,Excellent Book!,"I really enjoyed this book, commitments gave me a lot to think about, but it also made me laugh and it almost made me cry. What I enjoyed most about the book was seeing the strong friendships."
1,buy stock in duracell,"This thing not only runs through $5.00 a week in batteries (a hidden cost they don't bother to mention), but does not project a strong enough signal to your car FM tuner, so the music sounds a lot like an AM radio, static and all. An overpriced, useless piece of junk. You' be better off hunting around for an FM transmitter that plugs into the car cigarette lighter (duh!), like the iRiver model."
3,Nano tuner,I use this device to listent to my books on my Zen Nano. It is an inexpensive device that works fairly well. I did notice however that you need to replace the AA batteries when they are only about 60% used.
1,If you really need one try the TransmitterII Instead,"I was happier when my previous car had a casette player instead of a CD. When will Car mfgs catchup and have a jack in the front of the radio player? On my 20 mile compute, none of the four stations are empty. On the most unoccupied channel, I get a lot of static and drop outs. Requires frequent battery changes once the batteries start drop off the static increases. The chip used by the device actual allows for 14 channels; half of those are near 107MHz but the device is not tuned for up there (I tried by jumpering one of the pins). Haven't tried to get it to use one of other three low channels yet. I'm kind of annoyed that I bought this POS only to find a TranmitterII released two weeks later. I feel robbed. The new version appears to tune to any channel and has an optional external 12V supply. Don't really know if it works any better."
1,"Great idea, bad performance","I bought this item and had to return it because the sound quality was horrible. Don't waste your money. This item gives you only 4 channels to use and all of them sucked. I used my crappy old ""cassette"" adapter to play it through my car speakers, and the sound was far superior. But that won't help those who do not have cassette players in their cars. They have to build a better mousetrap."
1,Don't bother....,"This device is is not worth the bother. In the San Jose CA area, there are radio stations on all four frequencies. If you do find an open frequency, drive 10 minutes and you'll come in range of another station which will drown out the transmitter. Sound quality is AM quality at best. If you have a casette deck, a cassette adapter is far superior.I'd suggest the Belkin go back to the drawing board on this one!!"
1,performance went down,"This worked pretty well for me for the first few weeks, then it just stopped working (how is that possible?) - I could still pick up a slight signal, but it was completely fuzzy and irritating. Really disappointed"
1,ABSOLOUTELY HORRIBLE,"My fiance and I recently purchased the tunecast and found like most of the other consumers have, that the tunecast is horrible. We used it for a variety of gadgets like a portable dvd player and the ever so popular ipod. The tunecast failed to deliver a clear signal regardless of what station it was set to. In fact, if you could get somewhat of a clear sound the second you moved the tunecast the sound went back to static. The tunecast is a waste of money and not worth the trouble."
3,A nice little device,"I recently bought a TuneCast Mobile FM Transmitter to use at work when I'm away from my desk. The transmitter is connected to my computer's audio output & it broadcasts to my GE AM/FM radio (which I also wrote a review about on Amazon) and up to 15 feet, the sound quality is pretty good, but I was hard pressed to get any reception beyond that (at least to 30 feet, which is what it is supposed to reach). That might have something to do with the way it consumes batteries. During the first day of using it, I forgot to turn it off prior to leaving for the day. The next day, the alkaline batteries that were in it were COMPLETELY SPENT! I couldn't believe that a device could use up batteries that fast. In summation, the Belkin FM transmitter is pretty decent device, but if you buy it, beware of the cost in batteries that you'll have to bear. Of course, if you buy re-chargable batteries, then the problem is negated altogether."
1,This thing stinks! Suggest do not buy.,"This transmitter does not work well. Even next to the radio, there is still significant noise in the audio. When I tried to use it with the car, it didn't work at all. Suggest you look for a better product."
3,not bad for the price,"I bought this model for my wife because 1) it was inexpensive (only $18 on sale at a GameStop store) and 2) we didn't have a working cigarette lighter, which many mp3 FM transmitters require. It works reasonably well, but there are times when the transmitter loses the station affinity and we have to change the station. It's not that big of a deal for us, but it might be for some people."
2,"Okay reception, devours batteries like candy!","I've had this thing for about four months now. I bought it to use in my Honda Civic. Now my Civic has the antenna built into the rear window so I figured I would get pretty good quality considering the transmitter would only be a couple of feet, or less, from the window. In reality I got decent reception on only one of the frequencies. It also went through batteries like crazy. If you want decent sound quality you have keep fresh batteries in it. I'm currently looking into the iTrip."
2,Buy something else.,"Pros: It's cheap. I got 3 of them for about $10 dollars somewhere.Cons: A waste of my $10 dollars. Sound quality is fuzzy at best, even when it's sitting less than 5 feet away from the radio. Lot's of static if you even nudge the transmitter. Frequently *goes dead silent*; I have 3 units and they're all identical in this respect.I hate to say ""you get what you pay for"" because you don't even get that much with this thing.It is, however, a great gift to give to someone you don't like or want to irritate for a few hours. It's dead simple to set up and use, so when it doesn't work they'll start pulling out hair trying to figure out why until they realize that the unit just doesn't work as you'd think."
2,A little dissappointing,"I bought this so that I could listen to my MPIO MP3 player in my car through my car stereo. I live in a fairly urban area and I had a lot of trouble finding good reception on one of the four frequencies I could use. The best one worked OK until I tried to put the Tunecast down, then it went all wonky. I had to keep holding it to hear the music at all. As you can probably imagine, this is not really the best situation while driving. Even while I was holding on to it, the sound quality wasn't very good. I'll keep it for use in a pinch, but it's not the great, must-have gadget I thought it would be."
2,I intensely dislike this thing.,"If I had truly hated it, I'd have given it 1 star. Anyway, you plug this into the headset jack of the iPod and then, after inserting 2 AAA batteries, set a slide switch on it to one of 4 available frequencies (all on the low end of the FM band), set your FM radio to the matching frequency, and push the big button on the TuneCast to get it to transmit. By the way, of you forget to press the big button again before you exit the car, count on the 2 AAAs being dead when you return.There is more static, popping and crackling than there is music. I'm sure you get the picture. No matter how I positioned it, it wasn't very clear. I even tried to use it in a car with its radio antenna mounted on the front fender, but it wasn't much better (the TuneCast transmits to your radio's antenna, not to your radio's faceplate).I got the Griffin iTunes, and this was somewhat better to be sure, but still not good enough to make me give up the headphones or the cassette tape converter."
4,Alright if ya know what to do...,"For the first 10 minutes, i hated the thing. But i wasn't going to take it back because i really needed something to play my CD player in my truck with. (My Chevy Colorado doesnt have a tape or cd player). After messing with it i temporarily gave up. The next day i found out, after doing some extensive research by means of disassembling, that the antenna is the 3 inch cord!! I immediately ran in the house and grabbed a 6ft male on both ends stereo cord from my computer speaker set, a female-female joiner and ran back out to my truck. i plugged my belkin in the joiner along with the 6ft cord and plugged the other end in my cdplayer. I then coiled up the remaining wire and put it in my glove box along with the belkin (which was turned on). I pushed play on my cdplayer and it works PERFECTLY! NO static/interference. I thought this product sucked majorly-which it does unless you do what i did. Try it, whatcha got ta loose? ONLY THE STATIC!"
2,"Cheap, but im still returning mine for a refund.","Well, the reviews are true. It's a nifty little piece of equipment, but the sound quality is so poor, I'd rather not even use it. From what I hear, it works better in rural areas where there is not much other frequencies that can interefere. I live in a major metropolitan area, so this device does me no good. I'm returning it."
3,OK for home stereo,"as other reviews mention, this is very bad for use in the car. when i use it in my home stereo though, it works well, that is only if i point the transmitter directly at my stereo from close range. if i do that it usually has very good reseption. only buy this if you plan to use it at home.if you want to use your ipod in the car, i would recomend the ""sony minidisc/discman cassette adapter"". it works great with no interference, not even any skips."
5,Best Ever,"I ordered this because one was not enough. I also have a friend who has the machine and her canaster was damaged when she got it as a gift, so I ordered a second one for her. This way I can have two diffrentkind of ice cream. I just love this machine."
2,Did not work for my baby's cradle cap,This product did not work for my baby's cradle cap. Her hair fell off more when she started using this. Organic coconut oil works better and cheaper I think in moisturizing the scalp and removing the flakes with fine tooth baby comb.
3,"Works pretty well, but it's expensive","My baby didn't really have cradle cap - he didn't have big scaly patches, just some flakes more like dandruff. After a couple of applications, there were less flakes but they weren't entirely alleviated. Since this is a pretty small bottle, if I have to keep applying it constantly it's going to be pretty expensive. Plus, it's really difficult to rinse out of my baby's hair - I had to shampoo at least twice, and even then there was a little residue that lasted until his next bath. And it seemed to dry his hair out a little - I bought conditioner to counteract that. But it did improve the condition of his scalp, so while not some crazy miracle cure, it does do what it promises to do. Oh, and the applicator tip makes it easy to apply."
1,alternative,"i bought this product desperately for some remedy for my baby's cradle cap, but i couldn't wait so I ended up using the old trick of dousing her head with mineral oil and combing out the scales with a small tooth comb that came in her grooming kit and rinsing it off in her bath. I used the mustela foam shampoo, but SPARINGLY. I realized i shouldn't wash her scalp too often with shampoo because that just dried up her scalp."
2,Didn't Work For Us,"Bought this product when my son was only 8wks...he's now five months. Have seen no real improvement in his cradle cap, and have given it ample time to work. I like how the product is more creamy than greasy and has no real fragrance. Just disappointed with the results. :{"
3,"fatal errors, crashes and player killers","This game could be great some day, but for now it needs a major rewrite and to go back to beta for about 3 months.The chances of your char going into the null zone after 2 months is about even, and the chances of losing your account data after 5 months is almost 100 %.....Save your money and buy something else....listen to the warnings of various older players and refuse to play this laggy, full of errors, POS.."
3,for real movie?,"Based on a true life experience, I am sure lot of film is ""Hollywood"" added attractions, after all they where not there. Film deals with young white boy who is brought up by Native Americans in Idaho, and wyoming in the late 18 hundreds. For history buffs a lesson to be learned about our history and the good side of our Native Americans who mostly get a bum rap from Hollywood and the likes of John Wayne. This movie is worth the time spent."
4,A NICE WESTERN,"I PURCHASED THIS FLIM ON THE REVIEW OF OTHERS .WIND RIVER IS AN EVENLY PACED STORY,ALSO IT WAS SHOT VERY WELL,GREAT SCENERY,THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS I LIKE MOVIES SUCH AS WIND RIVER"
5,textbook of hyperbaric medicine,"best, up to date book I have read on HBO.for those who practice its an excellent guide and for thelayman it will open your eyes to what hbo can do( andcannot do) as well letting you know who cannot usethe hyperbaric chamber."
4,Comprehensive Paper Crafts Book,"I disagree with the reviewer who described the projects as mainly suitable for children. This is a well written, well designed book which can serve as an able introduction to various paper crafts. Yes, some of the material is available on the web, but you would need to test the instructions you found. My experience has been that Lark Books are good and that is true of this book."
1,GROSSLY OVERPRICED; projects only fit for young children,"This book is grossly overpriced. Other than the origami (which is lovely, but you could buy a number of excellent origami books for the cost of this atrocity), the projects seem intended for young children -- and inept ones at that. There are many excellent craft books, magazines, and videos available, and cable television produces some outstanding shows (e.g., the Carol Duvall reruns, and I've heard great things about DIY, although we don't get that in my area). Don't waste your money on this overpriced garbage!"
5,Such and underrated album....,"Such an underrated album, when people talk about poison they never mention this album. This album is great from start to finish. I have over 600+ cd's and this is my favorite. Even the songs that weren't released as singles are good enough for radio airplay.... ""valley of lost souls"", ""let it play"", ""hell or high water"", ""poor boy blues"" etc. SUPERB production. For anyone that just owns poison's greatest hits or the best of poison, and is looking to check out another poison album, definitely give this one a shot! Poison at their best"
3,Very disapointed,"I expected much more from Nick Malgieri, been a teacher and all, at least foolproof recipes!!! I personaly made some and others , been a pastry chef, didn't even try because they were oversimplyfied and they would not achieve the best result. Too bad."
3,Rainbow Mystery,This game is a little different from the usual drop or match games and at times it is easy and at times harder. Good for most everyone in the family. I liked it.
2,Bad Design (Unless You Like the Look of Plastic),"To put a roll of toilet paper on this holder, you lift the lefthand knob/end of the bar and pivot the bar upwards. The problem is that there is gap between the inner edges of the bar knobs and the ends of the cone-shaped parts of the posts; this gap reveals the unsightly gray plastic that covers the ends of the posts, with a slightly wider gap on the left that makes it look as though you can't place the end far enough back toward the wall. It's ugly and totally ruins the aesthetics. We were able to remove the plastic on the left post, but on the right, the plastic cannot be completely removed, so we had to trim the plastic so it wouldn't show. There is still a gap, but at least now it's metal that shows instead of plastic. I'm sure this holder would function with the plastic bits left in place, but it needs a little surgery to make it decent-looking as well as functional."
5,A must read for parents with prodigals,"If you have a prodigal child, you know how devastating it can be to the family. This book puts that all into perspective and explains the dynamics going on. Using real life stories, the author helps parents with prodigals understand their situation, deal with the emotions and second guessing, and know that they are not alone. A must read."
5,Parents with Broken Hearts Book,This is an excellent book for parents who are having trouble withrebellious teens. It is a quick read and offers wise advise from an author who has obviously been in that parent's shoes. I've bought about 18 copies to give to struggling parents.
1,A BIG Waste!!!!!!!!!!,"you would think that this is great for girls who would like to keep things a secret. i looked at the other reviews and wanted to try it for myself.PLEASE!!!!It didn't really keep me occupied. Get a good one that isn't ""high priced."""
5,What a Christmas blessing,"I love the song THE CHRISTMAS SHOES by NewSong and was excited about the book & movie last year. Both were great and I still get choked up whenever I hear the song. I was glad to see that Nathan's story continues. Get a box of tissues and lock yourself away to read this great story. You will cry, you will laugh and you will realize how truly blessed you are if you are healthy--and how many small blessings we take for granted each day. This book will remind you to be thankful to our Creator for each day we have and all His blessings to us.Was this review helpful to you Yes No"
3,descent value,"if you need to hook up old style light controllers,this is the cheapest,most reliable way to control up to 8 lights/outlets.I chain 4 lights off of one outlet with use of outlet multipliers,this is not recommended for high wattage lights,but for stringing several small lights onto one outlet it works fine,The quality of the metal casing is a little suspect as I already bent one of these units with a small zip tie that didn't break when I twisted it,not as durable as older models...but still a good value for mobile DJ's or small venues looking to add some controllable lighting to the mix."
3,"Not bad, but better overall astronaut accounts elsewhere...","This is a pretty light (and light-hearted) account of one of the most experienced astronauts in NASA history. Really, just a re-hashing of the program and the space race with only a few new details (Gemini space-walking problems...Apollo 17 details). This only serves as a decent compliment to Chaiken's ""Man on the Moon"" and pales in astronaut biography to Lovell's ""Lost Moon"". Not a totally bad read, but not great history either..."
3,Geno,"What a great read. Parts of this book was a bit hokey, but I really enjoyed the book. Based on what I've read in other material about NASA, Gene was one of the most liked astronauts. What a great guy. A must read. I've read a lot of material and books on the Mecury thru Apollo missions, and I think the best I've read was Micheal Collins ""Carrying the Fire"" this lends itself to great detail and leaves you with a good education.KLD"
3,Great concept. Great compilation of songwriters.,"Great cover photo of the two aging musicians. Ronstadt's voice is still very powerful and impactful, while the same cannot be said for Harris. The opening track is a real winner - Loving the Highway Man. Also, Jackson Browne's Song for a Dancer and Springsteen's Across the Border are covered well. In all, I found the CD enjoyable. My only confusion with the CD would be the song selection. Cohen's Sisters of Mercy and Sinead O'Connor's To Mother You don't seem to fit in my opinion. Is it a collection of songs with a western feel? If so, O'Connor's tune really does not fit, and it would be tough to mirror the beauty of her (O'Connor's) original recording of this song."
4,"Context, not music , is what is so interesting about Tucson","It surprises me no one has picked up on this - but the the title song written by Rosanne Cash and sung by these two has a Jewish theme to it - the Western Wall is in Jerusalem and is the holiest site in Judaism. Also, look closely at the CD itself and you will make out in the left hand corner a 'Star of David' (six-pointed star symbolic of Israel and the Jewish people. The music is quite good, but I was clearly taken by this particularly since none of these artists are Jewish. Any thoughts on this from anyone- are they into the Kabbalah craze, i.e. Madonna?"
4,BitterSweet,"The lyrics are edgy but not quite blasphemous; the voices and instruments are great. One wonders to what extent the artists identify with the lyrics, and to what extent they would be receptive to having (or already have) a direct eternal relationship with God. Linda has the better trained voice but Emmylou comes through clear as a bell with great tone quality (but has some slight difficulty here and there), seemingly with absolutely no ""enhancements"", and her guitar work is supurb - and they work impressively well together. The other instruments are also a definite plus."
1,Bah!,"Judging by this almost unlistenable album, these two singers, my favourites from the seventies, have lost it all, except the 1917 redndition of Olney's song I didnt find any good song here. In top of it all it is overproduced. A waste of money, listen to their early cd's and forget it."
4,A surprisingly rockin' album,"For those who miss the good old days of 70s rock, this is the album for you. Though it features almost all cover songs, it is like a blast of fresh air in a popular music scene dominated by teeny-boppers and tatooed miscreants. Neither Linda or Emmylou have ever been in finer voice and the production work by rock veteran Glyn Johns (The Who) is outstanding. Of particular note are covers of Bruce Springsteen ""Across the Border"" and his wife Patti Scialfa ""Valerie"" as well as a Jackson Browne tune ""For a Dancer"" that is better than the original version. Overall, though slightly uneven, a very fine album.If you like this album, check out Emmylou's ""Wrecking Ball"" album, which is recorded in a similar style."
3,Disappointing,I am a big fan of both Emmylou and Linda Ronstadt. I found the album disappointingly uneven and the song selection a bit boring. They are both capable of much better. I gave it 3 stars because that's the worse either of these truly talented women could ever earn.
1,A Lazy recording job.,"This is a CD of essentially good songs. The mixing job, however, is woefully lacking. The voices are either very poorly recorded or just plain relegated to the back seat in the total sound job. The accompaniment constantly overshadows the singing. The songs were also sung without much feeling at all."
1,Extremely disappointed in Western Wall.,"After very much liking the latest ""Trio"" album, I was excited to purchase ""Western Wall"". On hearing it, I was disappointed to say the least. The song selection is boring. The arrangements are boring. The harmonies are boring. It's a very flat recording without a single cut that stands out. I wish I could get my money back."
5,Good product!,Easily installed with hand tools in the garage. Fits perfectly. No complaints. Tows flatbed car trailer and horse trailer with no problems.
5,Creating Memories,I had a wonderful time reading through this book and remembering the things my parents did for me. Now I almost always give this book to new parents. In this busy day and age it's easy to forget that the most simple tradition can mean a great deal.
4,Good for teething puppes,At first my puppy didn't pay attention to this bone but as he got a little older it became his favorite. He has chewed it up pretty good but it is still intact. It's the next best thing to giving him a real raw meaty bone.
4,"enchanting, slightly off-beat little charmer of a film","Set in a coal mining village in 1950's Nova Scotia, this little gem of a film holds one to his seat throughout the movie. Helena Bonham Carter brillantly portrays a common girl who is at once confused and sure of herself. If you liked her previous performances, you'll love this film. END"
5,A Truth Told In A Beautiful Story,"This is an amazingly real story, so well acted and directed. The characters are all so natural. I love this film because it tells a TRUTH about the actual cost of mining. The location is beautifully photographed here in Canada on the East Coast. This is a must see for anyone who enjoys a thoughtful and genuine story about life."
4,Long time looking for such Box,"Very nice looking box that store 20 watches in one place,I ahve been looking for such box for long time"
1,Very bad customer service,I've ordered a Photoflex Medium Fabric Grid for the Medium softboxes. I`ve received a Small Fabric grid for the small softboxes (a mistaken link between Amazon and Adorama). I`ve payed over $70 in Shipping & Handling. Now adorama says there is a mistake between Adorama and Amazon and Adorama does not send the correct item. They can send me the correct one in other order (paying again Shipping & Handling).How can I resolve your mistake without paying again Shipping & Handling?
4,Houses of Key West,Excellent pictures of great Key West houses including addresses. No interior pictures. Book fell apart at binding after very little viewing.
4,Might not what you expected...,"This album is pretty good. But the thing that is not-so-good is, she mixed some of her songs with rock and pop... She should've sticked with just pure pop. But overall, this is not bad for a debut album. Another thing is when I first heard ""Smile"" I thought she was going to be singing pop stuff, but instead some pop and modern rock mixed. I like ""Smile"", ""Unhappy Anniversaey"" and ""Graduation""."
3,The girl from Hairspray.,"Vitamin C was a decent debut album for this unusual pop artist. Vitamin C's real name is Colleen Fitzpatrick, she used to be an actress and had her own band, Eve's Plum. This album came out when female pop singers ruled the summer in 1999. She's definitely not a Britney but I feel Vitamin C had somewhat of identity crisis and that's why this album never really broke any new ground. There are lot of tracks on the cd that just don't work, the pop hooks and her vocal delivery lack energy. The song she is mostly remembered for is Graduation, the best song on the album by the way. Smile and Me Myself and I were moderate hits but too bad Happy Anniversary was never released, such a under-rated gem. Ok album but after 10 years later, the novelty has worn off."
3,Kind of Weird but Some Good Songs,"Vitamin C used to be the lead singer of another band that was alternative, and the lyrics of some of these songs kind of reflect that. Some of the songs are complete bubble gum pop, but some are darker and more alternative sounding. This made the album sound kind of weird. I liked a few songs though."
3,"Not bad, but could be better","I was a fan of Eve's Plum (particularly Cherry Alive), so I had high hopes for this once I got past 'Graduation' (a truly HORRIBLE song). I like most of the songs, but can do without the pointless samples and other gimmicks (the fake Jamaican accent on 'Smile', otherwise a good song). My favorite song is probably the second one, 'Turn Me On'."
5,VITAMIN C ROCKS!,"THIS CD IS TOO MUCH.... HERE'S MY REVIEW.SMILE IS LIKE TOTALLY THE BOMB! I MEAN THE LYRICS, THE BEAT, EVERYTHING IS JUST AWESOME.ME, MYSELF AND I IS ALSO PRETTY GOOD. I LOVED IT.GRADUATION IS THE BEST SONG I'VE HEARD IN THIS CD ASWELL AS THE CD OF ANY OTHER ARTIST, PERIOD. IT HAS A TRUE MEANING OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER GRADUATION. WILL THINGS BE THE SAME OR WILL THEY CHANGE? LISTENING TO THIS SONG REALLY GETS YOU THINKING OF WHAT IS TO COME IN THE NEAR FUTURE. IT'S JUST SO HARD TO STOP LISTENING TO THIS SONG. BY THE WAY CONGRATULATIONS CLASS OF 2000!"
5,A Must See! Kudos to BBC for bringing Longtime OOP Episodes to DVD,"This is 3 titles about 100 minutes each. All three are great and a must own for any Whoian. State of Decay(5 stars) is one of my all-time Tom Baker episodes. Warriors Gate(4.5 stars) is very very good and Full Circle(4 stars) is entertaining. All three together make an excellent trilogy.The Doctor and Romana get pulled into in E-Space along with K-9. they have difficulty getting out! Things just are not the same in E-Space!This VHS set was selling for over $100 a few years ago and was almost impossible to find new, because it has been out of print for a long time. BBC made a wise choice in bringing this one time rarity to DVD. Again a must see!"
3,"Good price, good purchase","The battery works. The price was good. I only recently made the purchase, so my knowledge of its lifespan or durability is limited. But so far, I'm happy."
2,nearly dead within 9 months,"Purchased one of these about 9 months ago for our Canon Powershot G3, and we're already having big problems with it. Also, a few months after we started using this battery, the camera's sensor died and had to be replaced at a cost of about $150 + shipping. Was the sensor problem related to the use of this battery? I don't know that it was, but I can't rule out the possibility."
4,pink i said?,my mom asked for a pink collar. this was perfect for her little dog. she reports to me that the fit was great. moving the colar tags was a little dificult.
4,Good colar for a husky little dog,"I looksed everywhere for a collar large enough, but narrow enough for my husky (fat) little dog. This one worked perfectly... its like a collar for a plus sized puppy! The collar is made well, and fits good. I do wosh the design was a little clearer but it functions great."
5,Love It!!!,"We love this Lupine Earth Day collar! Lupine products are always well worth their cost! I've been using Lupine dog products since 2009 (when I got my puppy), I have yet to have to replace anything -due to fraying, chewing, etc.!"
1,Very flimsy,I thought it would be more substantial than it is. It is not usable for us - maybe for a toy dog.
5,"Great Music, Great Mastering","If you like drumming and/or Mickey Hart, this is a great record to own.As far as the sound quality goes, the people at Shout did a magnificent job. In this day and age, hot loud mastering is the norm (google/wikipedia ""loudness war"" for more info), this disc is an exception. They took every care to make sure this disc sounds as good as possibly could given the source material (1976 analogue reels), and it shows. My highest compliments to Shout for doing things the right way and giving me a disc that I love playing.Music 5 starsMastering 5+ starsBravo!EDIT: turns out that Shout! didn't master the discs, rather it was rykodisc and shout! just used the tapes. So the kudos go to rykodisc for the original mastering, and to shout! for not messing with a good thing."
4,One of my childhood favorites,"I loved this book as a child, back when it first came out. I still remember many details from it. I loved the imagination-sparking fantastical elements and I really enjoyed how an ordinary but clever boy could still be a great success. That I still remember it fondly among all my other books speaks volumes."
5,good product,Was ship wrong item. Wrote a e-mail within hours it was corrected and recive the correct items within couple of days.
2,Incorrect biographical information,"This biography has some errors in it, most notably the date of death for Jack Yeaman Bryan. I would like to know where the information was obtained to create the biography. J.Y. Bryan was my father and his date of death was May 22, 1988. His mother's name (my grandmother) is spelled wrong and my name is also incorrect. I am unsure of some of the dates for his Foreign Service activities, but I believe he worked in Cairo in 1952.Kirsten Stuart Bryan (now Kirsten Bryan Carpentier)"
5,"Wow, Dana! Way to go.","I have loved the Kate Shugak mysteries, but this new series is spectacular. Liam Campbell is a character you want to know ALL about; and Wy is todays woman. I eagerly look forward to their unfolding adventures. Just don't forget about Kate. Your following for her is well esablished. -A faithful reader in Warrensburgh, NY."
1,Contrived,"The only thing right about this one was the Kindle version price. It cost nothing. I recently read the first of the Kate Shugak books and although not special it was readable, and Alaska needs a bit of literary exposure even if it isn't exactly literature. Liam Campbell is an unbelievable clone and the situations seemed so unreal the editor should have told Miss Stabenow to forget this hero."
1,fire and ice,it tops one of the worse books i've ever read. since i disliked it at once--i wonder why i bought it?
4,Fire and Ice,"Was a little long to take off, but Dana Stabenow knows her subject, the story is highly believable and entertaining. Maybe it's because I live in the Caribbean that I love to read books on cold countries, the village mentalities there, the long winter, the resourcefulness and the sense of community of these little villages."
1,Give me a break,"When I buy a mystery book, that's what I want. I don't mind a hint of romance but the best mystery writers only give you a hint. You can't get very far in this book before you realize that everyone is more concerned about their libido than anything else, and the author is very graphic. Either write a mystery novel or a romance novel; those of us who truly enjoy mystery novels would greatly appreciate it."
3,Good read.,"Not as good as her Kate Shugak books, but an interesting look into life in Alaska, none the less, I liked Kate Shugak early on, but kind of lost interest when she used her books for a soap box. Not that there is anything at all wrong with supporting the native American cause, but she was popular enough at that time to have done a great job in other ways. i.e. speaking engagements, endorsements, etc. But she has matured into a really good author and you can depend on her for a good read."
4,Fire & Ice Review,"The characters are especially well drawn and described. The inner conflicts are apparent and engaging to the reader. The ending was a surprise, as all good mystery novels should be. I intend to read others in the series."
5,Adirondack Mountains,"I thorougly enjoyed the book because it is a good handbook for hiking the beautiful Adirondack Mountain area, tells with humor some adventures of the author and his family, and tells about the Beahan family dating from the early part of the 20th century. If you like to hike and camp, if you live in upstate New York or if your name is Beahan, you will especially enjoy the book."
2,Bowie at his strangest...and that's not a good thing.,"I have to admit this creeped me out when I was a kid. The bizarre subject matter and Bowie at his most affected were just too strange for me in my adolescence and time has not improved my opinion. I will admit to a certain fascination with the psychotic narrator of ""Running Gun Blues"" the quirky little interruption of ""Black Country Rock"" and the title cut and ""The Width of a Circle"" still have an exotic majesty, but the overall effect is an odd mixture of apocalyptic science fiction and pointlessness. Musically there are a lot of interesting choices but by the time Bowie gets done with his various methods of doing in humanity, I found myself bored by the repetitiveness of these themes. While I'm sure this Bowie incarnation has its defenders, I'm really glad he outgrew this stage rather quickly."
1,SO MANY TYPOS!!!,"There are so many typo's and misprints in this book some topics are hard to get through. Some of the review questions don't have answers in the back, some are in the wrong order, and Chapter 7 Answers were skipped all together.I would NOT recommend this book to anyone!"
2,Easy to understand but beware,"This text is an easy to understand review of Six Sigma; however, I would not use it as a reference. I've found several instances where formulas are incorrect. For example, calculating Cp is done using the formula (USL-LSL)/6s. The book makes a minor omission, leaving out the parentheses. There are misspellings. There is one incidence where the typesetter transposed a ""."" with a ""/"", making a fraction out of a decimal.These errors would not affect a certified, experienced practitioner aside from perhaps making him or her snort coffee onto a keyboard; however, if the person reading the book is not experienced or mathematically savvy (read most managers), the errors could affect outcome of a project adversely. I bought the book as a potential text for teaching managers about six-sigma concepts and basics. It may still work for that purpose; however, a book on a quality improvement method should not have this many, this magnitude of errors.I would not recommend this book."
1,One Sigma Book,"I read all the bad reviews but since the book was published by McGraw-Hill, which bills itself as America's Leading Educational Publisher, I decided to try it anyway. I should have listened to the reviews. It is a book about quality that seems to have had no proof-reading. And the last chapter is no more than a blatant advertisement for the authors' Six Sigma consulting firm."
5,LOVE this CD!!!,I just bought this CD and I love it! The music is fun and catchy and it even has music from the Scooby-Doo Zombie Island movie! This CD brings back so many wonderful childhood memories and I love to listen and dance to it with my nephew!
5,Excellent Album! You can't beat Amr Diab.,"Hands down; every single Amr Diab album turns out to be awesome! No need to worry here.All the tracks on this album are enjoyable and typical Amr Diab; catchy rythms and lyrics. On this album, there is a good combination of party songs, mellow songs and romantic songs. There is an especially romantic and melodic song on there called ""Wamaloh."" Very nice!!Every album that comes out by Amr Diab makes you say ""No, this has got to be the best of all his albums."" And that's what you'll say about this one!"
5,"Great toy, helps promote walking & more",This toy was a Xmas present for my grandson & it really helped him to learn to walk & so much more. He's almost 2yo & still uses the toy. And he has been really tough on this toy & it is very durable. I am very happy with this purchase & most definitely recommend to others!
1,Did Not Hold A Charge,I was very disappointed in this battery. It will not hold a charge for any length of time. I have bought off brand batteries before and decided to give this one a try since the Sony battery is so expensive. In this case it would have been better to spend the extra money for the Sony.
3,WE WANT BOND!!!,"The movie was great, but i must add...not quite as attractive as the first movie. The first soundtrack was amazing!!! BUT, i cannot believe they left the violinists song off of here!!! Werent they playing Beethoven? GOD Id love to get my hands on that piece!!!"
1,cuisinart food processor sheath,I put it on the machine and it would not work. The Mfg said if I use it I do not get my money back. I had to throw it away because it did not work at all. Very disappointed.
2,Colors were not as shown.,This is a very poor quality area rug. I wanted to send it back but they told me to keep it or give it away.I donated to the church.
1,These contain sunflower oil.,I am returning these cranberries because the ingredients list did not indicate that this product contains sunflower oil. Hopefully Amazon will change the ingredients list to indicate this. I hope this helps someone else before buying.Amazon was good and is going to process a refund for me even though the system said this item can't be returned.
4,"Small, but great for its price.","My Sephiroth shipped fast. The plastic was detatched from the cardboard due to old glue but i had some super glue in my desk to fix that in less than a minute. It's about 2/3 the size of an average action figure, but for 20 bucks its a great buy and it makes your friends pretty jealous."
5,Absolutely fantastic!,"I have a 2003 Dodge Durango with a 5.9 engine that had a squealing belt or tensioner. I priced out other belts locally from the chain auto parts stores, and the price on the Gatorback from Amazon was less than what the local stores wanted for Dayco or other brands they carry. My brother is a mechanic, highly recommended the Gatorback. I would have had him get me one at his cost, but he lives 250 miles from me and I neeeded it sooner than Christmas.Also, if you do not already have one, get the Amazon Prime membership. I was hesitant at first, but it has more than paid for itself with free 2 day shipping!"
2,What is a home theater system?,This so called home theater system does not have a DVD player or even a VCR. How can they call it such?
4,"Very stirring, very Military",This music is moving and inspiring. It elicits such strong emotions in me that I prefer to listen to it when I am alone because I can't hear it without tearing a little. But I mean that in the best possible way.
1,Get what you pay for,"Its just what it is a story about a young girl wanting to get out and discover herself. Wasn't really going to be all that telling about the AT. There aren't any out there that will satisfy everyone. Sit back, enjoy the scenery, forget the story line and dream about past days and future days on the AT."
2,Move of a love story than about the hike,"While Southbounders had moments that captured the joys and trials of long hikes, it was more of a love story than anything else. ON the download we got the audio was out of sync with frequent skips."
2,"Price is right, but","The ink comes out a bit too dark. The mid-tones are not as pronounced as the more expensive brands. The toner cartridge business should be regulated. Like diamonds, 1000% mark up. Scammers."
3,THE HOLMES/DRACULA FILE - A Review By Steve Vernon,"This is a solid little read for vampire fans and Holmes fans alike. A fast moving, atmospheric romp through the streets of Victorian London with a pair of characters who ought to have been paired together a long time ago. Well worth the read. I'm looking forward to hunting up the rest of the series. (or should I say ""digging"" up.)_Yours in horror,Steve Vernon"
3,Not quite what I expected,"I thought this would include at least some of the Bowery Boys movies, based on the title. But it turns out none of those movies are available legally. No matter, the East Side Kids are still pretty funny, and you can see how they evolved into the famed Bowery Boys. My other complaint is that the overall picture and sound quality are not the best!"
2,Enjoyable but Poor Quanity DVD's,"I enjoyed watching these movies again but I have to tell you that the quality of them is very poor. It's like watching old 8mm films that have been warn down. On top of this, stamped in the lower right corner of every movie, for the full length of the movie, is the title of the DVD, Boys of the City The East side Kids. Fortunately after watching the movies for a while I kind of blocked it out but it still annoys me as to why they did this. If you really enjoy the East side Kids then I would say buy this set, it's cheep enough but don't expect restored video."
3,Pretty Good Soundtrack to Accompany a Good Movie,"This is a pretty decent soundtrack to accompany a pretty good movie. It makes good use of repeated motifs to accentuate certain aspects and events, very similar to a John Williams type approach at times. However I must admit that I prefer dramatic soundtracks and though this does a good job of counterpointing and accentuating the film it just isn't that good at letting you get swept away in the sound. Maybe that makes sense especially given the silent nature of this film and what it is trying to accentuate but I just don't like it all that much. As music in and of itself I find it better I must admit, but still there is very little that is extremely memorable."
5,Listen to reviewer from Calgary,"The reviewer from Calgary is correct. To all you Corelli fans, stop lying about the number of high notes and the types of high notes that Corelli hits in the live recording of ""Gli Ugonotti"" from La Scala. We know Corelli died several weeks ago, but stop inflating his already overrated reputation.This set is as complete as we can expect for this opera. It is a very nice studio recording.I also recommend Nicolai Gedda's live recording of ""Les Huguenots in French from Vienna. Gedda is excellent. He hits many high notes and attempts the florid music. Rita Shane makes a very good Queen Marguerite."
2,Are there no editors?,"While this short book is a pleasant enough companion for a long soak in the tub, it would have been greatly improved by some decent editing. Grammatical errors, repetition of anecdotes, and constant references to the authors' wealth abound. Since Michael Korda is editor-in-chief at Simon & Schuster, such lapses are appalling."
5,awesome! but you need some strength to install.,"I've installed numerous in ceiling speakers and these are the best sounding quality for the price by far; however, the front screws that turn the plastic clamps that secure the speaker to the drywall were almost stripped from my installing because as I found out later, after much sweat and grunting, the screws actually screw through a plastic lining to better secure the placement of the plastic clamps on the screws. I would recommend screwing through the initial plastic cap first before installing and then backing the screw out which turns the clamps because it is the initial screwing that is the most difficult but well worth the extra step before installing since holding a speaker in place and screwing with a max effort, at the same time requires some agility while upon an 8ft. ladder. The sound is worth the hassle and price."
5,"Sounds Great, Easy install","I was nervous when I purchased these for $40 from Amazon, thinking they would be poor quality, but I was pleasantly surprised. They have good sound, and installed very easy. The instructions were good, and they had a handy cardboard cut-out jig for marking the walls. They produce very little bass, but that is completely understandable, considering its a 6"" speaker in a ""sealed enclosure"". They were easy to paint too."
4,good for Mediatation,Nice clear thoughts in this concise book. Well worth the cost. Very good very daily use or 5 minute meditatons. Great service from Amazon.
3,Power OK,The power supply was acceptable. As an aircraft electrician I was unimpressed with the bundling of output wire exiting from the chassis.
3,"Good book, but only considers singles","I ordered this book with the hope that it would offer some guidance to a 20-something like me who has it all, but still feels unfulfilled and over-stretched. This book is ideal for singles in their 20s, but it doesn't even consider those of us (like me) who are married in our 20s. So not a lot of it applied to people in my situation with a husband and kids. Otherwise, it would be a good book for singles."
3,No Clue,"I really don't have a review. This book sounded like the best of the bunch for 20 somethings. I gave this book to my niece for her 21st birthday. I left a personal message with the book. She loves reading and her Aunt (me) love self help and inspirational growth reading. As she embarks on her journey I hope she will use this for guidance, direction and/or support. As of now she still has 9 more years in her 20's.I'm hopful she will get something out of it, Even in the future."
1,Should be a discount bin game,"I had a bad feeling about this game when I picked up the box but I ignored my gut feeling. Just goes to show you that you shouldn't doubt yourself. This game has good graphics, but the level design and overall flow of the game is very amateurish at best. When you get to the end of a level the screen freezes, turns purple then you get a loading screen. Needless to say its a very abrupt transition.Wait for this game to get to the bargan bin before shelling out the money for it."
4,"Quick, fun read","Charlaine Harris has done a great job mixing it up with her first of the Southern Vampire Mysteries. From mystery, to supernatural and even (gasp) romance, this book is a quick read. It never takes itself too seriously and who doesn't love a heroine who can kick some butt? For those of you into the TrueBlood TV series, you'll find this fairly different from the series' story line. But don't despair, the books give you added insight and are just as entertaining. Bottom line: if you're wanting to pass a few hours of indulgent fun, pick up Dead Until Dark and enjoy!"
4,Campy fun,Interesting little book. Sort of a campy Anita Blake. Bill is likable and Sooky is ditzy. Nice mix of comedy and violence.
3,Debating...,"I'm seriously trying to decide whether or not to read the second book. I'm not one to give up on a series once I've started it, but Sookie just annoyed me beyond belief. I can't pinpoint exactly what it was about her as a character that got to me, but wow.The plot itself was both interesting and unique - which is a rare combination in this genre. That's what kept me reading. Now that I'm finished, however, I'm really wondering if it's worth it to KEEP reading.Sookie kind of grows on you by the end of the book, but - after reading a few novels with witty, intelligent, butt-kicking females, Sookie kind of comes as a shock...I really wouldn't recommmend this book to anyone looking for a thick plot and great romance - you probably won't find that here. Here's hoping the next book is better?"
3,First-person voice was strong and unique.,"It was fun and short. The first-person voice was strong and unique. Sookie is a likeable and believable character. The chapters weren't too short or too long; they were just right for my taste. All the -ly adverbs in the dialogue killed it for me. By the time I neared the end of the book it became highly annoying to read. Unfortunately, I won't be reading the rest of the books in the series."
4,great...,"This book was a great short story.. I had seen the HBO show first and then decided to pick this up when I saw it in a bookstore. However, i have to say, its not a spectacular read. In a nutshell its a well-written, simple romance novel with no depth. I never really cared that much about the characters.I'm sad to say, I think the HBO show goes into greater depth with each of its characters."
4,Dead until Dark,"Dead until dark is a wonderful read..love scenes could be a little hotter, but a great book as is. I had to buy all the books because I have been bitten. Oh and Bill Compton is too cute."
3,Too dodgy,"I was initally excited about reading this book as I am a fan of vampire novels and mystery/adventure, but I was sorely disapointed by the fact that this book had very little mystery or adventure in it and was based mostly around the sexual relationship of the main character with a vampire. There was some very unique and original images throughout, but all in all it fell kind of flat to me, in the sense that the plot was a little predictable. This being said I can see why someone else would like to read this book (or series)it just did not appeal to me."
3,One of the rare times when the show is better than the book,"If you love True Blood then you'll like this book even if it does give away a lot of the current plot line. However, if you love the CHARACTERS on True Blood then you won't like this book as much. The Sookie of the book is not the same intelligent, strong willed, caring person that you see on the show. The book Sookie, actually comes across at times as a dumb blonde. And I was floored that Tara, one of the best characters on the show, isn't in the book at all. The story is good and nice and juicy at times, but the writing is a bit weak."
4,Updating vampires for today's times,"Interesting update of the vampire story, set in the new South. Plot moves quickly and holds your interest."
2,Not what I expected,The characters are not developed well and it's hard to enjoy the character Sookie when she is so one dimensional.
5,Such soft sweet horror it brings a tear to my eye,"I have to admit that while I have a fondness for the whole vampire/werewolf/supernatural thing, sometimes it really seems kinda played out. I have such a fondness for this series - these characters - that it touches something in my heart that helps me remember that true childlike wonder and joy still exist in the world. Sookie Stackhouse is a wonderful combination of sugar, spice and grit. I love that she can be subjected to many very rough and horrible things, and yet never lose her innate sense of seeing the world for all the good in it. It almost breaks my heart when bad things happen to her and she just has to take it on the chin. This is easily one of my favorite series' currently going. The first time I saw the cover art, I swear I almost cried, it was just so...magical. There's a strange sense of awe and wonder I get when I read Charlaine's work, and I hope that she continues writing about this truly touching world for many years to come."
1,I lost IQ points after reading this book.,"Like other reviewers I had high hopes and really wanted to enjoy this series. However it is so poorly written that was impossible. The characters are underdeveloped to the extreme, we never know what's going on in their heads which made me so confused as to what was going on the majority of the time. It is essentially a poorly written smut novel so if that is your thing then have fun but otherwise don't waste your time."
2,Disappointed...,"I was ready to love this book. I bought it off the recommendations read on Amazon and began reading it with great anticipation. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed and actually ended up throwing the novel away when done. (I at least finished it--hoping it would be improve or have a fantastic ending) My main problem? It's definitely an ""ADULT"" novel--NC-17 rating at best if it was made into a movie due to the crude sexual and S&M scenes (plus violence, language, etc.) Not a book I would recommend to a friend, especially those under age. I wasn't expecting it to be ""erotic"" and felt it cheapened the characters and novel. The storyline was decent but with all ""adult"" crud mixed in, it ruined it for me. I don't have time in my life to read trashy novels. I was looking for a great story line, interesting characters, etc. I wish I had been warned on Amazon in the reviews. Fine if other folks want to read it but I would never had purchased it if I have know it was an ""adult"" novel."
3,"Just ""O.K.""","Fun read. Humor and suspense mixed with romance. However, I tried to like Sookie and Vampire Bill, but the characters just didn't quite make it to my heart. I certainly didn't see anything in Bill to sweep me off my feet. I will try the second in the series; sometimes improvement is seen as a series progresses."
2,Not sure why everyone likes this...,"I really don't understand why people are really into this book series ,.. I liked a few parts but it got boring and I start to lose interest fast."
1,"Not for everyone, I guess.","I was looking forward to purchasing this series of books, but couldn't get through the free first chapter offered by Amazon. Dissapointed, but will check out the TV series."
3,Sorry Sookie...,For me I just could not get into this book.I walked past it and picked it up dozens of times. Finally I bought it.It just seems to be going so slow. I am a little over half way and I hope I can make it through the book.I really hope something happens that makes me like the book as much as others seem to.I am just not feeling the love. Sorry Sookie.
4,"Silly, sometimes annoying, but",It sucks you in then before you know it you are doing everything in your power to read Harris book you can manage to get your hands on
2,I'm on the fence with this one,I didn't like this book but also I didn't really not like it. I can't think of anything in it that I really enjoyed other then the kind of hinted at love triangle. I think I am going to read book two just to see if they get better. Can't really explain why I am intrigued with them. They aren't my usual style. I thought it was a little raunchy not really romantic at all. I think I kind of like Sookies character and I want to know what happens with her. To see how this whole Bill Sam thing works out. I would only suggest this book to certain good humored friends.
3,It was all right,"After having read Laurell K. Hamilton's series, this seemed like my next bet. I confess it was slightly disappointing. The dialogue often seemed forced, and the plot was a thinly veiled - a rather pale copy of Anita Blake. There was no tension between Bill and Sookie because Harris allowed them to jump into bed without resistance within the first hundred or so pages and everything fell so neatly into place. When Sam turns out to be a shapeshifter, I couldn't help comparing it, again, to the Anita Blake series. Don't get me wrong...it was interesting, but it wasn't ""WOW!"""
2,Not what I was hoping for,"Considering the rave review I was given of Harris' work, I was greatly disappointed. The characters are dull and stereotypical, and the plot is flat and underdeveloped. It's ""charm"" seems to be its Southern setting, and I guess I'm just not southern enough to enjoy it."
4,A fun read,"Just like the Anita Blake series, this book is another fun and enjoyable read. Though it may have some similarities to the work of Laurell K. Hamilton, I think this story can more than hold its own when compared to the Anita series."
4,A Long Awaited Treat,"I've had this book in my possession for some time and had been anxious to read it because my coworkers had been raving about it. Unfortunately, I had already watched the first season of True Blood so I had to wait.There are some differences between the tv series and the book, which is great, but it doesn't change the fact that it sucks to already know 'who'd done it' at the end of the story when the killer is revealed.Still, I rate this book 4 stars because although I already knew most of the story, it didn't fail to keep me entertained and maintain my interest. I had been looking for a gripping story to read and was pleasantly surprised to find it here.It's funny, quirky, serious and sexual. I recommend everyone to grab a sample read - the way it's written is light and entertaining, but I caution some readers due to its sexual content."
4,Another great addition to the series!,Charlaine does it again! I can hardly contain myself while I wait for the next book.
4,Fun vampire fiction,"I was afraid that this was going to be totally cheesy, like Twilight was. I'm so glad I was wrong! Dead Until Dark is a fun book...a mystery and a romance all rolled together with a generous helping of vampires.I like the fact that Harris didn't go crazy with her vampires and make them so utterly ridiculous that they distracted from, rather than helped, the story along. (Stephenie Meyer, I'm talking to YOU!) While I did find Sookie (wtf kind of name is that?) a bit on the hokey side, she was a character you could relate to.I'm looking forward to reading other books in this series."
3,A vampire romance for grown-ups,"Sick of Edward Cullen whining about how he's such a monster, who can't drink human blood and can't have sex? Read this. It's a vampire romance for grown-ups."
4,Dead Until Dark,"I found myself laughing out loud while reading quite a few times. I think my favorite term in the book is 'fang banger', which are vampire groupies basically. I liked the love scenes and found this book had just the right dose of romance, humor and mystery. I like Sookie's character and found her to be smart, funny and sassy. I like Bill too, and wanted the two to get together right from the start.My one problem with this book was that I liked but didn't love Bill. I don't think his character was that strong, I like my heroes to be memorable. When I think about favorite literary vampires, Bill will not be on my top favs. I would consider reading the second installment in this series though."
2,I wanted to like this book but...,"I don't know what I was expecting when I bought the first Sookie Stackhouse novel. My introduction to this series came from the HBO show, True Blood and I can easily say that it was more enjoyable than this book. The book obviously is for adults but it came off as childish and underwhelming. I was dying, no pun intended, for some of the elements of the televsion show to come into play to liven this book up but saldy, they never came. I think I'll check out season 2 of True Blood when it comes out but pass on the 2nd novel by Harris."
2,"If she was a lit major, im a brain surgeon!","I guess the story of the book is entertaining enough. Im a pretty big fan of the hbo show True Blood and decided to read the 1st book after watching a good chunk of the season. Although the show is entertaining but definitely has its cheesy parts, the book is just as bad. I think the thing that really gets me is this author really is an extremely horrible writer, even if she is trying to take on the southern style of the narrator."
1,Too much like other series...,"This book/series probably could have been good, but its just too much like every other vampire series out there. It doesn't really have anything that sets it apart or makes me want to keep reading.A cute vampire, a strong and independent woman with a talent that sets her apart, murders... its all been done before. I got to around page 60 and lost complete interest. Especially when out of the blue for no apparent reason the heroine decides to go investivate murders. Where in the world did that urge come from? She didn't even like the women that were killed!I started this series because it was high on the Amazon sci-fi/fantasy best seller list, but I won't be going any further. Maybe I'll give it another try when the vampire/romance market becomes less saturated.If you want a good vampire series, I suggest Anita Blake Vampire Hunter."
4,Reading in between black dagger brotherhood,"I'll admit that I'm obsessed with vampire romance novels. I haven't been able to find anything to read in between Black Dagger Brotherhood novels. It was actually getting quiet irritating reading 50 pages of a book and putting it down forever. Thank goodness for Sookie Stackhouse. Being from the South has its full advantages when reading this series. The ""War of Southern Aggression..."" come on...thats just hilarious. This book takes a little getting used to reading, but after the first couple of chapters, you have to know what happens. It is also good to read if you are just getting into romance novels because the love scenes are not quiet as graphic as some other series. All in all, a light, humourous read. Plus, the second and third books are even better!"
5,LOVED IT!!!,loved this book got the series started off GREAT!! i love the vamp theme & sam :) i love that she has a brother like jason & vamps are out in the open.. TRUE BLOOD!!
2,Just ok,Wasn't very easy to use and there were a lot of pieces to keep track of. I'd only recommend for serious magic goers.
3,Some great material - but not for the Terry Southern neophyte,"Terry Southern's NOW DIG THIS is a grab bag of his miscellaneouswritings including short stories, letters, interviews and much more.Those of us who savored THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN and CANDY as well as his contributions to DR. STRANGELOVE might find this appealing; however it may not be for the Terry Southern neophyte. This offering seems to be a kind of clean-out-the-leftover- files book, and thus whileit may appeal to the Terry Southern diehard, it may not be for all takers. Nevertheless, there is some great material here."
5,Hank is back. Best work in years. Excellent investment.,"This new CD is the best. Hank has recaptured the magic that made him a superstar in the 80's. The only thing that can hold this album back from being a number 1 is if radio doesn't play it. It is an excellent effort. Fans will have to call the radio stations and request the new single ""They all want to go wild"". I am a fan, but I am also realistic. This album shines."
1,The Most Incorrectly Named Cookbook Ever,"If your idea of a great crockpot cookbook is one which allows you to throw in a few fresh ingredients and come home to a savoury aroma and a great meal - then this book is not for you. It has more pre-packaged, processed, canned and preserved ingredients than I have ever seen in a cookbook. Also, many of the meals take a few hours on low - no good if you need to have things cooking while you're at the office. This book was one huge disappointment."
1,"disappointing, not worth the money, worst slow cookbook ever",Book is not really geared to the every-day houswife. Good basic everday dishes just aren't there. The desserts and beverages I will make in the slow cooker are far and few between. Personally I need meat mainstay menus.
5,Fabulous easy recipes for those work-to-carpool days,"This cookbook helps get the maximum use from your slow cooker. Special advice on use of seasonings and cooking times results in unique and delicious meals. Crock meals are a great way to improve nutrition for families with kids who eat at odd hours because they're teenagers or involved in activities. This book uses up-to-date frozen and prepared ingredients for added convenience, and has fun ethnic and dessert recipes."
1,Not what it was stated as.,The pendant was not solid and had a hollow sound to it when you tap it on your teeth it sounds like tin. In the picture shows that the pendant is two-sided but when we got it only one side has a St. Michael's on. I don't mind that but only rattles sounds tinny on my gold chain.
3,One year old book on AOL is already dated,"This was a good book, I am sure, when it came out. Now there is a great package, AOL Press, that is not mentioned in the book. This software allows someone to use WYSIWYG for publishing your web page and it is free. I do not know if the software can be used on other sites for uploading web pages"
2,Not any better than the ordinary impact wrench,I have a one ton Dodge boom truck with a flat. I have an impact wrench that will loosen most everything I have attempted to loosen except for the lug nuts on the Dodge truck. I borrowed a friends and his wouldn't loosen the lug nuts. So I began my research for a new one that would do the job. I settled on the Aircat 1000th. The reveiws indicated it would bust nuts. I bought two. It wouldn't budge the nut. I tried it once and was dissatified. Attempted to return the two and was informed that I couldn't return the one I had used even though it was used once. They recommended that I send it to the repair center to have it checked out. I did send the second one back and got credit. But I still have the one that does not bust nuts. I might try it on a pecan.Boudreaux
5,Sensitive memoirs from a witness to history...,"The incredible, gripping autobiography of author Lehmann, the ""last courier"" to Adolf Hitler in his infamous bunker, tells his story with sensitivity and brave candor. This large volume is constantly fascinating for WW2 enthusiasts, especially because of his unique perspective as a German ""insider."" Lehmann's wit and wisdom are apparent throughout and one particular paragraph stood out for me as a summation of his message: ""How difficult it must be for all those who live in a democracy, used to a free press and to open exchange of opinions, used to a multiple-party system or, at least, to a two-party system, to understand the one track mind of youth in a dictatorship."" Eye opening and candid, this is work of passion and immense detail...not to be missed. It will change the way you look at film of the masses...to realize that every face has a name and a story all his/her own. Especially timely with our current global turmoil."
1,Too much hype,"I had trouble getting through the first few pages of this book. Its written more like a B movie script, than a good Sci-Fi series. The main character uses an inner monologue to describe the past events and build on the actual plot line. Poorly written and bad contrasting and use of scenery. Steer clear if you want something with substance."
1,Terrible,"I couldn't even finish this book. The author repeats facts dozens of times, the characters do EXACTLY what you can predict them to do, the character interactions aren't believable, ad nauseum.These books would be good if you were 15."
4,"Not as good as original, but still good!","My five year old has discovered Dennis the Menace. While I love the original movie, my daughter LOVES this one!! It's very cute and entertaining, which is all that matters to me. She'll watch it over and over."
2,What 100V - 250V adapter?,"A nice little gadget, as long as you download the most recent firmware; although I was utterly disappointed with the error that Linksys put in their specs for this product. They stated that the supplied power adapter had a voltage range of 100V to 250V - utter rubbish. I only bought it to use for 240V in Europe and have had to go well out of my way to find it an alternative power source. Also there is no MacIntosh driver, however it is possible to configure the device through a web browser. They also fail to mention that the hard disc that is to be used with the device ought to be formatted by the device before use; download the latest firmware to get round this problem and it all 'sort of works okay'. Good luck."
1,No advance WARNING before purchase on severe limitations,"1) The Linksys Storage link does not allow WINDOWS formatted hard drives to be hooked in. That means you LOSE all data on the hard drive you plan to network. This is not explained anywhere in the sales hype (including at Amazon -- shame on you!)2) The SETUP does not work per their instructions. The hard drive will need formatting, and if not formatted in advance it does not recognize the hard drive. I was on the phone with a tech for 1:40 to sort out how to find the formatting instructions, as the provided information does NOT include any help.3) EXTREMELY poor documentation."
2,"Nice idea, poor execution","I really want to like this product. The ability to connect one or more drives to the network and be shared by computers on the network is a wonderful thing. The set-up was fairly easy, speed to copy is acceptable and can even be accessed via a Mac.However...When copying more than 10 gb, the connection will drop. You need to start the copy over again and only move 10 files at a time. Tedious to say the least.Tech Support has offered no working solutionSometimes you cannot connect to the drive without changing the device IP address.Crashes the accessing machine when encountering a problem.Nice idea but the engineering is poor."
1,the worst gadget i ever bought,"updates from linksys breaks the device and removes features i am not using it anymore, it also generally performs a lot slower than the bandwidth attached to it"
2,Not What I Expected,"I bought this to stream media from my hard drive, I have yet to accomplish this task. Partly because I don't have time and partly because this is a huge pain to set up. The storage link uses its own format for your hard drive. you must take everything off the hard drive and format it through the Internet. This takes forever, I have attempted it multiple times without success yet. Linksys needs to send a disc that will actually format the drive with the storage link. I am sure this would be a nice device if only I could get my drive to format. As of now, I am still looking into how to format it.. Will update this once resolved."
3,This is not a consumer product for the home market,"There is a small but growing community of people world-wide who are using this device as a very low-cost, low-power Linux box. If you are buying this for that purpose, it's a great product. I love it for what it is.I would not recommend this to anyone who is not a Linux hacker enthusiast or a professional network administrator. Mine did not work at all until I plugged in a new USB 2.0 flash drive (it didn't even appear on my network with just a USB 1.1 external hard drive attached to it). The documentation, such as it is (mostly on the CD that comes with the device), frequently defaults to such helpful suggestions as ""if this doesn't work, see your network administrator.""In my experience, it is a lot easier to buy a second hard drive and install it in your PC than to setup one of these on your home network."
1,DANGER! NOT WINDOWS COMPATIABLE,"There is no documentation of this until you receive the device. The device requires a USB hard drive which is clearly stated. What it does not state is in order to use this hard drive it must be reformated for Lenix and will no longer work if plugged directly into a Windows machine or if there is exisiting data on the hard drive, it must be removed, reformatted and returned!Very disappointing."
1,Beware...,"I have had my NSLU2 for three months. It stopped working after 2.5 months. Sent it back for warrenty repair, Quality Assurance found nothing wrong with it, they shipped it back to me. It still did not work. Hours on the phone with Linksys Tech support to get new RMA to ship unit back. It's a great unit when it works, but BEWARE! Once you format the disk on your external hard drive to use the NSLU2, there is no going back to simply plugging in your external hard drive to your computer...so I have had no acces to my external hard drive for several weeks now...if I could go back in time, I would not have purchased this unit..."
2,"Good concept, poor customer service","The concept is good - but Linksys customer support is - at best - inadequate. After my unit failed while under warranty, only seven months after I bought it new, I contacted their customer support service. Their customer service appears to work in only one speed - slow - taking days to respond to emails if they even respond. After they agreed to replace my unit under warranty, it took them just about two months to ship me a working replacment. Consider their support if you want to think about using this unit to back up critical files."
4,SKIP'S REVIEW,The devise was very easy to set up and configure on all computers in the network. Mapping the drives after configuration was simple also.
3,another linksys product in work,"like one of the other reviewers i purchased a seagate drive and guess what after a few hours with tech support, who really did not understand the product, figured out that it only really supports the maxtor drives. the drive works well with two of my computers but will lock up one of my xp pro machines whenever i try to download to the drive. forget even trying to work that one with linksys tech support. i give the product three stars because the price is right and it does work with two of my machines very well. just remember to buy the maxtor drive to go with it and not any other product (i tried USB IDE adaptor as well without success.) Like some of the other reviewers figure an upgrade to the OS will eventually become available from some one other than linksys.as a side note i really like linksys because of the inovative products they produce. you just have to be prepared to go it alone sometimes if you want a leading edge product."
5,The Cater Street Hangman,I have been reading Anne Perry's Thomas and Charlotte Pitt mystery series. This movie gave me some faces to put with my reading.
1,Blast! I bought this stack and am experiencing a high failure rate!,These things seem to work ok when they start recording and then the machine stops after half an hour or so. They keep failing. I do not know what is different about these.
1,I absolutely can't recommend SIGG!,"My daughter bought bottles for my wife and I Xmas of '08. Mine a SIGG, hers another brand. Very cool looking and I have used it regularly. Unfortunately, the inside of mine has corroded badly, the competitors bottle (I think Klear Canteen) is still perfect. They refused any help other than routing me to their ""30%-off"" sale items on their website. I'm shopping for a non-SIGG replacement now!!!!"
2,Can not clean inside these deep v-shape threads,"The top uses very fine threads that can't be cleaned. After 10 minutes with a tooth brush there is still gunk in the threads. I think it gets forced into the deep ""V"" in the thread when you close the cap. Better bottles use larger shallow round bottom threads. Also the plastic coating is, well plastic. They do look nice and hold up to abuse. And I don't think the gunk in the threads will kill you because you can turn it into sterile gunk if you soak it in bleach. But it looks bad even at arm's length I can see it."
1,Inner Liner Flakes,"I bought two of these bottles. Within 6 months the inside liner started flaking off around the cap. They wont tell me what the liner is made out of so I dont know what chemicals I consumed. For the price, I expected a longer life cycle."
2,Soemewhat disappointed,Looks are great. Item dents very easily - do not remember dropping it and there are new dents. Does not keep water cold. Top must be on tight to keep water from leaking. Top inconvenient to open and close (many turns). Difficult to clean - requires brushing. Very overpriced for thin aluminum cylinder. Either price comes down to $5 or this is a quick fad.
5,clean water,I love my new Sigg water bottle! It's easy to carry on the go and the water tastes so much better than when I used the plastic water bottles. I've gotten tons of compliments on the design as well.
1,mislead by Sigg,"I bought a Sigg years ago to avoid the BPA liner, only to find out they had one. They promised me a new bottle w/out the liner, but when I finally was able to mail it back, they said they weren't giving people new ones anymore. Dishonest marketing and dishonest promises."
2,The bottle makes a lot of noise and it scratchs easly.,The bottle makes to much noise and the outside gets scratch easily. It is a high price for an average quality product.
5,Welcome summer!,"I love this book. It is full of great stories and recipes--from the Blueberry Pie recipe on page 108 to the Lobster Roll recipe on page 209 and all of the other 70 recipes that are scattered throughout the 240 pages of this book. Rebecca covers everything: the history behind the food,the restaurant, and her family; she gives helpful tips so you can recreate the dishes easily at home--THERE IS NO BOOK OUT THERE THAT CAN COMPARE. It's not just another boring cookbook, it is an adventure."
5,SUMMER IN MAINE,"BEING FROM THE MIDWEST I HAVE DEVELOPED A LOVE OF THE OCEAN, ESPECIALLY THE SHORES OF MAINE. I HAVE BEEN TO MAINE ON SEVERAL SUMMER TRIPS. NOW IT ZERO OUTSIDE WITH A WIND CHILL OF 20 BELOW. (NATIVE CHICAGOIANS CALL IT THE HAWK) EVEN MY BULLDOG DOESNT WANT TO GO OUT. SO, I HAVE JUST PURCHASED THIS BOOK AND I AM IMMEDIATELY TRANSFORMED. IT FEELS LIKE IT IS JULY AND I AM AT THE SHORE. SO I GET OFF MY COUCH (MY BULLDOG DOESNT EVEN WANT TO GET INTO THE CAR) GO TO THE LOCAL FISH HOUSE, PICK UP A POUND OF LOBSTER MEAT AND MAKE A ROLL. I MAKE A PITCHER OF THE HOME MADE LEMONADE AND HAVE A FEAST. I CANT WAIT UNTIL THE BLUEBERRIES GO BELOW SEVEN DOLLARS A PINT SO I CAN MAKE THAT BLUEBERYY PIE. GREAT READ IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER."
4,got lucky,The only reason that it arrived with all 8 screws is because I also ordered a magnet. They were all stuck to it after the packaging failed. True story.
2,Pop goes the weasel!,"I believe I have learned a lesson in ""you get what you paid for"" with these condoms. I believe half of the ones I used broke. I guess I can use the rest as water balloons."
2,"OK for snow cones, not a true ice shaver","I purchased this as an upgrade from my hand cranked ""Hawaii ice"" shaver and am *very* disappointed. I don't know why the previous reviewer said you could make fine or coarse ice. There's no adjustable blade and the resulting ice is OK for snow cones and to fill drinks with, but cannot truly be called shaved ice."
1,Stopped working after 20 seconds. JUNK!,I received this as a gift and did not use it until after a year with the children. It works for 20 seconds then it stopped. It just made buzzing sound when the top is pressed. It is a JUNK!
1,Excuse me?,"What is wrong with book? Don't ALL releigions practice ""mind control"" and not just these ""cults"". Christianity does mind control. As well as Judism, Buddhisma and ALL RELIGIONS! If you are not Christian or any other major religion then I gaurentee you will find this book to be one of the most offensive documents ever written."
5,"Sensitive, Intelligent and Truthful","A former member of a small New Age Cult in New Jersey, I spent all of 1997 trying to figure out what really happened to me after almost twenty years of involvement. Mr. Hassan's book was a turning point. It helped me define my prior circumstances and gave me permission to declare unequivocally that I had indeed been seduced into a genuine cult. The book is reader friendly and yet psychologically and intellectually precise. Most of all, Mr. Hassan's sense of humanity shines between the lines. Thank You for helping us, your readers, understand and begin to heal."
1,Needs more substance,"I only read about the first one-third of this book before I realized that this book was written for someone who had once been deeply involved in a dangerous cult. If you are looking for a general book about mind control and how to understand it from an academic perspective, this is not the book in my opinion even though the author states that the book will show you how to ""fight the battle"" against mind control."
5,Willpower in a bottle,"If you follow the program to the letter, and you're really serious about quitting, this is the way to go. Um, if you have constipation, say goodbye to that."
5,Awesome!!!,Awesome! Roseanne classic!Can't wait for Season 5 and 6 to come out!!!Any ideas when that would be??
3,Best Country Poet and Songwrite Ever,Not one of his best albums ever made but still a good one to have for your Red Steagall Collection
5,Love Of The West - Red Steagall,"This is such a great CD. I listen to it one track at a time - to savor them. You have to listen, because Steagall has things to say. Best tracks are: Red River Rose, and The Day The Songbird Died. This CD is for the romantics among us."
4,Makes the railway better,With this set you are able to send the train out of the room and back again- I've been using that to teach our two year old how trains really work and what they actually do- transport things. I put a bit of food or something in one of the cars and send it along to where my boy is waiting... he had no interest in the track really till we got this set.
4,Works with more generic train table sets.,"Fun addition and many useful track pieces. I like the splitters and the double male end, they should add a double female end too."
4,Great for expanding layouts,Quality construction and good mix of track types makes this a very useful expansion pack. Our layouts have grown and allow more players to be involved.
2,This much for that much??!,Yikes. I was so surprised at the size of the bottle. I had no idea it would be that small for the price. The scent is nice but I would not reorder.
5,A Very informative book.,"This book is jam packed with pottery marks, a great value for the price. I had no idea that there were so many. It is extremely informative, giving a brief history, manufacture dates and much more information for each company listed. I would definately recommend this to anyone with an interest in collecting or selling pottery."
1,Didn't like it at all,"I really enjoyed Crimson Petal and the White but was very disappointed by this book. It wasn't the writing, because I find Michael to be a page turner. Just not my cup of tea. I didn't like the subject matter at all. Too ""out there"" for me."
4,I think I liked it....,"For some reason I couldn't put this book down. It intrigued me from the start. I wanted to know why this strange girl was traveling around Scotland in search of muscular hitchhikers. I'm not sure that I completely understood this book. I think this is one of those novels that you must read more than once to grasp what the author is trying to get at. Here, you have this young disfigured woman traveling around in her little red Corolla injecting big muscular hitchhikers with something, so that they can have horrendous things done to them and then be shipped who knows where. I would have liked a little more information near the end because as much as I liked it, I felt I was left hanging."
3,A great idea put to average use,"The idea of this book is really good and in my opinion quite original but unfortunately Michel Faber doesn't do as much with it as you could have wished for. The gradual introduction of the characters and the environment is really interesting but all of a sudden the book ends and you realize that there was never really any plot.This book is almost pure description and hardly any story and it is such a shame because it would have made a brilliant book if it had been developed further. Instead it reads more like the author sitting down for coffee with you and describing this really cool idea he has just had for a book he might write one day. I'm hoping that he actually does that one day because the idea really is good (it's impossible to actually describe it because that would spoil the book - sorry :)). ""Under the skin"" is definitely worth reading if you can just overlook the lack of plot and see it as a very interesting description instead."
2,"""On Christmas Day"" Image submitted by Brenda","Although it is better than nothing, and has different cover art than the CD I own, which some may prefer, the quality of this scan can be greatly improved. I would suggest that Brenda resubmit the cover art for this disc with the following tips in mind: (a) Try scanning in color if possible, (b) remove the sheet or booklet on which the cover art is printed from the jewel box before scanning the image, and (c)edit the scan by cropping the image so that the bits of the jpg file are full of the desired image rather than the background of the entire glass on the surface of the scanner to create the final image."
4,Gift for my granddaughter,I like this and also made a cd of the mp3 to give to my granddaughter since it wasn't available in cd format. She seems to be pleased. I think some of the music is a little weird.
5,A must for Ironman training,I had done 5 Ironman before reading this book and my time were always around 12:15. Following the principle I broke my 12hrs barrier advanced 45min from my personal best. I will recommend this book to any intermediate to advance Ironman athlete.
2,same old story,"Really, two stars might be a bit generous. If you've ever subscribed to Runner's World, or Triathlete Magazine, or read another book on triathlon, you are not going to get much new from this book. It merely re-inforces what you already know, so don't hope for any breakthrough information."
3,S'Ok,"I actually started with the new Breed Series books and then went back to catch up with the 1st books in the series. I'm glad I started at the end in this case, because I dont think I would have continued on. The newer books (Mercury's Warrant and Coyote's Mate are very good 4* books to me.)This book is too inconsistent. The characaters dont engage us enough to care about them. It started out really well with a very interesting plot and seemingly interesting characters, then just died off..into a WTF just happened kind of story. Erotica yes, a good plot driven story with some great sex scenses, not."
3,I got what I expected,"I've read all of the Breed books and I have enjoyed them all. Anyone complaining about the lack of plot and the explicit capture/bondage like sex scenes must not have realized what they were buying. Both lead characters are attracted to each other and there is no forced sexual tension. The chemical reaction can only happen with the person that is supposed to be the breed's mate. With that said, I liked Meghan's Mark, but I would have liked some closure from Aiden's Charity. I will, however, continue to read Lora Leigh's work."
1,series is not in order waste of money,i want to read a series in order this book says its the first but its really number 7 but number 7 was published in 2006 when the first book was 2009 when i read a series i want the books to be in order
2,Not the best book....,"....I have ever read. Not the worst either. But I didn't enjoy it. I see that alot of the other reviewers thought it was great, but, I guess it was just not to my taste. Bummer is I bought it new. (lol)I am not going to go on with the series...why throw good money after bad?"
5,A really big dress watch,"A nice solid dress watch for folks like me who work for a living.. not for rich folks. Sports an attractive, almost art deco face. However, the purchaser should be informed that Fossil is not kidding when it says the watch is ""oversized."" The face measures approximately 1 1/16 X 1 5/16. However, if you have a lot of watches, this model will be a pleasant variation. Fossil did not get the highest customer satisfaction ratings, but they have always delivered promptly and securely when I ordered. Maybe I am lucky. But Amazon does an excellent job at mediation. So, I would presume, you can order this timepiece with confidence."
4,Out of the Ordinary,"If you've read too many formulatic romance novels, this is a wonderful example of a writer who is not limited by genre. The characters are well written, and it displays life as true to form: messy sometimes, unpredicatable and occasionally devestating. Most women will be able to sympathize with Honey's acting out and teenage confusion. I would recommend this book to anyone tired of your typical bodice-ripping romance."
4,This book began a quest for me to get and read all the rest.,"This book is so fast paced, that you can not put it down. The characters are human, funny, real. There are so many quirky details in the writing that it becomes very psycologically convincing. You are there. For example, there is one sceen where a dusty footed girl gets angry and kicks somebody who's giving her a hard time in the shins - she's wearing thongs. Tell me that doesn't make your toes ache for her. I love this book best of all of her tales. I loved Honey Moon, and the time that I spent with her. I was lonely for her at the book's end."
1,Burn & Go Gold,"It's a total waste of precious time & money! I've installed & uninstalled the software over & over again thinking I was doing something wrong where in reality the software shouldn't be on the market. My computer froze up so many times, I had to reinstall Windows. Luckily I got everything back on track. I emailed their technical support, but of course I was referred to a different web site which I didn't bother with. I removed it from my system forever!"
3,Had to return RoadPro,"When I received my RoadPro, it had a high pitched squealing sound when it ran at low speed. I had to return it. I will review again when I receive the replacement. Amazon has a fantastic return policy, Thanks."
4,It rocks,"Plain and simple, this is one of the best hard rock albums of the year. Richard Patrick is not Trent Reznor, but he certainly has his own brand of talent that cannot be denied. Filter can go from crushing guitar and modulated screams to acoustic melodies and introspective lyrics without missing a beat or sounding cheesy. Hats off to them for taking the time to make a decent second album... bands like Limp Bizkit could learn a thing or two."
5,Absolutely surprising,"My knowledge of the band Filter is very limited. I remember their single Hey Man Nice Shot a few years ago, but I believe that was their only hit song. So when their new album, Title of Record debuted a few weeks ago I didn't think much of it. Then a few days ago a local radio station played their new single: Take a Picture. Wow. What a song. Loved it. It took me by complete surprise that this band could play such beautiful sounding music. After a great deal of thought I purchased the album. All I can say is Filter has completely outdone themselves. This is a rock album that will remain in my CD player for quite a while. Other great tracks include: The Best Things, Captain Bligh and I Will Lead You. If you are considering this album as your next musical acquisition, go with your instincts. Buy it. Really and truly there isn't a bad song to be found."
4,Couldn't Sleep- had to get online and buy it.,"I heard this one evening on some alternative station and it stuck. The track ""Take a Picture"" is really hot and melodic. I hope that these guys take the response to this to heart and make more music like this. The lyrics are a little too far out but the melody is enough to make them at least a one hit wonder. I'm not much of a fan of the other stuff but this one track made me buy the CD."
5,the best things...,"This is the essential CD to own. Never have I been more impressed with the content of each and every song a group puts out. If you buy it for ""Take a picture"", great, but get ready to be blown away. Richard Patrick seems to touch every emotion from a loathing love to forgiveness with his lyrics. I swear it is the best 12 bucks you'll ever spend..."
3,not as good as i thought,"As did alot of people, I bought this album for the song ""Take a Picture"", and was slightly disappointed with the rest of the content. I had to listen to it a couple of times for me to get kinda into it. But, it definetly wasn't the winner that I had anticipated it to be."
3,A good alternative to pyrotechnical superfluous flailing,"At first, I thought this was a very mediocre album. However, it has grown on me, and now I play it over and over. The overall playing of all the musicians is simple and uninspired, but that may be why this album is so easy to listen to repeatedly.Although this album does not evoke much emotional response, it does offer some subtle lessons to the aspiring B3 grinder. In particular, Wilson uses nicely chosen chordal voicings and passing chords, and he plays very solid bass lines.Finally, there is no demanding sonic overload or the superfluous flailing of some present day organ grinders, who seem to offer virtuosity merely for virtuosity's sake.Also, for an energetic and inspired live B3 recording, you might consider Groove Holmes' ""On Basie's Bandstand""."
5,Very well written,"This book is excellent reading. The author focuses on the important aspects of an austere, but to the bone honest man. This iis a page turner frm start till the end."
5,excellent for heavy chewers,I bought this product because I had purchased other Nylabone products. This has the durability one expects with Nylabone. We use it for fetch as well as one of his favorite chew toys. I have purchased more because he likes to hide them. Excellent for heavy chewers.
2,High hopes; wasted money,"My dog likes round rawhides, so I tried this as an alternative. He refused to use it.I'll be donating it to the local animal rescue group. Hopefully a dog that's less picky will get some use out of it."
3,Meh.. love/hate relationship with these,"My dogs did love these right off the bat but got tired of them within a couple days. Even after I put them away for a while and then re-introduced these, my two dogs (60lb shephard/lab mixes) didn't feel all too keen on them over time. They chew through many things like their life depends on it so I purchased these rings due to their durability. However, the nylabone material hardens and becomes very ""spiky"" that gets caught in my pups' teeth when ripped off and punctures my skin when accidentally stepped on."
5,Finally Chicana Lady on cd,"I took my wife to a concert with Joe Bataan this winter and heard him sing a song I had never heard. My wife made me look all over and I couldn't find it. My wife and I looked all over until finally I found it on Amazon. ""Chicana Lady"" is the song and my wife was happy when it arrived. We are in are early 30's and have not heard all of Joe Bataan's songs. This cd is awsome it had two new songs, and four rare songs. After we heard the other songs on this cd my wife fell in love with this cd. This will make a great addition if you collect oldies. I had never heard ""Chican Lady"", ""What Good is a Castle"" or ""Poor Boy"" great songs. It also has my all time favorite song ""My Cloud"" what more could I ask for. I can sit back now with my chicana girl and enjoy this great cd for many years to come."
1,Drivel,This book is not for Civil War buffs. I think I might have lost a few IQ points from reading this drivel. Ellis writes like a teenage girl (with comparable grammar to boot.) The plot is completely predictable and the situations in the book are unrealistic. Don't waste your time or money.
1,what a waste!,"i purchased this receiver because I once had one exactly the same but I gave it away as a gift , so i was looking for another one for myself, but the only one I foud was this one (an used one by the way) so i took the chance to buy it, the receiver not only took five weeks to be delivered but it was not working properly, I connected my computer to the aux, my turn table to the phone input, and I played them, but the receiver did not make any change to inputs but played them all at the same time, and an hour after ther that stopped working , so I flushed $115 away, and I have no warranty at all, so Am i upset about this? yes, I am, I never had any problems before buying on amazon, but this was completely wrong, you guys should not allow anybody to sell used stuff, next time I buy something, I'll make sure it's new!"
2,"Not too bad for a lawyer, I suppose....","I am a physician; so there is nothing I like better than taking a couple of potshots at anything the lawyer-types write. This novel is no exception. I mean, the premise is a good one; you know...a small town public defender-idealogue who goes up against the morally bankrupt and along the way falls emotionally head over heels for a pathologic liar who we know cannot ""kick the habit."" The author actually expects us to believe that this defendant will change overnight? Too fanciful, but readable nonetheless. Basically, I humbly ""plead the fifth"" on this dubious debut."
5,Excellent source for struggling stepfamilies!,"This book very clearly details the specific issues that my step family has been dealing with over the past three years. This is not a how-to book. However, it does offer much reassurance for stepfamilies who are struggling to define the roles within their familiy. The book states that the first two years are the hardest. That was wonderful to read. I thought our family was going break up because we weren't operating smoothly immediately. But just as the book describes, after two horrifically emotionally painful years, we turned a corner and the rewards are tremendous. This book is an invaluable resource for stepfamilies and easy to read to boot. My husband will tell anyone that I am the original tightwad, yet I am buying two copies to pass on to friends. Read it."
4,Interesting study results,Not sure this is what I was looking for when I purchased this book. It basically defines three types of step-families. I was looking for more of an advice book.
1,Not Tuff,"I own a toy by this maker, however it is in the shape of a Doughnut. It is rated a 9 on their tuff scale and my hound dog had the squeakers out in 1 hour......14.00 dollars is a lot to spend for 1 hour of entertainment."
3,Question,"How does this toy compare to the Ultimate Rings? I've tried the stuffed animal versions of these toys, but they never last as long as the rings. Does the Bowmerang hold up?"
1,NOT Tuff,My dog put a hole in it in less than a hour. He also pulled the stuff out of the other toy that took him 1/2 a day and that piece was rated @ 10 :{
1,Tuffy Dog Bowmerang,"I got this for my 25 pound poodle mix. He tore through it in less than a day (about an hour of play) and was pulling the stuffing out, and the squeakers. It's a shame because it's a fun toy for both canine and human. My dog truly loved it more than just about any toy he's ever had, and is beside himself since we took it away rather than let him leave a trail of stuffing through house. I know it says on the package ""There is no such thing as indestructible"" but it really should last more than a day."
5,As expected,Not much to say other than it fit and looks fine. I bought it to go with the Honeywell Aube programmable timer switch I ordered for home security purposes.
3,Standard size single gang decora plate,This is a standard size decora single gang faceplate in white. Screws are included. It is the same thing you could by at the hardware store for less than a dollar. You are buying it here for convenience. It is NOT the extra large variety (that cover up sloppy wall box installations).
1,Brittle and Overpriced,"I bought it with a timer as a ""just in case"" even though the timer was pictured with a plate. Well, no plate on the timer and this one is so brittle it cracks if you look at it wrong. Go to a big box store and buy an unbreakable one for half the price."
2,Too melodramatic.,"I am a music fan of this lady. I couldn't wait to buy her new CD for my growing music collection at home. Since I love variety, I was happy and anticipated adding her latest to my easy listening category. Unfortunately, I absolutely hate this CD. I wish I had returned it the next day but I was in deep denial that it was a bad as I thought it was the first time I scanned through it.I really tried to absorb what she was saying but the style was literally just ""too painful"" to listen to. ""You hurt me! why did you do it? You left me alone... etc"" Most artist sing about real life/love situations. However, if she's singing (in this case) ""talking"" about her personal experiences, I think she should seek therapy right away! In summary, this CD is too melodramatic, dark and dingy with little or no groove - not even a melow groove."
4,Deeply moving...,"I liked her previous album, Peace Beyond Passion. It's funky. The latest is a retreat from her funkiness. But still, this is a gem from Me'shell. My favorite tracks are Bitter, Beautiful and Grace. Her voice is deep and soothing. Lights out, lie down and feel her music. Great one!"
4,"""fool of Me"" evokes ""shadowboxer"" by fiona apple","In disagreement with the review about ""fool of me"" sounding like ""why"" by annie; i think that fiona's ""shadowbnoxer"" is more an apt comparison; it is thenatically and musically arrranged similiarily to ""fool of me"" and shows that me'sell can be one of the ""lillith girls""; she is as immensely talented in this regard."
3,Exquisitely depressing,"Unlike the driving, macho rhythmns woven heavy and tight, throughout Peace Beyond Passion, yet the same in M'degeocello's BITTER, the reliance upon thematic metaphors and stories, ever so familiar,lyrics of pain and bitter sadness,remain. Bitter only occasionally hints at what forces truly proliferate and impinge upon common sense shadowed beyond sensory belief....in the first and last cut....These are profusely elegant counterpoints touching down among controlled confusions. Meshell leads us to simultaneous body searches and soulful closets where we, who love her so...know M'degeocello obsequates. Her androGENIUS integrity and vaporous physical perfection remain whole albeit, sad. Meshell, do not give up! And she does not!"
2,Cheap,"The screws that came with this set didn't fit, so I had to find new screws. On top of that, one of the plastic inserts in the wheel reflectors broke while I was trying to install it. No directions and since this was my first time putting reflectors on a bike, this was frustrating. I mean, it isn't rocket science, but why not include instructions?"
4,The King of Cult Films,"CORMAN'S WORLD is a fun documentary about the Cinematic Czar of Cheap and his cult classics that, to much of my surprise, delivers a bevy of big name celebrities, but for all of its star-power fails to transcend its BBC or TLC made for cable format. I did have a great time watching this DVD and reminiscing about his body of work but was not stirred enough to pull a few Price/Poe films off the shelf. I would recommend this DVD to any film fan with the exception of the hardcore Psychotronic crowd who might find the subject matter overly familiar."
1,HORRIBLE,This toy was very BAD. i AM A 5 YEAR OLD KID AND GOT THIS FOR CHRISTMAS. it is soooooooooooooo loud. it was hot one night so i decided to turn it on. it was so loud i couldnt even sleep and ended up turning it off. my opinion is not to get his toy.
5,They Got The Word!,"I really love this song a lot. Iloved it after hearing the firstfew seconds. If it`s at all possible, I would like to have thewords to the song emailed to meso that I can sing along with themusic. I can`t understand what some of the words are. I have every cd this choir has made."
3,Not great audio quality but excellent show,"The audio is only 192 kbps, like a m√©dium quality mp3. Usually a high quality audio on dvd's is more or less 1400 kbps. i just do not understand why they give us fans this cheap audio. The show is incredibly strong and amazing, they are top musicians."
2,"Great Features, But Didn't Last Long","I really liked the functionality of this clock and would still be happily using it today, but the buttons to turn on the alarm wore out and became unusable after about a year. Because I liked the clock so much, I even opened it up to try and fix it myself, but wasn't able to.Because of the poor quality of the clock, I can only give it 2 stars.I ended up replacing it with another great clock from Sony which I've been very happy with:Sony ICF-C318 Clock Radio with Dual Alarm (Black)"
1,Don't recommend,"I bought this product for my 2007 Ford F-150 STX Model. I followed the directions to install it which were pretty easy but once I got it on and shut the door and of course it didn't fit. The door had about an inch and a half gap, so I don't recommend this product for this vehicle."
3,Yaz by Carl Yaztremski with Al Hirshberg,"The autobiography of Carl Yastrzemski, written right after the ""impossible dream"" seaso. The nstory of the son of a potato farmer, whose father maintained a semi-pro ball club to give Yaz a chance to play. 192 pages."
5,Great find!,"This was a book I needed to start a series, but it had been out for a few years. I couldn't find it any place else but here. I received it in only a matter of days. I was very pleased!!"
4,Better late than never,"I finally got this book after the deadline and the company was nice enough to credit my account. I enjoyed the book as I have enjoyed the other Drake Sisters books. It's a very fast read, story and characters could have been developed a lot more, but it was okay. I think Christine Feehan's books are slowly evolving into a better read. I really enjoyed her latest book Dark Hunter. I wish she would find another way to write her sex scenes or leave them out and let the reader's imagination take over."
4,I'm hooked on the Drake sisters!,"Magic in the Wind is a short story packed full of a great story line. After reading this, I purchased the rest of the Drake sister stories!"
4,"Could have been fleshed out more, but still very good","I read this book after reading the third book in the series, so perhaps I'm not as bothered by the details that were left out because they were provided in Oceans of Fire. I agree with others that Feehan could have fleshed this out more than she did, but it stands alone fine. As long as you know how short it is before you buy it, you'll be fine--and it might be better to read it after one of the other books in the series.As for the font, I didn't even notice it, and sometimes I won't buy a book if I think the font will give me a headache. If it had been bigger, I bet some reviewers would have complained that the publisher was trying to make the book appear longer than it was. Some people are never happy."
2,Magic in the Wind,"Having been a fan of Christine Feehan for a while, I was sorely disappointed with this book. The main characters did not have chemistry, in my opinion . The story did not allow enough time for them to build up a believable attachment."
5,Magic in the Wind,"It was in pristine conditon, awesome book...I've been collecting all of Christine Feehan's books, and that was the only one i couldn't find anywhere, but on amazon.com."
1,Don't be fooled,Re-written and expanded my left foot. The expanded part comprises of about 1 page of dialog and and additional scene. If you have the original story in the short story collection don't waste your $. The series is fabulous but this republished story was just a grab for more $.
5,Magic in the Wind,"Great book to read! Christine Feehan is a terffic writer. If you like paranormal, romance, and/or suspence than read this book. It will pull in from the first page."
3,Magic in the wind,This is an excellent author and a good series. The Drake sisters are cool.I enjoyed the book. Sarah seemed real.Kerngeorgia
5,Exciting!,"I love reading,any authors that write romance,supernatural,suspense and all of those combined...but I will say that Christine Feehan is my all time favorite author :)"
5,Another Great Photoflex Product,"I have a lot of studio lighting equipment. Photoflex delivers a solid reliable and well-functioning product every time--this time included.Provides exactly what a softbox should--soft even light.This size is ideal for portrait work, particularly if you add a strip light or grid spot as a hair light.Outstanding, period. There is no better price to value deal on the market."
2,Mud Blood and Poppycock,Poorly written and inaccurate. An insult to the British soldiers who died in 1916 onn the Somme
4,Very Good,First of the Sharpe's series for me. I enjoyed it very much and will certainly be reading many more of them.
1,"5 stars for Sharpes Rifles, 0 stars for Penguins Ebook pricing.","--I'm thinking that they must not want this e-book thing to work out if they want to price their ebooks $2 less than their print version, which is already inflated. It cost's them almost nothing to send you a digital copy of the book compared to print, price it accordingly. Many of Penguins books across the board are overpriced. I'm wondering if they realize how many copies of this book are floating around. I could probably hit a local used bookstore and pick up a copy for less than $4 right now. They need to come to their senses.--I'm not one of those idiots who thinks this stuff should be free, just realistic. The author and the company should have every right to charge you money for the book, but seriously make it reasonable or it will encourage people to look elsewhere for a copy that cuts out both the publisher and the author from their rightful earnings."
1,Stupid!,Why would anybody buy this book in the Kindle edition when it can be had in paper for half the cost? This is a ripoff and similar pricing policies will be what prevents Kindle from being a really great tool.
4,Lightsaber opinion,I bought it for my two brothers and they love it!!! I just do not know for how long is going to work properly with them playing and hitting everything.
5,COOOOOOLLLLLL!,This lightsaber is awasome it has sounds ligts up most of all it changes color Blue to red!
1,Number 2 Broken!!!,This is the second teapot that has arrived with the infuser broken! It is extremely disappointing! I would think that the company would reevaluate their packing.
2,Not As Good As Tiger Eye,I had to force myself to finish this book and with Tiger Eye I couldn't put it down. This one kind of left me flat. Not sure why. I just really couldn't feel for any of the characters. I very seldom have to force myself to finish a book. I hope the next one in the series gets back the excitement that Tiger Eye had.
5,Great.,This book is great. There are no flaws at all. It is a pretty simple read and very organized. Light and easy to carry around.
5,Absolutely adorable,"A sweet, simple romantic comedy... remember when musicals used to be that way? This may not be the most brilliant or sophisticated score ever written, and it owes heavily to Fiddler on the Roof, but it is still a delight. Well-produced, with good liner notes for those of us who haven't seen the show, this album is an excellent recording of a show which I suspect will become a small-theater staple for many years. Jennifer Rosin's Carolina is a particular standout, but the entire cast sounds wonderful. Hopefully, we will hear more from the Crystal/Engquist songwriting team."
2,Disappointing,"While there is a clear intelligence at work here, I was disappointed by these mannered and rather precious poems. Little is said here that hasn't already been said better and more interestingly by someone else. I'd like to see this author challenge himself more in future."
5,Remarkable Piece of Work,"Well, I must say. This book was passed on to me by a co-worker. I probably never would have purchased it, but I'm glad I had the chance to read it. The main character is really surreal. At first I liked her, then she erked me and I could not stand her, and then, I loved her. This writer takes the reader and the characters through vast levels. The assasination took me quite by surprise and I'm weary of coming in contact with a woman like her. The main character, gives a whole new meaning to a woman scorn. This book has what women think we want to read about, high tech weapons and espionage, but it also has what we men know we want to read about.. that's a hot passionate, steamy blood boiling love and heat this book generates.The sexual prowess of the main character was quite refreshing from a man's presepctive. Great reading."
5,A Loving Lullaby for Little Mischief Makers,Anne Mortimer does it again with this dear little book filled with her beautiful cat illustrations. The star of this story is a tabby kitten with a white bib and four white socks. We follow him through his busy day of mischief and exploration. The details and soft colors bring the kitten's world to life with such charm. Eileen Spinelli has written a text that can help to reasure any curious and mischievous little explorers that you may know that they are understood and cherished just as this lively kitten is.
1,Outlandishly overplayed hacking of a masterpiece,"The Pirates of Penzance is a masterful piece of work representing Gilbert & Sullivan at their finest. Unfortunately, this Stratford production neglects Sullivan's beautiful music by casting sub-par singers who make little attempt to stay in time with the orchestra, and slaughters Gilbert's brilliant text by throwing in as many outrageous bits of slapstick characterization as possible. Brent Carver's Pirate King barely had a line that wasn't interrupted by an uncomical tendency to get hung up on his words. The dancing dominates the show -- ballet fans may enjoy the Pirates in Tights who dance instead of Act. I am very disappointed by this particular production -- apparently an abberation, as the quality of the other Stratford G&S productions is far superior (particularly the Mikado)."
5,Revised Streetwise Athens Map,"Streetwise maps are the ones I use for travel both domestic and international. I think they are great, convenient to carry, precise and easy to use. Athens has changed a great deal since the last version had come out so the newly revised map is most welcome. I will certainly be bringing mine along when I revisit Athens next year."
3,Not like the photo,"I was a little leery of buying this item because of the cheap price (<25) and the height dimension, but i couldn't resist. The dimensions are actually correct and the photo is wrong. This cover only covers the top half of the grill. Its at least a foot shorter than shown in the photo.Other than that its appears well made and from a sturdy fabric. I liked the fact that its a light color and might last a little longer in sunny florida. The downside is that I expect it to show the dirt more"
3,Not the pump pictured and very noisy,"First, this pump is a very strong little pump, stronger than the 30gpm pump I was replacing. However, it's not the same pump as the picture. I needed the lower profile pump and the one I was sent is tall, rather that flat and wide. It's also very noisy. I hear way more pump than I hear burbling water, even with adjusting the flow. As other reviewers said, the cord is very bulky for such a small device. I will keep it as a backup pump, but I'm back to searching for one that is mostly silent."
4,"Excellent pump, though a bit loud","I purchased this as a replacement for my Drinkwell Fountain. It is not an exact match, but it does the job.The pump is very small. The description lists it correctly in size, but I was surprised at how small that really is!The cord is very sturdy. It is a bit thicker (5/16"") and longer than I expected. It is also a 3-prong grounded plug. Be sure your intended use can handle that thick of a cord.The pump is a bit loud. But given its superb function, I can get used to the hum."
5,Great Pump,"We have a small, three-tiered tabletop fountain. The original pump decided to stop working, so it was time to find a replacement. I ordered this pump and found it to be much quieter than the original. It has a switch for various flow rates. Our fountain used the lowest setting, which was perfect. There is quite a bit more volume that the pump could maintain. The cord is thick, but it fit our unit without need of finding a way to secure it. The suction feet at the pump base were sufficient to hold the base/cord in place. Great value and great service getting it to us."
3,Fountain pump,"I put this pump into an outdoor fountain to replace a broken one. It pumps OK, but don't expect much. It has limited power and does not pump fast even at the highest setting."
1,Don't buy this Cannon Case,"This is very poorly designed product. It hardly fits the camera. The cover doesn't close. There is no additional space/pouch to carry spare memory card/battery. Unless you want to use this only to protect from scratch, it is not worth it. Also retailer charge 10% stocking fee and accept only within 10 days."
4,Canon PSC-1000 leather case,"Great case. Lightweight, the camera fits in it perfectly, and it's easy to get out.The only complaint was they have what looks like a whole that you would put the wrist strap through, but when you do it's near impossible to get the camera out. Not sure what it's there for. We just let the strap come out of the side. But it keeps the camera safe."
3,Good but without extra storage space,"This is a good case for my camera (canon sd1000), the leather feels fine, is nice looking an seems durable. But I always have a spare battery for my camera, and I'd prefer that the case had a pocket for it, even if it became a little bigger.But if you don't carry another battery, I'll recommend it."
2,Camera case,"I'm not thrilled with this product. The case closes just fine without a camera in it, but once you put the camera in, the top will not stay closed, even though there is a magnetic closing. It's just too small."
1,Ugh - too big / thick,"I bought this case thinking it would fit my SD770 well. It's too big! Too bulky to put in a pants pocket.What's really frustrating is my wife bought a PSC-1000 case a couple years ago and it fits perfectly. Since then they've made the case an extra 1/4"" thicker and taller. If you have a SD-1000 or SD-770 this is not the case you want."
2,Fits too tightly,"This is a nice case, but it fits the camera too tightly. You can not easily close the flap (so the magnetic latch engages) when you have the wrist strap attached. The only option is to pass the wrist strap through the designated hole in the flap. But doing this will prevent you from quickly removing the camera from the case, requiring you to unthread the strap. This is unacceptable for a camera designed to be carried for anywhere/anytime photography.If you don't use the wrist strap, than this is a nice case. Sturdy, using good materials, and attractive. And, of course, it's your only choice from Canon."
3,I would not recommend purchase,"You cannot include an extra battery with using this case. If you take a lot of pix like I do, then this case is not for you.KathySan Diego, CA"
1,over priced small case,The camera case only fits the camera. No room for spair battery or memory card. It is also over priced for what you get. A poor choice on my part.
2,Did not fit Canon PowerShot SD1000 7.1MP Digital Camera,This case did not fit the Canon PowerShot SD1000 7.1MP Digital Elph Camera. It was too small. My son cut the top off for the camera to fit and clipped to his belt.
3,it's okay,"This case isn't bad. Some people say that it is a snug fit, but for the SD1000 camera, it has some extra space, especially near the top where the strap goes through which isn't quite what I was looking for. Unlike other reviews, the strap does go through the the provided hole fully, without cutting it to make it bigger which is nice. It is too big to carry in your pocket comfortably and does not hold anything extra, unless you don't have your extra memory card in a plastic case, and then it fits fine. The magnet holds well, and doesn't make a loud noise when you close it."
2,not for a canon s95,"waaaay to small for a canon s95, had to return it. just got a much cheaper case logic and it fits the camera and has a little pocket in front for a fraction of the cost"
4,"Nice, but doesn't fit Canon SD-770is","This case fits my Canon SD-1000, but for my SD-770is, it's a bit too small. The leather front/back is quite stiff. Not my favorite camera case. I prefer the Canon black leather cases because they're softer and wear well."
5,Gets the job done,"There's not much to say, other than this case gets the job done. I had a minor misgiving when I first put my camera in it. The magnet didn't seem to be strong enough to hold the flap closed. But after a little breaking in, the leather got more flexible and now after a month the flap stays closed fine. I bought the PSC-1000 camera because of it's diminutive size, and thus I didn't want a case that would add a lot of extra bulk. This case fits the bill nicely."
3,Average,It fits the camera well but I think I'd rather have a case where I can take pictures without removing the case since it's less likely to get dropped when I'm not using it anyway.
4,Functional and compact,This is a good case that serves its purpose. The only minor annoyance is that the opening at the top for the cord isn't wide enough for the latch on the camera. You really have to shove it through. But I'd buy it again!
5,perfect case,"I like this camera case. It protects well and my camera fits easily. The strap hole is a little difficult to fit, but is easy to keep the camera safely in the case without threaded through."
2,Magnetic Closure Issue?,"I like this case, it's really nice and sleek. The only issue I have, well outside of the fact that the strap is difficult to push through the small opening, the magnetic closure seems to be missing, the closure looks like a screw and there's a magnet inside of the case. But I've only had it for a few hours and it looks like the magnetic base is creating a hole in the fabric of the case because of the screw which binds it.Is anyone else having this problem, or is this just a defective case?"
4,Well Made Basic Protection,"This case provides reasonable protection and adds minimal bulk to the tiny SD1000 camera. This also means that it holds just the camera and nothing else. Any accessories have to go somewhere else. The belt loop offers an additional carrying option, but because it is a simple fixed loop, adding/removing the case from ones belt requires partial unbelting. The magnetic clasp holds the flap securely, but because the bottom of the flap is flush with the bottom of the case, opening the case can involve some fumbling to get a hold of the flap."
3,stylish and compact but poor quality shows,"the case is small and stylish and perfectly sized to fit just the camera, which is exactly what I wanted. however, the stitching on the interior looked cheap. and then within a week or two of carrying it around in my purse, the silver coating on the little Canon emblem flaked right off, leaving little bits of metallic paint(?) all over the interior. the only deluxe thing about this is the price."
5,Nice and soft,"I bought these for my son when he was 5 months and he is still wearing them at 12 months. Only cons are that after a couple of washes, they look faded and they do not have any non-skid gripping on the bottom."
1,THIS IS A JOKE. DO NOT PURCHASE,"My daughter told me that she wanted an all orange kitchen. So, I found this bowl. Nowhere does it give material or dimensions, but it looks like a well-made good-sized mixing bowl...IT IS NOT. IT IS A CHEAP PIECE OF BENDABLE/CRUSHABLE PLASTIC that measures 6"" at the top/widest. AND IT COST NEARLY $4.00. I could pick up a package of 4 at the 99 Cent Only Store for, say...a BUCK! WHAT A JOKE. And it's hardly worth returning since it would cost about that much...Now, I am terribly embarrassed to give this as a gift."
4,Good holster,"I was hoping that maybe this sat a little farther down than my Blackhawk, but it doesn't. However, this is a perfect size for a Walther PK .380, which is a size harder to fine. The tension can be adjusted to make the draw more to your personal. Well built. Easy on/off paddle can either fit belt through or over top of waste band and down."
4,good snack,Great snack to keep around the house and avoid all the jumk food. Taste good and keeps well. Zip lock on packaging helps keep it fresh.
2,short-lived,"I've purchased numerous of these timers. They performed very well for one full season. This season, however, most (but not all) of them are either completely dead or the LCD display is malfunctioning or not responding to button pushes (yes, this is with fresh batteries installed). Speaking of batteries... the battery compartment lacks a proper seal to keep moisture out, which is a glaring oversight by the manufacturer. The angle of the design can be a bit awkward depending on the angle of the hose bib to which you connect the timer -- and can also create more vulnerability for the seal-less battery compartment should a connection leak. The ability to adjust the angle and a sealed compartment would be great improvements. And, of course, these little timers are way too expensive to last only one season."
2,"Interesting story, but mainly for sailors","I found the story of the round-the-world race fascinating, but had trouble getting past all the sailing terms. I am not a sailor, but imagine if you were this would be a very good book. I did enjoy the backgrounds of the sailors and why they would want to endure such an ordeal."
3,Too much explanation - too little story,"Lundy constantly interrupts a gripping narrative with dry explanations. Some of the explanation is justified, like the construction of Vendee Globe racers, and some is interesting, like the history of circumnavigation, but it was a mistake to disrupt the story, which becomes hard to follow.If you are looking for another real-life adventure like Into Thin Air and hope to vicariously battle the South Seas from the safety and comfort of your armchair, it would be best to look elsewhere."
4,Good book if you're into sailing.,If you like sailing get the book. The things they do are truly amazing.
2,why does it have to vibrate?,"what is the point of makeing a toy that vibrates when it strikes something? its already going to vibrate on its own because it hit something. the previous sound effects lightsabers took two D batteries. this one used three AA's which saves space, which was filled with a motor to make it vibrate. if you took out the motor and moved the lamp down right next to the speaker it would only take up about 1/3 of the hilt. you could then shorten the blade about 2 inches and make a lightsaber with a %100 retractable blade. great amount of detail though for a $20 childrens toy."
5,Freedom to choose the food we eat.,"Farmageddon is an excellent movie showing the struggle family farmers are having to keep their ability to grow and produce organic and sustainaly raised products for us. Big Agriculture would like nothing more than to put the competition out of business which will leave us with only chemically treated, Genetically Modified unlabeled foods and animals raised in confinement and filth eating inappropriate diets. This movie shows how they are putting family farmers out of business destroying an American way of life as we have known it.For all of that is very well done and shows how wonderful and beautiful family farms are and our need to be aware and to speak up and out to protect our American Family Farm Heritage."
5,THANKYOU KRISTIN!,"and to all those who worked to make this documentary available to the public. Everytime I watch a film like this, along with Food Inc., King Corn, World accrd.to Monsanto, etc....I get ill. Amazes me how this is America and how far we have come. Sad...very sad. Great documentary."
2,Good in its time - Brad please update,"I'm a tennis coach and much of the advice is outdated. Brad needs to revise the book for the modern game. Love Brad. One of the best minds in the game. Brad, please update and republish!"
5,Advice that you can apply right away,I am a 4.0 player. This is the most applicable tennis book I have read. Once I started I could not put it down. That same week I was able to use several tips from the book. There were many points that I won thanks to the adjustments I made based on Gilbert's advice. A must-have for the intermediate player.
4,Winning Ugly.,"Great book. Lots of useful tips to make your tennis game better. Entertaining as well, since the book is peppered with personal anecdotes to illustrate his point. The only thing is that I was not following tennis during his professional career, so I only know the players of his era superficially."
3,Difficult to review,"I'm a fan of Patrick Barlow, and I purchased this VHS to complete my collection of Barlow's work. As a woman of 40, I actually do like animated films - such as the Toy Stories, earlier classic Disneys, and so on, and from that I wasn't impressed with the animation of this movie. The plot itself was okay. The voicework was fine."
3,Equivalent Camcorder Batter,"I purchased the battery for a camcorder because of the price. I have only used this camcorder one time after recieving this battery. To date I have no complaints. It seems to discharge faster than the OME battery but I expected this. All in All, it is to soon to say."
1,"Used, Defective, or Poor Quality","I ordered three Sony M Type NP-FM50-equivalent camcorder battery packs from eForcity. The package arrived quickly, but the batteries charge only to 105 to 117 minutes. They should charge to at least 200 minutes (Sony packs charge to more than 300 minutes!). I used three different chargers and three different camcorders. At less than two hours of use, these batteries are pretty much useless. Even my oldest Sony packs have more charge time than these. These must be either used, defective, or just poor quality. I applied for a return authorization, but never received a response from eForcity."
4,"Beyond lyrical science, the art of honest contemporary history of science","At first, it starts like a paper in National Geographic, then your interest is growing and after page 100, you may not stop reading it.Beyond the chronological order, the chapters appear in a well structured progression reviewing the different domains involved the the snowball theory: geology, climatology, sedimentology, biology,..Almost as exciting as J. Watson's ""The double Helix"" this book is much more honest too. The author shows the role of the personalities, their conflicts and the difficulties to built a new large theory. It also shows how geology differs from other hard experimental sciences, because they deal with a single long historic process: the story of Earth.Eventually, geologists' lives are far more interesting and sometimes adventurous compared to the common university folk."
2,shipping beta code?,I hit two nasty bugs quickly after installing and using this software: 1) the upgrade from a previous version (which was working fine) resulted in a machine that did not boot. 2) an attempt to resize a Linux partition failed for lack of memory on a machine that had almost 400MB of memory.I don't think this release was tested very well!
5,Colson does it again with Intellect and the Knife of Reason,"Colson addresses common questions teens ask about God, science, morality and other wolrdview issues. Colson answers them clearly and accurately, using the latest sources and relevant examples. A must for youth leaders and parents. Even if you don't have kids, this will help you with your own questions which are probably the same. Colson, along with others like Phillip Johnson and Hugh Ross are leading Christianity back to its position of intellectual leadership by so clearly showing the fallicies underlying the bankrupt religions of materialism, modernism and naturalism."
3,Mildly Interesting,"Le Colonial is a mildly interesting, slight tale set in the 1770's in France and Vietnam, at the beginning of French colonization of what was then known as Annam. But, as an historical novel, it fails to give the reader a visceral sense of the country or the times. It is lacking in historical detail and relies, instead, on the broad picture, which, while somewhat informative, is no more than one could gain from reading a short encyclopedia article on the subject. This book easily can be skipped."
5,Great fan!,"I did a lot of research before buying this fan to find the best quiet PC case fans. I'm using this fan for my rear case exhaust in myAntec Nine Hundred Steel ATX Ultimate Gamer PC Case (Black). Much quieter than the stock 3-speed fans, and being controlled by my motherboard it doesn't always have to be running full blast.I went with 2AeroCool Turbine 2000 - Case fan - 120 mm - titaniumin the front of my case because they are slightly quieter, and light-up."
3,"Sturdy, but problematic","I was excited to get this set since the reviews all raved about it. After the first use of the 8 qt. pot, I was dismayed that there was a 'chip' or discoloration on the bottom. I phoned Farberware and explained to the service rep that to exchange all pots would be exhorbitant mailing fees. She said she would send me another one. Sure enough, I did receive another one which works well. However, a couple more pots have tiny discolorations on the inside bottom that looks like they are defective as well. My Revereware had no such marks on the inside even after 25 yrs. Needless to say, I am disappointed...."
3,"Overall a good set for the price, but...","I bought this cookware set almost a year ago and since then, I have been using it to cook almost three times a week. It's OK for the price, but not perfect. The cooking sheet and cake pan are almost useless in my opinion. They seemed fake from first glance, and, indeed, they did not last long, having being discolored quickly. They would not distribute heat very well too, unlike other pans I've used. The saucepots and saucepans are of better, heavy construction; they seem to endure usage so far. My only complaint is that the lids of the saucepots get very hot after a while, so you will need gloves to handle them. The skillets and bowls are very good, and I did not encounter any problem with them.All in all, I would probably buy again if I needed a cookware set, but I don't know whether I'll buy Farberware next time I look for a single piece."
2,Love but uncomforatable,"These boots are super cute! They are a true navy and look great with skinny jeans either faded or darker blue, they make my legs look like they go on forever! They feel like the arch (there is no arch) goes all the way across my foot so it feels like it's being forced into an upside down V. I keep trying them on hoping they get more comfortable. I normally wear a 10 and the length is correct, but I have a narrow foot so my foot slides a bit in thinner socks. Thick socks were too thick, I'll try medium thickness socks next and see if that works, otherwise they must be sadly returned.:-("
5,This Book Saved My Ass,"(Opps, can I use that word here ?). This is the only book you need for a beginner's to itermediate course. I have a degree in Mathematics plus C and VB programming background plus tones of work experience, but was devestated with ""Distributed Computing"" (UNIX) tutors, who simply forgot to do a ""Train the Trainer"" course before accepting the job offer! Anyway, this excellant book has the following strengh: (1) Covering almost all topics even the more obsure unix usage like XARG stuff (2) Appropriate lay-out for easy study & referene (3) concise but just enough details of explanation with PRECISION, so it takes guess work out of your study. I have been buying books from Amazon for years, but this is the first review I wrote, 'cause I owe it to the author !! Hay sumitabha, are you gonna write any other books on C++, c#.net, VB.net, or Java ?"
1,"very hard, uncomfortable to wear, not recommended",The shoes are very cute and very well priced but uncomfortable to wear it for more than one hour.
2,Not comfortable,these shoes are so cute but not comfortable. they are also too low for me. I gave them to my daughter who hasn't worm them yet.
2,Okay working shoes,"I was expecting cute flats for everyday wear. But to be quite honest these aren't that cute.. more leaning towards granny looking shoes. The shoe is also VERY hard. Not quite sure about the comfort level yet since I haven't worn it outside, but I doubt it will be super comfortable. I don't really like the heel of the shoe either. I will wear these for work.."
5,you like this cd. you gotta love this cd. you know you nead,"this is dc tlak at there best. i enjoyed there pervous albums. i am glad they turned form rap to altinitve. it has the rock sonds i like combined with words that bring glory to the kingdom of God. it nice to listen to music that entertranes and ministirs at the same time. my all time fevoits are waht i stumble and in the light. i also ike cholered pople,just betren you and me(the theme of forgivenes is relly sated in way that meks a lto of sence.like love it nead it. if want the type of of this era that wil setle your soil, thi si what your loking for"
5,"I call this a ""Wake up and see Jesus"" album","DC Talk puts lots of really differant but really good styles together with one great message. My favorite song off of this album are ""Coloured People"" ""What if I Stumble"" and ""Jesus Freak"" If you want to be moved by music than this is a CD for you."
3,Monster's Ball - A Quick Review,A timely depiction of the effects of racism and how personal events changed the attitude of one individual. Very well acted by all the cast.
3,Don't get the Kindle version,"Although the book itself deserves 4 stars, I am not happy because I purchased the Kindle version, which still states there is a CD with it. I expected a code of some sort or instructions on where to download the music. There are instructions forgetting the generator, but from what I can tell that isn't everything."
5,From tha author of Tales of Ancient Xenar,"I just bought this book. I haven't fully read it yet. But the reason I am giving it 5 stars is because of the extreme amount of content. Its over 480 pages long and it tells you how to achieve astral projection within a span of 90 days, which is 60 days longer than in the book Have an Out of Body Experience in 30 days. But of that book and Beginner's Guide to Astral Projection, this one is definitely the most detailed I have seen. So the 5 stars is for the amount of detail in this book."
3,Cool toy for the Bookworm,"Very cheaply made from China, but this item is still super cool for the price. Push button action, it opens up like a robot with mechanical movement. We enjoy it!!"
4,Are You Ready For Your Interview?,"When the interviewer asks ""Do you have any questions,"" the worse answer you could possibly give is ""no - no questions."" Not asking questions shows that you are uninterested in either the job or company. If you've done what you should - which is research the company; you should always have questions to ask. If you're not sure what to ask, 101 Smart Questions to ask on Your interview will get you started in the right direction.As the book says ""a little knowledge is powerful"" and this book will help you to get there. The book provides an excellent list of job search sites to assist even a ""novice"" job seeker (including sites for recent college grads).During the interview is not the only time you should be asking questions, however, the book also provides a list of questions to ask yourself after the interview and your new boss once you're hired.The end of the book provides an Appendix which includes possible responses to the 20 most difficult interview questions."
4,An excellent read!,"This book is about Joshua T. Bates who spent all summer having fun...that is until Labor Day when his mom gave him the devastating news ---he had to repeat third grade !He thought his year would be terrible and that everyone would make fun of him because he flunked third grade.But his teacher cared and gave him the extra help he needed to succeed. Joshua made new friends and learned that with hard work and and practice he could make it into fourth grade where he belonged.Kids our age will like this book because it is a page turner and it teaches you that no matter how bad things may seem, if you believe in yourself, you can do anything!"
2,Not the tea pot that is shown here!!,"First of all, I was hesitant to order this teapot because there was one review that said there were no dragonflies on it. I thought maybe that was just a mistake on the sellers part, and the customer was sent the wrong teapot. BUT, the same thing happened to me. I received a teapot that does not have a dragonfly OR an insect on it. What a disappointment. This was going to be a gift for someone who LOVES dragonflies and insects. I will keep the pot and use it but I am not happy. SECOND, this teapot came totally fallen out of the box it was in. It was sent with another set it a larger box, and it was not even sitting in its own box. It was on the bottom of the carton. Surprised it was not broken. I just received this today, and went to write this review, and also see it came down in price by ten dollars. Too bad I did not get it for less, especially since it was not what I ordered!"
4,Just started taking,"So far so good!! Large capsules, can't say much because I just started taking them. The safety seal was on & delivered quick"
3,Magazine more than book,"The content is interesting, just don't love the cover. It is magazine quality...even in print. I fear it will be easily worn."
2,Not sure how accurate this is,"I had my cholesterol tested at an urgent care facility and it was 213. Four days later, I tested my cholesterol with the Cholestrak and it was around 157 (somewhat difficult to determine if it was 157 or 161 or even possibly 164). I did change my diet drastically for the last 4 days, but I highly doubt it made this much of a difference in only 4 days. If it did, I would be really happy! I'll know how much my cholesterol really changed in a month when I go back to have it checked at the urgent care facility again."
2,TEST,"THIS PRODUCT WAS NOT WHAT I WANTED, I WANTED TOHAVE THE ABILIBTY TO PERFORM MULTIPLE CHOLESTEROL SCREENING ON INDIVIDUALS IN A COMMUNITY HEALTH FAIR.I ARRIVED NEW"
1,NYT large print easy crossword puzzles,These puzzles are NOT easy. I gave this book to my elderly mother in a nursing home to help pass the time and she cannot even start most of the puzzles.It was a waste of money to buy this book.
1,beter to get a rated R movie if you want nudity,"if your interest is to see her in the nude, it's better just to get yourself a rated R movie. That'll give you a plot for your money. This video only shows her personal life artisticaly. if you like the talk then this is it. if you like the nudity then look elsewhere."
5,Marvelous!!,"I read this book as part of Reader's Digest Today's Best and it was just an amazing story of courage, love, and self-determination. I encourage anyone to go and get this book ASAP. It is an wonderful account of the live of Robert Pensack and how he was able to deal with his illness and become a successful doctor. Remarkable reading."
1,boo-hiss,"Don't be fooled - while this sounds like a 'full scale' novel? It's only 80 pages.... and to top that off? the embedded retail price on the book is 2.99 I paid twice that. I thought I was going to be getting a 'real' book... instead I got a short story. I must say - I'm very disappointed. BTW, I only gave it one star because it wouldn't allow me to enter the review without @ least one. :O("
2,A empty story that is not worth the price.,"I'm not sure this tiny tiny book deserves a review, but here goes. I bought this book,(which should be sold with bold letters as a Short Story) with a view towards introducing myself to Nora Roberts. Well, I guess I should have read the reviews closer because after I paid the cost of shipping and the price for this 80 page loosely written story I was without a doubt disappointed. I'm amazed that this best selling author is cranking out these empty books. Oh well, I tried Nora, and I'm not sure if I'll buy another book by this author. If I do I'll check it out at my library"
2,Not one of her best,"Nora Roberts has so many wonderful books, unfortuantely this is not one of them. The concept is ok, but since it is such a short story the character development is really lacking. A quick, easy read with little enjoyment."
2,Not her best,"I usually enjoy Nora Roberts, but these short story books certainly aren't her best. If you're new to her, I'd suggest reading one of her novels. If you're simply jonesing for a Roberts fix, I suppose this will tide you over."
1,Amazon rips off customers,"Amazon sells this item for 2.99 plus shipping, the price, which is marked quite clearly on the front cover of the book is $2.50..............seems to me someone is padding their pockets as we all know that Amazon did not pay even 2.50 for these books."
5,This is a great book to read!,This book will keep you on the edge of your seat and not let you put it down. I love novels like this. I would recommend this to anyone who would like a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I would also recommend a lot of her other books!!
2,Too short,It started of good but about the time all the characters were developing the book was over. A lesson for me to check the number of pages in a book before purchasing.
3,Far fetched,I enjoy most if Nora's work and this book was no exception. But only 3 stars because the subject matter was truly unbelievable
5,"Review by a ""real"" sister!","Being a ""real"" sister for over 40 years myself, I have followed this series with great interest and enjoyment....Lee treats sisters with respect and insights into our foibles....As usual, Lee keeps us guessing as to the twists and turns that her stories never fail to bring to the reader.....This one is especially good in keeping the identity of the murderer until the end...I must admit.. for those last few pages I couldn't wait and took the book to prayers with me...Thanks, Lee for a fun read...If you ever need a consultant on ""nuns"" just call me...."
3,Where's the rest of me?,"This is great material and a good price. I was hoping to use this collection to replace the VHS recordings I made off the History Channel in the mid-1990's. Unfortunately, this set ""only"" contains 8 episodes, and the series ""Civil War Journal"" had more than 40 episodes. I'm wondering where the other episodes are and why I can't seem to find a complete set. If you locate one (on DVD), let me know.That being said, this set is nicely packaged and comes as advertised. The price was right; I had just hoped that perhaps there would be some ""extra"" episodes buried in there somewhere. Hopefully the other episodes will show up somewhere."
4,very comfortable,"great fit for my size 13 dogs, and they look pretty cool. the stitching is slightly dorky, but it does add a little texture. that's the only reason it doesn't get a 5 out of 5. we'll see how they perform on the court."
1,Poor Product,"My first 204000 pump died after 30 days of operation. The second, covered under warranty, lasted 7 months but now has seized and died. Not sure I am staying with this manufacturer for the replacement."
4,Truth Stranger than Life,"""Truth is really stranger than fiction. While Phil Spector's murder trial continues in real life (with the TV movie sure to come), you can read the true life story of a rock n'roll legend who is now on trial for his life."
4,keep in mind the paper is thin,This is a great item but paper is slippery and almost translucent. Will need to color with colored pencils. Go this for my daugher who loves to do detail coloring.
5,A first-rate history of a beautiful place,"The typical visitor to St. Simons Island heads straight to the beach. But the vacationer's stay would be greatly enhanced by a quick detour to the local bookstore to buy a copy of this excellent book, which makes for easy beach reading. Mr. Green has made history come alive by highlighting the lifestyle of the island's pre-Civil War residents and by portraying its surprising significance to John Wesley, founder of the Methodist Church. Mary Green's illustrations enrich the text by portraying both the beauty of the island and the strength of character of its early residents. The net result of the ""Green team's"" efforts make those who come to the island realize that it is more than just a pretty place"
5,A great read and very informative,"I truly enjoyed this book. Not only is it chock full of valuable information, but it was also a truly entertaining read. Def. a must read for the serious collector and the serious bookseller."
4,good book,I would recommend the purchase of this book. Good information to help you evaluate what you have in your collection or what you have purchased for resale.
3,not their best by far,this may be my least favorite demented disc ive heard. not that many great songs on it like there are on their other discs
3,More daring needed,"Some really curvy, sexy girls in this one, but there simply is enough being done with the available material. When you've got babes with a pair like Kimber West (I could spend all day with those breasts in my hands), hips like the delightful Jennifer Miriam, what is Playboy doing with all that rapid editing and unneccessary costumes on the girls? They shoud leave the rock videos to MTV, and concentrate on delivering the goods that Playboy's in the business of supplying: fast, beautiful women dancing around naked, with lots of long lingering close-ups of their bodies in action."
3,3 1/2 really,"Years later after enjoying Kelly Monaco on Dancing with the Stars, she is my favorite reason for owning this. Back then my favorite reason was Ulrika Ericsson. Two hot babes.Jennifer Allen, Carrie Stevens, & Victoria Silvstedt would round out my top picks for an overall good year."
4,HIC Blue Willow Teapot,I was very pleased when I open the box and saw the teapot. Blue Willow has always been a favorite of the daughter-in-law who will be getting it as a christmas present. I think she will be very satisfied.
3,not happy with shippiong,"it arrived on time but infuser was broken on arival , did not choose to return item , but disposed of infuser . other wise i love it"
3,It is good despite of the frequent need of cleaning,"When I first saw it, I was surprised by its size. But then I thought, whatever, it fit my kind of lazy people because I could make a large tank of tea. However, I found a lot of stain on the infuser and the internal face of the teapot after I used it for a whole day. Moreover, those stain could not be got rid of just by rinsing. I had to use my hand to wipe the stain."
4,A nice and brief social commentary,"I'm a big fan of other Sicilian novels, especially Lampedusa's the Leopard and Riotta's Prince of the Clouds. The island's tragic history produces a rich backdrop for painting a nuanced set of characters and emotions.Sciascia's short novel is wholly Sicilian, centering around his anti-mafia frustrations. The characters are nicely sketched and the writing is brief and exciting. It's a short book that reads quickly and lively.I appreciated the story and its quick moving plot. It's a good book and the introduction is helpful for understanding it's context. At the end of the day, the work is more commentary on Sciascia's times than it is a complex wrought novel. I'm glad I read it, but I didn't find it as fulfilling as I thought I might. Look to the Leopard or the Prince of Clouds if you're looking for a full fledged novel. Otherwise, you'll be very pleased with this nice work."
5,So far so good,"I'm not a car specialist of any kind, I'm mostly on consuming side of process, but people, who installed this item were quite impressed. Time will show how long will it last."
2,it's looks nice on the outside..,"i bought it this christmas as a gift for a close friend..she liked it very much coz it really looks nice but in less than a month, this friend emailed me saying that she needs to buy a new battery for the watch i gave her bec it bogged down, which embarrases me coz she was using it for like less than 3 weeks!now she thought it might be the batteries..we don't know yet the cause of it bogging down but i'm thinking of returning it so it can be replaced..maybe you guys could check first little details like those so as not to have customers be discouraged of purchasing from you again."
3,it's ok...,"though this isn't really a horror movie, it's got a whole lot of references to 'em. & it kinda openned the doorway for today's horror movies like ""i know what you did..."". so if you're gonna watch this hoping it'll be scary, you're wasting you're time. it's amusing, but definitely not that funny. real horror fans may find the excessive dialogue tedious. i'm sure it would have been better if wes craven wrote the story too. this exact review can also be used for ""scream 2"" :o)"
4,SCARIEST HORROR FILM IN MANY YEARS,"Every now and again a genuinley frightening horror film hits the big screens. This is most defintley one of those films!! The opening sequence with Drew Barrymore is bound to keep you on the edge of your seat through what seems an excruiating wait. The film holds many shocking and jumpy moments but some sequences fall flat with it coming across more like a comic horror film rather than being played for thrills. The scripts career along at a hectic and melodramatic pace and the cast are all quite capable although the so called teenage actors look like a lot older than what they were intended to be in the film. On the whole its a very good, dark and often frightening horror film. Recommended."
1,SCREAM WILL MAKE YOU WANT YOUR MONEY BACK,"SCREAM with NEVE CAMPBELL, DREW BARRYMORE and COURTNEY COX was a totally awful movie. There's a really lame plot to it all I mean you pretty much figure out who the killer's are early on, also there is too much emphysis on gory effects too which in my opinion was totally unecessary as well. My advice is too skip this movie and see Halloween instead which in my opnion was a horror classic."
5,This movie is the BOMB!!,"Scream is a really scary movie with a lot of blood, which is a real horror movie. The plot was very smart. Wes Craven has done an excellent job on this movie. So scary. I can't believe that Drew Barrymore was one of the main stars of this movie, even though she was on for 10 minutes. I liked the telephone calls the killer makes. The beginning scene was the best with Drew Barrymore. One to Watch!! Take my advice, it'll scare you."
1,How is this scary?,"Nothing is scary about it. Nothing. I was by myself in the dark laughing hysterically at it. There was not a single moment where this movie was trying to be scary. This was intended as comedy, pure and simple!"
5,The scariest movie ever made!,"I remember seeing this movie in its opening weekend just because my friends wanted to see it. I was completely unprepared for how terrifying it is. I was too afraid to be home alone for a while - and even answering the phone with people around made me nervous! It's clever and amusing, and keeps you guessing (and on the edge of your seat) right up to the end. This one is definitely the best of the series (Scream 2 being the worst). Don't see it unless you want to be scared."
4,One point off because it was unrealistic - EVERYONE died!,"Scream, the title describes exactly what you do when you see this film, it's scary and exciting. It's a real thriller and certainly a chiller. Courtney Cox plays her role brilliantly as does the rest of the cast, the director did a brilliant job too. Well worth seeing!"
5,Absolutely Brilliant,"THIS MOVIE IS THE BOMB!!!! i am only 12 and I didn't think it was that scary, if you like horror films, this is a must see!!!"
5,Scream,"Scream is the best scary movie I've ever seen.My favorite part of the whole movie was of course the opening seen.I mean, Drew Barrymore did areally good job in the scene.It was about 12 minutes of her and the killerplaying cat and mouse, it was really cool.And I also like the ending because it's where they have the two killers and Sidney.And it just ended in a real bloodbath.So seriously, watch this movie"
2,At least it kept you wondering who the killer was,"Ok, first of all, it wasn't scary enough to make it a classic horror movie, but did create some moments of anxiety. The main reason I didn't like it was due to the pathetic attempt at humor. The scene where he says his mom is going to kill him because he has been murdering people is not funny! I thought the actors did a good job, but the writing was not to be applauded. Humor needs to be more witty, less pathetic. Horrow alone though, the movie could be given a 4."
4,Good Movie:Good DVD,Well I Liked This Scream The Best Out Of The 3 I Dont Think Its As Good As Some People Lead You To Believe But ITs Worth Owning I Think The Plot Is The Main Charater Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell)And HEr Best Friend Tatum (Rose Mcgowan) Her Boyfriend Billy (skeet Urlich) His Best Friend Stu (Matthew Lillard)The OBsessed Scary movie Fan Randy (jamie kennedy) could All Be The Killer But She Must Find Out before He/Or She Kills Everyone of her friends And her.All The People In The Movie Give Great Proformeces My Favorite Being courtney Cox As The Cocky Bitch reporter Gail Weathers And Jamie Kennedy's Proforece Of The Scary movie Loving Randy Well In My Opion Its Worth Just Watching The last 20 Minutes Which Is Very Suspenseful.So I Would Rent First but If Your A Big Horror Buff Buy IT Youll Like It
4,Scream,"This is the best scary movie I had seen in a long while...It had alot of blood, screaming, and a big mystery..It kept me guessin all the way to the end..."
3,Scream (1996),"I don't know whether it was because I had heard so much good stuff about this or what, but it turned out rather disappointing. The film is very well acted, shot and often scary. However I thought the plot just went downhill after the opening sequence. The ending didn't satisfy me and in my opinion, it was a tad humorous but I felt it had a demented and crude side to it. The ghost-face villain was sometimes creepy, but had no atmospheric movements like other killers in other similar films did. I thought the film was pretty good, especially the opening sequence with Drew Barrymore, but the film went downhill quite a bit. I just think it got a little too many they-like-it-so-i-will-like-it reviews which made me a little disappointed. Otherwise, pretty good."
2,scream is nothing to scream about,"scream is little more than a joke with 25 year old actors playing teenagers. it is totally unoriginal and it is a retread of the Friday the 13th Nightmare on Elm Street format. Any horror film that goes out of it's way to cater to teenagers whether it be in the 1950s such as I Was A Teenage Werewolf or in the 1990's such as Scream or I Know What you Did Last Summer is never a serious or truly scary and disturbing horror film> It boggles my mind why anyone would consider this mediocre lame filnm to be scary or a classic. Films such as the original Psycho. the Exorcist, Sisters, the original cat people or the Blair Witch project are true horror films which get into your psyche and truly shock and scare. Forget this silly teen oriented product. This is mere teeny bopper stuff like the Backstreet Boys,"
2,A little lame and over done.,"I don't what they were trying to get at with this movie, i guess putting Drew Barrymore in the movie was trying to grab a certain audiance. All I gotta say is she was dead in like the first 20 minutes which doesn't seem like she was really a main character at all. The only reason I would have wanted to see the secound one was because she was in it, but, OPPS! shes dead before it starts. The plot was see through and the leads of ""who done it"" were really obvisious. You had to know that it was more then one person because everyone else was placed somewher else. I think this move was made with the money in mind, not real horror. 2 and 3 are just an insult to your intelligents."
5,A fan of the classics loves a slasher-Story at 8,"I love scary movies. Really. But, I'm into the classics, like Frankenstein ('31) and Psycho ('60), so I was totally blown away by the fact that I actually enjoyed Scream! As a rule, I dislike slasher pics, but Scream is the wittiest and most original I have seen ever. It comes highly recommended!!"
5,This was the scary movie of the 90's!!!,"If you watch horror movies from the 70's and 80's, like ""Carrie"", ""The Amityville Horror"" or ""Prom Night"", they still will scare you. But you could not make a horror movie like that nowadays with the same effect. Until Wes Craven, created the new type of horror movies. He started it in the 70's with ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" and did it again with ""Scream"". ""Scream"" has become one the most original and most scariest movie to date. An all star cast, led by talented Neve Cambell, made this thriller a definate must see and is the beginning of future classic horror movies."
2,A SO-SO HORROR FLICK IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT SCREAM,I saw SCREAM and I expected to be scared out of my seat when I saw the previews but when I finally did see it I was dissappointed and here's why. I found that NEVE CAMPBELL was a little shallow in her role who she plays I'm not giving away just watch and see what I mean. I felt she didn't compare to JAMIE LEE CURTIS in HALLOWEEN or SISSY SPACEK in CARRIE now they did a great job with thier roles which I felt NEVE often didn't she seemed to me almost bored and it showed in her performance. Also the supporting cast left something to be desired too. They seemed to me to be too plastic and dull espically COURTNEY COX and DAVID ARQUETTE they did'nt make want to rally behind them at all. Also I felt you saw who the killer was too early in the film and that in my opnion took a lot away from the suspense that this film could've had. So all in all I wish I could recommend SCREAM but I find I can not.
1,TIM ADDAMS IS AN ...!!,"This movie ... as a horror film. Better viewed as a comedy. I watched this one alone in the dark and laughed my head off. Even my sister ... got scared in Jack-O thought this film was hilarious and she also watched it alone. If you're looking for good horror see Halloween or The Exorcist, or even Friday the 13th, but if you want a laugh out loud side bursting comedy, see Scream. I garantee you'll be laughing and NEVER SCREAMING during this comedy."
2,Suspicion on author's true motives,"The book was not the best read ever, but the thing that bothered me the most was the building tide of suspicion that I experienced the further I read.I did not know Madalyn, but I find it hard to believe that anyone quite as constantly nasty as Seaman makes her out to be could have accomplished anything. Granted, I believe Madalyn was a complicated and sometimes difficult woman, but it seemed that Seaman could not find one single attribute to praise in the woman. I found myself researching the author to see if I could find her religious affiliations. Other than the book being sold in a christain bookstore, I could not conclude anything, but I suspect that Seaman did not have any charitable feelings toward O'Hair or atheists in general from the outset."
2,"Classic Album, Sounds Terrible","I love this record but the mastering is awful, very muddy and soft, and I'm far from being an audiophile. To me, the yellow greatest hits CD sounds a lot brighter and is what I'll continue listening to for my Trammps fix - even if most of the songs were shortened for that CD."
2,A Head Scratcher?,"I would gladly give this 5 stars if it wasn't for several songs being shortened for this cd. Soul Searchin' time plays 3:20. My vinyl plays 6:03. And Hooked For Life plays 2:59, my vinly plays 4:42. And both songs are listed on this cd as lp version. 991/2 plays 3:36 and mines plays 5:07. Proceed with caution."
5,Christian Studies,"This book is very, very helpful along with the video for people who want to learn how to pray. A good teaching tool."
5,Easy to use,"I have sewn for years on a regular machine, but have always been hesitant to buy a serger because of the cost, and because I have seen how hard they are to thread correctly. However, this one caught my attention because the reviews said it was easy to use, & because of the low price, I was willing to take a chance. The reviews are accurate. It comes already threaded, so you can start sewing right away. After I read the instruction book and watched the handy CDs, I was able to make two pairs of pants immediately, and was able to thread the machine correctly on my first try, with only a bit of puzzling about the loopers. It's really quite simple and fast, a pleasant surprise. The accessory bag did not have a screwdriver, but the instruction book said that it was included. I would recommend this for anyone learning how to serge."
5,Brothers serger 1034D,Brothers is a fine machine. My wife had a little trouble threading the machine at first but we went to the instructions and it was easy to thread. It was our fault not the machine. She says she would reconmend it highly to anyone. She is happy with her machine. Thanks
4,Brothers 1034D,"I purchased this serger in May and loved it. It worked for 2 weeks, then stopped.It was still under warranty and Brothers authorized it to be fixed.It was impossible to get the parts for the motor and Brothers refused to doanything other than to try to track down the part.It sat in the shop for 6 weeks and during that time the warranty ran out.After no satisfaction with Brothers, I called Amazon.They were wonderful!!! They replaced the machine completely without any chargesto me and I will ship the old machine back free as well.I can't say enough about how great Amazon is to work with.I will continue to be a faithful customer of theirs.Barb"
5,Wonderful at home serger.,"I have used this on many projects, and it works beautifully. Easy to thread, many stitch selections, and has many other things you can use it for besides serging."
1,Troublemaker,This is a little troublemaker!!!! It won't sew all kinds of fabric. It's incredibly tedious to thread and if you don't do it right the thread will break. Had mine in for service the first week. Save your money and get a Juki.
3,Still reviewing,"I havent really fully used this machine because I found a little bit intimidating. The cds are helpfull but I wish they had a more updated version. When you play the cds, the topics are not in order and I found the video a little boring. I still havent compltely used it and taking step by step. But it is a good machine for the money. I am sure I wil love it once I get the hang of it."
5,Brother 1034 Serger,"Great machine - easy to thread, easy to use. Have had mine about a month and have done many projects with it. Uses regular machine needles and regular thread. Would recommend this product.Brother 1034D 3/4 Lay-In Thread Serger"
1,Oh Brother!,"As far as Sergers go this one was the cheapest.I have worked with sergers and coverlock machines in school before, and wanted a more finished look for my projects. I figured this would be a good starter machine since it was offered under $200. It arrived quickly, and I tired to thread it by tying the new thread onto the existing pre threaded spools. It didn't work, and I had to rethread. That was not a big deal as this machine is color coded, and for the most part simple.Working on the first project this machine broke 3 needles, and I was sewing a very thin knit fabric. Thread on it breaks constantly, and the thread tensions are all over the place. I am very disappointed, and this may be the last Brother machine I buy, very unreliable."
4,Easy to use,"Just arrived, already threaded...very easy to use...good deal....liked the narrow roll hem feature, so much different from my old serger which I have to remove the plate n the foot, put on the roll hem plat n the roll hem foot, with ,this one, just one step n its done ."
1,Super Disappointed,"I took it out of the box and the hand wheel was stuck. Google ""Brother 1034D hand wheel stuck"" and you will see it is a common problem. I took it to the authorized service center in my area and the lady there said that this machine is a ""piece of crap"". She said that people bring them in regularly for some reason or another and that several times the owner just has to throw it out because nothing can be done.It will be weeks before mine is fixed or replaced. Luckily it was still under warranty, but too late to return to Amazon. Huge bummer, spend a little more money for a better machine."
2,Instructions are not good!!!,"If you are not an experienced sewing machine operator, prepare yourself to be frustrated. The video is somewhat useful but it rushes through the settings and the booklet is totatlly worthless. Besides...YOU WILL NEED A SEPARATE SEWING MACHINE for regular stitching, this one doesn't do any of the traditional stitches!!!"
5,Good does not try to confuse,"Old hand at networking (est 1994) and never bothered with any certifications. Book makes you think in exam mode rather than work\troubleshoot mode im used to.Passed both Inet+, and Network+ on first go Worked for me, and many others. Buy."
4,Recommended for those seeking understanding.,"The second in a series of the ""No-Eyes"" chronicles. Somewhat reminiscent of the Hobbit trilogy, except this is non-fiction. Probably not for the non-believers and skeptics as it will just be frustrating for them. Requires degree of metaphysics understanding to stay with the book."
5,Yea Passion Panties Fire Up,Fubuki is a normal girl with a fascinating hobbie showing off her panties while playing arcade games of course. Lol
1,central vacuum bags,"The product shipped to me was inferior. Despite the product code part number being displayed as an exact match to the part number I sought, the product shipped was different. The quality of the paper was thinner and the bags are half the volume of vacuum bags with the same part number I have purchased in the past. I pointed out the poor quality to the seller and they wrote me an email blaming the quality on their Asian supplier and offered to send me documentation for a refund but I never received the refund."
1,Another useless title,"There isn't anything new, innovative or interesting in this book. There are glaring errors bordering on misinformation throughout (don't get me started on the 'astrology' and backwards logic around it) and the actual magical sections are reproductions with the author's own attempts at poetry tacked on. The words 'magic' and 'spell' are over-used and the whole book has a feel of being thrown together.If I could vote this a zero I would."
3,I've really tried to like this.,"As a huge fan of Wilco, I really wanted to like this album. I played it nonstop for days and weeks, studied its lyrics, and tried to buy into Greg Kot's and Jeff Tweedy's praise of it and of Scott McCaughey, but no matter what I did I could never get very excited about it.I'm not a big fan of Scott McCaughey's voice, and the structure of his songs often seems operatic or Broadway-like. I think this album would have been much better if he'd let Wilco have an even bigger role than just his back-up band: the album's best song, I think, is ""Retrieval Of You"" which was co-written with Wilco's Jeff Tweedy, and I would have loved an entire album of that same sort. As it is, however, I just don't see the appeal...though I want to!"
4,Extremely good music this is....,"I just bought this CD a couple of days ago, and it has been in my stereo ever since. It takes some time to get used to the style of the music, but once you get over all the background effects and harmonized vocals, you will love it. You can definitely hear the influences that the members of Wilco had during the recording of this album (it reminds me of 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'), but it is most of all a completely original and mesmerizing album. The vocal styles are very reminiscent of some of the Beatles' releases from their middle years (Revolver, Abbey Road, etc.). All in all, it is a very good concept album, and it will not disappoint."
4,i never wanna lose those days of wine and booze,"To be honest,i don't know anything about minus 5,so i bought this album on the back of wilco's contribution. Wilco fans will love it, it has the poppy feel of summerteeth mixed with their 'new sound' of YHF. Jeff Tweedy only gets lead vocals on one track, 'the family gardiner' but it definitely feels like a wilco album.Plus you get the added bonus of scott mccaughey and co. taking up where pink floyd and the beatles left off. so the bottom line is,if you're a wilco fan buy it"
2,"do-wop-do-wop, oh no, yeah!","this album is the beatles put through the grunge grinder of disillusionment with 50s rock'n roll playing shoe-lah-lah do-wop-do-wop, in spite of the prospect of nuclear armagedon. In this melodic maligned maelstrom, musical molasses comes out on the other side with a cheery bitter sweet smile of trite lyrical contradictions, sluiced together with clich√©d tonescapes which pleasantly border on cacophony, leaving the listener with the pleasure of dissonance and yet the paul mccarteny feeling that everything is really going to be alright somehow, oh yeah..."
5,Greatest performance of perhaps the greatest symphony of all time,"To those in the know, Anton Bruckner's symphonies are among the very greatest, rivaled only by those of Beethoven, Mahler and Sibelius. And the 8th is in my opinion his greatest (he never completed his 9th, which maybe woud have taken 1st honors instead). Now, this recording is an ADD, made I think back in the late '60's but it is digitally remastered. There are better-sounding performances out there, but Bruckner demands the very apex of sensitivity and understanding of what he is trying to say, and Eugen Jochum has never been excelled in that dept. And directing the Berlin Phil., probably the finest orchestra in the world, doesn't hurt either.I know there are later recordings with him and a couple of other very fine orchestras. I haven't heard them. I'm sure the fidelity is better and the orchestras wholly capable. But I had this performance on an LP and I missed it terribly. I'm veery happy to have it on a CD, and so would you."
3,"A good grammar, not textbook","This is a pretty good grammar of the Mohawk language. It doesn't go into great detail, nor does it give many examples, but as a quick reference to Mohawk grammar, this book is pretty good. Although I would not recommend anyone use this book exclusively to learn Mohawk, it does make a good supplement to other texts. I would steer people interested in learning Mohawk to use 'Mohawk: A Teaching Grammar,' which is still available through the Kanien'keh√°:ka Onkwaw√©n:na Raotiti√≥hkwa Language and Culture Center (search google for it).Though I do recommend 'A Thousand Useful Words of Mohawk' by Maracle as a useful 'dictionary' for Mohawk.As far as the spelling system used in the two texts by Maracle, for the modern spelling system, use the 'phoentic spelling.' The 'phonetic spelling' used in the two books represents the way the language is actually written in parts of Canada and also represents how it is pronounced in a better fashion."
2,Always Remember the Source,"While the good Abbott does strive to be genuinely historical in his work, one has to wonder at the comment in the publisher's preface by Thomas Nelson. ""Apostasy from the Truth Faith always has dire consequences because one loses the special blessings and guidance from Almighty God."" The Catholics, of course, have labeled the Emperor Julian as an ""Apostate"" because he attempted to slow the rise of Christianity while trying to rekindle interest and devotion to a more polytheistic approach to religion. He also quotes, ""What if he had not lost The True Faith? How would history then have read?"" Why not ask What if he had lived and succeeded? Maybe there would have been no Christian Crusades, no Inquisition, etc.Really, if you want to more about Julian and his attempt to restore balance to the way people worshiped in the 4th Century, CE, try Gore Vidal's ""Julian"" and/or Adrian Murdoch's ""The Last Pagan: Julian the Apostate and the Death of the World""."
4,Billy's bootcamp set,"Exccellent training goods ! It is hard to begin with, but soon feel good. I enjoy everyday with it."
4,Nothing to Lose by Reading this Book!,"This is, from the reading of it, quite obviously one of a series.But it is also a decent stand-alone. The story is well written, the plot believable, the main characters well-drawn and like-able.That being said, I found myself wishing, as I read the book, that the author had a hundred or so more pages to flesh out the plot. The culmination of the mystery came too quickly, with not enough real resolution for me. But in this format, there isn't a lot of room to play.Off I go to buy the prequel!"
2,Poorly designed,"There is no way this pendant will lay properly due to the poor design. I'm not thrilled with the color of the stone, either, but could overlook that if the pendant would lay flat as it appears in the illustration."
3,Peace in the storm,"This product was easy to ingest and the instructions were very plain and simple. Its effects were difficult to describe, then, it was supposed to alleviate grief and I have not felt too depressed. I have been able to go to work and be cheerful and attentive to the guests at the hotel where I work. I would recommmend it to others who may be suffering loss from the death of a loved one, as I am."
5,safer than CFL,"I have been using these since there availability in the marketplace. With aging comes challenges: and these bulbs take care of the eyesight one,. They last longer than regular bulbs and I can match my paint colors more accurately {artist]. I stopped using these when the govt told us how to save $$ on our electric bills, and the apt building switched to CFL's. Now I have skin CANCER from constant exposure to ultraviolet rays from the crappy CFL's.So I am now ordering my 3 sizes of reveal and pray my cancer did not turn into the bad kind.Blast the CFL's..maybe I will sue!"
1,what he said,"Mr. Wilner was too kind. He actually turned me on to this paranormal kick, despite the fact that he's a die-hard scientist (not to mention a screaming genius!). This book ain't d*ck. Save your money. The author segues from nonsense to nonsense, occasionally peppering the flow with foolishness or rectaloid flubdubbery. What a disgraceful waste of trees! And, no, this isn't Bruce. I successfully fooled Ye Olde Machyne."
4,Interesting Point of View,"This book defines the Fundamentalist Christian perspective of recent cultural phenomena, such as UFOs, and how these are indicators that we are living in the `end times.'According to the author, Satan was unleashed on earth in the year 1864, and is responsible for all the UFO activity that has happened since. In fact, the author makes a strong argument is made that the so-called `grey' aliens at not extra-terrestrials at all; they are, according to this book, demons. Certainly an interesting theory to add to the UFO debate!Fundamentalist Christians will like this book as it affirms their faith. Non-fundamentalist Christians, UFO buffs, and people of other faiths may also find this book interesting, even if they have a different point of view. It could certainly create some lively debate."
1,doesn't work,I would give this toy 0 stars if the defaults would allow. We received one as a birthday present. It would not light up. We returned it and got a replacement. The replacement does not light up. The phrases don't seem to be working right either but I can't tell for sure since I am not exactly sure what they are suppose to sound like. I think this toy would be really cool ....if it worked.
2,Mediocre at best,"I admit to knowing near nothing about Aleister Crowley before reading this book, and can't say I'm much more enlightened having completed it. It was a dry, un-engaging read for someone known colloquially as ""The Beast."" It had no bibliography as some others have noted, which contributes to the feeling that you are listening to a locker room story - and a bad one at that -about a past school ""bad boy"" rather than reading the biography of an eccentric and controversial man. Meh."
5,Love this product,I have used this product for years. A little dab will do you. Do not overdo it and I think you will like this product too. It makes my hair soft and shiny and that's exactly what I wanted. This company ships quickly and securely. Thanks!
5,In your face goods,"This book opens your eyes to the myths of ""play dead with a griz, fight back with a black."" I realize some of the book had to be tamed down for controversial reasons, but it puts things into perspective. I feel safer in the bush now after reading it!"
5,Awesome!,"This poster would be GREAT for any music teacher's band room, class room, or even room room. I love it! High quality print, and it's HUGE."
1,Pass This Pulp Tale By,"Anyone who is going to embrace this story as classic pulp fiction is deluded. Sure, it has the drinking, the broads, the fights, and the big city setting, but there is not enough in the tale or any of the characters to make the book matter. I have collected the Hard Case Crime series and am reading through them. THere are a lot of hits, but I'm telling you that when the miss there is no middle ground: they miss by a mile.The only interesting thing was seeing characterizations of Truman Capote and the legacy of Hemingway.Forget this one. Pass it by."
1,Misled,"When I read in the Product Features that ""Cast iron heats evenly and retains heat"", I assumed I could heat water in it. Wrong. It came with instructions that indicated it was not for stove top use. That rendered it useless to me, and I returned it."
2,BLOOD AND PUS,"I think Western and Oriental people have rather different mentalities to comprehend and like similar things. Because I didn't understand this ""brilliant, awesome, ingenious and so on and so on..."" flick. When you read the synopsis everything seems to be right and at its place. But then you start watching... Oh, those mentalities...Try to recall ""Visitor Q"" and ""Tetsuo: the Iron Man"" if you watched them, then put them together and add a good amount of surrealism aside from ""Tetsuo"". And you'll get ""Organ"". Or maybe you have to do something more because it's by far more complicated than that. Speaking of ""Tetsuo"" - Kei Fujiwara, the director and actress in ""Organ"" had a part in that movie.Well I don't know what to say maybe I'll have to watch it for the second time so everything becomes clear. Although I doubt it will. And for gore-hounds I can say ""Organ"" is pretty abominable at times, gruesome and morbid. Lots of blood, pus and other excretion. Not for the squeamish obviously."
2,Disappointed,"I thought this product might be the answer, but it's not, at least not for me. Maybe I should have bought the related product that states it's specifically for calluses, but some of the reviews indicated this product worked well on calluses. I don't find that it does. It works well on the heel area, but not anywhere else on the bottom of my foot. The buffer itself is well crafted, very sturdy and cleans up easily. However, for the steep price, I can't highly recommend it."
3,Decent,"This AC cover does what its advertised to; covers all your vents to protect from wind and rain. I find the fabric to be a bit thin but it serves its purpose. The elastic straps that hold the cover on the AC unit work well though I did add an extra bungie to it (for hurricane Sandy - the cover stayed on the whole storm with the added bungee). Being my first AC cover, I didnt realize the cover only went on the top, sides, and back of machine (nothing covers the bottom of your AC); I thought it would slide on like a sock or glove and cover all sides, but the bottom of the unit shouldnt be a concern, being so high off the ground. Still, a little extra protection wouldnt be a bad thing..."
5,Miracle Man is my favorite book,"Even though I have no experience living in the city like Ben Schrank's main character, Kelly Minter -- suburbs-kid turned Spanish Harlem resident -- I found that I connected with him and with the novel in a way I never have with any other. Ben Schrank knows what it's like to be twenty years old, doubtful of your upbringing, and determined to do good for others, and his writing is honest and true to life. He is, thankfully, unafraid to tell everything like it is, and I can't wait to read his next novel. If you've ever dreamed about New York City, questioned your parents' values, wanted to take from the rich, loved someone but were afraid -- or even if you haven't -- you've got to read Schrank's novel."
2,Obselete,Picks up next to nothing as far as signals go even with a digital converter. The ones that it does pick up are constantly breaking up and lagging. Basically a useless product unless you enjoy aggrevation. Only good thing about it is it fits antenna jack on TV perfectly. Too bad it doesn't work. That's kinda the major flaw...lol.
5,Totally unique!,"This Sasha doll is way cool. She even comes with a cute music CD! She comes with 2 pairs of outfits, 3 pairs of dangly hoop earrings, sunglasses, another set of clothes, 2 bratzpack backpacks, a lovely skin colour, collectible card {As seen on bratz toptrumps} and some limited fun!Collect ALL the flashack fever dolls!A little out of fashion- but who knows?THEIR ROCKING IN THE 70'S!!!!!AND THE STUFF MENTIONED- i'LL LET YOU KNOW, IS ONLY A INCH OF WHAT SHE HAS, THERES WAY MORE!"
2,Sound is OK - will not stay on your head,"These earphones sound okay, but they will not stay on your head if you move. I would not recommend this item."
1,Don't Bother,"Maxell should stick to media and stay away from electonics.These head phones are very comfortable and functional but that's where it stops too bad the performance of the product doesn't match the functionality. As a sound engineer I have used many headphones, but I can safely say that 2 tin cans on a string would sound better than these do if not the same."
2,The ear buds fall out...,"These headphones have no intension to keep them on your head. The ear buds fall out of my ears even when I'm just sitting still. There would be no way to use these when you are up walking around, unless maybe you could put a hat on overtop of these to keep them in place. Don't waste your money on these!"
2,I would skip it,"These headphones are too big for my head, so they're very loose and they don't stay in place when I move. I definitely can't use this at the gym, which was supposed to be the purpose of my purchase. Sound quality is ok though."
2,Cheap,Does not look like the picture. Not very high quality. Not very adjustable. If you wear them at a certain angle it will plug your ear so you can't hear. :(
1,Total Loss,"Very disappointed in this product. The earphones are large and don't stay in the ears. The vertical support is flimsy so offers no structure to keep in the ear, wore it once and now it is trash. NO!"
4,Great buy for the money!,"NOt the clearest view, but, for the bucks, who can argue such a close up look at things?"
1,Non-working item shipped to me.,"Item was defective, right side does not focus, original box and everything looks fine but right side does not work, even looking only thru the well working side (left) it has a very poor quality image, using the zoom in full (30x) image loos like when viewing thru the bottom of a glass bottle.This binoculars are a good option to waste your money.The wrost binoculars I have ever try."
1,Wait !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Instead of buying this 20 minute DVD, google and read a few articles. Nothing new here. I'll never recommend this to anyone."
4,A Bit Pricey but Good,"The Idea of Phenomenology is Volume VIII of the recent Husserl's Collected Works Series published by Kluwer. This small text consists of five short lectures (and some immediate post-lecture reflections) given by Husserl in 1907. These lectures represent the first public exposition of his phenomenology and are reminiscent of Descartes' Meditations - in that Husserl grapples with the question of knowledge. Lee Hardy's new English translation is generally clear and readable. Although probably for a limited readership, I recommend it for fans of Husserl and readers interested in the origins of phenomenology."
4,Let the Sith in you run wild,This is one awesome lightsaber. It is really durable. If you're a Star Wars fan I recommend getting it. I have two so my *neybor* and I can duel all the time. This one is totaly better than the electronic ones. They probably last like ten times longer. The only bad thing is that sometimes the blade is hard to get back in. But other than that it is awesome!!!May the Force be with you!!!!!!!!!
1,not a LIGHTsaber!,"Because this was advertised as having an ""on-off"" switch, I believed it would actually turn on and off. Not so. This is strictly a prop. the on off switch is just for show. Also, the extending part of it neither extends nor retracts well. VERY disappointed in the quality"
