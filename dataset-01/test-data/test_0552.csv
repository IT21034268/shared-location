2,Bizarre and mystical,"Despite the impression given by the title, this book does not describe a general ""holistic"" approach, but rather one based on the bizarre and mystical ""anthroposophical"" theories of Steiner. Although the authors' care for the children they work with is evident, their quasi-religious approach means that the book is only likely to appeal to those already prepared to believe that autism is due to problems in the child's karma and the failure of their soul to ""incarnate"" properly."
3,WHAT IS THE REAL TRACK LISTING??!,To anyone who reads this... the track listing for this item is not what is shown on CDNOW and I would like to know if this is the correct track listing or if some one made a HUGE mistake.
3,Nice product but.....,"I've never seen one come before without a belt, and this product had none....nor was a belt listed as an possible add on. I haven't contacted seller as of yet but will do so."
3,Butcher of the Noble,"This is a fairly fast-paced book, loosely based on actual cases here in Virginia. Some of the characters seem a bit overdrawn and, while not a prude, I felt distracted by somewhat gratuitous explicit sexuality. Guess the author felt it would help sell books. All in all, a good read and I'd buy more of this author's work."
1,The title is misleading,The book contains VERY basic instruction for beginning runners. It has absolutely NO information on how to train on the treadmill. It does have some information about how to buy a treadmill. It's a total waste of money. I'm very disappointing and upset that I was mislead...
2,Not for the novice,"This is a well written book that is intended for the person who plans to take treadmill workouts very seriously. It's not aimed at the ordinary person who wants a workout program to acheive good health and cariovascular fitness. It is also heavy handed in it's message selling Precor fitness products. It's irritating and distracting. If you plan to run in a marathon, there are some good workout schedules. But a beginner or someone with little workout experience should keep looking in other places."
3,Good. unless you use it for oak and mahagony application,"Overall, this is good product for the price. Not a single jam, small, easy to work with. Works great in pine and softer woods. However I had to use it in santos mahagony and nails (1"") have been sticking up. Wasn't that bad , but unacceptable if you want to do your work 100%. Again for most of application it works great. I returned mine and got Cadex. No idea how that one will work, didn't receive it yet."
3,Day of the Hunter,"I enjoyed reading this book which tells the story of sixteen year old Johnny Raider who is on the run for the murders of his adoptive family. Johnny is in pursuit of the three men who got away with the murders, while being pursed by three bounty hunters who do not care how they get their man."
2,DESCRIPTION NOT CORRECT,"I purchased this auger and only received 1 bit when the description indicates 5-bulk quantity. I contacted Amazon.com and was given an apology if the description was incorrect or misleading with the option to return the items. If you order thinking you will get 5 augers, you won't. You will get only one. The description still shows 5."
1,"This is hard to read, and I think the author needs God","My opinion in reading half the book, in segments because it puts me to sleep, is that the author is dealing with some deep seeded problems and taking them out on others. I think she needs to get a life and leave the writing and counseling to caring, helpful people."
5,One of the best books I ever read,I recommand everyone who is interested in healing to read and learn from this book. I even recommand to have all her books she is writing her books to guid us and not like others to sell books great information.
2,Disclaimer ahead,"This tape set is actually one cassette of a lecture and one of an in-studio ""interview"" by a publisher's rep. I stopped listening after the first Q&A; of tape 2.Some reviewers have blasted this author for challenging a victim of child abuse. I have my issues with Dr. Myss and her presentations; however, I found her follow-up there valid. This woman had clearly taken on ""victim"" as an identity. Moving on to the larger picture, the lecture itself struck me as having no real point. She stresses forgiveness-as-a-healing-mechanism heavily at the end, yet the preceding talk doesn't support it.As for Part 2, she sounded as though she wanted to be anywhere but at the interview. She appeared either bored or distracted. As a generalization, without going into impressions from her (and others' similar) work, there seems to be a level of burnout where the ""expert"" realizes that (s)he has said pretty much all there is to say, in as many ways as possible."
1,Wide Off The Mark,"Daniel Strachman's Getting Started in Hedge Funds is a poorly written, remarkably uninspiring piece of work. Instead of actually talking about ""getting started in hedge funds"" - the author spends most of his time sketching profiles of the different players involved in the hedge fund industry. I'd venture to say this book offers almost nothing of value to anyone who spends even a minute or two per week perusing financial news and information. Not recommended."
1,Not Enough,"Really, my freshman business students have turned in term papers with more information about hedge funds! I am surprised that some reviewers found this tiny book to be helpful.I can only conclude that they are his best friends or Mom and Dad! Nothing here will enable you to get started in hedge funds! It worries me that people will think this book will give them the information needed to get involved in this complicateed field."
3,Orange is better than this and the lychee gummy,"This has too subtle a flavor for a candy that is gone too fast. I avoided these for a while because I thought they would be sticky, but they are not. The kiwi seeds are a nice touch, but this flavor was boring for something that is gone so fast. Orange is more intense for citrus lovers. I really kept looking for the kiwi flavor. Not horrible, but very subtle and subtle tastes better in a hard japanese candy to me."
4,Each Dawn I Die is an interesting and entertaining movie with a great supporting cast,"James Cagney as ""Frank Ross"" (the framed newspaper reporter) and George Raft as ""Hood Stacey"" (the hardened criminal) present fine performances in this film which gives a good look at life in prison. The film also has a great supporting cast with veteran performers such as Edward Pawley and Maxie Rosenbloom. Pawley gives an excellent performance as a convict named Dale who leads an aborted prison escape attempt."
5,I am new to kettlebell workouts,I bought this along with the Firms DVD and 5 pound kettlebell.I like Gin's approach to instructing the use of the kettlebell you get front and side shots showing you the proper form.The workout is smooth and strickly works with the kettlebell. The segments are at a nice pace. I would reccomend this DVD for anyone starting out.The only issue I have with the workout is that over time and hopefully as I get better with the kettlebell the pace may be a bit slow to keep me interested. Time will tell.
5,Great beginner workout,This workout is a great introduction to kettlebells. The moves are simple yet effective. The workout is broken down into 3 parts but I completed all three at once the very first time doing the video and first time using kettlebells. Miller explains the moves well and is a great instructor. The music is nice too.
5,A nice change to my workout,"I'm a senior who works out to keep fit - and this video certainly helps me do that! I like using the medicine ball for some switch-up in my routine, and the length is just right to ensure that I get my workout in before work. Any longer and I might find a reason for not doing it!And I really like Gin Miller. She motivates me, and I feel like she cares about the people who use her products."
1,Buggy.....!!!!!!!!!!!,Company Don't even list the product for support.Install immediately want's IE 5 or above.I run IE 7 go figure as default.Save your money.
2,Buyer Beware on This Item,"I purchased this item at one of the Warehouse clubs. The price was good and the set worked fine for the first two months. During this time, I did not use the DVD mode on the set. When getting ready to go on a driving trip, I decided to test the DVD portion of the TV. After putting a DVD in the tray, the player would not function. The TV portion and AUX mode were still functioning correctly, but whenever I tried to play the DVD or even open the tray to get the DVD out, the TV would make a few noises then power off. Luckily this happened within the first three months and I was able to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund. I would not buy this product again. I ended up replacing it with a similar Toshiba branded unit and hopefully will have better luck with it."
2,Not worth the money,"I was looking for something that I could use in front of the treadmill for TV, DVDs and MP3 CDs. I ran across this at one of the warehouse stores and thought I'd found heaven. And I could use it in the car on trips to entertain the kiddo.Well, not what I was expecting.For one thing, there isn't an closed captioning, which is nice if the spouse doesn't want to listen to the news with me.Also, the menu system can only be accessed via the hard-to-see-and-use remote control (even more so while running). And the menu system is lacking features that are standard on most DVD and TVs.The tuner sensitivity was below average, leaving most channels snowy and difficult to watch over the rabbit-ears. Picture quality was what was expected on DVDs.I ended up returning it and am still looking for a solution. I will probably end up with a DVD/VCR combo deck and a seperate TV...<sigh>"
5,great,yes you need to order two - got these for my 22 Marlin WMR. and they worked as promised. fit nice and arrived on time and in great shape they re perfect
4,Pleasing,"I bought this toy for the sole purpose of it being a collectors item. I am satisfied with the product generally, seeing that it would only be used for viewing and not actually to play with. I however thought that the attention to details seemed to be less in this particular model as opposed to other models I have bought before eg The Targa, CarerraS, Cayanne,etc. Hopefully the manufacturer is not cutting cost at the expense of quality."
1,What a disappointment!,"A friend loaned me this book, but I forgive her. While the opening chapter was intriguing enough to hold my interest, it was the best part of the book. The idea of the fallen angels is absolutely wonderful and well-researched. Unfortunately, it fell apart quickly after the first two chapters. I thought the romance was silly and childish. The horror/mystical aspects fell flat after the initial premise of fallen angels, and at points it was so overly theatrical it was more boring than intriguing. This author would benefit from taking creative writing courses, unless she actually meant for the book to come off as an amateurish spoof. If that was her goal, she succeeded. I sincerely hope she is not planning a sequel. This reader won't be buying it. I have two kids and a sink full of dirty dishes that are more entertaining."
5,Lowest price on item I needed,"I researched several sites, including Melitta, looking for this particular item. I have used the Melitta stovetop system for over 25 years and used to be able to purchase products locally when I needed them. My last carafe broke and I could not find another. Amazon to the rescue! They had the best price and my product was shipped UPS to arrive in less than a week. I will certainly look to Amazon when I need a hard to find item in the future."
5,Getting back to basics,"I had a Melitta coffee pot back in the 70's and used it to make coffee until the electric coffeemakers started to take over. After several years of tossing out coffee makers that only lasted 4 to 6 months (we make a lot of coffee in our home), I went back to Melitta.This is a tried and true method for making a good pot of coffee and has the added benefit of using less grounds because boiling water from the teapot is hotter than the ""hot"" water an electric coffee maker produces.If you want a good ""hot"" cup of coffee and are tired of tossing away the electric makers, you should buy this. As an added benefit, since it doesn't require electric, if the power goes out and you have a secondary heating source (kerosene heater, etc.), as long as you can heat water, you can have a cup of coffee."
5,Melitta Cone Filter Coffeemaker 10 cup,"Fabulous! I will never go back to an electric one! Fast and easy, and it conserves energy! Coffee tastes great and there is very little to clean. No wet plastic and inaccessible corners to gather mold."
5,Best deal for coffee maker ever!,"I've been using this product for a month now. This goes against the saying ""You get what you pay for"". In this case you get much much more for your money. We just threw out our 2nd Bunn coffee maker. Each bunn gave us about 7 years of use. This takes up less space and makes EXCELLANT coffee! After i make my pot, I pour a cup to drink and the rest goes in a carafe. Rinse the decanter and it's always clean - and no more burnt coffee sitting on the burner. Now it takes a little longer to get your morning coffee, but it's worth it and I have already gotten used to my new way of making coffee."
1,BAD EXPERIENCE !,"WHEN I ORDERED THE MELITTA 10 CUP (WHICH WE LOVE) ON THE SAME PAGE WAS AN OFFER FOR THE MELITTA FILTERS WHICH WE ALSO ORDERED.........WE PAID A VERY HIGH PRICE FOR THEM AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED, THEY WERE NOT FOR THE 10 CUP MELITTA..........I ADVISED THE COMPANY BUT THEY HAD DEAF EARS !"
3,"Gasman, The - This One's For You","IDM is oftentimes a difficult line to ride: you want to be intelligent without being indulgent or pretentious. And the Planet Mu label has been (mostly) successful at keeping things down to earth. The Gasman's _This One's For You_ does feel like an homage to the early days of techno (""Nexium 2"" almost induces acid flashbacks) with a strong harmonic sense and an almost downplaying of the percussion. The tracks here are earnest, which is a refreshing change from the drill-n-noize attitude many others take. ""Creampie"" and ""Digital Din"" give a wink to the toytown techno of the early 90s, and the more beatless ""Goof"" and ""Go (Before You Break My Heart)"" try for a little more tenderness, but, for my money, the more melodic tracks are the ones that rise to the top: the appropriately cool ""Freezer""; the angular ""Crazy Boot Fun House""; the stately ""Chalk"". This one may be for you, but this is an album that anyone can enjoy."
4,Nice pose - but that jetpack!,"I really like how this version of Boba Fett has flames coming out of his jetpack. He can be posed in a bunch of cool ways. However, the jetpack itself isn't accurate, especially the top part, which looks more like a missile launcher. It's too bad, otherwise this figure would have been perfect for displaying."
4,not limited to Java programmers,"The authors take a more informal approach to describing algorithms, than other texts, by Knuth, Sedgewick and Aho. This may appeal to some of you, who might have been put off by the level of mathematical background required by the other books. Or by the rate of exposition of ideas within those books.The presence of problems with each chapter helps your learning. And there certainly seems to be plenty of examples. To me, it seemed like they were belabouring the point, in places. But to you, it might feel like a comfortable dialog.The usage of Java pseudocode is neither here nor there. If you are sufficiently skilled in a programming language, and it need not be Java, then you should have no problem writing out actual code to test the algorithms. In other words, don't worry if you do not know Java. Just imagine it as generic pseudocode."
4,Great for my 5 year old,"I bought this for my 5 year old and he loves it! He takes it everywhere with him and feels like a ""big kid"" as he has his own MP3 player! The lanyard is cheap and broke easily but you can really attach any lanyard to it. The headphones didnt work for my son either but we got some that he likes and so he's good to go. So those are the only two reasons that I rated this a 4 star. The instructions, if you actually read them, says not to use SD cards with more than 80 songs or bad things will happen. My son loves the Disney songs so much we havent needed to add songs to it yet."
1,"bad product, bad service","Originally I want to have this GPS working with my notebook. After two RMAs and long hours w/ the support, I still could not get them to work with my two notebooks. They refused to refund also.Bad service and bad product. Do not buy."
3,problem with CDs,I have a same problem with the below review.So far as... I even have no chance to use this GPS because not only 'setup CD' but also 'map CD' doesn't work. IOGEAR said they will send other CDs but I should wait 1 week more. Don't order this GPS if you need to use it immediately.IOGEAR website doesn't offer download of setup programe.
1,Disappointed,This item did not work when I plugged it in. My stylist also told me the quality of Chi's products have significantly gone down. They do not carry them anymore.
4,CHI,"I got my CHI about a year ago. Works GREAT! No problems so far! Really works well on my hair, and helps keep frizz away which is a big deal because I live in FL! Most other straighteners would work for a couple hours then my hair would begin to curl, but the CHI keeps my hair straight all day! Great product! Totally worth the money if you straighten your hair often!!"
2,"Straight, but balding...","...okay that's a bit of an exaggeration. My thick, course hair is much more managable (and silky smooth) after using the CHI. But if any stray hairs get near the ends of the ceramic plates, they get stuck and are painfully pulled out.... one at a time. It happens every time I use it. I try to make the sections I flat-iron smaller to avoid the problem, but then I find myself pressed for time and, ouch! Am I the only one?"
5,CHI Hair Straightener,"I absolutley love this product. My hair is fairly straight already, but it works great to smooth my hair. I also like how you can use it to curl your hair."
3,looks good,So far everything seems good i got the product very quickly. I wont know anything else till after xmas because it is a xmas gift.thank you
1,Farouk Chi,"I bought this chi through amazon. I used the chi a couple of times and it stopped working. Amazon, however sent me a replacement within days."
3,It doesn't get hot enough to my liking.,The price was a little high for being an old model. But it still does the job of straightening hair.
1,Very poor quality!,"No heat control. Not the quality I expected. To be returned. :-(((((. :-((((((. :-(, :-(, :-(, :-(, :-(, :-(, :-(."
1,NOT worth the money,"I bought this item on April 17, 2012. This item broke on December 23rd. I use this product maybe 3 times a week and there is no reason it should be broken. There is no manufacturer warranty by buying this product on amazon and there is only a 30 day warranty replacement as provided by amazon through this seller. This product hasn't even lasted a year! I am extremely disappointed and there was also not even a response from this seller about my complaint. Do not buy this on amazon or from this seller. ."
4,Good deal,"My daughter had been asking for a ""real"" hair straightener for about a year. Knowing that, ""real"", meant big bucks I was hesitant to purchase one.This past Christmas I was determined to find one at a great deal, so I logged on to amazon.com and was able to find the Farouk Chi for less than $100.She says it heats up fast and works great! That's all I needed to hear to be satisfied with my purchase."
5,Great product,This is such a wonderful product. It does what you want! I have bought some cheaper models and they just don't work as well and the style doesn't last as long. You should definitely get one of these.
4,very happy,works well. heats quickly. would recommend. only draw back is that you can not select different temperatures
1,burns your hair,"It instantly ramps up to a burning hot temperature which damaged my hair in one stroke. There's no temperature setting. When I contacted Nocurls for return, they said I won't get a full refund (bc I used it once) and refused to answer my other questions, regarding stocking fee and such.The most unpleasant amazon buying experience I've had."
1,Broke after 4 months,I am not sure if this is a real Chi my last one lasted 5 years and this one only lasted 4 months. I spent $83 on this flat iron through seller greatservice and it does not have the word Chi on the flat iron at all. I am not a 100% sure if I got a fake or a faulty flat iron but just thought I would mention my experience.
3,Ehhh,"Product is the type and style asked for but I would not buy it again. It is lower quality than buying it from the actual chi store, i don't know how they downgraded it, but they did. It takes longer to straighten my hair."
5,Absolutely worth the money!!,I live in Louisiana and have very curly frizzy hair. The chi straightens it and leaves it silky instead of dried out. It also stays straight in the humidity. I would recommend it to anyone who is not sure about paying this much for a straightener.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!,"This item does not work and I will probably be charged to send it back, not worth the time, buy a Chi from a dealer not online or Farouk will not honor a return!!!"
1,Dead after three months.,"I bought this for a friend. This iron lasted exactly 9 weeks, with one user, once a day.Amazon should stop allowing this product being sold. If they are genuine, they are not lasting like a genuine product. If they are counterfeits, they shouldn't be on Amazon. The warranty is only THIRTY days, and the manufacturer's warranty is void when purchased from Amazon.Not happy customer"
2,"""Farouk"" CHI 1"" hair straightener","This item came well packaged and worked quite well for 6 months, then stopped working. I tried twice to get hold of the seller, with no results. I then contacted Amazon, who said the product did not have any warranty with it. So, I followed the instructions inside the package and shipped it, along with a $35.00 check back to the company for repairs. It was returned to me about 2 weeks later, with a note stating that the item was not an authentic Farouk CHI, but an unauthorized reproduction! Go figure!"
5,AMAZING!,"This straightener is the best one I have ever owned. My hair is very thick and hard to straighten. It used to take me a little over 45 minutes to straighten my hair. With thc Chi I spend 20 minutes tops!! All of my friends own this product and if you're looking for a great buy, this is definitely worth the money!"
5,Love!,This is a GREAT straightener for a GREAT price. Definitely the lowest price I've ever seen for a CHI. I don't have super curly hair so I can't say if it would be powerful enough for that but I have a strong natural wave that straightens out great with this guy. It's also a good size to be able to make curls/waves too.
5,The very best for your money!,"I have found Chis in general to be far superior than any other brand. My cousin is white and she loves it for her hair, which is a very different texture than mine--I'm muli-racial, but I love it for my hair, too. SO, for any type of hair this product is amazing. I love it, it's the easiest most effective way to straighten any hair but especially thick or very long hair because it works so well that you don't have to go over areas again and again."
4,Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron,i think it is a great product. The only bad thing is that it does not close all the way so i had to use my hands to press it to work
2,Save your Money,If you don't mind singing/burning your hair buy this iron! The problem lies in the fact that there is no temperature control so your hair if fine will burn. The burning occurs even when just running the iron through your hair and the resultant smell is hideous!
3,Not for me,"My friend absolutely LOVES her Chi and recommended this for me. I tried it but it just really fried my hair. I am sure I was doing it wrong. It did not come with any instructions at all. So, I'm sure it is a great product if you know how to use it. It just didn't work for me. I had to send mine back. I'm still giving it 3 stars because it probably would be great for someone who knows how to use a flat iron. I am just back to using the blow dryer again."
3,It works,"The iron heats up fast and does what it is supposed to do. My hair is very thick and I have to go through layers to flatten it down, but once I do, it stays in place. The ceramic area is smaller than I thought it would be. I dropped it once and it seemed like I broke it, but I unplugged and plugged back in and it worked fine."
3,Not sure this is the real thing,"I am pretty sure this is a knock of version of a real Chi. The product just seems cheap and ""weird"" ~ while it does work great, I returned it because I want to know I bought the real thing. So I spent the extra $20 and bout a real Chi."
5,Works Better than the Others I've Tried,"I've used a lot of hair straighteners and a lot of them have burned my hair and killed it in so many ways, but this one was different. You would think that something this cheap wouldn't work as well as the hundred dollar ones, but it has held up perfectly, and better than ones I've previously bought. I'm so glad to have this, it curls and everything. Take it from someone who's tried a lot of different straighteners, it's great."
1,Disappointed.,"From my experience, products with a lot of hype tend to disappoint, and the chi just reinforces that.It did not last very long for me --- electrical circuit ruined in less than a year, and if it is purchased online, the warranty does not cover it anymore."
1,Poor Quality and Support,The power switch on this unit started malfunctioning after only eight months of use. The company did not reply to our requests for warranty service. I'll stay from Farouk products from now on.
2,Not Impressed,"I had the same straightener for about 4 years, and I loved it. Since purchasing a new one from Amazon, I have not been impressed. The quality is not near as good as my first one- in which I do not know why if they are the same. The ends don't completely meet on one end and I think this is where the problem is. Not sure if its the supplyer or just a bad one, but I am not impressed and regret the online purchase. I should have gone to store to avoid this mishap. But I do love the CHI straighteners. Just not this one."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS STRAIGHTENER,"DO NOT BUY THIS STRAIGHTENER. YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. I have purchased this exact straightener TWICE now, and both times I was initially pleased with the way my hair looked and felt, but then less than two months after purchasing (and this happened BOTH TIMES) I would be in the middle of using it, and suddenly it would shut off, and never work again. I think it has something to do with the plug. The first time, I thought maybe it was a fluke, or even my fault, so I just bought a new one. Now that the exact same thing has happened again, I know better. Either way, both times I was out eighty bucks for a straightener that is supposed to work better than the $20 ConAir ceramic straightener that lasted me five years. This is a CHI for goodness' sake!! THIS SHOULDN'T HAPPEN. And because I purchased it here on Amazon, the Chi company won't take responsibility and fix what is broken. I am furious."
2,Defective,The price was great and I'm sure this is a good product but mine didn't work when I received it. Very disappointed.
1,Do not buy a CHI from Amazon!!! NO WARRANTY!!!,I loved buying Amazon until I purchased this product from them. It worked great until it broke 6 months after I bought it. I contacted Amazon but unfortunately its not warrantied through them or the manufacterer. That really sucks. I bought a cheap flat iron before this CHI that cost me $50.00 and it lasted years. I don't recommend the CHI to anyone. This was my first CHI and the last one.
4,Good product,"Fast shipping. Product is good. Looks like the heating plates, when you close the flat iron, are a little off - not straight. But overall good flatiron."
4,Farouk flat hairstyling iron rocks!,"I purchased this flatiron to try to tame my very frizzy hair. It's a snap to use (believe me, I am NOT good at hairstyling) and it works fast. The variable temp. setting is great, you have to play around a little to find the right temperature for your hair, but the hair doesn't burn. I found it a little heavy to work with, especially when doing the back of my head."
2,only worked for 2 months,"was promised a replacement, they requested my address to send a replacement but even after my follow-up never got the replacement."
4,"When it works, it works well.","The first CHI that arrived worked a few times, then abruptly stopped, then worked intermittently. Since it was within the 30-day return period, I contacted Amazon and they promptly exchanged it for another new one at no cost to me. Kudos to Amazon for their great service!!! The second one has been working well so far. I found out from friends that it is not uncommon for the CHI to have problems with the cord shorting out... so beware. I am pleased with the CHI as a hair straightener. The price I purchased the CHI for on Amazon was definitely cheaper than ANYWHERE else I have found it.UPDATE October 2009: The replacement CHI has stopped working. This one lasted for just over a year. :-( I've purchased a different brand to replace it."
3,it works,"This product arrived on time but i am not sure it if its an original ""CHI"". The words peeled off within days of it arriving with minimal use. It gets hot quickly and it works well but i dont things it an actual ""CHI"" product."
1,Piece of garbage,"Had one of these for two years. My wife only used for about half that time while changing hair length. The screw that holds the whole thing together broke and arouk would not replace or repair it. Cheap piece of crap. Wife bought a generic version from drug store chain and this one is working fine. Worst company i have ever dealt with, they do not back up their products, stay away from this one!!!"
1,NOT FOR BLACK HAIR!! LEFT MINE FRIED AND DRY,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. I WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THESE BUT AFTER USING THEM I WANTED TO CRY. I DIDNT EVEN FINISH IRONING MY HAIR. THE PART I USED THEM ON IS DRY AND FEELS CRUNCHY AND HAS NO SHINE AT ALL WHICH MAKES NO SENSE BECAUSE I USED HAIR GREASE WITH THEM. AND THEY DONT EVEN GET THAT HOT! I HATE SO MUCH THAT I GOT THESE AND THE DAMAGE I MAY HAVE DONE TO ME HAIR.....AND I THOUGHT CHI PRODUCTS WERE ACTUAL QUALITY NOT SO FROM WHAT I CAN SEE
5,Great !,My niece wanted this for Christmas...she said it's just perfect. ( Always want to keep the family happy :) )
3,Works well but didn''t last long,"It worked really well (as told by my wife), but it lasted only six months, before it burned up. When this happened, I checked the connection and a possible short circuit on the input cable, but found no problem there, so the only thing left is an internal problem."
1,Do not buy this straightner,"This straightner worked great... for one month only. In the middle of using it one day, it just stopped working. I did not leave it plugged in or anything.. it just stopped working. Don't waste your money."
1,it broke after a month of buying it,It broke after about 30 days of use. I bought it for my daughter who is 17 and is very gentle with it. I'm getting in touch with the company to see if I can get a new one!!!!!!!
1,JUNK,So I really thought that this was a great deal. I had heard so much about the CHI and I was so happy to get one on sale. I received it in the mail promptly and was in love it. To my HORROR not even 2 MONTHS after I purchase this flat iron it WILL NOT heat up. Of course this is conveniently 3 weeks after the return option expired. DO NOT BUY THIS FLAT IRON
3,"Its Okay, but not overly impressive!","I expected a little more from this product. Beware, there is no heat adjustment, so you just have an on or off. Therefore, it is a little too hot to use on my five year old. I tried some else's Chi, which led me to purchase this one, they said get any of them, but apparently this one isn't as good. I switched from a Hot-tools (ceramic), which still works great but is getting little worn, its about 5 years old. I don't think there was much of a difference from the first day I used the Hot-Tools and the Chi. I thought that the Chi wouldn't smell like burning hair when I used it, but it does! So, Its okay, but I think you could go with any Ceramic. (BTW I have mixed hair, if this helps)"
5,Love the Chi!,"I didn't think this would make a difference. I own five straighteners now, including the chi. All the other ones are cheapo brands, drug store $20 straighteners.I had this on my watch list because I didn't want to spend so much money for a bad product. I talked myself out of it. Then I used my friend's. OMG! It makes your hair so NICE, just soft and silky.I found mine at costco for $60.00 which is FAR below even the cheapest price I've seen here. Worth it."
3,"Worked great, while it lasted.","Although I read many reviews about this item breaking within a short period of time, I took a chance and purchased it through Amazon. Well, it worked great.. gets very hot and does not have a temperature control, but does the job. Received it in the mail at the beginning of October, and it just stopped working, at the end of November! It smelled like something was burning inside of it, so I turned it off. Well, it won't turn back on. As other reviewers have stated, the warrantly is voided if purchased from Amazon. If you take a chance on this item, good luck."
2,"great but broke in 1 year, overpriced too!","I'll be quick (there are so many reviews out there, I won't be redundant & say what they're all saying), it's great but mine broke in a year (a year & 2 weeks, just over the warranty!). With this price ($75-100) you think they'd make it super tough, but no! My Jilbere de Paris ceramic flat iron had the same features but that only cost me $30! Buy Babyliss BABNT2091T Pro Nano Titanium Digital Ceramic Ionic Iron 1-1/4"" instead - with that brand you can set the settings digitally so that if you have super thick, unruly hair you can max it out to 450 (professional salons who do ""Brazilian Keratin Treatment"" or BKT need it this high), plus you get a 4 year warranty! I've had the Babyliss almost 2 years and still looks new!"
3,Chi Flat Iron,"For the past few years I have used a cheap Revlon flat Iron. I just got a short haircut that requires me to flat iron my hair all the time. The Chi flat iron is better than my old cheap one, however it is not as good as I thought it would be. I still have to go over my hair that is kinky 3 or 4 times to actually straighten it. I advise doing more research before you buy a flat iron. I am very glad that I did not pay full price for this flat iron! On the other hand I would rather pay 150 bucks for a flat iron that saves me time, rather than 50 bucks on a flat iron like this one. I just don't have an hour to sit around and flat iron my hair!!"
4,Great Product!,This product is durable and east to use. My daughters and I share the flat iron and have no problems with it.
4,Great product,"I love the product , it works brilliantly making my naturally wavy hair straight in seconds without doing any damage. Since I frequently travel it would be great if there could be a smaller lighter version, as it is not lightweight, otherwise I highly recommend it.New York"
1,BROKE after only 3 weeks!!!,"This product is crap. It broke after ONLY 3 weeks of use. It just flat out stopped working? I wonder if its fake. Either way, I am disappointed in Amazon's quality assurance."
1,A huge disappointment!!,"I paid nearly $100 for this iron less than a year ago and it's already broken. The swivel cord is either loose or broken and I have to wiggle it to get the light to stay red and heat up. Ridiculous. I have heard from several sources that their customer service is deplorable so I won't be wasting my time. Just bought the HSI, hoping for better luck."
1,Will damage your hair,This flatiron is overrated and overpriced. It damaged my hair when it worked at all. I would have been better off using nothing. My Sedu flatiron is miles better.
1,Broke after 3 uses - make sure you keep your receipt around.,"It was in fact nice while it worked, however briefly. Alas, after 3 usages it never turned on again.I did not keep the packing slip and was unable to return it (a few months passed between usages). Don't make that mistake! Keep your receipt and box around for a while on this one.Hopefully you won't have the same experience I did, but be aware that the quality of the electronics in this item is very questionable, even though the design and manufacture feels quite solid."
1,worked great for one month,The chi worked perfectly for about one month and then it would not turn on when plugged in even if we hit the reset button. We tried everything. I am not sure why it quit working. It was only used by one person and we did not have a power shortage or anything. I have had another chi that lasted for years.
3,Item good,"I really enjoyed the product until it broke soon after I bought it, but the company was really easy to work with to get my money back."
4,PACKAGE LOOKED OLD,DESCRIPTION ON WEBSITE STATED BRAND NEW. BOX LOOKED OLD AND APPEARED TO BE RE-TAPED. IRON WORKS FINE SO FAR.Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron
1,Bad product,"It was not a original product. It broke a few months after I bought it. Got it fixed once, and broke again very soon. I just got a new one from Ulta."
1,Broke after 2 months,"i have owned CHIs before, but this one broke after only two months. I was very disappointed. I spent a lot of money for it to only last 2 months. I will not be buying a Chi again."
4,"CHI 1"" ceramic flat iron",This flat iron really does the job! It's gets hot really fast and stays hot for the whole entire time! I can do my hair the night before and it only takes abuot 15 minutes. My hair gets straight and shiny. The only thing is that I don't konw how to use it as a curling iron. I thought you could use it to curl the hair as well. It's light weight and well made! I love it!
5,Great Job..,I think it's the last flat iron you'll ever buy..well unless you desire the larger version. Excellent job..smooths hair ends..leaves hair light and soft..
5,Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron,"I love this product, I have very thick hair and this is the only flat iron I have used that will straighten and work on my hair. This is my 2nd Chi flat iron and I would not buy anything else."
5,love it,"This is a great product, my hair has never looked better and i have had no problems with the Chi. Seller was great, product was delivered in 4 days, recommend it and this seller"
5,LOVE!,"I've had this for almost 3 years and it's still perfect. It heats quickly and does the job! If you have thick hair like me the trick is to straighten small segments of hair at a time. Don't try to do too much at a time or it won't straighten properly. I'll probably spring for a 2 inch chi one of these days, but for now this is great. I'd like to add that I did receive a real one. I thought it was a fake bc of the great price, and looked for some guides online on how to spot a fake...turns out I have the real thing. Just look up a guide if you buy this and double check it upon delivery."
4,Worth every penny!,"If you've been eyeing this product contemplating whether or not it is worth purchasing (as i did), all i can say is JUST BUY IT ALREADY!This product does a waaay better job than the cheapy brands i use to purchase (and i've bought plenty). It heats up very quickly and straightens my hair perfectly."
2,Very cheaply made,"The item was made from very cheap plastic and felt rather flimsy--I have seen and owned straighteners that have been much more solidly built for the same price.The CHI also wasn't anything special in terms of hair styling. It did its job, but I wasn't blown away--its a ceramic straightener like any other.I returned it promptly after receiving it. In the end, it simply wasn't worth it."
5,Great Product,"This is the best flat iron in the market. It was my second purchase. However, when I used it for the first time, it was pulling and breaking my hair. I am sure there was something wrong with this particular flat iron since my experience from my first CHI was EXCELLENT. I had to return and purchase another one."
5,CHI Style,"I've had a salon-grade ceramic flat-iron before. I must say that this one is great because its fairly lightweight and gets very hot quickly, which allows for quick and easy straightening."
1,This is a knock-off- Don't waste your money!,"Real Chi's are made in USA, these are made in Korea. Very cheap... fried my hair! Do not buy!!!!"
5,Very satisfied with product and price!,I have wanted a CHI flat iron for a while. I am satisfied with the product and price I paid.
3,Worked like charm...once,The first time I used this iron it made my hair look really nice. But after I used it for a couple weeks...I started getting split ends and my hair is still frizzy and a little puffy after use. Makes me wonder if there are right/wrong ways to use the flat iron...
5,I love it!,My wife's hair is really pretty now that she has this product. I'm glad she listened to her stylist's recommendation to buy this product.
2,Chi has gone downhill.,"This is the same model and brand I've owned since I started buying flat irons when they first came out. I ordered it to replace the one I've used almost every day for three years when the cord started separating from the body. The new one is noticeably more cheaply made. It does heat up just like the old one did but the hinge joint feels loose, the cord stiff and cheap and the whole thing like a light plastic toy compared to the old one."
5,Chi power,"This product works so well, heats up fast, and is a godsend for those with wavy or frizzy hair!"
2,Sparked after a month,Used this straightener for one month before it started sparking. Decided to return it and was surprised to learn that I missed the cutoff to return by one day. I won't buy Chi again. Should have listened to other reviewers who complained about return policy. Very disappointed.
1,falls apart,"i have purchased 4 of the chi altogher two for myself and two for my daughter everyone of them had issues three had faulty cords,2 the ceramic fell out after one year of normal use. last purchase i will make. for the price they should last along time"
1,Be Wise.,"The Chi worked well but It was not what I would describe as the best flat iron I've ever tried. I have very thick hair and I found I still frizzed a bit after using it. Even though I only used it roughly 8-10 times in the month that I owned it, the product stopped working for no apparent reason. I am sure it was a faulty product. The vendor never responded for refund but Amazon did so I am grateful for that. I will probably try a higher end product for my next flat iron purchase. Thank you Amazon for standing behind the merchandise even though the vendor did not."
2,"loved it, then it stopped working.","I bought this product about a year ago. Within the past few months, it started working only intermittently--it would heat up, and then the red light would turn off and it would get cold again. It's now unreliable and doesn't stay hot. I just can't get the light to stay on. I'm annoyed that I spent about $80 on it. I don't know if I'll ever bother with an expensive flat iron again."
3,"Soft, Silky, Smooth","So I bought this exact one from Amazon and used it for exactly a year, but then it broke. It just stopped working. Like others have pointed out, the warranty is void if you purchase it through Amazon so you have to take your chances I suppose. Before it broke it worked perfectly though!"
5,Great Buy,"I badly needed a new flat iroon after I've been using a cheap drugstore brand for about 2 years. I was really skeptical about this CHI because I knew CHI didnt have an official Amazon retailer. Nonetheless, this one seems to be genuine enough. Shipping was really fast and the quality of the flat iron was perfect. It straightend my hair in under 20minutes and left it soft and shiny. I'm very glad I invested in this, great buy."
1,DO NOT BUY CHI FROM AMAZON!!,"The two year warranty that CHI products normally come with is actually a zero seconds warranty if you buy from Amazon. They are not an authorized reseller. We bought this product less than two months ago and it has already died, but the folks at Farouk CHI say ""tough luck."" We were replacing an existing CHI product with the same model number that we bought through a hair stylist years ago. Looking at the new one from Amazon, I can say with certainly that the quality is just not the same. Could (some of) these be knock-offs? That would explain why they are dropping like flies."
1,stopped working after 5 months,worked great for my girlfriend for about 5 months.....her previous one lasted 10 years so obviously this product is inferior.keep looking.
1,THIS IS NOT A GENUINE CHI,"I was excited to purchase this flat iron at such a drastic discount. I should have known better. The product I received was not a genuine CHI and I was not impressed with it at all. It did not live up or come anywhere near to the expectations I had based on all the rave reviews for CHI flat irons out there. In fact, the ""CHI"" flat iron that I received performed at a lesser standard than my old HOT TOOLS flat iron that I have had for over 10 years! I tried to return the product today, only to find out that the return window has already passed. This purchase disappointed me, but as I said before, I should have known better based on the price. GENUINE CHI flat irons just DO NOT SELL FOR THIS LOW A PRICE. I just purchased a GENUINE CHI for less than $90 from Ulta and am hoping it will actually knock my socks off like I was expecting this one to.DO NOT BUY THIS CHI IT IS NOT GENUINE AND YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!"
1,Defective Flat Iron - WARNING,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT JUST LAST MONTH AND WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT IT JUST STOPPED WORKING AFTER 1.5 MONTHS. THE FLAT IRON JUST DOESN'T TURN ON ANYMORE EVEN AFTER RESETTING IT SEVERAL TIMES. NATELLA NEVER RESPONDED TO EMAIL ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND CONCERN. I WARN ALL FUTURE BUYERS, ONCE THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED THEY WILL TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY. AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
1,THIS CHI WAS A FAKE,"I bought this piece thinking it was an actual CHI but when it stopped working less than a year later, I decided to send it in to the Farouk company to get it fixed. The result: they could not fix it because it was not a real CHI! A waste of $65Identifying a fake:When I was looking at the instruction papers I noticed there were quite a few typos and spelling mistakes and I thought it kind of strange, now I understand why...this is not a real CHI."
4,Great Product,This is a great hair straightner. I can't believe I waited this long to get a Chi..definately worth the price!
4,Good buy for the price,"this iron works very fast if its on very hot, however, if it is the hair becomes very dry, like straw. and if i set it to lower temperature, it takes forever."
4,Fabulous hair straightener,"This hair straightener works like no other. It gets so hot and straightens the first time you run it through you hair. It heats up in less than one minute. Don't worry about the flashing light, it only means that it's ready for use. The reason I only gave four stars was because of the service from the seller, not because of the item. It was slow ship and the seller never responded to my messages and lied about the warranty. They made me believe I could get a refund or get it fixed through them if it broke after I received it but that was not true, they have no warranty!!! Beware!This item was a great deal for what I paid, I highly recommend it!"
5,Worth every penny!,"I chose this flat iron because my new hair stylist swears by this one. I have been using a different flat iron, for years, on my long curly, frizzy hair at home. (I honestly thought that mine was really good.) Wow - when I tried out this one I was amazed at how silky, straight and shiny it made my hair. It was far better than the previous one I had been using for so long. I recommend this particular Farouk CHI 1"" because it is lightweight, especially when you have been holding it for quite some time. I've tried the 2"" but it is quite heavier and clumsier. This sturdy flat iron gets very hot as well. It instantly heats up to one factory pre-set temperature but it is quite sufficient. It does the job extremely well!!! Just because this flat iron is a bit cheaper and not as high tech-looking as the other CHI's out there don't underestimate it. This 1"" plate handles the job with flying colors. You won't regret purchasing it. My hair has never looked so good!"
4,"great product, only temporary","I loved this product...the 3 times I was able to use it. I purchased it through Amazon for around $90 not including shipping, etc. Soon after, I traveled home for winter break and when i arrived, the reset button on the cord would not depress. If you can't depress the reset button, the Chi Iron will not turn on. When I tried to get an exchange for it, I found out that the warranty does not cover purchases made on the Internet. So, I wasted my money on what was a temporary good purchase. Just something to think about."
1,Not good!,"I have a Sedu flat iron and decided to purchase the Chi because I read the reviews and lots of people said the Chi was great. WRONG, WRONG, WRONG !!! I am African American female and I swim each week. I need an iron that will straighten my hair and not dry it out because of the constant chlorine and washing. I used the Chi last night and it dried my hair out. My hair has never looked like this. It used to have body and was shiny. I am returning the Chi tomorrow for a refund. I am going back to the Sedu- don't think they sell it on Amazon but the Sedu is a great iron. The Chi is awful."
3,disappointed,I bought a chi about 7 years ago and stop working so I bought another and was very disappointed. It was not as good as the old one and gave it to my daughter for her birthday. I am in the process of looking for a different flat iron. One that gets hot enough as my old one.
1,Crap,Purchased for my daughter for Christmas. Didn't even last till Valentines Day! I'm as hot as this flat iron SHOULD HAVE BEEN. Very disappointed.
3,Short Life Span,I had this product 2 years and the heating element blew up. Until that point I loved my CHI never had a bad thing to say about it until today. I am unhappy over the short life span. For the price I would expect a product to last longer than 2 years. I am disappointed. I also learned my sister who bought her CHI a little over a year ago had her's die on her too. Guess things aren't made to last anymore.I will not be buying a CHI for my next flat iron.
4,Great price for a CHI,"I am so glad that I purchased the CHI hair straightener. I straighten my hair every morning and I realized that my hair was drying out from using cheaper straighteners. I bought a CHI and it makes my hair silky, smooth and very straight. The only thing that I do not like about the product is that I cannot change heat settings, it only comes one way. But other than that, it works very well on my wavy hair."
2,Americans in Exile,"I first read China Gate in 1983, and was taken by the scope of a time and place that was ignored during the Vietnam War. Arnold, as an expatriate dependent going to high school in Taiwan, captures a good deal of the street life and culture I knew at that time (1963) stationed at Linkou. While the story is a fast-paced action work, it also reveals a scary side of ""Americans in exile"" that Statesiders wouldn't recognize. Characters are well-developed, although the pidgin English is somewhat forced. I find myself re-reading China Gate every few years, remembering ten-cent drinks, American-style clubs now forgotten, and bargirls--ah, the bargirls. Thank you, Mr. Arnold."
3,BUYERS BEWARE,"All three stories were steamy! Not a bad book if you like HOT READS! Lori Foster and Janelle Denison are two of the best romance authors out there. But, If you are buying this book because you can't get enough of Lori Foster, BEWARE. The story ""TANTALIZING"" was released by Harlequin in 2004 in a book called ""Lip Service"" and is now being rereleased in this book. So, if you're buying this book hoping to find another one of Lori Foster's hard to find stories, you will be disappointed."
3,Not as good as Drag race,I'd said it just soso .not as good as the drag race /But is okay .three starts for the show
1,Very disappointing,"I was very excited to watch the first show of All Stars. After watching the first episode, I stopped watching. It wasn't at all about ""talent"" of the queens, it was about favorites. To me, this season was so unfair and not worth watching or owning. I am sorry to those that liked the season. I didn't."
4,Pairs aren't better,"The singles had it. With twin sets it's hard to pick the one you love. But, I'm a fan and I watch whatever you crank out as long as you keep bringing it."
5,Excellent battery-seems to last forever.,"I have used this battery in my Olympus since I first got it five years ago, and I take a lot of pictures, between kids, vacations, and Ebay photos. I originally thought I would invest in rechargeable batteries, but I had such poor luck with batteries not charging or the charger not working that I decided to keep using this battery. In 5 years, I have only used 3 sets of batteries. I bought my first set at Circuit City for $20, so this is a good price here at Amazon. I felt obligated to write this review because the first and only review had nothing to do with the battery whatsoever, yet he still gave it only one star. Go figure."
5,stay connected to teenager,It really helps to be able to feel you are doing as much as you can. Reading a book that is detached from your situation helps you to look at a problem in a different way and see the obvious.....which was lost when in the heat of your own problems.
4,Does what it promises to quite an extent,"This book does indeed discuss many aspects of phonological representations (as opposed to rules), and takes a fresh approach in its later chapters. It is not, however, as radical a departure from the main paths of phonology post-SPE as it is made to appear in the publisher's blurb. This is still a largely logico-formalistic approach to psychologized phonology, not a psycholinguistic one. Nor does the author have great knowledge outside of that post-SPE mainstream. Overall a very good read, and well-written, even for the linguist (or linguist in training) whose main area is not phonology. In a word, it is commendable."
3,general introduction book for biological science,"This book is only provided general information for biological science.The main part is focus on the drug information, which can be found in the public resources.Little information is mentioned about how to develop a new drug.Thus, it is suitable for undergranduate student reading, not for academic research."
4,Great product!,"Original item arrived broken but Amazon quickly picked up & refunded. I found same item locally since our camping trip was just a few days away. We had 8 adults and 9 kids all using this toilet. We did not use the bags but instead dug holes and sat the toilet above the hole, filling it in with dirt after use. This product feels flimsy but holds up wonderfully. We had adults as large as 300 pounds using this with no complaints."
3,I have used this one time,"I'm 6,3 and 230lbs. I have only used this one time, and it works fine but its small for me."
4,Well it serves it's purpose,"I needed to poop and it works. I recommend just saving the bags because it's easier to just bury it in the wild then to hold on to it, attracting bugs."
1,This toilet is not a toy but might as well be!,The bag slips out of the flimsy lock ring! Now I know why others dig a hole and set the toilet over it! I cannot do that on a pontoon boat. The idea was to keep our lake and reservoir water clean where there are no pump outs and potty dump stations. It is a total failure for my intended use!
3,Bacon is Shakespeare,"After reading Huston's convincing case for Oxford I discovered abook by Penn Leary titled ""The Cryptographic Shakespeare"",Westchester House, 1987. By decoding passages marked byvarious hints, Leary shows that Francis Bacon's name is encodedin over 100 passages. If you read one book, be sure to readthe other"
3,"Nice cookware, but starting to peel","We got this cookware a little less than a year ago. It is really great to use, and the padded handles are very comfortable and stay cool. The 8 inch skillet unfortunately is already showing signs of peeling the nonstick coating, and things are sticking badly. Although we do follow the care instructions, we do use this pan at least once and sometimes twice a day, but I would have wanted the coating to last at least a little longer."
1,Does not hold charge.,"I have spent hours dealing with kodak on this horrible battery that would not hold a charge (no flash, didn't use the digital viewfinder, ect.) but still could only get a couple pics per charge, and I did condition the battery per kodak's instructions. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA! My parent's have an Olympic and do not have this problem. And Kodak's customer service is rude, can't spell, and no help. THERE IS NO WARRANTY ON THEIR BATTERIES, just the camera."
5,3Q Electrostatic Ionic Air Purifier,Wow I have had this now for over 4 months and I just love it.I have it in the bedroom and it has just become white noise for us. It is not overly loud and does a great job with the dust. I use to have a terriable time with the dust in the bedroom now there is none. I reccomed this produc. You may need two if you have a large room to use it in though. I am going to purchase another one for the living room.
4,Good for a small room?,"I originally placed this in my kitchen/keeping room area and it made it smell so fresh and wonderful. I have moved it to my science lab that has lots of odors and it does nothing. I check the collection plates and nothing is there. I am not giving up on it yet, though! It is very easy to use and operate."
2,Almost useless,The fan moves such a small amount of air (very low cfm) that it is almost useless. I can blow some smoke at it about a foot away and it won't draw it into the cleaner.
2,SoLo: So-so,"While a must for the Boingo fan -- posterity and all -- there's a reason why most of the music here wasn't released under the Oingo Boingo banner (despite the fact the entire band is present). Most of the songs sound quickly spun-off, highly synthesized (in the early eighties way), and are, frankly, unmemorable. ""Gratitude"" is the only real standout, although there are some ""catchy"" bits later in the album (if catchy is all you care about)."
1,Stay Away,The original one shipped to me didn't work (shut off after a minute). The replacement one didn't work either...it wouldn't even power on! What a piece of junk. Definitely the last time for me ordering anything with the Tripp Lite brand name on it.
1,Horrible,"I have loved all Andre Norton works in the past. This looked like another good book- I was wrong. The book rambled and was just about the worst book I have ever read. I'm not sure why I finished it, it was a waste of my life. I have not read anything by Susan Shwartz but if this book is indicative of her work it does not bode well."
5,Dee-lightful!,"Very enjoyable--the authors' technique of letting us ""eavesdrop"" on the 2 meddlesome deities was fun. I guess deities don't have enough to do any more! Hari, the main character, often seems to be just a bit of flotsam on the waves, getting washed up in the darnedest places.But, catlike, he always lands on his feet. Or sometimes in another more interesting position! CLHaass"
2,BP failures undermine some of the claims made in this book,"There is almost a whole chapter in this book that discusses BP's organizational design and system of performance contracts as a great implementation of Roberts' ideas. John Browne, former CEO of BP, endorsed the book. Browne and other executives have interacted with Roberts in sessions of executive training at Stanford Business School, where Roberts is based.BP, as everybody is well aware now, has been prone to major failures, the most recent of which was the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, but also the explosion of a refinery at Texas City in 2005. The US based Chemical Safety Board and academic Andrew Hopkins ( in his book Failure to Learn) have convincingly argued that the organizational structure of BP, and in particular the system of performance contracts put in place at BP, contributed to the Texas City disaster.In view of these facts, the claims made by John Roberts in this book should be read with caution."
4,C3P0,My son was extremely happy with his c3p0 action figure. Made for a very merry christmas and a happy new year.
1,I want those two hours of my life back.,What a waste. I doubt I could even sell it for .99 at the used book place.
3,"Good enough book, but lucky break","While this book is a good enough, light read, it would NEVER have been made/released if it weren't for the Bachelor. If you are a fan of Guiney's you will like it; other than that, it's another story that shouldn't really have made it to print. He's not out finding cures for cancer or anything, and he's getting money out of the story of his life. While I like him, I can't honestly recommend this to any serious reader."
4,Using camera,"Very good camera. This was a present for my wife as she needed a new camera. She picked it out and liked that it came as a complete kit. Directions can be hard to follow at times and could be printed larger. Takes some getting used to. Zoom lense works great and takes good pictures. Where the on-off button is so close to the shutter, you have to be careful that you don't accidentally shut the camera off. She is very satisfied with it."
2,Blurry pictures,"Bought this camera to have better print pictures than what I get with the digital. I've tried using it in every mode AUTO, close-up, etc. but the autofocus never works so most of the pictures come out blurry!My older simpler camera took better pictures."
5,Unbelievable.,"This is the stuff hallucinogens bow before. The warning states that it's not for anyone with poor heart conditions, high blood pressure, or contemplating pregnancy, ever. And it means it.One drop of this sauce in anything will have your eyes watering and your stomach curdling. Why it's in a bottle this big I'll never know, but this stuff is the real deal. I was foolish enough to have three drops in a shot of vodka one fateful night many moons ago, and I still tremble at the memory.I can't rate it high enough, so five stars will have to do."
5,good stuff,"arrived timely. it was the right price, and it was almost hot enough. my friends really enjoyed it and really like the two items i ordered."
2,"Too hot, plain and simple","This stuff is so hot it's unpleasant, but for some reason, I still use it on some of my foods, mostly Mexican dishes. Is it for the algedonic experience that I keep using it and not throwing it away. It overpowers anything you're eating, so really you're eating the meal to tame the burn a little. It does have a burnt/smokey flavor that other reviewers have noted. I will stick with Melinda's XXXXtra Hot Reserve Habanero Hot Sauce for most of my hot sauce needs."
3,Hubby love this sauce,I thought this sauce was hotter and different than the Ultimate Insanity sauce due to the name of it but it turned out to be the same exact thing. Otherwise this is my hubbys favorite hot sauce.
3,Pillow Loses Its Shape by TWO Weeks!,"I am giving this pillow three stars because it has helped me sleep for TWO whole weeks, which is amazing! However...after less than two weeks the cotton batting in the pillow has already lost its shape in the places I need support the most... it looks clumpy, like other pillows I have had for YEARS... also the lining cuts into my neck/shoulder... just a few warnings about this pillow...only buy it if you are desperate for a bit of sleep :)"
4,Diffinitely better than 4 pillows,"Before getting this product, i was using 4 regular pillows, one between my legs, under my head, in my arms and behind my back to support. However, when I woke up, all of them were gone. This Body Pillow solved the problem; u-shaped really helps to support my back when lying on the side."
4,Great support,This body pillow is really worth the price. When the box came I was surprised at how big and heavy it was. I was expecting a pillow to be squished and flatted from the packaging. I have used it the last couple weeks and now that I and 6 months pregnant and getting body aches it is a life saver. There is plenty of stuffing it doesnt go flat through out the night. I would recomend this to all of my pregnant friends!
3,"Large, not meant for tall people","I bought this pillow because of backaches I'd wake up with every morning. My observations aren't anything new that hasn't been mentioned before, but I'm returning it because:1. I'm 5""8 and found my legs hanging off the ends during the night, which caused me to wake up with occasional joint aches. (I'd have to support my legs with another pilow, which helped a little)2. It was too large, and took up a good part of our queen bed.3. The backsupport would move during the night, so I would still wake up with backaches.4. It could become very hot sleeping with so much pillow around you.It was comfortable to go to bed with at night, as I did like the insulated, cushy feel. But because of the aforementioned issues, I decided that the cons outweighed the pros."
3,Annoying Seam,"I really like the pillow and it helps me, but I have had to add a pillow in the center because the material used for the liner and cover does not stretch or give and the seam in the neck area is tight and puts pressure on any part of your body that happens to rest there. Very poor design. I am going to have to make my own liner and case, which is a real bother."
2,Just Not Comfortable,"I put off purchasing this pillow, since it's on the expensive side. I had a lot of back pain at night, starting around my 5th month of pregnancy. When I finally gave in, I had high hopes. Unfortunately, I just could not get comfortable with this pillow. It's huge, but we have a king-size bed, so that wasn't really a problem. It felt comfortable for the first 10 or 15 minutes, but then I started to feel claustrophobic in it. It's very difficult to move once you're positioned in it. It's also very difficult to get in and out of it for those VERY frequent trips to the bathroom. It comes with a cover, which is a nice feature; however, the cover is nearly impossible to get on and off. In the end, I wished I'd purchased something smaller and less expensive."
2,Not long enough- Buy a Snoogle instead,"I bought a snoogle but when I saw the back n belly I thought wow that looks like a cloud or something.. boy what a disappointment. First off where you rest your head and put your hand under the head part it will GOUGE you in the shoulder, as mentioned in other reviews. 2nd its not long enough, like the snoogle. It barely goes down to your knees and its a battle to keep it there between your knees. The Snoogle wraps up between your legs, which is nice. The snoogle got lumpy after months of use BUT I am going to restuff it. Just go to Walmart or craftstore and buy pillow stuffing and restuff it. You can even hand sew it back together. Only takes an inch or so of open material.AND this is waaay too big. Takes up WAY over half my queen size bed. Poor husband:(I'll be sending this back."
4,Love it!,"This pillow is huge! No doubt about it. I'm 5""7 and 6 months pregnant, no matter how far I am from home, I drive the distance just to get back to my pillow. It takes up a whole queen size bed, so make sure you own a king if there is more than just you in bed."
2,Good concept but quickly loses support at head,"From my wife: ""I bought this pillow for my pregnancy and started using it at 5 months. The pillow is overall a good concept but has a few major problems. The support at the head started flattening after two weeks of use. For such a pricey product it would be nice to have better material as stuffing especially at the head. The other problem is the pillow case which is a project to put on. The side protrusions which are supposed to support the belly actually push on my belly - I am 5' 6"" and 133 lbs so not that big in my belly, maybe they work better for someone with a larger frame. In future I would just purchase two full body pillows and use my regular side-sleepers pillow for head support. Not worth the money, save it for a longer lasting product."""
3,Love it!,I love this pillow! I'm a belly sleeper by nature and this pillow has helped me sleep comfortably on my sides throughout my pregnancy. The only reason I'm not giving it 4 stars is that the seam right under the top portion really cuts into me. It isn't such a huge problem that I would consider returning it but you do have to work a little to find a position that's comfortable. It is a really big pillow. I have a California King bed and my husband has to push it over so he has room to sleep without the pillow on top of him.
3,just ok,"This was the first pregnancy pillow I have bought and honestly I think my 15 dollar body pillow from meijer works just as good. Kinda disappointed with the length, I feel scrunched."
3,A bit tight at top,"After spending two nights with pillow as is I found it was too tight at the top to get my arms in under the pillow, also it was a bit too bulky, but I like thin pillows for my head so that is personal preference. I cut the pillow at two places and removed some of the stuffing and resewed to have 3 seperate parts. Has been great now and very comfortable cheers"
4,Comfortable but too bulky,When I first got my maternity pillow.. I tried it out the first few nights and it was great. I slept good and my back didn't hurt anymore. The only issues I don't like about this pillow is that (1) it's too big for a Queen size bed; if you have a King..you'll probably be okay and (2) the side of the pillow sometimes dangles when I sleep and so my back ends up hurting because it loses the support. You really have to put the pillow more toward the middle of the bed to get the most of it but my poor husband is left with no room. It is really comfortable but maybe if you are serious about buying a pillow; find one that's less bulky and doesn't take much room. Good luck!
1,Didn't like it,I ordered the pillow after reading rave reviews - I found the pillow for me actually made my back pains worse. Haven't used it since the first week I ordered it - I keep it though since maybe when I get even bigger it may be of comfort to me. We'll see.
3,Despite weaknesses it gets the job done,I got this for my wife as just before her birthday we learned that she was expecting. While she says it does get the job done she keeps complaining about how hard the inseam is. I tried it out for myself and it dug into my skin. We're going to try loosening the seam but in the future we'll be sure to look for one that doesn't have an inseam.
1,Frustrtated with this pillow!!,"I purchased this pillow for my second pregnancy. My sister had loaned me a different maternity pillow for my first pregnancy and I loved it! I bought this one after all of the positive reviews thinking I couldn't go wrong. Yes, it does offer some support and cradles your body. However.... This pillow is way too over stuffed. Especially on the neck area. I have woken up with a stiff neck and headache two mornings in a row. I eventually ended up cutting the pillow open and removing A LOT of stuffing from the neck. Then had to sew it back up. In addition, the pillow case is THE WORST EVER! It is impossible to put back on- kind of ironic when this pillow is designed to make life more comfortable for a pregnant woman. It was so difficult (and frankly painful with my big belly!) that I saved it for my husband to do and it still took a good 15 minutes for him to figure it out. I would NOT buy this pillow again nor would I recommend it. Very disappointed."
5,Highly Recommend!,"I bought this pillow when I was just entering my second trimester. It has been a life (or should I say sleep) saver! I usually sleep on my back, so not being able to has been difficult, but this pillow has made the transition much easier! Spend the money girls! It's worth it!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS !!!!!!!!,"This is a terrible product and a terrible company .... Amazon is great but if you buy this here, and when (not if) it breaks, you are 100% out of luck. Farouk will ignore you. I just called them about my defective flat iron and they were nasty. I have had this for 7 months ... Be sure that whatever you buy it is not made by Farouk ... Others have had this same problem. I should have read them first .."
5,Good Product,This is a very good product for hair. It does not damage it as the other common flat irons. Also the shipping was excellent: very fast (3 days!!) and for free!
2,Meh...,"The CHI is an ok straightener. I live in Houston, Texas/New Orleans, Louisiana so I know what curly hair + humidity does, and the CHI does not solve the problem. If your hair is quite curly and you live in a humid area, I would suggest not buying it and going for the curly haired look, because chances are you won't find a straightener that will straighten your hair and keep it straight. When I use it anytime between March and October my hair starts to curl or frizz out bad after a hour or two of using it. Virtually pointless unless it's winter for me."
3,Works great when it works,"My wife purchased one of these to use at home , she was so happy with the results from it she bought one for my daughter , after about 9 months both of them starting having problems not heating up. I took both of them apart and the power cords were bad ,To a handy-man this might not sound like a big deal but it is, The cords are special and you can not purchase them separately , I have called several places and Looked on the internet and no body sells them ,You can send the unit in for repair but with the repair cost and shipping you will pay over $40 minimum to replace the cord, While looking on the internet for a cord ,I found a lot of people complaining about the cords going bad so quickly."
3,Flat Iron,Great tool if you know how to use it. I've had my hair dresser working with me to show me how to use it. It's taking time to learn to use it and get the kind of results I am looking for.
3,Great straightener,"The straightener was great but it did not make my daughter's hair 'shiny' as it claimed. Since she saw small kiosks at the local shopping malls where people actually sampled their straighteners and saw how some made her hair silky smooth as well as straight, we're going to the mall to buy one of those straighteners."
4,Great flat iron,"I bought this for my mom who just started straightening her hair. She has shoulder-length, fine, but frizzy hair. It works wonderfully for her. I have the 2 inch Chi iron and I love it for my own very naturally curly hair. If you have thick or long hair, I would suggest getting the larger model (2 inch). If your hair is think or short, the 1 inch should work just fine. These irons are much better than the ones you might buy in typical stores (Conair, Revlon, etc.). It also doesn't damage your hair as much because of the ceramic plates. You can also adjust the temperature which is nice."
1,"Good.....while it lasts, ugh!","I has my hair dresser order this for me off of ebay probably about 4 or 5 months ago. It always worked really good...I'm not going to say great because I never felt that it really did wonders for my hair like a lot of people hair. About 2 months into having it I started having problems where it wouldnt turn on, so I had to press the reset button on the plug but then it'd pop right back out so I had to do that several times till it would go on. Now, its pretty much dead. If you hold it a certain way it will heat up but its just not styling right. For the money I spent on it, it should have lasted me years, not 4 months! So now I dont know if I want to replace it or look for something else. It's just a big inconvenience because my hair is too short to put up so im stuck wearing it down so i need a good flat iron!Now after writing this review I've noticed many other complaints on here and other sites about it going bad quickly. Very annoying!!!!!!!"
5,Great Product,I love this product. It is just like the one my local stylist sales but at a reduced rate. I have thick curly hair and with this flat iron I end up with smooth silky straight hair! Just make sure you spray your hair with a protectant before you start.
4,Chi by Farouk,Love the product heats fast and works well. Extra long cord. Comfortable and light. Great price!
2,Terrible,The product worked great for about 5 months then the on/off switch went haywire and it quit working. I will never waste my money on another one.
5,GREAT PHONE OVERALL!,"I will just give you a brief overview.1. Great design and feels awesome.2. Easy to use.3. Good camera and has capability of taking pictures of yourself (like when the cell is closed).4. Poor video (but who really needs it)5. VERY good battery life.6. Excellent sound quality.7. Sometimes if volume is very high the person to whom you are speaking, they hear an echo because the speakers makes the sound and the sound goes back into the mic). Don't set volume all the way up.8. Top pick out of the t-mobile free phones."
1,Bad Phone along with Bad Service!!!!,"I have had this phone for 4 months now and it is a piece of junk! The battery life is short, the phone feezes, and the reception is horrible. Plus, now and then this phone drops calls. Anyone looking to buy this phone- beware! Looks can be decieving! Oh- and T-Mobile has bad customer service!!!"
2,not to great,"It looks great, but there are a few major problems with this phone.I have NEVER had this many dropped calls and I've had t-mobile for 2 years.The screen tends to freeze and you have to wait a few seconds to use it.The vibrate function is very weak."
2,Boring Game,Don't buy this game unless the only thing you like to do is kill people all the time and walk through the main characters flashbacks... defenitly don't buy!
3,it's a cover not a bag.,My husband loves this for his line 6 but when I purchased the item I was under the impression that it was a bag.
4,A very good album,"This BB album is often overlooked, but the live side/studio side offers two looks at BB's playing. As is always the case, BB's band smokes on the live cuts, and so does he. Great studio players on the studio side. An excellent album."
4,entertaining read,"Great action and likable characters, good love interest between black woman and wbite male in virginia, good villains who got what they deserved. Read it in one sitting."
5,"Commander in Chief - The Inaugural Edition, Part 2 (Episodes 11-18)",Received in time and in good condition
5,Just a quality show!!!,"Commander and Chief is ( Was ) one of those shows that you looked foward to every week, and I understand that it got dumped because it couldn't compete with American Idol ( Pleeezz!!!! ) There was another great show that got dumped for the same reason "" Love Monkey "", and the real shame of it is that American Idol is the most superficial, contribed, and mundane show on TV. All things being equal, I'd rather watch SPONGE-BOB !!!!!!!"
3,Class on Acid,This workout is great and of course works (as do all workouts when you stick to them)----but Whoever was behind the camera--shooting the footage of this Karate Fit class--What were they ThINKING?! Some of its sideways and random movements sometimes away from the instructor when shes saying something new...seriously...An inexperienced camera person would have a little more sense to keep the camera more still than what was done in this video.
2,MCDST?,"I thought military training manuals were dry and boring, this thing put me to sleep in 5 minutes. Another Micro$oft ploy to get more money out of people, especially people who want that certification. This is 1 of the many thousands of certifications that you can get from Micro$oft."
5,Ridiculously priced item,"There's no reason this book should be priced this high ($249). I hope nobody does business with this seller: BOOKSTORES12. This is a paperback book. It sells at CBD, Alibris and elsewhere for $79.00. And these are just two stores I picked at random. Even $79.00 is too pricey in my opinion. But $249 is absolutely absurd. Sellers like BOOKSTORES12 have encouraged me always to shop around before buying a book on Amazon. In many cases I can find far better deals.This is a great book by the way. It's probably got the most extensive collection of texts available in English translation. Copious notes to boot. Not bilingual though."
4,4 1/2 stars,See storyline above.Shannon's latest is a no nonsense fast-paced story sure to attract more fans. You get twists and turns as well as a fun ride through Vegas. A highly enjoyable novel.I have to question the authors knowledge about football in reference to one glaring mistake towards the end. Lets see who's keen enough to catch it.Highly recommended.
5,Beautiful glass ware,"Very pleased with my purchase. Well packed, arrived in perfect condition - Thank yhou"
3,Good Hardware for the money ...,"I just want to repeat this from the other review: DO NOT UNDER ANY CONDITIONS USE THE SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH THE CARD (for video capturing ), it's just a piece of junk. Try VirtualDub, it's free and have very good output."
3,Studio PCTV,"I've had this card for slightly over a year and it has stopped working. Before it broke, it was great for editing with Adobe Premiere, and especially for making online and CD films. I have used it a great deal, and while temperamental and irritating, it was a great value for a video editor and filmmaker. While my skill has far surpassed the quality of PCTV, it has excellent quality for the price. But, if you are looking to store your films on video after computer editing them, or you need something very reliable, don't get this. However, if you are a start-up filmmaker or just want to watch TV on your computer, this is an excellent product."
2,Useless support,"Farily nice picture, but you better hope it works for you because you will get no support at all. And you better be using Windows 98, because anything more recent isn't supported at all. The sound is extremely noisy and there is a lot of voodoo involved in making it work."
1,"Bad Hardware, Bad Support, Bad Value!","I bought this card a few months ago from Amazon, and it's now collecting dust in my closet. Pinnacle's support is useless, and their web site offers no real help. The software locks up Windows every time I run it, and I have tried it on several different PC's (Compaq and Gateway), with different versions of Windows (2000 and 98SE), all with no luck. Uninstalling and reinstalling has no effect, and Windows device manager reports no hardware conflicts. Too bad it doesn't report poorly designed hardware and software drivers. In this case, you get what you pay for. Spend a little more money and get a decent video capture card, don't make the same mistake I did."
4,Studio PCTV a Great Buy!,"Everything pretty much worked the first time through, but the included software for capturing is pretty basic.Doing TV viewing and video capture seems to work really well, though, once you get everything figured out... :)I'm running with a Celeron 466, 64 MB, and a Viper V770 Ultra, if that helps."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CARD!!!,"I bought this card and have regretted it ever since. I have installed this card on two machines, and it didn't work properly in either one. I have to manually assign IRQ numbers every time I reboot windows. When I tried to contact Pinnacle, they did not ever respond to my email. I will never buy something with Pinnacle's name on it again."
3,Power surge,"After comparing the majority of all laser printers, I picked the brother MFC2500 due to having a scanner and copier option along with the 12ppm performance of a printer. After receiving the printer and using it a couple of days, I learned that when in use the lights dimmed in the room of my office. This is the only problem that I expierenced, but enough of a problem to return. A good printer but the simple power surge has put me back on the trail of shopping."
2,"Confusion, when it comes to XSLT","I have to say that the first 5 chapters, served as a good introduction to XML. It was much much better than any Dummies book of the subject. Actually I found them to be treating the subject at some depth.But then came the most important chapters on XSLT & Programming Tools. It was completely confusing not because the subject was a tough one, but because the treatment was bad.I would have given 1 star had it been not for the first chapters."
3,thery ... too much of it...,"I've always enjoyed reading O'Reilly books specially those related to Linux/Unix and the open source community. I have the learning perl book and it's a great book but since some time now the O'Reilly books I'm buying are really deceiving me... and this is one of them... I'm starting to learn XML and beleive me I'm a computer freak but with this book I was relly lost... too few complete examples I mean they could at least show you after the first 50 pages a small complete example but nothing... just theroy and bla bla bla... ZZZzzz.... So I stoped reading this one and bought the ""beginning XML"" from wrox today and after reading the first 25 pages I understand much more about XML and what it can do for me so... hey it's your money do what you want with it... I'm going to read my book... happy new year ! ;)"
4,"Good material, unintentionally funny in places","I haven't finished the book as of yet, but so far it's clearly written with working examples to illustrate the concepts under discussion. As with most O'Reilly titles, the content is high-quality and well worth the time spent reading.I do wish to note that this line, beautifully rendered on my Kindle DX, imploded the irony meter: ""For reading long documents, there is no substitute for paper. Therefore, XML has had to embrace print."""
3,Perfume,"While I have been using this product for over 38 years, not only the bottle changed, but the product does not smell the same. I bought 3 since it is discontinued, and was very disappointed. Not exactly the same. I compared it to the bottle I have left, some in each arm and it is different. While before it was a 10 point star, now it is similar so only gets a 3 point star"
5,"A beautifully written, lyrical, evocative wonder of a book.","This is a beautifully written, gorgeous and wonderful book. I found myself surrounded by the inner lives of the three women and couldn't tear myself away from them during the few days it took me to read it. This is a book any woman can relate to, since we all lead lives with images of our mothers and grandmothers intertwining with our own existence, hopes, and dreams, as does KiKi. If you like Barbara Kingsolver or Sue Miller, you're going to love it."
3,How to contact the author?,"I have found some errors in this book. Does anyone know how to contact the author? I am rating the book three stars as ""Neutral""; when I finish going through the book I will give it an accurate rating and review.Errors so far:Page 78Section: Practice the New WordsB3 is gusto. Should be ""sabor""Section: Practice the Articles#11 is masculine/un/una. Should be masculaine/una/una.Page 79Section: Excersise (very bottom of page)#3 is vosotros. Should be vosotros AND vosotras.Page 80Section A under Practique las palabras nuevas#8 is delicioso. Should be delicioso AND deliciosa#18 is fresco. Should be fresco AND fresca."
4,Real Express Card under Vista RAID 1,"Works well although the install was a little difficult under Vista. Tech support is good but slow. You need to get the configuration GUI from SIG's web site (Works well although the install was a little difficult under Vista. Tech support is good but slow. [...]. But so far the card works well. I still need to test interrupted read/write. If that works I will give this a 5- for slow tech support although good. Watch out for any of these cards that only gives the Silicon Imaging Site for support. They don' provide any and their software doesn't work. If you get one of these, as opposed to an SIIG card, just send it back."
5,Great Organizer!,"Very happy with this expandable tray. It fit a large, odd-size drawer very well. My flatware is oversized and the spaces accommodate everything perfectly. There is plenty of room for everything I want in my flatware drawer, and keeps it well organized. Quality is good, definitely recommend."
3,Rainmaking is not a theoretical exercise,"This is a well written overview of what you should know to become a Rainmaker or deal with one. Unfortunately, it does not really tell you what to do today. It is strong on explaining the theory, which has great value, but short on practical applications. Since there are so few books that discuss this important area, even experts will find this book useful as an overview, but it is hard to use it as a guide book for practical action."
3,Good read for selling consumer products,"For sales that are not to complex this is an outstanding read covering the basics of lead generation and relationship building.Complex, highly contested sales need to be learned on the front lines."
2,Don't let the cover fool you,"Ok this cd I really felt gipped on...I saw the cover and they looked like a really heavy Psych group, and they really sounds liek a pre-British Invasion group, they did a few 4 season covers and those were good, but seeing the cover I was expecting more of a Psychedelic sound, but this is far from it. If you like Psych music I wouldn't recomend this. But it's and ok group for pre-beatle fans."
1,Do not buy,"I enjoyed using the CHI Turbo 2 inch flat iron. I have long curly hair and it worked great. But....it stopped working 4-5 months after I received it! It doesn't turn on. With the amount of money that is spent for this flat iron, it should work more than 4 months! Worse yet is their customer service fails to return messages. Terrible company and product. I am moving my business elsewhere and suggest you looking elsewhere."
5,"Chi Turbo 2""","I have very thick coarse curley hair and straightening is usually a joke. This 2"" Chi Turbo is the only iron I have found to do the job and have it last for over 24 hours. It makes my hair straight, shiney and manageable and I look more like a model than ever!!! I could do a commercial for this product! I find the 2"" great for my thick hair as I can do bigger sections in a shorter amount of time. I love the variable temp control and leave it right in the middle for perfect straight shiney hair every time. I also use the chi products for thermal protection since my coarse hair is also dry. You will be very satisfied buying this product and spending this amount of money. It is well worth taking great care of your hair if you use an iron. I love it and will never ever buy a different brand."
5,Great Product,This is the second Chi flat iron I have bought. I was so hooked on the 1 inch that I just had to get the larger 2 inch model. It is a time saver and so gentle on the hair. The adjustable tempurature gauge is a plus. I recommend this product to anyone in need of a flat iron. Don't waste your money on the cheaper versions from the drug stores---believe me the price is worth every penny!!
1,HIGHLY DISSAPOINTED,"I purchased this item,Farouk CHI GF1539 Turbo Big 2 Inch Ceramic Flat Iron Hair Straightenerand it worked well for a month or so. After that I started having problems with the straightener turning on. At times it wouldn't turn on at all and other times it would turn on for a few minutes and then turn back off. I didn't start giving me problems until after my ""return window"", go figure. Next time I will just buy my straightener from a salon or legitimate seller."
4,YAY!,"I love this straightener! It works wonders on my hair! I have really naturally curly hair and it usually takes about an hour to straighten my hair, now it only takes abot 20-30 minutes! i find that my hair is less damaged and the chi is so easy to use.. I am sooo happy. the supplier was also very prompt I recieved my order on the day that was expected and with no problems! thank you!"
2,did not work,"I bought this iron for my sister as a gift, had it sent to her and it did not work. Very disappointing."
4,OK - but....,"Nice box set, very god music, but a litle to much background noise in the remastering of the old numbers."
3,Testosterone Overdose,Now let's get this straight. This game is only about action and gun violence. Of course that's about all it's good for. The story's underdeveloped and poorly executed. The effects and action are top notch though. Techincal designs and all are really cool. The sound design sucks though. I mean SUCKS BADLY! It's worth a rent or at least as a good stress reducer.
1,Ultimate Knockouts.... More Like Ultimate Repeats,"I got this DVD for my BDay, and being a huge MMA/UFC fan I was really excited. Then I watched the DVD, and my excitement turned to sheer dissapointment. If you own Ultimate Knockouts 1 through 4, don't buy this DVD, all the fights are on prior knockout dvds. There are only two new fights on this DVD that aren't on the others, Vera vs. ""Some Guy"" and Couture vs. Liddell 3. Nothing else is new, there is no Gonzaga vs. Cro Cop, nothing past 2005. I am beyond disappointed."
1,Nothing New,"Don't buy this item if you are expecting a new knockout video, that is what i did and it was a big mistake. As a big UFC fan I buy all the knockout videos and have never regretted it until this one. This video is the same knockouts that are in Ultimate Knockouts volume 1,2,3 that i already own."
1,Garbage..,"Like the other reviews have stated, its repetitive. A couple knockouts taken from the ultimate series 1-3 and then they decided to throw in about 20 minutes of garbage stoppages. if your going to have a dvd that is the ultimate ultimate knockouts, you at least better have the silva/belfort knockout. the last 15 minutes is fights that arent even knockouts; they are long, drawn out stoppages by low level fighters. Dont buy this dvd if your looking for something new in the series or if you think its a greatest hits compilation cuz its not."
4,Huge MMA Fan!!!!,"If you love MMA, you'll love this dvd, my wife got it for me as a gift & I loved it. Its just ko after ko after ko. Only down side was that toward the last maybe 3 fights they were longer into the rounds, but well worth the watch for any fan!!!"
5,Excellent Salad Bowl Set,"The Wooden Salad Bowl Set appeared to be top quality in the advertisement. After it arrived the Set was even better than expected, it is a top quality product which gives others the impression that this Salad Set cost $200 or more. Looking forward to years of good use."
1,Never got it working,"Even with support from HP, I never could get this thing to work. Waste of money. Get the Sony DVDirect."
1,No response or action,Not pleased. Returned the earrings two weeks ago Fedex at my expense and have yet to hear from them. Noticed I'm not the first with same problem (back came off pearl).
4,The Best Summary of Anarchist Though I've Encountered,"Daniel Guerin's book is the best summary of the writings of early anarchist political theory that I've ever read. The only drawbacks are a failure to provide citations for the sources quoted and of course its age. Having been published in the 1970's it is in serious need of an update to include the writings of Bookchin, Zerzan, Black and Chomsky just to name a few. But with those quibbles aside this could and should be a textbook for either organized classroom study of anarchist history and thought or an excellent resource for the autodidact. I recommend it highly."
3,Technical but interesting,"Though this was a required text for school, I find myself reading it weeks after finals. It assumes a basic knowledge of Architecture & isn't for the casual reader, but there's much good information to be had. Tends to make me want to travel to the places mentioned."
3,Okay,"I have had this perfume for 2 years. It has a nice scent but is on the strong side. If you purchase this, consider purchasing a smaller size."
1,Poor return policy.NO refund,Unfortunately my wife did not like the fragrance and was told to return product. However we have yet to be credited or notified in anyway that they received and are processing our refund.Buyers beware
4,Give him shock treatment,Really funny. I never heard of anyone having a car accident inside of a car wash.
1,Such a waste.......,"(This book reminded me of Hubert Selby's ""The Demon"" - same narrative, similar story line of a messed up individual!) There are some AWESOME glimpses into the Ramones, but a majority of the book is listening to Dee Dee complain, whine, blame, etc. I tore out the pictures, and threw the book out - I knew I wouldn't ever want to read it again."
5,Read it!,"If you are a Ramones fan, you have to read this book. Yes, at times Dee Dee whines. Yes, he heaps dirt on his bandmates. Yes, he talks too much about drugs. But it's a book that was clearly written from the gut, with no censorship or repression-after I finished reading it, I felt as if I'd spent an afternoon talking to Dee Dee. And also, it gives you hope that you, too, can make it, no matter how low you are. It's not just a book by a member of one of the best bands ever-it's a man's feelings and thoughts poured into paper."
2,not a bad try!,"not too bad look at a great era, even better is ""High On Rebellion: Inside the Underground At Max's Kansas City"" by Yvonne Sewell Ruskin, loaded with NY Dolls/Johnny Thunders,Psychotic Frogs,Jayne County, Cherry Vanilla, etc THE REAL SCENE! YEAH!"
5,Great Opera for Young Audiences,"I love opera but have been hesitant to introduce it to my daughter due to the mature subject matter of many Met productions. La Cenerentola was the perfect choice for viewing by my 8 year old. She's hooked!! Right now she's watching the DVD La Cenerentola for the 2nd time and loving it! The cast is wonderful, the story lines are interesting, and the scenes move quickly enough to keep the youngest of viewers entertained. The only thing that I would warn about is that the labeling on my DVDs is backwards. Disk 2 is labeled as Disk 1 and vice versa. Also, the DVD does not automatically set the subtitles so you'll need to add the english subtitles each time you play the DVD. I consider that to be a small price to pay for a well done production. Bravo!!!"
3,Pretty decent 3 1/2 stars,"This movie had some great MMA fight scenes. Some of the personal themes were like Karate Kid and Rocky, but besides that it was good and intense. The antagonist is awesome, you want to really hate him. He is James (CAM)from Twilight and he has a black belt in Krav Maga."
3,Never back down,"This was a pretty good the story a little bit cheesy but better then other similar movies. This is about a man who let his father drive while drunk and the father dies while driving back home with his son. The son manages to survive but is all in regret about allowing his father to drive. He gets into a fight while playing football and is moving to Orlando, FL where he starts in another school and the story begins."
5,Great Action/Fighting Movie,"If you love action and fighting movies, this is a great movie. Its got a very good storyline too. I thought the second one was better so if you like this one definetly watch the sequel."
4,"Good movie, good service","It came a couple of days before it said it would, which is good because it was a Christmas present."
3,Sounds like a remake,I haven't seen this movie but gave it 3 stars because it sounds like the director stole the premise of the movie from an old movie with Billy Blanks called showdown that I saw on TV a while back.
5,Way better than expected !,"Awesome movie , great acting , great fighting and a decent story. Djimon Hounsou and Sean Faris give a great performance. It's like Karate Kid but way less lame. I thought I would hate this movie but it has a good message, and just totally rocks. Also , Since Spider Man is now being rebooted , I'd like to say that Sean Faris should be the next Spider Man. And does anyone else think he kinda looks like a young Tom Cruise?"
5,great product,"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."
2,Stylish junk,"The previews for this movie looked much better than the movie actually is. This had a very stupid plot. A high schooler (who looks like he's been out of high school for about 10 years now) moves to a new city where everybody seems to be obsessed with mixed martial arts. And everybody is stinking rich. He goes to a friend's house/mansion where there is a party with naked girls making out and a fight club in the back yard. And because he punched somebody one time, he's now forced to fight the Brad Pitt wannabe of the school.Oh, and random people in traffic will threaten to run you off the road for being stopped at a stop sign and then try to beat you up. But you wont have any of that cuz you got mad skills.Whatever. The Karate Kid this is not. Some of the fights are shot well, but all of the characters are poorly written and poorly acted."
1,Is this a joke?,"A movie about white trash people living in the ghettos is intended for just that. I couldn't understand how this even relates to anything in the real world. Then again, I've never been to the ghettos of America. Save your money, interested buyers. That's the least you can do."
1,"For god's sake, don't commit.","Bit of a tedious read. Mostly obvious. Very cautious and circumspect at times. It could be a feel good book for those afraid to enter the bleak world of abstinence but its not. Heather's new book might be titled: ""Smoke one cigarette a day in relative safety""."
2,Pocket Street does not provide turn by turn directions,"Streets and Trips does not provide active turn by turn directions. This package simply provides where you are when the GPS is active. Streets and Trips does provide directions to a given location; however, Pocket Streets and Trips does not provide this functionality.I recommend that you buy the Pharos bundle that contains the Ostia software. Ostia provides turn by turn directions as well as voice and audio prompts.BTW, I have 2 Dell Latitudes that suffer from the TI PCMCIA chipset. Has anyone figured out how to make this device work with the TI chipset? Pharos tech support is aware of this problem and have no solutions to date. Bob Baker, Pharos, and I await your answer to this question."
2,Incompatability Issues,"This should really be added to the description of the product, to ensure people don't buy it unknowingly withouth knowing about the well-known incompatability issues. I have spoken to Pharos Customer Support on the phone, and they confirm that this PCMCIA GPS Receiver is incompatible with Texas Instruments and O2 Micro PCMCIA Cardbus Readers.You can find out what you have by right clicking on ""My Computer"", click Properties, go to the Hardware Tab, click Device Manager and Expand ""PCMCIA adapters"". There it will show who manufactures your PCMCIA Cardbus Controller. If it's TI or O2, this GPS Receiver most likely won't work with your laptop.Good luck!"
2,too brief,"i'm using this book for my neuro course, and it's just too brief! i think the author's other book, the board review series, would probably be better for really learning this subject"
4,Dope Deal,This book is about a man selling dope and got caught.He was sleeping one day and police broke in his house.He got raided. He went to jail but his dad bailed him out.I like this book because this book is intresting.
1,Very Poor Photo Printing,"Bottom line: does a poor job of printing photo's. Tried the help desk, but they knew little more than me.I wanted to like this program. It's the only one that I could find that would allow me to print the inside of a card and then the outside. That would negate the need to feed a printed photo back through my printer to print the inside. I have a 2ghz Dell and a Canon S820 printer which does a great job printing photo's.I inserted a high res photo into my card. The print out was very grainy. I tried lightening the photo and it helped a little. I then printed the same photo OUTSIDE of Print Shop and it looked great Obviously the problem is within Print Shop. I sent it back. I can't believe it would print photo's so bad, but it did."
5,LifeSavers Pep O Mint,"Since I can no longer find this item in stores locally, I turned to [...]. I am on a low-carb diet and Pep O Mints are literally a Life Saver! Very few carbs allow me to use them to curb hunger, when I have a dry mouth prior to singing, and when allergies are causing a dry cough. I never leave home without a roll which is handy for the theatre, symphony, church or any time I'm in the car or on the go. Amazon is easy to use, I always receive my products in a very short time and I have always been pleased with my purchases. Many thanks."
3,The Book of Pirates by michael hague,"condition fine, save your money and order Howard Pyle's Book of Pirates"
3,Good for light use,"I bought this kit to put together in my basement to provide an enclosure for my growing orchid collection. It was easy for me to put up by myself, if a little awkward in places. I did not buy the custom cover, but used several rolls of window insulation plastic (which came out almost as expensive anyway!).I did have an issue with some screw holes not being present in a few of the plastic parts as indicated in the plans, but these were parts that hold together just fine under their own weight. I did not use any side bracing that is optional with the plans as it is in a basement. However if you wanted this to be outside, you'd definitely need the extra bracing to ensure it stayed standing under winds."
1,"Like the Movie, Hate the Print","This is a great movie, but a cheaply made DVD. The sound track poor, just listen to the music during the beginning credits. Also, while the movie is the original 1.66:1 it is put into standard definition dimensions. That is to say, when played on a widescreen TV you have the film letter boxed all the way around. This is unusual in this day and age. Yes you can expand it, if you don't mind a distorted picture, which I hate. This movie DESERVES BETTER TREATMENT! And Amazon should do a better job of describing what you are REALLY getting."
1,Self-Hatred Personified,"I feel sorry for Debra Dickerson. I looked forward to reading the story of an accomplished African-American woman who grew up in the same era as I. What I found was the clearest example of self-hatred that I have ever read. From her writing style with her use of words as a weapon to batter those deemed less worthy than she (which seems to include every Black person walking) to her abuse of alcohol, she experiences a self-made isolation because no one is good enough. She defines self-inflicted racism.I found her story completely uninteresting with the exception of when she wrote about her brother, Bobby. I pity Debra Dickerson. There is so much value to be gained from interaction with others whether or not we share the same backgrounds and beliefs. Ms. Dickerson is far too self-involved to appreciate the beauty and spirit of her black heritage."
4,A strongly told American Tale,This memoir isn't going to be easy for everyone to take but strong medicine is sometimes the best for you. Dickerson refuses to toe either party's line as she grapples with some of the thorniest issues of race and class affecting the country today. She's not going to win any awards for charm--as she admits herself--but you can't help but be impressed by her honesty and rigor. Is it a perfect memoir? No. But it's a book that serious readers should take seriously--and are likely to be impressed by.
2,Having Problems with DVD A120,"I just bought A-120 Panasonic DVD player. When I was watching the Matrix and started using the features that was with the movie (e.g. special features which allowed you to jump from one scene to the other), it(DVD player) started freezing on me. It stopped reading the DVD record. I had to turn it on and off. This solved the problem but after watching two or more DVD movies, the problem started again giving me a message that a wrong disc was inserted. Anybody else having the same kind of problem? I really enjoyed this player until it started giving me this problem. any comments?"
4,Great quality product,"I have been very happy with this Panasonice DVD player. The discs load very quickly, the remote is easy to use. The picture is absolutely perfect. The quality rivals DBS systems. The only thing missing is a time remaining feature to show you how much of the movie is remaining."
5,Super Easy,"This is a wonderful DVD player. I consulted the directions only once for like 5 seconds to make sure how to hook it up to the TV. After that, I just popped in a DVD and it was pretty easy from there. The remote is real easy to understand. It doesn't have a bunch of unnecessary buttons like one of those Toshiba DVD players.The only extra thing you need to buy is a cord to hook it up to the TV. But that's not a big deal. I went to Sears and got a cord for under $10. You can get an S-Video cable or the cable with the red, yellow, and white things on each end (I got the multi-color one).Other than that, this is a great DVD player. Just make sure your TV is the right holes in the back. Mine didn't so I had to set it up at my friends house (it sucks being a poor college kid)."
5,"great player, great price.",if you are looking for a dvd player this is it. great player for great price. it have all the output and input needed for a great home theatre. i would highly recommend this player over other high price one. the key to a good home theatre is the reciever. get the one with built-in decoder and you have it made. i enjoy my player very much.
1,Decent for shorter movies,"I purchased this player in March and had no problems until I tried to watch a movie that lasts more than 2.5 hours. It seems that the Panasonic has some problems switching between layers on the DVD, causing a great deal of digital noise, both in the video and the audio. This is not apparent during the first and last few chapters of a longer movie, but when the laser tries to switch to the second layer in the middle of the movie, it just doesn't cut it. If your favorite movies run between 90 and 120 minutes, by all means, this is a good player. But to watch a movie that is any longer, I often resort to my PC's SONY DVD drive, which has no problem. It may in fact be that DVD players haven't been standardized yet, leaving those of us who prefer digital to expend more money to fix (or replace) the problem. My advice: RENT a number of players first, and try them out at home with longer movies before making a decision."
2,Do your homework before you buy,"I bought the A120 2 months ago and already, after only playing about a dozen DVDs, there are problems. It appears that my A120 has problems reading the second layer of a ""dual"" layer DVD. After doing some reading and talking with a lot of friends, most DVD players have problems. With some Sony products, the video and audio are out of sync! I wonder why this type of information does not appear in Consumer Reports? Do your homework! I like Panasonic but DVD is far from being defect free."
1,What a Waste,"This is the worst movie I had ever watched in my entire life. The plot was so poor as well as the actions. The filmed was poorly made and I believe back in 1996, there were quality movies have been made but this does not qualify a bit to be one. Where is Tony by the way ! Zombies in the jungle, tribemen and rebel-like soldiers,,,wow what a waste. I can say the budget was about 10-25K US$ or maybe less. Where can you find a golden stone treasure that even the King of Jordan and Prince of Saudi would like to buy it for 1B US$ which only lies beside the riverbank where the rebels live. One more, an almost hundred rebel soldier attacked by 2-3 good guys and yet the explosion is everwhere as if they were attacked by vietcongs..Those who are fan of Tony Jaa, never ever try renting, buying or even watching this movie. The cover was deceptively made to fool the consumers. Too dark, too slow, extremely poor movie. ZERO rating for me."
2,But I slept,"I expected this film to be about more insider trading, but instead we have Michael Douglas making a speech about dishonesty. He's selling his book, of course. Coming out of prison, he appeared as if he'd been to a hair stylist. His acting, as usual, is pathetic. He plays Michael Douglas.The screen play was boring; I fell asleep during the first 20 minutes. Needless to say, I didn't see the ending. The Wall Street people are callous, and true to script, don't care. Neither did I. It would be preferable to cast believable people, and do away with perfect young wives, and perfect, young MBA types who are masters of the Universe. As we all know, these blow hards almost brought us to financial Armageddon."
3,good acting but sadly the storyline weakens as movie progresses,"the film is average but not riveting. the storyline starts off very well then becomes increasingly unrealistic. in summary, the film fails to make each characters' motivations believable and hence does not create a strong level of empathy with me as a viewer of this film. for example - when shia's character realises his fiance has a 100m in a swiss bank account, his sole aim is to use the money to invest it into the fusion company. I find this very hard to believe given the context of the situation at that point in the film."
3,Good but not Great,This movie needed a little more action and less talk. It gets a B- or 3 stars I give it and A had it shown some clips of Mr. Gordon in prison life and what he learned. And maybe expan on what happen to Mr. Gordon family in more detail such as his son OD and were did the wife go?As stated this kinda movie you can watch more than once and also buy or rent and feel like Mr. Gordon paid his dues and once again became a human being.
1,Rambling,This movie was terrible. It was all over the place and none of it was deep enough to immerse the viewer.Your time would be infinitely better spent simply watching a documentary on cable tv about any random greedy person. The tv show American Greed with commercials is a far better viewing experience.
2,BORING,"I watched the 1st one with Charlie Sheen and it has me glued to the TV. I am a huge fan a Shia Lebouf. I think he is an excellant actor. This movie seemed like it was slopped together to make a quick buck. First off Shias character and his girlfriend played by Carey Mulligan didnt make sense. He is a broker and his whole career is based off money and making it. She however, hates money and works for a non profit orginaztion and it very uncomfortable with have any money. Why are they together? Didnt seem like they matched as a couple. Plus her whininess throughout the movie bugged me. The acting by Shia and Michael was great. However, there were a lot of stories going on with no substance at all. Already an hour in the movie I asked my husband if this movie seems to be going anywhere. To me the movie was a lazy attempt to captalize on a classic. If you have seen the first wall street do not see money never sleeps. Doesnt even compare!"
2,Terrible,"I was waiting over three years for this movie to come out and to my surprise it was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. I absolutely loved the first Wall Street and have seen it at least 30 times so I presumed that the sequel would be as good if not better. Well I hate to say it but I almost walked out of the theater about half way through the film.The acting was bad the storyline even worst so I'm not sure what Oliver Stone was thinking when making this film.My opinion is that he was better off not doing this sequel and leaving his mark as creating the best trading movie of all-time. Now he can go down in history as creating the best and now the worst trading films of all-time.Cheers,JT"
1,Awful!,I dont understand how this is a follow up to the original Wall Street. They didn't even choose an interesting plot or story. They could have done amazing things with this movie - feeding on the myths of high finance - but instead they ruined it. ack!
2,Mediocrity Never Sleeps,"A belated and disappointing sequel to ""Wall Street"" (1987) directed by that master of subtlety, Oliver Stone. After a 23-year absence, Michael Douglas' return to his Oscar-winning role of Gordon Gekko is botched in this lame melodrama. Instead of going for the financial jugular, the ham-handed Stone pulls his punches - working with an appallingly weak script by Allan Loeb and Stephen Schiff. The proceedings are further marred by the stunning nonentity known as Shia LaBeouf, who brings nothing to the party. Douglas and a mostly fine cast easily outshine LaBeouf, but cannot reverse Stone's cinematic decline. Little wonder that ""Money Never Sleeps"" arrived in video stores less than three months after its theatrical release."
5,Great movie,I loved the movie...I thought everything worked in perfect harmony except for Carey Mulligan. She should not have been in this movie. She was completely dull and obsolete. A better actress could have made this movie more convincing!
2,"GREED IS GOOD, EXCEPT WHEN IT COMES TO THIS GREEDY SEQUEL!","The original 'Wall Street' was a very successful and entertaining film. Michael Douglas even won an Oscar for his magnetic portrayal of the ruthless and unethical Gordon Gekko. Oliver Stone starts here with a decent idea, but the film lacks the style and conviction that made the original so great(in its time). There is too much time spent revisiting the past with an awkward cameo by Charlie Sheen and regurgitated dialogue from the first film. The uninspired script makes this one tedious for the most part and it makes this film seem too long. Even Gekko's speech seems like a flighty montage of the original. It does have a few good points, but its shortcomings make it one I won't be revisiting any time soon."
3,Hmmm,"So the girlfriend lives in this ridiculous penthouse with views all over Manhattan, but ""doesn't care at all about money"". Then, in like the first minute, they ""establish"" the Shia LaBeef character as being solidly liberal by just coming out and saying it. So for the rest of the movie, we know where we stand: people who love to have their cake and eat it too: über-capitalist materialists who hate capitalism and materialism. Welcome to modern New York City.Also, I do think that the movie has its good and its strengths, but was it just me who noticed that the girlfriend jettisons the Shia at the first sign of trouble, but then demands that others not be selfish, etc.Hypocrites !"
4,The Christmas Miracle,"Gave to a friend for Christmas. They enjoyed it and said it was a good movie. I have not viewed it yet, but our interests are the same, so would take their word for it being a good movie."
2,Please review the book in a bookstore before buying,"I would highly recommend you review this book in a bookstore before buying.This book is very short summary of common christian thought (book is rather small and is printed in the large type font that junior high books are printed in).Reading the book is very much like talking to a true believer who loves God with his heart. Potentially good for those who are unfamilar with Christian beliefs.However if you are a believer and you tend towards loving God with your mind more than your heart, then this book may be disappointing. While I believe in many of the ideas presented in the book, I found the author's particular defense of those ideas weak and sometimes the author would state common Christian beliefs without providing any evidence.I am not meaning to discourage the author nor those who might find this book useful, but those who are in looking for more indepth explanations of the Trinity or Christ should thumb through the book before purchasing."
2,"Safety yellow, not orange neon","I hoped the color on the picture was off when I ordered these.They are safety yellow, like the yellow on traffic warning signs (curve ahead, etc.).I needed orange neon. I'll live with these for now, but they are definitely not ORANGE."
3,Well made sequal to vampire classic!,"If you loved ""Count Yorga, Vampire"", be sure to get a copy of the follow-up, ""Return of Count Yorga"". Although it also is a lower budget horror flick it has some truly great moments. The very good perfomance of a hearing-impaired teacher as well as her character's treatment by the authorities in the film also deserves mention. The deaf character in the movie is not considered a reliable witness by the police when reporting the brutal murder of her friends at the hands of the vampires. Craig T. Nelson is very young and handsome playing one of the cops in an early role. He fails to understand how a series of dissapearances could be linked to the vampire played once again (very well!) by Robert Quarry. Robert Quarry is both suave and chilling. As the film progresses they both get the point, except Nelson gets two of them!! Leave the lights on and don't forget the popcorn!"
4,COUNT YORGA IS A BAD ...!!!,"Robert Quarry reprises his best role as Count Yorga.This time,he is after a beautiful woman who works at an orphanage.Count Yorga has his horde of vampires kill her familly,then kidnaps her.Roger Perry returns,but is playing a different character.He is now playing the fiance of the kidnapped woman.When he convinces the police that Count Yorga is to blame,they go to his big mansion and another terror filled romp ensues,as they find there's no way out.Watch when a preist tries to distract Count Yorga from noticing the police break in.Count Yorga sees through him and leads him to his death.It was hysterical how the preist reacted to this.Another hysterical scene,was Count Yorga's slo-mo run towards his victim.He can't say he didn't see him comming.Another weird ending.This one is more scarrier then the first."
2,"Again, Hollywood Proves the Sequel is Worse than the 1st.","The 1st one was bad enough. I don't know how it made enough mone to earn a sequel but Hollywood thought it did. THis one is even worse than the 1st. Yorga returns, mysteriously sine he was thoroughly killed in the 1st, but know he's taken up residence in an orphanage to continue his winning and killing ways.The effects are gory, fot the time, and unnecessarily so. The character Yorga is neither sympathetic nor magnetic, like Lee's protrayal of Dracula.Save yourself the money and time. DOn't get this one."
3,Very Disappointing,"I love Ellington... and I have about 20 CDs of his music. This set is only one which is a disappointment.Disk 1 is the best of the three, and features some interesting stuff.Disk 2 has recorded comments by Ellington. These are a one-sided conversation: the idea is that a local DJ would ask a question, and then run the recording of Ellington answering, simulating a conversation which never actually took place. It's kinda creepy. The 'interviews' are interspersed with music. Ellington's band plays with the Boston Pops, and its by far the worst, most square music Ellington ever recorded.Disc 3 is a bit better, semi-kitschy arrangements of non-Ellington tunes recorded for Reader's Digest. Some interesting stuff, but not as good as Ellington's original tunes."
2,"Big on top, small on the bottom","If you have been searching for a 14"" skillet you no doubt have found that they are big on the top but not so on the bottom; many have a bottom diameter of only 10.5"". I contacted Nordic Ware and they told me their 14"" skillet has a bottom diameter of 11"", bigger than most but not much larger than that of a normal 12"" skillet."
4,Another Great Eastern Developments Release,This album is a great 'bread and butter' album. This is the kind of stuff that keeps my life going. More beautiful music from Scott Herron's (not the Gil) superior record label. http://www.easterndevelopments.com
1,Do not buy this JUNK,It worked for 2 months (used 5-6 times) and then broke. I had bought it for $4 however it did not last even for 4 months. I think it is absolute junk. please do not waste your money.
2,Cheap is as cheap does,"I purchased this mostly because it was cheaper than many alternatives that I could find, and I found that I got what I paid for. The charger lasted for about a week before the plastic casing around the part you plug into the lighter split in half. It worked for a little bit longer with some tape around it and then just stopped working. I say spend some more money and get something that will last much longer."
1,Horrible,Arrived in the mail broken. Cheap cheap cheap. doesn't fit correctly and is clearly not produced very well. Spend 3-5 more bucks and get something worth your time and money..not this garbage.
1,"Cheap Plastic - Bad Quality, Don't buy",This product quality is really really bad. I regret spending even $2 on this product.
1,piece of junk.,It's great it only cost $5 and some change but I used it twice and the piece that connects to your iPod just fell off. Waste of time and money.
5,great,This fits with IPod and Iphone 3G and Iphone 4. So dont waste money on separate items. So far it is working great and no complaints at all.
3,"Plug is really wide, prevents car stereo cord from connecting","It's ok but it kind of scares me because it gets really warm while charging. I bought it to use with my iPod Touch and the biggest problem is that the plug is so wide that I can only plug in a very narrow/small plug into the headphone jack while it is plugged into the charger. I wanted to use this in my car, but the plug that I use to connect to my stereo is too big so I cannot connect both charger and stereo cord at the same time.Only thing I've found that is small enuf to plug in while on this charger is the apple headphones - they have a super small plug. Anything else - other cords, stereo connectors, other brand of headphones - will probably be too big."
5,MOST COMPREHENSIVE DOG CARE BOOK EVER WRITTEN,"NO ONE BOOK CAN CONTAIN THE SUM TOTAL OF KNOWLEDGE ON A PARTICULAR SUBJECT BUT THIS ONE COMES CLOSE. FROM IP6 TO ACCUPUNCTURE, TO HERBAL REMEDIES, IT COVERS IT ALL. WRITTEN IN CONCISE EASY TO UNDERSTAND LANGUAGE IT IS A TREMENDOUS RESOURSE, FOR THE PET OWNER CONCERNED WITH THE OVERMEDICATION OF HIS OR HER PETS. ALTERNATIVES TO WESTERN TRADITIONAL MEDICINE CAN BE AS VALID FOR OUR PETS, AS THEY CAN BE FOR OURSELVES. THE WRITER USES A VERY REASONED COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO PET HEALTH CARE. I, FOR ONE, AM LOOKING FOR THE AUTHOR'S SECOND & FOLLOWUP BOOK ON THE SUBJECT."
1,Go Royal,I Had this register for just about one year before I threw it out of the third story window. The register tape starter failing after 3 months and then it got so bad I had to get rid of it for another of the $99 Royal brand that I had for the first 12 years I owned a business. I am so glad I never got around to logging in all my products and SKU numbers on this PoS.
1,Worst editing ever,"After really enjoying Richard Hatch's first two books in this series, I was surprised at how terrible this book was. I have never seen a book edited this poorly. On top of that, many of the plots from the first two books were dropped, or took off at 90 degree angles for no reason. No good reasons (or any reason at all) were given for the changes. Perhaps it was all the fault of the new coauthor. If so, Mr. Hatch needs to do a better job of previewing what he attaches his name too."
3,Pretty Good for a sequel,Gate one was a great movie..a cult favorite of mine...This sequel Gate IIalthough not as good is definitely worth buying..I have watched it twice and have enjoyed it each time...Characters are cool..has an upbeat ending and i recommend watching it with friends...
1,Not as Advertised,"Just a quick note to buyers that the item description is in not accurate. These dragon lamps do not take a 75 watt bulb, in fact they only take a 7 watt night light. So they can not be used to read or light a room. The dragon artwork is nice but I can not use them as I intended because of misleading descprition."
5,anklet,"i adore the heartsy stuff, and the sort of ""S"" design the curve in the middle, im planning to give this as a valentines present for my loved one.. better be early than sorry!"
2,Forget about it.,This isn't the book I thought it would be. Too detailed when details weren't needed...and too basic when details would have been helpful. There are better books out there.
2,No outlines please!,"This book is full of partial knowledge. It is a good outline to catapult your memory, but it is not good for learning the material the first time around. It is boring."
1,unable to review,Please see next review. The box arrived without the book-it had to be reordered! Thanx
4,"Samsung 955DF 19""",For the money I paid for it I was pleasantly surprised color is very good. Only downside is menu in front of the set which is somewhat difficult to operate in expaning picture to all four corners
2,hand-held solitaire game,This game was much smaller than I anticipated so I returned it..when I typed in description I was looking for a big screen game..this was far from it!
2,"loose latch, belt clip breaks easily",Same comments on the latch opening easily.My complaint about the belt clip - it is made of inexpensive plastic and broke off after two days mild use. Wouldn't buy again.
2,Good case if you don't wear it on your belt,"Originally, I purchased this heavy-duty case to protect my new expensive 8525. However, wearing the case on my belt with the belt clip, my phone fell out of the case several times when the case cover accidentally opened up. Luckily the phone was not functionally damaged, but I have several big dents and scratches on the case. I'm going to stop using a case now, since the phone is now already beat-up.The latch mechanism for the cover will loosen up with use, especially since you'll have to open and close it repeatedly to access the touch screen. Also, it took a bit getting used to, to have to open the case to make a phone call.The overall quality of this case is very good tho, because it fits the phone very snuggly and the holes line up to all the buttons.I guess its a great case if you don't wear it on your belt. But I can't justify such a huge case if I carry it in my pocket."
1,Not for the Cingular 8525.,I bought this for my new Cingular 8525. The phone will technically fit in the case but the side buttons are not accessible and get mashed when I put the phone in the case. Apparently the case is for a previous model phone. Bad purchase.
5,My son's favorite book,"My 21 month old son loves this book!! We read it every night at bedtime. He loves to point out the things we are talking about (moon buggies, astronauts, planet earth). He gets excited thinking about what is coming up on the next page. While we are having such a great time he is learning about space travel. I highly recommend it!"
5,Great first space book,"Just got this book the other day for my three year old son. I am giving it to him on his birthday next week with the Rocket Ship I also bought for him. This book is perfect for explaining space travel and the moon to a toddler. Simple language, awesome illustrations with both cartoons and actual space/moon images."
2,Dye lots were different - towels did not match even after washing,Dye lots were different. Towels do not match even after washing. The base cream color of the towel did not match
5,Barbie is still Barbie,"I bought this used game for my younger granddaughter, since the new ones are very expensive for a passing amusement. It worked fine, and she loved playing with it. The only cautionary tale is that a companion game wouldn't run on Windows XP SP2, but would only run on a much older computer, so you really are taking a chance with an older used computer game, even from a major company."
2,"Not true black, more grey.","I ordered this item in lieu of the typical dark green files. I had hoped for true black and they are basically a grey/green color similar to the dark green files. I wouldn't re-order, they were kind of expensive."
1,Misleading,"Misleading - product name states ""Colored"" hanging folders. Once you view the specifications more closely you see the color is only ""black"". And that is exactly what came - just black hanging folders. Not happy."
3,Only a few tabs,I wonder just how much money this company is saving by not including enough plastic tabs for the folders. Perhaps they'll end up saving nothing if enough customers wise up to their dishonesty.I noticed a far better price on a similar product at my local wholesale shopping club.
2,Excellent Purchase,"Thank You for the c.d. in great condition. We had fast service and would gladly do business with you again. Thanks again, N and L C."
3,Good but too fast paced,I liked the book but it went too fast for my liking. I wanted to know more about Shaelyn and her thoughts when she was thrown back in time. The book seeemed to have her take it in stride. She should have been frantic. This book is a must for all time travel fans. I will be reading more of this author's books in the future.
5,Phenonenal,"This book was well written. It is one of the best books that I have ever read. I have read many time travel romances....but this one takes the cake!! (in a manner of speaking). Shaelyn was a marvelous and vivacious character. Alec is probably the man that I am destined to marry. That is if I can take him away from Shae. If you enjoy this book, check out the sequel ""River of Dreams"". If this book wasn't rated on a 1 to 5 scale, I would have given it a 10+!!"
5,awsome,"Over the years, I have learned not to waste any of my hard earned money on any power tool thats not a Bosch. They are quite, powerful, smooth and dont get hot!!!"
2,Let down,"The biggest disappointment with this drill is that it won't charge below 32 deg F, pretty major setback for winter work that I've never seen on any other model, and I've used many. Where other chargers blast the battery with juice until it heats up enough to accept a charge Bosch just shows a red error light. Even when I brought it inside and it finally warmed above freezing it only trickle charged at cold temps taking hours to fill. I called Bosch and they said that the Litheons are the same way so I returned mine and ordered a NiMh of a different brand, more amp hours and maybe I'll actually be able to use this one. Also the softer break ""durashield"" housing is more prone to scratches and won't help you anyway if you drop it on the cheesy plastic chuck my model came with."
5,"Great wax. Follow directions, put on very thin coat, use microfiber.","A fine wax. The directions tell you to apply the wax to the whole car and then wipe the wax off with either a microfiber or cotton terry cloth. I first tried it with terry cloth, and it was okay, but I'm going out today to buy a microfiber cloth for it. Be sure to let it dry as directed.Most important, though, is to apply a thin coat. This wax performs differently than traditional natural waxes, and too much wax on the car creates excess work. Apply it more thinly than you think, and you'll have a much easier time taking it off and buffing. A great product."
2,Waste of time/money unless you really like waxing.,"I've owned this wax for some time. It doesn't last more than a month - if that. It's a pain to put on and take off. It goes on ok, but taking it off is another story, leaves a almost a oily residue until you wash your car, or use numerous towels/microfiber to take it off. How much do you really want to rub your paint to get the residue off (I have black paint)? I haven't really seen any good protection from the elements or from birds/bugs. One postitive is that it does smell good when applying it but I'm sure Meguiars added the fragrance for some marketing perspective. All in all, for the price compared to durability - this stuff is a waste and not sure why Meguiars even put it on the market."
4,Best wax i have ever used,"This is the best wax you can find for the money, it do exactly what it says...."
1,"Overpriced, poor wax","I bought this because I care about keeping my car in great shape. And especially after moving and shipping it to Hawaii, I wanted the best product to use even if it meant spending a little more money. I payed $18 at Walmart. I used this product after washing my car. I noticed that within a week, (it rains here a little each night) that water wasn't even beading anymore. I used the product one more time, and same thing, results seemed to wear off within days. You shouldn't have to wax your whole car twice within 2 weeks.I have sinced bought Zymol cleaner/wax and am attempting to buff/wax water marks off of my car since the first two waxings with Meguiar's did absolutely nothing.Overpriced crappy wax. I am disappointed because usually Meguiar's makes some very good products."
2,Enjoyable Fun!,"The story line of this film is an enjoyable vehicle which displays the timeless beauty of Brigitte Bardot. This VHS version is marred, however, by the terrible audio and video quality. 5 Stars for Bardot + 0 Stars for the quality of the tape = 2 Stars. If you are a big fan of Bardot (such as myself) you may want to pick to this up to add to your collection, otherwise buy something else."
4,I liked this book,"Whitney Lawford didn't like going to parties, but this was an really bad party, she let Toby Keston talk her into going and it was worse than anything she could image. Whitney got mauled by a drunk, and after having her dress torn she went upstairs to get away from the crowd, and she layed down.She found herself in the bed with Slone Illingworth. His fiancee found them in the bed together, Slone made Whitney become his fiancee, because his Mother had been so happy to hear he was engaged he had to use Whitney to be his fiancee.Slone's mom never met Gleda and Whitney was happy to help out, problem, Slone had broken his engagement to Glenda long before the party and long before catching Whitney and Slone together.This is a good book but I also like Susan Fox, the late great Betty Neels, the late Essie Summers, Rebecca Winters, Helen Brooks, and Eva Rutland."
5,Wonderful soft romantic scent,"If you like Ombre Rose, you'll love this powder. The powder is true to the scent of the parfum & eau de parfum - soft & romantic. I love this scent - it takes me to another place and makes me feel very feminine."
3,Back to the fifties,"James Hunter is a man out of the past. Every song on this album could have come straight out of the Fifties (think Ricky Nelson, Sam Cooke), though the music has updated jazz touches. His lyrics are cleverly crafted and the title tune, in particular, is an instant classic. Clarence Clemons contributes strong, jazzy sax solos. Each track is good on its own -- but unfortunately the band's sound remains so similar from track to track that it gets annoying; I find myself skipping to my favorites rather than listening to the whole disk in sequence. I'll definitely keep listening, though."
5,fantastic!,"Run and get this album.If ya love Sam Cooke, you'll love this modern day charming Sam Cooke names Mr. James Hunter.While you're running for the cd, look to see if his tour is on his way to a town near you.He's a blast live also."
3,Too expensive for what you get,"I felt ripped off by this paperback dictionary. For $35 you only get 84,000 words defined. By comparison, you can pay $25 for the American Heritage College Dictionary in hardback and get over 200,000 words defined.I feel Longman is exploiting their customers, who are primarily ESL students.(...)"
2,OK! JUST OK,"NOTHIN NEW!SAME GANGSTA WANNA BE GUY.OK HE SHOULD BE BEST IN DETROIT, BUT ""TRICK-RICK MY MAN"" U R RELEASIN ALBUM WORLDWIDE NOT IN DETROIT.ANYWAYS HE COPIES STYLE OF BONE CRUSHER AND MYSTIKAL.WHEN HE RAPS HES WORDS WON'T FLOW PROPERLY.I GIVE IT 2 STARS JUST FOR EMINEM.LISTEN TO WELCOME TO DETROIT AND FIND DIFFERENCE IN REAL MC AND FAKE MC."
2,Does not fit every vehicle!!!,"Buyer beware! Although this seems like a well made product it most definitely does not fit every vehicle. I have a 2007 Infiniti G35 and this product will not work in it. The cover is designed to attach at the top with two straps that hook around the rear headrests. However, the G35 has integrated headrests that do not raise/lower and there is no way to hold up the back. The primary reason I purchased this product is due to the guarantee that it would fit. Extremely disappointed!"
3,Not Awesome,"I have another Solvit waterproof bench seat cover, and so I thought this one was the same, but it's not. It's very slippery for my dogs, and they can't seem to get any traction at all on it. Also, I've only had it a few months, and had the dogs in the car a about once or twice a week, and they've torn it."
4,A great seat cover,"I am very satisfied with the waterproof seat cover. It works perfectly on the back seat of my Lexus. I have two dogs, one is a Rottie so he is big. I wasn't able to determine from the ad whether the cover had holes for the seat belts. I was happy to find out when I received it that it does have the holes so I can have my dogs harnesses attached to the seat belt. Good product."
3,Volkswagon Seat Issue,"The seat cover may not be effective if you own a Passat. I'm not able to stuff the plastic tubing in between the seat to keep it from shifting. The seat on Passat is too tight to allow me to do this. Therefore, the seat cover doesn't hold too well."
2,Seat Cover,"Does fit well in my back seat. Order should specify type of car it fits well in. I have a standard sedan, but not head rests in the back, and therefore would not fit well. Could not use cover with rear seatbelts as advertised."
1,Don't Bother,"I thought I had finally found an ideal and attractive alternative to the old blanket-over-the-seat. Alas, my poor dog would not even sit up with this on the seat because she slid around... very unsafe for her. Ever the optimist, however, I decided it would still be good protection under a blanket since it says it is waterproof, so I left it on and put a blanket over it so that my dog could once again enjoy her rides. Without the ugly details, let's just say that it is NOT waterproof and liquids will soak through. I finally gave up and decided to remove it and give it to a neighbor who said she would take it off my hands. While unclipping the fasteners, one of the straps came apart not from the stitched area, but in the middle of the fabric ... it pretty much disintegrated and the whole thing is now in the trash.I have decided that my $10.00 blanket is a much better solution."
2,Dog Bench Seat Cover,"Product is heavy and made well, but definitely not a one size fits all. We have a Dodge truck and the cover was way too small for the bench seat."
3,"Readable, interesting and insightful","Reminiscent of the classic HEAR ME TALKIN' TO YOU by Nat Hentoff in which musicians themselves talk about their music, this is more about a single subject - SEAN PENN - and less about the craft of acting. To that extent it tends towards the hagiography but interspersed is much interesting insights into acting, the film making process, and 20th century history in the USA from the perspective of some very interesting characters not least of whom include the subject's father LEO PENN and mother EILEEN RYAN PENN both vital, fascinating, and vivid individuals. Quite a good read especially if you are a fan of PENN's films eg, THE FALCON AND THE SNOWMAN, MYSTIC RIVER and 21GRAMS"
4,portable cd player,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She really likes it. The only thing is she wishes it had an alarm clock on it.
1,you get what you pay for,"i bought this player to use in my martial arts workouts. i could care less about musical fidelity, since the only CDs i use with it consist of someone shouting out combinations.nevertheless, i was hoping for durability and a reasonable life-span. but after a few months of using it for about an hour a day, it could no longer track *any* of my disks (and none of my other players had any trouble with these.) i tried cleaning the lens, but that had no effect.save your money. buy a sony. this one's a loser."
2,Doesn't smell right,"Ysatis has been my scent since the late 80s. I can't find it in department stores like I used to, so I ordered a small bottle for my travel kit online. Upon first spraying the scent on myself, I noticed that it smelt more powdery and sweet than usual and wondered if it was my imagination, mood, etc. I compared it with my other larger bottle and confirmed that it does not smell the same.I don't know if this bottle was a knock-off or if the formula has changed, but I was very disappointed."
2,An OK read,I read this after reading Lizzie and Jon's story - so I was expecting the same attention to detail. The book was good with the exception of the ending (I won't give that away). How do you spend so much time building to a crescendo only to wrap up the entire book in 3 paragraphs? Also there were several missed opportunities to add to the story. The story ends too soon and left me feeling cheated out of an ending.
5,Does what it needs to do,"I love this since it is simple to use and because it comes with a cover. You can close the lid so that the ""machinery"" / dials are not visiible."
5,Cheaoer than Wal-Mart!,It was shipped faster than promised & the price is $20.00 cheaper than stores! I love this item. Now my pets aren't in the dark before I get home from work!
4,does what its supposed to,this timer work just fine....but it was slightly (and I mean slightly) confusing to set at first. Other than that its been reliable so cant complain
3,Need a lift? These work.,"They work just fine, but are slightly narrow. If you have duals, you will need 4 just for the rear end. The advantage is they are single parts, not stuff you have to stack. The disadvantage is they are single parts and you cant stack them to store them.... 50~50 deal I guess.I prefer these because they hold well on sand and dirt. If they were 15% wider I'd have no complaints at all. They are so narrow I cant see them over the tire when centered so getting on the last 'step' requires two people, the driver and a spotter (unless you like getting out)."
5,WOW ! FUN !,"I grabbed this one as soon as i saw it. Hasbro has done a great job on this X Wing. Very detailed, lots of accessories, great paint job. My only complaint is the lack of electronic features, but even if you have the old X Wing, you should grab this one, it's scaled much more accurately, and slimy little R2 is just sooooooo cute :) Good Job Hasbro!!"
2,An expert's guide for experts,"After sifting through convoluted language and hyperbole, found some not-so-new concepts long recognized by expert skiers and racers alike. Information in this 214-page self promotional guide geared more toward satisfying author's personal ego than introducing new skiers to simple learning techniques. OK for the knowledgeable expert skier, but far too much work for the recreational guy who just wants to have fun. Perhaps a tri-fold pamphlet could say it all?"
1,"You can't make copies to see it in your iPad, BB Playbook, etc","Careful with these DVDs; you can't copy them. You bought them; but they will last as long as they keep in those DVDs. I've bought other DVDs to improve my ski technique and I always see them in portable devices such as my BB Playbook or my smartphone.That's perfectly legal ... Isn't is?But Harb Ski DVDs considered that this is not required and included a security lock; i.e. you can't rip them to see them somewhere else as I do with other DVDs.I can't be travelling or in bed and get the portable computer to see this ... and ... if damaged ... well ... that's it.This is something to be considered ... for me is not useful at... all as it is now.Besides, I went through them and I consider Sofa Ski School (Klaus Mair) or Breakthrough on Skis (Lito-Tejada Flores) much more technically efficient."
1,CD WANT PLAY,THE CD WANT PLAY IN MY CAR NOR WILL IT PLAY IN MY HOME CD. I HAVE CLEAN IT AN IT STILL WANT PLAY. WHAT COULD BE WRONG?
3,Too late to enjoy this hoiday,I'm glad to have received this - but it took a LONG time to arrive from the seller. Hope to enjoy it more next yearQuality is ok
4,Cell Phone Battery,"The cell phone I had at the time was always dying on me, so I bought this battery and it was revived!! A great investment.."
4,Complex but valuable book about money management,"Explains the principles of money management; covers in detail the various aproaches (pyramiding, martingale, fixed fractional, optimal f et al) and shows why they are not optimal for traders. Finally offers his own money management approach called Fixed ratio. Loosely derives from fixed fractional, but reduces drawdowns and risk, while still allowing for improved growth.The book is complex and somewhat dry, there are LOTS of tables of figures and you will need to re-read many sections. The method of money management seems sound enough although I haven't incorporated it into my approach yet.Defintely worth reading as money management has been shown repetedly to be key to success in trading (alongside psychology, emotions and good exit strategies - which are not covered in this book)."
4,A lot better than Mad Catz dance pad,"I bought this pad at an electronic store today and tried it out. It was a lot better than the Mad Catz dance pad that i had bought for the same price. The pad is thicker and the buttons are closer together (almost like the arcade version). It is more sensitive than mad catz, and it has cute little lights on the controller part of the mat that lights up when you press an arrow. The mat doesn't run as much because of the non slip bottom and it comes along with four round double sided sticky things that you can add if you plan on leaving the mat out. A great mat for a cheap price, but if you want the best go for a metal pad."
4,AWesome dance pad but.....,"Hi im am 12 yrsold and i have had mmy dance pad 4 6monts OK this dance pad is a really good dance pad, you dont have to slam on the arrows you can just tap it the only thing that i have a problem with is that it moves on more jumpy and intense somgs for example i will slide my dance pad up tp the front of my room start a song do the song then when i am dont i am towards the back of the room so yah but the dance pad comes with stick on grips so DEFINITLY put them on!! But other wise this is an awesome dance pad!kenzie"
4,Dance Pad for DDR lots of fun,"Being able to do Dance Dance Revolution at home is a wonderful thing! A video game that physically involves kids and is *also* fun to do? It's about time!!!My only gripe is that the games for it are rather pricey for the amount of effort that (apparently) goes into their creation. I can't believe there isn't more competition in this area. I'd like to see some other games that use the pad for input besides DDR - perhaps they will be available someday. It would be nice if the pad came with at least ONE DDR2 game...The pad itself is fairly rugged, though certainly not 'industrial strength' - don't even consider jumping on it with shoes on! It does fold up fairly small for storage, which is nice for a small living room. Overall, a reasonable buy - well worth it to get the kids up off the couch!"
5,The best Traviata I've seen ...,"... and I've seen dozens of them. Some people object to the minimalist staging and the modern costumes. Not I. They provide an ambiance that allows for greater psychological depth than I've seen elsewhere and a small degree of symbolism. This is also the sexiest Traviata I've seen; Nebrebko is almost as beautiful of body as of voice, and she's not afraid of showing what a party girl, then a woman in love might do with such a body. But, golly, is that voice amazing!Rolando Villazón's Alfredo is a worthy match. He sings the role more or less as he does in his DVD with Fleming, but the acting is a bit different. That befits the production concept. Thomas Hampson as the elder Germont is not as imposing on stage as he might be, though his singing is superb.A newcomer to this opera (most likely someone new to opera in general) would find this production hard to follow, but this is the one I'll be coming back to most often."
5,Fascinating Read,"This is a lovely book, with interesting details. The author, who was our next- door neighbor for years, delivers in this book a fun sense of curious particulars that many people, even gay people, probably won't know about DC history. I especially like it because it leads you to the conclusion that DC has been quite a gay place for a long time too. Having lived a quarter century of that history here as an adult, I can corroborate the sweep of the historical narrative. It has been exciting. To now be legally married as a gay couple is the culmination of that history, in a personal sense. Our former neighbor, and a fine guy too, Frank Muzzy conveys this DC historical reality with a sense of drama in spots, and wit in others. It is valuable because it gives a rapid sense of why it is that gay marriage is working out here in this city. It has to do with the strength of the history, which Frank details, which has bolstered DC leaders and public to affirm the dignity of gay relationships."
2,Arrived damaged,"Beautiful item, mine also arrived with chips on the outside rim. Beautiful set, have not received my refund yet but suspect it is a delay due to the holidays."
4,A book from Dr. Von Braun's fellow rocket scientist,This book by Dr. Ernst Stuhlinger & Fredrick Ordway provides the reader with a good insight into Dr. Wehner Von Braun and the space program. My father had the pleasure of working closely with Dr. Von Braun in promoting Madison County Alabama where much of the actual development and testing of the rocket engines occurred. He always said the Dr. Von Braun was a man who got things done and was one of the best salesmen for Madison County and N.A.S.A. that has ever lived. A excellent book on Dr. Von Braun and his team of german rocket scientists.
4,Small Pocket Guide on major openings,"This is a book well suited for a beginner who just wants a general idea of what the major chess openings are. It is certainly not ""concise"". If you are a beginner and want to look into the various openings and want some very general ideas and not a lot of tedious variations, then this is a good book. Though I like the more detailed book of this same nature, ""Understanding The Chess Openings"" by Collins, and would recommend to gain a grasp of opening tactcis getting a book on opening traps - a book on opening traps will give you a good idea of the strong points and pitfalls within the openings."
4,"Ringo's First, But Not Best Tour","This is an import DVD from Ringo's first All-Starr Band tour. While not the best tour he ever did (the tour with Peter Frampton and Jack Bruce was the best one), it showed Ringo finally having the courage to go out on his own for the first time since leaving The Beatles on a proper tour."
1,I think of the pain!,"The only thing worse than reading about Perry Patetic is probablyBEING Perry. Perry is a dark and tortured soul, ascribing thesicknesses within himself to those around him. Unable to heal himself,he instead villifies those around him.Aided by a triad of evilaccomplices...he embarks on a campaign of terror, intimidation, andharassment of the world in general, but the BDSM underground inparticular.The writing and grammar are as insane as Perry. Think""Naked Lunch"" done as an epic haiku. Not even a nod towardsstandards of plot, grammar, or sentence structure here. This otherwisevivid peek into the mind of an evil madman ultimately proves to beamateurish and painfully unreadable."
5,"The ""infamous"" D/s!","I started hearing and seeing little bits here and there about a book called ""D/s"" by Gary S. Kadet, then a little more, and still more. The buzz started to build into a low roar, the more I heard, the more intrigued I became. Finally I bought the book, and I'm glad I listened, because D/s is a novel that needs to be read, absorbed, devoured. The power of the emotion, the mesmerizing fetish scenes, the laughter and the tears all come together to make D/s a sizzling, must-read, first offering from Mr. Kadet! Congratulations!"
1,"Where to begin, where to begin...","Oh, where do I begin to tell you how much I hated this book? Okay, let's start with the plot, such as it is. There's this woman Karen Pashlust. She corrupts Perry Patetick with kink and sleeze and then is murdered by her husband, Bennie. Bennie frames Perry for the murder, and Perry goes on an unholy crusade of revenge and madness.Perry Patetick adopts the ""Scene Name"" Propertius. It's simply one lame and amateurish pun after another in this cliched and slow-paced melodrama. Perry Patetick. Karen Pashlust. Oh, come on!For those who don't know, the name ""Perry Patetick"" is a pun on the word """"Peripatetic"" which means ""walking around,"" or ""being like Aristotle."" And trust me, Perry is no Aristotle. What Perry sees as walking around being an observer of truth is misleading, because Perry sees everything through eyes clouded by his own past abuse, and his own evil personae."
2,Uhh,So I have used the CD player not even a whole 10 times and it doesnt work. The way the CD player is angled it isnt catching the CD and reading it. Only good thing this is for is listening to the radio.
1,GPX Portable CD Player,"The AM/FM radio works fine with this product, but I purchased two and neither one of the CD players work. Not sure if I am doing something wrong or not, but it seems quite simple to use. I wish the CD player would work and then I would probably really like the product."
2,cheap is what you get,"Well I was looking for inexpensive and I got cheap. The remote control is useless without any volume control on it! I bought it to play relaxation cd's in my bedroom and I have to keep getting up to adjust the volume...so relaxing, right? The cd player doesn't always even read that there is a cd in it. The sound quality is poor. I can even hear a slight screeching/rubbing noise while playing cd's. Should have sprung for a little better."
1,worthless junk,"I know this is inexpensive, but I have owned similar or lesser priced items that were far better. As a matter of fact I purchased this to replace my old GPX 'egg' that played faithfully for a couple years. Apparently their quality control has tanked.Sound quality is awful, it has this noisy hissing background that just won't go away. Repeat function only works sporadically and then shuts off (but the noise remains), remote is worthless. It is so bad I won't even try to re-sell it, I think I will just toss it and save someone else the trouble.Bear in mind that it was this way out of the box, new."
5,Excellent product,I bought this for my husband's work shop so that he would stop taking our Bose out of the house.
1,Worthless!,Don't buy this! the sound quality is terrible. It has a white noise that is always there. It won't play any cd's and the FM radio is way off.. you have to go up or down past your desired station and even then it barely comes in. and the port to use MP3 players doesn't work half the time! Waste of $30 for my son to listen to music in his room at night
1,Returned immediately!,"This unit looked ""solid"" in the store, and was reasonably priced. I got it home, unpacked it, and easily hooked it up. The radio played at once, but the sound was weak. The CD player did not play at all. The remote worked, but it would surprise me if it lasted two months. The chassis construction was cheap and this was not the solid unit it appeared to be. Whatever I tried with the CD player did not work. I returned it to the retailer right away."
2,Not happy with this player!,"I currently have this player but I am about to replace it. At the onset the player worked okay, but the accompanying remote control did not perform well at all---in fact, it was just about useless. The sound of the player is okay until you turn it up to high volume, then it creates a ""fuzzing"" sound, especially on bass notes. Before much longer this player just went completely downhill. The CD will not spin unless I put a 10-pound weight (no joke) or similar object on the lid, and even then it has a terrible tendency to suddenly shut off without warning. About the radio signal, I really can't give a definite opinion, since I only play CDs. But from the few times the radio was on I remember that the sound wasn't the best. For the price of this player, I recommend you find another one of better quality."
2,Can not connect to internet,"If I was informed that this laptop could not connect to the web, even after we have purchased a internet on the go wireless chip, I would have purchased a new one. Being that it was a Christmas gift and we have never been able to use this laptop it has been very discouraging."
3,ehh..?,"its an okay comp for fun and music,, but if youre into youtube or looking for some good speed on the web this is not the one"
3,"Good for travel, handy crayon storage","We purchased the color scroller for an airplane trip with our 2 year old. It was a little bigger that what I thought, but he had fun coloring on it and turning the knobs to change the picture, the crayon storage drawer was very handy. They sent the wrong refills by mistake, but quickly sent a replacement."
3,It was ordered for a family member.,"I ordered it for my son, he said it was in good condition and he plays it often. I don't play these types of games so I really can't rate it that much."
2,"did not like it,",I felt the ps2 games had more depth and intuitive control.This game just did not have the same feel to me.A sad end to a great game series in my opinion.
2,Needs a plot,"The graphics on this game are decent, but not great. It is apparent that some effort went into designing the buildings, bridges, etc. The real weakness of the game is the lack of a plot. Yes, there is an excellent game intro. Once you start the game you get a nice, if threadbare, plot. Then you start the play the missions, and you get mission briefings that do little to advance the plot. I expected something, anything, to move the story along.Rent it for an hour of fun, but do not waste the money to buy it."
2,It's as much about the We as the I,"I bought this book because of the stellar reviews, but it's not really hitting the spot for me. It's too simplistic to say that everything that happens is for my ultimate good, or that I agreed to it before my birth. Sometimes we get caught in other peoples' lessons. As an adult, I can always choose to learn and grow from what happens to me--on that point, I'm in agreement with the author. But I would never lay that perspective on a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, for example. Life IS relational. We don't individually create our own reality--we are co-creators, communal creatures. Some people have suffered horrible injustices because of the choices of others. It may be comforting to think that ""God never gives you more than you can handle"" but I don't actually think it's true. Some people start off with so many strikes against them. Whatever the big plan is, it's way beyond the ability of our pea brains to understand it."
4,A Complete CD Anthology of Tavares music still does not exist,"Why can't anyone come out with a truly complete anthology of all the great albums of Tavares??? As others have noted, there are quite a few CD's but none capture all of the many, many great songs of this classic 70-80's music. I guess the only way to get a complete anthology is to purchase the individual songs you want online and burn them on your own CD. I have found ""Penny for your thoughts"" that way. If Capitol or Rhino or any other company ever came out with the complete works of Tavares, i'd be the first to buy it (and I'd pay full retail too!). It would be well worth it!"
1,Don't use this vendor!!!!!!!,I still haven't received this product and it has been 6 weeks since I purchased this! Not a reliable vendor!!!!!
5,Great Memory Book for an Adopted Child,"You will receive a box with instructions how to create a memory book online that is shipped to you once completed in about one week. I uploaded photos and included my own stories from our adoption journey. There are questions that guide you to record your own personal story. I upgraded to a hard cover for an extra $10 (online) and it was well worth it. The book turned out beautiful and will be a precious keepsake for our baby. I highly recommend this for an adopted child. The only thing I wish I could change would be the color of the cover. It is navy blue with brown trim. It's pretty but I wish I could have picked a different color. If you decide to keep the softcover, it will be red (just like the one in the picture). If you choose the hardcover, you will still get the softcover book but it will be bound with the hardcover on top."
2,Burner Covers,"Pretty, but started rusting on the edges after first wash..Would not buy these again..."
4,Classic Brazilian early '80s pop-samba,"A 4-CD collection of several early '80s albums by Brazilian pop-samba composer Joao Nogueira. Includes the albums ""Clube Do Samba"" (1979), ""Boca Do Povo"" (1980), ""Wilson, Geraldo, Noel"" (1981) and ""O Homem Dos Quarenta,"" also from 1981. This set was issued in memoriam, following Nogueira's death in 2000."
3,Still waiting for definitive history,"It's 2007. Why has no one yet written the definitive history of this program? This book provides some general information on the development, politics and 2nd prototype crash, but is otherwise very brief. What can be inferred here is that the performance of the plane may have been seriously flawed or limited, hence its cancellation, but there is no data. Though many of the people involved in this plan have probably passed away, there must be a mountain of airforce records somewhere. I hope that someone manages to get access to it and give a full recount of this very ambitious effort. For now it appears that this book says the most about the B-70."
5,"Exciting, amazing, and wonderful!!!","The Gift Of Magic was a great book, it had alot of excitement to it. I think that Lois Duncan is a wonderful Author. She has alot of potential to her stories. I think that this book has a nice setup and I like how the grandmother gave them each gifts!!"
1,Beginner's Guide to Interactive Scriptwriting,"...would be a more accurate title. The actual title is very misleading; as is the publisher's claim that it is for an ""intermediate and advanced"" audience. I read it in spite of the negative reviews because I'm a professional developer, (8 years of delivering hit titles using a major license), and I'm always looking for good texts in my field. I like to learn from my peers when I can. This book did not provide such an opportunity. All of the negative reviews are accurate, and I only wish I had heeded their advice to avoid this book."
5,this cd caries me high to GOd.,"i had herned severla songs form his album and recomandation form a friend and decided i had to buy it. i was so imprsed with it. i like how she seams she is so syincere toward GOd. i also like her alnis moriset like voice. my favrite songs are GOD, aba go and sin no more. and carry me high. i woud rocmend this cd to any one."
3,"Cute, fun, but poorly made.","I ordered this because it was just so darn cute. However, if I would have known that the inside of the tub has a cardboard lining I wouldn't have ordered it. I assumed from the picture that it would have been more durable, and washable. With the cardboard interior, its not going to be able to get wet for washing, and I foresee it getting bent. That being said, it is cute and I know my baby girl and I will have lots of fun pretend play giving baby stella her baths."
5,Loved it !!!!,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. It was very interesting to see others views on love. This is a must see movie, especially for young adults."
3,Okay.,"Live albums are always sketchy, and this one is no exception. The guitar is sometimes lost in the mix here, especially on Pandemonium (which is more suited to an openning song rather than the closing). And the tracklisting is not my favorite. Songs I really would've like to have on here:Exorcism / Savage Freedom / Hollywood Babylon / Sanity / Money Is Not Our God / Inferno / Mathematics of Chaos / Whiteout / Change / Intellect / Millenium / Zennen / You'll Never Get To Me / Kings & QueensIf you're a huge fan, this will do better than some half-assed bootleg with the one drunk dude cheering over the whole thing. Otherwise... start with the proper albums.P.S. - the Amazon tracklisting is WRONG (it can be so difficult to actually look at the product).1. Communion2. Wardance3. Song & Dance4. Primitive5. Total Invasion6. Bloodsport7. Requiem8. Asteroid9. The Wait10. Pssyche11. The Pandys Are Coming12. Sun Goes Gown13. Are You Receiving?14. Love Like Blood15. Pandemonium"
3,Okayy,"This pretty much goes with the textbook, but since the explanations in the textbook aren't that clear it is really difficult to get this to be used to its full potential."
2,Another tv monopolizer,"I didn't realize this game was for tv hookup. I thought it was one of those launcher things you played with the little stadium. My boys love it though. The noise is really annoying when they pull that little plastic thing to ""launch"" the beyblade. Surprisingly, the graphics are fairly good. Better than those other Atari-type classic plug and play games. Not the game of the year, but good bargain price & keeps my 6 & 9 yr old monsters busy for hours."
2,"This book just didn't ""gel""...","I read half of this book, up to where Ruby has a tragic accident. Up to that point, the story is hard to understand with the two entertwined stories... it just left me saying ""huh?"". I wasn't interested at all in finishing it. ~:-\"
4,Wonderful on salads,"I've been trying lots of different salts to season my dishes. This one is delicious, but I wish it was a bigger container. It's pricey for the amount you get."
5,"easy-peasy, yum-yum-yum!","Super simple to make, this cool and creamy homemade yogurt is a joy. The glass jars are for purists and the whole unit has a zen-like quality to it. I'm going to try a 3rd batch from the original eurocuisine starter packet, as I've read that if re-started within a week, most cultures will last indefinitely, although it's not recommended by the manufacturer. I've contacted them to see why NOT? I purchased an extra set of jars so that I always have back-up. I'm not going to mess with additives during 'cooking'. After chillin', a teaspoon of Agave Nectar or Raw Sugar is all the extra it needs!"
5,You'll never buy yogurt as good as home made!,"I've had this for about a year now and even though I don't always use it (one a month or so), it's a wonderful appliance. I absolutely agree with all the other reviewers that the only draw back is the timer: it's a joke! It doesn't really do anything besides shutting off the light on the machine. It doesn't turn machine off when it's done or doesn't even buzz to get your attention!But all the Pros make you forget about this little problem! Try plain yogurt chilled with a bit of good honey and some fruit and granolf if you'd like and you will never want to buy yogurt in the store again!"
5,Wonderful purchase,"I have revisited yogurt making this fall. I purchased this machine some time ago and decided to get it out again last week. It did not disappoint! I used organic whole milk (room temp. method)with 6 oz. organic plain yogurt (room temp.) and added 5 tbsp. dry milk for a firmer consistency. Turned on the yogurt maker around 10pm, turned it off around 9am, cooled the jars, screwed on the lids and put in the fridge. Heaven!! The perfect consistency with no boiling - I was amazed!! Highly recommend to anyone, particularly if you are trying to ""reduce and re-use"" for the sake of our environment."
4,does what it's supposed to! Except the timer doesn't work,"I love this yogurt maker, but the timer doesn't work.It's just a piece of plastic that turns around."
5,THE AWESOME Euro Cuisine YM80 Yogurt Maker,This yogurt maker is wonderful! Easy to follow directions and all the yogurt I've made has been sooooooo much better than store bought.I use organic milk and the yogurt starter that Euro recommended and it turns out perfectly every time. I cant keep enough made!!You definitely wont regret buying this machine. Get some extra jars so you can do a batch when the other is halfway used so you dont run out. :)
1,*Danger* This thing is a lawsuit waiting to happen!,The plastic end piece on one of the tension bars snapped on the third pull. It has the potential of causing serious injury.
3,Tracks: Yes Mixing:No,"The track selection on this album is definatley worth noting. 'Afterburn', 'Love From Above' and 'Subraumstimulation' are some the better ones. The mixing however is done electronically and the transition between some tracks can at times be fairly weak. Regardless, it is still worth purchasing."
4,the last song!,the last song! there are two full disc of fairly good tracts but the last song on disc 2 is loco way man!
3,Not the best not the worst,"3 stars in comparison with Gatecrasher Discotech set. 2 CD's in this one. First one is not too bad, I would give it a 4 stars. Not a bad compilation of tracks, almost bo boring fillers. The second CD is way below par. I would give it 2 stars. Boring, getting hard-tek and techno-like at times. The last few tracks, are especially boring, more of a tek-trance sprinkled with hard techno. If you don't own a Discotech set yet, go for that one instead."
4,A Good Classic,A great book and arrived promptly. The seller should have erased the $1.00 price tag in the inside cover (since I didn't pay $1.00 for the book.......)
4,$24.57 i.e. 50 cents per tiny bag is pricey,I ordered this to make America's Test Kitchen's light cheesecake recipe. This is pricey but easily stored and handy portion control for snacking. I agree with an earlier reviewer who wrote that these are very easy to eat. I do not detect any cardamom flavor.
5,"Courage, depth, fortitude","This collection is the one I turn to for life's difficulties. I read it when things hit hard at work, and it helps me see how great and remarkable people sustain their goals and themselves through adversity. I give it to others who are struggling with personal or professional issues, and they are universally grateful. These poems speak to average and exceptional people alike. The snapshot of the encouragement and courage that eloquent leaders find in these poems is definitely the touch that makes this book uniquely helpful and valuable."
5,A true Texas Gem!,"If you're serious about growing vegetables in Texas, then this is a must have book. Sam Cotner is a legendary horticulturist and a master in the art of Texas gardening. This book is easy to read and understand, and will be the ONLY book you'll ever need as a guide.Love it!"
3,"Good Bubblegum Pop, that's pretty much all though...","Leah Haywood's debut appearance was fairly successful --- 3 hit singles (we think its love, crazy, & takin' back what's mine) and an aria top 40 album... the songs have great, catchy melodies, and some songs are amazing to listen to, but overall the album comes up short of leah's true potential. Her voice is strong and beautiful, but her songs lack the depth of meanings. Leah Haywood co-wrote this album, so I must give her some credit for that, because it seems that most pop artists aren't capable of writing more than 3 bars, at the moment.So her debut album was pretty good a few years ago, but tell me, where is the follow up??????Sorry Leah, but it will take a bit more to get your album to be a true hit overseas next time around."
3,Good,"I expected more when it comes to blu-ray, but it sure is one of the best performance of Steve Vai."
5,Where the wild things are,"Steve's back, but it's as if he was never gone!Great to see the old stuff, new stuff bundled in the middle and the outstanding growing skills as a perfomer by the genius of the space-age guitar.Also followed by a great band, introducing other kind of strings to bundle with the guitar, creating a soul-powered live gig, a must see!Worth every dime!"
5,Excellent shoe with a cool unique style!,I recently wore this shoe and loved it. Happened upon La Sportiva by accident and was very happy with its good support and impressive arch. I usually need a good insole with my running/trail shoes to support my arches and spread the stress across my feet but didn't even need one for this shoe. I plan to get this shoe again in the future.
5,"Acutely Perceptive, Informative, Profound","A superb study that is as engrossing as it is elegantly written and lavishly illustrated, and a sensitive inquiry into the aesthetics, the history and the philosophy that underpin an ancient and majestic civilization's view of mankinds's place within the cosmos. Both unique and profound. An essential work."
3,Not about Mongolia!,"Readers should be aware that, despite the title, this book as very little if anything to do with Mongolia. The main character, the Monk, is a Han Chinese, and he practises a Chinese style of Buddhism. Some of the action takes place in Inner Mongolia, which is now part of China, but Inner Mongolians play a very small if any role in the proceedings. This is an interesting enough read, but a little more truth in packaging would have been appreciated."
5,Bones Transformational,"I read Bones of The Master all in one go. Couldn't put it down- didn't. My daughter ate cereal for two days. The writing is spare and strong leaving the story to stand in it's own clear light- and what a story! I fell in love reading this book. In love with a Chinese monk- his incomparable heart and beautiful spirit like a dance of light across a bright stream. George Crane is a poet of the first order and his telling of this tale has changed my life. I have new things in my interior world, new places to go...and for this I will be eternally grateful. This is a book I will read again and again- budda and fox, laughter and ageless silence."
3,Not what i expected,"I Was hoping for moré ideas to play at my class that is for Kids under 4 years, not so helpful, may be It Will when they Grow up."
4,"LuluYoga Games for Children: Fun and Fitness with Postures, Movements and Breath (SmartFun Activity Books)","I found this book helpful and used it often in my practice with kids. Games are outlined with all mateials needed, the time the activity will take and what the outcome will be. I found the kids enjoyed the games we played in class."
1,Disappointing,I have not noticed any difference with this cream. There are drugstore creams that claim to do the same thing for much less. When I received the small jar of cream I thought that it was a sample size. It's a very small jar for alot of money. I would NOT recommend this product.
4,nice pan wih good lid,This is a good pan with a great lid to keep a pie (or whatever) a bit fresher and away from potential insects.
5,My wife was very happy to receive them.,"Not only was my wife thrilled, but two of my daughter-in-laws have already marked one each for their inheritance."
4,Excellent documentary in Blu Ray,"I had the Planet Earth in DVD, so when I replaced my TV with the 1080p LCD I got the Blu Ray version. I am completely satisfied. I could have given 5 stars if the rest of the series (besides the Planet Earth) is in 1080p instead of 1080i. A must for a serious nature lover collection."
4,"Great Product, would be perfect if...","I bought this collection because I already have the Planet Earth in DVD and I tought if it already looks amazing on a regular DVD it would be fantastic on high definition... and it really is! The Planet Earth mainly, is amazing, with its fantastic images... Sadly, one of the best things from the original DVDs, the Planet Earth Diares, kind of a making of, explaining how complex and difficult is to produce such beautiful footage, is missing in this edition; and I can't understand why! Also I have to agree with the one star reviews complaining about the package... If I didn't knew that before I probably would already damaged one DVD! Remember to be extra careful! Besides that is a must have collection!"
5,Soil Moist is Great!,"I am filling 3 new flower beds this spring and I think Soil Moist is a miracle! I need to keep these new perennials moist until they get established, but can't water every day. Soil Moist slowly releases water back to the plants' roots."
5,Tall people...,"My husband is 6'4. He went to yoga with me for the past couple of years, but never seemed super excited about it. The first day he used this mat, he said, ""I think I'm really getting the hang of this yoga stuff!"". He said that for the first time he was comfortable on the mat. I wish I would have purchased this mat earlier."
2,Very thin,"This is nice and long, but the mat is very thin and really doesn't help with cusioning your back at all. I would suggest another product."
1,TPM Novelization: Special Edition,"The storyline is ok, clearly lifted from the film and pressed into service by Brooks' adequate talent. Some insights into character development (completely unaddressed by the film), but I do have to give a single star to the totally unnecessary 4-different cover gimmick. Perhaps soon we'll have chapters and extra covers altered/added/subtracted for the re-release of the Novelization: Special Edition."
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased, what I thought was a tub of Bubble Creature Bath Gels for my 3 & 7 year old nephews. I read all the fine print online and no where did it indicate you were only purchasing one small gel for the price listed. (The online picture is deceiving). When my package arrived, I was disappointed. I had to purchase more bubble bath to make up for this purchase.The gels are smaller than I expected but I guess the price should have been a red flag to me that it was too good of a price to be for an entire tub. The shipping was also a lot higher than it should have been for 2 small gels.I wanted to write the review so that hopefully they will update the website to indicate you are only purchasing one small gel for the price listed."
4,The man can play,"I heard him play in person, with Bucky Pizzarelli. Blew me away. Had to have a recording of his. Got this one and love it. He's outstanding and I can see why other musicians love to work with him. Buy it."
5,Great sounds,This is the great music of the 80's and anyone who is a fan of this type of music will enjoy this album.
3,"Overly Optimistic, but Somehow Charming","I'm not ""in love"" with this book, but I certainly liked it. A sort of crunchy find-yourself-in-the-Nevada-woods narrative that borders on overly optimistic (while hiding out in the woods to escape her old life, Luna finds, naturally, a wonderful and off-beat man that just happens to live in a tent nearby. Oh, and a son of course. Who, despite his cavities, may just fit in just fine). Despite all this, however, Doris Betts managed to keep my interest with strong writing and interesting observations from the characters."
3,Track List,"Released 2000-------------1.-Tema Introduccion2.-Sube Y Baja3.-Cristobalina4.-Charanguero Mayor5.-El Cantinero6.-Riki Ricon7.-Señora8.-Bla, Bla, Bla9.-La Menti10.-Pa Lo Que Me Importa A Mi11.-Popurri De Antaño"
4,4 1/2 stars,"I haven't heard Underdog yet, but up till now this is the best Audio A by far. There's not a weak song on the disk. It's almost a 5 star CD, and I almost never give a disk 5 stars. Their newer release, ""Some Kind of Zombie"" has a few songs that are as good as the ones on Bloom, but overall, Bloom is the best. This is one of the best Cd's in all of christian rock."
3,It was good...,"I thought the soundtrack sounded really good when I first heard it even though I didn't love the songs all that much. Then I was involved with my highschool production of ""Once Upon..."" and I realized that we sounded better than the Broadway version most of the time. One of the reasons was that the Jester in our play was played by a girl. ""Normandy"" was my favorite song in out musical, yet it sounds terrible in this CD because it is just more pretty with a girls voice I guess. That is true for the other songs as well. It is ashame they won't make a CD with a girl Jester. The two girls in both casts that played Winnifred sounded just as good a Carol and it was the same with most other singers as well. Maybe it was due to the fact that it was live, and I will keep the CD because it is a good memory, but still I wish they would make a new soundtrack (besides the one with Sara Parker."
5,Heavenly Sounds of the Black and Brown Metropolis,"Historias in Revision is a remix and an entirely new effort extending from the previous gem, ""Nacimiento."" With special guests including deep LA underground hip hoppers Acid Reign and many others, Slowrider ventures into uncharted territories taking the listener on a socially conscious roller coaster ride. This album truly demonstrates what Slowrider is about, integrating social justice and great music."
2,What's with Jonathan Yardley? Why isn't he a better writer?,"I read practically every column and review that Jonathan Yardley publishes in the Washington Post, and though I may be a faithful reader, I lack enthusiasm for the man or his prose. G-d knows I've tried warming up to him, but Yardley's pompousness is off-putting. As a prose stylist, his mastery of the English language earns him the two stars he gets by me. Where he fails is trying to present himself both as a reasonable ""man of the people,"" as well as an elite individual to whom we should look up, with awe. The combination doesn't work."
2,Where's The Bowl?,"Why do you put a picture of both pieces when it is only a saucer? Very misleading! I assumed it was a set and was so dissapointed when I got an ""Orphan"" Saucer! So I say again, ""Wheres the bowl?"""
5,Excellent cable,"This is a very high quality cable. Much better than the glorified Ethernet one that comes with the Variax Workbench package. The combination of the Variax guitar, the POD HD500 and this cable are the best combination any working guitarist could have in my opinion. Crazy versatile, awesome sounding, simple, compact and dependable. When you first realize that you can throw out your Variax's perpetually dead battery pack and that you can switch between the guitars, amps, cabs, effects, etc. with just a tap on the POD's footswitch, you'll be hooked with the VDI (Variax Digital Interface) concept. Just one warning, make sure you get a POD HD model that has the Variax port. Only POD HD500 and POD HD Pro have them and the HD Pro would need an additional floorswitch. This makes the HD500 the obvious choice IMHO."
4,Best DVD Tristan\option,"This Tristan is not perfect, not even close. But it is your best option among dull, uninspired and even ludicrous Trisoldes. Compared to Levines this is the mona lisa. The star of this production is J. Meier, not Waltrue. I have never heard of her, but she sings and acts and looks the part amazingly well. Rene Kollo does a good job, though his voice is a little light-which is fine here becuase he is perfectly suited to this ISolde. Matti Salminen is a good Mark, though not in the league of Rene Pape(the only positive of the LEvine)-The staging is actually pretty good. Stick with it and you will be rewarded fully.The first choice in Trisolde since its release and even more so now that it has been remastered."
2,nice but wont work,"wheel did not fit my craftsman, it would have helped to know the the width, or how long the the wheel bolt had to be for it to work. My wheel was recessed on one side."
2,style changed,"The manufacturer of this wheel changed size, shape, and count of the spokes, but Amazon did not update the main photo on their listing, so now I have mismatched wheels. The vendor (MowTown U.S.A.) refused make any accommodate the error."
1,The worst tweeter I have ever hear,"Please leave your original tweeter in your car, don't buy this low quality plastic thing"
1,Does not work in my car. Tries to keep switching sides then ejects.,This does not work for me. It tries to switch sides (i.e. auto reverse) and then ejects.
1,"Skipped, and made a loud noise while in use","This is the first device like this I've ever used but wow this was an awful experience. I got the item today and was very excited. When I put it in there was an awful noise that continued during the use, it was louder than the music. After trying to ignore the noise the music randomly paused and skipped or would stop all together. Don't buy this, big waste of time and money!"
1,Useless,Right stereo channel stopped working after two days..Do not recomend. Not worth the expense of sending it back. Cheap is cheap.
3,Tad expensive but works!,No issue at all.. Does a fine job & the sound quality from my car stereo is acceptable
2,Received wrong product,"I received the wrong product, I was expecting the adapter with the spring cord. Also, my adapter has already stopped working well."
3,Cassette Adapter Review,The picture shows a spiral cord but the seller shipped me a product with a straight cord. Not quite what was advertised.
1,Just Awful,"This is being written from Iowa where recent heavy rains have left a lot of us with very wet basements (or much worse). When our dehumidifier died, we ordered this model. Arrived quickly, but, when we tried to install it, it just didn't work at all. There was a phone number to call the company. We did. The company representative read us back the manual. We indicated our current moisture problems and asked to speak to technical. Despite our pleas, she told us the earliest technical would call us was on Tuesday- four days from now. Not at all satisfactory."
5,PUNK ROCK RULZ!!,"This has some great punk rock classics that made my teen years most memorable. I didn't like the movie much, but the music is great."
4,fun book,This book has a lot of fun and do-able craft projects - for kids to adults of all ages to complete.Instructions are clear and patterns are given.
3,meh,"I've gotten into the warhammer 40k series over the last few years (Horus Heresy) and some of them are very well written and some are well, they remind me of the old star trek novels we used to read in middleschool - pulp science fiction not very well written. Unfortunately, this one was more in the star trek line than some of the better written books, I'd not be excited to read it unless you're just bored."
3,Great for people who are just beginning to build small canvas for their boats,"This is a good book for understanding the basics of small DIY canvas projects. For those that have not sewn much, or don't know where to begin, it has great basic info. I consider it a good starter book, and one that is easily read. If you are a more experienced seams-man, this book is vague in insider tips, or tricks of the trade, and I found the pics are lacking in sufficient detail. If you think you will become a master canvas fabricator from one book, you will have a rude awakening taking on the world of canvas construction. But go ahead and start here, and keep working your way up. This is a good book for starters, to expect it to be more you will be disappointed. You don't go to the hardware store looking to buy milk. Keep it in perspective, it is a starter book."
2,not a good book for interior work,"I got this book to get info on redoing the interior of my sailboat. In Casey's Hull and Deck Repair he makes a reference to this seek out information on headliners and interiors in his book ""Canvaswork and Sail Repair"". Without thinking about it i ordered the book. I could not find one reference to headliners in this book. I guess the ""Canvas Work"" in the title should have given it away. Ive now learned how to make enough canvis tote and duffel to supply the entire U.S Navy, but still have a poor looking interior!"
5,Great music,"I'd only heard bits of a couple of songs by Blackmore's Night before I bought the CD. I was really happy that I did. I listened to the entire cd when I got it and loved every song. There is a mix of vocals and instumentals that flow quickly, and are enchanting. This is a great album!!"
4,"For what it is, it's pretty good","This is the first of the Blackmore's Night records I have listened to, but I know more or less everything Blackmore and the various incarnations of Deep Purple, Rainbow and earlier stuff he did. Blackmore is still a fine guitar player, and the Perfect Strangers style is here again, but in a medievel guise. The lyrics aren't wonderful (they don't often pass the read-it-out-loud test) but the music is stunningly well-produced, the vocals are beautiful, and a couple of songs are just about perfect in every way, the Diamonds & Rust cover being the best. The great thing about Ritchie Blackmore is that he usually outclasses faster guitar players by playing just the right notes, and he does it here again. Nice."
3,alright,"i lisend to the short music clips on this cd and i wasent impressed , i am a major skillet fan but i dident really like this cd i will of course give them some slack because after all this was their first cd."
1,Very poorly made product,"I expected the microscope to be at least functional, but it wasn't. The light would not turn on when turning the mirror (yes, I did put in batteries and the light did work, but not the way it was supposed to). Very difficult to focus through the eyepiece.I returned it."
4,"Limited material, but well written.","This book explores the subject of vibrations within colors, stones, and crystals. The psychic readings of Edgar Cayce observe that all things are made of atomic vibrations. The vibrations of colors, stones, and crystals in particular affect us, thus may have a beneficial influence when worn or carried by a person--if, that is, they are vibratorily in harmony with the individual's vibrations; or if their frequencies are not compatible with the person, the effect may be negative. Without a psychic of Cayce's ability to offer recommendationsm regarding the bewt choices, the only way to learn which is which is by experimentation.It is evident the subject of vibrations in colors and stones was not exhaustively delved into by those persons who presented questions to the psychic. Despite this, the author attempts to present this limited material to good effect in an informative, broad and interesting context. It is well written."
4,Color Review,"Book reflected Cayce's outlooks and presentations, but with less emphasis on spiritually related attributes than I was expecting."
2,Not that great-buy another guide instead,"While the book told me about the most important attractions in town, I was disappointed by the maps and ended up wishing I had purchased another book. Restaurant and Hotel listings were less than adequate and the layout could have been better. I was also left feeling that the authors were pushing an agenda with their highly frequent tips and references geared to the gay travler. Let's Go's Germany book was equally as disappointing and I ended up throwing the book away and buying another guide while I was there."
5,superb,"while rated 'good' the book was actually in excellent condition, IMO; and delivery was most expeditious. I had needed it for class after ordering the wrong book thru amazon even tho it was a click and paste request, i somehow missed the search engine did not ""find"" the exact right book the first time.packaging was exceptionally thorough.Thank you for getting my book to me on time for class."
4,I LOVE it!!,"This is a great toy. I'll give it a four on ""how much fun is this toy"" because it dosn't have a belt clip which stinks.I gave it a one on education 'cause if you want to learn how to put batteries inside a plastic tube, then be my guest.The reason I gave it four stars on durabilty is because after a few battles, it starts to get a few scratches, but nothing big. All in all, this is a great toy and ""buy it you shall."""
5,Changed my Life,"6 months ago when I picked this book up I had so many questions and problems with Christianity. Weatherhead explain why it is ok to be open minded and how I shouldn't feel excluded because there are some things that I don't understand and thus can't believe. The term Christian Agnostic is not a contradiction, there is no reason why you can't be unsure of certain about some things and still be Christian, in fact it is almost essential. I would suggest this book to struggling or confused Christians."
3,"good songs, bad sound","The guy who wrote the review saying that this disc sounded good must have been trying to unload his used copy. The sound is lousy, even by early MCA standards. Unless you are broke, I would recommend avoiding this one."
4,Fun cd for the car,"If your child is wild about Barney then he or she will loves this cd, especially when hearing the very first song, wich is the tv shows opener. They'll just light up. This cd is not that annoying for parents, because it is pretty vast. There are a lot of songs, so it won't get old quick. The only reason that I give it four stars instead of five is that the audio is not great. It's good, but you have to juice up your volume a tad more to hear it well. That said this cd is very up beat but somehow has the ability to put my daughter to sleep at times. I recommend this cd for Barney fans. It's the only one that we own and it is plenty enough."
1,"Bad, Really Bad, Really,Really BAD.","Neither I nor my 9 year old son liked this game. Out of all the many N64 games I've played, this is the only one that has literally made me sick with the eye movement required to play it. The graphics are poor and seem too dark which makes it hard to see things. [...] Without question, the worst N64 game I've ever played. [...]"
1,Don't buy this game!,"This game is bad, simply bad. The graphics are either too fuzzy or too pixilated. The gameplay is awkward, and the sound is uninteresting. I bought this game thinking it would be similar to the PC version, I was sorely mistaken. Don't make my mistake if you're interested in this type of game get the PC version of the sequel."
5,Rethinking the Great Depression,I have studied the Great Depression in the past. Given our current times I decided that I wanted to revisit the subject. This take gave me new prospective about the subject. I was particularly interested in reading an analysis of the mistakes we made then and comparing them to the mistakes that we are making now. I think you will like this book.
4,Bought for baby's room,"We bought this for our baby girls nursery as her ""big ticket"" Christmas present. It's great as additional decor in her room and she seems to really like to grab onto and bite the giraffe when we hold her up to it. Surprisingly she was never scared off by it's size...we thought it may take her awhile the get used it it. The only negative thing I have to say is that it is very life like in it's coloring and I would have preferred softer browns and tans that would have complimeted her nursery decor better....but then again I assume most people are ordering this for bigger kids so take that as it is. I think our little one will really enjoy it as she gets older!"
5,Nicely made and a big hit!,"I bought this for my friends' twins (almost 10 months old) for Christmas. It came quickly and in great shape and it's nicely made (Melissa & Doug do a good job). I was a little worried about giving such a big toy to friends who don't live in a big house, but the mom LOVED it and said she'd been eyeing it ""out on the town."" The babies loved it, too. A favorite part was the tag hanging off the ear -- which now might never be removed! Our only question was that the tag says the giraffe can be posed, but it doesn't really seem very ""positionable."" In any event, the ""fur"" feels nice, the toy stands up well, and it has a really cute face and ears. And it's just the right height to peek over the edge of the crib!"
5,Even better than expected!,"My daughter saw this in the store and loved it. It seemed solidly constructed but the price was a little steep at $100. When I found it Amazon at such a lower price (we got it for $50), I did not hesitate to make it one of her Christmas presents. It came quickly, well packed, and just as sturdy as the one in the store. FYI, it is not sturdy enough to sit on though. Overall a 5 star rating-very pleased with this purchase."
5,Nice Large Giraffe! Looks cool in baby's room,"When I saw this, I thought it would be the perfect addition to our new baby's room. This cute giraffe will stand next to the crib, ""watching"" over the baby. The giraffe itself is nearly 5 ft. tall and has great details (eyelashes, mane, tail, etc). I highly recommend it for a child's room or even as a unique decoration somewhere."
5,AMAZING Giraffe,"Received my giraffe yesterday and let me just say.... it's AMAZING! Looks even better than the pictures. It even has the long eyelashes that giraffes are known for. We are expecting a baby and this is being put in the nursery as a GREAT focul point. The price is totally worth it, and I checked the free shipping option, as we weren't in a rush, but still got it in under a week! Great service. Will be ordering again. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!"
5,Great Giraffe!,"I purchased this for my giraffe crazy 8 year old granddaughter for Christmas 2012. It came sealed in plastic and then put inside a gigantic box. She couldn't believe her eyes when she saw how big it was. She said, ""Now I have gotten everything I wanted for Christmas"". Needless to say she was delighted, which makes me very happy."
5,Wild,The item was a great hit. The tall lifelike animal was a perfect talking point at the Holidays and the kids loved it!
5,Life-like Plush,"I saw this giraffe at my local Baby store. I loved the product, but found the price a little high. I went to Amazon and found it for 25% less than the Baby store and it had free shipping as well. It arrived in perfect condition. I am very satisfied with this gift for my soon-to-be grandchild."
4,Very Good Product!,This product works very well with Windows Vista. Performs a daily scan very efficiently. I agree with another review that you need to fine tune the settings so it doesn't annoy you with every little warning. Plus it's a two year license. Many companies are now using AVG's free anti-virus and with this suite you get everything integrated in one application.
2,Not what I expected.,This product requires removal of the original software. Most upgrades do not. It is an inconveient requirement.
5,Solid cable,This cable is not flimsy. I like the handles that are on this product for ease of use and the ability to run a locking cable through it so it doesn't walk away so easy.
4,Concise and extensive,"Its a good book. The information and is all there, and the author gives thorough coverage on the topics. The reference this book provides is excellent. The only drawback is the book has no tutorials and i have to get them webmonkey.com. I would give 5 stars if the book has slightly more examples, pictures(print screen's) and if the book has slightly thicker paper."
4,God by Rebecca St James,I wasn't familiar w/ Renecca until Worship God so I'm still catching up w/ her earlier music. This is her 3rd & I'm not disappointed. Me Without You is a good rocker. Speak To Me & Go And Sin No More are also favorites.
3,"Good over view, but still lacking","This guide is wonderful if you really needs the ""nuts & bolts"" of the game and what you need to do to pass the third year mark without being kicked out of town ^_^. However, there are many scenarios which are just covered lightly, or not at all. Exactly what should you do When Kia makes his announcement about Popouri at the end of the summer? What's the point of the town thief? What about if you baby is sick? Also, many little details are left out, such as many of the favorite treats (and least favorite) of the towns folk. Some things are just plain wrong. Like saying you get the better fishing pole after you have a pond full of 50+ fish, not to mention many of the recipes are incorrect (You might want to note Chef Sprite's recipe, since it's isn't even listed!).Again, it's a good guide for the basics. You can complete the game with it & do well. However it's no where near complete, and It could have been a much better guide with more attention to detail."
4,Harvest Moon,"Thank you for the Harvest Moon strategy guide. The footnotes in the book are helpful as well. You helped save me some time of always going online to websites to figure out how to find information on the game. Again thanks a lot for the book, have been looking for one for a while.Sincerly,Jessica"
1,why is there a guide to this game,look this game is loved by millons smiple as that.i saw the guide for sell at a store looked though and read the holething (i had a lot of time to spare that day) then irealized that it did not tell me anything useful the very next day i was looking at faqs on the game and found one amillon times better some times it seams like a good thing but may not be i would only recomend this book to people who are frist time players
3,Did not meet expectations,"The game itself seems pretty good overall from what I have done with it. The graphics are pretty nice for the most part, though there are some fluky things, such as shadows and such. The gameplay is very glitchy, however. The game crashes on me almost once a day, and I have a new, nearly top of the line gaming computer that can handle MUCH more demanding programs easily, so it should not be even slightly demanding on my system. The game also will occasionally make ridiculous decisions that simply throw pieces away, or it will make a recommendations to the player to move somewhere that simply throws a piece away to no gain."
2,"Basic stats, just more complicated!","The book overall is a highbrow explanation of elementary statistics, applied to a chemist's world. It does not do a very good job of explaining your base statistics, so I would recommend only people that have had some true statistics courses and background use this book. It provides good examples from an analytical chemist's point of view, but beyond that, the book is useless."
4,Another great Chapter in the Dhampir story...,Another well written page turner. If you have been following this interesting story line then you must buy this chapter. More adventure and action awaits as well as unlocking the secrets of Leesil's past. Good stuff.
1,Poorest Stupidest Fighting Anime Ever,I actually got this as a gift but this will be one very short review the animation was beyond idiotic they drew these characters like comic book characters from the 1990's so over muscled it was sad I just could not believe the character Baki was supposed to be 13.The voices were also sadly pathetic except for a few of them and those weren't any of the main character voices either all I can Say is pass this series up if you like fighting anime fine this is for you but if you want any thing else block this show from you're viewing lists..
5,From a Homebrewer Novice,"I really enjoyed this book. I have a limited knowledge of brewing beer, yet Goldammer has a way of describing the brewing process that is informative and instructional without trying to be cute or overly simplistic. I found that everything in this book was useful and very informative even though its focus is on commercial brewing."
1,"Poor design, do not waste your money","I felt this was an expensive fan and appeared very sturdy, so I thought it would last and last. It was hard to put together and then after only a few weeks of use, it stopped working. Due to the way it is wired, the oscillating fan head snapped the wires and is no longer functional. I have tried to find someone who does fan repair without any luck and I have also tried to contact Hunter directly and they were not helpful at all. I will try again next spring since I can't bring myself to throw out such a large and expensive item.Also note, this fan is very heavy so it was not at all convenient to move around to different areas of my home when needed."
3,No All Foods Safe--but everything looks delish,"I looked through this book and while it has some very tasty looking recipies in it, they are no all safe. The goat cheese thing another reviewer brought up is debatable (if it is pasturised or used cooked it should be fine), as is the wine (alcohol does boil off), but the big fish (swordsfish, fresh tuna--or for that matter regular canned tuna more than once a week) that are featured in a number of these recipies are no nos for sure for pregnant women. Mercury poisoning is a VERY serious thing especially in the first trimester, and the big fish are full of it.That said, if you buy it as an educated pregnant person who knew what to avoid, it looks like it would be great!"
4,My daughter loves looking at pictures of family & friends. This is a very durable & cute toy.,My 15 month old daughter loves looking at pictures of family & friends. I have been using these photo albums since she was as infant but needed to buy more albums because she loves them so much. This is a very durable & cute toy.
1,Disappointed,"This unit was truly not worth the purchase. It took long periods for satellite conction to become effective. The planned routes were quite absurd and did not get me to my destination. The worst part of having this unit was that although a particular address was entered, the unit overrode my destination and landed me elsewhere. My experience with other brands has been much better. I do not recommend buying this unit."
4,Nice Product,"Have had the Iway 250C for almost a year and it does all that I ask. However, upgrade required directly from manufacturer was difficult to perform. Needed help from a computer geek. Compared it to this year's models and found no reason to change."
2,Lowrance Failed The Test,"I had seen the Garmin StreetPilot c330 in operation but purchased the Lowrance iWay 250c because the literature indicated it offered the same features at a lower cost. I was wrong and returned the unit. I found the Lowrance to be difficult to use. Putting in a specific address was the area I found most troublesome. Secondly, accuracy in recalculation was way off. I missed the destination on purpose and let the machine guide me back to it. The machine missed the location by two blocks. I paid the extra and bought the Garmin c330."
4,Good Deal,"This is a great product , the only bad thing that i didn't like about was that it's just a pain to cancel your route destination, and you don't see the streets name while your driving. It feels like you are driving in the desert."
5,magical,"This is a hard record to describe. It reminds me of a lot of stuff (Captain Beefheart, Frank Zappa, The Who, Royal Trux if they could pay instruments and sing and weren't obsessed with the whole heroin aesthetic and a dozen other bands) but no comparisons really fit snugly. The FF's create something that is uniquely their own with Blueberry Boat. This is a great rock album made by musicians who love great rock music."
5,Fiery Furnaces is Hot!,"What a relief it is to listen to this album! Finally, someone is doing something new! I can't stop playing this album. It gets better and better with every listen. I especially love the title track. Caution: Not for the average listener!"
1,"Come on, now, be honest","Can you honestly say that you enjoy listening to this mess?If you ever needed proof that the proverbial ""sucker"" is born every minute, look no further than any of the 5 star reviews on this page...Good god, you people are easy to fool.I sincerely hope that this band is some sort of graduate school sociology experiment to study herd mentality. ""We'll create the most annoying and soul-less music imaginable and give it a glowing review on a hip indie-rock website and see how many bite..."""
1,Worst Ever,"Yo. Don't even do it. The Worst Ever. Ever. You don't have to do this to yourself. Take your cash and throw it out your window...The First album and the EP, they're ok. This is a pile of poop."
1,"Not at all melifluous, not at all","If you like experimental albums, maybe you'll enjoy this. If you're anyone else, I really doubt you will.I loved Gallowsbird Bark and pretty much hate this album. I find it largely unlistenable. It has a few flashes but they're brief/quickly yanked away and substituted with something dreadful and headache producing."
1,I bet you feel pretty silly now,"Especially now that it's 2008 and YOU'RE STILL HERE! ha. and for all of you that actually beleive this junk, SHAME ON YOU! Your breeding rights should be revoked."
1,her prediction didn't happen,In the Bible there is only ONE test of a Prophet and that is if what they say comes to past. Good intentions don't cut it. the book is good for the fireplace.
5,"not sure how I lost this CD, but it's being replaced as we speak...","This is one of my favorite CDs of all time. The music truly is timeless, even though it was compiled to appeal to the kids who were in the WWJD craze of the 90s.The artists who are on this CD are some of the best of all time in the Christian genre.Well worth the money, especially now that you can get it new for about 5 bucks, including shipping."
4,Great CD!,"THis is a great CD! Even though it was produced 7 years ago, the music is timeless. Also, the NIV software on it is SO helpful!"
4,where's the caper berries?,"Delicious, well-packed, olive mix. Just a little bit too salty (rinsing them fixes it). But except for the saltiness, and the disappointing lack of caper berries (there were only 10, I counted), it's a yummy olive mix with lots of different olives."
4,Nice Olive Mix,"I bought these to sample the variety. I like them. There are a fair amount of herbs, garlic, and sweet pepper slices that add to the variety. I would set these out for company, snack, or meal without fear. Enjoy!"
5,Power Window Motor,This item was purchased for a missionary friend in Ecuador. The dealer was going to charge him $300 for the OEM part. We were able to order this part for $55 and it worked just as expected. They shipped immediately and the part arrived several days ahead of the expected delivery date. It was a pleasure doing business with Auto Parts Warehouse. Thank you! Steve
1,Ab Lounge XL,"The Ab Lounge does not move smoothly while exercising, the best word I can describe it as ""clicky."" It is easier than sit-ups. My Ab Lounge came with a broken computer and I suspect it was a return as the battery was already in the computer and it came with instructions on how to add the battery. I did add washers as suggested in an earlier review and it is clear why it was suggested. The fabric band instead of a bar is not what I expected. I thought it would be easier to hold your arms there, but it feels tight and uncomfortable. Less than a month of having the product, the left pedal fell off and it is not made to easily put back on. To return the product (which I should of kept the box laying around my house) I have to pay for shipping and it is inconvenient to get it boxed and shipped. I would not buy this product again. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless they bought one from the store nearby which makes returning easy since the product is not made sturdy."
3,Not quite sure,"I have used this product religiously for the last month. While it is still early, I see some progress. No question that it probably will work! However, the machine is rather bulky and failed to fit under my bed while folded up. Also, it feels kind of scary while using it. Its obvious that it isn't build with the best materials. The hinges are squeeky during movement does not feel steady."
4,Boxed set value,"The price on this set is great, and the show is well worth the price. I found the quality of the DVD's I received to be somewhat lacking, but they did all play without issue. Slightly lower quality than I was expecting, but still a good product."
3,Scratched/Skipping Discs,"When I paid for this product I expected a good quality product; not poor quality, burnt CDs with obvious computer printed covers that had bent corners. Multiple discs in the first few seasons were so badly scratched that I was unable to watch the rest of those episodes or the beginning of the next episodes on the discs."
3,"Beautiful Model, Just Not Durable for Real Little Kids","I'll make this really quick. Papo makes extraordinary models. This Spinosaurus is no different' The detail is amazing, the size is very impressive, and overall it's a great piece.The only thing I would say is that if you are buying this for little kids that are pretty rough with their toys, it will likely break. My 3 year old busted the right arm off a week in. Later, a another piece. Later still a toe.He still plays with it, and loves it as, again, it's a great toy. However, Shleich dinos are far more durable. We have about 12 of them - they add up with 3 boys - and we have not broken one yet.So, I - more like my boys - highly recommend the toy with that one qualification."
1,Disappointing,"Just got to say thank goodness for gorilla glue... The first week we had the spinosaurs it's arm came off. Glued it back on with gorilla glue. This week I had to glue the tongue back in, today I found the arm on the floor. Breaking out the glue again!! Very disappointed papo!!"
3,"Close, but not very powerful","Essentially a series of vignettes from past Goldsmith horror & thriller scores, but with fewer of the accompanying chills. ""The Haunting"" is a technical wonder, with mature themes, motifs, and strong moments befitting a composer of Goldsmith's sagacity, yet they never quite gel emotionally; the musically over-streamlined disc does not help, and neither will residual memory of the film (for those who had the misfortune to see it). By the end, the music is as potent as a mildly distraught pussycat."
2,Greasy little cakes...,"The icing was paraffin-like and the ""cake"" inside was tasteless and greasy. Not like the Petit Fours I have had. Threw them away as they made me feel nauseated."
2,Metal rivets do not belong on a guitar strap,"Had I read the description more carefully, I would have noticed this aspect of this strap. Because I play only acoustic guitars, I do not want to use any accessory that might scratch or damage the surface of my solid wood instruments - including the new Guild that I purchased this strap for. It looks great - tough and honest. However, the metal studs are a rather serious design flaw that render it a bad choice for acoustic use. Maybe for electric guitar players who want to add a touch of metal to their metal. My own fault for not reading more carefully before ordering. Don't make the same mistake!"
5,"Wonderful, Amazing","This is a cd for anyone who like either alternative or christian rock. This cd changed my whole view about christian music. DC Talk has shown that even non-christians can enjoy their music. Buy or borrow it, just listen to it.Oh, and just so ya know, my normal music is along the lines of Metallica, NIN, and Aerosmith, and I still liked it. Forever will I be grateful to my friend that got me to listen to it..."
4,I gave this one a B at All About Romance,"Susan Wilson writes in an evocative albeit unassuming manner. This book is written in two distinct parts, the first being solely from the female protagonist's POV. The second part is written from the POV of many of the characters. Underneath it all, this is a romance, but not in the ""genre"" style. What makes this book work is that the author presents characters who, although they may act dishonorably, are not immoral. To give more detail would do a disservice to the prose, which ends in a very ethereal manner."
5,A picture book worth the purchase...,"Rainy Day Slug is a whimsical and creative picture book designed perfectly for the preschool-aged child. While at the same time your chld is becoming captivated by a slugs meandering journey throughout a little boy's house, any parent reading the story to their child will become equally intrigued. The colorful illustrations, filled with humorous detail, literally bring the text to life. This book is a must for every child's bookshelf."
3,Great illustrations and a delight to very young children,"The kids both seem to enjoy the silly (albeit forced, as another reviewer noted) choice of words. The book is repetitive enough that it's especially appealing to my one year old, while the pictures are detailed to capture my three year old's interest."
4,A perfect flight across 1/2 of the U.S.,AS usual an excellent portrayal of the characters inhabitilng our southern-most state. Of course his protagonist is morally cleaner than the rest of most of the population.
5,Highly Recommended!,Another gem from the Florida master. Good story and characters. Well written and thoroughly enjoyable. Hop on board and take a ride.
2,Not up to par,"I found this to be not up to par with Carl's other books. Not well scripted, nor logical in thought. Of his older books this ranks at or near the bottom."
2,Mildly entertaining,"This is probably the most interesting thing Audio Adrenaline has put out. ""God Shaped Hole"", ""People Like Me"", and ""Original Species"" are good alterna-pop songs with nice melodies. There's a strong classic rock vibe throughout, but it's not as overwrought as in their earlier material. Alas, most of this album is terrible, with cliched lyrics and one-dimesional songwriting. If you're just getting into music and looking for some good spiritual rock (two things most people shopping for this album probably have in common), get something that will still mean something to you in a few years, such as Plankeye or Switchfoot, or, if you're feeling ambitious, Pedro the Lion. Trust me."
1,Really Crummy,Heard them and seen them. AA needs to listen to some King's X or Gallactic Cowboys. Learn both good theological lyrics and excellent melody/harmonies...then maybe we can give them another chance. But please all the yelling and hopping around....spare me!
5,My Favorite AA album,"This is without a doubt my favorite Audio A album. I remember buying this one the day it hit stores many years ago (wow it seems like yesterday). Anyway this is one of Audio Adrenaline's harder rockin album and is the main reason why I like it so much. With classic songs like ""Blitz"" (a song with another great band The O.C. Supertones), ""Chevette"", ""People Like Me"", ""New Body"", and my favorite Audio Adrenaline song ""Some Kind Of Zombie"". This is a great album by a great band. 5 stars all the way through it just pop it in you won't skip a single song they are all that good. I highly recommend this album to anyone. You want to hear some great christian rock or just great music you'll want to buy this album. Buy it today you won't regret it."
4,Show Biz and Training = Learning and Fun,Lenn Millbower will explain show biz techniques to you and how to use them in training. What this means is that you can become a more effective trainer while your participants actually enjoy being trained. By learning the techniques you will be able to develop trainings that are fun and enjoyable for you and your trainees but most importantly that will be remembered by the participants. It is a comprehensive book that covers all aspects of a training session. Filled with examples and resources this is a book that should be in every trainer's library.
3,My son is happy ....,This is not an educational toy. It is a toy for little boys into wrestling. My son was John Cena for Halloween and now he is champ everyday with the Champ belt. It is the perfect toy for avid WWE fans!
3,A lotta pitures,"The book is practically all photos, in black and white. There is no text to speak of, except to identify (sometimes incorrectly) the instruments, mainly as belonging to this or that important personage. The author admits he is no expert as to the relevant mechanisms or styles behind this collection of snapshots. The lack of color is nobody's fault, but in the end it's a gloomy photo-album, not even in any historical or other order. As fascinating as the instruments would be, if we had some insight into their construction and reason for being, the dominance of singularly menacing thick legged square pianos of the late American 19th century amidst the doily-laden living-rooms create a somber and depressing impression that gave me the creeps. This collection would greatly benefit from a re-publication with text and diagrams by some historians and musicologists. As it stands, it's of interest to people who already know exactly what they're looking at."
3,"Women in the book had no character, were too controled","I wanted the women to have more self worth and be able to deal with life better. They let the main character contol all their lives. The ending was too pat, the bad guy gets it, then the murderer kills himself. PLEEEEESE!!!!!!!"
4,Not Enchanted,"The smell is excellent and on par with what I expect from a Christmas candle. However, aroma duration and propogation is only good, and the candle life is moderately short. At 20+ dollars a pop, I was expecting to be wow-ed."
4,World Music,"This 12-track release has sounds from different countries. There is nothing really from America on here so don't waste your time if you're not ecclectic. Les Nubians started this off well with ""Les Portes Du Souvenir"". The highlights of this albums are ""Kelefa"" and ""The Road To Liskeard"". From Latin America to France this will keep you with an up-spirit. Allow this compilation to take you beyond your living room to an exotic paradise where the warm sun forgets the night. With the live instruments this is a must have for the real music lover."
3,It's really a history of politeness!,"Those expecting a savory collation of anecdotes about rudeness, ancient and modern, will be disappointed. Even Jerry Springer is only mentioned briefly in passing! The book is really about the history of good manners (actually, about the history of books about manners) over the centuries. Witty and amusing in places, but it often degenerates into brief summaries of other books (actually, I found its chief value was the pointers it gave to other, and more interesting, books on manners)."
4,Good and different,"This is slightly sweet seaweed pickle. Lightly crunchy, with a HINT of the licorice complmenting the sweetness (I wouldn't have been able to ID it as such if I didn't know it was in there). All flavors are mild and mellow. Quite nice.I'm not sure about the individually wrapped morsel-sized pieces. I think packed bulk in a small jar makes more sense."
5,A Rare and Great Read,"Cosmology of Bing is a brilliant and fascinating read with compelling perspectives on the lives of students and faculty at a top private university, covering both their separate and intertwined worlds. There are rare, compelling, revealing and often painful perspectives on life and realities. There is Professor Bing Owen and his once beautiful wife, a brilliant poet struck prematurely with tragic health, and Nick Sulpy, a student Bing loves, and Nick's roommate Takashi. The book has wonderful characters and is spun through a yarn with fascinating metaphors on the realities of life on this earth and the vast universe beyond. Cullin's book is not what one always reads about universities, but is a rare insight into what literally occurs on campuses. I bought it via the NYT review, and found the super assessment to be be monumentally valid."
1,Useless,"I thought that this book was extremely useless, and its title very misleading.The author has put little effort in researching and understanding what a PMO is all about, and how it should be set-up, managed and maintained.The associated CD is basic, low-quality PM templates that can be found for free over the internet.Do not recomend this book at all. There are much better references for PMO staff and consultants..."
1,The Project Management Office Toolkit,"I am completly aggre with Leo. This is not a book, its quite simple and general. Definitely its not a good book for its value."
4,Perfect!,"Love the fact that this can go in the dishwasher, as I'm always afraid I don't get quite all the germs off the cutting board. Also, this is much easier on my knife blades than the glass one I had been using."
2,not all it is promised to be,"I have the SLATE version, and have owned it for two years now.(1) The product summary claims that the cutting board is scratch resistant, but I find it scratches easily. My knives were not that sharp, but the board had at least 50 scratches after the first 7 uses or so.(2) The product summary claims that it will not dull knives. This is the hardest cutting surface I use, and my knives have dulled.(3) *The main reason* for giving this product two stars is the following: if I am cutting something more tough/wet, like chicken, then bits of the cutting board come off and stick to the food, maybe one little bit in every 3-4 cuts.(4) there is no lip to catch juices.It was an expensive cutting board and I did a lot of reading before buying this one. I would not recommend it.I have never tested the heat/stain resistance claims."
4,"Good board, can warm with moisture","This is a simple good cutting board, I use it as my secondary board. If left wet, it can warp but it seems to go back to its original shape when dry."
2,Pros and Cons,"Pros: Dishwasher Safe-therefore easy to disinfect, Made of Earth Friendly Materials, Knife friendly, Variety of sizes of availableCons: costly, short life, shows knife marks immediately, warping and bowing after 1 year which means must disinfect after even minor use, hard to clean without dishwasher, absorbs juices from various foods such as beets, absorbs bleach smell which I use to disinfect - 1 part bleach 9 parts water in a spray bottleI bought 2 of these and 1 8 X 6 18 months ago. They were expensive in my opinion, but I felt would last years. I paid about $100 for the 3 and will have to replace all 3 now. I liked the environment friendly materials, but now I have to throw these out because the surface is uneven marking them dangerous for cutting."
1,not dishwasher safe,"It claims to be dishwasher safe but it is not. I put it in the dishwasher but it has this plastic burning smell after that. It stinks up the entire dishwasher. I guess the problem is the labeling. There was a sticker on the cutting board when it arrived. I took it off completely and made sure that there was no sticker left on it. It was easy but it left a mark on the cutting board, you know, like the glue on the back of the sticker was still on the cutting board. There was no way to get rid of it. You can get rid of the sticker but not the glue. After you put the cutting board in the dishwasher, of curse the glue melted in the high temperature. The manufacture needs to use a different kind of glue that will not stick onto the cutting board. I hope I can return this one."
5,Love it!,"I have had my large board (slate color) for about 2 years, and I use it all the time. I put it in the dishwasher routinely. It does have some cut marks on it and appears slightly ""faded"", but I have had no chips, and no warping. It still looks beautiful in my kitchen. I love how light and easy to handle it is. I do agree that it sometimes will slide, especially if I am kneading dough on it - but the new ones now come with gripper corners so that should resolve that issue. I have an expensive maple board, but I never use it since I bought the Epicurean."
3,Not too happy-down to one star,"This cutting board looks great and goes perfectly with our new countertops. Bought as a gift for my husband, who is the salad maker in our family. He is very disappointed. The board moves around as he cuts...but themain problem is that we have had it for a very short time and it has started to warp. Don't think this should happen at all...let alone in such a short time...only a few months since we got it.ADDITION TO REVIEW....We got rid of the board several days ago. The warping got worse and my husbandwas totally annoyed since it kept sliding. Also more and more obvious scratch marks from cutting. Would neverhad purchased this board had we know. Feel that a cutting board should last more than a few months. Changereview to one star for looks."
5,Simple elegant design,Clean eco-friendly product with good lines. Light to handle and easy to keep clean. Surface resists cutting marks.
1,Wrong,the picture and the actual product are not even close to being similar very disappointed if i hadnt needed a cross wrench i would have sent it back
5,A Lesson in the Value of Being and Individual,"This is an exquisite book that is more than just a storybook. It is about ""a shy little girl who loved to draw"" but who suffers because her classmates think her renditions are ""weird,"" only to find....Well, I can't give away the end, can I?Any child--especially any little girl--will love this book. It comes with a tiny palette charm, a place to draw her own self-portrait, and pages designed for other creative efforts.Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of ""This is the Place"""
4,100 simple secrets,"Most of the stuff in here seems pretty obvious, but I think a lot of people lose focus on the things they find important. In my opinion, this book helps us reprioritize. Certainly a book that can be reread when you feel a lack of direction in your life."
1,So Much Potential,I recently purchased this album on impulse. The idea of all of these great artists (I have albums from every artists on this compilation) doing the music of the greatest band in the history of music was too much to resist. Unfortunately it's disappointing. The songs are almost all straight forward remakes of Beatle tunes without any of the fun and energy the Beatles put into them. The few attempts at reworking the songs and making them the artist own either fail or come just short of success. It is a major disappointment.
3,If only Ben Folds could sing,"This is a fun CD of generally good efforts put in to great songs.MOST are well done. Rufus Wainwright sounds like he could have been a Beatle. Ben Folds sounds like he needs to buy one of those ""perfect pitch"" programs so he can cease his habitual ""scooping"" up to discover the intended note. What an insult he is to Beatles music - but fortunately he only gets to butcher one song. All the rest are pretty cool. Buy it - you'll like it!"
5,The Greatest,"This soundtrack is the most awesome thing I have ever heard. If you just like the Beatles, you will love this cd!! Every artist does the songs more than justice and it's just so amazing!! Sarah McLachlan's version of Blackbird is one of the best songs I have ever heard!!"
3,Very few high points,"If you are a real Beatles' fan, I would stay away from this albumn. There is only a few high points on this albumn. The remaining of the albumn is a butchering of some classic and great hits. IF you are a Sarah, Sheryl or Vedder fan, I would recommand this albumn for these songs. Only two other songs outside of the done by three above is worth listening to, the one done by the Wall Flowers and the other done by Nick Cave. Outside of that, I would pass on this albumn."
5,Great Soundtrack!,"If you liked the movie, you'll definitely like the soundtrack. I totally fell in love with it, especially the first part of it. Although there are some songs that I like like less than others, I think that overall it's a good soundtrack. I think that using Beatles songs is an interesting little twist. I listen to this CD all the time, and it's one of my all time favorite soundtracks. If you haven't listened to it before, give it a chance. My favorite songs on the soundtrack are Two Of Us, Blackbird, Across The Universe, You've Got To Hide Your Love Away, Don't Let Me Down, Golden Slumbers and I'm Looking Through You."
5,My Grandmother would have loved it!,"My grandmother was of the higher echelons of Austrian/Hungarian Society backbefore WW1. This is the music she would listen to. Mr. Liszt was of the samegroup as she. I love that! I will listen to the music as I daydream of riding horsesthrough the mists of the Hungarian Plain, and dream of rest along the banks of a clean Danube."
3,good overview,provides a good general background with some widely used business theories and ideas.would be a good gift for the new college grad
1,The funniest thing I've ever seen,"This Chandalere is hilarious. It's the worst thing I've ever seen hanging from a ceiling. The crystals are great for entertainment, if you want to make people laghf."
5,Great book for A-levels,"This text is for A-level students and can get you through the exams with fantastic grades even without having a teacher. The authors give really good explanation for all the concepts. This book and the others by Bostock & Chandler can also be very useful for brushing up on calculus, mechanics and statistics for those students who are starting a masters program after a hiatus of a few years. And by the way I did A-levels and am doing my masters"
5,cute book,Loved this book for my 3 year old son who loves it when I pretend to have the hiccups and when he saw this book of the skeleton having the hiccups he was just smiling through out the whole story ;)
3,Cute Book,"I bought this book for my 3 1/2 year old. It is cute, but seemed a little young for his age group."
2,Just doesn't hold my interest.....,"I'm a Rhett fan from way back. First let me say I appreciate any artist who strives to find a new sound or creative direction - Miles Davis was always pushing the envelope, constantly changing, whether the new sound was accepted by the public or not..but I digress.Although I find this album pleasant, it doesn't have the swagger and energy of albums past. I've given it several listens and find my attention drifting more each time. Oh well...the songs just don't do it for me and it's all about the songs and lyrics this go around. Rhett has always had a knack for writing clever, intelligent songs that are fun and full of energy. I just don't get that feeling when listening to The Believer."
4,Great book,"One of the few books I have ever bought for school that I was genuinely intrigued by. I read it in one sitting, and not just because its a short read, I couldn't put it down. Twelve Angry Men exemplifies many of the powers of the jury and just how important the process is. It shows how deliberation and the necessity of a unanimous vote can allow many points of view to be brought to the light to ensure that everyone is given a fair trial."
4,If you have said Gram who? - Get this CD and find out!!!!,"It is not often I keep a CD on my player for more than one or two plays - this one is in it's second week! It is about time we paid tribute to someone that probably taught the Eagles to sing. Best cut (in my opinion) is Return of the Grievous Angel. Also, artists from the Pretenders to Elvis C. to Gillan Welch show us how respected this man's talents are. Is there a monument for GP @ Josha Tree? If not this CD will show you how remiss his fans have been. Just buy it and you will not have buyer's remorse!"
3,gram would be proud,"this is a fine album of tribute with some great performances from emmylou, sheryl crow, old bandmate chris hillman and steve earle, the mavericks. but what's with those cowboy junkies? i just don't get it. it seems that whole band is on qualudes or something. their cover of ooh las vegas which i thought was a sort of up-tempo song is mired in their slowdown approach. they bore me to tears. but the rest of the album is great. gram would be proud."
2,Pretty weak tribute,"Far from the real thing... Parsons is hyped way beyond his real value anyway. Some good stuff on here, but really not worth the time or money."
5,Love This,"Although I had heard of Graham Parsons, I'd never listened to his music a day in my life. A friend turned me on to this CD and it's AWESOME. I absolutely love it. It's got heart and soul ... that Graham is a pretty cool guy, and the people covering his songs have done an outstanding job."
4,A long lost classic,"This album, though released several years before April Wine's biggest commercial sellers, is still, after all this time, a true pleasure to listen to. In its' original album form, it was pretty close to flawless... all 10 tracks are strong. It was indeed a travesty for Aquarius to cut out 2 of the best songs and rearrange the rest, otherwise I might even give a rare 5 star review to this. I don't understand the reasoning behind this... I guess to sell the other cd that those songs are on. How anyone could give this one star however, is beyond me."
2,At best this book contains 95% fluff and 5% substance.,"The overall theme of Best Impressions is that everyone needs a ""personal full image development consultation"" (which I am sure the author will provide for a fee). At best this book contains 95% fluff and 5% substance. I am incredibly under-whelmed by the lack of detail in each topical area covered. The author repeats every sentence and idea at least five times throughout, which means that this 145 page book could have easily been written in about 30 pages without losing its message. I would not recommend the purchase of this book."
1,save your money,"The author goes off on ridiculous sidetracks about private , academic and government related investment possibilities - all the while completely ignoring the several dozen publicly traded companies that are working on the cutting edge of nanotechnology. Indeed , several public companies dedicated specifically to nanotech are mentioned only once - in a stock chart. No profile or business models are even hinted at. Just a ticker symbol and price. Of no use to the average investor whatsoever."
2,Poor print quality,"I don't know if I got a bad copy or if this book is simply poorly printed. It looks like it was reproduced on a copier that was low on toner which makes it frustrating to read. I am thinking about sending it back and seeing if I can get a replacement that is better quality, but wonder if that would just be a waste of time."
1,missing something,The publishing date in the listing on Amazon is 2007 but reviews date back to 2003! What am I missing?
3,A Good Read,"I just finished ""Our Reunion"" and found it a very simple love story. I felt like I was reading a personal diary. I found myself wondering if this might be a love that Ms. Watson experienced herself. I hope she continues to write and continue to hone her writing abilities. She has a talent and her continued success is eminent."
5,Amazing for a fine point,"Usually fine-point pens feel a bit ""scratchy"" on the page. Not this one. I have several of the Zebra pocket pens (an excellent product that Zebra should consider restoring to their product line) and they write as smoothly as any Cross medium point (one of the smoothest of the under-$100 pens). If you love to write and have a pen that takes these refills, I think you'll be glad you stocked up."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This was HORRIBLE! It was boring, had very little authentic footage, moved at a snail's pace, and was not even worth finishing. I was hoping to show it to my class as part of our Holocaust literature unit; thank goodness I previewed it at home first! Awful!"
3,Six Months to Live,I believe that this book is heart warming and very emotional. This book is full of emotions and expecially interesting to me as a reader. Lurlene McDaniel is a exceptional writer fand i hope to have her career kept alive for her.
3,"Moisturizes, but little else","I decided to try this out after hearing some hype that the main ingredient, squalane (shark liver oil), has great anti-aging effects. I've used the whole bottle up now and I can say that I've noticed no difference in my middle aged skin. It's a decent moisturizer, nothing else."
1,They Know They Wrong,They should have never released this tribute album with others trying to sing Aaliyah's songs. Noone else can sing her songs as she does. Baby Girl had a voice of an Angel.
1,Just don't like it,"Even though I do not own this item I previewed all of the songs. I really don't like the sound of it becuase the people who are singing her songs just doesnt sound that good to a fan who has listened to aaliyah's songs over and over again from the first time she came out as an artist. It is not the same. Yes, I know it is a tribute to her and it is a wonderful thought but I enjoy listening to aaliyah's voice singing the songs that are on her albums and duets w/ other artists. I don't know if anyone has ever listened to kareoke before but that is what i think this whole cd sounds like and that is why I really don't want to own this item. Maybe in the near future I will change my mind and decide to purchace this item."
1,some tribute,"I only listened to the samples and laughed through each one I heard. I only picked one star because I had to, this so-called tribute didn't earn it. This is one word...GARBAGE! Save your money and stick with the originals."
1,A DIRE KARAOKE ATTEMPT AT BABYGIRLS MASTERPIECES!,I swear down the songs on this So called Tribute are awful!!!!! the only reason it gets one star is cause of the picture of Babygirl on the front! Why the hell did they wreck the songs like that!
1,HORRIBLE,"I didn't know if i should laugh, be angry, or sad.....this CD was terrible, the singers sounded awful. Why didn't this just get a complilation of her hits and put them on one CD....it would have sufficed way better then the howling ninnies on this CD. I'm sure they put their all into this CD, and the gesture was kind.....but face it..........they couldn't even come close to Aaliyah and her talent. I'm sorry .......i wouldn't pay to listen to this........they'd have to pay me !"
1,THAT WAS AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THAT WAS THE WORST THING EVER> NO ONE CAN SOUND LIKE AALIYAH>>>>>>>> WHAT A Disgrace!!!!!!!!!!!!! AALIYAH IS ONE IN A MILLION and no one can sing like her.......
1,Tributes are not the best cds to buy.,"Ok,so everyone's telling me all tribute cds for ANYBODY out there just plain [stink]! well i wasnt sure if it would be true for me.So I went to [local store] or something(i dont have real player) and i heard part of the songs AND THEY'RE AWFUL! Aaliyah isnt singing these songs.Its just some other people trying to,and they [stink] so badly at it. You really don't wanna get this cd.The tribute cds are always horrible. Instead of getting tributes,if they have one get a greatest hits becuz they have all their best songs and the actual people are singing them.Don't get the tributes.Hope I helped some."
4,Classical Wedding,"This is a good quality CD but I used only ""The Wedding March"" from it on the CDI made for my wedding. I used what I thought were more romantic classical andsemi-classical tracks from other CDs for the remainder. I received the CD in less than the estimated delivery time."
4,"Good recording, with some minor imperfections","This is basically a string quartet with brass when needed. The string pieces are all generally very good. The music was studio recorded, so the sound quality is very real. However, during many of the brass sections, the mics pic up the musicians taking breaths, which is annoying. My fiancee and I are thinking about using recorded music for our ceremony, but the breathing sounds may prevent using this particular CD. However,for the music itself, it is still better than a few other wedding CDs we have heard so far."
3,potentially biased,"The documentary is a potentially one-sided bias presentation about wars that could possibly arise should The US wirhdraw from its foreign bases.It is potentially biase because there a more sides to it. Can we afford it? Do they want us? How will a withdrawl affect us, our security, various globlal angels of security In different regions, industry related cut backs to economic outcomes as a consequence, and who may be benefiting from either position.The documentation Just focused on one thing. It was all geared towards catastrophe without The USA."
4,Delicious tea.,A blend of spicy and citrus all in one. Can't help thinking of Christmas when you open the tin. Strong flavor of cinnamon and oranges. Reminds me of making mulled wine and decorating oranges with cloves for the holidays.
4,60s perspective,"I enjoyed this book and sailed right through it. It's a story of personal adventure that captures the cultural mood of the times, as experienced by a thoughtful young adult caught in the crazy stew of the late 1960s. There is sex, drugs & rock & roll, moral reevaluation, mystical events, all tempered with the perspective of 20-years-later hindsight. Charbeneau's philosophising on the state of man and his world is woven throughout, bringing insight to his character's motivation, but also shedding light on the thinking of the times. If you wonder what all the hubub of the 60s was about, this story brings an insight into what it was like to be a young person experiencing (at least a facet of) it firsthand, and how it resonates today."
3,good for the developing and undeveloping brains,"I bought this for my kids to play, and because of their differing learning styles and ages, I found I had to moderate the game. It was best if played by a child and a loving and attentive adult. This way the child can be challenged without being demoralized by someone who has a quicker or more assertive verbal aspect. In any case, I think this would be a great game for a grandparent to play with a child."
3,Not up to the usual high standards of the McCone series,"I have read all the Sharon McCone mysteries in the order they were written and am a big Marcia Muller fan. ""A Wild and Lonely Place"" was the most disappointing book in the series so far. Most of the suspects/new characters were dull, I figured out the mystery WAY too readily, and the writing was surprisingly cliched.I hope that this book does not mark a downward spiral for Muller. But.. if it does, she's had a great run. (15 books in the series prior to this one.) If you don't know her work, start with the first McCone mystery, ""Edwin of the Iron Shoes"" and go forward from there. Don't let this one turn you off."
2,Egyptian Perpetual Calendar,"I was extremely disappointed in this purchase. The description stated it was in good condition, but when I received it I found it to be very warn and faded. Had this been the first purchase I'd made with you, I would no longer be a customer."
5,Very Good!,"These olives are very good. I had thought about ordering them for awhile now and I am glad I did. The herbs are not overpowering. Great for snacking, or with a meal. When they came, I had them for lunch with sliced tomato, tuna in olive oil, with a soft boiled egg. Perfect summer lunch."
5,If you like olives you will love these,Olives in a jar are hard to find if you want an olive antipasto. at the deli you wind up paying $3 for a small plastic tub. these are grea and very reasonably priced. you do need a large plastic tub or 10 small plastic storage tubs to keep them in. they take up room but they also go very fast
5,if you love olives,exceeded my expectations ! Very tasty and not too salty. We have enjoyed them by themselves but are great on a salad.
4,BEST CHRISTIAN ROCK BAND EVER!,"Grammatrain is, by far, the best Christian rock band to have ever played the scene. Although, I recommend their first album, ""Lonely House"", as FIVE STARS above this one, being my favorite album of all time. LONG LIVE GRAMMATRAIN! And by the way, don't forget to pick up their farewell album, ""Live In Germany""... if you were lucky like me, you actually got to witness them LIVE (5 times, myself). God bless!"
5,Buy This Now,"Perfect! If God truly exists, She owns a copy of this disc.If you do not have this recording,go buy it! You owe it to yourself."
3,What can I say.....,It's a book about leading music. It was a required book for me to get so.....I guess it's alright if you want like that sort of thing.
2,Not the best seat,"I bought this seat for my daughter's 1st birthday. At first she seemed very comfortable in the seat. But when she falls asleep her head is not supported at all. It was also very hard to install it in the car. My car does not have the LATCH system so I had to have it professionally installed. Changing the shoulder straps was a plus, it is alot easier to do than most seats, the extra padding is a plus also. I just wish it had more head support. I'm hoping my daughter will be more comfortable as she gets bigger...only because I can not take it back and it wasn't a cheap seat just to throw it away. I would not reccomend this seat to anyone with out the LATCH system in their car. The recline is nice, but once I recline it for my daughter the seat is not tight at all in the car and moves with every turn I make."
4,Great for big babies,"Since our larger 4 month old was too heavy for his carrier seat, we looked for a seat that was easy to use for such a young baby. We found it!!! To secure him is the easiest, and no thumb nail breaker buttons to push!The only thing we do not like is that the baby puts his hand under the pad on the side and scrapes flakes of styrofoam off of it.. this not only makes a mess, but he sometimes gets it in his mouth.As long as we watch this, we still feel that we picked the right seat for him!"
4,"Nice, comfy carseat, but a little difficult to get child in & out","We have 2 boys - age 6 & 1 - and recently bought this car seat for the baby. It is a comfy seat for him ( and he does fall asleep in it quickly!) but it is a little difficult (read slow!) getting him in and out sometimes because of the belt system - especially if he's in the ""I'm not getting in my seat kicking and screaming"" moment. My older son's car seat was easier in those cases. The belt system on this seat has a crank that you turn to tighten that tightens the belt from the bottom, and a release to loosen it. It takes two hands - and that's the issue - no free hand to hold the little one in!We bought this seat because of the consumer reports safety ratings, which are the most important issue to us, so it's top notch in that department.Overall a good seat, just a little clumsy!"
3,No padding in the seat!,"I purchased this product because of the price for a second car (I already had a Britax Marathon). However, there is no padding in the seat, and I can image it would be very uncomfortable for an infant/toddler. Also the height on this is too short. By the time your child reaches the top notch for the shoulder straps, their head is above the seat. I would definitely just by a second Britax next time and save buying another seat after this one."
2,"Easy to Install, But That's All","We purchased this carseat after reading numerous positive reviews and after researching safety rankings of carseats. This seat was very easy to install in both of our cars (one w/ latch, one w/ a seatbelt) but getting our daughter to stay in the seat is a whole other problem. The harness never seems to fit her quite right, even after adjusting multiple times. I constantly have to pull over and fix the harness straps because she slid sideways in the seat. I have a horrible time working the harness--it seems like it should be easy to loosen, just pull the knob, but I always wind up having to fight with the shoulder straps to get both sides to loosen. The shoulder straps are a ""double strap""-there's an upper and lower strap on each side, and that makes it really confusing to work. I gave the seat a month for me to get used to using, and then I took it back."
1,Dangerous!,"Straps difficult to use, lower set of straps not joined by chest clip so will fall off child's shoulders and cause serious injury to arms in crash!, returned item to store where purchased immediately."
2,Sounds small,"The sound was well ""small""... it's a midrange speaker and can handle power without distortion, but it lacked depth of sound and music appeared muffled and small."
3,"Decent, as far as it goes","The title and book description are both misleading, and frankly, I think deliberately so, given that the book does _NOT_ even attempt to address Palm development. This is _NOT_ a Palm OS developers guide at all, it is a Palm Web Clipping develoepr's guide. If that's what you're looking for it's not a bad resource."
5,A Fine Twist,I love monopoly. It is one of my favorite games. It has a lot of strategy and luck. Lord of the Rings is another thing that a like. Put these 2 things together and you get one of the best games ever. It is quite a twist. Along with this I would also recommend The Lord of the Rings: Risk. As in Monopoly a twist with the lord of the rings is just what any strategic game needs!
5,wonderful stuff..,"""Alt-country"" would indeed be a limiting description,none-the-less an accurate point of reference,as this artist is obviously drawing from past Country musicians.But make no mistake,this is not a tired retread thru the same-old same-old but rather an exceptional modern piece of music.I'm usually more inclined towards the Heavy than the twangy,but this is just so well written and catchy with a distinct melancholic cloud hanging over the proceedings,and this woman can SING.One of the few recent musicians that deserve that designation!"
4,"Vocal from Heaven, Lyrics from...?","This album is worth your time for the vocals alone: I've been listening to this for the past 6 months and I'm still floored by Neko Case's vocal range---I'd argue her voice is perhaps the finest in ""popular"" music at this time. That being said, this album isn't for everyone. But if you enjoy challenging lyrics, simply stunning vocals and a wonderful alternative country flavoring please give this a listen, you will not be disappointed."
5,Food & Travel in one,"Italian food by region. Lots of photos & articles about regional specialties in addition to recipes. I like looking at these books for inspiration, ideas and information about ethnic dishes."
4,Bought it ONLY for Junior Vasquez & Dynamix Club Mix,"Here we go (i'm into club music only so my ratings may not always suit you):1. Album Version - a decent mix - rating 3/52. D-Bop 3am @ Crash Mix - a decent mix - sounds breakbeat, electro - sounds good but not too fast BPM, vocals seem too quiet in this mix - anyway 3/5.3. Junior Vasquez & Dynamix Club Mix - this is a gem! fast & furious mix and i love it! If you like Junior's or Dynamix mixes you must buy this. The only reason there is to buy the CDS. I bought it only few minutes after i heard the mix. It's THAT good believe me. My rating 5/5.4. Noizetrip Mix - very slow and sounds R&B; to me - 1/5.5. Who cares about the video when you can easily get a SVCD verison or better ^^ Still it's funny.Someone mentioned the Hani mix. It's not that good. I know only one Pink mix that i find better than Junior/Dynamix. It's Pink - You Make Me Sick (Hex Hector & Mac Quayle Club Mix)."
2,Peeling,Started to split as I unrolled it and the pieces I did apply to the doorframe are start to split and peel off little rolls of plastic.
1,"Old, dry, and flaky","This item arrived old, dry, and flaky. It was unusable throughout. Amazon needs to bring this vendor to task or drop them completely."
5,"An exceptional corner of the history market, cornered.","All great historians share an ability to peel layers and intellectually exercise issues. Adolphson, however, manages an unusual success with ""The Gates of Power"" by, one, bringing to light poorly understood, often unjustly disregarded, subjects in Japanese history (the precise role of temples, courts and warriors in medieval Japan) and, two, challenging the insipid historiography frequent among Japanese academics; something non-Japanese with experience in Japanese academia can relate to and appreciate.Adolphson also posses a serious and necessary challenge to non-Japanese students and scholars of Japanese history who disservice the profession by willingly accepting and regurgitating the subjective interpretations of the aforementioned Japanese scholars.The Gates of Power is an excellent read and resource into temple, court and bakufu motivations and policies of the pre-Onin period."
5,One Of The Most Effective Fitness Books I've Read!,"I've been a personal trainer in New York City for the last 8 years and have read countless books on the subject of fitness.For the last 2 months I have implemented The Body Sculpting Bible techniques into my personal training programs and have seen truly impressive results with all of my clients.No other book has provided me with such effective and useful tools that have helped me help my clients achieve great progress in such a short amount of time.Because of this book, my personal training business has absolutely increased. If you're looking for a straight forward, realistic and effective fitness book for men, this is a must read! By the way, they also have a female edition of the body sculpting bible that has helped me as well."
4,excellent comprehensive reference for male body builders,"15 year fitness trainer here and i often give this book to clients who are having difficulty staying focused and on track...the authors' pointers on form are the best i have encountered in any fitness book...they know all the tricks successful body builders use (and even some i thought i had ""discovered"" myself, hehe) the nutrition info is current and ideal for those wishing to train ""naturally"" (ie: no steroids.) every male gym goer needs to read this book."
2,Simply Awful,"How on earth is this book averaging 4-stars? First of all, there is nothing in this book that is ""new"" by any means. Second, this book has the worst editing that I think I have ever seen. It seems that every other page has either grammatical errors or, even worse, unfinished sentences."
5,Very good book!,"I highly recommend the BSB as it is very thorough. It will give you details on exercises and forms for all body parts, as well as substantial info on nutrition etc.Very serious and pro!"
3,Not the same.,"I fell in love with the original scent scent when I happened upon a small bottle that belonged to my grandfather. It was masculine, fresh, and not overwhelming. Since then, this scent has changed. I had purchased a bottle, and was extremely disappointed when I tried it. The scent has become far too flowery and light, and reminiscent of talc, which can be had for a fraction of the cost. If you're looking to find a piece of the past, this is not it.That being said, it is fairly pleasant, though likely not the best for someone looking for a masculine scent."
2,Cheap Craptastic,"I've been playing these games since they first came out. I'm about as big a fan as they come. And I was VERY disappointed with this item. The right arm isn't actually a right arm. It's a left arm they just put it on backwards. So all the joints, including the hand, are on wrong. And there is nothing you can do about it.I liked that there were lots of accessories. And it looks good on my shelf as long as no one gets too close.Skip this and hope they come out with something better in the future."
3,Eh,"Eh. Wasn't gripped by the story. So much so I hated that there was another book because I just wanted it to be over. However, there was some entertainment and it was an easy read."
1,Very Bad Writing,"Okay; normally I'm not one to poke fun at an author who wants to write erotic fantasy, but this novel was just so bad that I could not finish it. The story is absolute drivel. How in the world do we go from a ""wild"" child running free to someone who instantly falls in love with her master, without any warning whatsoever, and the master character in the book is not even charming or likeable in any way. Perhaps the author had to just gloss over the fact that her main female character just had to fall for her master as a pleasure slave, otherwise, we'd have an erotic ""rape"" book on our hands here. The author should stick with urban or romantic fantasy and leave the erotic writings to more experienced experts."
4,Photos Helpful,"Photos of movements helpful, however, subtle changes are a little difficult to visualize. Good supplement to DVD."
5,Love it!,I had this CD in tape form from days gone by and it broke because of it's age and because I played it so much. I was so excited to see that it was in CD form! I received it in a timely fashion and it was in mint condition!
5,Living Legacies,"We bought one book , loved it so much , bought one for each of our grown children for their families. Since we are the last of our line , we wanted our life stories to be on record. This book helped us organize our family memories in a way we haven't been able to before we purchased the book. M.& V. Emery of Maine"
1,one song,There is only one song that Bradshaw sings; it is lovelybut the rest of the tape - notsomuch.cyn smith
4,Diamond Bay,"This was the first Linda Howard book I have read and I found this one really enjoyable. The characters were interesting and well described. The plot was strong and pretty straight forward. However, I was surprised at the amount of sex in this book, not that it was a bad thing. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a really fun and easy read!"
2,Disappointed,"There are 3 dvds in the package. The first one was ok, the last two were silly even for pictures of this genre. Enough said,"
5,Annie Herring At Her Best,"Glimpses is an incredible collection of songs by one of the most accomplished Christian song writers of our time. If ""I'll Be Waiting"" doesn't take you to Heaven it will at least give you a glimpse of the gates. A must have."
4,Fighting for life,"This, in my oppinion, was slightly better then the first book. This story tells of her trip back to camp after her first year of remission. Everything seems to be going fine, but when she gets home, she relapses. Her doctor tells her that she must have a bone marrow transplant but even with that she only has a 50/50 chance of living. She struggles to stay alive while being locked up in insolation, living only because of her strong will power to live. This book makes sure you will want to read the other three books in the series."
1,Disappointed,It was very disappointing when my daughter opened the package and found two sets of dough hooks and no beaters! I hadn't kept the packaging it came in and now don't know what to do. It's obviously a factory error.
3,And for a 3rd time...Snazzy!,The more work that they REQUIRE for a review makes for a lower score because this is getting to be WORK!
4,Good quality strap,This strap is comfortable and looks like it will hold up well. I'd say it's just long enough for a bass if you don't wear it too low. The same goes for guitars. If you like long straps look elsewhere.
2,"A little disappointed, but good all the same...","First off, I have to say that Paula Volsky is one of my favourite authors. I absolutely loved ""The Grand Ellipse,"" and I enjoyed ""The White Tribunal.""After shelling out $20 at the local B&N for the trade paperback, though, I feel a little cheated. The story is interesting, and Volsky's graceful, descriptive style makes ""The Gates of Twilight"" a good enough read. However, there is absolutely no character development (that I can see, anyway). I found it hard to really like the main characters, or care what happened to them. The two main characters never really grow as people, and the romance just kind of popped up--it feels like it was there only because it was expected of Volsky.That being said, I suggest for those set on buying this novel to get the mass-market paperback...or if you just want to read it, pick it up in the library. It's good, but I prefer ""The Grand Ellipse."""
1,huge dissapointment,my 9 year old son who is a natural athlete got this for Christmas & he became so frustrated trying to use this that he gave up and it has been sitting in our shed for over a year. I gave it 5 stars for durable because he was never able to use it so it never wore out ! We had to hold him while he tried to stand on it to get going but that was even impossible. Would NEVER recommend this toy !
2,"Sadly, overly polished and slow.","Although I am a long time fan of Mountain Heart, I was disappointed in the pace and scope of this album. I was looking forward to a great bluegrass album, and instead found a CD full of new acoustic country ballads and one or two average bluegrass songs. Overall the choice of songs seems to me to be a bit hit driven and country in flavor. It's over produced and overly polished.I respect these men as musicians, and will continue to buy albums and support them as best as I can, but I hope their next album is a little more traditional and hard driving. Don't get me wrong, there is NOTHING wrong with experimentation, and there is certainly nothing wrong with striving for a well produced album, but great albums need it balance...to much polish and you cover up the heart and soul of Mountain Heart."
3,incorrectly described but nice,"Description indicated ""not ex-""lib"" but stamped ""CHAFFEY COLLEGE LIBRARY"" on the title page. Otherwise I am pleased, for the price not bad."
5,A Great Read,"Rick Braggs fascinating and colorful story of the Grandfather he never knew is one of the finest non fiction books I have ever read. His Grandfather was a whisky drinking brawler, moonshiner, and father in Alabama during the great depression. The book is about courage, strength, devotion, honor, and love. Braggs Grandfather had these attributes and more. How he kept his family together while struggling to put food on the table, and the legacy he left behind to his family is what this book is all about.Highly Recommended"
3,"Good for the home, not for the camp.","While this book is a good sit-down read, I wouldn't recommend it for reading out loud to friends while camping. The title dosen't quite fit."
3,This Is Your Time: Empowering Today's Financial Advisor,"The book is good for the lesser experienced. It's applicable to the seasoned financial professional, but isn't meant to be earth-shattering. The seasoned professional will benefit from it as a reminder of how ethical advisors should treat their clients and their business. And considering the last 2-3 years, it's clear that some need reminding."
1,This sucked,This product was so lame. It's only a few pages and it doesn't really help you learn to play accordian. I was very unhappy with the book. Was not what i expected. Lame Lame Lame!!!!!!
5,Kids love it. Excellent.,"Thank you, thank you, thank you. Though a challernge to find this small studio release, we tracked it down after hearing so much positive feedbac k from friends and teachers. We researched further and found great reviews in Scholastic's Parent & Child, Dr. Toy, National Parenting Center and other similar orgs.My kids agreed, as they loved the songs, dancing, exercises, and watching other kids on-screen while learning.Do yourself, and your kids a favor, and pick up Lots To Learn (I think they only have two DVDs right now) It was really good."
2,Quality Control Lacking,We sent this table back due to the fact that the holes to put the table together did not line up properly. The manufacturer obviously has quality control problems - if all the pieces are drilled on a jig they should all align properly.
2,Omg Waaay too Salty...,"Okay, I just had my first pack of these anchovies today, and I must say these things are waaaaaaaay too salty! Jesus Christ I've never tasted anything so salty in my life! I probably don't know that much about anchovies, but seriously, I don't think they are supposed to be THIS freaking salty. I mean these are so salty that I was puckering up! I even wanted to puke at times! I couldn't even finish the whole can because it was just too salty. Now don't get me wrong, these are defintely good quaility anchovies, very tasty, not too fishy and I loved the oil they came in. But I wish they sold a version with reduced salt... I don't want reduced salt because I'm some kinda health nut or something...I want reduced salt because it would taste 10 times better!"
5,Well made......,"Hollywood capitalized on the acting talents of DeNiro & Streep by uniting them for this wonderful, well made & clean film. DeNiro & Streep play Frank Raftis & Molly Gilmore, two people who first meet by chance & then by choice. There's only one problem between them - they are both married. It's a genuine dilemma that they face. With a fine supporting cast & an excellent Dave Grusin score, Falling in Love is a winner all the way !"
4,"A beautiful, quiet, film that lingers","Although the story felt somewhat slight while I was viewing it, this film has stayed with me as it has a kind of indescribable quality. Perhaps that's because ""Falling in Love"" is less about infidelity and more about the overwhelming feelings the two main characters have for one another and how, against their better judgement, neither can ignore these emotions. Moreover the production is augmented considerably by the talents involved as well as some wonderful Dave Grusin music (the main theme, ""Mountain Dance,"" is available on Grusin'sCinemagicrelease). Not an out-n-out classic, but certainly a well-intentioned, well-made, mature look at the vagaries of the human heart."
3,dvd,I have not received it yet. But I will let you know when I receive it. It looks like a very good movie.
5,Falliing in Love,A movie that will make you think what love will really make you do. Add a little serandipity to it and you're hooked.
4,old favorite,I love the story; it's a tearjerker for me. Meryl is one of my faves and De Niro has great rapport with her in this movie. Seeing the fashions from the 80'a is always fun too :)
4,works well,"Mounted easily and securely to my dashboard with only minor disassembly required.I had to remove an air vent, drill a few pilot holes, and screw the bracket in. Then I replaced the air vent. Overall a fairly simple procedure."
2,Java,The book is not very useful. The author jumps between Java versions but never covers all of the new features Java 5.0 has to offer.
3,Very cute and decorative,"This colander is definitely cute and decorative, and goes with our new stainless appliances well. I needed a colander that I can leave out most of the time because we use it regularly, so wanted it to match our kitchen ... and it does so nicely. Only one issue, it is a bit flat or even convex at the bottom, so traps a small amount of water without letting it escape. I think that it warps a little when they weld the bottom support on it."
2,Not the best choice,"I needed a colander and like the cherry design. Unfortunately, there aren't really enough holes to allow for quick draining. I'm keeping it but if I knew before I ordered it that it wouldn't drain quickly, I would not have ordered it."
3,"Different, strange Metheny sounding album.",Definitely a hidden album of Pat Metheny as others suggest. Sounds a bit like Speaking of Now and We Live Here.Good musical talent here but production is hobnob smooth Jazz. Its no surprise I hear these songs in the airport.
4,Master minds at work,"Listening to this cd I am amazed at the variety of talents all on one cd (why one though? I do hope there is a vol 2 in the vaults somewhere) Last month you could have asked me who Cindy Walker was and I honestly didn't have a clue - but listening to all these songs, that I already knew from a variety of artists; the woman bowls me over.Everyone involved on this cd is a master in their own right and the end product is pure joy for the speakers. Their love, and respect, for good music is evident and I am most grateful."
2,The immoral main character kills the enjoyment of the book,"The writing is great, but the main character is so slimy in what she does that it is hard to root for her which is something that makes it difficult to get through. I myself skipped to the end (I've only ever done that 5 times, and I've read hundreds of books)."
2,This book sucked,"I read a lot of chick lit, and this was the worst I've ever read! The main character wasn't someone I could relate with or even like. It was boring and unconvincing."
1,Oddly inspiring,"If you ever had the inkling that you have a novel inside you waiting to get out, let this book be your guiding light. If this author can con someone into publishing her, so can you.This book is, in a word, unreadable. The dreadful reviews here on amazon were written by people like me who tried to get through this overwraught and overwritten garbage. The 5-star reviews obviously were produced by the author's family, friends and publishing house. Don't be fooled. I noticed almost word-for-word duplicates on another bookseller's site. That's a giveaway that they were the work of people with an agenda.""Babyville"" is a much better humorous take on pregnancy. Even ""A Girlfriend's Guide To Pregnancy"" has more laughs than this. Thank heavens I borrowed ""The Thin Pink Line"" from the library and can didn't waste my money."
3,Faking it?,"Jane has decided to keep telling her friends and boyfriend, Trevor, she is pregnant even after the test comes back negative. The only person she can confide in is David, her gay neighbor. At first Jane thinks she can get pregnant and pull it off even if it is delayed a month or two, but that second pink line never shows up (without a pink marker). Soon she is trying to play off her fake pregnancy even late in the game. She even jeopardizes a new love to pull it off.While I thought this book was mildly interesting, I was highly annoyed at the idea of someone faking an entire pregnancy. I wanted to reach through the pages and slap Jane silly. It is definitely not the best of the Red Dress Ink books."
4,A good entertaining book,"I found this book to be highly entertaining, keeping my curiosity in peak mode wondering what Jane was going to do with this bizarre situation she got herself into. I enjoyed the true to life dialogue and characters I could quite relate to the author seems to have done her homework as far as relating how life is in England and their habits and turns of speech.Definitely worth buying if you want an amusing,unusual reading experience!"
4,The thin pink line,"I must admit that I was initially put off by this book. The heroine seemed unsympathetic, and the setting was too familiar. The energy of the prose impelled me to keep reading, though, and I'm glad I did. The overused setting turned out to be purposeful, as the book developed into both a send-up of chick-lit and a deepening of the genre. The plot's hairpin twists took on the momentum and hilarity of a Marx Brothers movie, and as the heroine navigates them her character grows to meet the presented challenges, until by the end we see her as three-dimensional and oddly endearing. This was a breathless, riotous read, and I was sorry when it was over. Warning: Don't read this book on the subway, as I tried to do. My guffaws drew a variety of uninvited responses."
4,Good book for your home library,"It is a good book with great pictures. It would have been more useful had we been interested in preparing our dog for shows etc. but that wasnt our intention. We wanted a book with more information about training, food so on."
4,Ideas for All Seasons,"This book is interesting as it has recipes for many types of icing. For eg; Fondant Icing, Royal Icing, Ganache, Buttercream, etc. Not many cake decorating books include different types of icing like this one. Not only that, every cake has Step-by-Step pictures to show how each was done. Apart from Christmas and birthdays, there are also cakes for Asian ethnic celebration (which is so rare in the market). This book is a real jewel!"
5,Brilliant and Ahead of its Time,"Sam Fuller's ""Shock Treatment"" is brilliant, and about 50 years after it was released, apparently still ahead of its time. How anybody can watch this film without appreciating its audacity and brilliance is beyond me. Yes, it is over the top in its drama, and yes, most of the film has all the subtlety of sledgehammer, but it is a masterpiece.I think a subtext of the film is a strong indictment of society itself, with the mental hospital symbolizing greater society itself, specifically that of America in the early 1960s, and quite probably, today as well. It is possible that some people may find the film off-putting because we do not like being told we live in a sick society. If Martin Scorsese thinks the film is brilliant, people deserve to watch it with an appreciative eye, because Scorsese just might know more about good film than anybody else, with the possible exception of Roger Ebert."
3,"Not bad, but not great.",Its exactly what you would expect considering the low price tag. The accuracy was good but the optical clarity was marginal. I also found it difficult to obtain the proper eye relief but with enough fiddling it was obtained. I place this scope on a AR-10 with O.D. green furniture. The color match was very good. I used the scope for on year and quickly replaced it with a Trijicon which is excellent. In summary you should expect a decent scope but don't expect to be blown away.
5,You Have Got To Get To Know This Author!!!!,"I just love Marilyn Meberg. The really cool thing is that I have actually seen her speak several times over the last several years. She is truly an inspiration. If anyone has a right to be down, it would be this woman...but she chooses a life of joy, love, and encouraging the women around her. I own each of her books (At least I think I do), and I have been blessed by them all. I highly recommend this read!!!!"
1,The author makes false assertions with no references!,"As Don Kates has pointed out in his review of Mr. Spitzer's book, the author asserts that firearm murders are committed by nice, ordinary folks who grabbed a handy gun and killed someone in anger! But this is simply false! Criminolgical studies have consistently shown that murderers are NOT, by and large, ordinary folks at all. Far from it. Perhaps 90% of murders committed in the US with a firearm are committed by aberrant citizens with a long record of criminal activity. See Kates & Kleck, The Great American Gun Debate. See also Wright & Rossi, Under the Gun: for numerous citations of criminologic studies which conclude the opposite of what Prof Spitzer is trying to make us believe. He is, of course, perfectly free to believe and to promulgate whatever he wants. This is America. But we have the responsibility to sort fact from fiction when it comes to formulating public policy!"
5,Amazing conclusion to an amazing series.,"J. Michael Straczynski has provided a stunning conclusion to one of the best series in recent comic history. Without giving away anything, all of the loose ends from the beginning of the series are tied up nicely. Brent Anderson also does a great job with the artwork. Rising Stars: Fire and Ash is definitely worth buying (along with volumes 1 and 2 and the collection of shorts)."
3,Maybe I should have bought the previous volumes,"I went to the comic store and was presented with a choice: I could buy the complete hardback of this series for 100 bucks, or buy this volume 3 for around 20. I went the cheap way. Maybe my expectations were built up too high from everything I've heard about this series, but, not having read volumes 1 and 2, this one seems kind of weak. ***spoiler*** Blackmail the government into behaving by threatening to tell the public the truth about the Kennedy assassination? Wouldn't anyone involved in that be dead by now? The Highlander-esque ending kind of guarantees that the story will be a bit melancholy and depressing. Good art and well written, but doesn't work alone, and I'm not really inspired to buy the previous volumes."
1,Not as advertised. Not even close. Stay away.,"This is NOT a Lenmar battery. Lenmar is a brand name with a decent reputation.Whoever makes this battery is ashamed to put their name on it - there is no brand. And its capacity is branded at 1200 ma, which is ludicrous for a battery this size.I am disappointed that Amazon would allow this sort of bait-n-switch to happen.Stay away from these."
3,Lenmar Battery Charger,Does anybody know if I need to get the Lenmar specific charger for this battery or does it work with the Canon battery charger? Thank you!!!!!
3,Help for acid reflux,Did'nt see much help from this product for acid reflux as seen on a natural health foodblog. Of course the makers claims are for sore throat which it MAY be fine for.
2,Not Good.,"It looked cool at first, but through a week of normal use, the outside pouch (which is connected to the poncho itself) got a big tear in it. I doubted the quality of this and when I did a small (not forceful) tug, the tear became much bigger. I do not like this and it is not part of my backpacking system."
3,This book was very unflattering about the sun signs.,"I was very disappointed in this book. I have read many books on the Sun Signs , however it was my fault as I did notnotice in the title the word UNFLATTERING. Now I am donating it to our local Library."
1,Its a Crock,"For the people who lived this,and if you go by the other review and not what really happened,you can be sucked into the hype.Was there a history teacher loved by the town,yes.The woman who stirred up this crap,really beloved him,and when he did not belove her back,she decided to cook his goose.The school took the easy road and ruined his career.She is really behated in this town.the movie showed her getting some support towards the end?Never happened.She did however make a fast buck writeing a pack of lies,selling to liberal Hollywood,and sucking in a bunch of stupid libs who write from there shirtsleve instead of there researching little brains."
5,A Must for the Holidays,Looking for a perfect Holiday gift? This is it. Small and compact but with so much info and fun to read. I now know what to get my college age relatives as well as a gift for the person who has everything. I hope it is the beginning of a series because there is more to Be Safe about than just one book.
4,"An excellent story, you wont want to put it down.","This is one of only two fictional books I have read in the past ten years the other being Clockers by Richard Price. Exercise your imagination, Streiber makes you believe that this story could very well be 'based on real events'. Good entertainment."
5,A truly excellent recording of wonderful music,"From beginning to end, this CD is brilliantly performed. I would recommend this highly to anyone, not just those interested in early music."
3,Good book on ancient history.,"This is a very good book discussing the origins of mankind in the past. Unlike many books of this genre it actually has an index and I have yet to find any messed up paragraphs, pages or text. The author and editor actually book everything into a clear and concise book. I have read Childress and many others who could learn from this book. Actually have supporting evidence, an index, table of contents and so on in order to keep the reader from burning the book in disgust. This books reads like a pre-historic fairly tale but is logically laid out and goes in a sequential order. The thoughts in this book may be heretical to some but are actually expressed in a thoughtful manner. Very good book, easy to read and is not written in three different sizes of type. Recommended for anyone interested in this type of thing. Do not spend money on some David Hatcher Childress book that has no clear and logical layout. Buy this one instead."
2,Wasn't my Cup of Tea,I could not really get into this book..The beginnin gof the book was a little slow and I couldn't follow it out. I did however hear about the ending of the book and wish that I had followed it through...But usually if books don't grab my attention from the beginning I loose interest. ...
3,While Griffiths' lively exploration offers much to admire and applaud,"I have to say that when I picked up a copy I was surprised to see no mention in it of Robert Grudin's Time and the Art of Living. This memorable meditation on the subject --- really a commonplace book of thoughts centered on time and the human relationship to it --- was first published in 1982, then reissued in 1997. Now it must be found secondhand (here on Amazon or elsewhere).Not ordinarily given to proselytizing, I nonetheless urge both satisfied and dissatisfied readers of A Sideways Look to check it out. You'll discover either a splendid complement to Griffiths's work . . . or else the book you'd hoped she might have written."
5,This book is a key in the door of freedom for investors!,"This is the best book I've read in over a year! The author is a skilled writer with a powerful, useful message. She teaches complex ideas in plain language and is easy to understand. One of the ""ah-ha!"" moments for me was how she helped me see that my fear of understanding finance and investments was because I didn't want to become a cause of human suffering just to make enough to retire comfortably, and that investments in stocks and bonds have traditionally caused companies to focus only on profits (at any cost). She gave me a way to invest with a conscience, and to live my values. I am very grateful, and wholeheartedly recommend this book."
3,flaw in chapter 6,"I was helping a colleague who was using the formula for combining data sets from several sources (chapter 6). When one applies the appropriate weighting factors, the resulting standard deviation, given as 1/sqrt(sum(wi)), comes out a factor of 10 or so too small. If one looks at the definition of the weighting factors, it is clear that the results are off by a factor approximately equal to sqrt(the total number of runs), or more correctly, a weighted function of the total numbert of runs.This discussion is getting far too techical, but suffice it to say that a textbook of this sort, which is likely to be followed verbatum by an average user, should make sure that the formulas give the right results."
5,Music,I heard the album from a friend and loved it. and i wanted to own the original album myself. Get it if you like good music.
1,Duped as well!,I wish my husband would have read the other review before making this purchase! The picture is very misleading. Nylon case was sent while they show the hardwood case - unbelievable! We will never consider purchasing from this company again.
1,BEWARE,"Just want to make everyone aware that the picture doesn't show the actual product that is sent. BEWARE!I bought this as a gift, and it was very embarrassing because what I actually got was a COVER for the wooden case. They should really change the picture for the product, its very deceiving."
1,MISLEADING ADVERTISING,"I am very disappointed. I purchased this item and it turns out even though the picture is of the hardwood box, and the Product description says:'These beautiful hardwood cases are lined with sapphire blue foam backed velveteen. They nestle four batons up to 16"" in length. The Mollard logo is laser engraved on the lid. The case cover is made of black nylon duck and features a carrying handle, a zippered pocket and a soft lining to protect the beautiful finish of the hardwood.'It seems that I have purchased a nylon case cover which is not even pictured and only talked about as what sounds like an additional item! And I am told that I will have to put out 75 dollars more to get the hardwood box!I am going to send this back and get my money back and never do business with this company again!Dragonladytls"
5,"This is classic, quintessential, Southern Gospel singing.","True to form, the Statesmen set the standard for this type of music in the early 1950s. For example, the tenor, Denver Crumpler, and the bass, known as the Big Chief (you guessed it -- a Native American), have yet to be out done by today's performers. And the group's rythym is superb! Given the fact the first half of this cd is mono, not stereo, they have fully outperformed just about all modern gospel quartets."
5,Undesputed #1 Quartet,"Who would have ever thought after over 40 some years, The Statesmen would still have a loyal following, But I have been a fan of theres from the very first time I seen them on stage, and over the years I have collected every album of there's except for one, that some how was lost ,It was the Black album and what I can remember of it, one of the songs on it was called ""Wade On Out "" I would love to find that album again. I just wish that someone would remaster all of the albums and put them on CD I WOULD BUY THEM ALL OVER AGAIN"
4,NEVER PLAYED IT.. I HATE PS2 I SWER!!!!,NEVER PLAYED THIS TITLE BUT I WANNA HEY THEY SAY NO RING NO REF BUT IS IT HAS FUN AS A WWE GAME I THINK NOT... ANYWAYS I HATE PS2 IT SUCKS I USED TO LIKE IT BUT IT BROKE ALL MY FRIENDS PS2'S BROKE AND X-BOX HAS WAY BETTER GRAPICS EVERY TIME THEY PUT A TITLE PS2 GAME ON A X-BOX THEY HAVE MORE INHASMENTS LIKE BETTER GRAPHICS ON IT AND 2 OR 4 PLAYER ACTION IF THE PS2 VERSION WAS ONE PLAYER X-BOX IS WAY BETTER HEY I THOUGHT X-BOX SUCKED TOO WHEN I HAD PS2 I WAS JUST LIKE YOU BUT THAN THEY GOT THE X-BOX SMALL CONTROLLER AND X-BOX LIVE AND WAY BETTER GAMES AND MORE INHASMENTS FOR OTHER TITLES IT WENT OVER THE TOP OF PS2 TRUST ME!
1,Ridiculous!!!!,"Never in my life have I ever wanted to play a game for so long, and then when I finally get to play it, I throw my controller against the wall in disgust. Not because I lost a match or anything like that, just because the game is that bad. I'm actually contemplating finding the people who made this game and punching them in the mouth. Horrible graphics, terrible controls and tiny fighting areas make this game horrible. And the characters are always running. What the F**K!!! This game is pathetic. I wish I could give it a negative rating, or that by some mistake Eidos sent a whole shipment, I'd say about 10 million, of this game to my house, so I could spend the rest of my life smashing them into various items and places around my house. Thats all the game is good for, nothing more."
2,Great idea - poor sound quality,"Sure, you gotta love Starz and the idea of a live cd from back in their heyday was attractive enough to get me to buy this. But, buyer beware!What we have here are cuts from a handful of different concerts (the band gets introduced a few times) and the quality of the recordings vary quite a bit. The good news is that the performances absolutely demonstrate the raw rock energy any Starz fan would want to experience, unfortunately the overall sound quality is really poor and pretty much kills my enthusiasm for this cd.Bottom line, there's nothing here that would make this my first choice whenever I'm in the mood to listen to some Starz - that'll still be Violation!"
3,Good Book,"I liked this book; it provides helpful suggestions for dealing with criticism in mainly business environments. However, I found ""Criticism Management"" by Randy Garner to more effectively handle criticism situations in both work and home. Both books offer great insight; however Garner's text offers some great quotes, great learning tools, and a section that hit me personally---dealing with criticism at home."
5,Incredible!,"I looked through all the reviews here too...and I have to say this book is WONDERFUL! I am pretty new at all of this. And like so many people new to the health industry, it can be really confusing. I went through this book with no problem! I keep it by my side all day long. I consult it for proper form, and nutrition. I find the exercise programs that are set up in the book are well balanced and don't leave me feeling lost. I didn't need to go out and buy a ton of new exercise tools. I simply dusted off what I already had. (And frankly after reading all the reviews...who really cares about the spelling and grammar mistakes!!)I wasn't intimidated by this book.I wasn't lost.I WAS/AM empowered.I WAS/AM excited.I finally feel as if I have THE tool to help me take control of all that I need to achieve my goals."
4,Equipment,This is a fabulous reference if you have access to expensive gym equipment. If not try another book because you won't be able to do the exercises anyway.
4,It really works!,"I have worked out and dieted on and off for years, but this is the first routine that showed immediate results. All I did was follow the workout routines, not even the eating plan or the meditation exercises. And after each two week cycle, I had lost inches!"
5,Best book on weight training for women,"This book beats everything else that's on the market on weight training for women. Great that it addresses beginners as well as advanced athlets, also it is incredibly motivating. It helped me at a point when I was stuck with my training and didn't get the results I wanted anymore. The exercises are very well explained and illustrated, so there's no excuse not to get started!"
2,Slightly entertaining,"I bought this without seeing it first and was disappointed. The story is about a snowflake who gets to ice skate (the adventure). I had hoped for something more informational on snowflakes, and I also thought the interaction with the 'mean' snowflake to be silly and unnecessary."
3,Works well,Bought these to use against the sun. They will be splendid. Fit the kids hands easily and store away nicely in the glove compartment.
3,Not stronge enough,"If a beautiful big fan, but unfortunatly the plastic bar brake easily with just one or two snap. So buy more the one is you need it for a performances."
1,Not happy,"This fan is too big I don't think that anybody who has to perform would want to with this large fan, it's larger than stated and heavy not a good buy,and you are responsible to pay to ship it back and if you want a replacement you have to pay for that too...."
2,an okay game,"for what this game lacks in graphics it makes up in story and characters. i like the fact you can get broly and his cool special atack, but others are all wrong. like krillins head looks like an oversized bowling ball.(android 18 too!) atleast krillin uses his huge head for an attack. overall it's an okay game. buy it if you have nothing better to buy."
3,Not bad but too easy,"This is a decent game overall, but the main thing that bothers me is that it is far too easy to finish. I finished the game a a couple of times in a just a few hours, on the first day that I bought it. I also did not like the fact that your opponents do not get progressively more difficult to beat the further you get into the game. The final opponent is hardly more difficult than the rest. Also the fighting in the air is quite pointless since all you need to do win everytime is move the pad around and quickly push a bunch of buttons. It takes not strategy or skill what so ever.On the up side though, the graphics are good the super moves are fun, it has some interesting features and the characters are pretty faithful to the show. I would say buy it if you are a DBZ fan and like fighting games, but don't expect challenging and sofisticated gameplay."
2,"Not That Well Written, Only Good as a Reference","Was expecting a book that really helps fairly new readers to the concepts of financial engineering. This book is not well written and throws the reader into a lot of topics without any real-world, practical examples. A much, much, much, better book is Investment Science by Luenberger. Get that book. It kicks Hull's ass."
5,Fantastic,this album is not to be missed.....I first heard it on NPR and immediately got online to make a purchase. Will not dissapoint!
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!,"this game is horrible. the graphics are bad. the physics of the game are bad. the tracks are slow and boring. the only good things about this game are the price and the cars. i'd recommend buying something else. unless this game is less than $5, i'd avoid it"
4,"Great info, not sure I'd play poker with them...","These cards are a great resource to learn edible plants in North America. That said, their use as playing cards is limited, as the field photo of the plant is on the card back - the printed side does have a suite and number, but once you learn that 6 of Spades is a Dandelion, for instance, the game is a bit ruined."
1,A Writer You Can Easily Compare to Various Other Writers,"The vastly overpraised Klosterman weighs in on various women friends and girlfriends while riffing on Led Zep, Sid Vicious, cocaine, and other hipster-oriented topics. As in his earlier books, he has a Camille Paglia-like tendency to make completely indefensible pat assertions. He's mildly amusing, sort of like Dave Barry with a post-baby-boomer's taste in music. And his capacity for self-absorption does make it easy to dismiss him as a male Elizabeth Wurtzel. This book should be bought used as cheaply as possible or borrowed from your local library. It's not worth the price of admission."
5,Disgaea hour of darkness,This game is really good for ps2 and one of good anime seris that is named that title and it has great gameplay and it has good story...
5,Where do I start...,This game is a great game. I found through-out the entire game no flaws. It is perfection at perfect. The story is endless...the characters are endless...the levels are endless...even charcter building where you can get to level 999 and believe me there are enemies at 999. This has to be the most creative game I've laid eyes upon. This gama is FLAWLESS. If you don't buy this one it will be a regretful decision you'll have to live with for the rest of your life.
4,Not bad,"Alanis Morissette's second album is definitely an improvement over her self-titled (minus the Morissette) debut. Now is the Time still features corny love songs like Big Bad Love and Rain, but the album also features a more mature side of Alanis. Songs like No Apologies and (Change Is) Never a Waste of Time are a little more introspective and her singing is great. While nothing can compare to Morissette's Jagged Little Pill masterpiece, she was certainly heading in the right direction with Now is the Time. An enjoyable listen!"
4,a solid workmanlike book,"This is a solid, workmanlike scorebook, concentrating on the fundamentals. I particularly like the fact that it is printed on good quality paper, adding to the sensuous pleasure of the experience. I give it four rather than five stars simply because the only perfect scorebook would be one I designed myself, and it would only be perfect for me. Scoring baseball is such a personal, idiosyncratic activity that no two people want exactly the same book. For example, I like having space to track each hitter's count. This is not included here, though there is enough room to fake it. Instead there are boxes for each hitter to mark an out or an RBI. To my thinking this is a poor use of space, as these are derived from the main scoring space. These are nits, however. Short of designing and printing your own, this is a good a book as you are likely to find."
1,Not What It Suggests,"I bought this book along with others, and this one, by far, disappointed me the most because I had read its rec's on amazon. I feel like it is not up to date on my things that I find dificult about finding myself a more appropriate job. Though it says that it is the 20th anniversary edition, I kept feeling as though the book was still 20 years behind the times. Make of the book what you will, but there are better ones out there."
2,bit overpriced,"Thought this would work looking at picture of it's sturdy craftsmanship, but the middle hole cutter slips out when using it unless you turn it counter clockwise as you are cutting- can only be used as a circle cutter, don't advise getting this to make donuts, especially since there are less expensive versions out there that actually work!"
2,won't stay together,"The center cutter will NOT stay in place and falls out everytime you cut a donut. I was disappointed because the item was nice sturdy stainless steel, heavier duty than cheap tin cutters. But, it is not usable for donuts."
1,Intel has done it!,Intel has done it now! They are the top in LAN. For me there has always been only 3com but now i think twice before buying anything but INTEL..
5,Yum,"Smells great and I get so many compliments on it. Makes the whole room smell like flowers, and its very strong, so i try to use it sparingly."
3,Not in love with it,I was looking for a clean fragrance and I saw a lot of people recommended Eternity. It must not work with my body chemistry because I just do not like the scent of it. It reminds me of what an elderly woman would wear. I'm going to give it to a friend.
4,Good seal,"Replaced seal on front door with this. Good seal. Expect average durability.If you like to hunt, you might find this at Lowes or Home Depot."
4,Great product-wish it had an Off/On switch instead of unplugging,"Love it...now we can have hot water for coffee, tea, oatmeal, etc...without buying the expensive hot water tap. Works great, heats up water quickly. Keeps it warm as long as you want. The only thing I could wish for is an on/off switch...but you have to unplug it if you want to turn it off. There is an on/off switch on the top, but this is strictly to turn off the ability to use the pump. But it is very convenient to use. Plug it back in the next morning and water heats up again quickly."
3,Mediocre quality,"I used this hot water pot for about two years (mostly during winter time). The electric dispenser stopped working after over a year, and the manual pressure dispenser stopped in about two years. So two years it is, the life span."
1,Dean,I bought 2 of these. 1 from Amazon and the other from local retail store. I have had to throw it away with 1 yrs of use. It gets all yellow inside and starts to smell like burnt. The stainless steel inside changes color to yellow. It appears burnt and you can really smell the burnt everytime you open the lid. I know better to buy a higher quality product next time.
5,A tea lover's must for Shabbat and everyday,"Having grown up in a household with a hot water tap, I'm used to having near-boiling water available at all times - except on Shabbat, when, a rabbi told my mother, the tap could not be used (years later, a different rabbi, who had a different understanding of how the technology worked, told me it is permissible!). So once I was on my own, some sort of urn or electric pump pot was a must. I bought this one to replace an old one that died, and am pleasantly surprised by the new features, including the instant dispense button and switch (although they can't be used on Shabbat either, as they make a light go on, but you can still pump out water by pressing the original spot), and the concave front, which allows your cup or teapot to nestle up close. The price is right, the unit works, and my only concern is that I'll run out of water before Shabbat is over! In fact, I just bought another one as a Mother's Day gift and presented it today (now it can be told!)."
5,extremely calming,"A compilation of soothing, calming and even spiritual piano compositions. close your eyes and breath relax and feel the emotions played out in every key. Buy them both!"
3,Good enough - if you own other copies,Marred by weird staging in the second act ( where the flowers are depicted and nude women and men who fondle Parsifal -ugh); Decker also apparently forgot his lines in two parts and changes the dialogue; and the timpany player was asleep in the third act and missed his cue during the transformation scene creating a weird effect for those who know the opera. But still it's Parsifal and almost any version is great. But it if you have three other versions.
5,Once you started to read it you won't want to put it done!!!,It is such a good book that I bought it. This book contains everything and a lot more that a book should have. It is suspenseful to see what will happen next. Patricia Vaughn is an excellent writer and I too hope she will make a series. Thank you for writing this beautiful book. Karaak
4,Great Read,"I liked this book very much. The history lesson is wonderful. We learn about the Placee system and Creole society and their attitudes. I was already aware of this because I am a history buff. It was a great read. I did not give it five stars because I had a few problems with the writing and story telling. The reasons are the reason I rarely read romance novels unless they are written by someone who has eliminated some of the ridiculous adjectives that add a level of cheesiness.I disliked Roget very much. He was such a wimp to me. He did not do justice to Lauren until late. The emotional abuse was hard for me. However, I know such abuse is a part of some women' lives. His abuse of her was all emotional from neglect. I wasn't that fond of Lauren either. However, the fact that I did not care that much for the main characters did not distract from the great story generally.I googled Ms. Vaughn and I can't find her anywhere. This book needs to be re-issued. I highly recommend."
1,Short Lived,"Had 3 of these for different rooms in the house, and despite very little use, they now all have the same mechanical failure: The cd lid no longer shuts. It springs upward rendering the cd player useless and the whole unit an eyesore because the lid is up in the air. Other reviews I've looked at online also speak of it's very short life. At the time I'm writing this, it says ""unavailable"" here on Amazon - let's hope it stays that way!"
4,replacement power supply,"This is the exact power supply and worked perfectly right out of the box. This is a great time saver for parents who spend hours looking for something that their children lost.When the power supply had been missing for a month, and my son was in tears as he could not find it, a quick Amazon search and the new one was on the way. It was here and the PSP was working again.Thanks Amazon"
1,"horrible, mine not even by pelican.",what i recieved was a horriblely made piece of chinese equipment. It was not made by pelican. To make things worse the plug that goes into the wall does not stay in the wall. It looks like it will catch my house on fire. do not buy this item. i will be cotacting the seller
5,Works!,"I used this AC adapter to power my Belkin wireless router because I lost the original adapter. Since this was the only 5 V 2000mA adapter I could find, I thought I would give it a shot. It doesn't fit perfectly (but it wasn't designed for my product...) but it sure as hell does work!"
2,Not like original Corningware,"This item is not like the original CorningWare. A company called World Kitchens bought the rights to the CorningWare name and uses it on stoneware products. The product is made in China, not Corning, NY. My real complaint is the limited utility of the dishes. A sheet that comes with the dishes warns not to use them under a broiler, under a microwave browning element, in a toaster oven, or any other direct heating source. Obviously, they can't be used to make creme brulee."
4,"Good and concise, but a little outdated.","I read this book in a translation to the portuguese, here in Brazil.It's concise, fun to read and good about this subject.The problems in this book are small, but they exist.One of these problems is that this book is a little outdated.To exemple, it teachs that Jim Bakker got tens of years in prision.Correct when this book was writen, but Jim Bakker was relased from jail some years later."
3,Mysterious secrets,"Shane a 30 year old attorney best friend Leslie is murdered in the City of Memphis where they both lived. Shane and Leslie had a secret between them for 20 years. They promise never to tell. Even after Leslie's death, Shane kept their secret until the secret could not be hidden any longer. Who killed Leslie? Who is raping the schoolgirls in Memphis? These are the questions that has to be answered in this novel. The author did a great job of keeping you in suspense and making you read to the very end to find out the answers. Though there were little incidents to throw one off track if they thought they had the answer. This novel was a good start for this new author. With experience I think book two will be much better."
1,Tainted Waters,This book is so poorly written and edited that I can't believe you're even making it available to Amazon customers.
1,Will not save more than one game,"After trying the 2002 version I couldn't wait to receive thenewer online version. I was never planning to actually useit online.Here's the rub: several people at the house would like to useit, but the game will only allow one game to be saved on theHD. I bought an Xbox memory card hoping that it wouldsolve the problem, but it doesn't. You cannot transfer a gamefrom the hard drive to the memory card! For us this was verydisappointing, and makes the game all but useless."
1,There are issues with this book.,"I bought this book when I still believed that the apparitions in Medjugorje were true.I think that this book contains lies. For example this book gives the story of an American farmer who spends everyday 5 minutes at church. One day he gets sick and Jesus comes to visit him. In the French version of a book by Sister Emmanuel, ""Medjugorje, the 90's"", there is almost EXACTLY the same story, but in her case it is a homeless man in Paris. Almost all the details are the same! My guess is that someone in the Medjugorje team made up this story that was used and adapted for different languages and countries. I would not trust any word from this book or from other Medjugorje books.The apparitions of Medjugorje have been condemned by both Msgr Zanic and his successor Msgr Peric, bishops of Mostar, who have authority over Medjugorje.I really recommend to take the challenge of learning more about the hidden side of Medjugorje by reading as many articles as possible.(...)"
2,Not all solos,"Don't be fooled by the clever marketing PR which neglects to mention that at least half of these recordings are not solo guitar performances. There is bass, violin, synthesizer and maybe a second guitar on some of the tracks. So, you'll never get your playing to sound like the recording. Time: about 47 minutes"
1,Empty Pretend-Fairy-Tale,"A newborn is abandoned in the woods to be raised by a community of cuddly forest animals. Animalkind has a prophecy telling of such a child, who will one day grow to be a savior. Though the writing was not bad, the story was pathetic, as was the character development. The young hero Nab lives in the woods and talks to animals, which is neat for kids, but trite for everyone else. Except for a tiny percentage, humans are portrayed as black-hearted murderers. After their forest home is destroyed by Men, Nab and his furry pals embarks on a quest to fulful an empty objective. This book pretends to be a happy fairy tale about friendship and goodness, etc. But really it's about how horrible people are, and how we deserve to die for our mistreatment of animals. Look elsewhere for touching fairy-tales. Anyone looking for profound fiction about the treatment of animals might want to read DOCTOR RAT, by William Kotzwinckle instead."
2,mindless occasional laugh,"It reads like stories swapped in a bar with your girlfriends, and I think that's the intention. This book was amusing enough for me to keep going, but not a gut-buster. Notaro's revelations are pretty obvious, some of the laughs are forced, and she's tiresome when she rants about how pathetic she is.She has some good moments, like when she takes revenge on a guy who stood her up, or when she recommends Norplant to the white-trash girls up the street, and I liked her attitude to her high school reunion. Not everyone can walk into that classically neuroses-making situation with a truly ""the hell with it"" attitude.It isn't deep, but it never pretends to be. Maybe I'm a bit out of the age range for this book...I'll try her latest book and see if I relate better."
5,"Not an Idiot Girl, still loved it!!","I have never had the guts to be a true Idiot Girl. I admit it! This fantastic read let me peer into what I missed, the good and the bad.Laurie is frank and brutally honest. You'll love it."
5,Laurie is the Cat's Pajamas,"No doubt about it, this book is by far one of the most hilarious things I've ever read. Like so many other people, I was laughing so hard I nearly fell off the sofa and probably scared the holy hell out of my husband (in the end, he read it, too). For anybody who loves a good book about the dork in all of us, this one is it."
3,"Great, lighthearted, fun read!","I picked up this book based on the cover and the title. I read the first page while sitting in the book store, immediately bought it and ran home to read it. My only apprehension about the book was that it appeared to be a collection of short stories, which I hate, because I'm always disappointed when they're over.I don't think i've ever laughed out as much as I did while reading Notaro's stories. I love her dry sense of humor and candid story-telling. The only disappointment I felt while reading this book was when I got to the last page-- I didn't want it to end."
5,Great stuff,I am very grateful for this book because now I can dump the old moldy columns printed on the [poor quality] paper that The Planet and Java used back in the mid-90's... I was a Notaro fan back from the Planet days. I even once sent her a tin of sewer roaches (a Korean delicacy) in appreciation. But I am sure the next book'll be better because there's still a lot of columns I had to keep that were better than the ones included in this first book. The first book actually is made up of columns from Planet and Java and doesn't even tap into the AZ Republic years. ...
5,Hilarious!!,"I have read a couple other books by Laurie Notaro and each one is equally funny. Her stories are witty and cunning, even if some of them might not be true! Very funny book, recommend it to anyone and will continue to read her work."
5,Love this book,I am very satisified with the book I got it was wrapped in bubble wrap to stop any damage I also got it in a very timely manner I would defiently order from this company again.
2,Really? What a Let-Down,"After all the hype and friends' recommendations, I figured I would adore this book - the dry sense of humor, self depreciating jokes and slightly off-color topics sounded right up my alley. What I ended up reading was a thinly-veiled diary of a self hating, chain smoking (current? previous?) alcoholic, filled with a lot of ""You Had To Be There"" stories.Notaro's most successful when reminiscing about her family, but even those you can't count on 100%. You can tell the effort was there when this was being written, the product just falls way short and reveals how hard she had to try to be funny. I'll stick with Sloane Crosley from here on out."
4,great,"This was a great read on the History in Orangeburg, SC where I am a student at South Carolina State University."
4,Short and Sweet,"Though not as thorough and extensive in detail as ""Shark Liver Oil"", which I highly recommend, this book offers great insight into the unbelievable healing powers of the shark. Shark liver oil has only recently begun to be taken seriously as a powerful healer amongst medical professionals. Books like ""Shark Liver Oil"" and ""Devour Disease"" help to bring to light the extensive range of healing this ""wonder"" oil has. If you are one whom is prone to illness, suffering from something severe like cancer, or just want to fend off those all too common colds, shark liver oil is for you, and so is this book!"
5,A Gem of British Folk Music,"When I buy albums from small labels or underrepresented bands such as this one, I don't expect to find any music that amazes me. This album was an exception. There are tracks here that are well written, produced, and (dare I say of an indie band) catchy. For a band aiming for the sounds of folk supergroups of the 60s/70s, I shouldn't be surprised.For me, these two songs make this album a must buy: ""Come Write Me Down"" & ""Want To Know You."" Everything else is a wonderful addition and it really makes it worth the $15 I paid for it. Give a quick listen to the tracks if you don't believe me."
5,Loved it!,"I normally solve mystery stories within the first couple of chapters. Not this one. There were so many twists and turns that it kept me guessing until the very end. The story was sweet, romantic, and managed to surprise me. Highly recommended."
5,"Love, love, love",Such an amazing singer. So glad I found the CD. I looked every where and almost gave up. I checked here and ta-da there it was!
2,Gave up after two tries!,"I purchased this toaster because it looked really nice and I like the dials in the front. I already had a Black & Decker toaster and really liked it, so it was a no-brainer. This toaster didn't toast evenly on both sides, so I returned it to Amazon for a replacement. The replacement didn't toast any better. Returned it and purchased the Cuisinart CPT-160 Metal Classic 2-Slice Toaster which works perfectly."
4,A nice toaster - 4.5 stars!,"If this was just a contest on looks, this toaster would win hands down. It looks great, is just the right size and makes any kitchen look spiffy. It toasts pretty well, even with bagels, although it can run a little hot some days and not so hot others. Opt for keeping it on the light side, just in case."
3,Good harness,"I installed this on my 2001 dakota, both concectos plug in fine , but it was missing the ground pin. no big deal for me, i have been doing deck installs for 15 years. For this truck there is a ground wire on the back of the factory deck's chassis."
1,Snake Oil,"I saw Carman on TBN and decided to buy this album, and I have never been so disappointed. His television image is one of humility, piety, and love for God. I really believed Carman's music could be a positive force in my life after seeing him perfrom on TV. However, this album reeks of egotism, homosexuality, white supremecy, hard-nosed communism, and celebration of Nazi torture methods."
1,Trash,"Could I just start off by saying that this is the reason Amish people live happily : they don't have to subject themselves to this kind of lousy television. What were thinking when they created this?? All I unfortunately have to say is, thank God for books."
3,Ghost Recon without back-up.,"This game is pretty basic. Imagine Ghost Recon without any other soldiers on your side. You have a fair choice of weapons but no spiffy toys like, night vision or infrared devices. You have to recognize your weapons by a small picture to know what you are using, though it doesn't really make a difference. The sniper rifle is useless as well as one silenced HK5. The story just kinda drops you into play with no intro and you slowly piece things together although after completing the game I am still a little fuzzy! But if you like straight tactical combat you should like this. The cover system is not what I expected but decent. And the AI is nothing special. Fairly short game with about 12 hours to complete."
2,groupie love,ignore the 9th groupie. you can tell from his reviews that he a jl groupie. this cd aint that tight. cuz must be the pr man for justus league. it got like ten songs and half of them are boring. get the first murs and 9th wonder cd because that one is better. and dude is dead wrong big pooh is wack as joe scudda is. get off there nuts.
4,Great Read,"Mallory Heart was spoiled, selfish and didn't really know that much about life in the real world. In walks Ellis Carson, a man who made his own way in the world.Ellis touches Mallory in a way no other person has ever done. I think helps her realize you have to communicate and trust another person. Mallory doesn't really know about real love, because she was never shown real love by her mother Justine. Mallory only knew about revenge and playing hard ball. This was a wonderful story and I am glad Ms. Mason softened Mallory. When she was first introduced in her cousin Cole's story, I didn't like her at all. The only bad thing I can say was it was too short. Hopefully, the next Heart's story will be longer."
5,Mallory Heart finally gets her man!,"Okay, I really disliked Mallory, but she really grew on me. Ellis Carson is a man that would not lay down for any woman, especially a woman like Mallory Heart. Mallory did not take to kindly when a man does not do as she says, that in itself is something totally new to her. Mallory and Ellis is something else together, I loved it. Another great read by Mason!"
3,Why the rush?,"This book was ok, but it would have been better if Ms. Mason had taken her time with it. I felt that the story was too short and it seemed as if she just rushed through it without really developing the characters. Mallory was a real witch and it would have been very interesting to see how Ellis was going to bring her around to the kind of heroin I am used to reading about. I think Ms. Mason should have gone a little deeper into what made her the way she was. But I liked Ellis and his partner Bailey. It would be nice to read about Bailey's story somewhere down the line. I didn't get a chance to read Cole's story yet but I will soon. Hopefully, the rest of the Heart's series will be fully developed characters and interesting storylines."
3,Over Before You Get Started,Ms. Mason seemed in a rush to get this book finished. She should have taken more time to develop the storyline.
4,Lots of Music choices,"This Cartridge has many songs from the 60's and the 70's, but it would be nice to just have a cartridge of one decade at a time like just the 50's, 60's, 70's ect.."
5,It Makes Holes!,"What can you say, it cuts holes and does that well. It hasn't gone dull in about 30 uses on sheet metal. Talk to me in a few years and we'll see it it's still in use or in the scrap barrel."
1,poor description of item,i ordered two of these because i figured it wasn't super big but i was shocked when it got delivered and the 29.98 only includes 4 squares!! bottom line - if I had known this i would of purchased a different one.. product itself is plastic - nothing special being that you get 4 pieces of plastic for 30 bucks
4,A taste of Philly,I sent these to a friend who has moved from the Philadelphia area where they do not sell TastyKakes. He was surprised and happy and to devour them!
1,When did they get so small,"I live in Philly and love TastyKakes, well that is I used to. Now with the new owner the product is about half the size it used to be. You can't read it but right on the front of the box it says, ""Picture enlarged"". Enlarged? How about doubled in size. Really the cupcakes are now about an inch thick. Guess you have to make your investment back, but why not do what the ice cream company did make a galloon of ice crea 3/4 of a gallon or a pound of coffee 12 oz., not half the size? You can buy a cake for the price of two boxes and get five times the product."
2,disappointing,"MAUVE is a book about the important discovery of dyes from coal tar derivatives. William Perkins was a precocious English lad who joined a respectable chemical company and quickly understood the importance of tars which left permanent colors on fabrics.Unfortunately this serendipitous discovery happens early on in Perkins life; the rest of his life is, so to speak, not colorful. He is not connected, as far as I can see, with any other important discoveries.Garfield begins the book with a drab anecdote about a testimonial dinner. Testimonial dinners are famous for being boring; this one was no exception and unfortunately sets the tone for most of this book."
2,Limited and repetitive songs selection,"I largely agree with Monday Warrior about the repetitive songs selection. Karaoke is not very popular on our side of the Atlantic, but over in Europe and especially Asia, it's extremely popular. As such, there are much more advanced Karaoke mics with large-capacity song chips, record function, USB connectivity for uploading, live video interleaving, etc.Fortunately, globalization these days meant most have been imported and are easily purchasable through local merchants/retailers. Just do a search on Google for ""Magic Sing"" or ""Magic Mic"". Hope this helps."
2,Left a lot to be desired.,"I guess I will be the lone low ratimg for this book. I agree that it was interesting, but it really wasn't that phenomenal. It is basically your usual bible story with a few more personal inner dialogues. It was a horribly slow read even though the chapters were short. It did not even remotely pull me in until the end. Dont waste your time on this one."
5,Good but quite expensive,"These smell good and are good for dog's skin and coat, but they are pretty expensive. The small bag only has enough treats for a little under 2 weeks given twice a day."
5,browning jacket,my husband really loves this jacket! He says that it feels so good;lightweight and waterproof. Thanks for making his day!(probably his year!)
1,Disappointed in Reno,"I'm really into coloring spiritual theme drawings. I hoped this book would offer me a varity of designs on this subject (the name suggests so). Much to my disappointment, the entire book consists of the same pattern on every page, with only minor variations depicting seasonal/elemental details. I felt totally [scammed], and returned the book for refund."
1,would rate even lower,"how do you follow up the two best books you have ever wrote? not by writing something that goes so totally against the grain of the story as this book does. i would say the first two were my favorite Weis and Hickman books, and this one being my least favorite of all. i have read everything written by these two, i dont even see how this made it through their story writing process, nothing in this book other character names even relates tothe greatness of the first two books. steer clear of this stinker, and leave the story as a two book trilogy."
5,Light Cover,"The product is cool. The delivery time was great. The price was great. I wasn't what I was searching for, but for the price, I could not pass it up."
4,One of the best titles ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Age:9 March 9 2004PokebisGo!Go!Hypergrind! is one one of the best games ever!!! Made by Spumco who made Ren and Stimpy. (Well mostly by Spumco) It's not known a lot,but really it's a title. Okay now I'll talk about the game. It's a very funny game espeisly it's moives!!! It has a negateve reaction system were you can get your freaky character indjured for points but I mean indjured by getting your characteres head get chopped off or catch them on fire ect.(No blood) You skateboard in this game. If you fall you don't get any points. When it loads you get to be the instrutor and try to ollie(jump) on a target! Sorry I have a lot more time left I have a lot more to tell you.Grachics 9\10Music 3\10Funny 9\10Negate reaction 10\10Final 10\10P.S. You need to know math!"
2,Is this a Headset? or a Money Vaccuum,"This headseet is a good accessory for going online on popular games such as Socom, Madden and Ratchet and Clank. It feels like a lazy way 4 Sony to make some extra money. Compared 2 the XBOX 1 it is a P.O.S the first time i bought this thing it looked gay so i threw it down in disgust. And it broke so i had to buy a new 1. I barely play with it because i fear i might break it. Hey Sony, heres a tip in the next PS REINFORCE THE STUPID THING WITH FRIGGIN METAL!!!!!!!! Dont just make it a plastic P.O.S!!! Sorry im such a grouch i ve had a long, horrible day and i feel like s#!t Im gonna go play some Halo now on a good headset to relax.-Forwardhaloman ""This PS2 extra cheap third-party s#!t is getting pretty old. Seriously.""-Forwardhaloman"
3,Cheap USB headset,"Yes this product is labeled and intended for use with a PS2, but it can also easily work on your PC or laptop. That's what I use it for, because there really aren't that many PS2 games that people still play online you know? But for the money you really can't beat this headset. Mono speaker would be a negative for some people, but I use this for playing online games on the PC, so I can hear the game with one ear and my teammates in the other. This can be used for Skype type software as well. You can make online phone calls or voice chat or whatever you want to do with a microphone and speaker. One warning: DON'T BEND THE MIC BOOM MUCH. I broke my first one and this is the replacement. :D"
2,Piece of junk..,"Sony must be trying to suck up some cash from people, and they are doing that from me. These things are 30 bucks and I have bought 4 of these and they are just breaking like crazy. I guess it's a good thing i live in a family with money.. but this thing is just a cheap piece of junk that needs some improving.."
2,The Fannie Farmer Cookbook Eleventh Edition,The cookbook came to me on a speedy basis; however it smells very musty.I have used vineger to try to take the musty smell out and it has helped.I am now letting the book be open to 10 pages at a time to air it outI am disappointed with the condition of the used book
1,"Repetitive, Repetitive, YAWN!!!!!!!","Every song I hear from this MUSHSUGER band sound the freakin same. Same notes just in a different order!!!. Thats what happends when u listen to hardcore music you become brainwashed and accept the same crapy music but played backward. This band is the apidimity of Sweds everywhere. If you want real sweadish metal and metalcore try listening to Children of bodom, Inflames, Kalmah, Stratovarious and bands who have melody to them. SEE YA LATER MUSHSUGAR, yidish for untalented."
4,"not their best, but still meshuggah","see, while i give this five stars, this is my least favorite meshuggah album. i couldn't REALLY tell you why, but it's not up to meshuggah's standards. keep in mind, meshuggah is an AMAZING band, and everyone should be listening to them. they're rythms are amazing, their beats intricate, they're just good. if you're a meshuggah fan, i would get this album, but if you're brand new to them, buy something like destroy erase improve."
1,Poor in all respects.,"I had to suffer through this piece of junk for my MBA. I would expect this to be a huge hit with consultants and .edu types - who don't have to stick around to produce measurable long-term results that lead to increased profits.This book was a pile of buzz-words, contradictions (why is the ""edge"" of chaos shown as smooth bell curve? Because 'dancing on edge;' sounds cool) and hip culture. Go ahead and apply it to your business and see what happens...I took the first opportunity to throw it in the garbage as soon as the last hour of class was over."
4,oxford french dictionary for windows,"learning curve a little steep, but essential for those of us over 50 who need a dictionary with print large enough to read."
3,Too complicated for beginners,"I am a beginner of French. This dictionary is not good for beginners. For a single word, there are too many definitions, and not well explained in English. And for some very simple words, such as ""good night"", you cann't find it. I think this dictionary is for more advanced French users.If you were a beginner, I definitely recommend you get a smaller and more compressed version. And it is so heavy, you can't take it anywhere."
3,Too Easy!!,"I pre-ordered this game thinking that it may not be just a kids' game. I was wrong. I beat it in like 3 or 4 hours. The objectives are just too simple, and the bosses are a joke. I only recommend it for kids under 12."
4,Hard forever?,"Some bands definetely wear their formulas proudly for all to see, and Motorhead is one such band. The standard elements that make up their albums are all here----fast, hard, loud, lyrics either about war or S&M or getting blasted out of your skull chemically, topped off with Lemmy Kilminster gargling razorbl----er, singing! What makes this Motorhead album stand out somewhat--SOMEWHAT--are Bill Laswell's larger-than-life production values, which makes songs like ""Deaf Forever,"" ""The Claw"" and the title tune really kick in your head. ""Deaf Forever"" is particularly in the ""put-it-on-and-play-it-again"" catagory--once the opening riff starts up, it doesn't turn loose! Out of Motorhead's mostly sounds-the-same discography, this album stands apart and makes itself heard."
5,I experience so much freedom and peace listening to CeCe.,"CeCe, I thank God for your commitment to him. I know it gets rough in your line of work, but I would like to encourage you to hold your head up very high and know that God loves you very much!I am also encouraged to see how the ""Winans"" stay so close together. Your family has shown a great deal of love for one another. Although, I would love to be a fly on the wall just to see Marvin, BeBe, and the other brothers debate. I bet its funny!Love you guys! Thanks for being a positive role model!T"
3,Good enough,"I love Gloria Estefan's music and own all of her albums. For this reason I bought 90 Millas. The CD is good (enough), but I thought that with such provoking title, it was going to be amazing."
2,"good ""latino music""","I bought this for myself, but ended up giving it to my Venezuelan-born girlfriend. It's all in spanish and I don't speak. My fault. Music is good, but the language turned me off.Angela (my girl) likes it!"
5,Love My Floors Again!,"This system is great. I thought it would be hard to use (spraying and mopping the whole floor), but it was easy and fast. And my floors shine beautifully now. Not a slick waxy looking shine, but enough that my floors look and feel really clean! The stuff is all easy to clean, just throw it in the washer and your ready for the next use! Enjoy!"
4,moccasins,came in a timely fashion. Just what we wanted. Just wished they had been a little bit wider.
5,Mens's Slippers,"Bought these for my husband, he really liked them. Great fit and great quality. Would recommend and purchase this brand again."
5,Comfy and durable,"These slippers are perfect for warm feet around the house and the hard soles allow you to take a quick trip outside (to take out the trash, etc...). Ignore the knuckleheads that gave the slippers 1 star. They're angry about the slow shipping (which is explicitly mentioned in the product description) and are actually rating the seller, rather than the product. These are good slippers."
4,Have two pair,"I have two pair of these at two different houses and love them. Nice and warm. Only negative on my second pair is they tend to run a bit narrow and I wish I had gotten wide like the first pair but was an Xmas gift and there was no stock. They'll break in after a while. Like the fact I can walk outside and get the paper or run to the car with the hardsole which really is more of a soft plastic bottom, not that hard."
2,Pony Express is Faster,"Product arrived as described, but wait time to receive was extremely slow. Delivery took between 2-3 weeks from date of original order. If you don't want to pay for shipping, and delivery time isn't an issue, then this seller is perfect for you. On the other hand, I will probably look elsewhere when purchasing."
3,I didn't like it as much as everyone else,"I bought this perfume based on everyone's reviews and I am not a fan. I much rather prefer D&G 6, Gucci Guilty or even Kim Kardashian Gold over CK Eternity. I've received a lot of compliments on these instead!!"
1,Eternity Perfume is a Fake!!!!,I have worn Eternity perfume for a very long time. I received my order I was very disappointed. This ETERNITY PERFUME IS A FATE. !. It is a amber color.The Eternity that I have wore for years is not this color 2. There are particals of something floating in the perfume. Needless to say I will not be ordering from Eternity perfume this vendor again.
5,Super choice!,"My husband chose this bag for his work computer. It was a gift, and he loves it. It seems very durable and spacious but not overly bulky."
4,"Small book, good information",This book was very quick and easy to read. It gave me some insight into depression from a biblical sense that I hadn't ever thought about before.
2,First episode fell flat as most new BBC shows do.,BBC is no longer about producing quality. Now it's about being trendy and that means having everyone in this show drink like a sot and rut like a hog in estrus. Bloody hell! Are they so terrified of overestimating their audience that that everyone must be the same?
2,"Nice, but very academic","This book is well concieved, but obviously written by someone who has an academic background. The author cites lots of facts and examples, but never really takes the ""how to"" steps I'd expect from someone who has actually done what he's writing about.I'd recommend Blindsided by Bruce Blythe instead. It has a tilt to the human side of crises, but is very well done and includes many practical tips. I've actually lost consulting engagements because his book gave too many trade secrets away!"
2,Managing Crises: Short on Substance,"Managing Crises has helpful checklists of things to consider and the author's Rules for dealing with crises but it is short on convincing analysis. For example, one Rule is that all crises ""send out a repeated trail of early warning signals."" This is probably true in many, if not most cases, but the author fails to provide a convincing analysis that it is true for all or almost all cases. The Tylenol crisis is the books primary example, but the book fails to analyze what the early warning signals were for the Tylenol crises that the manufacturer failed to detect and act on. The book is higher on salesmanship (promoting the author's business?) than on substance."
2,Outdated,"This book is a required text for a course that I am taking at AMU. I don't know what it is about AMU, but the professors love to use outdated books. In order for a book called ""Managing Crises Before They Happen"" to be useful I would expect it to be written post 9/11, after the largest crisis the United States has experienced in the last 50 years. Unfortunately this book was written in 2000, so it was basically only relevant until 2000. It was probably a great book back then, and yes, it does have some principles that can be applied to present day, but not enough. Also, the author make vague references to events that were current at the books time of publication. For example ""crises, such as the one at Barron's Bank a few years ago"". Well now that same crisis, which is not at the forefront of everyone's mind, and occured over a decade ago, is so obscure that the reference is lost on readers. I wish the professors at AMU would update their textbook selection."
2,dangerous product,i purchased this windshield for my polaris 800 side by side and it was delivered fast and goes on easy and quick the only problem with it is it doesnt offer a very clear line of site if trail riding the windshield warps and blurs because you cant get it taunt enough if not for this i would give this product 5 stars but for serious riding this is very dangerous especially if your riding with other people.
4,Great for Price,I bought this for a Kymco 500. It is an off brand utv this windshield fit perfect. It was a gift but was told it works great
4,Love it helps to control acne,"I purchased this from my local organic store to use as a facial moisturizer and to help clear my skin tone. I have also been having a problem with adult acne and face oil since the big 40. Well to my nice surprise it has helped to control my acne. I have not had as many breakouts and it helps to speed up the healing when I do have a scar. I use it night and day. Currently using it to help a body acne scar. Great as a moisturizer and helps to control acne, score."
4,Useful!,"This is definitely the kind of game a hintbook is useful for. There are a lot of puzzles. What do I do with that Alter? How do I open that strange lock? Sometimes, you have to come back much later in the game, and sometimes you can't progress until you figure it out - being able to know if I should worry about something now or later is worth the price of the book.It also has Alchemy and Gadgetry formulas, which is nice if you don't enjoy experimenting with that sort of thing. The regular manual is exceptionally good on things like classes, skills, and spells, so those chapters don't add much.The walkthrough isn't 100% accurate in the case of what items you may get, particularly out of chests where there's some randomness, but it does seem to cover all the plot points and major points of interest.I haven't easily found any great online resources for this game, and there's definite potential to get stuck, so I'd say this book is useful."
1,Useless [book],"The writers and publishers of this guide should be ashamed. There is nothing wihin its pages that can't be found out by simply playing the game through.My primary reason for buying this guide was to find some of the things I missed before and discover new secrets. -Not only does this accursed guide NOT describe any of those things, it's actually completely in error in some of its descriptive points.The only thing this guide does do is provide you with a very basic walkthrough; which is completely useless to anyone intelligent enough to play Wizardry 8.So...I've plunked down my cash for this piece of trash, now what? -Guess it's time to go out and get myself a puppy...at least this guidebook will make a good chewtoy; it's nice and thick, chock full o' pictures with their descriptions-for some idiotic reason-placed on the previous page."
3,Good but not great,"Susan Ashton has a unique voice: you either love it, or you don't. After listening to this album several times, I must say that I don't. There's something about her voice that gets on my nerves - hard to describe - kind of a grating, almost shrill edge that limns every note. It's nice when she ventures into the richer middle and lower end of her range, but that doesn't happen often enough in these songs.Anyway, I bought this album on the strength of the reviews here, and because I liked the song ""Lonely River"", which has gotten frequent airplay on our local radio station. Besides that one, ""You Move Me"" and ""Spinning Like a Wheel"" are very good, but the rest get on my nerves - many are way too repetitive. Because of the irritating repetitiveness and her vocals, I have found I can*not* listen to this album all the way through in one sitting."
5,She is incredible. She can express a prayer so beautifully.,"Never before have I heard such a tremendous artist. It is often so hard for me to express how I feel in a beautiful way, and she does it brilliantly. She glorifies God in every word, and is extremely gifted. This CD is very encouraging. Everyone should have it."
4,One of the best Alpine mysteries,I enjoyed this mystery and have read all but one of the previous Alpine books. But I almost didn't read this one because it starts out so slowly. The books were better at 200 pages.But I do really enjoy learning more about the community. The author has created a real world in Alpine.
4,Good game,i have it on the ps2 and it is good it has the voice acting form the show and its from saiyan to cell games saga its fun to play two players two
5,X-TREME!!!,"Before I begin this review, I would like to state my opinions.1: DBZ fans only. (Otherwise this game would be very hard to understand, and some inconsiderate fools just don't understand creative genius when they see it). 2: If you think this game is too easy, than try medium, hard, or very hard. Try to unlock all characters. 3: Anyone that hates this game is a nincompoop.Play through the story, enter the tournament, and customize to make the best character ever! Guaranteed to make you laugh your head off, this is also a very funny game. (Like Hercule, what an idiot). Guess what else? Win zenie, watch movies, and beat the living daylights out of anyone who stands in your way. Could life get any better?(One more thing. You can also enter practice mode to improve your moves and try out attacks. I mean, did you see Trunks's Burning Attack? It practically destroys everything, I mean EVERYTHING!!! Cool)."
4,a complanit against another reviewer,I have only one thing to say to the reviewer who said that the american music and voices were bad. THE DBZ AMERICAN MUSIC AND VOICES WILL BE AND WILL ALWAYS BE FOR ALL ETERNITY BETTER THAN THE JAPANESE VOICES AND MUSIC! I mean Goku sounds like Master Roshi with a cold and the Japanese music belongs in a Disco. I mean it would have been cool in the 80's but the music is so weak and Goku has lost his Saya-jin character. That reviewer should shut the hell up and keep his comments to himself because the Japanese episodes are WEAK!
1,dumb game,Depressing really dragonballz budokai was a failure and disappointment on playstation 2.Friends that bought it said it had a cheesy ending.Come on budokai and ps2 were meant to be.Budokai gets 4 thumbs down.Poor dbz being presented like this.
5,Great and informative book .,Very informative and handy book . I really enjoyed going through it and it was one of the best books in homeopathy .i highly recommend it to friends and relatives to use this book .
5,Love Those African Greys,"I love the African Grey socks! Not only are they well made and durable, but it is not easy to find socks showing that particular parrot. I was thrilled to find a pair. They also slip on easily with a band that fits around a normal adult calf WITHOUT sliding down in my clogs when I walk and as a nurse, I walk alot at work."
2,"Screws are cheap, do not buy",Tried installing this door chain today and broke the heads off two of the accompanied screws using only a screwdriver. Now I have to go to the hardware store and find higher quality screws to use. Save yourself the trouble and buy a better product.
5,Citizens Band,"I Remember when this was first on Tv I was in to CB Radios I Love the Movie and Today I Still Love to watch it I Still use CB Radio and Monitor CB Channel-9 for Emergencys Iam a REACT Member and CB Radio Hear in Shelby,NC is Still Hopping I Miss the Good Old Days. REACT is Still Around and Going Good and it is 49 Years Old and All Over The Wrold We been in Shelby 16 Years. Take Care God Bless to all."
4,Good collar,"We've bought these kind of collars many times in the past, as the rolled leather collars seem to do the best in terms of being comfortable for our dogs and not causing loss of neck hair or skin irritation. The collar is a little stiff at first, but really not bad. Don't expect the red color to stay vibrant for long. They always fade out over time or the color leaches out after it gets wet a lot, but these collars hold up well for a long time. A Tagg pet tracker GPS device attaches easily to this collar, too. Would buy again."
2,Only just another anatomy text,"This book certainly does not deserve the positive comments it has, true it is a small book compared to other anatomy texts, but it also lacks alot of the important details and fine points that are regarded as been essential to a medical course in anatomy. It has terribly few diagrams and even those which are there are of little value since they're too small, and don't often enough tell you the important points. It's an OK book, just like any other text on the market with nothing special to it. And it may be suitable and highly regarded only to those studying at the institutuion the author teaches at."
4,Great movie - however this dvd is edited,"An outstanding movie. This film has always been a favorite. I was sad to see though that this DVD version has been edited. Some lines are missing here and there. If not for that, I would rate it 5 stars. I do not understand why those lines would have been taken out."
4,great little thriller beat oliver stone by a few years,"kristofferson and williams play border guards who find a jeep buried for 20 plus years with a dead man a gun and $800,000 in cash. before you can say j.f.k. these boys have bitten off more than they can chew.the thrills in this are very good and really you can spot the plot twist a mile away,but the movie is so good give it a try and i think you will like it."
5,Clark Rocks!,"Clark Bartram has always given sensible, realistic and proven advice for how to get into shape and stay that way. No pie in the sky here. Just real know-how. He's taken that same approach when it comes to the world of fitness modeling. Anyone who's worked hard to scult their body would be glad to earn a living showing it off. Clark gives you the real behind-the-scenes advise on how to make that happen. For years this guy has been on the cover of top-selling magazines like Muscle and Fitness. People in the business know him as a consumate professional. This is a quick, easy way to glean the lessons Clark has learned the hard way and to get a crack at really being a fitness model."
1,140 minutes I'll never get back,"Holy cow, where do I begin? First of all - I'm offended that someone referred to this as a ""chick flick"" because it is decidedly NOT that! It is awful!! (side note: I'm tired of people, usually men, referring to movies they don't like as ""chick flicks"".)Somehow Ray Liotta and Glenne Headly pull off these terrible roles, but the rest of the cast stinks. Period.The story is stupid and the lines fall flat. And what is with that ridiculous blue suit???? UGH save your time and money, and pass on this turkey. You'll be glad you did."
1,A Season In Hell,"Why am I the first to review this movie? The answer is obvious. This one is so bad not even a woman will admit to watching this ""Chick Flick."" I was forced to watch and I stayed with it only to get my revenge by writing this. Any man who acts like Ray does in this movie ought to be stipped of his gender. And what man would want any of the women in this film? I am not talking about looks here. All three female leads are gorgous. What I am talking about is their behavior. Clearly Ray was not that bad a guy but his wife and daughters treat him like a war criminal. Avoid at all costs unless you want to exchange your good mood for rage. PS: A great Loving Spoonful song is wasted here to boot."
4,If you liked Asimov's original Foundation series this is for you,"Ii is written very much in the Asimov style, so not jarring in the story line at all. I liked it and recommend it. Reviews said skip the first book of the 3 series followup so I started with this one (the 2nd of 3) and don't feel like I have missed anything by skipping the first new one. Can't wait to read the 3rd to finish the story line up.I did think the trilogy would take over to cover the last 500 years of the 1,000 years of rebuilding, but so far this book is 100% on the topic of the Empire at the time Hari Seldon goes on trial. Good background info though, and interesting."
3,Just okay,This is an attempt by the Killer B's to expand upon the foundation series. This book looks upon the time and circumstances of Hari Seldon and explore the events that followed to establishment of the 2 foundations more closely. This book also ties the knots of foundation with Robots and the eternals. It is a good read if you are a foundation fanatic.
2,Who needs it?,"Though this book was written much better than Foundation's Fear, I wasn't very impressed. You know how movie studios always do re-makes of old movies? Well this here is a re-write, basically of the first chapter of Asimov's classic original Foundation book. What a waste of paper. If you already read the original, then you already know what will happen at the end."
5,Asimov collections,"Amazon should combine the books of a subject together so as to make ordering easier, in the same way you have combined lists. For eg. all of Robot books of Asimov in onr orderable quantity and the foundation series in another."
4,New point of view,"Greg Bear manages to fix Gregory Benfords' horrible 'Foundation's Fear'.This is a wonderfull book and Bear, evidently, has studied his Asimov. Thank god the only mention of the sims is only to correct their existence.This book takes place during the inmediate time before the Foundation original trilogy starts. The last chapters of the book show Seldon's side of what happens to Gaal Dornick during the starting chapters of Asimov's Foundation.This book makes you want to go back and start from A1 with Asimovs' Foundation trilogy.I definitly recomend this book to any of his fans."
1,This was really bad,"I rented this game and wow it was just as bad as the others (LK's)were good. Bad camra angles, bad play through system, and what happend to all the cool stuff you got in the last games. Don't buy this one!!!"
5,Why Would Anybody Buy An iPod??,"I bought the Zen Vision M 30Gb to show videos in class where I teach. Its functionality, price and ease of use proved to me yet again how marketing overwhelms everything in contemporary America! At well under half the price for similar devices that don't do half as much or have a quarter of the memory, this device held, converted and played all types of vids via an a/v hookup to my tv at home and the projection-style media set-up at my campus. The fact that it also has an FM radio, plays music files, stores pics and other types of data, and comes with good support software makes it far superior to things like the iPod and other devices. Yet even hard-core techies at my job have never heard of it, Creative Zen or knew that many features could be had for the price I paid. Prisoners of the marketers! No matter; their ignorance and willful adaption to advertising hype helps keep great products like this a real bargin."
4,"Beats the Ipod, in my opinion","I just got the Zen Vision M 30gb for 180 bucks, and so far I am impressed with it. I think the price is great, and I also like the quality of the music and video. My only complaints are that you need to use Windows MEdia Player instead of Itunes, and that they didnt include a charger with the unit. Im still happy that I got this instead of the Ipod"
1,Amazon and Creative have greatly disappointed me,"I think it is ridiculous that Creative isn't shipping these out fast enough, but I think it's even more ridiculous that Amazon had it for sale (without the out of stock warning) and they get to change the shipping date."
2,"Hate to say it,But shoulda bought an IPOD","Well when the Device worked it was great hence the 2 stars.But 2wks after buying this thing it dumped its firmware outta the blue.Not too much of a problem just had to reload it.Than it started coming down with ""hiccups""(freezing and had to be reset about a dozen times.Finally it refused to boot up and says Harddisk problem.No fix I could find online and being in Iraq I'm now stuck with this 250$ paperweight."
5,stands out from the crowd,"just purchased the Vision M, and I am loving it!! I had issues at first with it not charging, but a firmware upgrade from creative's website took care of that. I love the feel of it, sure its a little heavier than an ipod, but at least it doesn't feel like it may break in half if dropped. i also love the touchpad, a little tricky to get used to to, but after turning down it sensitivity a notch i found it much easier to maneuver than the click wheel of an ipod. Sound and visual quality are excellent, easy to load files and supports so many more extentions than the ipod or zune. well worth the money! staples.com does an excellent comparision of the vision:m, ipod and zune, so if you are debating on which one to buy you can see them side by side, very helpful. loving the vision m!!"
3,A great entry level mp3 player with a lot of space.,"This product doesn't stand up to an iPod Touch but it is a great player for the mp3 space. The navigation is something to get used to but it is okay as well.The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester."
1,I thought it was amazing until...,"So i've had it for about 2 years, it WAS amazing to me, my first mp3. About 1,000 songs, videos, recording from the radio etc. Then without being dropped, without anything odd, it decided to delete absolutely every video, photo, and song file that I had. Of course beforehand it had the common freezes, I had to restart it every once in a while. But now I have to get a complete new one. It's ridiculous. In long term this isn't the player for you, but if you want to spend that much money for 2 years go ahead. I think i'm going to try a Zune."
4,Creative Zen Review,This mp3 player is very nice and suits my needs well. The interface took a day to get used to though and it sometimes freezes. Otherwise it plays music well.
3,wall charger?,"I just received my Zen Vision M today and from my my brief experience it appears to be a very nice unit. It is way too early to give an accurate review, but I want to know what is the deal with all the reviewers saying that one of the benefits of the Vision:M over Ipod is that it comes with its own wall charger? Well, I can tell you that it doesn't! This disappointment is why I am giving it a 3-star rating. I e-mailed Amazon.com and they responded by saying ""we are sorry you were misled.....blah, blah, blah"". I called Creative Labs and the woman on the phone told me that the Vision:M has never included a wall charger! What gives??? What am I missing here? Can anyone let me know?"
5,Beats the 5th gen ipod and Zune by a mile.,"The absolute best mp3 player I have ever purchased. Best picture clarity over 200k colors, best sound 192 kbps and beyond, microphone picks up my professors lectures easily and clearly, coverflow before ipod 6, 10 megapixel pics look like 10 megapixel pics on the zen, and finally battery life is awesome 20 hours audio 5 video. It's a little old now, but nothing new has been made that completely out shines it, if you can find this cheap don't double guess because its a little dated, buy it."
4,What a steal!!!!!,"After putting up with my old Dell Pocket DJ for years, the Zen is like a breath of fresh air. I still can't believe I was able to purchase it for only $125.00. Apparently, it was a closeout because one week later there were none left. The sound quality and ease of operation is outstanding and the volume balancing between songs actually works!The only criticism I have is that the software that comes loaded is quite prone to lockups, especially when dealing with large volumes of music. Once I downloaded the latest software form their web site, the Zen has not locked up once. I have a large collection of MP3 and WMA files and they work like a charm. Once I realized what an excellent player this was, I went back to Yahoo to purchase another but they were gone. If you can still find one, buy it!"
5,Great MP3 Player - Well worth it,"I spent a long time researching mp3 players, trying to decide which one I wanted. I knew I didn't want an iPod, and I knew the basics that I wanted. At first I didn't want one like the Vision:M - I just wanted your basic player that didn't have Videos or whatever added. The more I looked around, the more I kept coming back to this mp3 though - and now that I've bought it I'm very happy I did. The sound quality (granted I'm using different headphones than came with it) is wonderful, the screen is beautiful, and the interface is not only easy to use and easy to learn, but simple and quite easily done with one hand while doing other things that keep you from actually looking at it. Sure, it's a little bulky, but it still fits just fine in a jeans pocket, or purse. It's also very light. All in all, it's a great product, and well worth the money spent on it."
5,Great Scores Everywhere!,"This thing has been getting awesome reviews, and was apparently no.9 in some magazine for Coolest products of 2006 (A list of ALL things cool, not just daps). I recieved mine not to long ago and I love it. Video quality is amazing and so is the sound quality. The custimization is unbeliable and NOONE thinks I have an iPod when my screen is a bright pink.Only probem I've had so far is scratching. I recommend getting some plastic face covers."
4,Pretty good,"Well to start, I really enjoy owning this player. It beats any Ipod I've used. I especially like the video capabilities and the design. Originally I purchased the 30g version. It was dropped about 4 feet onto a hardwood floor and that ruined the hard-drive. The person who dropped it generously replaced it with the 60g version. That one was working fine for a couple weeks until I got it out one day and, low and behold, the screen had cracked. I still have no idea what prompted this. (I do not recommend doing this) Since I still had the old one I took both apart and switched the screens and to this day I have not had any more problems. I use Sennheiser HD 280 headphones with this player (sure its a little bulky but I don't mind) and the sound quality is superb. Overall these should be 5 stars but the durability factor takes them down to a 4."
1,"It's unfair of Amazon to have the front page reviews say product includes an adapter, when it doesn't ship that way anymore","This is a deceptive sales practice, and Amazon should be ashamed."
4,Sturdy and easy to use player.,"This is one of the best MP3 players on the market. I've had mine for about 2 years now and would never use another player. The battery life is long and the software easy to use. The player itself is also pretty sturdy. I've dropped mine a few times, and other than the occasional scratch, it is in fine working order. If you want an easy to use MP3 player with a lot od storage space and a great battery life this one is for you."
4,My Daughter loves it...,"She received it as a birthday gift and has been very pleased despite her original request for the leading i-product. I was concerned once when she made a lengthy vocal recording and it stalled, but once reset it has been fine. Does everything she wanted and more - syncs with Windows Media, wherein she can make all her playlists."
2,A gift and a curse,"This was my dream come true, better features than video ipod, easy management,but then the worst happened. After a week the player got overheated and the battery blew out, I'm now trying to exchange this for a video ipod. Creative made a terrible product."
3,"Zen works, then it doesnt....",It seems there are still some compatibility issues with Vista and syncing the device. all in all its a pretty good player. just wish there was better support when it stops working.
1,Cool Toy--if it worked!,"I wouldn't buy it again, that's for sure.The Zen is a fairly charming alternative to the ipod. It's sleek enough, the display is pretty, and the sound quality is impressive. But I got TWO of these things in a row and each worked for about a month before they stopped ""docking"" altogether. I tried different machines, I tried different cords, I even tried different sync adapters, and one after the other (my original purchase, then the player Amazon sent me as a replacement) became totally useless.Amazon, the wonderful, gave me a refund, but it's still a bummer. Save yourself the money and heartache and buy something with a track record."
2,Stopped working after about a year and a half,"I've noticed most reviews are written shortly after buying a product - I thought I would give a caution to any buyers who are curious about the durability of this mp3 player. This thing worked great for about a year and a half. Then it abruptly stopped working for no reason. I had dropped it once or twice, but not for a long while before when it quit working.It's the second mp3 player I've bought from Creative, and the other one lasted about the same time and then broke, same as this.If you don't mind your mp3 player breaking down after a year and a half or so, then this one would be great. Otherwise, stay away."
1,Creative: horrible customer service,"i just bought mp3 player today, and couldn't fire it up. tried to find their customer service number online with no luck. finally found one toll free number, but only available during weekdays.in today's world we expect better than this in terms of customer service"
5,Excellent MP3 Player,"Easy to use, compatible with Windows XP, Great Sound Quality. Tough! so far it is still working I dropped in couple times on concrete floor."
1,"great, until the usb connection stops, NO customer service","loved the product, until the USB connection stopped working. The web directions instruct you to ""first back up your device"". Duh - the connection does not work, how are you supposed to back it up ? I contacted customer service, and they will not talk to you after the 1 year period. From searching the web, it looks like this is a known defect. For the price this costs, they owe an answer to their customers. Unless you want an expensive disposable MP3, stay away"
2,Maybe An Isolated Issue,I've had this item for two weeks now and I still cannot resolve the issue of it not recognized by both my desktop and laptop. Technical support through e-mail is frustrating because it takes forever. I guess my unit is just a lemon since all the reviews here are all positive and in the up and up.
5,What an awesome CD!,"This has to be one of my favorite CDs of all time. I first heard it in my boyfriend's car; when we broke up, I ordered my own! It has a permanent place in my car CD collection. I get something different out of it every time I listen to it. The songs are so catchy, there isn't a single one I skip over. I would reccommend this CD to any of my friends, and it's actually gotten a couple interested in Christian music!"
2,Bad experience,I can not recommend this watch.The band plastic or rubber/plastic black material was broken 11 months after the purchase. The suggested solution from Suiss Army: to buy a new band.Swiss Army must not sell watches with this kind of band material
4,a marriage on the rocks,"A Test of Time, is the follow-up novel, to Chery Faye's winner, A Time For Us. I highly suggest that you read, A Time For Us, first. You will be able to understand herione, Nicole Peterson's insecurities. Mark Peterson is a successful, attractive man who loves his wife. Due to a series of misunderstandings, this beautiful, ambitious couple fight, seperate and eventually reconcile their differences. At times, the reader becomes dismayed and impatient with Mark and Nicole, however Faye keeps you abreast of their thoughts and feelings toward each other throughout the novel. This is a must-read, because the author tackles the reality of a marriage that could be headed for divorce."
4,revisited old memories,"I wanted to read this book because I was in college with a guy who was friends with Don back in the day.He used to tell me all these larger than life stories of Don Bragg so I wanted to hear from the man himself and maybe see if he mentioned my old friend in his book.The book was just like hearing my friend talking back in 72 of all these wild and zany actions that took place back in his home in the Jersey area. I thought some of the stories my friend told were stretched a bit but having read the book I see he was telling the truth. It was good to hear things spoken in Mr Braggs own words and bitter sweet to have him mention my friend Dougs name in the book as he was killed in a car wreck in the eighties.I had always thought that we would meet up again but you start families and time slips by and, well you know. Don Bragg living life every day to the fullest is what I took away from my friend in 72 and now again by reading his book. Thanks Don for sharing."
4,Fantastic bonus track,the bonus track 'crash and burn' is fantastic. I can't understand why It wasn't used on her album.crash and burn is the bonus audio track that appears on the 'live at wembly' DVD.It is deffinatly worth the money.A must for any P!nk fan.Pink - Live from Wembley Arena
5,A breakthrough in PS2 gaming technology!,This is a most excellent PS/2 gaming accessory. The 12 games that are included with the Eye Toy are quite fun. When played in multi-player mode it is really exciting. Just be sure to take it easy for the first couple of days -- your arms will get sore from waving them around in front of the camera. :)
4,Good for children of all ages!,"My daughter and I both love playing with the Eye Toy. She is almost 4 years old, but picked up on how to play everything very quickly. I find it as much fun as she does! This is a GREAT game for parents to enjoy with their children. I give it very high marks for creativity as well as enjoyment."
2,eye toy gets boring,the only reason I go on this is for excercise but just like it gets boring the more you play on it the less tired you get so you won't be breathing hard like you do when jogging for a long time. The beat freak game is my favourite because it does not get boring...the 2 best songs are sing it back and boogie night(I don't listen to this kind of music but it goes great with this mini game).
4,Camera/Games,The camera on the Eyetoy does not produce very clear images but on the box the image appears alot clearier then it really is. Also the games gey pretty repetive after not very long. Overall the games are fun to play especialy the kung fu and and boxing game. I would like to see this game playable online though.
4,just as good then as now,"I remember going to see Steven Curtis Chapman at small concerts back when he first started. Back then I was impressed with his dedication to ministry and his sincerity. Today when I hear him in interviews or listen to new lyrics, I am still impressed with those same qualities. His songs have improved, as one would hope, but every lyric he writes has God's fingerprint on it."
3,To be called a Grip it just didn't fit like one.,"It wasn't the fit I was hoping for , being as loose as it was my 8 year old is a bit rough and quickly damaged it when trying to change games he ripped a corner of the skin now he doesn't want to use it."
2,Okay for the Money,"This product was okay considering it was so cheap. However, the sleeves that hold the cd's/dvd's fall out when you try to flip the pages."
3,"Great product, if your satellite dish fits!","This is a great product that allows a clean installation on a shingle roof without running cables on the side. The installation is simple for a DIY and there are videos online so that you can see how easy it is.The only problem? My Winegard DS-2076 mount does not fit the holes on the mount. The Winegard comes with a universal mount, so it should be compatible, but it isn't. Before buying this, be sure your dish will fit!!"
4,Best Christmas CD I have heard!!!!,"This CD will get you into the real spirit of Christmas. A chance to hear timeless classics with the new voice of our generation. Point of Grace's ""Hark the Hearald Angels Sing"" will get you praising Him and lift your own spirit. A must have for any Christmas collection."
2,Rather Uninspired,"This album was a collection of mediocre and rather uninspired songs from Christian artists. The only real highlights were Sandi Patty's ""O Holy Night"" and Twila Paris's rendition of ""Have Yourself..."" Where's Amy Grant? Point of Grace's ""Hark the Herald"" is dull as well - not up to par with their fabulous Christmas CD."
4,At least thier original.,"Look thses guys might not be the best, but at least Donnie Van Zant didnt go snatch his older brothers band after he was klled in an airplane accident. .38 Special has thier own style, they didnt just copy Skynyrd or the Allman Brothers like many other southern rock bands did. So maybe you should buy this album if you want something more original."
5,"38 SPECIAL ""The Very Best of the A & M Years"" CD","THIS IS GREAT ""JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA"" ""SOUTHERN ROCK""!!! THIS IS 38 SPECIAL, WITH 18 OF THEIR GREAT SOUTHERN ROCK CLASSICS!!! ONE OF RONNIE VAN ZANT'S YOUNGER BROTHERS, DONNIE IS ONE OF THE LEAD SINGERS AND A GUITAR PLAYER IN THE BAND. THE OTHER LEAD SINGER AND GUITAR PLAYER IS DON BARNES. THE BAND CONSISTS OF 6 MEMBERS. THIS BAND AND THIS CD ROCKS!!!SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE: ""ROCKIN' INTO THE NIGHT"", ""HOLD ON LOOSLY"", ""WILD-EYED SOUTHERN BOYS"", ""FANTASY GIRL"", ""CAUGHT UP IN YOU"", ""CHAIN LIGHTIN'"", ""YOU KEEP RUNNIN' AWAY"", ""TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX"", ""BACK WHERE WE BELONG"", ""TEACHER TEACHER"", ""SOMEBODY LIKE YOU"", AND ""TAKE ME BACK"".THIS CD IS PROBABLY THE BEST CD TO HAVE OF 38 SPECIAL, BECAUSE YOU GET ALL THEIR CLASSICS ON ONE CD!!! THIS IS SOUTHERN ROCK AT ITS BEST!!! I RECOMMEND THIS ONE AND THEIR DVD THAT WAS FILMED AT THE STURGIS MOTORCYCLE FESTIVAL (SEE MY REVIEW OF THE DVD 38 SPECIAL LIVE)!!!!"
1,Too complicated,"I ordered this book over the holidays for a friend with three little ones thinking it would be a fun activity for them. When I received it I looked through it and thought my goodness how can anyone figure out how these are suppose to sound. I found it would take a few hours to figure it out and so knowing my friend is a busy Mom as it is would not appreciate receiving something of this nature. The print is very small and I think it would be better in a spiral binding, larger print and a CD along with it to give an example of how the clap is suppose to sound. I have a masters in music and if I found this confusing, good luck for everyone else."
2,not so good,"i bought this for my daughter for chrismtas, and she still hasn't used it - she's tried looking through it several times, but it's hard to follow and the rhymes aren't that fun (kind of strange, actually.)"
2,What's with the Coding?,"If you don't own a DVD player that can play discs from all regions, don't waste your money here. The coding for this dvd won't work with most American machines."
5,The Pool!,Hot guys but that is not the only reason to watch this film. It has a different feel to it. You have to overlook somethings but if you can tune in to the scenery and what the director is trying to bring across I think you will be surprised. If you expect to see action all the time then it's not your movie.
3,Small and Good,"Though this camera is good for beginners, it does not suit for some one wanting to take quality pictures.The photos does not come good in evening lighting.The quality of photos is not as good as those sample photographs."
4,great product for great price,i bought this for a family member as their 1st camera.A great camera for the price and easy to understand
3,Average digital camera,"I'm not sure why I bought this product, but it has served me well enough. I prefer my digital Canon though. Firstly, the lack of manual configuration annoys me, as well as the painfully slow review speed, especially at high resolutions. Seems cheaply build and assembled. Actual pictures are clear enough, but once again my Canon takes clearer photos faster and clearer at the same resolution.For the price it wasn't a bad investment, but be smart and purchase a quality Canon instead."
2,Not Meant for Beginners,"I really wanted for my 4-year-old son to be able to play his favorite CDs on his own. He easily loads and empties our DVD and VCR players, as well as his video games, so this didn't seem like a stretch to me. This front-loading player, however, just has no stamina for basic opening and closing, whether it's a preschooler performing the task or not. If you really think *your child* will be able to use this player, think again---*you* will need to play the discs for him. This player didn't last us a week and it wasn't because of misuse---it's just not up to anything more than kid gloves and a delicate touch."
5,GREAT!,bought these for my Meguiars DA polisher. they work like they should. i get a great reflection on my cardinal red truck after using all the pads offered.cant go wrong with meguiars!
1,Velcro Backing Fell off on First Use,The pad worked great at first. I used the pad with the Meguiar's DA and Meguiar's Ultimate Synthetic Wax. This is on a 2011 truck so the paint was not in bad shape. I used this to apply wax after polishin. The velcro backing came off the pad and was rendered useless.
3,not as good as I expected,"The Meguiar's buffer system takes a lot of getting used to because these pads are hook and loop attachment. The hook and loop (Velcro) is not very strong, and it is glued to the foam. This means 2 things... the pads will fly off and have to be constantly re-centered and reattached while you're working.. and once they get hot the glue lets go and then you need a new pad. This is very poor design for a buffer system that costs $150 for the tool and $0 per pad. If you can get past those limitations, you will get a well buffed car."
3,Ashley's Review,"I liked this book because it is by Lurlene McDaniel and she is my favorite author. Her books are either about cancer survivors or people with diseases. I have read most of her books and this one wasn't my favorite because it didn't give me the feeling I usually get when I read her books.It is about a sixteen year old girl named Dawn and she is finding out that she is cured from leukemia! She finds out that they are building a new wing at the hospital for cancer survivors. She is the first one mentioned. They are also burying a time capsule for people to open in one hundred years! Dawn gets to make a speech and pick the things to go into the box.I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn about cancer, or what life is like having cancer."
1,SO PREDICTABLE,"I read this book because I had thought that it would be good, but instead it turned out that after about 2 chapters I knew exactly what was going to happen and my prediction was true. I would never recommened this book to anyone because it was one of the worst books I've ever read!!!"
5,video game,"I don't want to rate this game because it was never released but I have to give it a rating. The review before me said this was a very bad game. Well, how can you say that since this game was never released. The Gameboy Advance He man game did suck but this neither sucks or is good. I am very that this game isn't going to be released. I was looking forward to playing this."
5,Awesome Game,"This is a game that I have been trying to find for almost 5 years. This is a great party game, it not too long, easy to play and very exciting. The game came supper fast and it plays great. I will purchase from this seller again."
4,Perfect Fit with some modification,"Item arrived quickly and fit perfectly on my '84 Dodge P/U frame rails, but would not allow the simultaneous installation of the spare tire support bracket without some modification. Still working on that."
5,Great Collections video,I think this video captures most of the Historic Inauguration Day of President Obama. (2009) I will keep it as I would a great book.
1,Does not work!,I thought a universal walker would fit and it does not work. Good idea but bad design and not universal. Too expensive to return so save your money and don't buy this item.
3,"It's not ""universal!""","It doesn't fit my walker that well (I have an Invacare) but fits well enough so that I can use it occasionally for church pot-lucks, buffets, etc. I just have to be careful to keep it level or it will tip to the side."
5,Perfect tray for walkers!,This walker tray was exactly what Mom needed! Light and easy for her to put on and take off. She uses it to carry her laundry basket too!
1,Universal Walker Tray Doesn't Fit,I purchased the tray for my mother's walker and it doesn't fit at all. I had to attach it with clamps in order for her to use it. It really doesn't leave enough room for her hands on the walker. I would have sent it back but managed to make it work.
3,Gently rockin,"3 1/2Earnest debut of alt-pop-twang can crib too much from MMJ's earlier sound, but in almost all simplistic songwriting still retains a doe-eyed soul. Hear it for the lush acoustic closer alone."
1,Yawn,"This is boring faceless alt country indie rock. These guys have less outlaw cred than John Kerry at a 1000 dollar a plate dinner. Normally I don't knock bands for doing their own thing, but here the affectation is too much.""when we leave this place and drive back to carolinaand down to savannah andstay.."" yeah right. Friggin Seattlites. Maybe drive down to Olympia to get some chai tea. It strikes me how if any band musters up a few country chords, and wear trucker hats they will get a decent review on pitchfork.Rant over."
4,Good Work / Strange Bedfellows,"Watters Brothers are on the right track. They do, however, make a strange musical pair, especially in that they are brothers.Harry (trombonist) is a more accomplished, astonishing, technician. Ken has a more unique sound, both in playing & composing.The siblings seem effectively compliment each other's strengths & weaknesses & have seemingly ""agreed to disagree"" on style. It works. For me, anyway. Believe it or not, these are all three surprisingly cohesive tune collections.""Our Eyes are Watching,"" a Harry Watters song, seems based on a Haitian / African Bembe' feel song & brings to mind a Haitian folklore ballad called ""N'ap Toujou We Sa"" (""we will always see"")... Perhaps this song was a Watters Brothers collaboration? I mention this because trumpeter Ken is a long-time member of a very famous Haitian band (Tabou Combo) & it would make more sense if he were at least a co-writer on this track. Curious."
4,Talented musicians + clever lyrics = $ well spent,"A rock band with an agenda other than annoying parents. This band is suprisingly good at what they do, creating enjoyable not-so-heavy rock for teens while demonstrating creative musical talent. The lyrics are thoughtful and clearly delivered, and theres a real element of fun to the whole cd. The tunes are catchy and clever and the price is good. What are you waiting for?"
4,A useful book,The book is excellent to improve your knowledge in Risk Management area and useful to understand some tools available to management project risk.
3,Gay Apartment 3-G,"A compilation of the ""Chelsea Boys"" comic strip series that appears in many gay papers and online. The boys are familiar characters in gay comics, and in fact, the same trio, dumpy everyman, buffed innocent, and sassy snap-queen previously appeared in Jerry Mills' ""Poppers."" But Hanson and Neuwirth move beyond the gag-a-month format to add a complexity to the characters, giving them back stories and crises, making them fragile, multidimensional, and likeable.Overall, this is a pleasant diversion, deserving a place on the shelf next to Allison Bechtel's ""Dykes to Watch Out For"" and the opus of Howard Cruise."
2,Not opaque,"The HUE tights I previewed in the department stores are all heavy, opaque tights. This product was not. The product is like black footless panty hose."
4,Good fit and Color,Don't run easily and nice and dark. Good control top. Just wish they were a bit less expensive!
3,Still holding up,"This volume contains stories which were a bit removed from the previous ones and characters like Metamorpho (who refused to join) and the Spectre found themselves involved within the adventures of the JLA. One could see the ""camp"" flavor was here upon us, just months before the 1966 Batman TV series premiered."
1,horrible,"The flag looks like it has a spider or onion in the middle of it. The flag stands for oppression, radical islam and terrorism. I dont understand why any one would buy such a thing. Who could be proud of this flag? Were any german proud of the Nazi's flag? I doubt it. This flag is the symbol of oppression and terrorism. Don't buy it!"
1,"terrible quality, good coverage thou","mine broke within one hour of putting it on, the little holder that holds one of the squares went flying all over as it shattered. i now use the protecter to just lay on top and i put a rubber band over it to keep it safe in my pocketit looks nice, but it is terrible quality"
4,Excellent!,One of the best cd's I own! I listen to it all the time. Her sound is sooooo different and unique. She is still a Spice Girl yet doing her own thing! It is great! The songs are wonderful! Buy this cd!
5,Great cd for her solo debut,"I've loved Melanie's voice from the moment I heard her and she has always been my favorite Spice Girl.I was hoping her cd would be as great as I knew her talent was and I wasn't disappointed.I have to admit that the ""Goin' Down"" track is a bit harsh and the distortion to her voice was not needed. Her voice holds it's own and doesn't need any kind of enhancement.Great job Melanie and I hope to own another solo cd from you soon."
3,overflow,"We bought theCuisinart ICE-30BC Pure Indulgence 2-Quart Automatic Frozen Yogurt, Sorbet, and Ice Cream Makerlast summer. While pretty happy with it, have noticed that it overflows with full 2-quart recipes. So, we add only slightly more than 1 quart of liquid per batch. We love having ice milk (simple mix of pasteurized milk, sugar and vanilla . . . easy on the sugar) for those hot, humid days of summer. As noted by others, the machine is noisy; so we put it outside on the porch and add the ingredients there. That's a small inconvenience, but preserves sanity inside the house."
4,So worth the money to have your own ice cream machine,"I LOVE this machine. I love frozen yogurt/ice cream/that kind of stuff. It comes with a small booklet of recipes that you can try or you can make your own mixes! I've made ice creams that are far better than the ones in stores that have been frozen and thawed for who knows how long. Fresh is the way to go!! Making fresh strawberry ice cream or frozen yogurt is my favorite.The only reason why it gets 4 stars is because it sounds, like others have said, like a small jet engine when it is churning. But it's only for 25 mins and is so worth it!!"
1,Inconistent Results Very Wasteful,"I have had this Ice Cream Maker for over a year and about once for every 3 times I use it the ice cream doesn't freeze. It doesn't seem to have any relationship to ingredients or recipe although the first time it happened I was using a new recipe with eggs so I blamed that. It worked fine for the next few times using my old stand by no cook, no egg recipe and then inexplicably wouldn't freeze. I am tired of wasting expensive ingredients so at this point, I am looking for a replacement. I have a Cuisinart coffee maker that has the same random malfunctions....about every 4 months or so it leaks coffee all over the counter and then next day, it i fine."
5,Great for more than Ice Cream,"I bought my first Cuisinart product 25 years ago and it still works perfectly!, so I was excited to know that I could purchase aCuisinart ICE-30BC Pure Indulgence 2-Quart Automatic Frozen Yogurt, Sorbet, and Ice Cream Maker, I wasn't sure what size to get, as there are just 2 of us, but I am glad I bought the 2-quart. The freezer canister doesn't take up very much room in the freezer. We got this to make sorbets and frozen drinks, and it does this perfectly- You can put a quart of non-fat flavored yogurt in it and in 20 minutes have fantastic frozen yogurt for less than it cost to purchase a pint of frozen yogurt. Pour your favorite fruit juice in and have a wonderful slushy in minutes- We love it. It's a fantastic way to make frozen desserts with out added sugar or fat."
5,Better than expected,"This machine was great...it makes wonderful soft-serve icecream pretty quickly. If you like your ice cream harder you can just pop it in the freezer; I myself actually prefer soft serve so I loved this machine. It was better than I had expected, and it has great recipes. As a side note, the Ben and Jerry's ice cream book also has wonderful recipes."
1,Very Misleading,"This is advertised as ""fully automatic."" Actually, the device itself only turns slowly around. Electricity is not used in the freezing process at all. In fact, you have to freeze the bucked for at least a day (directions say 6-22 hours, but 22 hours is optimistic), and the bucket takes up a third of my freezer. I thought ""fully automatic"" means everything happens in the device itself and doesn't require the work of my freezer. Additionally, this process doesn't really get the ice cream cold enough either. So the directions recommend making an ice bath for the mixture before placing it in the device. I wanted a device whereby I pour the mixture into the device, turn it on, and some time thereafter ice cream is produced - that's fully automatic. That is NOT this device."
5,Awesome and Very Easy!,"My Husband got this for a gift!I've made 3 of the recipes from the recipe booklet that came with the Cuisinart ice creammaker,It is so easy to use and fast 20 to 25 min. and you have ice cream, Everyone that has tried it (family and friends) just lovethe taste.if you like ice cream you have to try the Cuisinart ICE-30BC Pure Indulgence 2-Quart Automatic Frozen Yogurt, Sorbet, and Ice Cream Maker!its great!!!!"
5,"Cuisinart Yogurt, Sorbet and Ice Cream Maker",What a nice addition to have that makes ice cream while you are eating your meal and not having to stand over it to add salt and ice. It makes enough for all of us and is a real pleasure to have.Thanks again Cuisinart.
3,Just OK,"Purchased this for my wife for Christmas. Have been following the recipes provided and constatntly produce a very soupy ice cream. Not exactly sure if this is correct or not but need to take the semi-finished product and put it in the freezer for a few hours. I'll try a few diferent recipes and see if that changes anything but for now, I'm viewing this as a middle of the road purchase. Expectations were a little higher."
5,fast and fun,i have owned the device for approximately 6 mounths.....i have made 12-15 batches of ice cream.....never a failure..the results are always superior to purchased ice cream...for the most part i have used recipes from the book that camewith the machine.....clean up is simple...great product
5,"Yum, yum, yum","The Cuisinart Ice Cream maker makes wonderful gelato!!! It is a breeze to use. In less than an hour from start to finish you can have ice cream, frozen yogurt, sorbet and my favorite gelato. Simple ingredients and easy preparation combined with the Pure Indulgence make this a wonderful addition to your kitchen. I've found that you can take a simple on-line recipe and make what ever modifications that you want and still get wonderful results . . . go ahead and get creative. You will love the results."
3,"Same old, same old","I thought this machine might be an improvement on the old Cuisinart I had discarded, but it really is the same, only jazzed up a bit in a metal container. The ice cream mixture seems to freeze on the inside surface of the container and needs scraping off to prevent build-up. Eventually I did get a lovely product."
3,i can't use it,"I couldn't make any ice cream because my freezer does not freeze the bowl, and the weather is getting colder and then we in the house, prefer now to bake some bread, cakes or cookies. Maybe next summer."
2,It's just not what I expected,"I confess my review is predicated mostly on expectations. Here's what I thought this device did: I take my ice cream ingredients, drop it into the ice-cream-o-matic and turn it on and out pops ice cream. I thought this device would stir the ingredients (it doesn't, you need a blender or hand-mixer to blend the ingredients). I thought it took the ingredients from room temperature to frosty cold ice cream (it doesn't, you have to make the freezer bowl cold first by putting it in your freezer for 6 to 22 hours first -- so much for trying it out of the box.) Unfortunately what this toy is, is a glorified ice cream mixer. Much of my expectations were based on the fact that the appliance is called a ""maker"". Live and learn I guess."
5,Love it!!!,"The Cuisinart ICE-30BC is one of our favorite purchases. It is easy and good looking!! The icecream is like soft serve but, will harden when left in the freezer a little longer. Now we have our own Cold Stone at home.Henderson NV"
5,Better than expected! Makes delicious ice cream fast and easy!,"I bought this for my ice cream-loving husband for Christmas. He was excited about being able to experiment with different flavors, I was excited about making our own ice cream with organic ingredients. We are both in love with this machine! It's SO easy and SO fast...which is awesome. But the flavor is what surprised me the most. My mom used to make ice cream sometimes when I was a kid and the taste wasn't anything worth getting excited about. I thought that is what this would taste like too....but I was willing to sacrifice for organic ice cream. I was WRONG! The ice cream tastes AMAZING! Especially vanilla made with real vanilla beans...mmmm. This machine was definitely worth the money! I bought an extra bowl as well. Most of the time, it isn't necessary, but if you wanted to either make a lot of ice cream, or make more than one flavor, it is nice to have since the bowl needs to freeze for so long in between batches..."
4,good machine,we like this. i should not eat dairy so i picked up a vegan ice cream recipe book and this machine. It works well. my husband insisted on using it the day we got it so the bowl was just frozen a bit and the ice cream was a little soupy. but since then we keep the bowl in the freeer and it's worked very well- we can eat it right out of the machine. It is pretty loud but we move it to the back of our little house for the 20-30 minutes it runs so we don't have to listen to it. Ice cream is hard to get here and expensive but this works great as we can use shelf stable items and frozen items that we have access to to make non dairy ice cream. we like it.
5,victory for ice cream lovers!,"What can I say to do justice to this ice cream maker that makes delicious ice cream in 25min. and hey, it's even better that Ben and Jerry's ( to my grandaughter)!!! ( we used the recipe in the Ben and Jerry's recipe book)"
4,"A little noisy, but very easy and LOTS of fun","I'd never used an ice cream maker before buying this machine, so I don't have anything with which to compare it... However, I can tell you that this maker is extremely easy to use and clean, and we've made really tasty ice cream with it. It comes with a handy, little recipe book, and it really does produce ice cream in 20-25 minutes.Our only complaint is that it's pretty loud; we live in a small apartment, and so we can't really escape the a-little-too-high-pitched ""whirring"" noise that it makes. Since it's only for 20 minutes, though, it's not a big deal; we can go for a walk and come back to a tasty bowl of ice cream or sorbet!We've really had a lot of fun, already, with this machine. Every batch still seems a little like magic. :)"
1,Didn't Work At All,"I purchased this based on the reviews already posted. We did everything according to the instructions for the first try, freezing the bowl for 24 hours beforehand, using a recipe we have made successfully many times over the years. It didn't freeze at all. We even let it run for an hour. When we phoned Cuisinart, we were told to try one of their recipes, as they are proven to work in the machine. So went through the process again of freezing the bowl for 24 hours. We mixed up one of their recipes and attempted to freeze it according to the instructions. It didn't thicken one little bit, even waiting beyond the suggested time. We were very disappointed and, after spending a lot of money on ingredients, weren't willing to try another machine. My bet is none of them work very well, given what we experienced."
3,Lack of funtionality,"it is better to buy an ice cream already made, to it's work you should know exactly about how to use ingredients. any mistakes could affect the wished result. too expensive"
4,Bought elsewhere,"The machine is great but when we tried to order it at the $67.99 price from Amazon, the earliest shipping date was Oct.! A quick check at the local Bed, Bath and Beyond produced the machine in stock and by using one of the many 20% off coupons that we get in the mail, the price ended up within a dollar of the free shipping Amazon price. Shop around buyers!"
5,great item,This ice cream maker is a great item. It helps me make ice cream low in calorie. Just what I need.
3,Requires PreFrozen Bowl,"This unit requires that your refrigerator prefreezes the bowl. With that in mind, the unit only mixes the ingredients as heat is transferred from your ice cream/sorbet mixture to the bowl which you just took out of the refrigerator. Moreover, most of the recipes in the book require lots of sugar. For instance to make a lemon sorbet, you need to dissolve 3 cups of sugar to 3 cups of water before adding the lemon juice and lemon/lime zest. So I think that unless you are young enough to not need to worry about dieting and getting fat, you will have to modify the recipes. In sum, I think it is better to get the 50BC cuisinart with the compressor so that you don't need to use your refrigerator to freeze the bowl, which is what I intend to do when I can afford it. I also intend to modify the recipes to reduce the caloric intake of whatever I am making."
5,Cuisenart Ice cream maker,"This ice cream maker is by far the best we've ever had, and we've had many. It makes REAL ice cream, real fast & real easy. We love it so much we've purchased 3 for friends and family and it's everybody's next birthday gift."
4,Cuisinart ICE-30BC ice cream maker,"After doing a bit of research, we bought this model to replace an ancient Salton machine. It arrived promptly and in good condition--well packed in a sturdy box. I read the instructions and promptly put the tub in a freezer. The first batch didn't work out as described, my wife had tried to concoct a low fat mixture, so it was more a problem of the recipe than the performance of the machine. Our second attempt was pistachio ice cream (from the included recipe book)--WOW!! It was absolutely the best!! It was very creamy and flavorful. After this we did a batch of strawberry and it was equally delicious. This is a quality machine that lives up to its claims. The recipe book--at least what we've sampled so far--is a winner. I'd buy another."
1,lame writing,The stories were a lot alike and not well developed in my opinion. The writing was borderline and generally found them dull.
1,DEAD!,"This is a great looking TV physically, picture is fair to poor. I purchased this directly from Philips outlet with a 90 day warranty on 3/25/07 and it is completely dead on 12/20/07, even if I doubled the warranty with AMEX it still surpasses the end date.Won't buy another Philips/Magnavox product again."
3,Product Looks Different than Picture,"The packaging was sealed in plastic and nice, but the bottle itself has a totally different logo with a big ""P R"" on it. Not sure if the style has changed or it's a knock off from China. Haven't researched it with Paco Rabanne yet. Otherwise, everything looks ok. The smell doesn't seem to last as long as my 8 year old bottle of Paco Rabanne."
3,It's OK,"I ordered this perfume for a friend that ask me fot it, he likes it, for me is too strong, but he likes it."
2,BIG disappointment,"I've owned this printer for about eight years and bought it because I had owned an Epson LQ series printer that was a trouble free workhorse. Wow, what a difference...1. The paper pickup never worked reliably from day one and ultimately stopped working altogether. Fortunately, the manual feed slot still works.2. Epson's quick drying inks are apparently VERY quick drying as you cannot let this printer sit idle for very long or else the heads clog. Head clogging has been a constant battle. The inks are also expensive.3. The paper trays are very flimsy and fragile.4. Epson designers figure that people buying large format printers do not want to print on 2+ inches on one side of the paper !!!???5. The printer is noisy in a very annoying but not extremely loud sort of way.6. Head cleanings are slow, which coupled with #5 and #2, lead to general unhappiness.Any future Epson products I will test drive before buying. On the plus side, when the printer prints, the results are pretty good."
2,Ordered love seat got chair,"The chair I recieved did not have arms. Not happy! Notice, I said chair not love seat!"
2,nothing sensational,"Do yourself a favor and read other essayists. I got nothing out of reading this, and stopped 3/4's of the way through."
1,Damaged goods,This used book was described as like new. The front and back book covers had been sliced with a razor blade. Several pages were sevearly dog-eared.
5,James D. Doss,"I love the Charlie Moon series of books. The characters are all brilliant together, and they make me wish I lived in that area of the country."
2,Disappointing,"Not a single menu photo or recipe graces the pages of this book. So little food info is included, in fact, that this book is just a dry recitation about the diner structures themselves, and the occasional interesting tidbit about the people who owned them. This leaves you hungry to know about the food they served. After all, the food is what diners were all about. If you want a diner history WITH menus and recipes, this is not the book for you."
3,a muscial interpetation of certain thoughts,It's unfortunate that this work has left out everything that relates to some things. I recommend it for many individuals yet would caution some people to avoid it. It has a grasp of the essential yet it bases everything on a faulty epistemology. I would suggest that people either use this or use something else. It is a theological/musical exposition on the end times that connects you to the present.
2,overblown and overwritten,"I have no doubt the writer is talented and intelligent, but why does he have to keep trying to prove it on every page?The book starts out great. In fact I purchased it after borrowing it first and wanting a copy for myself. MISTAKE! The characters were so poorly drawn that when I finished I still couldn't match the name of the two main characters. And the female lead is one of the most stereotyped women I've ever read in a ""well respected"" novel. The prose is sometimes funny but eventually goes on and on trying to impress. It's a thinking man's, thinking man's soap opera. This would have been much better 200 pages shorter."
4,Interesting,Mulisch has a way of causing deep thought and contemplation for me. This book certainly fit that description. I am still trying to decide if I like the ending.
4,Captivating!,"In Dark Corner Massey puts a new spin on an evil entity, like it or not it makes for a captivating story. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read. However, being a die-hard horror fan ... I was left with many questions. I know it's fiction but even then, there's a how and why things happen. Regardless of the questions, I still enjoyed the book. I just may be a little too inquisitive."
5,Being from Mississippi....,"....and a PROUD graduate of Jackson State Univeristy. I may be bias in my review. However, I think many would agree when I say this was a good book!!! I was looking for my first suspence/mystery book to read and I am glad I decided on this one. It through me off at first because I felt trying to implement the unreal (vampires!!) in a this book was not going to keep my attention span. Boy was I wrong!! Massey did a wonderful job on keeping you excited on what is going to happen next. Even though I have completed this book, I am still excited becasue I can not wait till his next book. Keep up the good work."
1,One Cliche After Another,"One cliche after another, on and on and on, this book just plods along. Brandon Massey's style is more suited toward young adult readers: cardboard, one dimensional characters moving through a cookie cutter plot that is highly derivative of 'Salem's Lot. Vampires run amok on a southern plantation sounds like a rip snorting yarn and the cover is great but this is one of the worst ""horror"" novels I've read in years. I passed this around to my black female co-workers and even they agreed it was geared more toward readers with a junior high reading level and was padded with too much business that had nothing to do with the storyline. A complete waste of seven bucks."
4,Good Read,"I am not a horror fan. I like pyschological thrillers. I enjoyed this book though because I see it more as psychological thriller. The ending was such a surprise. I never expected it.If you like books along this line, y'all must read Tananarive Due's My Soul to Keep, The Living Blood, and the Between. They must be read in that order. I am sure Brandon knows who she is. She is a sistah and a down home, but sophisicated writer and story teller.Good job Brandon."
4,Took Me A While...,"I went through a little brain damage getting this thing to pair up with my phone... but that's probably because I didn't take the manual literally when it advised to hold the answer button down for a full 5 seconds. :) I kept seeing the blue light flash and would release the button, not realizing I needed to hold it down until I saw the alternating blue/red lights flashing, indicating it was in pairing mode.Now that I have it paired, I think I'm in love. Fellow drivers in my city can now breathe a sigh of relief that I am hands-free in the car."
5,Great bang for your buck,A quitissential tool in any American Kenpo Practicioners arsenal. Highly recommend a copy of this in your library for quick reference of terms and history.
4,The Prophetic Ministry,"I have not read this book yet, therefore, i really can't commit on it yet. I do think it may help me to find answers to what i am looking for."
1,No difference...,"Have been on the product for a week, haven't noticed any changes. I am up to 6 tablets a day of Phase 1 (this is the maximum they recommend) and nothing, if you know what I mean! I am taking two tablets a day of Phase 2. I will continue with the product for the recommended time, and report back if anything changes. Update - changed from 6 tabs a day of Phase 1 to 4 a day, kept on with 2 tabs a day of Phase 2, finally noticing a change. Not significant as promised, but definitely more regular than normal. Downside is noticeable increase in gas, yuck. Will keep on the product for the recommended time, probably will not purchase again. Would change to 3 stars, instead of the one I originally gave it."
4,Peacock moving forward with this one,"I like this one a lot, much less pop, more alternative. Always liked the fact that Charlie makes you want to move as you listen...Bummer that Amazon doesn't carry it!!"
2,Legends in their own minds,"Overrated is the word that comes to mind when I think of this. Can any collection of songs sound anymore similar than these? All I can say is, you hear one you hear them all."
3,Spray Chalk,"Purchsed this item to temporarily mark some sports field lines. It does what it is advertised to do. However, the spray line is thin and their isn't a lot of product in the can. It is a good way to temporary (3 to 4 days) mark pavement or grass."
1,Works occasionally,"I've had the S20 for several years. It suffers a lot from ""communication lost"".The software upgrades do nothing to solve the problem.Buying expensive cables does nothing. Re-installing software does nothing.Adding high quality USB ports does nothing.Swapping computers (at least five different machines) does nothing.Once in a while it works and then it works adequately.You can tinker yourself to death with this one."
2,Perlman's poor tempo,"I have not listened to all of the tracks on this recording. However, I have listened to the Kreutzer Sonata recording. Perlman holds the tempo down ( you can hear Argerich wanting to go full speed) in the first movement- devastatingly slow IMHO. It is evident through the rest of the Kreutzer that the two performers were not on the same page and most likely didn't provide enough time to practice. Dissapointing."
1,Worked for 2 hours,"This product started off great but after 2 hours of use it just stopped reading disc's,"
5,A Place to Call Home,"I ""discovered"" this author while browsing on the Kindle collection. I enjoyed her so much that I have ordered several of her books and each one is especially enjoyable. It is so nice during these snowy times here in PA to curl up with my Kindle and one of Debbie Smith's books."
2,Disappointed!,A wonderful first half outlining the special bond between the hero and heroine as they grew up. I couldn't wait for them to be reunited. But as adults they didn't have the same chemistry and the plot becomes very contrived. Ultimately I had to force myself to finish this one.
3,Chemistry Faded in Second Half,"The first half of Deborah Smith's A Place to Call Home was such a heartfelt story, and the reader had a real connection with the characters. Two children, Claire Maloney, a spunky, out-spoken five year old from a respected family, fell in love with Roan Sullivan, a boy 5 years her senior, struggling with family abuse and neglect. Claire saw beyond Roan's circumstances and befriended him, something no one in their small town had the courage or the desire to do. Their growing love story touched the reader's heart.Unfortunately, I did not feel the same chemistry between the characters when they were adults. The author wanted the reader to become invested in their continuing relationship, but it simply fell flat. Where the first half of the novel flew, the second half dragged."
1,"This is no ""how-to"" book","I was fooled by the title of this book. I thought it would have some useful information on how to self publish, but this is no ""handbook"". Instead, it is a book of anecdotes (circa 1970s) of other people's ""personal woes"" and what led them to become self publishers. If a person is full of self doubt and in need of being ""emboldened"", they might be better served to read one of Anthony Robbins' self-help books to muster up some courage. If you really want to self-publish, skip this book and read Dan Poynter's informative self publishing book."
4,Walt,Works great except if you want to use a long distance calling card with a phone number. It only store 24 digits. Per the phone rep. their model 2080 allows you to get to your phjone directory after sending the card numbers from the phone directory.
5,Getting Lucky,"Another fun read from Susan Andersen! Light and fluffy, but with characters you'll love. Well worth the money and easy to read again and again."
3,Not Skintight,"This book should have been more fun. I loved the author's Skintight about a Vegas showgirl, but just couldn't keep this one going. Lily is the well-rounded heroine and Zach is the tough marine who misjudges her. A lot of effort goes into converting Lily's chubbiness into bombshell voluptuousness, and although I liked her gumption, I found it hard to see her as a femme fatale.The search for Zach's sister and her fiancee, supposedly kidnapped, stretches the reader's credulity. Lily never expresses much concern for her missing friend, while she and Zach indulge in romantic hi-jinks. Lily's shopping trips, and effort to makeover the sister of the missing boyfriend seem pretty trivial when supposedly a dark and twisted scheme is underway."
3,Andersen's Trilogy,"Boy, I have been an avid reader of Susan's books. I generally can't wait for them to hit the shelves of the bookstore, so I may purchase them. However, Getting Lucky wasn't what I had hoped. Somehow the sexy sizzle and snap has vanished from her characters recently.This book has all the elements for a good read including lovable characters, sex, and danger. The circumstances in which Lilly and Midnight meet feel forced. And then knowing the background from the USMC (from which I was raised) this seems extremely far fetched at times. I don't know too many marines like the one she based Zach on, or for that matter Coop from the novel's predecessor. I also felt that the plot moved incredibly too quick and began to feel pushed and far fetched at times. The ending was set up rather quickly in the beginning of the book, unlike her earlier work. I must say it was not the page turner like all her other work has been."
4,Great read!,I loved this book. I especially liked the interview style it was written in. It was like reading a series of short stories. I like anthologies so this worked well for me. Overall great book!
3,Not exactly what I expected,"This is not a light read. If you are looking to be entertained and have fun, this is not the book for you. However, if you are looking to be depressed about how much human beings have digressed, and daydream about what it would take to reunify the human race, then I suggest you pick up a copy of this book...it definitely made me think. Read more of my review at: [...]"
3,Try it (3/5 - Ok),"I don't get the hype around this book. Yes, Zombies. Ok, I get it. But still... I don't. If you are into zombies, you should give this a try. If not, I wouldn't bother. It's ok."
5,Fantastic Global Perspective on Zombie Apocalypse,"One of my favorite books. I was surprised to see that someone who read it with a book group gave it a low review. I think this book lends itself to great discussions whether with a book group or with high school students, possibly those who claim they hate to read maybe...you can discuss social class, culture shock, cultural differences, religion, leadership, economics, technology, altruism, and so much more and of course the question ""what would you do?"" It was a very fun read and difficult to put down. I cannot wait for the movie."
3,Interesting Frame,It's okay. I'm interested how the movie treatment will turn out. It's hard to go back and forth to the glossary on my kindle. Footnotes would have been better.
4,Solid zombie story,"I am not typically a fan of zombie stories or books. This one caught my eye. At times the story is gruesome, but told in a way that is more realistic - if zombies were to appear. This story is from the point of view where the author is someone who witnessed this event and chronicled it throughout. Very interesting."
1,"0 character, 0 plot, 0 narrative drive","Because of the format of the book there is no way for this book to be compelling. Each chapter is a news-like ""interview"" with a different person and their role/reaction to the ""Zombie War"". As a result of the author's approach there is no main character to root for, no plot to follow and absolutely no narrative drive to compell you to read further. Not only that but many of the interviews all sound like they are coming from the same person --there is little variation in ""voice"" despite the fact we are supposedly hearing the events from a different character with each chapter. Also, there is little concern whether the characters will survive the zombie war; since they are being interviewed ten years AFTER the end of the war they obviously survived.This really could have been good. But because of the author's choice of approach to the material, it really is doomed."
1,waste of time,"So promising, but turned out to be boring.Protagonist was totally inept to learn how to do things even though he was supposed to be intelligent."
2,Average at best,How is it average? Basically the narrator goes around interviewing the survivors. I knew that this was the structure of the book before hand but it was very boring. We know that they are the survivors and you don't care for any of the characters.Blah.
1,Not worth the read.,"I don't see why this book is so popular. I was totally bored after the first 15 pages. 100 pages in and I had put it back on the shelf, not even worth finishing."
5,Terrific book,"I won't repeat what others have said, but I do want to add that I think the succcess or the book is due to the clever piecemeal presentation. The story of World War Z would be too huge to present as a novel. By breaking it into smaller stories told from the perspective of very different survivors (all with incomplete information) Brooks was able to make it manageable.I think it would make a lousy movie, though."
5,One Great Ride for Zombie Lovers!,"I was so pleasantly suprised by the quality of Mr. Brook's second book. He clearly has done his homework with so many little details in this story. His understanding of governments, military equipment, geography and human nature are all evident in this story. This creates a rich tapestry on which to superimpose an epidemic of undead cannibals.One of the best aspects of this story is that Mr. Brook's has truly taken a world's eye view of the conflict. He relates narratives from sources all over the globe including China, Japan, Iran, Indian, the Artic and the good old USA.A good yarn, if maneating reanimated corpses overrunning the world is your thing!"
2,Zombies minus suspense,The writing was competent and the stories were interesting but every story teller lived to tell his tale so there is no suspense. We don't have enough time to get involved in the character to care that much in a tale we already know the outcome to. I enjoyed the graphic novel the Walking Dead because I never knew if a character I cared about would live to the end of the next chapter. The life on the edge heightened the relationships between the people. In world war Z before we could care a little bit it was over.
2,Just Zombies,"This book is supposed to be a collection of stories from the perspectives of the worlds inhabitants as the world falls to a zombie pandemic. There isn't any more to it than that. This is a book where the author seemed to just jot down whatever story fragments he could think about a world at war with zombies, and then threw them where he thought they belonged in the book.Despite all accounts belonging to different voices, they all speak with the same one. The author in fact seems to think that writing in this fragmented mode excuses lack of care for characterization, or any over arching story. After a point I really had to question why I was still reading, I still don't know what the endeavor can glean with this book. I put it down and moved on to Warm Bodies, which was a much wanted reprieve, it at least having characters."
4,"An interesting read, but something you could never really get into...","Because of the way this book was written, it was hard to get fully immersed in the story as there was no main character or main story to follow. It did do well to make the reader think of other ""Zombie"" scenarios that normally would not be imagined, like a sea floor teeming with the undead."
2,Meh,"""A compelling thrill to read with a sauce of touching love all over it. This book is a goodbye to gross sadness and a hello to a moon setting over a bay of compelling literature."""
