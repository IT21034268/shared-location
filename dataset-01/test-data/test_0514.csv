4,Groovy Baby,I was sorta skeptical about buying this book. I love NASCAR but I didn't want to read a book that had a racing theme that wasn't realistic. This author knows her nascar. The characters were believable and funny. I love humor in a romance.I have not read the first book yet but plan to buy since I enjoyed this one.
3,ok flux wire for the price,The price was right and the fast shipping worked out just right for my needs. There are better brand name flux wire companies that produce better results and with a lot less spatter; but if you need it fast and cheap this will work every time.
4,"Good, but no Wagon Wheels","This CD is growing on me every time I listen to it. It's not my favorite Old Crow, but if you love OCMS, like I do, you're gonna have to get it. I think the CD gets better after after the first several tracks, but I don't know....even those tracks are getting more and more play lately."
5,Old trunks,I redo old trunks and it is done with bent nails not screws so this is the tool . Works very good
4,Can't beat the price!,"Not a professional set by far but for the price coupled with free shipping this set would be tough to beat. The dolly surfaces needed some minor touch up to get things smoothed out, radius was okay on one plane, the other had some cupping, nothing a ceramic belt won't clean up in 5 minutes or less. I can imagine the factory dude in China grinding away for his 5 cents to get these done quick. The hammers also needed some minor work, inconsistent radiuses on the head, but again for the price, and a little work, these will match up with those high end sets for triple the money. I like at least one hammer without a crown, these hammers are definitely NOT machine ground, just a guy at grinding wheel so you won't have well machined surfaces. That being said, they are not very far off from getting them just right. Nice plastic case as well. Well worth the money."
4,Lovely music for lovers of romanticism,"Der Rose Pilgerfahrt (The Pilgramage of the Rose) is a cantata based on a fancifal poem about a rose who becomes human, with the various joys and tragedies this can involve. The music is quite lovely and the singers, conductor, and orchestra give it an outstanding performance. I played it the other day and liked it so much I immediately played it again. My only caveat is that both the music and the words (sung in German, in which it was written) are from the height of the Romantic period, in the first half of the 19th century. I love this style of music, as I love much of the music from throughout the 19th century. Unfortunately, this type of music is largely out of fashion these days and many modern listeners may find this work to be too sweet or even silly. On the other hand, any music lover who is not biased against this type of music may well find this recording as delightful as I do."
3,Great Photos!,This book has great photos but I was expecting more information about the people who built the different styles of barns. The background information is really missing in this book.
2,Would not buy again,"They are small and awkward to handle. More expensive than any other pin I've seen, and they are ineffective on a thin line (such as my folding Brabantia clothesline). A couple of the springs popped off within the first week of using them. Also, misleading ad on amazon.com -- The quantity in the package is 1/2 the quantity sold in other packages. Can't recommend."
5,heart-feltedly performed,"i've enjoyed this CD collection for a while now ; of course, it's a baritone singing the whole thing, so all the songs are in the necessary lower key ; but he portrays the character songs with such personality, that even if you're not following along with the translation, it's easy to ascertain the gist."
1,didn't flow,The stretching itself were ok... but the video did not flow. Music should have been instrumental not with words. disappointed
4,Not happy,"I ordered the product, but the order arrived wrong, Two bottles of Royal Copenhagen colonge, is what I ordered, and received two different Royal Copenhagen products. I contacted the dealer and returned the wrong colonge, and was advised that it had been received and would be inspected, and then was informed that I was correct and that they would be sending me the corrected order, It is now Dec. 1st and I am still waiting for my order to be completed, can some one help speed the process? Thank you, Malcolm Lax"
5,The tradition continues....,"Following in the footsteps of the earlier editions, Ogami Itto continues in his slow but unfaltering quest to reveal the crimes of the Yagyu. And the Yagyu are aware... In this issue Itto and his son Diagoro face a Yagyu dragnet, a lone samaurai from an execution past, a young woman willing to give her life to avenge her family, and Diagoro witnesses the murder of a princess. Amid the varying side plots the intensity continues to build - how should a lone man and a young child with no material resources continue against the odds of a clan, luck and life pitted against them ? This is again, a fabulous book...."
4,Great goggles!!,Great goggles worked great for what I use them for. I bought 2 pair for me and my wife and they were excellent for Steam punk wear.
2,Toggle the opinion of the goggle,Good lenses. outer frame is hard and uncomfortable plastic. Fits uncomfortably on the nose.
3,hurts the nose,The chain looks kinda weird and they really pinch your nose. words words words words s s s ss s
4,4 Stars,"Overall, I really like this product. Once the length between the lenses is adjusted it is much more comfortable. Since I will be using this as a costume piece rather than for its intended purpose I can't speak to its functionality ."
3,same old song and dance,"I only read the track listing and I can tell you that I won't be buying this right now. I might buy it later on, but the songs are SOOOOO overplayed right now. They are the songs that you switch from one station to get away from and find that the station you switch to is also playing it. It's fun to listen to my old NOW CDs, but I am so sick of all the songs currently. I like the idea of these albums though."
1,help yourself,"First off, if you like any of the artists on this cd, there is something wrong with you already, secondly, if you want to buy a cd, why not pick your favorite artist (or rather sex symbol)and buy their cd instead. This is a shameless attempt to make money...but unless you're here to mock the cd like i am, you probably won't listen. Buy Mudhoney instead, its better pop music."
1,Total Garbage. Not worthy as a coaster let alone as a music collection,A group of untalented hacks. Computer altered voices without any range. My eardrums are still recovering from this monstrosity. Buying this cd is equivalent to throwing a 10.00 bill down the toilet.
3,Save your money :-l,"I gave this 2 stars for the variety of songs here, but I took off 2 stars because these are almost all tired songs. They are now overplayed on radio and if we here them again, ...The good songs like Check On It, Yo (Excuse Me Miss) and What's Left Of Me can't even save this cd. The overplayed Bad Day and S.O.S don't help either. Putting out cds like this, just give big record companies a chance to get more money from us. If you love these songs, buy them from the artists. Sure this is a good way to get variety on a disc, but most songs are old and tired and should be put to bed."
1,HELLRAISER CAN GO STRAIGHT BACK TO HELL,"WELL GUYS,THIS ALBUM IS PURE REFINED TRASH,SO HEED MY ADVICE AND STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS ONE.WELL TRUTH HURTS.AVOID THIS AND GET MASTER OF PUPPETS FROM METALLICA INSTEAD.NO STARS."
4,clears up much confusion,"I like this map because it is very clear and goes into great detail. In making plans for my upcoming trip I keep coming across different street names and points of reference on different maps, and using this guide I have a touchstone to cross check other maps with. I was just a little disappointed that there wasn't any mention of walking tours, and walking is discouraged in this map. If I was worried about walking around where there might be poor air quality I wouldn't be going to Bangkok in the first place."
2,Sent me the wrong map. I order a map of Chiang Mai.,"I dealt with Amazon and was confused as per their instructions to mail this back. I complained to them what a hassle this had become over a map. Then allowed me to just keep it and still get the refund from them. That was nice of them.I have been to Bangkok and have several maps. I am going to visit Chiang Mai and am disappointed that I did not receive the map that I ordered,and won't do business with this seller again."
5,Wonderful and colorful map!,"I am definitely glad we purchased this map of Bangkok before our trip. We used it help plan our itinerary and we used it frequently while in Bangkok. Nancy does a great job of telling local secrets and best options to choose from. It is very well done, up to date, very colorful, and I am 100% satisfied with the map. It is a little different than what I am used to, but it was a nice change. Thank you for the great product."
5,Very useful!,"I have been in Thailand once before. This map shows all the good places & much much more!! This may not be a good map for the first timer in BKK, but very useful and colorful map for people who love visiting BKK."
4,It is a sad thing,"When I heard the Five Iron was breaking up, I was crushed because I loved Five Iron from the start! Iwas trying to decide whether or not to but the cd because I was wondering if it was good or not! I finally went out and bought, and let me say thaat Five Iron Frenzy has done it again for the last time! This Cd is amazing, funny, and cool sounding. It is just sad to see them go!Farewell Five Iron Frenzy"
5,"The end is here, but even in death FIF is still awesome!","Wow, their final cd. FIF has come such a long way, now don't get the title wrong. The members of FIF aren't dead, but the band is. The first disc: The end is near, is one of their finest studio productions. lyrically speaking, it is awesome.The end is here, their live album is amazing. actually, I really can't describe in words, because it is excellent. Get it, you won't be disappointed."
5,FIF Paints their Final Masterpiece,"This album is so unbelievably creative, FIF really outdid themselves. The only track I had heard before buying the CD was Cannonball, which is an amazing song. Next is my favorite track, ""At Least I'm Not like all those other old guys"" which combines a really cool guitar riff with a really cool horn part and really coool lyrics. Other good songs include: See the flames begin to crawl, new year's eve, farewell to arms, cross of st. andrew, and basically the whole friggin album."
2,Good place to start but......,"If you are interested in learning about the world of professional golf and the best way to break into that world, this book is a good place to start. It pretty much has the same information that can be found through many hours of internet searching on professional golf careers, but this book has it all in the condensed format. I found it very helpful in educating me in previously unknown areas of the golf world that I was then able to go out and research and learn what I needed to know. This book is far from what you need to get into the professional golf world, but it is not bad for a first step of information."
4,Good Value,The end tables are a little low. I didn't anticipate the nesting element of this product. I'm very happy with the coffee table though. Also was very easy to put together.
1,why fly that way?,"The book may have been fine if I would have even received it. However, I am yet to receive this purchase and my final paper over this book was due 3 days ago...I am never purchasing on amazon again."
2,Not worth seeing !,"This is another typical example of the seemingly endless horror movie trend. Just in order to make money we are constantly inundated with cheap, redundant horror flicks that are for the most part simply boring and cliche like. This is, unfortunately, no exception to that irritating rule. Another mindless horror film, that is supposed to be a sequal. Well, don't fall for it, unless you don't mind wasting your time with cheap DVDs."
5,GOOD TOY,"So this toy i just got was one of the best and cheapest godzilla toy i have ever bought. It said that this package was going to get to my addres on the 15 of this month but it got here 6 days before that day so 2 tumbs for that. The toy has very good detail, i bought this toy for collection only i did not buy it so i could play because im to old but if you have kids and they love godzilla then here is something you want to get them. this godzilla looks ecxacly like the godzilla in final wars. i really recomend this toy 5 stars"
4,Tautological success,"Viewing your stock as you would the products you sell, and trying to woo shareholders as you would potential customers offers the ultimate offers ""win-win"" situation, but only if the shareholders so selected continue as passive consumers. Brancato's strategy largely assumes shareholders add no value other than their strictly financial investments. That's like thinking the only value citizens add is paying taxes. Still, this is an important book."
1,Fluff; no english.,"I do not believe that either of the authors has a degree in English. Seventy percent of the book addresses generic, contempory, ""teaching"" topics; the remaining thirty percent addresses language arts in the same mere, topical manner; feel-good fluff; no english."
1,Red Eye Pen did not word at all,I bought the pen to get the red eye out of 100 Christmas photo cards. It did not work!! It turned the red eyes green! Tried on several card and didn't work no matter what I did.
2,Psycho-scholar babble,"You can always take facts and put any spin on them you'd like, if you have an above average command of the language.Yes, there was definitely a cover up. So what? Our legacy is the truth within us. Remember this: It doesn't matter who the messenger is; what matters, is the quality of the message.My advice, leave the wordsmiths (or Pharisees) to prattle and blow hot air 'til they're blue in the face."
3,"Couple good songs, but nothing to remember","This CD isn't bad really. It's just not that good, either. There are a few pretty good songs that I've put onto mix CDs, but there's nothing on the entire CD that really stands out.And she needs to make more of her ""doo's"" like in her Cranberries days. It's difficult to tell the direction that she sees her music going - soft rock? Alternative rock? Pop? Personally, I'd like to hear her sing songs with a bit more profound lyrics, too."
3,No doubt.....,"No doubt that Delores has an amazing voice. Musically, the album is not as good as expected. There are some glimpses of perfection- like the song ""When we were young"". Otherwise, it's a little overdone with a lot of songs sounding the same. I think Delores does not show all of her raw talent in this effort, but I think as a solo artist she'll continue to grow and I hope she does. She's unique!I still prefer the Cranberries over this- but life goes on huh?"
3,Total Well-being Diet by Dr. Manny Noakes,"Interesting but not easy to achieve; seems to be a system half-way between GI index and Atkins, some ingredients need adjusting for UK"
2,A big yawn,"If you are into ethnographies where lots of words have ominous quotation marks around them, then this book is for you. If you find post-modernism a whole lot of nonsense perpetuated by people who see Al Gore as a deep thinker, then you may just pick up a used copy of Let's Go Japan or Lonely Planet-- more readable and useful that this ""ethnography"". All those poor dead trees which died for this book...Shame!"
4,Great charger,This charger works great and I was shocked at how inexpensive it is for as many batteries as it charges. While it is rather loud from the fan I think the extra safety is a great trade-off. I was also very pleased with the service from Hardware Sales Inc and received the item very promptly. I'd really give it a 4 1/2 rating if available.
5,Four symphonies by Carl Stamitz,"The Stamitz family - father Johann and his sons Carl and Anton - were prominent in leading or performing in the Court Orchestra at Mannheim in the 18th century. The orchestra was noted for the quality of its playing but also for the concertos and symphonies composed by the Stamitz family. These were vibrantly exciting works for their day and still stand comparison as concert pieces with those composed by their contemporaries, Mozart and Joseph Haydn especially, but also lesser known figures such as Christian Cannabich, Johann Baptist Vanhal or Michael Haydn, brother of Joseph. It was the range of dynamics in the works played by the orchestra with such talented players that particularly earned them their reputation of being the best Court orchestra in Europe. If you enjoy listening to the music of this period, this CD of four symphonies by Carl Stamitz played by the London Mozart Players directed by Matthias Bamert for Chandos will delight."
5,Great Music,"I first heard about the artist from my brother in Maryland.Salisbury is the town.The band was playing there and selling a cd sampler and my brother picked up a copy for me.Well the rest is history, get your self a copy today you will like a combination of blues and rock.Enjoy. sister2@bellatlantic.net"
2,Not worth the time.,"This work was most certainly not up to Ms. Grafton's standards. Most of the book is nothing but filler. I found myself skipping pages of uninteresting details--the same stuff over and over. The plot was weak and boring, and the ending non-compelling. Grafton readers should skip this one."
3,Enjoyable Read,"Grafton's writing style in H is for Homicide makes for light and entertaining reading, as always. For this reason, I will always cosy up to a Kinsey Milhone adventure for laughs and adequate satisfaction for content. I don't agree with other readers that there was no plot! The plot kept me reading - insurance scams like this one make you sympathize (for once) with insurance companies! Great Read!"
2,Unrealistic Snoozer---Not Up To Grafton's Usual Standards,"Kinsey infiltrates an insurance scam ring that turns out to be run by LA gangsters with Touretts syndrome. She puts on some trashy clothes and bad makeup & they just invite her in for a beer. No way. I've read every one of her books, & this is definitely the least believable or entertaining."
3,"H is for Hostage, not Homicide","From the title and the early entry of a dead body, the reader thinks that Kinsey is going to set out to solve a homicide. However, she gets tangled up in a most unusual situation, as a virtual hostage in a Latino run auto insurance fraud ring. This is the only alphabet book I have read where Kinsey is not working for a client, and I guess this is part of the reason I thought this book was sub-par, by Sue Grafton standards. There is little mention of the usual Santa Teresa characters. Even so, this book was an easy page turner, as all other alphabet books are. If this is your first Millhone mystery, don't worry. Most of them are much, much better."
2,Weak Link in a Great Series,"I read A is for Alibi years ago and did not get pulled into the series. Years later I read S is for Silence and was hooked. I started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning. I have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine (and forgiven Ms. Grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6"" frame). However, I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best. You just can't believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few. The dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous, and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics. But even with these issues, I did finish the book. Grafton at her low point is still a good read!"
1,'H' for Homicide falls flat!,"I am a devoted Sue Grafton fan, but, unfortunately, I don't agree with the majority of reviewers on this effort. 'H' for Homicide is, in my humble opinion, the worst of the alphabet series. It rambles aimlessly before it comes to a frustrating and disappointing end. Readers know who the perpetrator is no less than 100 pages into the tale. This is a wasted, poorly advised writing by Miss Grafton."
2,needs work,"pros: Easy to assemble.Some parts work fine.cons: When using the car launcher ramps, seldom does the car make it onto the acceledrome. My kids just place the cars there manually.Hot Wheels should play test their games to make sure they work as advertised.Very noisy."
1,Lack of quality kills this otherwise cool toy.,"There was a time when Mattel's hot wheels toys were amazing and high quality. Now the marketing is high quality and the toys are not. This was a Christmas gift for an 8 year old. His 12 year old brother put it together in 20 minutes. After 10 minutes of play, 1 launcher broke. In another 5, the second launcher was broken. Two adults were unable to restore either launcher to working order. No mechanical engineers in the family, but it shouldn't require one to get more than 15 minutes of play from a toy."
1,Oh... my nerves...,"My mom said I should always look for the positive... well, it's easy to put together. One of the car launchers seems to be broken, it won't catch. I install the batteries and turn it on.OMG!! this is the noisiest toy EVER meant for indoor use. My son and I will be returning this to the store. I just hope and pray he heeds my encouragement to choose something quieter and not a working version of the same thing. If not, I will be either be cowering in the opposite end of the house or seeking something soothing from a doctor."
4,Don't You Understand - I Suck?,"The reader will finish with their mind full of intriguing information about Asperger's Syndrome. However, as an uncle to a twenty year old niece with AS, I didn't find what the information important to me. I wanted to know how I could improve my relationship with her. How should I talk to her? What do I say when she is always so negative? When she says, ""I suck,"" as a fact, not wanting you to try to make her feel better, then what? When obvious truth is shrugged off, what can be said or done? The book seems like a great tool for parents seeking to help their child, but what if the child never got help and is now twenty like my niece? I'm searching for a book that has some advice or help in situations like these. I believe there must be many people longing for a practical book to help improve relationships with AS family members, and if not - somebody please write it!"
5,Great Resource,"A clinical Psychologist recoimmended this book to me to help me get a grasp on Asperger's Syndrome, which my grandchild has been diagnosed recently as having. I found the book to answer questions that other sources failed to address. It is a handy reference if you do not wish to read it cover to cover, but I will read all of it. It distinguishes Asperger's from other forms of autism on the spectrum and is more empowering than other books that dwell on the more dysfunctional ranges of autism. It raises questions that still need to be addressed about categories and approaches to the diagnosis. It is easy reading and it is a great resource for someone who hears terms being used without any reference points. Lillian Beeson, Ph.D."
4,Very informative,"This book is a more technical read about Asperger's Syndrome, but is a must read. Great descriptions and suggestions from the author. Parents of children's with Asperger's will appreciate this book."
2,DONT BOTHER,"As with almost all books written by ""professionals"" this is for professionals who sit behind a desk and have unreal image that ""teachers"" and the school systems are actually interested in helping your child; they are usually seen as a problem and troublemaker to them. Parents, grandparents and those trying desparately to help the little ones, I was hoping to get some ideas and ideas on how to help but as with most books written by professionals only technical terms not dealing and treating the syndrome. I have also found how truly ""uneducated"" the school system is about how to handle these situations. They are even less knowledgeable than I. Do not buy this if you are looking for help for your child. It is too clinical and in no way a help to you."
3,Very Informative but Heavy reading,"This book is packed with well-researched and documented information. The author is authoratative in his knowledge on the subject of Asperger's Syndrome and lays out information that will help anybody who is willing to take the time to read this book. I recommend this book with the following caveat: It is heavy, in-depth reading but it is laid out in a style that anyone with a high school education should be able to follow; it is not for the faint of heart yet not written so that only a person with a Phd would be able to comprehend it either; although I suspect there are many doctors who should read this author's works and get their heads out of the pharmaceutical clouds."
1,Dull and Dry,"What a sappy story line. Guinevere was just as pitiful as ever, and Arthur was a dummy in this book. Mckenzie writes an easy and simple tale of the king/queen saga that can be found anywhere else. The book was huge, which made it worse to read. Get MISTS OF THE AVALONS."
1,ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ!!!,"Yeah, the Guinevere point of view was different, but I passed throught this book idly, it kept dragging on and on; surprised I didn't doze off in the middle.I like these feminism books, where the females point of view is taken instead of the usual male ( Try THE FORESTWIFE by THERESA TOMLINSON, taken from Maid Marian's point of view instead of Robin Hoods. I found The Forestwife much more enjoyable. the foreign words and old English dialect, it felt like I was in their age and time, unlike this book)."
1,FLY SWATTER HITS DOWN ESSENTIAL POINTS TO A GOOD BOOK,"A dull trite novel with not enough details for emotions and surroundings. In creating a lasting loved book, one needs to let the reader feel and understand and also become perplexed with the character and story itself. Mckenzie has picked up a fly swatter and hit all of those essential points for a good read down in a toilet. Though, for an amateur writer, The Child Queen is pretty original... if not bad. What else is there to say about this pointless book?"
2,2 Stars: as much as THE CHILD QUEEN is worth,"The typical average ho-hum female falls for king story. A pretty interesting book to start off with, the only positive thing I could see from my point of view was that the author decided to use a female instead of a male as narrator. Overall, an average book if you can't find anything else worth reading."
1,What middle age life!??!,"The Child Queen is by far the first book that I have come across that I can't decide what category it belongs in. This isn't the TRUE fantasy type of reading most fantasy readers would enjoy. There wasn't the highly anticipated war or the round table. Many of the key elements that have been in the King Arthur tales have been left out of this novel, a big mistake. If some light research was done, the writer could have added very much needed details in that would have had readers think, "" Hey, this is a pretty well-rounded novel."" There was the occasional romance, but Child Queen was more of an emphasis on the love between Lancelot and Guinevere, not King Arthur."
2,Too Small!,"I use a large format camera and I was looking for more magnification under the hood. I was not expecting tiny piece, it's half the size of the 8x Peak Lupe I already own. Don't let the picture fool you, it's too small for me."
3,Product description should be in detailed,"Hi Support,This product which I bought from Amazon has a less description, which made me come to conclusion that the ROD is made of metal, I was assuming that the ROD will be good. After receiving the package,I came to know that the ROD is made of wood, which was a disappointment.Kindly give a detailed description of the make of the item so that customer do not have to get disappointment.Regards,Sikander"
5,Shimano FXC 2-Piece Medium-Heavy/Fast 6.5' Casting Rod,"Just got the rod yesterday, and opened it today. No problems. I haven't used it for fishin yet, but it seems like a pretty decent rod. Looks nice, feels good in the hand, reel seated without issue. Now I just need some fishin line, and I'll be set to catch big ol' Okeechobee bass!"
4,Lexmark x4530 all in one printer,The printer is great. easy to set up but a little large than my old lexmark. it is a little slow in printing especially with the wireless hook up. otherwise the printed pages are crisp and neat. I wish they would find a way for inexpensive ink because with 2 ink cartridges is quite expensive. how about refillabe ink cartridges.?
5,"Great recipes, great variety","This has become my favorite of the dozens of cookbooks I own. My family and I have enjoyed very much every one of the recipes I've tried -- I haven't come across a single dud yet!The recipes also include very complete nutrition information, which is helpful for those watching what they eat.I can't recommend this highly enough!"
3,Not as great as I thought it would be.,"My hair is on the dryer side since I've been coloring it in the recent months. As I know Phyto is a good product, I expected to notice a difference in my hair soon after starting to use this shampoo. Unfortunatlely, I haven't noticed any difference compared to other shampoos, and I think I need to choose a different shampoo in the Phyto line. I still love their products and am not going to give up on them yet."
3,A good reference though,"The author i think did well in supporting his view and the way he did it for me is quite good. However, it really did not met my expectations when i was just intending to buy it. I hope that he had explained everything more deeply and more theological. What i have observed is that he more or less just gathered all the texts that can support the subject being treated but have not established it doctrinally deep. Not much a work of a theologian for me, but it is a book that one should have in his shelf."
3,A must for the Poe fan in the house,"Overall, Quoth is effective in carrying on the spirit of The Crow. A greater appreciation for Poe comes from reading this. I have since looked up the works of Poe to get a better understanding of his influence. Quoth lacks development in some key areas, but gives a very good read for the average Crow fan looking for more Crow related tales. The ending turns into a soupy mess (literally), but the prologue saves the ending. We are given a look into what happens to the Crow's avenged victim after death. It is a very satisfying end from the victims standpoint."
2,Very poor mounting system,The bags are decent enough and a good size but the mounting system is shoddy. It just has hooks and a bungie cord. It should have come with velcro securing straps which would have been easy enough to design in. I would have paid the small increase in price to have these there. I find this could have been a great product if it had a better way to secure it to the bike.
4,Entertaining Toy,"My boys (2 and 4) got Gorilla Attack for Christmas. I also could not get the arms to move, but called Mattel and they told me to make sure the Gorilla was flush against the base of the toy. Once I snapped it into place, it works perfectly."
3,Almost good,"I have the same problem as Glen. It was fairly easy to put together but the gorilla's arms don't work unless you sit there and push him down. The track works great, though."
1,Bad toy! Do NOT buy.,"My 6 year old son got this from Santa for Christmas. Like so many of the other reviews, the arms won't move. Mattel should be ashamed for making such a useless piece of junk. Don't waste your money on this."
2,broken in 40 minutes,"My son got this as an early Christmas gift and although he seemed to enjoy playing with it, the gorilla head broke after 40 minutes of play. The latch on it somehow doesn't work now and so the gorilla head won't shut and therefore the toy is useless. I will see if amazon.com will take it back but this was a big disappointment, to say the least."
1,Irritated!!!,"We bought the Gorilla Attack for our grandson. The box says assembly instructions @ www.hotwheels.com/H2247_Gorilla Attack. Google had no listing. An hour spent searching Mattel, Mattel hotwheels assembly instructions, Mattel hotwheels Gorilla Attack, Mattel hotwheels Gorilla Attack Instructions, Mattel hotwheels Gorills Attack Assembly Instructions, the same leaving out ""assembly"", Gorilla Attack Instructions, the same adding ""assembly"", and many other options failed to get any assembly instructions. Thanks for leading us astray! What do we do now?"
2,Son liked....Mom not thrilled,"My 10 yr old enjoyed playing with this for about 2 months or so (kids!) 'Hot Wheels' usually make good products, but I wasn't very impressed with this item's durability."
3,Good for infrequent use,I received an orange colored grinder. Not the black model shown in the picture. No big deal. It works OK. Made in China.
2,"Save your money, unless........","I was a huge fan of the Rock Star INXS TV show so I bought this CD. But unless you're a bigger fan than me I would say save your money. There were a couple of good songs on the CD, but the majority of the songs I enjoyed on the TV show are not featured on the CD. This CD is not worth the price."
2,Unenlightening,There was nothing enlightening about this video. I suspect most normal adults won't find anything new or exciting about the content.
3,9 June,"If you are in the mood for one of those really creepy ""film as you go"" horror movies like blair witch, cannibal holocaust and others like it, this will do. It's not very gory or bloody until you get to the end, but it does hold your interest because you know something is not right and the characters are headed for a serious payback for their juvenile pranks. I would recommend this for a saturday night viewing with friends of course. I may add it to my horror collection"
2,Good While it Lasted,"I'll give the unit a star for every year in use. I gave it 2 stars because that is long it has lasted. Bought the frame as a Mother's Day gift and my mom has enjoyed it. It was affordable and easy to use but it has ""crashed"" for some reason after 2 years and it looks like I'll be buying another frame. It was cheaper than most (around $40) but obviously not built to last. My mom did have it on 24/7 so that may have contributed , but there was NOTHING in the manual that suggested it be turned on/off daily."
3,Gurnemanz - 'No Rays Of Noise' (Garden Of Delights),"First released in 1977, as this was the German progressive band's third of three actual lp's they had put out. You get the eleven tunes from the original album + eleven bonus cuts - that are in fact 'live' recordings of their never released 'Blue Moon' 1979 effort. Didn't blow my mind but but this CD reissue didn't exactly bore me to tears either. Some songs I sort of liked were ""John Barleycorn"", ""Morning Song"", the laid back ""Rain Song"" and ""November"". Line-up: Lukas Scheel - guitar, mandolin & banjo, Wolfgang Riedel - guitar, harmonica, flute & vocals, Siegfried Bushuven - bass & lyre, John Cremer - autoharp and Manuela Schmitz - percussion, kazoo & vocals. Total of twenty-two tracks with a duration of 77:52. Might be tough to find."
4,It was well detailed but it had a few problems.,It was written well enough that I'd like to find the sequel but I'm not completely impressed with it.
5,Must read,Burnum Burnum provides a heartfelt and thoughtful guide to Australia from an Aboriginal persepective. I love this book and it has been my constant companion on my Australian wanderings. Read it if you get the chance.
5,memories of survival,powerful book as well as the added gift of fiber art that the writer used to illustrate her experiences
4,Good information and learning tool,As usual Kevin puts out a simple to understand and follow along lessons and a good ref to always go back to as needed.
2,"Not worth your time, unless you've never used RoboHelp","I'm a relative newbie to the world of RoboHelp, even though the application has been ""sunset"" by Macromedia/Adobe. However, I've been ""lightly"" using the application on and off for about 3 months now. I purchased this manual in hopes that it would fill in some gaps in my knowledge.Unfortunately, I literally had to go to the last chapter before I found anything that I didn't already know.This manual is laid out like a manual you would get in a training class. The cover is so thin, it ripped the first time I dropped it. It covers all the major topics, but only to the point of saying, ""here's what it does, now you do a simple tutorial."" It does little in the way of in-depth instruction.Like I said, if you're very, very new to the application, then this might help you. However, if you've been using for more than two months, then this manual is probably too little too late.CS"
5,Feinstein scores a touchdown,"Feinstein, one of our best sportswriters, has another success with this new book that focuses on the Baltimore Ravens during their 1994 season. Even if you're not a Ravens fan, this examination of an entire year with the team will be enthralling. Feinstein was given access to everyone, from Steve Bisciotti, the new owner, down to players who tried out to play in one game. He gives background on each coach, staff member and team member as they come up during the season. No team member is the focus of the book. Feinstein's intention is to show that football is a brutal sport in which each man knows they are expendable. If they go down hurt, go to another team, or get cut, the team will just reach for the ""Next Man Up."" One of the best sports books of the year."
1,sea life camera review,Owned two of them. The second was a piece of junk and it replaced the first which was also a piece of junk. Don't waste your time or money.
1,Too sweet and too expensive,"I did not care for these energy bars. Even with all the healtfull ingredients, I thought they were too sweet(chunks of maple sugar) and too expensive. I preferred Rawvolution Energy Bars."
5,"A Tapestry of Ethics, Corruption, and Friendship","Reman descriptively weaves a tapestry of ethics, corruption, and friendship into an exciting tale. Characters are well-developed, realistic, and simply likeable. Reman's personal knowledge of, and expertise in, corporate finance is injected into the story, bringing a greater legitimacy to the characters and their circumstances. Ethically, we should all ask ourselves what we would do in similar circumstances. The Iron Horse Club is worth the read!"
4,An Accounting Thriller? It Works,"This is a well-constructed story about white collar crime. The narrative revolves around four friends who started together at a major accounting firm and are still close friends 24 years later. The story is dramatic, it looks at how perceptions can vary from the inside and the outside of a corporate scandal, and it shows how good people can get caught up a scandal through no fault of their own.This is a good story for any reader, but I would especially recommend it for accounting or business students because it provides another perspective on some of the topics that can be pretty dry in the academic setting. It also puts a human face on the issue of white collar crime."
3,Decent beginner orbital buffer,"If your just getting into auto detailing as a home consumer, this product isn't bad. The ON/OFF switch is a bit quirky and at times difficult to use if your only using one hand on the buffer and the other holding the cord.The second issue is with the bonnets, the lambswool bonnets that came with the unit both get soiled extremely fast, and basically are good for one use only. The foam applicator pad couldnt get on the buffer without tearing, I never used it. I purchased this unit with a 6pack of microfiber bonnets from autogeek on Amazon, so I wasnt concerned about the supplied pads, but from B&D; they should supply better quality pads.If I were doing it again, I would not buy this product, but look for another 6"" - 7/' orbital buffer."
3,Not bad for the money,"I used this today to wax my car, and used a microfiber cloth to wipe it off. It's so much better applying wax with the buffer than by hand! As many others said, after I finished I tried taking the foam applicator bonnet off, and it fell apart. I think 6"" bonnets are quite easy and cheap to come by, and as I use synthetic wax on car car, I only have to wax it once or twice a year, so this really isn't so much of a problem. But after using this I will never apply wax by hand again, this is so much better."
4,The Holy Roman Empire: Great,"Although this book may not be the greatest ever written, it is one of the best n regards to the Holy Roman Empire. It accurately goes through the rise and fall of the empire and also goes through the modern day descendants and title-holders. It has an entire chapter on the Schwarzenbergs who are made to be some of the most interesting people you could ever read about. A rarely, if ever heard of family. Also the input of Napoleon is greatly expanded upon, especially with his fall the fall of the emmpire itself.A definate MUST READ."
3,"OH NO, This thing is HUGE! It Doesn't need to be this HUGE!","The Telrad Finder works very well for what its design to do. My beef with this finder is the enormous size of it. IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THIS HUGE! The unit is 8.5"" Long by 4.5"" Tall at the sight. When you open the unit to put the batteries in you see a cavernous body of wasted space. I'll need to take my Camera mount off just to fit trhis unit. If your scope is less than 15"" long (ie ETX 125 is too small), I would pass this finder up. It's strictly for the BIG BOYS. I did some measuring of the wasted space and it could be re designed down to 4"" x 3"" with absolutely no loss in optics or finding ability. If you have a small personal telescope, I'd search for RED DOT finders."
2,loss,"i found this book ok - my loss was a stillbirth little boy - the book is very good for people who got to keep their child, at least for some period of time - my baby left this earth before he even got here - i read the book and repected the losses in it but for my loss it really didn't help me much!!"
4,Good one,Author Joe Vitale suggested I get this book and I am glad I did.The chapters on Jonathan Mizel and Joel Christopher were worth the price of the book.Sure there is a back end offer but there is enough information to get anyone started. There is also enough information to help the experienced marketer.
5,"Rugged, compact, and dependable","I have used this screwdriver almost daily for 5 years in my line of work. I carry it in my tool bag and it travels well. Its light, compact, and does everything I ask of it. What did wear out was the power supply to charge the screwdriver. The cord started breaking right at the transformer. I got a generic replacement from Radio Shack and over the course of about three months it fried the battery in the screwdriver. I've got a Milwaukee screwdriver but for me this B&D; is a better tool. I've been looking in the stores for a replacement but was not successful. I finally checked B&D;'s website and found this model is still available.If you need a power screwdriver that will work consistently well, has multiple torque settings, is rugged, and compact you will find the B&D; 9078 exactly what you need."
1,Slower than molasses,It's slow in every way possible......charging the battery takes a good half a day and using it as a screwdriver makes you want to just use your philips instead.
3,Bouchard Attacks California--Who Knew?,"This book fills a little known niche in American history. It's short, not complex, but still fills the bill for information."
1,Worst product I ever purchased,The stand collapsed and the lights wouldn't stay on. Even tapping the top or sides of the magnifier would bring them back on. A complete waste of money.
2,"smells good, that's about it","This shampoo and conditioner smell fantastic. And that's where the good stuff ends. The shampoo is sooo heavy, I have super thick hair and even the smallest amount of shampoo leaves my hair very heavy. Plus it has sulfates- bad shampoo, bad!"
2,Drying,"Lucky for me, I had purchased this product while it was marked down. Good thing too. The shampoo and conditioner dried out my hair. I have color treated blonde hair. The good side to this product is that it smells nice."
2,Super clean,"This shampoo does it's job. But I feel like it's actually stripping my hair of moisture.It lathers A LOT, so don't use too much at one time.The feeling of the mint on your scalp is nice. and it doesn't smell too bad either.My only problem is that when your done, your hair feels super squeaky clean (bad, all your natural oils are gone) and it tangles my hair (I am Black with natural 4a hair).Iam still using it for now. I don't hate it. I just wish it were a little more hydrating, like the bottle says.Maybe this would be better used as a clarifying shampoo?"
4,Skeptical,"I am always looking for shampoo that will do what I want. I've tried numerous salon shampoos & drugstore shampoos. Every time I read the label of some product that says that it will do exceptional things to my hair, I usually am quite skeptical. I read a little bit about Organix on their website & decided to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised. I always figure the more expensive the product is, the better the product will work. Organix is medium priced & it works very well. Its smells yummy! The shampoo feels clean, like its taking out the other products I put into my hair. The conditioner softened it up and detangled my hair. I have only used these products once, but so far so good."
2,Not Impressed At All,"Still trying to figure out how a product containing coconut milk, coconut oil and egg white proteins can leave hair dry. You would think that with those ingredients it would leave your hair on the oily side. Not so with this product.Color treated hair comes out dry and in desperate need of a leave in conditioner. Even after using the matching conditioner, you will still need to seek out a leave in variety just so you can comb through and style.A product that I do not think I will be using again.Back to BioInfusion Hydrating Shampoo a great product for softness, shine and volume."
5,Shampoo,I just love this stuff! Has a great coconut scent and leaves my rather thin hair fluffy. Get the conditioner too!
5,i love the coconut shampoo,"i'm disappointed that fewer locations are carrying this wonderful shampoo. I tried mamy other sulfate free shampoos and none worked beyond 30 days before making my hair feel gooey and dirty. This brand however, has been wonderful for 5 months now. i have lots of thin limp hair, i get highlights to add some dimension, and since using this shampoo, have less breakage. I hope they don't discontinue!!"
1,Does not perform,"I purchased the Vanilla shampoo and conditioner because it smelled great. That's where the products performance ends. The conditioner is useless if you actually need it to soften your hair. I have long straight hair - so honestly- it does not take much. I cannot get a brush through my hair after using this conditioner. The shampoo further drys my ""normal"" hair type which you can feel when washing in the shower. The only thing that is soft & silky are the words on the bottle. Girls, the product smells nice, but it does not work, which is unfortunate. Don't waste your money."
1,not digging it,"this shampoo actually drys your hair out, which is suprising because teatree shampoo is supposed to have moisturizing properties. who would have thunk!"
1,Good scent but cheap quality shampoo,I was attracted by its coconut scent. But was very disappointed after the first use. It is just a cheap shampoo. Leaves your hair dry and hard to comb. It's a waste of money! Fekkai is much much better for my damaged hair.
2,let down,"pro: love love love the smell, it transported me to a tropical oasiscon: I'm glad to see from the other reviews that I'm not the only one who experienced this, thought I was going crazy, it had such potential with all the ingredients that it claims to be in it, my hair was hopeful, but was immediatley let down. I was left with dry brittle, frizzy hair, I tried using a little more, and it just left alot of build up in my hair even with my clarifying shampoo. Its too bad, they need to do some re-formulating"
2,So disappointing!,"I was so excited to find an organic, sulfate-free, cruelty-free shampoo that smelled like coconuts.....my favorite scent! How disappointing when I washed my hair for the first time only to discover this delicious smelling shampoo had turned it into straw! I washed 4 more days, hoping it was a fluke. Nope - dry and frizzy...gross! For reference, I have fine hair - but a lot of it and its color-treated."
1,The Worst- DO NOT BUY,"I paid over 6.00 for this shampoo and would not pay a dime for it again. The packaging is very nice, but the product is worse than any I have ever used. This is my first Shampoo or hair product review for that matter, but I was so disappointed, I found it worth my time to warn others. This did not soften my hair at all. The conditioner was awful. Will not purchase again. Do not waste your money. Poor quality."
4,good for the price..,"I am a guy and have used this product for about two years. I have short hair, maxing out at just over an inch before I get it cut again. I wanted a tea tree shampoo because it smells like a guy's shampoo and it wakes you up in the morning. I started buying this product because my local Albertsons has it and I generally don't buy shampoo until I am out lol. That said, I have turned a few friends onto this shampoo. Yet, I have since stopped using it for the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree which in my opinion is a better product. If you are going to get your shampoo on amazon you may as well splurge for the few extra bucks for the better stuff and order Paul Mitchell's.*Edit: I would go to a local salon for the Paul Mitchell shampoo (if you do get it). This product is much better than the (what appears to be) knock off of paul mitchell that the 3rd party on amazon sells. I went back to this and tossed the two 33 oz bottles of Paul Mitchell because they were so bad."
1,Makes my hair super dry,Got it on a friend's recommendation - never again. Strips my hair of all oils - much more frizzy than before.
2,"Smells Good, Wasn't a fan of the product though","I've been going through a coconut obsessed phase, so I decided to try this product when I came across it in the store. The product smells amazing, but that was the only thing that kept me using it. I have thick wavy hair, its usually very soft. While washing my hair with this it made my hair feel like it had a ton of tangles in it, and off course after getting out out of the shower it did have A LOT of tangles in it. My hair has never been prone to tangles so it was quite weird. Since I have switched to another shampoo and conditioner of the organix brand, the brazilian keratin treatment one and I love it and no longer have the problems with the tangles :)"
5,Best of 2006!,"Now, I know that is saying a lot and I am an avid music listener of many kinds of music. I am sorry that more people do not know of this man who did the lead singing and guitar playing for the 21st Century Schizoid Band. If you run across this, don't hesitate. Even if it doesn't become your favorite out of 2006, it will become a clear overall wonderful, inspiring listen."
3,The AKC Complete Dog Book,"Many years ago I obtained a copy of the AKC Complete Dog Book, and it was a BEAUTIFUL compilation of all the recognized breeds and descriptions as well as great color photographs on the center pages of ALL the breeds in action. This new book almost feels ""cheap"" to me. The paper is flimsy and some of the photos appear very ""out-dated"". Maybe it's just me, but the portraits of ""Purebred Dogs in Art"" does not impress me. I guess I should have researched the year of the copyright, as there have recently been quite a few newly recognized breeds to the AKC."
3,The humanistic side of golf,"I guess you would call this a book on golf philosophy. Although I should not have been surprised at the general approach of Extraordinary Golf, nonetheless it didn't appeal to me. It started out well on topics that I could see might help me enjoy the game more, such as how to overcome the constant feeling that I'm not playing well enough. But then it slides into softer topics, like how to have closer more meaningful relationships with my golfing buddies, etc., etc. Hmmmm. Not for me."
2,Not many real games,"I was disappointed with this one. The Big Book of... series tends to be hit-and-miss. This one's a miss. There seems to be a shortage of actual games, and a lot more ideas for how to get a good healthy discussion about Topic X. If that's all you need, this may be a good one. I was looking for actual games and activities...found a lot of them in Miller's Quick Teambuilding Activites for Busy Managers. But all the activities in that book are short, so if you need anything to last more than 15-20 minutes, try Ukens' All Together Now--some of them are longer (for retreats and other long meetings)."
1,Not at all what was expected,"The book contains nothing that will be of value to our organization. In fact, most aren't really games at all. I was looking for some fun activites to motivate the staff and I should have spent the money from this book on cookies instead!"
3,My daughter likes it,My daughter really likes this movie. I am also a fan of Hello Kitty but she whines way to much in these stories. The lessons are good but also can be a bit scary learn through fear type of stuff.
1,Hard Plastic Hard to cut and use,"I returned this as soon as I got it due to how useless it is. The plastic was rigid and very thick which is good but makes it hard to cut. The main reason I did not like it was the 2.5"" size did not line up with either end of my shop vac, it was either to big or too small to fit."
5,"Don't have doubts, buy it!","It's amazing, just plug and play and you will have a very quiet and reliable device to store and backup all your files. I'm using it at home with Windows XP Home Edition SP2. You don't need any additional software nor drivers."
5,excellent book[nuf said],Pretty good book. Giant pigs and redneck hillbillies toting shotguns make for good book to read. The part at the near end with Zac and the hacksaw was a nice addition to this wonderful book. The grossest part was when they described the Sirs bathroom and it was described well if not gross. Read this book for an entertaining time.
5,A very useful book,I am working on my theses of doctoral grade and found this book very useful for my methodological work.
3,The sell-out has officially happened,"Back when cowboys didn't dance, didn't wear designer shirts, didn't have a massive hit with Amazed and go off the rails of the crazy train chasing cash Lonestar was a good band. Sadly, the sell out following the well deserved success of Amazed has caused Lonestar to get lazy and their music has suffered. This cd contains many of the bands early neoclassics, but is weighed down by the overly radio friendly dreck that has followed their massive cross over hit. The new songs on this cd are the epitome of what is wrong with this band now--too bland, too coy, and too over-produced. It's a shame, really, because they really had something at one time and Richie's voice is so full of character. Mark Cohn would be rolling over in his grave if he were dead at the bashing remake of Walking in Memphis. The first 7 songs on this disc should be in any fans collection. But, the rest is pretty much pure garbage."
4,good,"This is a remarkable greatest hits album. With songs like ""Amazed,"" ""Everything's Changed,"" and ""My Front Porch Looking in,"" every song on this album is a winner. I enjoy listening to it and recommend it to anyone who is a country music fan. I dare you to disagree."
5,What's the import worth?,"While not as great as their original album, the Gravediggaz second offering The Pick, the Sickle and the Shovel is still a 5 star offering. The key difference between the american album and the import are 3 remixes of songs already on the album. Two remixes of one of my personal favorite songs off the album, The Night the Earth Cried, then a remix of Unexplained. The songs are all of the quality that you would expect from the Gravediggaz. The songs are good, but they really don't offer anything new, only being remixes. The question you must ask, is are the 3 extra remixes are worth the bloated price increase? Unless you are a huge Gravedigga fan, or are lucky enough to find it someplace that offers it at a regular price, it isn't worth it. Stick with the stateside release, but definetly pick up this album."
2,Not as described,"The description clearly states sand filled, the one i received was not... It is a nice bag, if i had ordered a plastic filled bag I would give it four stars. I woud return it but it's probably not worth the hassle and shipping!"
2,Below Boston Average,"La Peste's sound is very average compared to other bands that came out in the late 70's-early 80's. Their single ""Better Off Dead""is the best track here period. The other songs are disappointing and boring."
5,Super cute,"Its my favorite chair and color in the office. All the girls fight between the pink, blue, and purple ones! Easy to assemble, though some of the wheels don't easily roll when moving across the room."
4,Good Quality,"The stool is very sturdy, and has a smooth swivel as well. The lift seems to be of high quality. Though, as other reviewers have pointed out, the seat is quite slippery. I recommend this stool! It has a bright and durable finish on the seat, and for around $35, you won't find much else to compare it to."
1,STOOL,"COLORS ARE NOTHING LIKE WHAT IT SHOWS, ORDERED AQUA COLOR AND GOT BRIGHT DEEP GREEN COLOR HAD TO RETURN FOR A DIFFERENT COLOR"
3,"I really like this, but it isn't very functional if you want to roll around.","I love the way this looks. The assembly was a breeze. It is nice and small yet still supports my weight without an issue at 165 pounds. Also you can't beat the price. However the wheels don't roll very well, which wouldn't be the worst thing ever, except that the plastic on the seat is very slippery. It makes for comical and awkward scooting. Stationary it is very comfortable and I decided to keep it. I'd just be cautious with children or the elderly. I had someone in my office scoot themselves right off of it."
2,Slippery seat,Love the chair but I slip off it alot. The seat is too slick. I have fallen off on the floor several times.
4,IT DOES THE JOB!!!!,"LOOK VERY NICE AND SUPPORTS EVEN A 235 POUND PERSON LIKE ME, THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE IS THAT WHEN THE SEAT IS ELEVATED TO THE MAX AND U PICK IT UP BY THE ROD, THE GREASE FROM CYLINDER COMES OUT JUST A BIT AND GETS YOUR HAND ALL GREASY , BUT NEXT TIME JUST PICK IT UP FROM ANOTHER POINT, WOULD DEFINITIVELY RECOMMEND IT !!!"
4,love it,sleek and comfortable. lightweight and sturdy. i'm using it for bodywork and it is easy to slide forward on it when working which is the only reason i'm not giving it 5 stars. I really do love it. The purple is great.
5,This book could have changed my life.,"Loved the book. Many examples of different kinds of invitations. I wish they had this book back when I was in the 3rd grade and I gave my girlfriend (even though she had the cooties) a Valentine's day card. Maybe we would have got married instead of her throwing mud in my eyes. Oh, what could have been..."
4,Good product,"These pillows are nice, everything that the description and reviews said they would be. Not too firm, not too soft, just right."
2,"great music, great pianist, terrible recording","No one can deny Richter's brilliance, especially as applied to the notoriously difficult Liszt repetoire. Unfortunately, this monaural recording was made live in the '50's and the tape hiss is more audible than the upper piano register. Another reviewer (RBS) noted that the sound quality was not great (!); actually it is terrible. I don't know enough about sound engineering to know if remastering would save it; it sounds as if it were taped with one mike."
2,I have had better,"I used this product when I was at the beach for 4 hours. It was pretty much useless. I applied before going into the water and every time I came out. I had to have put it on onece an hour or so. I ended up with a bad sunburn that I thought the product would prevent, but I was wrong. Maybe I just got a bad bottle or two seeing as everyone else likes this product, but from my experience I would not recommend it."
5,Will Change your life,"Although its one of the more deep english that I have read, this is a beautiful read! Definitely worth it."
1,broke after 15 months,I loved this printer until it started making an extremely loud clacking noise 15 months after I purchased it - just in time to be out of warrenty.Online help tried to push me into buying a new upgrade printer and had to ask three times how to get it serviced using thier online caht which took forever. Then finally told me its $79.99 to service the printer. Seems a more envirnomentally friendly option than throwing away a printer and buying a new one.
5,just a good printer,"very easy to review: reliable, fast start up, fairly fast printing, no paperjams, accepts all kind op paper thickness, good print quality. And not expensive at all"
5,Great laser printer for the money,"I purchased this printer for $46 after rebate. This printer is great. It's fairly quiet, prints relatively fast and has a small footprint. I was using this on a laptop running Windows XP and today, installed it my new laptop that is running Vista. The Vista installation was quick and simple and I did not encounter any problems. After 4 months, I am still on the original toner cartridge that came with the printer. I do not do alot of printing....am the average home user who occasionally does some ""work related"" printing. The print quality is quite good especially for a printer in this price range.You won't be disappointed with this one. It works as well as it's ""sister"" the higher priced LaserJet 1020 which I also own."
3,"Nice, but get the stop light style one instead for $10 more.","I got this 2 years ago locally, and it works fine for me - it moves a little in my garage so I glue it to the ground with heavy duty caulking, no movement since ;). I have to open my door too see it on my new car because I can't feel the bump going over it. No big deal.My garage is huge, so I sometimes get my car pulled in at a different angle, in that case this is kind of useless, but so are all other related products in that case.However, seeing as it is $15, and the stop light style sensor one is product $25, get it, then you don't have to worry about the mat sliding. I have it in my other garage and it works beautifully."
2,SLIP MAT,"The matt tends to slip around alot, maybe my cement should be rougher. I had to put marks on the floor to keep putting it back. Dont know quite how to fix that,."
2,Not completely thought out,"Nice pen when everything works on it. But once I ran out of lead, I couldn't refill it. Tried several times but have no clue how it's done. Love the stylus though."
4,Decent pen,"Pros:-Writes well (better than a Bic, not as well as a Pilot G2)-Writes while upside-down (space pen!)-Feels well-constructed and has a nice heft, without being heavy-Functional and comfortable while still looking nice (not a pen to ""impress"", but definitely classier than a disposable)Cons:-None, really..Other:-To choose a color, you have to turn the pen so a specific option is facing up. Gravity-based instrument selection seems like a weird choice for a space pen.-The only colors from Fisher seem to be Blue, Black, and Red. I could buy a refill from another brand, but could I write with those refills in space?-The stylus option is a little anachronistic these days. I would have preferred another color of ink instead (I'll probably swap this out)-After getting used to the smoothness of a Pilot G2, going back to a medium tip ballpoint was a letdown (the ink flows smoothly, so this is not really a complaint - just an observation)"
1,System Backup always fails,"I just bought this from Amazon last week. I never can backup my system. At the end of process, I always get en error. It says ""Access Violation at address 005CD31E in module PCCloneEX.EXEI read all people comments before I bought this, but I wanted to try it by my self because the price is so cheap compare to other brands. Now, I don't know what to do with this drive. It's so BAD. My suggestion, don't buy this one!! Spend litle bit money, but you will get better one!"
2,"OK Hard Drive, SO SO USB, worthless Software",The bulk hard drive is OK - not fast enough but OK. - its says USB 2.0 but its performance is more like USB 1.0 or even slower. The software that comes with it is practically worthless - the easiest way is to manually drag & drop hard drives into this drive.
5,Good Product,Good Plug-n'-Play storage device. We keep all of grand children's pictures on the device. To date we have had no problems.
2,Carolyn Westbrook Home,"This book was not as good as I'd hoped it would be. I guess if you're buying a book based on the photographs, you should see it in person first.The decorating style depicted in the book leaned toward ""cottage"", of which I am not a huge fan. The text was helpful, however."
5,Amazing!,"After two years of having permonitions of friends deaths and going through horrible episodes of nightmares, Stacey's nightmares persist once again. A young girl, named Clara, is currently staying in the same area as their beach get-away that Stacey and friends decided to rent out before going to College. This time the main character Stacey is dreaming of Clara's death, and does everything in her power to save Clara, even though Clara isn't very well like by anyone in the house.This book was truly amazing, it was full of shocks, laughs, and tears. The end is very unexpected and caused me to cry. Everything in this book is very well written, and I think it is Laura Fairia Stolarz best book yet. Once I got the book I never put it down and read it all at once. This is a must read for all people who enjoy reading mystery novels."
2,High Fructose Corn Syrup....,"I bought one pack from the grocery store for my baby to try.When I look at the ingredients, I can't believe it contains High Fructose Corn Syrup.....I will never buy Gerber snacks again!"
5,Hurricane Lamp Blows in as a hit,The lamp looks good works good got it with time to spare and the wife likes it...Thanks
3,Sturdy build but smaller bikes did not fit,"Sturdy build but smaller bikes did not fit. I do not understand why description does not specify bike sizes that would fit. In fact, none of the bike stands on Amazon mention what size bikes would fit."
4,A decent bike stand,"Pros: Compact and doesn't require wall installation. Easy to assemble. Does the job of holding bikes upright, outdoors in our very windy area.Con: The stand is very lightweight and will stick to fat tires, which could add a couple of seconds to the removal of a mountain bike. To avoid this, I step on the base of the stand with one foot then pull the bike out. You might consider drilling the stand to the floor or filling its hollow base with sand or rocks."
3,"Decent product, quality questionable","This bike rack is sturdy enough and works fine for my purpose, but it is a flawed design and of low quality. The bars were warped when received, so several of the screws would not fit into the holes (after much effort trying) because they were so out of line. The screws also stripped quickly, so I suggest not tightening them fully until finished because there's a chance you won't be able to unscrew them. It's definitely just an ""okay"" product that I wouldn't purchase again--I would purchase a higher quality bike stand in the future."
1,Do NOT Buy,"I would recommend against buying this. The one I purchased was missing an entire type of screws (6 of them), so I had to go to Home Depot to get them. A major pain."
2,Mechanical Degree to Assemble :(,"I am very disappointed with this product. While the instructions state 25 minutes to assemble I spent over an hour with it. While assembly is not directionally difficult I had to assemble and re-assemble it 3 times and the the screws/attachments are still not ""flush"" and tight. As a matter of fact, the support bar will not tighen completely which only suggests to me it is only a matter of time until it starts to fall apart. I would opt for another model/brand/maker."
3,Bike Stand,"It is as it appears. Basic but functional. We are using it as a basic bike stand in our basement AND as a bike stand on a basic trailer with no modifications. We just put the stand on the trailer, put the bikes in/on and strap them down and all seems to be secure and has worked fine so far."
1,Lack of Quality control,Welded nut was stripped. Hassle to return too. Can't anything be made of quality anymore?
1,doesn't fit disc brakes,"Doesn't fit my 26 inch mountain bike. If I put the front tire in it hits the disc brake, If I put the back tire in it hits the derailleur. It looks like it is sturdy and would work well with other types of bikes, just wanted to let people with disc brakes know that they should pick a different stand."
1,This is JUNK!!!,"This is a very poorly designed product. Received it today. It must have been designed and machined by drunk chimpanzees. Main issues: 1)the parts do not fit together cleanly 2) it is obviously designed for small childrens' BMX type bikes, not adult bikes with full sized wheels 3) if you do store 2 adult road bikes you have to interlace the handlebars, necessitating removal of both bikes to ride one 4) adult mountain bikes ae out of the question unless you use the back to back set up option which doubles the length of the space required (think, amount of space that you would normally store your SUV in) ."
4,"Good product, great service","These bike racks are easy to construct and seem quite sturdy. For adult bikes without disc brakes, they work very well and seem well-constructed. Smaller (i.e. kid's) bikes don't fit quite as well as adult bikes. They tend to flop over if not placed very carefully, which of course no child does. They work slightly better for kid's bikes if you use the back side of the rack instead of the front, which was suggested in the manual.What really impressed me was the customer service. I purchased three units, and one had a defect in the curved rod in the back which prevented it from attaching to the other parts. I called the service number and the call was answered immediately by a helpful woman who ordered a new part UPS'ed out to me in a matter of minutes at no charge. English-speaking help, no phone tree, done in minutes -- it's what you'd expect and hope for, but rarely actually get when it comes to service these days."
2,Defective parts,"Product arrived quickly, but I soon found that it could not be installed according to direction. The holes had been bored on the wrong sides of the metal pipe! I ended up keeping it and using it, but mine ended up missing the back two support railings. The stand still is quite sturdy, but I'm sure it would be a fantastic bicycle storage unit if all the pieces had been able to be used properly! I want to believe that the unit I received was a fluke, and that they're not all flawed..... but there is no guarantee!"
1,A misfitting nightmare,"Poorly aligned bolt holes create a bike stand that won't even sit flush on the floor. The whole thing is ""sprung"", or misaligned once it goes together, with brute force, I might add. Easy to strip out the allen wrench recepticals on the screws. After working with it about 2 hours, I may have to send it back. If you find one of these already assembled, it might be worth buying, but spare yourself a lot of misery. Overall, poor quality control. Also, all the screws, washers, and tools were floating in the box. Lucky they all made it without getting out."
3,Works well...,"Once the rack was correctly assembled it works very well and is a good value, takes little more floor space than the bikes themselves, and is easy to get the bikes in and out in either direction. Some gripes: the four rubber caps the go on the corners of the rack are that super smelly cheap coal based chinese material. They smell like gasoline and never outgas. I threw those in the trash. The little box wrench that comes with the rack did not fit over the bolt heads. My 15mm pedal wrench worked just fine. The instructions were fair, and it is easy to install parts backwards and not notice until the end. It is very important to loosely pre-assemble every fastener and then tighten them a little at a time in a criss cross pattern untill every thing is tight."
4,Solid for the price,It's a good way to store my bike & my wife's bike in the garage without hanging them. Good price too.
3,Didn't quite fit.,When putting the rack together some of the pieces didn't fit. Customer service from Racor is top notch - they shipped out new parts and all was well.
2,the direction wasn't clear enough.,"Took me over an hr to know the assembly direction. Also, the set suppose to have holes for connecting with screws and wasn't any holes. the wrench was very primitive and hard to work with. I used my tool to assemble. I am not happy for the quality overall. I could get better one with this price."
4,Nice Rack....!!,This is a great inexpensive bick rack for the garage or back yard...etc I highly recommend it. It is pretty easy to put together & is sturdy...for the money
1,not great,"I agree with the other reviewer comments. The pieces don't fit together correctly.... a lot of bending and prying to get it together.Also -- my wife has a cruiser bike... I think the tires are 27"".... and it doesn't fit well.Also - ditto on the disc breaks.... If your mtn bike has disc breaks.. this rack doesnt work."
4,Need to adjust for MTB Dics Brakes,"Good product. Takes about 10 minutes to assemble. If you have a mountain bike or other with disc brakes, make sure you spread the outer wheel insert bars to provide enough spacing for the rotor. This took some effort to spread the center portion of the wheel slot bar. Do this prior to tightening the screws on the unit. Also, you can opt to take a dish towel and fold it, and them wrap it around the top portion of the wheel slot (where the tire touches the wheel slot) and use zip ties to keep the bike stable and secure without hitting the disc rotor. With slight modifications, the stand functions very well without touching the brake rotors. Overall decent bike stand. This unit holds my Gary Fisher HiFi Deluxe '08 and Trek Madone 5.2 '08 without issue (except listed above)."
5,Inexpensive but works well,The Rancor two bike stand was easy to assemble and works as advertised. It is stable with two bikes in it. I had no problem fitting the two adult bikes with one in on the front tire and one in on the back tire. It really is worth the 20 some dollars to not have leaning bike all over the garage.
4,Great Bike Stand,"I purchased two of these bike stands to house four bikes. They work great. My son's bike is a little smaller so we turned the stand around so the wheel fits in better. We previously had our bikes hanging on hooks in the garage and it was extremely difficult to get them up and down every time we wanted to ride. The bike stands are easy, convenient and our bikes are always accessible, which makes us ride them more! The only negative is that the stands do not stay in place when you roll your bike in and out, but they are still well made and sturdy. I would definitely recommend."
5,Assembly instructions lacking,The instructions to assemble the bike stand were very lacking making the assembly time longer than it should be.Once assembled it is a great bike stand that is very stable and easily moved when not in use. We love it and highly recommend it for anyone needing a portable bike rack.
4,An entertaining supplement,"Not the best supplement for White Wolf that I've seen, but definitely useful and I like that they paid more attention to background and story than stats (though..check out the health levels for mundane frogs, I laughed). Get it if you work at all with changeling or the dark ages/Renaissance games."
4,"Premise somewhat weak, but portrayal of Grant is very informative","Despite the author's best efforts, I thought the premise of the book -- that Grant and Twain's friendship was of great importance in both men's lives -- was not well proven in the book. However, the intimate portrayal of Grant in this short book was very interesting to me, and earned the book 4 stars in my mind."
1,Sony Music: the empire of EVIL,"Warning! This CD may or may not be infected with the notorious ROOTKIT device which, when installed, can cause critical damage to your PC. This nasty little trojan holds your computer hostage and puts your safety in high risk. And for what? Copy protection? Sony has NO business treating us like criminals. We love music and we're doing nothing wrong! Nothing! Even if ""Born to Run"" isn't copy-protected, I still wouldn't buy it, because Sony is the most evil corporation in history. They're a bunch of crooks and thugs. Everything they do is vile! If Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, and George Michael left Sony, then you know they're bad!"
1,OMG,It's like there's only 2 songs in disc 2 that worth AT LEAST a listen..the rest of the tracks sucks until to where to suck!Whole album is so full of crap!!!30th Anniversary???how do you sell?
5,Worth every penny,"No concerns here. Many reviews were rough on the mix. I played them side by side and did not hear any glaring deficiencies.My ears may be shot or my equipment may not be pure audiophile, but it sounded fine to me.Packaging etc A+, DVD at the Hammersmith A+, DVD making of BTR A+. For a fan of The Boss, rock and roll or of a classic piece of music,go for it."
5,I don't care if you own 10 copies of Born to Run,"This is it!!! The release that shows the power of the E Street Band. Seeing them live in 75 is like a dream come true. Amazing from start to finish. If you have recordings of E Street shows from 75, the loose feeling that's usually there is gone. This is a band looking to prove something. They are working to overpower this crowd and they kick it with all cylinders firing. I am talking (of course) about the London Show.If I need to convince anyone that one of the greatest albums ever recorded needs to be heard, I'll give up without bothering. The only question should be is the Box set worth it.ABSOLUTELY!!!Give any old copies of Born to Run to anyone you know who doesn't get it yet, but buy this set.How else can we convince Bruuuuce to give us more of the same?"
1,Seems like cheap,"There appears to be lots of ""fake"" reviews for the Cavalry products... avoid this brand maybe? :)"
5,Brian Setzer Christmas Extravaganza - DVD,I first saw these guys way back in '96 in Chicago and have been a fan ever since and the Christmas thing is must for every Cool Yule. Awesome!
5,Setzer rocks ( of course) to Christmas music,"Ask any brass player if they like Brian Setzer. They all say ""no"" and then try to hide all of their Setzer CD's, DVD's, etc etc etc. I think they say no because he can PLAY ANYTHING and he plays it better than most! He never misses a lick and this album is proof of his virtuosity. The big band is as good as you will EVER find and they do a fantastic feature piece of Tschaikowsky's Nutcracker.My personal favorite is the trombone feature of ""Pipeline"". (Don't tell any of your trombone friends, though, it makes their slide stick when their chest puffs up like that).Highly recommended family entertainment! Great special features on this DVD, too.ps...pssst....Brian.....how about a Christmas Extravaganza 2 with the 'My Favorite Things"" live?"
2,Powers of Unethical Attorneys,"None of the main characters had any redeeming qualities. The heroine, Kate, was having an affair with a partner in her law office,with the carrot of becoming the next DA as incentive to continue it. The lawyers in the firm were unethical and underhanded, giving attorneys yet another black eye. Mimi Latt did a better job on her two other books than she did on this one. The plot and sub-plots were unrealistic and unsympathetic. I ended up skimming from the middle to the end, just to see if the characters got what they deserved."
1,Don't buy this dvd if you know have already seen this novela,"Soo much is cut out from this novela, there is no point of even buying it because the novela doesn't make any sense! I was very disappointed because I really enjoyed the novela on tv."
5,My daughter loved it,"In the first 24 hours since this book was purchased my daughter has insisted on having it read to her 7 times. No other book has had this affect. She wants to know what is holding up the next volume, and when is her dad going to get it for her."
3,Cracked CD Case,"This is my second request. I received the CD okay, but the case was cracked (broken). Please send a replacement CD case. Thank you."
2,Not exactly what I wanted...,"The only problem I have with this is the color was really more cream that white. Since there was no description about what kind of white#28 was.... it was disappointing. It's more an eggshell, cream or off white its definitely not white white.I would suggest to the seller to provide swatches of the different colors/#'s of ""white"" they provide and post it with each different white background so you can accurately select the correct color you need. Since I'm photographing dogs for a rescue its not a huge deal but if this had been for paying customers It would have gone back. The paper quality was fine the packaging it came in was fine. The tape used to hold the roll together was a pain in the butt to get off but not a huge deal."
4,Good Quality Paper,"Great quality, very thick and strong. I just used it with a motor cycle on top and was moving the tires around a bit and the paper didnt even tear once, very happy with the quality. The color is a bit on the creme white color and if the lights are a bit far, the color would start to look a bit grey. Nothing a little photoshop can't fix."
1,paper was ruined,"the paper was shipped on time, only problem was that the packaging was poor and there was a dent throughout the whole roll of what was supposed to be a ""semless"" paper. now i have to photoshop giant markings off the paper. huge dissapoint."
2,"It works, barely","This cable has been an adventure.1) The software drivers it came with were ancient and did not work on my Macs.2) The guy at tech support had not-a-clue about the drivers.3) I found the drivers myself on the Internet from the 3rd party developer who writes them.4) I had to inform the tech support guy where to find them. So you can personally thank me if he is able to help others in the future.5) Even with the right drivers, the thing loves to break its connection in the middle of a sync. It is not at all unusual for me to have to sync 4 times to get through a complete sync. That's BAD. Then again I have some syncs that work the first time. That's FREAKY.Essentially, this was the only cable I ever found that worked for my purposes. But it is a flaky gadget that requires the patience of a Microsoft user, and that's BAD. So use it if you must. It will work eventually."
4,Better than expected,"We never knew we had so much filth within our rugs and on our floors until we got this sweeper. It supplements regular vacuuming nicely, and picks up way more than we expected. We can even operate it when the kids are asleep!"
5,TIME TO PEE!,"Wish I had purchased this sooner. My grandson was already on the home stretch so the chart and stickers were useless. However, we did read it five times the first day and again the second day."
5,My grandson loves these books!,We have all the Mo Willems books (at least that I have found so far). My grandson is 3 and not quite into the potty yet. He finds this book amusing and not at all threatening.
3,Poor Workmanship on Part of Bag,"Overall the bag works fine. It organizes all my equipment, makes it easily accessible, and has a shoulder strap which I prefer to use. However, after only about a year and one half of light usage and not overloading the bag, one of the tabs that attaches a ""d-ring"" to the bag for the shoulder strap to attach to tore out. For this expensive of a bag and a quality name brand I certainly did not expect that to happen. It's very disappointing."
4,Canon CBC-NB1 Car Charger (Charges NB-1LH Battery),"Came in handy on a trip I made to North Carolina and my battery was getting low and threatened to shut down my camera, but with the help of the car charger I was able to stay out longer and take more pictures. And not have to go back to the hotel room early or stop taking pictures."
2,Poorly written,"This book was poorly written. The grammatical concepts were hard to understand. The book continues to follow the story of the Cornelii family, with the annoying pest, Sextus, and the stuck-up Aurelia. I do not recommend this book to anyone."
4,Moves a lot of air but noisier than stock fans,"Here are the specs for the Antec PRO 120mm DBB Case Fan:Ball bearing designVolumetric airflow: 79 CFMFan speed: 2,000 rpmAcoustic noise 29.8 dBABasically, this fan moves more air (CFM) than stock CPU case fans and at a higher speed (normally 1,000 rpm is average) but the noise is nearly twice as high (normal case fans are around 16-19db). So you'll get noticeable cooling performance but at the cost of noisier operation."
1,fat free is not calorie free,"When the fat is removed from a food, simple carbohydrates(sugars) are added to make the wonderful taste in these recipes. And sugar is the cause of most weight gain--not fats. Fats are misunderstood--especially saturated fats.I eat eggs, meats, half and half, whipping cream, sour cream, cheese, chicken fried in lard and coconut oil all the time--never do I eat any fat free or low fat foods, and I have my cholesterol checked yearly--last time it was a mere 155 total, and I have NO weight problems or heart disease. the lipid hypothesis is a big myth. Gary Taubes say it all in his book: ""Good Calories, Bad Calories."" But everything one knows for sure is found in his own experience, and I have found this to be true in my own life experience with fats in my diet. actually I would rate this fat free junk cookbook as what it is--pure junk with a rating of zero, or maybe a minus zero."
2,Controller Analysis,"This product is functional for the most part, the turbo has not been fully tested with all buttons, it's ok but hard to work with. I ordered it for the cheaper price and it is less durable. From a new controller the analog sticks rotate freely, although they work, it's hard to play games like this, also either or both of the analog push-down functions will stick a lot. The D-Pad is not as precise when you try to hit a single button and not physically responsive."
1,Be aware of Amazon's 3rd party vendor policy!!!,"Be aware of 3rd party vendor's policy!!! The reason I ordered this item is because it was less expensive then buying another S controller I was ordering from Amazon, $14.72 versus $24.99. The savings however was gone after receiving my confirmation e-mail showing I was paying $7.98 to ship controller! This was not shown anywhere before placing my order! Amazon shipped two other items for under $6.00, maybe they need to check their 3rd party vendor's shipping rates before selling their products. You also can't cancel orders with 3rd party vendors!!! I would need to jump thru hoops to maybe get it canceled. (Amazon's policy!!!) In the end Amazon lost a sale and if this continues they will lose customers."
2,RUBBISH,tis is the most largest and rubbish controller of all time its worse tan the oringale so i returned it cause it was so bad so i brought the logitech wireless controller instead and tats the best its small lightwieght well placed same as the other logitech controller (precision) BUT WIRELESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Good quality paper,My 8 year old daughter really enjoys this watercolor pad along with the watercolor pencils that I ordered with it. It is a very good quality product.
5,Great Bag,"I've used the bag twice and it is very good. It is much lighter than a roller bag. That is great for people who want to stick with a carry on when the weight limit is low. It is comfortable as a backpack, not as comfortable as my Osprey Ariel but I don't use this for backpacking. There is plenty of room for a 2 week trip as long as you pack light and plan to either do or pay for a little laundry along the way. My rule is if I don't wear it twice I don't take it. I found only one negative to the bag. When lifting the bag into the overhead bin on an airplane, it takes significantly more strength to get it up there than a standard 22 inch rollaboard. I think the reason is that it has no stiff structure and so it deflects in all directions. If I come up with a solution for this I will post it later."
3,Great for the price,"Camera included is an odd shape and can't be tilted to desirable angles. I suggest adding a different style of compatible camera. I had some older adjustable cameras that are much better for my application.It is just set up in a closed window. I use it for surveillance during the day. I can see who is at my door or in my driveway. Night vision is useless through a window to see outside, but may work well indoors."
3,Easy to lose pieces,"The flip action of this tool is great (I replaced an old ACE hardware unit with this) - it works well.BUT - when using a tool like this with my cordless drill, I like to have all the pieces together. With this unit, all the pieces come in a separate box, and there are a ton of them. The allen wrench to tighten the bits is loose (could have been integral in the unit). There are many drill bits but they are not attached to the bit holding pieces (also many of these). I like to have all the drill bits and driver bits for my flip tool in the drill box. So far I've lost the flip tool box 3 times and am tired of tracking it down."
2,NOT A VERY ABSORBING BOOK,"I MUST ADMIT A DISAPPOINTMENT IN THIS BOOK--THE STORY LINE WAS FAIR, BUT I FEEL AS IF WHITNEY WAS GRASPING, SO TO M SPEAK, AND THE WRITING STYLE LEFT ME COLD. AFTER HAVING READ SEVERAL OTHER WHITNEY WORKS, IT SEEMED TO ME THAT SHE WAS HAVING AN ""OFF TIME"" DURING THE WRITING OF THIS BOOK."
2,Pastoral Dreaming,"I found this book to offer little in the way of actual knowledge. It is very full of positive excitement 'yay living in harmony with the earth' type stuff, but nothing useful. It hints at ideas that one has to research further in order to implement. This is in no way an instructional book. Save your money and get it from the library if you are still curious."
1,Don't waste your money,"I picked one up last year, and it broke on it's first use. Unbelievable that it uses hard plastic parts in it's clamping. They won't last five minutes."
1,Complete junk,"Very flimsy, holes drilled in the wrong places, and most of the sheet metal is bent. Just total junk. Even the holes in the top aren't drilled all the way through. Don't waste your money."
1,FOREIGN MADE AND SHOWS IT!,"It's a terrible shame that a company with a good name attaches it to such a shoddy product.Unfinished holes,mismachined parts, etc.The only reason I didn't return the product, it wouldn't have been worth the hassle.One day I just may take and spend a couple more hours to make it useable.Or just throw it into the trash.Black and Decker WM125 Workmate 125 350 Pound Capacity Portable Work Bench"
4,so far so good,"Per husband, was easy to assemble. Took him about 30 min. Seems very sturdy. Haven't used it yet..."
4,RTFM Issues,Advice on this and any assembly requirements on any product: READ the manual once through then go back and assemble it. Mine went together just fine. If your holes for the bottom braces didn't line up then you tried to put them on the wrong side. The pins for the vice knobs are supposed to be tight fitting. Mine went in with some coaxing and a small tack hammer. You're not going to overhaul an engine on this thing. It is just an extra set of hands that works quite well for small tasks. I'm happy with mine.
4,Entertaining and light-hearted read,"As a new mother who sometimes needs a break from reading educational books on raising babies and children, I found this book entertaining and funny. Mothers can love their children but have a sense of humor at the same time. I think people are too quick to judge other mothers, especially those who experience postpartum depression and/or have trouble completely embracing motherhood from day one. If you are easy-going and just want a fun read, this is a good book."
2,Why did the original work so well while this one burns?,See above. Aren't you glad I didn't do a video? pjur original works very well. The variations of gels and whatever seem to irritate the heck out of the object of her affection.
3,Good looking but not the most reliable,"Good-looking, but not of the best reliability.i'm using this model for two years but wait it every second to brake down.- Hands of clock dangle- One of the screws fixing watch bracelet lost- Unsonvenient set time and date mechanism- Crack on the glass in the left-down corner. Though, to my surprise, it didn't affect water-proof capabilities.Thoung i must mention that i use this watches in harsh conditios - i wear it all the time.And they still ticking!"
4,Northern Crown - a solid setting,"I was generally pleased with Northern Crown. The production values are top-notch, and the campaign seems to have more thought behind it than most. I don't think the 17 cultures (think races) was excessive, as it fits well with the setting. I liked the way each culture was given classes that were most appropriate to it, and the explanations for how that class fit into the culture. The classes looked generally well designed, at least by d20 standards. I thought the fencing rules were well thought out and easily implemented. But, really, its the attention to background detail that makes this book worth it. A great deal of time and effort went into the setting, and I think it will be a joy to play."
2,How can you call this a map of Cape Cod?,"The description does not state that there are only a few towns on the map. I need a map of Falmouth and it's not even on this map! It just has the middle part of Cape Cod, which is really stupid because you have to drive through the lower cape to get there!"
3,Incomplete map,"It is not at all clear from the title of this map that it includes only the central portion of the Cape. No Bourne, Sandwich, Falmouth, Truro, Wellfleet, Provincetown, or Hyannis. The list of towns is included in the image on the cover; good luck reading it."
5,Another great Gordon Haskell album,I am very much a Gordon Haskell fan. I don't think he is capable of making a bad album. I thoroughly enjoy his voice and every song he has written appeals to me. He is a fine artist and deserves more recognition. Listen to him and agree.
1,How I Wish You Didn't,"Many years ago I read What I'm Going To Do, I Think.I remember thinking at the time: "" What a wonderful writer. What a depressing book."" Mr. Woiwode's current effort, which I read after reading a glowing review, seemed like words strung together and thrown at the page in order to meet a deadline and/or pay bills. It was reminiscent of the old saw about Oakland. I kept wondering why such an intelligent guy would place himself and his family in harms way in such a godforsaken climate when a person of such obvious talent and connections has almost any location in the world available to him as a place to live. I couldn't keep from wondering if the son's shooting accident was really an accident. If anybody wants this book, I'd be glad to give you mine."
4,Great book!,This review contains spoilers!I have all three in the series and i just loved the book. The heroine meets the hero and is shocked at how much he resembles her 'dead' lost love. She is sure that this man is her lost love but he denys it. He doesn't remember who he is or anything about himself. He believes that she only cares about him because he reminds her of her lost love. She actually falls in love with the man he is now but he doesn't believe her love is true. The only complaint I have about this book is that it isn't confirmed until the very end that he is indeed who every one believes him to be.
3,Great flyer!,"Great flyer, but can be destroyed quickly by an agressive dog. I use it on my cattle dog who won't shake it, but not on my blue heeler who chews and shakes and tries to kill the Jolly Pet."
5,A Lost Book of the Bible,This is a great companion to the book of Moses and to the Bible as well. An enlightening book!
2,no activity,"well I WANTED to like this blog; I liked the blurb. but there's been no activity at all, for most of my trial period??"
2,Needs improvements,"The unit is very basic. I only needed a basic gps so i purchased it. The price was really good. I was very disappointed when I used it. I took it to a trip and did it let me down. The initial directions were ridiculous. It took me of the highway and put me back on the highway several times. Then, when i reached the hotel, I took the directions for a mall (which has been there for 10 years)... The unit was off by 5 miles. It said you have arrived to your destination but I was pretty far away from my destination. The nice people at a gas station helped me get to the mall. On my way back, the gps just died. I checked the battery and it was dead. Th battery lasted less than 2 hours. I was extremely dissatisfied with the unit. Thanks to amazon.com's awesome return policy, I returned it."
1,ViaMichelin is going out of GPS business,"ViaMichelin is going out of GPS business. You will be buying a unit that will be discontinued and presumably neither supported or updated. See below: ViaMichelin, the subsidiary of the French tyre manufacturer specialising in digital travel assistance products, has stated it will no longer participate in the GPS navigation device market. According to a report published in France's La Tribune, the company, which holds 14 per cent of the French GPS market, has found it difficult to expand in Europe in the face of strong competition from rivals such as TomTom. Sixty of ViaMichelin's 170 employees are affected by the decision, La Tribune reported."
3,ViaMichelin X-930 Portable Navigation GPS,"Good product for a small price.Handy and easy to use. But sometime, a little bit slow to connect and to get the satellites."
3,good product for the price,"pros:1) cheap, thin and lightweight2) detailed map on 1Gig card3) USA and Canada map included4) good POIs. grocery stores, hotels, restaurants etc. It even showed disney world when I was in Florida.5) voice prompt6) select on map. You can select a destination on a map. But I could not find ""daytona beach""cons:1) Difficult interface to master. All the menus are not visible. For example, to create a route, you have to click on settings, navigate to, my saved addresses and then create.2) Sometimes it gets stuck on a map. For example, after coming from Florida, I selected a route, but it got stuck in Florida map3) Not sharp graphics.4) I think it forgets some settings when you turn it off and then on."
2,Others might be better,I purchased the X930 for my wife. The con they list is probably the most important fact they can mention. It is difficult to the point of impossible (occasionally) to input and find locations. It would appear from the product's website that they have discontinued the product and even the website is somewhat difficult to get around. My friend has a Garmin and I recommend their product over this one with no reservations. I am unimpressed with the lacking userfriendliness of this product and do not recommend it's purchase despite it's low price tag.
1,NO PARTS? BAD SUPPORT!!,"I lost one part and now I can't use the base. They don't sell parts . The lesson: Go with a known company.Other problems: Low battery life, not easy to use.AVOID!!!I called customer service and they said (We don't sell parts), unacceptable! How can they sell this thing in the US without selling parts?Maybe Amazon should not sell it...."
2,Not something that'd save me when really needed,"Bought it for emergency situations when I would really need it but from just testing it locally, the stupid thing doesnt find a satellite until I was 5 mins from home. Dont think it'd come in handy when I really need it which is the situation I bought it for. Sorry, not a good review, may work for others, not for me!"
1,Works when it wants...,"Bought due to the price, it was a mistake :- Viamichelin has left the gps market now. So no more support, no more update on maps. In 2 years, your acquisition will be obsolete.- horrible long time to get the gps signal acquisition. Sometimes 15 minutes to get back the signal (and the information !) after going through tunnels... Unacceptable.- horrible bugs, needs to be often reseted.I have sold it and bought a Tomtom..."
2,Not woth it...,"Even though this the first GPS i tried/bought, i did not like the features much. After buying i saw other ones in the store and found out that if i had spend $100 more i would have got a much better one than this 'good looking not so useful gadget'. Would'nt recommend anyone to buy it."
3,This GPS wasn't that helpful!!,"This GPS wasn't that helpful compared to a Garmin, which shows the street names and says it as well. When I bought this GPS I wasn't sure if this was worth buying. I don't use this GPS anymore since I use a Garmin now. Thanks Amazon."
1,"Not been supported for 4 years, why would you buy it?",I don't know why this is still being sold. ViaMichelin stopped supporting it in 2008 so you can't get map updates any longer i.e. it will give you incorrect directions.
4,ViaMichelin X-930,"Good device, accurate, finding satellite very fast, few things can be useful first ability to save route, second make route with via points, third if you press main menu button during navigation cannot return back (I did not find way to do that)."
1,Hopeless,"I'm pretty pissed with this gps. I did buy this in 2006, and it was amazing then, but now everything is outdated. Nothing is right, it doesn't even have my house...seriously piece of junk. No updates ever, I'm going to have to hack it to get tomtom or something on it, worthless. DONT BUY!"
1,trash,"I bought this unit and thankfully found out that it belonged in the trash before the return period had expired. It did not accurately pick up my position anywhere, and also had problems picking up signals. I actually punched in Miami and the unit came back with ""address not found"" several times. Trash. I would not recommend it to anyone"
2,Not at all user friendly,I bought this for my husband for a birthday present and it is not at all user friendly. I would not recommend this at all.
5,Sturdy and Stable,"I bought this step for exercise after knee replacement. Is perfect for this purpose because it can be set for two heights, both lower than a normal step. You can progress as your knee heals and allows more flexibility. I looked at a lot of steps and this one was definately the most economical one and it is very sturdy. I even use it to more safely get on my exercise bike, which was hard to get on because of having to set the seat so high. Anyone who has had a knee replacement would understand the importance of making all exercise easier and safe and sturdy. It has lots of uses, even ease in stepping over the edge of a bathtub, also a problem for a knee replacement."
2,ride away on horses review,i bought this for my 1 year old granchildren- they music is a little unfamiliar and hard to catagorize- they did not take to it right away.
5,Microsoft Streets & Trips 2008,"I have been purchasing the program for the past three years and have seen continuous improvement in it. I mainly use it for navigation using GPS with my laptop. The 2008 version has added some nice features among the best is the automatic recalculate feature when you vary from the route set up by the progrram.As with any program, there are a few glitches regarding street accessability, names etc. Thses have been referred to Microsoft for correction.All in all, it is a great program."
1,Maps,"Really disappointed in this software. I moved into a new home development two years ago and it is still not contained in the 2008 version of Microsoft Maps. To bad......I really like the original software, but don't bother to spent the money to upgrade"
3,Stick with the 2007 version,"Unless you really need the updated maps, I would not upgrade from Streets and Trips 2007.* The 2008 version is the first one with a product key that needs to be registered. I assume this means I can no longer sell or give away the old version when I buy the new one. So I won't be upgrading every year anymore.* After I did the install, it corrupted a dll that Money 2007 uses. I had to reinstall Money to get it working again."
3,Streets & Trips loses feature adds other,"I notice when I was using my favorite trip mapping program it lost a feature that I use when it does not give me a route to an area and I wish to avoid an area for some reason or another. They have eliminate the avoid area function or select area function by boxing an area and use the point to move the map, instead of selecting. They have added Live Maps; Live Search using internet, I am not always using or accessing the web for this to function properly. Otherwise this is a good program to find addresses to an unfamiliar city or area. Some limitations to some businesses in cities, but if you have address it gets you there fairly quickly and shortest possible route or time if perferences are set in option menu."
3,Microsoft Streets and Trips 2008,"It was not worth the money for the update from 2007. The street that I live on has been paved for 4+ years and it still does not show up on MS Streets & Trips. The new ""view"" is fairly useless. It does do what I need it to do and I use it daily. It could have been better I think. MS should offer an upgrade price. Perhaps next year..."
4,Well done with GPS system,I purchased the version with the GPS and am very happy with the product. There doesn't seem to be very many changes from the prior years version of this product but I was pleased with that program also. The GPS unit is second to none. It is very accurate and the sensitivity is quite good. It picks up signals quickly even while under cover. The driving guidance works well and gives just the right amount of time when giving verbal directions. Overall this is a good package.
3,"Still pretty lame, and now it has #%$^%& activation","I didn't think much of the 2007 version of Streets & Trips (see review). It had a lot of mapping errors and a disappointingly low number of POIs.Well, the 2008 version is basically more of the same. OK, some errors are now fixed, and they now claim 1.6 million POIs. Folks, this is still a LAME number. To even have a chance of claiming ""full"" coverage of the US requires a minimum of 5-6 million, which is what you will find in any real navigation system.So, while it will plot a course that will get you there, it won't even begin to show you all the places along the way.The final insult is that now it has the onerous Microsoft activation scheme added. I change computers more often than most people, so this is a real nuisance to me.So, I'm still waiting for something with a user interface like this, but with 4 or 5 times the POIs. I'm not holding my breath."
1,Activation is a problem,"I have several older versions of Streets ending in 2006, and the new activation scheme is a real killer for me. It is far easier to use Google (for free) and a Garmin (with custom poi addins). Save your money."
4,Awesome!,"This CD was really great and cheaply priced for such quality flute music! I agree that Bradley Garner isn't a Julius Baker, but he really complements Julius' exquisite tone. I suggest any person who loves great flute music either for entertainment or use should buy this CD, I mean really how could you refuse the price?!"
5,Black and Decker Navigator Handsaw,I purchased this saw about 6 months ago and cannot tell you how happy I have been with it. I recently had to purchase additional blades and couldn't find them anywhere except on Amazon. Thanks Amazon for being there when I need you.The service was excellent and the saw is too.
1,Worst song of the the past 10 years,"This song is just a horrible, awful, stupid mess from start to finish. The beat is annoying, the lyrics are stupid, and the rapping is abysmal and everything sucks here. This song is worse than most of the corny pop songs from the late 1990s. Much worse."
5,Two of Tchaikovsky's best,"These are two of Tchaikovsky's finest compositions. His Suite No. 3 is melodic throughout and is better than his early symphonies -- which I mean as a compliment to this delightful suite, not as a criticism of his early symphonies. Francesca da Rimini is a great tone poem which every Tchaikovsky lover should own. Tchaikovsky wrote so much great music that some outstanding works such as these have not received the full recognition which they deserve. Highly recommended."
3,VERY ENTERTAINING PROPAGANDA THAT POSES AS A DOCUMENTARY,"This documentary may come across as a valid presentation by having all kinds of ""experts"" from various religions and denominations, but anyone who has the basic knowledge on the history of how the Bible came to be would wonder why the ambiguity. And this dvd is LOADED with ambiguity. If you want the direct answer as to who wrote the Bible and how we got it, I strongly suggest you get the dvd Where Did The Bible Come From. It will make some people uncomfortable and others rejoice. I only suggest you get this dvd if you're wise enough to know you're being lied to, but merely wish to be entertained."
3,PPTP VPN dial-in not supported,"If you have an office with remote users (connecting from home, the road, hotel) then this it not the right product for you.The very important feature that is missing in the RV082 is lack of support for remote clients dialing in using the Windows-built-in PPTP VPN adaptor.Because Linksys missed on that one, you have to install VPN client software for every remote computer. and getting your hands on that software is not easy and it costs you extra money and is not provided by Linksys.This is the major difference between this router and the Cisco PIX 501 that costs just a little more.True, PIX has 10 user max and only one WAN - but it this is more then enough for 99% of users.I would buy the PIX501 and have a full-feature firewall with no need to buy extra software."
1,Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen,"This felt like a bunch of friends got together for a weekend and, after borrowing an old video camera and downing a case of cheap beer, went out and made a horror movie for fun. The result was one of the most wretched things I've ever watched. The plot made little sense, the dialog was unnecessarily laden with F-bombs, the attempts at humor unfailingly fell flat, the acting was terrible, and most of the characters were outright repellent. There was absolutely nothing redeeming or recommendable here."
5,Perfect gift for any man,Desk Ref (like the Pocket Ref) makes a perfect gift for any man... provided you don't mind them reciting amazing facts for the next several days.
1,Not recommended for those who appreciate grammer and logical flow,"At the beginning of this review, I want to say that I identify as both queer and gender transgressive and typically have an outwardly feminine presentation. I bought this book hoping to read the stories of others who identify as queer femmes and be enlightened or inspired. Unfortunately, the awful grammar and absolute lack of capitalization or punctuation in some of the essays blocked many of the essays' ability to capture my heart or mind. Brazen Femme, with the exception of the excellent essay by Sky Gilbert, also failed to challenge the assumption that to be femme one needs to be born, or remain, biologically female."
5,Snenaniganx,"Truely European paced, it just gives us more time to view and enjoy the richness and beauty of the film.Love it."
2,Lost,I got lost. Then fell asleep. After awhile I woke up and then shut the durn thing off and went back to sleep.
4,One of my favorite French movies!,... And it was made even better by the fact that I didn't have to wait to get it in the mail! It came so quickly and in great condition. Thanks!
5,Comprehensive information in a single source,"This is a very useful book for anyone who is moving to Switzerland for the first time. I found in this publication many useful pieces of advice for the everyday living in Switzerland. Do not hesitate to buy this book if you plan to stay in Switzerland for a long time. Taxes, health insurance, renting a house, travelling, etc. are only a few examples of the subjects reviewed in this comprensive book. Sometimes the author employs a style that may be considered a bit irreverent, but I guess that he tried to write with a senseof humour.A good choice.Marcelo Garcia"
3,"Great book, one problem","The author has made almost no effort to describe the French speaking parts of Switzerland. Too Germanocentric and at times a little irreverent. Otherwise, all the official information, transport, employment etc... is well researched and well written."
5,Garage Door Opener Remote,"I purchased two garage door openers in 1992 from Home Hardware. One of the remotes quit working and the original store advised the product was discontinued and I needed to purchase a replacement for apx $50. Searching Amazon, I found this remote and it sounded just like the one I needed; so for $15 I took a chance.It's identical to the one I needed except for the name on the front and the new one is black compared to the one I had which is red - no problem!I set the new one's dip switches to the same configuration as the old one, pushed the button and voila! It works like a charm!The battery included was a bonus as they are expensive to buy separately.I'm a happy camper!"
2,Not up to the past,"Ever since this product was franchised to the USA, its production quality has been weakened. It is a much more watered down product. Nowadays, its more Brooklyn than Bermuda. Caveat Emptor!"
3,Average,It covers most of the major themes dealing with loss. It reads a bit slow and some parts are not interesting. Rebuilding is significantly better book.
3,cute songs,I bought this CD mostly because it had songs that would teach numbers. The songs do sound fairly similar but what disappointed me the most was all the number songs had the exact same tune. :( Makes it hard for kids to know right off which frame of mind they need to be in to sing each song.
5,Great for travel or at home.,I have used Prell for years and years. The concentrate fits in the suitcase better than the big bottle and it last a long time because it only takes a little drop to lather up. Good stuff.
5,Two great American Symphonies,"A wholly sensible coupling: 2 of the 3 great American Third Symphonies (the third one being William Schuman's)in excellent performances, vividly recorded. Jarvi may not quite command Bernstein's spontaneity and sheer muscle power, but he knows how these works should go and the Detroiters back him up to the hilt. He does have an advantage over Bernstein in the Harris: the work is here performed complete (most earlier recordings make two cuts, both sancioned by the composer).This is music which harks back to an earlier, more innocent and idealistic America. And especially on that level, it makes for very affecting, stirring listening."
4,Picked right up where Retrospect left off,"I've spent little time on this so don't have a detailed review. Suffice it to say it's fast on a cloning (""Simple Copy"") whichit updates incrementally nice and fast too. Unlike Apple's Backup program, your data doesn't have to be in the Home Folder.Saving and naming your routine requires attention to the panel but when you see where and how it's named at the bottom of a list of their pre-programmed routines, its clear. I haven't tried it oniDisk but assume it works onto the internet.I'd give 5 stars if there were a Save Routine command evident."
2,Not so fantastic,I was very disappointed when i got this book(let).The most detailed (and maybe the most erotic) art in this book is the one you see on the front cover.Most drawings (of total 26) wouldnt be worth printing if they werent a part of the collection.Nice book design but very poor content.
3,"not a bad start, but not enough to finish",Good at teaching you the differences between win32 and wince programming and starting you off with everything. Not enough information and not specific enough for Palm PC programming. More geared at initiating different aspects of wince programming rather than a reference.
4,"Good read, so-so condition","Dorothy Gillman's books are always a good read - especially good for traveling since they are light, engaging, and good to pass around when you're done. I bought a ""used"" book. All the pages were there, but it must have been read by at least 25 people - a bit tattered. Still, it was worth the price & I could read it all."
1,Complete Fraud,"I purchased 3ds Max for 3,500 and spent a further 3,000 to upgrade it. I now find that if I wish to upgrade the product yet again to version 4. Discreet will not let you do it - unless you pay another 1,500.Discreet are total rip off merchants. Steer clear of them. I have never had any support. I have never had any news about upgrades. Just pay out, payout.I can understand why so many people in London buy the 10 fully cracked version of Max version 7. The company does not deserve respect.My license number is: 640-00784104.Speak out tell it how it is. We the public try to be decent and buy legitimate software and get no support whatsoever, just endless upgrades to make money out of us. I flushed over 7,000 - $10,000 down the crapper with this company. - - Avoid them."
1,Answer book for the first Hebrew primer,Would write a review as soon as I receive the book! Ordered it on apr 17 and still don't have it???? Estimated delivery date was supposed to be may 10!!!!! Would someone be more concerned about my PURCHASED book than a review?
4,Son loves these,"My son (20 months) is very technical, he likes to take things apart and put back together, loves tools, loves puzzles so I got these as a stocking stuffer. He is able to work them and seems to enjoy them very much. Only issue is that we have had for 2 months and the ball on the end of the bolt is getting a little rough, no splinters but just rough. Considering applying polyurethane to the ends or the rubberized stuff you dip tools in."
1,disappointed with defective item,"I received this watch fairly quickly with priority USPS shipping. It came in a flimsy padded envelope, without the usual Skagen watch box. When I opened it, the watch had obvious defects in the strap (the leather was wrinkled and discolored). It was advertised as a new in the box product, not used or defective. I have requested a return authorization # as per their instructions, and because it was not my fault, I asked for a UPS prepaid label to return it to them. Also, I now notice that the company only offers replacements, if it is defective. That's not fair. So far, no response from customer service, though. I probably will never order from them and tell my friends and family not to either...."
2,Not What I Ordered,"I ordered the WearEver PREMIUM Hard-Anodized pan based upon good reviews. However, I received a lower grade WearEver, not the premium. Vendor said they do not sell the premium - it was Amazon's error. They did process a return in fairly good time without a hassle."
5,Great value! My favorite skillet!,"Wearever Admiration Hard-Anodized 12-Inch Saute PanMy all time favorite skillets for cooking! Nothing sticks! Cleanup is a breeze! Totally even cooking surface! These are the ones I reach for for eggs, crepes, hollandaise sauces and other foods that routinely stick in other pans and are subject to heat fluctuations in other pans. Simply love this cooking product line and you will too! Highly recommend! K. Wheeling"
3,I liked the book!,"Sure, it wasn't as wild as her first book, ""I'm With The Band: Confessions of a Groupie"", but she's starting to grow up! I guess it has to happen! I still enjoyed the book. There's a lot of growth here as a person. She's determined not to be a doormat and starts confronting issues head-on. Like her not so perfect marriage, her father's death, and past relationships. I love her description of Jimmy Page, how she started to see him in an entirely different way. IMO, he was a hypocrite to call her a ""bimbo"" and trash her book. Pamela is an excellent writer, even if the subject matter isn't quite as tittilating as her first book."
3,Downgrade!,"I had three pairs of Warmbats (2 Kangaroo Classic short and 1 Gecko Grip short) that I ordered back around December 2005. They were wonderful! So comfortable and snug. Felt like walking around in marshmallows! I had a pair of Ugg boots for one day. Send them back the very next day because they weren't nearly as comfy as my Warmbats. I decided to order another pair of Warmbat kangaroo classics this winter. When I got them, they felt different, flimsy. The wool in my previous pairs is much, much thicker and curlier providing a much snugger fit. The wool in the pair I recently received is thin and almost straight. I replaced the removable insole with an Ugg replacement insole and they're MUCH more comfy (which kinda makes me want to give Ugg boots another try). Still not as perfect as my older Warmbats though. I'm giving Warmbat three stars for the way they USED TO fit."
3,A solid album with some interesting songs on it.,"""Mind Control"" by Stephen Marley is a pretty good album, although I wouldn't say that it is great. I loved Damian Marley's ""Welcome to Jamrock"" so I was hoping somewhere in the back of my mind that this album would be as good as that one. The main point against ""Mind Control"", is that there is not a coherent vision throughout. It seems like Stephen Marley was trying a lot of different things, which is nice in some ways, but the album never reaches the cohesive or well crafted potential that it has. That said it is nice to have some songs that are more concious as well as some that are more dance-hall. I particlualrily liked the somewhat quiet song ""You're Gonna Leave"" and the more dance-hallish song ""Lat Her Dance."""
3,It's ok,"This album have some good music, but it's not what I was waiting for. If you are looking for all-reggae cd, this is not it, but if you want to enjoy good music including few reggae songs, then you shoud grab this one. Still hoping one day, they'll (Ziggy Marley & the Melody Makers) start making music like they used to and return to be once again one of the best reggae band."
4,He may have held back,"It is unfair to compare any artist to Bob Marley, but, unfortunately for Steven, his voice, lyrics, and even occasionally his beats call out for one. One of the things that makes Bob Marley so great is the intense amount of emotion you can hear in his music. Of course, this is not present on all songs, but even some laid back ones, Redemption Song for example, are very, very emotional. Steven both has such emotion and the ability to express artistically. In this album, however, I only 'felt it' on one track: Iron Bars. Besides that, it almost seemed like Steven held back at times. Most of the other songs are good, but not as great as I think he could make them. Having said all that, this is a great first album (albeit from a music veteran) and he had me jammin along for most of the tracks.'If a egg, natty inna di red.'"
5,Mind Control,very innovative CD with thought provoking compositions. Stephen put his heart into this CD. a good additional to your music collection.
1,sticky keys hard to press & bug with shift key,"after a while, of owning the keyboard, the keys stick and you have to press certain keys at the correct angle in order for them to go down. be prepared to use a little bit of force on shift key, and hit the space bar at the correct angle without pressure.second problem, in the ie web browser, the right shift button on my keyboard gets reprogrammed on its own to behave like the back button. to solve that, unplug the keyboard for a week or two to make sure the memory is gone and the shift button will work as a shift button normally in ie. notice, i am not typing with any capital letters. that is because if i do use shift, i will go back to prior page of writing this review. funny huh."
5,Awsomely funny!,I am a 4th grade teacher and have a child in my room that is not a recreational reader. He had to do a book report and this book just arrived in our school's library. I picked it up and quickly skimmed the cover. It seemed interesting so I recommended it to William. I recieved a letter from his mother two days later which said she was so happy to see him READING and not wanting to put this book down. Several times she had to check on him because he was either so quiet or laughing OUT LOUD! I could not give a better recommendation than that.
2,Why philosophers get a bad name,"This is simply a work of esoteric mysticism masquerading as rigorous thought. Let me ask you something, if there is a written work and 90 people read it and each one gets an almost totally different interpretation of it, does it mean that the writer is a genius that we are all just too simple-minded to understand, or is it more likely that he wrote in an extremely esoteric and cryptic way and he is the one who is not making any sense? This is Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit. Complete garbage. Don't let the ivory tower academics fool you, you will gain nothing from reading this book except scratching your head at how to interpret sentences like, ""the absolute spirit recognizes itself in the world and then returns to itself"". Hegel is a joke. Read Ancient, Medieval, 20th century philosophy, but just stay away from the German Idealists, they are the epitome of ivory tower thinkers."
3,Continental Philosophy,"Have you ever met anyone who dresses in black, smokes Brazilian cigarettes and espouses that Hegel is ""best read in the original German?"" Well, neither have I, but I do know that after reading a little bit of Kierkegaard I wanted to know what all the fuss was about, why he despised Hegel so. After reading four pages of this book, I realized that it was not his philosophy that was so abhorrant (although the development of many of his ideas seems to have laid the groundwork for every bad 20th century political movement), but his writing style. It is wretched enough to throw anyone into deep existential crisis."
2,CD Bugs!,"Although the material has been helpful, I'm very dissatisfied with the CD ROM and the bugs it has. Only after taking the 3rd and final test did I realize that there were obvious wrong answers and that the clock was NOT ACCURATE! After months of preparation I go into the test with scores as high as 680, although the time limits have never been accurate. This is very misleading and I feel unprepared. I'd like my money back."
2,Not quite full size,"This toy money is not full size, it's about two-thirds or so. Good for small children's hands, but not full sized. Unfortunately, when I read 'ultra realistic', I assumed full sized bills. I was wrong. Other than that, seems good quality."
3,smaller than expected,"I bought these to be part of a gift (put them inside of an aluminum attache case that was a gift for a friend so that it seemed more like a spy briefcase) and thought that with the number of bills it said came in the pack it would fill up the case pretty nicely. I didn't expect them to be realistic, but they were just really tiny and very thin paper so it didn't have quite the effect I was going for. Oh well. As a toy I'm sure they're fine."
4,The Beach is just not the Beach....,until you get yourself a set of these paddles to play with. This product met/exceeded all expectations and are of the highest quality. They have made it through several international airports without a scratch...and will be something we use for years to come.
1,Mystery date game,Just be careful when buying vintage games online. The newer ones look old but are not vintage. This particular game was listed as vintage but was not. It also came with a vintage price...
1,Think twice before buying this text!,"Astoundingly bad text. To say that this book is dry is a complement. The fact is that any introduction text should paraphrase and explain the more complicated issues involved. The authors do not do this. They borrow from the GASB standards word for word in order to fill out space in the text. See what you think of the following excerpt: ""Accordingly, a distinctive characteristic of governmental accounting resulting from the need to demonstrate compliance with laws governing the sources of revenues available to governmental units and laws governing the utilization of those revenues is the formal reporting of the legally approved budget compared with actual results for the General Fund and all special revenue funds that have a legally adopted annual budget."" Real nice for an intro book!"
2,Poor text!!! Not very clear at all.,"I am still in the process of using this book. I am not seeing supporting information for the tables and charts used. To answer the questions in the back of the chapter, I am having to figure out on my own what goes where and drawing from other resources rather than the chapter as it doesn't explain very well. This is my 8th accounting class and this is the worst text I have used thus far. It is definitely NOT worth the cost."
2,Pretty Much Useless...,"This book is not helpful in any way, shape, or form. The authors do not emphasize key points - you will have to scour entire paragraphs to find a topic which would be bulleted/bolded in any normal textbook.The examples are absolutely useless. I don't know if there is a better book out there, but avoid this one if you can."
3,"Great Reference, lousy text","This is NOT a good textbook for someone learning accounting, however, this will be an excellent reference guide once I have learned the governmental accounting.This text provides a significant number of journal type transaction entries any brief explanation of general areas of government accounting.It lacks start to finish examples of how to complete many of the reporting and requirements for governmental accounting.If I had it to do over again I would keep this text is a reference and not a textbook."
4,Definitive Guide for Beginners to ISA,"I was totally new to ISA and came to know about this book from the ISAServer forum.It not only gives in-sight into the inner workings of the product but also speaks about the philosophy and history behind the creation of this versatile tool.Understanding, Installing and Configuring ISA is just a piece of cake with this book"
2,"Please, beware with this album!","It was just the last Saturday when I decided to listen this so well commented album; but I must confess the disillusion was pitifully over my hopes. Horowitz played a percussive Scarlatti overshadowing the nave expression and the angelical mood immersed in these miniatures, on the other hand the excess of staccatos and the thundering fingering definitively wrecked any possibility of incorporeal lyricism.A true shame! Recommended only for the hard fans of Vlada."
1,"If it's PerlShop you're after, forget it!","Anyone who buys this book because he wants to install the PerlShop electronic shopping cart system is probably going to be disappointed. Not so much with Weil and Baron's book, but with PerlShop itself. I have spent an immense amount of time trying to get PerlShop up and running, but to no avail. In checking around, my experience seems to be nearly universal, especially for those who want it to run on a secure server. Only the hard-core, industrial strength Perl mavens seem to be able to get it to work securely, like it is supposed to. If you want a shopping cart for your Web site, take a look at CGI FOR COMMERCE by Birznieks and Selena Sol. END"
1,a waste of paper,I already reviewed this book and spent time on my review. You only have the author and publisher's reviews and maybe one from their mothers! Why do you not include negative reviews?? You lose a great deal of credibility by only including the author's bubbling over his work. These boys wrote this worthless drivel in a rushed afternoon and it shows! Have the guts to print less that gushing reviews!!
2,Dissapointing for those who want to learn anything...,"I purchased the book for a CGI class I had taken - the code that it includes does definitely work, and the book is well written. However, if you want to learn anything about actually writing CGI code, this will not help at all. It includes multiple scrips that you can modify, and teaches how to modify, but doesn't say anything on how it works or how to re-create any of the processes in the scripts. For those who don't know how to write CGI, and don't want to learn, this is great...but for those who want to learn how to create the code, this book's not for you."
3,Very fast and flexible perl(web)Shop application included,"When you know Html quite well, have some experience with Perl (..is there other web scripting that's got the same 'write once, run everywhere..') this script offers everything for web-shops. It's fast and flexible. You can configure it anyway you want....BTW Implementing secure webshops is NOT 'the starting point for newbies' ... I think."
1,Do NOT buy this coffee maker,"This coffee maker has a serious design flaw which causes it to make a mess when brewing 2 cups at once. The problem occurs because one cup fills up more than the other cup, causing it to overflow coffee all over the appliance and the counter. Trust me..it was a mess. At first I thought it was because the counter was uneven, so I got out the level and tried it again (with just water) on a table that was absolutely level. I tried running 5 brews, 3 of the 5 overflowed 1 of the cups. The other 2 times, one of the cups was filled to the absolute brim so I couldnt get the top on. The other cup was about 2/3rds filled.Again...do NOT buy this item. Im sure you can find something similar that works."
3,"The cable is generic, and the quality is not equal to the original Nintendo cords.","In my opinion this should say generic, the cable works but is not the same QA.But it was nice...I cuold ran the GameCube without problem, I just think I will have to be carefully with this cable."
5,Unearthly experience,You need to just buy this CD right now. Go home and lock yourself away in the basement and meditate to this for a week or so. Totally impressive.
3,Greeting growls,"3 1/2Still one of only a handful of death metal-inflected releases I can admire, if anything for the fascinating acoustic balladry which made for such inspired transitioning in a field still needing so much. Though in the end one can feel the strain in its epic approach, SL still packs life."
1,"Bad bottle design, isn't working","First off, it's as if the makers designed this bottle to waste as many drops as possible. With the pricethey're charging, that's a major problem. Every time I shake it (with the top on) drops STILL come out the top and dribble down the bottle. I wonder how much $ I just wasted. When I try to put the drops in my dogs eyes, more drops come out and dribble down the bottle or squirt on to their faces. No, I'm not squeezing hard or anything, I'm just holding the bottle upside down. I was using Petvision, which has a good bottle that measure out a drop at a time. My dog was starting to see things (she had gone completely blind). We were both excited! Thinking Ocluvet must be better because it had studies backing it, and was more expensive, I switched. In just three days she's back to bumping into everything and walking around with that dazed look. Not a good trade for either of us."
5,it is an amazing product.,It is working beautifully in my dog.Her eyes are already clearing with just 4 weeks of application I strongly recommend it.
1,Didn't work for my dog.,"I guess I'm just one of those people that ""salesman"" feed on. My dog has cataracts and went completely blind within a few weeks time. It's made him really depressed and other than that, he's a healthy, elder dog. I don't know how I found this product, but it stated that it has remarkable results for dogs that have cataracts. I used the whole bottle, as directed, (oh, and by the way, the bottle leaks like crazy) and my dog is still blind as a bat. This product may work, but not for my dog. My review is if you have to spend money on drops, you can find them cheaper than $100 and they are the same, exact thing."
3,Hmmm...,"It is kind of hard to say which parts of THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY are fact or fiction. There isn't anybody but Cpl. Ryan himself to verify if this story is the 100% authentic link sausage. Still, it's an action packed page-turner that you could probably read in a day. Pretty good to read on a short plane trip."
4,Inspiring but questionable,"I just finished reading Chris' book and I have seen Andy's movie (although I didn't read his book). There is some conflicting information between the two accounts. I believe the source of the conflict is ego. Chris admits that Andy was the commander of the patrol, but then writes as if he (Chris) was the patrol's real leader. It appeared to me that Chris was trying to overstate his role, therefore I found Andy's account more believable, even though Andy tended to portray Chris as a whiner. However, they are all top rate soldiers and are to be commended for their work. Additionally, the book is very gripping and a good read. Its just questionable how accurate the information is. There are only 8 people who know for sure and only 5 are still with us. Thus, if you are looking for inspiration, buy it. If you're looking for historical accuracy, you might want to think twice."
1,Seemed really stupid to me...,"Take this advice from a kid- This book stinks. The whole thing is just... stupid. I didn't like the constant third-person complaining. To be honest, a lot of people have it worse than just having their parents in jail!"
2,Curl up with this....and fall asleep....,"After reading Ms.Rice's ""Cloud Nine"" and ""Blue Moon"", I was disappointed in this novel. I found the characters uninteresting and the plot slow and boring."
3,A different romantic novel,"A romantic novel, yes, but more than your typical boy meets girl and fall in love. Rice shows how the loss of a loved one through death can have far-reaching effects on future relationships.Getting past the guilt, the anger, the loneliness and all the other emotions that one feels when such a loss occurs and moving on with your life is the main premise of Rice's book. The fact that everyone at sometime has experienced the loss of a loved one gives Rice's story a universal appeal."
4,Strictly for Reference,"If you're looking for a book to curl up with for an evenings entertainment, continue looking. This book is strictly reference. If you want to know every recording ever of ""Showboat"", this is the place to look. As a collector of OBC's this book is invaluable, but I can see it's not for everyone."
3,Same cost as three years of netflix...,"And besides the 1933 Best Picture, I'm fairly certain you'd be able to find all of these movies available through Netflix. Plus even more films from Fox Studios are available from netflix (or your local rental store, etc...). Sure you can't just throw them in the ol' dvd player on a whim through netflix...but how many times are you going to sit and watch Independence Day when you have access to all these other great films as well? I realize I sound like an advert for the video rental industry, but it's true - there's very little reason to purchase this sharp looking set beyond the aesthetics.Also, why should you let Fox tell you what their best movies are? There's far too many wonderful narratives published by the studio, go out and make your own list of 75 instead. I'm sure if you're creative you'll save a little money, satisfy Fox Studios pocketbooks, and have a set specific to your own tastes."
3,Heroine I just couldn't like.,"Oh boy. I am sad to say that this story is a perfect example of a heroine that annoys the CRAP out of me. She's TOO stubborn, TOO rude, and got on my nerves on almost every page. I thought after 100 pages, she'd warm up to her man, but no. She fights him until the very last page. Don't get me wrong, there are some sweet moments, but I couldn't get the relationship between the two, one minute enemies, the next lovers. Many writers can make it work, she didn't, for me. This was my first Sandra Hill book, it won't be my last, but I'll only read one or two more before I can say I like or dislike her. Thank goodness for the humor, it carried me through."
3,Alright,"This book did have some funny parts to it. Although I really don't think it was all that good. The story seemed to just flow along taking too long. Hill probably could have managed to cut out 50 pages or better. It will keep your interest, it's not boring, but there are better time travels out there. I did lend my copy out but clearly stated that it was an ok read not horrible."
4,Courtship of the Vicar's Daughter,"This was a pleasant story, a continuation from a previous novel. It was a relaxing, good read. I recommend it."
3,Too predictable,I enjoyed the first book in this series but the plot was to predictable in the second book. Just okay.
5,The Courtship of the Vicar's Daughter,"I throughly enjoyed this book. It was the second in the series of ""The Gresham Chronicles"". The story of Victorian England, is beautiful and heart warming. I look forward to reading the rest of the series."
4,Quite Engaging,"Edmund Rubbra (1901-1986) is a composer who music is virtually unknown in this country. Conductor Richard Hickox should be familiar to many readers, however, by virtue of his recordings of Malcolm Arnold, or perhaps for his recordings of Ralph Vaughan Williams. There is some stylistic similarity between the music of Vaughan Williams and that of Rubbra, by the way, and those readers with an affinity for English orchestral music would do well to give this disk an audition. Both symphonies are quite engaging. A particular highlight for me is the second movement of the 6th, quietly radiant but not without undercurrents of tension. The Chandos sound is excellent."
5,There is a world out there...,"This is a fantastic book for fostering a child's interest in the world outside their own community. It doesn't matter that the topic is a trip around Australia - it could just as easily be any part of the world. The point is that this is a family of five that goes out and has an adventure together. In doing this, they are spending time together and discovering more about the country they live in.There is a lot of information about Australia in the story, taken from a kids-eye-level which engages preschoolers to primary age children.Young Billy's chant 'Are we there yet' is not a yearning for home, rather it's every child's boredom with the seemingly endless driving on a 10,000km+ road trip around a continent. All children can identify with this!This book is definitely a favourite in our house!"
5,To put this book down before finishing would be a crime,"This author kept me glued to the pages as does another of my favorites, John Sandford. It has mystery, suspense and romance. Eveything you want in a good thriller, you will find between these pages. It is impossible to put down."
5,Pelican perfection,"There are several choices on the market for foam-filled cases, and some are cheaper than the Pelican, but in my experience, none have been so consistently high in quality. The integrity of O-rings, the durability of the latches and the color choices all made the decision to buy this Pelican a simple one. My company owns about a dozen in various sizes, and they are just great.,"
1,A complete and Total Disaster,Doesn't heat consistently.Light went out and there is no way to access itTwo months old and completely shot.Stay far far FAR away from this unit.
1,Absurd plug-in cord,"I tried to connect my new Sharp microwave to an outlet that is 2 feet, 6 inches from my countertop.But the cord provided is only a little over 2 feet long!WHAT KIND OF AN IDIOT WOULD PROVIDE AN APPLIANCE WITH A PLUG-IN CORD LESS THAN 3 FEET LONG?This appliance is utterly useless to me. I will either have to return it or try to find an extension for it."
1,do not buy this!,"I made the mistake of buying this book, because Martin Gardner writes fantastic math books and because the title and location in he bookstore suggested this was a book on math ad science.Wrong.Aside from a few philosophical comments on quantum theory and the scientific method, this book is ramblings. The title claims it contains 'Other Mathematical and Pseudoscientific Topics' but in reality these acount for 2-3 out of five chapters. (One chapter is on the paranormal). The chapter on science contains one barely readable essay out of five.This is the worst disappointment I have read."
1,Misleading Description,This CD has five instrumental songs and not one sound of a babbling brook. I was very disappointed.
5,Inspirational,"For those who enjoy fine needlework and aspire to expertise, this book is inspirational. Excellent photos of embroidered treasures from throughout the world and throughout history with well-researched descriptions. Does not contain instruction, you will have to take a class for that.Beautiful enough for the coffee table in the living room."
1,Poor Quality,"This device broke into two the second time I used it. Concept is fine, and was easy to use, but device was very low quality."
3,The button helper,"This item would be great for someone who has a problemwith buttons, arthritic hands, etc. However, I had surgeryon my left hand and it was and still is a long recovery.I have one pair of slacks that have the button on the leftand I could use my right hand to hold the button gadjet.However, all the rest of my jeans/slacks have the button onthe right and I can't hold the gadjet in my left hand (becauseof the surgery) so for me, it wasn't helpful. However thiswas my fault and it is a good product. I'm sure if I hadn'thad surgery and just need a ""helper"", it would be 5 stars."
3,Good Grip Buttonhook,"The grip is as advertised-good. The wire insert that is critical to the device pulls out way too easily. I bought two of them and in one the wire came out right away. The other seems to be lasting. It does help but in a right handed world, the buttonholes are on the wrong side of the shirt. And the top button remains a real challenge- It can be done but it takes some real effort."
4,As Described,A gift for my 93 old Mother. She really likes it. Not sure what more I can say to make up the 20 required words.
3,does its job,"This product does exactly what it is supposed to do, nothing to say really. Nothing bad. My only real concern is that it's just citrus. I'm not positive on that, but it smells extremely citrus-y so I assume its some sort of highly concentrated citrus based chemical. If you are at all allergic to citrus(even if you aren't) I recommend using gloves."
5,Excellent,"The product itself is spectacular. It does its job very well, with relative ease. It was a great price when I bought it, and would likely pay twice as much for it. The retailer is great as well, product AS EXPECTED, shipped promptly, and had zero problems. Thanks!"
5,Excellent!,"Everything looks prefect! I use it for my laptop and its work very well. I ordered Arctic Silver 5 Thermal Compound, 3.5 Grams - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BSLU2S/ref=ox_ya_os_productI used those that's work great for your computer's processor or laptop's processor."
5,Great Cleaner and Purifier,"This is all I use on my builds. There is cheaper stuff that may work as well, but I haven't found a TIM that this can't remove yet. So I'll stick with it. I like the purifier because it evaporates fast and leaves the surface pristine for the TIM to fill in the microscopic voids in the heat spreader and heat/sync surface."
2,Pretty but not ready for thorns,"These gloves are very well-made and fit like a glove. BUT, they are definitely not thorn-proof. Even short sticker bush thorns penetrate easily. Why they are marketed as a rose glove is beyond me."
2,bionic women's rose gloves,"Turns out large is not large. And if they exchange it, you're stuck w/ the exchange, claiming they cannot refund your money. Not happy."
5,great tester,"This tester is great. Enough to do many jobs in your houses.The automatic selector of voltage is one advantage to non professional people.The open clamp is great but if you want to measure more than 100 amps you'll have to buy another one ( see Fluke 322 )You must be carefull with the teast leads, they are really sharp.I really recommend to buy with the T5, the starter kit."
4,Memoirs of a Civil War Grunt,"Most history books concentrate on the sweeping campaigns of the commanders, telling us that General So-and-So did what. In truth, it is the PBI or the average soldier that, suffering greatly, wins or loses the battles. In a way, any wage-slave of post-modern America can empathize with Corporal Sam Watkins."
4,A Great Reference!,"This is a compelling story of a young private during the Civil War. Sam Watkins gives a masterful account of his adventures in Tennessee, Georgia, and other states where battles were fought. He speaks of Missionary Ridge in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Watkins gives a very wholesome perspective on the death of many of his friends. This book is a great reference book and also just fun to read. Reading any book like this is that best way I know of tho teach true history. Who can tell us better about how history came about than people who were there when it took place?"
3,3 Stars,"If you want to create the type of AdWords campaigns that maximize the ROI for your marketing dollars, win you new business and increased customer loyalty, you need help from an industry expert."
4,Good Read,This was a very good book that gave an insight on some real gold diggers. This was a very good read and I highly recommended it. I was a little disappointed with the ending because it did not answer my question. (You will have to read the book to know what I am talking about). Overall this book was a good read. Keep up the good work.
4,"""Was It Worth It?""","The Paulettes, Reeses, Imeldas, and the Mildreds of the world give women a bad name. Lauren/Gideon and Gillian/Brandon compliment each other well. Max and Chris, maybe they should've gotten together. Paulette's death was totally unexpected, and Rowe's unconditional love for his mother(Reese) after the accident was tear-jerking. Ms. Howard's previous novels were good and this one is no exception."
3,Fun and entertaining,"A basic martial arts anime where the main characters have a pre-ordained destiny, There is the one good guy meant to fight the main bad and wether he wins or loses determines the fate of the world. Nothing really new and different but the execution was fun to see, the characters were typical but entertaining. The animation and special effect were slightly above average. All in all a fun romp once through but a re-watch would probably be years down the road after some memory loss."
5,Cinderella!,"I real intention was to purchase the Cinderella epic staring Leslie Ann Warren, but I purchased the wrong dvd. I would very much like to purchase Cinderella Ms. Warren, but at this I am not willing to pay more than $20.00 for a movie over 20 years old."
4,Made me a kid again!,"After listening to Rogers and Hammersteins Cinderella, I felt like a kid again back in the sixties. It totally transported me. I was amazed that I still remembered the words to most of the songs! Even though they were slightly out of order, I still enjoyed listening to the CD. One problem I had with the recording was Cinderella's step mother sounded very different on the cd then on the DVD. It was bothersome. Had they been the same woman, this reviewer would have given it 5 stars. Overall, I was very pleased with it...especially the price!"
4,Perfect for student note cards,"As a non-trad student who works during the day, I have started printing note cards of all my notes in tiny print (8-10pt)on business cards. I keep the notes by my desk at work and shuffle through them on breaks and transitions during the day."
1,Pebl phone,This phone was of no use to me. The phone was in chinese and so was the manual. This was not the phone amazon advertised. The phone I ordered was in english and unlocked. Amazon would not replace it for another one. Buyer beware.
2,Bulb doesn't work but the vendor is not ready to accept!,"I ordered this bulb for one of the buildings in our condo complex. I tried it on and it never worked. Called an electrician to check it out and his tests came out negative. I tried contacting the vendor to return the item. But kept getting emails asking How we determined that the bulb wasn't working,In fact the vendor even went far enough to say that electricians don't know how to test the bulb.I learnt a good lesson. I am going to order bulbs only from major retailers henceforth."
1,Fluorescent bathroom lamp model 4053,I bought 2 of these fluorescent fixtures and installed them in our remodeled bathrooms. Both died after 3.5 year of use. The bulb seems fine so it must be the ballast that gave up. Lights of America products may be cheap but they are real crappy quality products.
5,Could not find locally,Items were well packed. I was afraid that since the bulbs were delicate they might arrive broken but that was not the case. Items also arrived much sooner than expected.
2,Short life on bulb,"For a premium light, I expected years of service. What I have received is only three months of periodic use before it went black while it had been on for about an hour. There was no power surge and the lamp was plugged into a surge protector. Seems like bad quality control for all their promises."
5,Lights of America,"After using my Lights of America lamp for about 6 years, the bulb burned out. It lasted so long, I thought it would last forever. When the bulb wouldn't come on anymore, I really missed the light it provided. Amazon carries exactly the right replacement bulb I need and when it arrived and I replaced it in my lamp, and the light came on again I was thrilled! I use this lamp every day when I work at my desk and I'm very happy to have it back again. I'm sold on the Lights of America 9024B Fluorescent Linear Quad Bulb."
1,"Did not work, straight out of the packaging-->:(","I plugged this bulb into my Lights of America sun light lamp the moment I got it and was disappointed to find it not working. I wasn't especially surprised--I could hear the coil rattling around inside. The frustrating thing is it wasn't even worth the trouble of returning, just a waste of $10. I like to give sellers the benefit of the doubt as far as the packaging process goes but ought to have have heeded the other reviews on this one. I would have to recommend going with another seller."
5,I love it!,"This little music box/trinket holder is just lovely. The flowers on top are delicate and richly colored. It isn't really that small either. The trinket box bottom can hold several bracelets, a watch, earrings and regular rings all at the same time. I keep mine by my bed and take off all my favorite jewelry and put it there so the next morning it is all ready to wear again. I also keep several pairs of earrings there so I can choose what looks best for that day. Royal Albert music boxes tend to sound a little tinney, but this one is just fine and clearly plays Brahms Lullabey. It would make a lovely gift for a girl friend, mother, wife, or sister. I can guarantee she will love it."
3,Genuine Spielstabil?!,"Sturdy but hollow plastic. Dull in color, cheap plastic feel. Speilstabil, made in Germany, makes smooth, sturdy, bright-colored finished products. Classy. This ""Spielstabil Mole Hand Set"" does not feel authentic. No Spielstabil logo imprinted on product. Makes one question if it truly is Spielstabil?"
5,great item .....great seller,"I had a perfect experience with this product. From ordering to opening the box at home, everything was handled in a quick and professional manner. Awesome tool for any serious skateboard photographer."
3,Correction about Baltimora--it's not a re-recording or remix--it's the ORIGINAL,"The reason this version of Tarzan Boy may sound strange to many is because this is the ORIGINAL mix of the song from before it became popular. This is the first version I ever heard back in the early 80s on some alternative video show from Europe that used to air on one of the cable stations. So imagine my surprise back then when I finally found the song had been released in the US, only to find out it didn't sound quite like the version I had heard. This version is actually a treat for fans who knew of its existence, because it is RARE to find this version on CD."
4,Dissolves the misplaced spilt between sacred and secular,"I am really impressed with this CD. Each piece offers a different angle on the theme, highlights the best in the musicians and contributes to the movement of the whole. It wakes up the dance in me. I'll be planning some more orders soon, I'm sure. It will make a great gift."
5,Live,"I saw them a few weeks ago in Tahoe, I have to say, this album is hot, but hearing them perform live, unreal. To experience musicians now, who sound better in person than on the cd, are few and far between. Great cd, songs with heart and originality. Love it."
4,One of 3 useful books,"No one book was able to satisfy my research needs, and I ended up writing a two page memo that combined description with prescription in drawing out the best information across all three books (copy posted to OSS.Net Library under Reference). I deeply regret that I did know look into this ten years ago--both men and women need to understand this stuff before they hit 40. A great deal of emotional misunderstanding could be avoiding if *both* men and women absorbed this knowledge early on. Of the three books, this is the shortest, the easiest to read, and the simplist. The other two books that I recommend are Colette Bouchez, ""Your Perfectly Pampered Menopause"" (2005, the most time-consuming to read, but also the most up to date with some real gems of knowledge), and ""Menopause for Dummies"" which falls between the two books in utility."
3,TomTom Rider 2nd edition has been released,Just letting you know that release 2 of tomtom rider is already available in Europe and Australia and features the Cardo scala-rider wireless Bluetooth headset. I assume the US version will follow soon.
3,4 to 5 stars had there been color!,"This is an excellent book with tons of pictures. Foreword by Herb Adams the suspension king. There isn't really too much to say about it except for some great pictures, and it would probably be a ton better had the pictures been in color. Every year car up to the 30th anniversary is shown in this book. There are also a few customs and some of the other cars like the concepts. You won't be dissappointed, but you will with no color. Recommended"
2,Never Got It Right,"The first hose I was sent wasn't near what I'd ordered, wrong color, connectors, wrong handle. After an awkward conversation with GoVacuum, I was sent another hose, again, did not fit my BEAM central vac. Set both back and was given a prompt refund."
2,Not for Beginners,"I bought this DVD, having done Pilates before. I found that it moves very fast and is not for those who don't already know pilates moves. Her counting on the voice-over doesn't always match up with the demonstrations. There aren't any variations for movements if they are too difficult (especially for moms that have virtually no ab muscles after giving birth). There is nothing that makes this video specifically for the post-natal period. You may just as well get a Windsor video, which does more explaining with the moves."
4,Post-natal Pilates,"I liked this dvd a lot. I think it is a good dvd for getting back into the swing of things with pilates. It is not for months down the road when you have your strength & energy back & need something longer. I did her prenatal pilates during my pregnancy, so many of the moves were familiar. If this is your first time with this program I would suggest watching & practicing the moves first & then do the workout since it is slightly fast-paced, but once you know the moves it is easy to follow"
5,I Am My Mother Afterall,What a delightful way to bring back memories of Mom. A chuckle filled look at the many things mom said that we said we wouldn't but did anyway! Really enjoyable. I've just found another favorite author. I hope Lynne Alpern has written more books. I like her style.
3,Entertaining rather than convincing,"I put this one in the same category as several once-high-profile books on multiple personality disorder, which were also good reads for an idle evening but not to be mistaken for anything resembling factual presentations. I think Mr. Peck has let his imagination run away with him...and I'm puzzled that he doesn't seem fully aware that clinical depression can develop to psychotic levels and reduce its victims to pitiful, distorted shadows of themselves, as well as making them believe things that they'd scoff at while well. The second case history, of ""Beccah,"" is genuinely creepy and full of unaccountables. But just because something is creepy and unaccountable doesn't make it demonic possession. I wonder if some of the pathology represented in this volume isn't that of a clinician who badly needs and wants an explanation for obdurate illness and failed cures, and who has gone very far afield in his search for that explanation."
1,It's official.,"It's official now, M. Scott Peck was delusional. He believed in demon possession and conducted exorcisms with his psychiatric patients. His belief in the supernatural blinded him to the real explanations for mental illness and lead him to commit malpractice with his patients. While christianists and other gullible supernaturalists will love this account, the great majority of readers will simply find it comical. If America is in decline, it is because most Americans cannot deal with reality and instead seek comfort in medieval tales of demons and exorcists."
1,ICAM B.Frons must be stopped........,"I found the B.Frons review nothing if not completely accurate! Why not sell a DVD on the good ol' days cuz the days of ABC daytime 2004 have dwindled beyond recognition! It's definately a great concept, being that ABC Daytime Viewers are starving for a small taste of what used to be called Daytime at its best! Kudos to you Brian for knowing how to market a concept...too bad ABC Daytime isn't doing better, us long standing viewers DO NOT need to be reminded of the days when shows like GeneralHospital were good! Its etched in our minds cuz we are (shall I say were) fans! Dissapointed in NY"
3,"Excellent Score, Should have Given 4 stars, THANKS ANDREW!","The soundtrack to the Woman in White has ""grown on me"" over time, and I now find that I enjoy it very, very much. It is not Phantom or Superstar, but it is it's own thing--and it just totally ""works."" If I had to rate it today, I would give it 4 stars out of 5. As a matter of fact, I enjoyed the music so much that I bought the sheet music for piano. An excellent score Andrew, thanks!Best numbers: Trying Not to Notice,I Believe in My Heart, Lammastide,You Can Get Away with Anything, The Holly and the Ivy, If I Could Dream this World Away (which starts of great but goes downhill in quality), All for Laura (MAGNIFICENT), Evermore Without You, a song with the lyric ""Sweet Tension Fills the Air,"" and the Finale of Act 2, and the Seduction. Also, the book that this musical is based on by Wilkie Collins is phenomenal. Another Lloyd Webber classic. I've worn out my CD player...again."
2,A Gamble,"I love Andrew Lloyd Webber- and so I got this not knowing anything about it. It's ok, but I wish the songs had more of a tune. It was not my favorite of his."
2,A one-sided view...,"One can at once notice the meticulous research that preceded the writing of the book, the more surprising is that the author describes only the reasons why women were considered ""vessels of sin"" in that period of time and other hideous superstitions attributed to them. No line is dedicated (and to believe that history had not preserved any evidence of the contrary is laughable) about those mothers, mistresses, wifes, sisters that had been deeply loved, adored and respected. To creat an opinion that all women were either adored as saints or abhorred and violently subjugated, would be, to my idea, misleading...."
1,misinformation!!,The ad is a lie DO NOT BUY. I ordered two packs of (72) as advertised and 2 weeks later i received only 2 pencils total at a price over 4 dollars per pencil!
5,One singer to another,"I am a semi-professional singer, one of whose idols is the great Judy Garland. No one can even approach the woman's voice and performance. This book is heavenly. It clears up many of the myths and legends and lies and lays out the beauty in Judy's life. Great photos, too"
5,Damn! Those McCarrick Bros. are awesome,"I absolutely love this series. This is the second book of the McCarrick Bros. series and let me say you will not be disappointed. Hugh and Jane are great together. I love their chemistry during thier play time and thier fights. Hugh, so we thought, was the mild one of the Bros. McCarrick. But, that view had been altered. Hugh is a Bad Boy and Jane is his Sine. Great chemistry, great story, three dimensional characters. Loved it."
3,"Good unit, poorly packed","Nice unit, works well but very poorly packed. Small dents and bends from damage in shipping; stouter container and support necessary."
4,Good value for the money - bad packaging for shipping,"My thoughts are similar to many others: It is a good value for the money, it runs very quiet, starts easily and will be a good emergency generator. Documentation is poor, shipping carton is worse. Mine came with the air filter cover broken. I immediately emailed amazon as well as homier. Homier couldn't find my order and amazon says the part is not available separately. This is in spite of several other posters saying they got replacement parts. Amazon did offer to ship me another generator, which is kind of a pain or I would have done it. But the funniest thing is they asked if I wanted another generator or would I accept a 10% credit, then went ahead and processed the credit before I answered! I'm taking the credit just to be done with it, but wanted to warn others if there is more serious damage you will want to get a replacement."
4,Good if the Lights Go Out,"I bought this after looking around the area and even with shipping this was the best deal, but you get what you pay for. I wanted it as a back up to keep the fridge running in the event of a power outage and it will do that for sure. Put oil in and a little gas and after two pulls it started. It runs great, but it isn't quiet, more like a lawnmower. I would give this unit 4 out of 5 stars. I also got the wheel attachment, and I would give it 2 out of 5 starts. It is a generic wheel set not really made specifically for the Blue Max 4000. I had to MacGyver it and make a trip to the hardware store. The handle is a little light-weight for how heavy the generator is, but it works."
1,"So Far, Won't Work At All ....","We just purchased this generator. After struggling with the wheel set (very poor manufacturing) and following all of the (sometimes conflicting) instructions, we have not been able to get the generator to even turn over. We tried all the troubleshooting tips - including trying to check the sparkplug, but it is encased in the generator and not accessible! We are going to have to take this into a generator mechanics shop to see what is wrong - if they can't fix it, we'll send it back!I'll update this review after we have tried our next steps."
2,Deeply flawed,"This is an interesting book and quotes important stoties and localsources. Unfortunatly, it is deeply flawed by Mayor's lack of background in understanding First Nation's discourse about""monsters;"" beings that are connected to land, story and people."
3,Suits the purpose,"I bought this book as a reference. I already had looked at someone else's copy so I knew what I was getting. This book provides you with material to put a worship service or order of worship together. I am using it for the Presbyterian church, I don't know if it is used in other churches. It has a series of prayers and meditations that are useful to follow the lectionary calendar. It suited the purpose for which I bought it. I would not have bought it if I hadn't needed it for church services."
1,Don't bother...,"My time, and my dollar and nine cents could go to better use. Watching paint dry, perhaps with a cup of coffee. This book is a piece of one-off schlock by someone who obviously had her golden window of opportunity by ""being popular"" with the men in blue, and came to write this. The declining arc of her subsequent career moves leads me to wonder where her talent lay. Journalism? TV? Now she's spinning for the MPD. At least she gets to be in front of the camera from time to time. Good thing, too. She hasn't been able to pop out another book."
1,Yawn,"I was interested for the first few chapters, and then completely lost interest, which is crazy because I find the whole Dahmer story very intriguing. She talks far too much about journalism and what the police went through rather than telling about what was going on with Dahmer during all this, and it just seemed to me like she was bragging about being a good journalist who was in with the cops and that she was married to one. It took me weeks to read it just because I kept having to force myself to go on reading about all these things when I just wanted to know more about the man himself. She went to far off topic, it read like an extremely long drawn out newspaper article, and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
2,Predictable,"Predictable is how I'd describe ""Heartstopper,"" and that's a word I'd never use ordinarily when describing a Joy Fielding novel. I knew who the killer was fairly early on; I kept thinking, ""I always think I know who it is when reading her books, but I always end up shocked."" Well that didn't happen with this book. Maybe it's because I've read so many of her books, and that now they're starting to turn out the same. I didn't find myself as eager to turn the pages of this one as I have with some of her other books. It was even somewhat of a chore. She has definitely written better books."
1,False and Biased representation of history,"This book has many false and biased representations of history. It's depiction of Indian history is completely and utterly false. Check the statement that Indian civilization was influnced by Mesopotamia (which started around 6000-4000BCE) than check Indian civilization which started around (8000BCE). How can Mesopotamian civilization influence Indian civilization, if according to the book, Indian cilization started 2000 years before Mesopotamia? Should it not be the other way round? All these thinking came from MaCaulay's bias of a great civilization and Max Muller's obedience to Macaulay. Please write a better book with some true substance. Stop teaching kids false history."
1,This is NOT a movie,"This is a video of a boring lecture by Jason Martell who is speaking from a lecturn. The ""Search for Planet X"" is just one topic in the lecture."
5,Excellent Value Poker Chip Set,These are good quality poker chips in a strong aluminum case. Chips feel solid and heavy. There are 500. Excellent value for money at this price of less than $40.00
4,Good Quality for The Money,I bought this set for a poker tournament I got roped into hosting. I had never hosted a poker tournament before although I've played in a few. After reading reviews for the Fat Cat set I decided to give it a try. I was very happy with my purchase. The metal case is solid enough to take light abuse and does a good job of wrangling these chips. The chips themselves are of great weight and solid quality.The set includes big and little blind chips as well as a dealer chip and a pack of cards. We used our own cards as the cards in the set aren'tBicycle Playing Cardswhich I greatly prefer.For the money it's a great set and you get a lot of bang for your buck.
4,not bad,"This is a nice and professional set of chips and cards. It is REALLY heavy, so that is my only complaint, but I guess that that means that the chips are heavy so maybe it's a good thing. We should have to purchase a new set again for a while, but if we did, I would buy this product again."
4,Couldn't be better!,"Fat Cat Hold'em Dealer Poker Chip Set (500 Chips)I don't know about the complaints others had. I couldn't expect a more better set for the $29 I paid. Awesome deal. The clay chips really had good feel. Both the decks that came with the set were unusable after just abt 6 hrs of continuous play. But, that is ok. I could get some pretty good cards somewhere. Since the chips and case were way too good, this is pretty ok for me. I am glad and would definitely recommend anyone to get this."
1,Packaging was ridiculous,"Item damaged, chips bad detailed, product is really really bad finish, case was broken, I would recommend first to grab your money and throw it to the toillet"
1,Bottlecaps as chips are better than these,"Terrible chips - dull colored, badly printed, embossed off-center, poorly finished and unpleasant to the touch. I don't ask much of poker chips, but these are pure junk. Why even bother making them?? The best part is the ""Bce"" poker deck designed to resemble a Bee deck, that actually gave me a good laugh."
2,Cheap...,"The case came broken and is PLASTIC inside. Very cheap. I wasn't under the impression it was plastic and so poorly made. I wouldn't have ordered it. I'm stuck with it because I needed chips for my poker game. I'm going to order a new case but I thought someone buying this would like to know that the chips aren't marked, the case is cheap, and I don't see it showing up undamaged. IT IS VERY POORLY MADE!"
4,Very good set for the price!!,"This is a very nice set of chips for the price. I got it on gold box for $29.95 and free shipping, and it arrived in 3 days. One of the nice things about this set is that you get more low-denomination chips ($1 and $5) than higher denominations, unlike other 500-chip sets that give you equal amounts of 5 colors. With this set you can have a T100 tournament with 10 players no problem (15 whites, 11 reds, 3 blue). There are not enough high-denomination chips to have a T1000 tournament, unless you want to reassign colors. Another nice thing about this set is the case, which has 3 latches compared to just 1 or 2 on similar chip sets.The worst part about this set is the cards that are included, they are crap, which is why I'm giving this product a 4-star rating instead of 5. But that's not a reason not to buy this chip set, just do yourself a favor and order some good bicycle cards to go with it."
5,Gift,I purchased the set as a gift for my 17 year old grandson and he was delighted. It was the perfect size for the novice.
2,wrong color chips,I was holding a poker charity event and needed lots of chips ASAP and Amazon was great at shipping quickly BUT the Fat Cat Chip Set didn't come with any white chips as it was supposed to. These are usually used to represent one dollar chips and that is the demonination I needed the most. The event was the night after I received the set so I couldn't send it back.
4,wilko - a new discovery,"i saw Wilko - when he had some hair - on an old bbc live show withdr feelgood - well - he was the quirky one on guitar walking right upto the camera with those eyes, i compared him to a brtish version ofdavid byrne, later i saw hin with the great ian drury!impressed,tried to find a CD but way too expensive down in NZ.put it on my ""things to buy list""recently i found it on Amazon USA - 1/2 price new compared toa/one !applause all round :-)i was a bit dodgy about how he would sound vocally but was pleasantlysurprised.he still has that quirky guitar style on first few tracks but hisvoice + guitar improve towards the best two tracks at the end - a pair of Dylan + Van M covers =9.5 % as good as originals.a great CD!!!!"
1,"Only the author could earn, no one else","$50,000+. Fantastic. But how could he get that figure. In this book, no particular project could earn that amount. Everything is superficial with large cliparts to inflate the pages. The book could make money for the author, not for the readers."
3,Find a flag,This book had all the flags I am sure but it is very hard to find a flag if you have no idea what country it is from. I have no suggestions as to how it could be arranged to be more user friendly. It serves my purpose but not easily.
3,Good shoe for the price.,"Wouldn't pay full price for it, but the sale price made these shoes worth the buy. It's about a $30 shoe."
5,Ditto the 5 stars,"I LOVE this book, and so does my son (about 18 mo when we got it, now he's 2). I might be partial because I grew up on a farm and think goats are fun, but the illustrations are teriffic, the story is simple but interesting, and the goats do a few characteristically funny goat things. It's fun to watch little kid's faces when they begin to understand the humor (like when the goats start to nibble one girl's clothing at feeding time).I like it so much I bought another for my sister's daughter. (But I made sure to get the board book this time--accidentally ordered the paperback myself--oops!)."
4,Now I can use USB2 devices,"installation was straightforward, once I cleaned the contacts with an eraser. The USB2 device that was the reason for the purchase now works fine."
5,Memories from 1967,"This album brings back such fond memories. I was living in Mattapan which is a part of Boston at the time I heard this album. I was 7 years old in 1967 and I was also listening to seargent peppers lonely hearts club band. Both of these albums are imprinted on my soul and I will take my memories of these songs with me when I die. I especially loved the track ""Africa"". I highly recommend this album to all who love Arabic music.ALLAHU AKBAR!!! ALLAH KERIM!!!!"
2,"Pretty, but not informative","The illustrations are very nice and the book is in full color. But it's far too vague with its explanations. It really only serves as a brief introduction to the subject of perspective. I would recommend the book by G. White, which is a much more thorough treatment."
1,"Some good, some bad","There is lots of good advice in the book, but there are also at least two major issues I have that leaves a bad taste and makes me wary. First, Ray claims that a vegetarian diet is unhealthy. I've been a vegetarian for 30 years, I'm 65, I never get sick, I teach karate, do triathlons, and am VERY healthy. I am not unique. So, Ray is fos on this.Ray also keeps hawking a supplement (Juice Plus+) which is expensive and unnecessary. She pushes it so much in the book that I would be surprised if she is not financially tied to the product.All in all, I would not recommend the book: read Pollan instead."
3,What was the hype about?,"Let me first say that it's not that I disliked the book. But honestly, the book was nothing fresh. It's probably a good book for insecure people who to this day still feel guilty about dating people of another race. It'll comfort you. Or if you're in an inter-racial relationship, and need something to feed you a reason to self-indulge, this is a book for you. But otherwise, this book said nothing much but what we hear/talk about all the time. And some people say that the author did some amazing job in writing from the woman's perspective... Are you kidding? A woman that's supposedly have travelled internationally and educated fairly well will not see an Asian person and say ""Chinese"" to herself. That's more of a guy thing, if anything. An educated woman in an urban environment will not do that."
2,could have been better,"Mr. Dickey, I love the way you write but this book made me mad. I get so tired of hearing the same tired things about Black Women. We all don't have attitudes and get pregant. My angre is that I don't behave like that and I don't have any friend's who behave like that. Yes, it's true there are some who act like that but by writing this book it gives white women the idea that Black Women truly are aggressive angre women. If a Black Man wants to date a white woman because he is in love, Great! but don't make us (Black Women) out to be the bad guy because we all are not. If the Black couple in this book just truly did not get along and the Black Woman was a nice person it would not of bothered me but I get sick of these Black Men with these Racist attitudes toward their own women! Grow Up! lets work together. Date whoever you want but always respect your women in your race. Sorry EJD, I hope to read your next book. You are an excellent writer."
4,"Sensitive people, emotional issues. love and life.","Eric Jerome Dickey exhibits a strong senstivitity in the characters he creates. Readers know Jordan, Kimberly, Solomon, Zoe, Elaine and the Twins. It is unexpected that a man would create such reality and realism in the story. Unexpected twists, turns and outcomes keep you reading. This is a very enjoyable book."
5,A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BOOK ...,"This is a Fantastic book I've never read any of E.J. Dickey's books before, but I will continue to do so from now on. I could not put the book down. It is very well written and I would recommed it to all my friends...Keep up the good work."
1,Not Realistic,"This was my first book by EJD. I'm not African American so I can'tspeak to that side of the story, but I did find the characters in thisbook to be too one-sided (character of Jordan possibly excepted). Noone is THAT bad (the 'sistas') or that ""lily-white perfect.""People are complicated beasts, not to be described as simply good orbad. Also, the only reason Jordan eventually accepts Kimberly isbecause she has some ""black blood"" in her ancestry. Give itup. You may be black or white or any other ethnicity by blood, butknow nothing of the culture from which you hail."
3,Cream In My Java,"I really liked this book. I especially loved the descriptions of M.E.M.P.H.I.S- the Funkytown. I felt like I was right at home in ""Blackhaven"". I liked the characters okay, but I wish Eric could have depicted the black woman a little better. I am not sure how to take Kimberly. I have never had much sympathy for the ""tragic mulatto""--maybe I am just too harsh. I thought her ethnicity was a bit..contrived. Too convenient."
5,Love has no color,I am speechless when it comes to EJD. He is one great writer. I love all of his books and welcome many more.
5,Love it!,"I love everything EJD does, the man is a genius! I own almost all of his solo projects. I loved that this book like the others had many twists and kept me reading long thru the night."
4,Entertaining!,"Milk in my Coffee was great... it was funny , emotional, an very real. However, I would loved to see the author create a positive ,beautiful, and loving black women character in at least one of his books. All in all, I give four stars!"
1,Coffee Is Not My Cup of Tea,"Hated it! Hated the characters! It was dumb how the characters met and became a couple. Didn't quite get that. There are a few good laughs, but not like what you're accustomed to when reading an Eric Jerome Dickey novel. He made black women seem evil and ignorant... Come on, Eric! You can do better than that!!! Readers want material that's readable and interesting; not fairy tailish and uncredible. Better luck next time!"
5,THIS BOOK CAPTURES THE TRUE SOUL OF YOUNG PEOPLE,"MILK IN MY COFFEE IS EXCELLENT. PEOPLE ARE RAVING ABOUT IT EVERYWHERE. IT IS A MUST READ. I JUST COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. EJD HAS OUTDONE HIMSELF! WELL I HOPE NOT--CAUSE I JUST CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT ONE!! FROM HIS FIRST BOOK TO THIS ONE, HE HAS BEEN KEEPING IT REAL. WE LOVE YOU AND DON'T EVER STOP."
5,So delicious and true you gotta stop and listen to da man!!!,"MIMC is as real as it gets, and you can take that from a redheaded white woman dating a brotha, and we lived in Memphis together (born and raised) for 4 years! He writes with a passion that is deliberate and incredible, and he goes where too many are scared to go. I'm impressed!!! I picked it up and finished in 5 hours, and I was sucked into the novel in 5 seconds flat. Although the book wasn't always a black-white issue, I gotta say he punched about a million buttons with me. Luckily, most interracial relationships don't have the head trips Jordan gave himself (and he came through!), so props to the strong ones. Keep em coming, EJD!!"
3,Good but not Great,Three stars is in no way a knock on this CD. I'm a big Cash fan and enjoy this CD but at times it can be a bit slow. It's just Johnny and a guitar. I think Personal File is more a fit for serious Johnny Cash fans.
4,Wanted the softest putty I could find.,"The putty is soft, but a rating of XX-soft I do not think is correct. The putty is sort of stiff and becomes pretty soft after your hands warm it up. I am using this to make magnetic putty so I needed the putty to be super soft."
5,"Awesome runners.. lengths are end of loop, end of loop.","I must confess. It took awhile for me to remember that 30cm is approx a foot and runner lengths are given in their reach. I sew my own now so its really ingrained. If I want a 120cm or 4 ft runner I need 8 ft of webbing plus the extra 4 inch's I use as a sewing allowance. I really like nylon runners.. I think their far superior to the new synthetics like Dyneema and Spectra. They take a sudden load better.. go to DMM and watch their video on runners and drop tests. I think you'll agree.. Better than worrying about factory size's, sew your own. Make them any length you want and fix up the old slings on those cams at the same time. In a year or so you'll save up enough dough to buy a whole new set of cams. You can buy bulk webbing right here on Amazon."
4,Mob Culture 101,"Despite being a novelty book that can be read in its entirety on a lazy Sunday afternoon, Joe Pistone's ""The Way of the Wiseguy"" is as entertaining as it is insightful in allowing us to take a glimpse into the twisted world of the mafia. Expect no deep thoughts here though, just a series of anecdotes illustrating the basics of mob life (i.e. how to set up a racket, how hits are carried out, the mob hierarchy, etc). Some stories are hilarious, others are depressing, and some are just plain sick. Either way, anyone with the slightest interest in organized crime will surely not be able to resist at least browsing through, seeing how the story of Pistone's infiltration of the mob is legendary."
2,Don't waste your time.,"The book has like 30 chapters whcih might make you think there is a lot of material. Not so. Many ""Chapters"" are 1 or less pages long. The whole book is basically anecdotal tales of Pistone's time in the Mafia. While it may be correct, it's very superficial. One or two stories per topic.The last reveiwer was right. Lot's of profanity. It's almost as if he's trying to talk to people who are thinking of joining the Mafia just to let them know how it is. Not a lot of big words if you get my idea.Also, for a < 200 page book, there is a lot of repetition. Each chapter could exist on it's own, so you end up reading about Joe/Donnie's sit-down more than once.If you have seen any mob movies and the Sopranos, you know everything this books tells you. Even worse, is that he mentions Godfather and Goodfellows several times and mentions the Sopranos only once. Not that I really care, just that it's current and obvious that he is just cashing in on Soprano's current popularity."
1,Bad -period!,"This is all about $$$ and more $$$. His bank account must be getting low. It is has NO depth what so ever. Very very brief to say the least. Old stories re-invented.Mr.Pistone should have been indicted for his role in the many crimes he participated in to convince these people he was one of them. There is NO way he did not violate state & federal law to convince them he was a fellow criminal as well.If your invloved with law enforcement you can not become a criminal-or a criminal orginization to investigate criminals & associates. He has blood on his hands.I applaud honest, couragous, and loyal law enforcement, however this stinks!Pistone could NOT have stayed six years undercover without participating in serious crimes to warm up to these players PERIOD. Think about it!!!!!!!!!!2 thumbs down............dont waste your $$$"
2,Disappointing. . .,"Not as bad as the horrible movie adaptation of Pistone's original book, but still nowhere near as good as his first memoir was. This one's reads mostly like a scattered collection of notes he took daily for the past decade . . . quite empty and pretty much pointless. The CD with the snippets of surveillance is a nice touch but I wouldn't say it's worth the price. If you can pick it up for three-four bucks (WITH the CD), then do consider it . . . otherwise -- skip it and go for some Capeci or Pileggi."
2,Doesn't quite cut it,"""Coyote"" was an impulse buy, and the ""steal a starship"" set-up was so contrived and preposterous that I almost gave up on the book - Amazon reviewers suggested I hold on for the Coyote part, which WAS a lot better, and I finally enjoyed the book enough to try this sequel.Although these stories are well crafted and generally connected to the rebellion plot in a ""life on the hard frontier"" context, they often felt more like writing exercises to me, especially the one about a bio-engineered bat/man vampire dude who arrives on Coyote leading his religious cult (as if someone said ""I challenge you to write a Coyote story involving a vampire"" - this is hard SF?!?). This book seems more like a Wild West story set on another planet, with rugged freedom-loving rebels fighting the oppressive, power-hungry socialist overlords. But there are weird animals and plants, and some strangely selective advanced technology thrown in for good measure. And a vampire. Oy."
5,Coyote Rising,"Even though I read this book before Coyote, I was able to know right away what was happening. It is full of action and has a great storyline. Others have already said many great things about this book better than I ever could. I would really recommend this book to anyone who likes science fiction or reading in general. Just make sure to also read Coyote."
1,This thing really sucks,"Bought this one because it's cheap, then the price really tells the story. It took me whole 2 hours trying to figure out the stupid Config. utilities, still wouldn't connect with my Netgear router. Changed to a netgear adaptor, up and running in 5 minutes. In the process of returning this useless toy."
4,Backing band comes to the fourth.,"""Harry Hibbs Fourth"" marked a moment in the recording career of the quiet unassuming traditional player. His traditional sound was broadening thanks to an ambitious production job by Ray Kent and moreso by an accomplished backing band. The Caribou Showband start to spread their wings with superb guitar playing by Johnny Burke, dynamic fiddling from bluegrass legend Brian Barron and driving percussion by Roddy Lee. Lush arrangements with several backing vocalists make the whole album sound bigger. Highlights include: ""Pub With No Beer"", ""Memories"", ""The Hirin Far"", and ""Harbour Le Cou""."
2,How do you mess up a film with Nazi Zombies and Werewolves?,"Simple, don't have Nazi Zombies in the movie. Have Nazi Almost Zombie creature things in the movie. Then introduce (for no apparent reason) a werewolf that doesn't do anything throughout the movie. I was really disappointed in this one. The actual movie was less interesting than the trailers I saw. This movie has no plot, the acting is terrible and I assure you my 2 1/2 year old niece could have designed better make-up and creature fx."
2,It came wrapped in plastic...but dirty,It was a white sweatshirt with black streeks all over it. Wow!!! That was really annoying.
4,happy,"fits well and it's white which, for some reason, is very hard to find in a men's jacket. two words"
2,very light weight,This hoodie was practically see through. Nothing like the one we bought a few years back. I returned it.
5,Wonderful Woodstock Percussion Olympos Chimes OWS,"The chimes are amazing. The sound was extremely pleasing and reminds me of temple bells I actually went on to the Woodstock website where they let you listen to every chime and then I zero-ed in on this particular chime. Also, the product is only offered in silver, but it looks as beautiful as it sounds!"
2,Misleading,"The book should be renamed to Microsoft Exchange Connectivity Guide for Exchange server 4.0 if there'll be a revise version in future. I highly recommend ""Implementing Exchange Server"" for experienced exchange architects or consultants who are setting out to design, implement, and then administrator an exchange server systems.because that book is designed for a very specific audience,experienced exchange guru or dream want to be."
5,Great for culinary students,Great book for students in a culinary program. explains a lot. A little in depth for the home cook. But I would recommend this book highly for any culinary student to have on hand for the intro to baking class; or the Artisan bread class.
2,mala calidad en los dvd,"Buena presentación de los DVD y muy deficiente calidad de las películas. No obstante teniendo en cuenta el precio, considero una aceptable compra."
3,Most if not all the movies are also included in 250 pack.,"I just want to point out that most, if not all, the movies are also included in 250 pack from the same company. I checked this movie by movie :) Depending on your purchase plan, that one might represent better bargain."
5,Bargain B movie Nostalgia,Wonderful nostalgic entertainment for very little money...try and collect all 50 movies separately at this price!
3,"Lots of content, uneven quality, questionable audio/visual reproduction","For the money, this is a deal!!There are many films here I had never seen or even heard of, along with some amazing favorites. The variety is great, but some of the lesser known films are true dogs. The picture and sound quality is sometimes quite poor, very uneven copy. Films from 1964 can be in WORSE condition than films from the 1930's.Anyway, I'm glad I bought it."
3,"Not bad, but not all ""horror""","As others have noted, this set and other 50-pack sets, have uneven quality on many of the pictures. But I have found most things watchable. What was disappointing is that a few things are far from ""horror"". For example, there is Swamp Women about female criminals running around Louisiana's swamps with a hostage and an undercover femaile detective looking for stashed diamonds. Another example is The World Gone Mad about a murdered District Attorney who investigated a financial fraud and the reporter trying to find the killer(s).As to the ""classic"" nature, someone else mentioned the great Universal series of films. This set has very old and/or very grade B & C kinds of ""classics."""
4,"Great bargain, good collection!","Horror Classics Collection: 50 Movie Pack brings you a wide selection of public domain horror films.In addition to horror flix, there are a couple of mystery movies tossed in.Print quality ranges from poor to satisfactory and the sound on a couple of the films is pretty bad.Bela Lugosi fans and ""B"" movie connoisseurs will be happy to see many Monogram, PRC and other ""poverty row"" studio productions here.Some true horror classics (Phantom Of The Opera, Night Of The Living Dead, White Zombie) are here along with other ghouls, ghosties, monsters and mad scientists (including the great George Zucco), plus some films I never heard of and will probably never watch again!The fun factor of this set can't be beat - especially if you consider the low price (I paid $16 with shipping!).Definitely worth a look!"
3,A Case of the Classics.,"If you enjoy watching some of the old-time horror films, especially those you can't find regularly anymore, this is the collection for you. This series (along with another one I've seen out there) is a fantastic addition to the movie-lover's library.Contained within the set, you have just about every classic horror film from as early as the silent 1922 ""Nosferatu"" (still in black and white) to such more ""recent"" films as the black and white 1959 ""The House on Haunted Hill"", the 1960 ""The Last Man on Earth"", and the 1968 ""Night of the Living Dead"". There are some rather mediocre ones that everyone probably had wished would have been forgotten, but if you are a film entrepeneur who is establishing a collection or a university professor of film or history, this is an invaluable collectible and/or educational resource."
1,Terrible,Has maybe 5 movies worth watching. Will either give to goodwill or just trash them. Glad I did not spend much.
2,False Advertising,"I happen to love old horror films, but most of these are jokes. First of all, none are classics. I mean Dracula and Frankenstein are not in it. There are a lot of old mysteries in it like the Boris Karloff Mr. Wong movies. They're entertaining yes, but not horror classics. There are a few that wouldn't even rate one star, such as Maniac and Beast of Yucca Flats. You wonder why they would even waste film to make these horrible movies. A lot of crap is loaded into this collection that has bad sound and film condition, obviously most of them are public domain and have never been restored. Believe it or not, the best of the lot are The Screaming Skull, The Killer Shrews, and The Giant Gila Monster, and they're just corny movies from the 50's. I tossed every disk out after just one watching. Why? Because I know that I'll never waste my time watching them again. Don't waste your money. Why else would you get as many as 50 movies at such a low price?"
2,Missing some real classics,"There are a lot of titles in this collection, a few are even classics, but it's missing some of the obvious classics: Boris Karloff's THE MUMMY, FRANKENSTEIN and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN with Elsa Lanchester, Bela Lugosi's DRACULA, and Lon Chaney Jr's THE WEREWOLF."
2,Not really classics,"These movies are really hokey and campy and never were classics. Save your money and buy some good Boris Karloff, Vincient Price or Lon Chaney."
2,Sounded better than it really is,Getting the family to watch any of these is like pulling eye teeth...and they were all for buying it!
5,30 cents per movie!,"This is by far the best money I've spent in a LONG time. You have to remember one thing about these movies though - Back in the 20s, horror had a different taste. Good old Frankenstein didn't show up on the screen until 1931! Everyone knows Frankenstein, Dracula, Mummy, etc... I'm personally glad they they didn't include films of those types in this collection. How many people know of The Killer Shrews? This is a fine collection for for what I paid. Five stars all the way!"
1,Should be Zero stars,"I regret buying this book. I was fooled by the reviews. It is absolute crap. Plot is predictable, story and characters are unrealistic, a complete waste of time. It is not material for a serious reader of fiction."
2,Insatiable,"The book was ok, it started off rather slow then took off in the wrong direction. The book is nothing what the title Insatiable suggests. It seemed as if the author got lost in her thoughts and/or confused about her characters."
5,Puppy Warmer,"I really enjoy this home hearth heater, it looks great is easy to move about and it is my Boston Terrier's favorite place to nap, he plants his nose where the heat comes out in the front of the unit. I am thinking of purchasing another one for my bedroom."
3,Works,"Cheap, allows you to do your own measurements. I question the accuracy because the tape can get tight. Seems like a regular soft tape measure is just as effective as long as you have the movement and ability to measure accurately."
4,Its nice,"It's much easier to use than a regular tape. I'm not sure how well it's constructed, but for the price you can't really beat it."
4,NIce,For the price you can not go wrong. This thing has a little hole to hold the tape while you measure yourself which is kool if you have no one to help you. I am happy with my purchase.
4,Nice body tape,"I like that this tape measure is inside an encasment which keeps it easier to keep up with. It tends to stick every once in awhile but really it's not that hard to pull a couple of times to get it started again. I would purchase again because of the convenience and easy to read numbers. I also like that it's not something my husband would grab and use instead of his metal tape measure so I have one on my own and he has his own and I don't have to hear, ""what did you do with my tape measure this time""?"
2,Click tape,"Not very impressed with the Myotape, it has a clicking action that locks the tape at 1/4 inch intervals which doesn't allow the tape to accurately be used unless you are able to see the measurement."
4,Works well enough,This product works well enough for the price. There is only one thing that I wish they would fix: sometimes the little plastic end piece comes out of the groove when you are trying to make a loop to measure something (like your arm/waist/etc...) and it comes recoiling in really fast and can really hurt if it hits your fingers. Just a simple cover or something would solve this problem. Hopefully they can address this issue in the future. Other than that it works pretty good.
3,"Fantastic concept, execution needs a little tweak...","I was worried that my measurements weren't consistent in tension (therefore giving me sad or inaccurate news of my progress), so I thought the price of this was worth a try. My biggest beef is that the plug/socket idea that makes this self-looping isn't totally secure. I'll get it around my arm, put the end in its holder, and before I can press the button to tighten it, the end will pop out, and I have to start the process all over again. If they could make that more secure, this would be an AMAZING product - myself, I'm thinking of adding some stick-on Velcro to improve it myself!"
4,Measures accurately,"I wanted a tape measure that was accurate and I could keep it in place while I was measuring. This does the job for a really reasonable price. I do find that one has to be careful once the tab is placed in the holder not to push it or it could come out. Also, once you have measured something, you need to be careful not to tug on the tape or let it slide back which will change the measure. All in all this is a really good product that is easy to use, not flimsy, and made for a person to measure themselves without help."
4,convenient measure,It obviously is functional with a slot for the plastic silynder end. I deduct one star for the very end part of the measure then to get wrinkled as I use so I am a little bit concerned whether it is still correct or not.
2,"Defective tape measure begins at 2""","I was so happy to see the description of this tape measure, and it indeed works as described. However, there's a big problem. When you pull it out to measure, it actually starts at about 2 inches--making the accurate measuring of anything require subtraction. It's ridiculous! Whatever happened to quality control? If you look at the pictures, you can see that most of them only show it starting at 2"". One reviewer even wondered if she had to add 2 inches to her measurement--which would end up with her getting it wrong by four inches. The trick is to subtract 2 inches. But why would they make it that way? It seems like, in wrapping the first part into the little anchor piece, they simply wound up too much. BUt it can't be unwound any more, at least the one I have can't. I'll probably keep it, because any tape measure is better than none. But it's too bad. They should fix this."
3,Some Funny Moments,"The book has its fun moments where Kerry gets into typical chick-lit situations. Her analyst has her recording her ""mortifying moments"" in a journal. Kerry seems to have more than her share currently and in the past(breaking up with boyfriend on prom night, getting arrested for kidnapping when she stages an intervention with a girlfriend).Unfortunately it's hard to keep all her fellow employees, friends and family straight. You feel little sympathy for her work problems when she's an obvious goof off. She tries to change her karma by volunteering, but her focus is on herself rather than the teen being mentored.For fans of the Shopaholic books, this attempt lacks the breeziness and light touch that Kinsella achieves. I kept wanting to like the book better, but it seemed to drag on and on."
1,Stinks!,"I was highly disappointed with this product. The product itself does not have a pleasant aroma. Maybe a guy would prefer this shampoo but I didn't like the smell. I also didn't feel as though it did anything special for my hair.If you do decide to purchase, don't pay more than about $10.50! The retail value at Target is $10.49 and online for Target is $10.99 The vendor here has it for more than $14 (which I didn't realize was above retail and paid). To get a refund back it would cost me as much in shipping to return it.I was disappointed that the retail listed on this product was not it's true retail value. No way does it originally cost $37.I would not recommend this product."
4,Great shampoo,Overall the product works really well. Oppossed to buying elsewhere it is fairly cheap up here. Although I did receive the incorrect product. They were very courtesy and issued my money back as well as a credit if I reorder it.
2,Not exactly right,Says it's 1/4- in but will not work with 1/4- in fittings have to use 1/8- in fittings. Not a big deal but I had already picked up fittings at the hardware store and then had to make an extra trip to swap them out.
5,GREAT.,Does not take up much room. Installation was easy. Installed on basement joices. Great workout. Easy strap adjustment for different exercises. Exercise booklet included easy to use with effective routines. Love it.
5,A lesson to be learned,"I love this series of books and have enjoyed in each one a life lesson to be learned. I can always picture the whole series of events taking place and once I start reading one, it is hard to put it down until I am finished."
4,Always Pleasant to Spend Time at Zebra Drive,"While I thought the book moved along a little more slowly than previous offerings in this series, it was a very plesant amble back to Mma Ramotswe's Africa. It's another gentle, wise read best accompanied by the tea of your choice."
4,And the story continues...,"While this addition to the ""No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency"" saga begins a little more slowly than its predecessors (in my humble opinion), Smith continues to deliver the wit and wisdom of Mma Ramotswe in an entertaining and enlightening fashion. Another delight for the heart and mind."
4,The Good Husband of Zebra Drive,Once again Alexander McCall Smith entertains us and uplifts our spirits as Mma Ramotswe and her colleagues deal with human nature and developing world economics with resourcefulness and grace. Kudos to Mr. JLB for his quick thinking!
4,Lacks suspense,"I've been a fan of this series since the beginning, and especially impressive is that the author has so far avoided being repetitive. Very few authors can write more than a few books in a series and avoid falling into a stylistic rut. These stories remain enjoyable, even at #8, an enviable testimony to the author's writing ability.My only criticisms of this book are that, while the characters are drawn beautifully as always, there is even less suspense than usual, and there seems to be little growth in the characters. The mysteries were unusually mundane, and the resolutions easily anticipated. In two places it seemed characters might be changing and growing; I was disappointed when this turned out not to be so.In short, the book is enjoyable, but it lacks some of the suspense of the earlier books, and the characters are in danger of stagnating. Not bad, just not quite as good as the rest of the series."
5,Wrong Address,I had given the wrong address but the seller was patient and gave me a refund. I will use him again.
3,Initial Impression,"I just received this book in the mail and opened it up. I am a little disappointed the book I received is a ""First Edition"" where the copyright is 2000. If I understand this correctly, the information in the book is ""as of the 2000""; eight years ago.I bought this intending to use it along with my recently opened E*Trade account. I now expect there to be significant differences between what the book is showing and what the current E*Trade website looks like. If the book is just sticking to the fundamentals this will probably turn out just fine; time will tell.I wish I had been able to tell the year when the book was published before the decision was made to purchase but that is information that needs to be added to the Amazon website and not a criticism of this specific book."
1,Manufacturing defect,"Received the Dragonfly and Water Lily nightlight in good ship time. However quickly noticed the electrical prongs were reversed and would not plug upright into any standard electrical outlet. Product did not qulaify for exchange, had to refund.Was difficult to find out if this was a batch production error or just a fluke."
4,Wow really fun!,"This is a really cool addition to the already fun Geotrax, but not neccesarily good for 2 1/2 year olds. The whole elevation series is hard to build so the 2 1/2 year olds get bored quickly, the proper age is probably 3 1/2.But the mountain is really fun. Two thumbs up."
4,STILL killin' it!,"Granted, this wasn't his best work. But it's still a great album. Anyone looking to buy a Michael Bolton album, take a good look at this one. I'd recommend buying if you own ""Time Love and Tenderness."" If not, buy that first. But if you got your eyes set on ""The One Thing,"" it's worth buying."
1,Perhaps the worst ever,"Dispite the other review,which now you must be the judge,This BAD attempt an movie makeing,should be on the dollar and less rack.I grew up loveing old sci fi/horror flicks,the cheezyer the better,In my openion this is so awful,its not even cheezy."
4,Great buy,"Alot of good music, it was a great price, it came in a neat little package. It made a great gift."
5,Great American artist,"I grew up in the rural midwest, so I relate to the values and perspective of John Mellencamp's work. He is a talented songwriter, and this is a comprehensive collection of his work. I own Scarecrow and Lonesome Jubilee, and bought this to round out the John Mellencamp selections loaded on my iPod."
4,Fat TesterA great,"A great device; simple, cheap, and useable. I'm still not happy with the results it gives me, but thats my problem. Good service from Amazon as always."
4,Works Perfectly,"The only reason that I rated the product four out of five stars, is because it was not one of those fancy electronic ones. Even though it is only five bucks and it is simple, it does exactly what it was supposed to do."
4,Works great!,"I received the item quickly and it was as described. It works great, however, the plastic is a bit thin and feels a little flimsy. Still a great product though that does the job for a great price! I recommend it :)"
3,Accurate but need mastery...,"It seems that the reading is accurate, the only drawback is the proper placement of the caliper which is 3 inches above the right side of illiac crest. Athough, accuracy of measurement will happen once you master using it. So, you need to master using it before you will get an accurate reading."
2,Not worth my time,"The Accu-Measure Fitness 3000 Personal Body Fat Tester might seem like a easy, cheap way to measure your body fat, but it's really not that easy. You need to measure the location every time, and it might not be very accurate. I decided to buy a scale and will check the accuracy."
4,Simple to use,"Product was as descriped, and offers a cheap alternative to the scales that measure your body fat. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to track their body fat. Very ease to use."
1,Useless,The price enticed me to buy it. Buy a coffee instead! Useless!Accu-Measure Fitness 3000 Personal Body Fat Tester
4,Worth it,"The calipers are worth the price (<$10).You can use them to track your fat loss progress, or just to give you a ballpark of your body fat %, but don't use them for maximal accuracy.The chart that comes with it is pretty much useless, but you can always find one of the online bodyfat calculators that use the caliper measurements.Overall, it was worth the money"
3,Medium fat tester,"This tool would have received a 4 or 5 stars if the click mechanism they have for signaling that you should stop pressing it worked better. I wouldn't buy this tool again, but if you are really paying attention you could get accurate results (more or less)."
2,Can't figure it out.,It's probably me but I couldn't get it to work. Sounds simple to do but when you try it-not so easy.
4,Pretty Easy to Use,"Simple, pretty easy to use. I did end up googling the correct way to measure my body fat though but overall a simple tool."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I have been looking for a set of plain plastic calipers. These are just what I wanted. Simple, easy to use, and with a little practice for consistency, very reliable. With electronic devices you have fluctuations based on hydration levels and other factors that cause results to be different at different times of the day. This product reads the same at any time of day.It also does not require getting on the scales in order to moniter body fat. Reduce body fat and the inches will always go as well. That is not always true of the the fluctuating scale.Sometimes simplicity is just so good."
3,The Price Was Right,"I'm sure my opinion will go up once I've mastered the clever art of body fat measurement, but for now I'm just going to say it's okay."
2,"Bad design, inaccurate results.",The tester has a moving plastic piece in the middle that you are supposed to set all the way to the right before making a measurement. This makes it almost impossible to take accurate measurements. Also the instrument doesn't click so you don't know how much pressure to use.
3,"Cheap, but you get a number!","I need to do some sort of comparison to a Lange Caliper or Skyndex or Hydrostatic Weighing to validate the accuracy of the unit. However, it is durable and seems to offer good test-restest reliability."
3,It works,"Its cheap and its plastic and not real sturdy, but it does what its supposed to and you can't expect much more than that for the price. I'd buy it again for what it is."
1,poor quality,"that was not the same product as i was buying before.the liquid was watered 15 times,not worth the mony."
3,Don't Recall,"The producted was packaged well, was exactly what I wanted, received what I order and it was odelivered on time as tracking information stated....."
3,you may want to avoid certain dealers esp one with less than 96%,"be careful for a dealer with less than 96%!!!the packs are well worth the money-tho some are blurry. one disk #11 was so bad i could not view the last movie on each side.i still considered it a fair enough deal (get what you pay for). still i told a certaon dealer about the bad disk.they promised to send me a good disk -- but none came.after another email from me they gave me a tracking number which turned out to be for someone else at another address.i emailed again-- but they never replied again.i was too nice. the time expired to file a claim. i cannot even leave them feedback, to warn others so i have turned here. so tho they may be ownwed and run by decent swell people, my experience leads me to warn others to avoid them. (check their crappy recent feedback)."
2,Mr. L. Mapes,"I was very disappointed in the product. For the most part, they were a very poor quality of recordings. I realized that they were old, but with the new computor knowledge that we have, I would have expected the DVD's to be better. I guess the only answer to this poor product, is I got what I purchased. A very poor product for Amazon to be selling."
5,Fantastic Mysteries,"I will admit that I absolutely love mysteries. But even bypassing my love of them, this 50 pack of movies is fantastic to the extreme. So if you love old movies, especially mysteries and crime, I can only say one thing to you, BUY IT. I am up to the fifth disc, there is two sometimes three movies on each side - A and B sided discs. Enjoy your viewing, I am."
1,Wierzbicka's academic fluff chokes meanings.,"I read this book for an athropology class at a western private university. I have to say that while Wierzbicka's domination of different languages is impressive, her ""fluffy"" explanations of the key words in the book tend to bore the reader, thus leaving him/her more confused about the meanings of the key words than before. Furthermore, her findings tend to undermine her own premise that a culture's key words cannot be understood except by understanding the culture itself. No one person can claim to explain--as she does--what certain words mean within their cultural realm without having been immmersed totally in that culture (usually born and raised). Thus, one is lead to believe that even she doesn't understand the ""key words"" totally, and her credibility is therefore undermined. I wouldn't recommend the book to anyone with less than a Ph.D. in Linguistics."
2,Distracting Diatribe,"The subtle attacks on Microsoft products throughout the book (particularly at the beginning) was distracting.If you're a Windows fan, you won't like this book; if you're a Linux fan, you'll love it. If you can appreciate the merits of both, it will probably just annoy you."
5,The squishy grandma,I liked it when grandma drank the medicine and smoke came out of her mouth and she said I am on fire! And when they gave it to the chicken. I liked it really much. I think children 7 and up should read this book because I think you will really like it.
3,ADULTS ONLY!!,"Though the book is supposed to be a Children's book, I wouldn't let my child read it. In fact I wouldn't even read it to him. An adult will be able to enjoy this book, but a child will probably try to copy George, not at all recommended."
5,Favorite book growing up,I think every child and adult should read this book. It's hilarious and imaginative. Roald Dahl writes the best children books. This book also made want to go into science
2,1989,"Jade Warrior released this recording in 1989. Being a devote fan, I bought it in CD format, which was still not the norm in '89. I was extremely dissappointed. All the fire and peaceful passion is missing from this recording. I just found out that it is the last recording Tony Duhig was involved with at all. He passed away in 1990 from what I understand.Just be aware of two things: Tony does play on this, but not that much and this recording is geared for the ambient audience. It is not typical even of what John is still capable of. Buy it because it is the last known recording that Tony played on."
3,Could be much more concise,"The Authors are clearly experts. They are clearly enthusiastic about their topic. I have little doubt that mastering the material in this book would lead to a passing grade on your test. Just know that you are taking the long way around the mountain.My goal was to PASS THE TEST in a reasonable amount of time, with actual comprehension of the material. I was not looking to know everything there is to know on the topic. I didn't care to wade through minutiae and exhaustive background info on every topic. The exam covers a great deal of information & I didn't want to add to it unnecessarily. So, eventually, I gave up on this book and read Network+ Certification All-in-One Exam Guide, Third Edition (All-in-One) by Michael Meyers and Exam cram. I passed with a 750 out of 900. I will keep this book for reference and further research. But, I can't recommend it as a Network plus study guide as there are much more efficient ways to pass that test."
5,Spirtual Authority,A must read for anyone who claims that Jesus is Lord of their life. You cannot be a person of authority until you have met the King of all authority. Excellent reading and life changing.
5,Knowing the Kingdom of God,This book opens the believer's eyes to the auhtority issues many deal with in their daily life. It explains the necessity of living in submission to the Kingdom of God. Authority strikes at the core of rebellion's desires. Every believer needs to read this book and apply its lessons to their daily life as they walk with God.
3,"yes, it's a 70s tv show","This TV series was run on late night ABC TV in the late seventies under the title ""Legend of the Black Hand"". Each episode is a separate story and each has a different cast. The series was capitalizing on the Godfather-craze of the times. Acting and production values were good (not great) for the time, and I kept wishing there had been a second series, which to my knowledge there was not. The plots become predictable and by today's standards are almost cliche.Having said that, for some reason, I remember it fondly."
3,bracelet,"A very pretty bracelet, but I have already lost 1 of the stones. You shouldn't have to worry about things like that on an item that you only wear occasionally."
4,Didn't realize how worn out my old ones were!,"After 8 months of thinking, ""these (foam inserts that came with my E3c's)will last forever"" I broke down and ordered these replacements as the originals were getting quite dirty. Whoa! The new ones made me realize how much my originals had hardened. My great sound and comfort was back - and the decay was so gradual I didn't even realize what I was missing!So, 5 stars for performance, but 3 stars for what amounts to some pretty expensive foam ear plugs. Avg=4stars."
5,The Favorite Advent Book!,"There is a little button to push at the end of the story- is it the sound of snow falling or maybe the sound a star makes when it twinkles! LOL-Our daughter paired it with a ""snow"" art project- the two preschooler watercolored paper then sprinkled the wet paper with kosher salt- as it drys it makes snow."
1,UNcomplete Guide to Prescription & Non prescription Drugs,...Readers and users of this book need to know that it is incomplete and not easy to follow. I take Coreg and it isn't even listed!! ...
5,Photo Assets,"Every good photographer should own this..., period. This is an essential tool to master exposure and color to capture amazing images."
1,Too flimsy - more like toy store jewelry,"I thought these looked very nice in the online photo. Light is nice in a hanging earring but these just aren't substantial enough; you can tell they are stamped, and they look more like they come from a toy store for playing dress-up."
3,The Wall live 2 dvd the Pink Floyd sound review,"Worth having if you're a fan. Come on! its a live 1980 show, when Rick Wright (RIP) was on his way out!!Sadly the Final Cut followed, which basically killed the bandThe Wall was the last legitimate Gilmour/Waters collaboration. The Final Cut could easily have been a Waters solo album, barring the odd guitar solo on Fletcher Memorial Home!"
4,stop nail biting now!,the product worked! In a week the nails had started growing again n my daughter is very happy she also doesnt bite or suck her thumb
1,Not effective,"Very ineffective. Has to be applied frequently because it washes off so easily. Application is a mess - have to clean up afterwards. Even when it was on it had no noticeable effect. Compared to other nail biting polishes this hardly has any bad taste at all. For $30, I was very (extremely) disappointed. Will be going back to Malvinia(spell?)"
1,disappointed,I had heard a lot about amazon but i am disappointed because my order has not been delivered despite and the deadline for delivery has passed. I can only hope that they will deliver it as they have already charged my credit card.
1,If you like pink hands........,"where do I start, um lets just say your hands and face will turn pink from the dye on the case. I never would expect that from a cell phone cover, but im just warning everyone dont get this case or any colored case from this company!!"
2,Doesn't remove makeup,"This product does a very poor job of removing makeup. Practically half of the makeup is still on my face after cleansing, i know because i have to use a makeup remover product after using this. I'm now dishing out the money for a more expensive cleanser that removes EVERYTHING! (Origin) I guess we really do get what we pay for.What I like about this product is that it doesn't cause me to break out. (I have combination skin type).I'm not so sure if it helps with getting rid of my acne or helps balance my skin complexion, i haven't seen much results in these departments."
4,Helps fade dark marks from acne while preventing breakouts,I like this cleanser because it helps my acne marks fade and it is gentle. It is a foaming cleanser that dispenses the exact amount you need in just one pump. For serious acne of course I recommend a prescription product such as Retin-A. I am a U.S. born african woman with medium-dark brown skin.
3,Its alright...,The game could use some touching up on all the little mini-games available as well as the English voice acting. In reality this game should only be purchased if its its under $20 like it is now.
2,"Nice (For a While), Then useless...","This product worked well for a while then about 1 year after I owned it, everything went haywire. First the unit kept saying the battery was dead, I'd take the battery out and replace with a new one and a few days later it would read dead again. I'd check the batteries with a tester and they were perfect. Then the unit would reset itself right after I set the parameters. Then the memory would read ""full"" right after I downloaded the data. I think you get the picture. I sent it back with the $5.00 check and it cost me $5.00 to send it. This is 1/3 of the cost of the unit. I'm still waiting to get it back. I guess you could buy a cheaper pedometer and consider it disposable when it breaks. This unit is nice when it works but Mine stopped working. You'll have to make up your own mind because I'm still on the fence about this pedometer. I'm beginning to think everything made in China is disposable."
1,Don't order this,"Okay, this worked great. I would have left a 5 star rating, until it died after only six weeks. And when I tried to return it, I found out from the Omron company that I needed the original packaging (who really keeps that?) and proof of purchase - Amazon is not enough. I need a receipt. Bad product, worse customer service. Ugh."
1,Product doesnt work. Poor customer service.,"Product arrived defective, would not download data.Customer service dept very slow at answering questions. They are based in the central region and only work 8:30am to 4:30pm. No response after 3 days from receiving my request for help.I will return this product.Very disappointing to have such a poor service from this company."
3,Great Pedometer but just stopped working,"I loved this pedometer when I first bought it. However, after using it for 9 months I thought the battery was dead because it just stopped counting steps. I changed the battery, but that was not the problem. Now it makes a great ""watch"" with the clock since the battery was fine. I take the battery out and press the reset button and it records the steps that I make until I stop. Then it does not start again --- pretty useless now! I am debating on purchasing another one it is too bad they didn't just sell the pedometer without the software since that is fine."
2,Serious design flaw,"From the first day that I used this unit, I could not keep it from falling out of the manufacturer provided belt clip. The unit does not ""click"" into place...it basically just sits there in the clip...my first day out with it, it fell out of the clip and I to go back, retracing my steps to find it in the grass...when it doesn't fall out of the clip, the clip and unit fall off whatever I try to clip it to...I have tried my belt, tried my pants pocket, tried the waist of my jeans with no belt...every time I used it, it fell off...I never used it for running...just walking...and it still fell off...the design is flawed and I would not recommend this to anyone until the design is changed."
2,not powering off,The book says that after 5 minutes of inactivity the unit will power down until a button is pushed. The thing has not shut down once unless I pull the battery or use the reset button on back. I guess Ill have to send it back. I dont even want something that I have to return.
2,The gadget fails to recognize new batteries as new anymore,"The pedometer display does everything I expect it to. Unfortunately, the pedometer has some peculiar flaw that doesn't recognize any new battery as being new. It did for the first 9 months, but then the battery low light started flashing so I put in a brand new battery. Immediately the Battery Low light started flashing, even though the battery was brand new. It kept flashing like that for four months and then stopped working completely. I put another brand new battery in. Same thing happened. I have tested all the batteries the pedometer ""thinks"" aren't working and they work fine in other gadgets - a digital phone, my electronic kitchen scale.The batteries are also supposed to be good for at least a year. Apparently this is some defect with Omron because I have read other people have the same problem.I will not be buying from the company again."
5,"Super, duper exercise helper!","This is my fifth Omron pedometer. Why do I replace the old one? Only because I lose them (victim of senioritis) One of these days I'll find the other 4 - but my newest ""Go Smart"" with ability to track my progress on my computer is the best! Easy to pop in my pocket and easy to read. Tells me all I want to know about my daily walks (and, in addition, all the steps I take during the day)."
3,Be aware Setup Weight only goes to 300lbs as high???,Was thinking this was a 5 star item but only allows weight for all calcs and stats to top setup number of 300 lbs? Come one Omron us big guys are far from 300 lbs.
4,Easy to use,Problem with shipping. Original item never arrived. Amazon did a fantastic job correcting the problem. The Omron is easy to set up and easy to use. The belt clip is not very secure but connecting the included strap to a belt or belt loop eliminates fear of loss.
2,pedometer,i had an omron pedometer before and lost it in a fire but this time this one arrived not workingomron is working with me to get it fixed but i have not had a pedometer for 3 weeks now
1,"I""m getting ready to return the pedometer for the second time","The pedometer is great - when it works. The reports are great and the upload of information is very simple. But that's the best that I can say right now. I thought it was a fluke when the pedometer stopped working the first time after about 6 weeks. There was no warning, the pedometer had not been abused or dropped and it simply quit working. Replaced the battery - nothing. Sent it back to the company for a replacement which came after 2 weeks.That one lasted for 4 weeks. It was working fine in the morning and after coming back from a 10 mile hike, the pedometer display was blank. No flashing display to warn me that the battery was going to die. It simply stopped working and I lost about 3 weeks of data. I'm not impressed with the lack of durability of the unit and am very disappointed. I've only had this since June! Omron - what's the deal?"
5,Easy to use pedometer,The Omron HJ-720ITC Pocket pedometer is easy to use. The software is nice as it gives you a continous view of your progress.
3,Omron Pedometer HJ-720ITC,"I am giving this product 3 stars because the battery lasted about 4 months and it worked well. I started using it in April and by the middle of August the pedometer was dead. Several reviews mentioned that this pedometer would not work when replacing the battery, after a year or so. I ordered it thinking it would probably last a year. I am not planning to spend money or time replacing the battery. I didn't use the software, so I can't comment on that (no time). I had the option of getting it through Costco, but chose Amazon because of the $5.00 difference. I have not contacted Amazon about this issue, but I know Costco would have solved this problem by now."
5,I L-O-V-E love this pedometer!,"This pedometer was sooooo worth the money! I was going to go with the more stripped down version, but with Amazon free shipping, there was barely a difference in price, so I went for the souped up model. I am enjoying the ""hour by hour"" breakdown of activity far more than I anticipated because it has highlighted how little I move when I am at work. I also really appreciate that the pedometer stores activity by day and, therefore, resets to zero at midnight.The pedometer is quite accurate and I appreciate being able to keep it in my pocket rather than clipped to my belt (unless I'm wearing something without pockets). In either case, I also like the very sturdy and secure ""safety leash"" to safeguard my investment. I haven't lost it yet!"
4,Great product!,I love this pedometer. It seems to be very accurate. It is a little bit too big but the great functions supercede this con.
3,ok choice,"software is tedious to finnd. downside is if you need to use it twice in a day, make a note of what you did in the first session . this item resets automaticaly at midnight"
4,Accurate,"The product is easy to use and is accurate.I like being able to download the information ontothe computer, another plus."
2,Good pedoemeter but Software PC only????,This is a good pedometer and I do like it. It aggravates me to no end that companies cannot supply Mac compatible software. Will not even run on a virtual machine on Windows.5 stars for the pedometer zero stars for the software and the software engineers who cannot write software.
4,Extremely Useful Tool,"So very happy with this item contrary to other reviewers (I've owned this pedometer since March'09) no software problems on my windows based pc, never lost with belt clip & safety strap. Amazingly (to me anyways) it differentiates between aerobic exercise or just plain walking. If on the elliptical at home just drop in my shorts pocket works anyway it sits in pocket. Love that memory saves for so long, I don't have to plug in every day to upload data. Also great to show my doctor my progress on software print upswas a borderline candidate for high blood pressure medication. My 3 year old got hold of it last month and tried to introduce it to SpongeBob in the bathtub, so here I am ordering a new one. Good luck & stay fit and if you're not this will help but you must be consistent :)only 4 stars due to my spoiled wishes like a light up screen or even a blood pressure monitor or wireless hookup to computer I know spoiled."
5,Happy customer,"I am very happy with this product. Took me a moment to figure it out, but once I did, I was off and running - literally. I like the volume of info provided; total miles, calories burned, aerobic steps, and excursion time. What makes it worth its weight, is the database tracking software included with the device. It is Windows compatible (only) though, so be careful if you operate a MAC, UNIX or other platform. I have both Windows and MAC and would have preferred to load it on my MAC, but a palatable consolation for the overall value. Good merchant service, too, in that the Omron Pedometer arrived on time and in excellent condition."
5,Omron Pedometer has excellent features and is accurate,"I really like my Omron pedomemter. If you want a pedometer that's accurate and has some great features, then the Omron HJ-720ITC is for you. If you ever had a cheap pedometer, you know it registers false steps - like when you're riding in a car etc. Those cheap pedometers are toys compared to this Omron. The Omron stores your steps for 42 days and lets you download the data to your computer and save and print the results. You can scroll through and display your results for the last 7 days. The Omron keeps track of aerobic steps, which are counted after it determines you have been walking for 10 minutes. The pedometer resets itself to zero at midnight, no pushing reset buttons like other pedometers. This unit is very well designed and I highly recommend it. Several people at work are getting these and this has caused us all to walk more in a friendly sort of competition."
4,omron pedometer,This pedometer is excellent. It seems to overcount the steps most of the time but in general is a good guide to one's exercise program. It simply multiplies the number of steps by the step length which you enter into the device. It works in the pocket or on the belt---although it seems that it needs to be placed directly over the hip.The software does NOT work on Apple computer.
3,Good pedometer,"I think this pedometer is overpriced, also it doesn't have the timer. But anyway it works fine"
1,Beware,I should have paid more attention to previous reviews about the clip on this pedometer. I had to watch it very carefully as it would come unclipped very easily without even noticing. I lost it within 48 hours. A total waste of money.
5,walk everywhere with this pedometer. Reliable and accurate,"Reliable and accurate. Lost one a month ago. Had it for two years, Immediately replaced it with a new one"
5,Indestructible!,"I have had this since last winter and it has worked flawlessly even after having gone thru the washing machine two seperate times. I just took the battery cover off and hung somewhere to dry. It keeps going, and the count is accurate. I like how I am to track my progress on the computer."
1,Absolutely NO Support - Ripoff in my View,"The Omron device is certainly robust and perfectly acceptable. The software, however, is very poorly written and supported: think Windows 95 to get an idea of how antiquated this software really is. Once you have it installed (and that took considerable time searching the internet for a download site), pray that you do not have a computer glitch as did I. Trying to re-install the software was virtually impossible and finding even a modicum of support for the device proved the same. BEWARE! There are far better SUPPORTED devices on the market than this pedometer.Omron HJ-720ITFFP Pocket Pedometer with Advanced Omron Health Management Software"
4,needs a better clip,You need a strap because the clip on the pedometer is not good enough to keep it on. It comes off all the time. needs to be longer and stronger
2,Software does not work on Vista based PC.,"The Pedometer is excellent. However, if your PC is running the Vista operating system, the supplied software will not run on it. I contacted Omron and they confirmed that the software will not run on Microsoft Vista. I was not able to get any indication of what they intend to do in order to correct this situation, if in fact, they intend to do anything. As a result, if you are a Vista user I would caution buying this unit until Omron's plans for Vista support are known."
5,This is the best pedometer out there,"This is my second Omron pedometer as the first one was attached to me when I went swimming. No, they are not waterproof. This one has a more slim-line feeling than the HJ115 and I do like the fact that it can download the information to my computer directly instead of me having to manually track my steps. I love this product and would and do recommend it to anyone who asks."
1,Software doesn't work on Windows 7 64 bit,"If you plan to use this device to track steps on line, forget it!!!! The Omron software will not run on Windows 7 64 bit -- the help line says that they are ""working on it."" They also suggest Microsoft HealthVault, but it too will not upload data from the pedometer using the HealthVault Connection Center software."
2,Software does not work with Vista,"I think the item works well enough, but part of the reason I bought it was for the accompanying software which is not supported by Vista."
1,completely inadequate belt holder,The belt holder has a very small clasp that's fairly low on the back of the pedometer.I had it for TWO DAYS and today it fell off without my noticing. Maybe whoever finds it will have better luck holding on to it.
1,Dud at least today,Used this for the second time today. When done walking the unit said I had gone a distance of 2.6 miles in an hour. I knew that couldn't be correct so I drove the route and it was actually 4.6 miles. Not much use if it is not accurate.
5,quiet and accurate,"This pedometer is easy to use, makes no noise, and the software is also easy to use. I had been given a pedometer that clicked and it drove me crazy. Also the placement on your body was critical. This pedometer is quiet, slips in your pocket, resets every night, keeps a running log, and comes with easy to use software. I would suggest this to anyone serious about keeping tracking of the walking progress."
4,good pedometer,The pedometer itself works pretty good the software could be a little more user friendly. But overall I would recomend this to others.
5,Omron Pedometer,The go smart Omron Pedometer is the best I've ever owned. You can upload your data to your computer and it does the rest including charts and how many steps were aerobic.I recommend this pedometer for anyone that needs one.
2,"I'm no ""real"" Geek",Too complex to figure out or instructions are poor. Still haven't gotten any use of it. No time to STUDY IT. Guess this is a good lazy Sunday project. But D--- really thought it would be great inspirations for my walks.
2,"Maybe good, but cannot select metric units","I expected that an electronic device such as this would have a metric selection, which is what I need, but quite to my surprise it can only display imperial units. Amazon, why not to include a note on the web site stating that this unit is imperial only?"
3,Omron Pedometer,I purchased this pedometer in February 2010. Until recently it gave me great service. I use it about 5 days weekly to measure my daily fitness walks. For about a month it has begun to malfunction by losing the time which often forces me to reset it and open the battery compartment. I am now shopping for a replacement which I hope will last longer and be more reliable.
3,only lasts about 6 months,I have bought two and they both work fine for about 6 months then for some reason the data stored on the pedomter will not download so it is better not to have this pedometer just go with the one that tells you the information and write it down if you want a record of distance
4,Great Tool,My wife fell in love with this. I bought it as a surprise when her other one was misplaced. It is very user friendly and allows accurate tracking for the exercising buff. The only downfall is that the batter life is very poor so be prepared to replace it two to three times a year. Depending on how often you actually use it that is.
2,Used one sent!,"I purchased this pedometer as a new one, but it was already used/returned by someone else. There was no original box, fingerprints, etc. The product itself is great though."
3,Love to Exercise,The product does all the things that is says it does. It's just too big & bulky. It kept falling off of my waist band.
5,excellent motivation,"The Omron HJ-720 Pocket pedometer is an excellent way to track your daily walking activity. It easily accomodates walkers of all sizes, is compact and accurate. The pedometer works well with the accompanying clip, on your belt, or in your pocket. It even works in a briefcase or purse. The pedometer sets easily, tracking steps, aerobic steps, calories, and mileage. It also links to a nifty computer program which allows you to set daily, weekly and monthly goals and tracks your progress towards those goals. The program also works well with Omron BP monitors. The buttons are easy to use, the functions logical and the readout is clearly legible. I find myself checking how far I have walked periodically throughout the day and I am usually motivated to get up and walk some more!"
5,Omron pedometer,"Very easy to program and use. It resets at midnight each night, which is a feature I really like, and I can scroll back to see results of previous days. I wish it were slimmer when it's in the holder, but overall its value is greater than the cost!"
4,Great pedometer - good value,I used to have a flip open belt-clip pedometer and found it often fell off. The fact that this one can work in your pocket is excellent (and it's a reasonable size and smooth edges). Just be careful not to fidgit with it in your pocket or your are artificially increasing your step count! The clip also holds it securely if your outfit doesn't have pockets.Software is fairly intuitive and it's nice to see the overall trends and be able to export the info.
5,Great product,I love everything about this pedometer. I love how it re-sets itself at midnight and remembers the steps for a week. I use the software to graph my progress and it keeps me motivated to add more steps throughout the day.
1,Very frustrating,"I love this product, but it keeps failing on me. It stopped uploading to my computer. I sent it back and they sent me a new one and charged me $5. After a few months, that one stopped uploading. After a few more months, it totally stopped measuring steps. I would buy another one if they would fix the problem."
4,Omron pedometer,"Like this one a lot. It works very accurately. Only thing I wish the belt clip would attach lower on the belt and not hit my belly when I walk!Update: have found out you can clip it on your belt upside down, that way it avoids my belly, but it still works fine."
3,definitely 60s,"This 2-albums-on-1-cd package is unlike the the Varese compilation of her 1950s hits, the only other Caterina Valente music I am familiar with.The songs and the recording style are very different for these mid-60's albums.The recordings are mostly stereo, compared with the 1950s, and the songs are very 'trendy' covers, particularly on the first album on the cd. It could have been called ""All the hits of 65"", and sounds like a Claudine Longet album, light and airy. I liked a few of the covers, but in most cases, the original is a far better record.The second album on the cd has better songs and production.However, the engineer who was responsible for pairing the two albums on a single cd should have boosted the volume a bit for the second album, as it is at a distinctly lower volume than the first one, resulting in the cd seeming to drop in volume a bit after track 13."
2,Dull & Uninteresting,"Marcia Gay Harden is a very good actress but this film CRUSHES those expectations. The film was kinda confusing and dull,after the first 5 to 10 minutes the film kinda went south. Very dull movie and the acting was good it just didn't mix up good enough."
1,Revisionist history WHAT LIES.,"It is a sad situation that PBS and the History channel are the the backward, America hating liberal organizations they are.I have thrown this in the trash, it is so much biased liberal drivel I could not even finish watching it.Pure junk."
4,New Light on an Old Story,"Most Americans know the story of the Pilgrims and Mayflower...or do they? The History Channel has done a great job here, showing us that there is more to the story than we'd been taught. For example, who knew that many of the Pilgrims had actually moved to the Netherlands for an extended period (12 years or so) before deciding to try their luck in the New World? Or that there were actually two ships (the other being called The Speedwell), but the 2nd one was left behind because it was deemed un-seaworthy? Or that the Pilgrims landed first, not at Plymouth, but on Cape Cod, only to be driven off by the Native Americans there? These facts and many others are revealed in this interesting film.Four stars. A bit long (almost 140 minutes) but I found it worth the time!"
3,A Romance not a Mystery?,"I have read MHC books for years, but this was more like a romance than a mystery, and the main character really bugged me. She seemed so dumb. She didn't hire a PI until the end to help find out what happened, she didn't pursue the clues herself or try to ""dig up"" (pun intended) any new ones, all she did is get preggers. After one character did something criminal to her, she invited her over for dinner and made nice. Well, I guess it could have been like those old mysteries where they got the suspects all together at dinner...Too mushy, not enough action."
2,"Murder, She Wrote?","This book was suspenseful enough to keep me reading it. I've never read any MHC books before, so I'm not sure if they're written the same. The story was good, but the writing was off. It felt like she switched perspective too often (never quite sure who ""I"" is, for example.)"
2,Her worst book to date,"I'm sorry, too, but this book reads as if her daughter wrote it. I like her older books with 2 or 3 threads running concurrently and then climaxing into a series of twists. This is more like you know who is the main suspect and obviously it is someone else. The characters aren't great, so I really don't care who the murderer is. Not a page turner!"
5,excellent,"Excellent first Bible for little ones. It is easily understood by children of all ages, with entertaining pictures for children to look at when they hear the stories. This Bible is a perfect baptism or baby gift."
3,"good but needed an editor, baadddd...","the content was very profound and enlightening but she needs to work on her writing skills. some of her sentences could have been arranged better, which made it a little hard to read."
2,Comfort shoe not comfortable!,"My high hopes for this shoe were dashed the minute I had it on. Of course - it would be too long.Then, I noticed it did not feel all that comfortable.The ""thong"" part is very hard, not rounded for comfort, and this hardness can be FELT through the very thin ""fur""! The edge that goes over the instep is also very tight and hard-edged. House slippers should be comfortable - at every level! The cushioning is also less supportive than I thought it'd be. If your floors are hard, and you need to STAND in them for a while (i.e.: working in the kitchen), these may not be the shoes for you either.I bought the Acorn Eco slipper, and it is a good fit. I needed a ""thong"" style- for while the weather is still warm.I am returning this ""Spa"" slipper."
3,Average,"I bought these slippers because I wanted a thicker style and this style had great reviews. I wear a size 9 or 9.5 in shoes so I ordered the large (8-9) which was the correct size. However, the top of the slipper is tight and not very comfortable. I have worn them around the house for a couple of days hoping they will stretch, but I don't think that will happen. Thong slippers are a nice idea- you would think your feet won't get as hot as they might in ballet or clog types, but it doesn't really make a difference. Overall, I would recommend trying another style and/or brand. I usually wear isotoner ballet slippers and they are always comfortable."
2,Didn't fit me well...uncomfortable,"I found these slippers to be small on me, therefore, they were uncomfortable.I normally wear a 7.5M or an 8M. Most reviewers stated these slippers run large, so I ordered the 6.5 - 7.5 (M). When I put them on, the length of the shoes was more than long enough, but the band that goes over the top of my foot was way too tight. It was painful to walk and I didn't know if the material would stretch or not, so I returned them. My foot is not especially wide, so I am not sure why these didn't work for me. I definitely think the next size up would have been too long (in the length)."
5,Spa thongs were a big hit for Christmas,I gave these spa thongs to my daughter for Christmas (she put them on her Amazon Wish List) and she has been thrilled with them. She says they are extremely comfortable--like walking on marshmallows! The reviews on this item were very helpful in making my selection. Hope mine helps as well. A very good buy!
1,Strong odor of perfume,"These slippers are great, except if you have sensitivity to perfumes as I do. These slippers still have a strong odor of perfume even after being put through the washing machine and dryer two times and left out on my deck for days in the rain and in the sun. So thumbs down."
4,Acorn womens new spa thong,"So far I really like them. The cushioning to keep my feet from walking on hard tile floors in my home is what I was looking for, and thisshoe feels very comfortable and also soft! The shoe seems to be made with quality."
2,Experimental Rock?!,"These guys are not bad, but innovative or experimental they are not. Just because there are quirky keyboards and electronic beats mixed with rock n roll elements doesn't mean its experimental. Pink Floyd was experimental. The Flaming Lips are experimental. Mute Math is pop rock. There are definitely some interesting elements in the music, like the vocal melodies (a little Stingish), but this is not worth the incredible praise it has received. I wouldn't buy it. I'd buy a few songs."
1,New formula sucks,"New formula is terrible. I know it sounds like an ad, but search for Hickox Styling Creme....it is almost exactly the same as the old Bumble & Bumble formula."
1,Not the orginal product from amazon,"I got this product recently for my wife from amazon and here is her review of the product- "" This product from amazon is entirely different from the ones I get from my salon. The concentration of the creme is much lesser and it does not do any magic to my hair. Rather I feel the hair do looks very ordinary after applying this creme. I have been using this product more than 2 years now and this is the first time I ordered from amazon and I regret it now. I am going to go ahead and get the original one from my stylist even though they are few dollars more. I recommend this product, but not from amazon. Buy it from our local salon."""
1,Not the same product formula ordering thru Amazon,"Normally if I were rating this product, it gets 5 stars without hesitation. For some reason, what I got thru Amazon was clearly not the same stuff, even though the packaging was identical. The consistency of the product was different, and it also felt very different on my hair - not at all even remotely similar to what I've experienced when buying it from either my hair stylist or from Target. I can't even say it under-performed, rather, it didn't perform at all. I don't know what happened here, maybe it was stored at a weird temperature and it made the contents go bad, or it was a bogus batch... all I know is, I won't be ordering it thru Amazon again... In this case, it's worth it to spend a few extra bucks to know you're getting the legitimate product."
4,Back to the old....,My stylist told me about the formulation change after I complained that it seemed different. A few months later she said they changed it back after getting slammed with complaints. I bought a new bottle and it definitely seems like the old formula. Also consider their new styling gel.
1,Disappointed!,"This is the first time I've used B&B Styling Creme, so I'm not a disgruntled user of the previous formula. I've been trying to find a product to replace the wonderful but discontinued Matrix Quality Control, and hoped this was it. My hair is fine and thin, and my plan was to create some volume and manageability with this product. What I ended up with was sticky hair which was almost impossible to comb through, felt stiff and looked dried-out, yet at the same time was FULL of unmanageable static. It was so bad I had to wash it out of my hair and start over with some of the last little bit of Quality Control I have. I won't give up my search, but this one is definitely not going to work for me."
1,The most incredible styling aid I've ever used,"It gets one star here for being priced at 150% of retail and using a (stolen?) picture of packaging that was changed over 2 years ago.You'd think that if they're getting so much for the product, they could afford to take some pictures.BOOOOOOOOO"
4,Helps with blowdryin,I like this product because my hair seems easier to manage when blowdrying.The stylist used it at the salon and I thought I'd try it.
1,Disappointing!,"We bought this DVD, after we purchesed Sesame Beginnings: Beginning Together. The first Dvd is really good - 5 stars. But this Dvd is bad. The songs are not good as at the first dvd and my 16 month old doesn` t like it at all."
4,baby loves it!,"I bought this dvd because it was also in spanish and my baby only watches it in spanish. She is 6 months old and likes watching the fluffy figures, she smiles and dances with them. I don't give it 5 stars because although they use good spanish the names of the characters remain in english eventhough they have their own name in spanish."
2,boring,"My daughter didn't care much about it, either, she is 20 months old. She was really excited to watch it, but lost interest quickly into the first song. I found it annoying, all the squaky voices, too much fuzz and not fun."
2,No beautiful music,"I thought this would be the perfect DVD for my son's 1st birthday party ""band of babies"" to play along to. However, half of the DVD is spent with talking about making music with children, not actually making music. 35% of the DVD was music, the other 15% was fluff. I was not pleased at all. There are more musically fun moments on Play with me Sesame. Don't waste your money. This DVD is only worth $5 tops."
2,Good for young toddlers- not mine,"I bought this DVD after having read the glowing reviews for it on Amazon. I am sorry to say that I ended up watching more of it than my toddler did, and even I was not that impressed. I happen to LIKE the Baby Einsten DVDs, and my daughter ADORES them- especially the Baby Da Vinci. She is 20 months old and has liked them all since she was an infant. This DVD felt stilted, too scripted and slow to me. She didn't watch it either. I would recommend most of the Baby Einsten DVDs over this at any time."
2,title sounds better than bok!,"i love Rue Mcclanahan and the charater she palyed on Golden Girls. this was the first book i purchased for my Kindle. the book starts off very boring, and she mentions all sorts of relatives, friends, boyfriends throuout the book. after a while, you forget who they are. only a couple of funny stories, mostly very boring. you would do better to get this at the library, for free, or a yard sale for very little money. it wasn't worth the price i paid. very dissapointed in this book."
2,Light hearted reading,I love Rue McClanahan and couldn't wait to get her book. It was a fun read and I did enjoy it but don't look for too much depth.
1,look closley,"do not buy this dvd if you are looking at picture on box or going by reviews,box reads vol.2 what you really get is vol.1.The reviews are for vol.2.sure it was only $3.00,but i wanted vol.2 (which is not available anywhere).buyer beware."
3,Review of Kriwaczek's 'Search',"Kriwaczek does his best to entertain the reader, but it simple isn't enough. This is a poorly organized travel novel that does little more than lightly introduce Zoroastrianism. The work is neither thorough-going nor engrossing. The prose fails to pull the reader forward and listen closely. The idea is here, but the execution was sub-par."
2,i was disappointed,"I am a big fan of the show and I am a clean freak. I brought the book in hopes to capture all the good remedies that the show displays. It doesn't. It explains the importance of being clean and the way to go about cleaning, but not how. It tells you to clean a little everyday and don't let it become overwhelming to the point where you don't know where to start. It explains the essentials of cleaning. (what kind of rags, mops and dusters you should have)Not a good buy. I was very disappointed and don't recommend it. buy a ""how to"" book. You will get more out of it."
4,Does what I hoped for,I really like the nightlight. It helps when trying to find things in the night when you don't want to turn on any lights. I luminates just enough. I use it in my bathroom which helps when my grandchildren are over so they may see what they are doing without waking anyone else up. I did not rate this perfect because I would rather have it a sensor light but the on off switch is close to perfect.
3,a mixed potpourri,"Michael Hemmingson has collected in this volume 39 courtroom/legal stories not only by the accomplished masters but also from up-&-coming writers. Featured are writings of Gardner, Turow, Grisham, Andrew Vachss, Francis M. Nevins. Jr., the accomplished masters of the genre & also exciting legal stories from non-legal authors like Jeremy Russell & John Lutz.The Mammoth Book, true to its name is mammoth in content, but a trifle disappointing as acknowledged superstars of the genre like Steve Martini, Richard North Patterson & Lisa Scottoline, have been left out.I must say that the stories show a remarkable variety; from the interesting Perry Mason The Case of the Crying Swallow to the amusing Mike Wiecek's The New Lawyer, & from the intriguing Francis M. Nevins's Loren Mensing mystery Night of the Silken Snow to the satirical My Bonnie Lies by Ted Hertel Jr.Though not a great collection, it is a good anthology worth its name - a potpourri."
1,"Metaphore Heavy, stock footage","This show touts its nature prowess like a lion strutting on the African plain, but in reality is filled with less information than a drunks' witticisms. Filled with more similes than the genetic structure of identical twins, the watcher is inundated with long-winded phrases like a bad surfer is with waves. The scenes change quicker than a shy high-schooler in a locker room, or the promises of your local politician. With more flashing than a disco ball, the viewer becomes glad they do not suffer from epilepsy, unless they do."
1,Bad Graphics and Video,"I love national geographic, but this DVD was very disappointing. Part of it looked like a powerpoint presentaion with the same video animations repeating itself through the episodes. Not worth the money."
3,A little over dramatic...,"Honestly, I gave this program a three star rating because I happen to like the earth. Listening to the narrator reminded me of 9th grade speech class and term papers: an excuse to link cliche upon cliche. I'm not easily impressed by big words or dramatic tone of voice either; maybe the constant reference to belching, burping and indigestion didn't coincided with my dinner, but I say, ""let the earth speak for itself."""
2,is this for real?,"The narration sounds like they're trying to turn a documentary into a Jr. High level action movie. Got about 3min in, and gave up when I learned that our planet has indigestion, is belching, spitting & passing gas ;) Sorry"
1,Product not the same as what is sold in stores,"I have been using Royall Mandarin Orange for more than two years. It is by far my favorite after shave. The bottle that I had ordered from amazon had a faulty safety seal and smells watered down. I you find this after shave product in a store, try it out. It is great if you like citrus."
5,Absolutely the best live DVD I've ever seen,"Pain of Salvation isn't exactly a household name, so I figured the quality of this DVD may suffer a bit from budget limitations. I was SO wrong. The production is beautiful. The performance is flawless. And they somehow produce a sense of intimicy that I've never seen before. They prove every inch of their musicianship is for real. Daniel's pipes are just as good live as in studio. He gets to indulge his theatrical side. And there's even a bit of humor with everyone doning their shades for Dea Pecuniae. The only bad thing I can say about this DVD is it may be the only opportunity many of us will ever get to see POS live. Thought I've certainly got my fingers crossed."
3,Wack'em hard,"These require a firm hit to install. Freezing helps but grab a nice solid piece of wood then line them up straight as you can then hit'em square and hard. If you are dainty with them, plan on spending some time getting them to seat. China machining has some improvements needed."
1,Poor quality and Missing episodes,"X-Files ""The Complete Second Season"" is INCOMPLETE! They list the episodes but some episodes listed are missing from the disc!I want to return it for a refund!"
4,Die hand die,Pretty creepy episode with some interesting themes. The characters were all pretty spooky in this one. I was dumbfounded by the ending thou; which seemed like such a silly way to finish it with no actual thought or effort behind it. Quite dissatisfying and I am still quite confused by how or why it played out the way it did.
2,Excelsius Dei,"Good idea and it was interesting seeing Scully as the doubter in this episode. Despite this, it still had the biggest cop-out random/silly ending I have ever seen so far in the X-Files. Oh well."
5,Great collection,"I got ""hooked"" on the X-files when they first aired. I really thought the series was well written and very entertaining. I don't think I missed any of the the first three seasons episodes and was very glad to now have season two to rewatch any time I choose."
1,I can't believe it ! It's only in English !,"What I said: I can't believe it. The first complete season was published with Spanish subtitles (and I bought that pack because of I speak Spanish) but now they have produced the second season only in English !!! THIS IS NOT COHERENT.I don't know what's happening with the DVD editors. They often make DVD boxes with not the same language. This is a common trouble.The first pack was very nice and I'm sure that the second pack is nice too, but it's only for English speakers. What a pity."
4,"Pretty good, but not the best SW album","Highlights include ""Nothing"", ""Lies"", ""Control"", and ""Throw"". I don't really like how on some of the songs, such as ""Ungod"" and ""Lies"", that there are periods of nearly or over a minute of tuneless noises, but i guess that's not uncommon on an industrial rock album. It's also scary how much this album sounds like NIN's PRETTY HATE MACHINE, but that's not really a bad thing, considering that's a good album. Overall, the album's good, and would definetly not be a waste of money for any SW fan."
2,Let's try it again,"I gotta be honest, I love Stabbing westward but I dont like this album. I would advise against buying it. Why? Because you need to get Wither,Blister,Peel..instead. It sounds to me as if they recorded Ungod, then decided to rewrite the songs all over and came up with Wither. And Wither rules.I'm not slamming them cause this was their first album and those arent always the smashing sucess.But they were smart.Just did it over and came out with a hit."
2,Solid - not high enough,"A solid product. Unfortunately, the rise isn't enough for me to tow and use the top for a bike rack or hitch hauler."
2,A good factual account but not the spirit ...,"Samuel Adams: Radical Puritan recounts the major events in it's subject's life, but doesn't leave you with a feeling about the essence of the man. Sam Adams does not speak for himself enough via quotes from his own writings. The coverage of the Sons of Liberty is reduced to 13 superficial pages. It does provide a glimpse of an old revolutionary not changing with the times after the war has been won. But it is not the full color portrait of a life like that Van Doren has provided for Benjamin Franklin."
5,Great for when washing face or putting on makeup.,"I've been looking all over for something that's adjustable for when I wash my face and do my makeup. I have purchased just regular stretch, and it's either too tight on my head or not wide enough. This was perfect, love the material and adjustable velcro...and it's wide enough to cover my hair for when I wash my face."
4,Maybe my heads too big,I like for the band to sit just above my hairline and cover my ears but by the time I am finished washing my face the band has slipped back and my hair next to my ears is exposed and wet.
5,Really Nice,I like this product. I put it on my tractor. It seems to be built much better that those available from the local chain auto-parts stores and at a reasonable price.
4,"Beautiful, well explained book!","The explanations are clear and the ideas are great, but there are few photos that show the step-by-step of the confections. It is a pity!"
3,Not enough photos...,"The book is OK, the recipes seem to be good (I haven't tried any yet), but there's a lack of photographs...I think they are very important in cookbooks!!"
3,Classified as juvenile literature,"As an avid student of, and experimenter in, recorded sound, and particularly in the historical aspects, I anticipated learning something new from this book. At first I was shocked at the glaring errors and omissions in this thin volume, but discovered on the fly leaf that this is classified as ""Juvenile Literature."" That explained it. I wish that fact had been made clear in Amazon's summary of this volume."
4,True horror (not just blood and guts) fans will love this!,"Even if you don't like Kurt Russell, he is great in this film, and the other cast members and (mainly) the story will keep you on the edge of your seet. Truly suspenseful (even I was surprised). A roller coaster, snowy ride. Definitely worth the rent (or buy)if you like horror, drama, suspense, action or any combo of the above. Great date flick."
4,Much-needed perspective,"Creative and soulful, Runaway Slave provides a refreshing new perspective on slavery. These are not your expected political talking points stoking the race industry as a means to a political end. It's done from the perspective of a deeply spiritual man who searches his soul to integrate the spiritual with the political from his individual perspective on American history. He comes up with his own answers, rather than following what today's politicized media tells him he ought to think. There is no knee-jerk labeling of the Tea Party, for example. Rather, he keeps a thoughtful, open mind to all sides of the story. One needn't agree with everything to feel the resonance. Runaway Slave is chock-full of erudite black American sources with many good interviews and angles. It's a must for any open-minded, inclusive study of American history. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that it's a bit long and could stand some editing here and there. Otherwise, it'd be a solid five."
4,Just Right,"Royall Spyce is a reliable fragrance that always performs well from batch to batch. I think it is ""just right"" with good spicy fragrance, but not ""too much"". At Orvis they sell 4 ounces for $49.99. Get it at Amazon for $31.29 for 8 ounces!!"
1,Not Peter Cushing Movies,"I bought this set to see Peter Cushing.Peter Cushing does not star in these movies-even though one of them says""Starring""-two of them he hardly does much at all-This is deceptive packaging-Not great movies-skip it-"
2,YIKES!,"I gotta tell you, anyone who screams at this DVD needs their head examined.The stories, while entertaining, are so juvenile that I felt cheated after reading the reviews before buying it.I have to wonder if the reviews are for real.It's like a cross between Twilight Zone and some of the old, predictable Vincent Price movies.If you are a collector of the macabre you might like it for the sake of viewing old movies. However, scary? It isn't."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"Having attended five universities,I am well familier with this stereotypical airhead teacher who can't draw a straight line.I feel sorry for his students!! I read half the book and threw itin the garbage with the hope of saving someone else from reading it"
1,not much value here,"I found this small book disappointing at best.Overly large portions of this book are devoted to the personal recollections of the author which do so little to enhance or provide any meaningful perspective on the rest of the book that one suspects they were added only to fill out sufficient length to permit the book to be sold as a book rather than an article. If you are looking to understand anything about why the south took the course it did in the time period leading up to the civil war or subsequently, I expect almost any other book will provide more bang for the buck."
2,Not Great,"This is a really poor E and E. I find most of E and Es really helpful, but I'm no better off owning this one than I was without it. The brief explanations of the topics at the beginning of each chapter do not suffice. Furthermore the questions are fairly straightforward and extremely leading, but this can be a problem with most E and E's. If you are buying this just to get the hypos then by all means go right ahead, but do not think that you are going to learn sales from reading this book. You'd be better served spending your time on your Course Outline."
5,A candid look at a historic decade,Harris Wofford brings the reader to some of the key moments in one of the nation's most tumultuous decades. His stories are genuine because he was there -- a key advisor to John and Robert Kennedy and to Martin Luther King.
2,An Heartbreaking End,"Perhaps my expectations were too high, or perhaps it's the feeling you get when one day you realize that you've fallen out of love -- but this album made me very sad to listen to, it didn't move me at all as her earlier albums had done. The Precious One was, after all, flesh and blood. And either out of ideas or out of her depth considering this was produced by Ms. Bush. ""The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same / you're not to blame."""
3,Not a replacement,"If you are insalling this shore connection in a new installation application; it might work. I purchased this to replace my existing cable scuttle on my Jayco travel trailer. This connector housing is too small to replace the existing scuttle, so I'm going to have to drill a new hole and leave the existing scuttle installed. Also, the strain relief clamp on the housing of this connector is designed for Romex cable. Being a 30Amp connector, you should be using 10 AWG cable. There is not enough space in the back of the housing to accomdate manipulation of the 10 AWG cable once the connector is wired because it wires in the rear of the connector. If you use an SJ or SO or SOW type cable, you'll have to install your own strain relief through the rear of the housing. Not what is expected. They should be more specific with the specifications on this item."
1,dimensions ?,I would have already sent for this 30 Amp 125v standard RV inlet if they would give the dimensions and I knew it would cover the existing opening .
3,A fair attempt,"This book was enjoyable, but not all it could be. On the plus side, Huff's take on vampires -- as essentially bestial and tending toward amoral at heart, but capable of good and generally not killers -- was well done and original. Henry, the vampire, was the best character.On the other hand, the interplay between the heroine detective and her ex-partner was stilted hard-boiled ""wisecracking"" pretty much at its worst. And Huff seems to have no sensitivity toward the psycho loser demon-raiser who is her villain, while oozing affection for her golden-girl-gone-half-blind star detective with the great body. In other words, Huff's understanding of character seems simplistic.But, the plot was rip-roaring, and kept me turning the pages. It was original and tightly written, with nary a plothole in sight. If the author could work on adding more depth, as opposed to phony-sounding personality clashes, to her characters, she would be a truly fine novelist."
3,"Love the book, hate the typos (kindle)","I recently downloaded ""Blood Price"" to my Kindle touch to re-read, since Tanya Huff's books always make me feel better about life. Her strong female leads are always awesome and relatable, and amongst the fluff and wit that make the book such a fun, easy read are a sentence or two that evoke amazing sense of place or person. Not to mention she is hilarious.Unfortunately, as soon as I started reading, the book quite quickly became a quagmire of blatant typos. Now don't get me wrong, I am fine with the occasional typo, but there was at least one mistake per five pages. Sometimes it was five mistakes per one page. I diligently reported most of the more horrific errors, but eventually gave up and asked for my money back. The rather unhelpful customer support person I talked to said they would send it up to quality control, so hopefully they can fix some of this.I guess I will just have to read my hard copy...sigh."
4,Good story,Highly recommend this book. I do not recommend the proofreader. The ebook is full of typos. Distracting at times.RM
2,no response,Well I tried to e-mail this place that sent it before my return day is up and i still havent heard from them yet!!The Collector's Encyclopedia of Homer Laughlin China: Reference and Value Guide
1,Had trouble with this toast in two countries,"We first bought this toaster at a local kitchen store in New Zealand. We had it for a couple of weeks and liked it so much that I decided I would buy one for my elderly mother who lives in Arizona. Before she even received hers, ours had broken and wouldn't clip over to the side so that the toast wouldn't go down. When she received hers and opened it for her Christmas present, hers wouldn't clip down either so the heating was not activated. I would not recommend purchasing this based on our experience."
3,"Nice features, poor performance","This toaster is beautiful on your counter, has great features but didn't even come close to an evenly browned piece of bread....at least two to three shades difference on a small piece of toast. I gave up after three weeks and returned it."
1,Horrible quality. Don't bother!!!!!,This book went out of print for one reason only-- because it's garbage. Looks like it was made on a home computer. Most of the photos look like newspaper print-- just awful! Someone needs to do the lovely Liz Montgomery justice and write a good book. It seems the author started trying to sell them on Ebay after it flopped. The reviews were probably written by her friends. The insane prices on this poor excuse for a biography are a joke. Don't fall for the supposed value. We love you Elizabeth and so happy your movies are finally being released on DVD!Get the A&E biography if you want quality content.
5,"Saw the movie, Read the book",I just saw the movie tonight and thought it was very enjoyable. Critics have been way too harsh. Go see the movie and judge for yourself. Got this book last week and thoroughly enjoyed.
5,OF A TRIBAL NATURE!!!,"""Essential Elements"" is a healthy blend of Afro-rhythms with thumpin' basslines and dancefloor friendly beats sure to impress everyone at your next ""house"" party. If folks don't dig the insatiable, seamless grooves delivered by producers Mateo and Matos, and are just standin' on the wall, I'd kick 'em out the party."
2,Barely worth the bucks,"I must whole-heartedly agree with Fran, ( a real soul mate, it seems) whose well thought out and written review was right on the money. I was a college station DJ in the Bay area for 15+ years and specialized in this music and played all these bands. I loved the cool Swedish and Aussie bands of the 80's, as well as many U.S. bands doing the new psych/garage rawk. If I couldn't get them in for an interview, I'd get them on the phone. Anyway, I would only consider getting this set USED if I really wanted it for just the small portion of good/great stuff on it. These are albums and singles you'd have tough time finding now, or might pay a pretty penny for. The book Alec wrote (and he's extremely knowledgable) would also add some value.B. St. Vitus"
1,Disappointing,The lesson goes to quickly & before you know it Sabrina is ready to do the entire dance. Her voice is annyoing & she doesn't break the steps down slow enough. I've been a hip hop dancer half my life & this wasn't quality. Save your money.
1,Impossible to Follow!!,"I love dance work outs, so I thought this would be a great addition to my collection. However, this DVD was impossible to follow! Save your money."
1,Not good for Jogging,"I purchased this product for a close friend two months before her baby was born. Fortunately she did not wait to assemble it after the baby was born because if she did, she would have been in for a rude awaken.She stated this stroller doesn't turn, it just rolls straight. This is an inconvenience if you have to turn or veer in a certain direction because you would have to stop, move the stroller either left or right, and then gain your momentum back.I felt aweful when my friend stated she had to exchange this stroller for a totally different one."
3,Love the stroller - HATE the infant carrier,My baby is 3 months old and I have loved the system up until now - the car seat BROKE trying to get the seat off of the base - Love the system but I now question the quality
5,love it so far,"My husband and I love how durable it is, and we also love the quality. It is a little big, but it isn't such a cheap stroller that could just fall apart like my last one did. We love it."
2,"If you want accuray, look elsewhere",For color printing I use HP's Officejet Pro 7780 (top of the line?) and thought HP's paper would be a perfect match. Not so. The paper has a yellowish base and all the photographs print way too warm. I was very disappointed and can only use this paper for proofs where color accuracy is of no importance.
1,Misunderstanding Human Nature and the Role of Women,"I have several problems with the content of Colleen Hammond's book.1. She, like Freud, implies that all human interaction is based on sex.2. She encourages the false idea that women should do things in order to make men ""take care"" of them, as if they were children.3. She implies that she knows the preferences of every married man (i.e. old fashioned nightgowns and aprons)."
1,You'll love it . . . if you already agree with her!,"What struck me most about this book is that the author argues from emotion. If a reader is easily swayed by emotional arguments, or is already of the opinion that women should never wear anything but skirts & blouses or dresses (no pants, shorts, swimsuits etc.) then that reader will love this book. If a reader is not easily swayed by emotional arguments and is not already convinced of the morality of the author's dress code, then I seriously doubt that reader will be convinced by this book.The other thing which bothered me is the fact that, on the back cover of the book, the author is marketed as a ""stay-at-home mother"" while at the same time as ""An award-winning writer, radio and television talk show host and speaker"". She can't be a stay-at-home mom and at the same time a radio and TV talk show host and speaker. In my opinion this is a serious fumble which destroys much of the author's credibility."
2,Beginner's manual,Found this very basic. Someone with no introduction to outdoor construction of structures may find it helpful.
4,A Mythago Story,"Alex Bradley is a lost boy, in Ryhope Wood. A primeval wood defending itself against incursions from the outside world.Even when a body is found and buried as Alex, his father takes to the wood with the help of ""experts"" who are exploring and studing it's ""mythago"" effects.But the wood is using Alex's imagined heros & tricksters and giving them a life of their own, who now defend Alex.These myths and archetypes can be heroic or nightmarish but almost all are deadly.Each step the explorers take alters the magical balance within the woods. Ryhope Wood doesn't like change.As an exploration of the subconscious achtypes this is a clever and imaginative book.Well written by Holdstock on a theme that he has mastered and used in other ""Mythago"" novels."
2,Mostly filler,"There is simply not enough material here to justify a book. I got to the point where Comstock died and said, ""That's it?"" This should have been a magazine article at best. The actual mutiny and aftermath take up 50 pages or so. The majority of the book is two types of filler (along with several pointless appendices to get the page count up). The first is an excessively long rundown of the very few facts known about Samuel Comstock's prior life padded with a ton of speculation from the author. The second (and majority of the book) is an account of the two survivors living among the natives. This has some interesting points, but not enough, and is a completely separate and largely unrelated story from the mutiny itself."
2,Rather dissappointing,"The author's speculations were at times annoying.But what I disliked the most about this book wasit incomplete summary of the folks involved.The author wrote a good deal about the twostranded survivors. Yet in the closing of thebook, the fate of one is ommitted. This wasaggravating."
2,Thou Shalt Not Mutiny,"I have read a number of whaling/mutiny/lost at sea books in the last decade or so and was surprised as I trudged through this volume and found that the bits of fact and history were highly peppered with the author's own opinions and interjections. There is a lot of moralizing here, almost sermon like at times, and it completely gets in the way of the story. Heffernan may have been better served writing a novelization of this terrible and bloody event rather than a ""history"" as his histrionics many time take center stage. The book isn't terrible. It gets the facts across. But the best part of the book is actually the appendix that presents the actual journal of George Comstock (the mutineer's younger brother) as well as a few other historical tidbits. The story would have been much better served by a telling of the facts without all of the personal insight. I have purchased a copy of ""Demon of the Waters"" and am looking forward to a more direct approach to this wild story."
4,Really good,"I like it, it was quick and just like I espected. Nice!The Simpsons DUFF BEER Logo Red Shirt"
4,"Lots of ""Joy"" here!","Great collection of Apollo 100's best instrumentals including the ""Joy"" album in it's entirety. I deducted one star because the recording quality should have been better.Still a great cd and blast from the past!"
4,Best of Apollo 100,"Was hoping for better sound quality..... But still brought me back to when I first got the album on my 13th birthday, many moons ago. I I play it allot and think one day my wife will hide it from me!"
3,Cut-and-dry self-protection book,"The techniques presented in this book are simple and deadly. They are meant to be used when one is facing a life and death situation. Many involve holding on to your opponent's head while delivering a potentially fatal blow. Some of these techniques are suited only for attacking the eyes or throat. If I were going on to the battlefield, this book would be all I'd need; however, in the civilian world, there are things that this book does not address, such as awareness and avoidance, and legal considerations. However, it does address different crimes that the reader may come up against, and having the proper mental attitude to deliver these fatal techniques. I'd recomend getting this book as a suplement to a more awareness-based self defense program; these are great techniques, but knowing when to use them is critical."
4,"Techniques which are ""deadly force""","This book contains hard core techniques aimed at winning a street fights and defend in all assaults. As the disclaimer of the book says, all these 12 techniques are considered as ""Deadly Force"" by the law, so you must use them only when your life is seriously threatened.Having said that, they are brutal, effective, easy to learn and to practice.Practicing them will not grant you a trophy in a karate competition, but will give you a tremendous advantage in case you are attacked on the streets.Very useful."
3,OK but not my favorite,My daughter started teething very early and this toy was too large for her mouth. She would hold it in her hand and instead of soothing herself on the chilled wing she would chew on her free hand. This will probably be good for when she gets older but for now I am not a big fan.
2,Not great...,"I bought this cable so that I could play video games on my computer using my monitor as a TV. I know it's possible, because my oldest brother has the exact same cable and did the same thing. After installing everything, it didn't work. I then uninstalled everything, reinstalled it, and now my computer won't recognize the cable at all. Either I didn't uninstall it ""properly,"" or my cable went bad."
5,Nuts for Knots,"Nuts for Knots is a favorit of my African Grey. If it can.t be destroyed, it's just not meant for parrots. This toy is inexpensive and totally destuctable. It goes from being a tight knot to a pom pom in a couple of days! It's ready for the trash before it accumulates dirt.Try it!"
4,some good advice concerning your ex harassing you,"A quick read with some good advice concerning your ex harassing you, hindered/blocked visitation, and continued contact and possible litigation with your ex until the kid(s) are grown."
4,lousy sound quality/great music,"haven't listened to this one in awhile, but it is a good one. the recording quality is not so good as i recall, yet the lousy recording doesn't hold back the power of the music. perhaps many -- if not all -- of these songs could be found on a recording w/better sound quality."
5,VERY nice,"An excellent compilation of mellow mood music from 2 talented DJs Claude Challe and Ravin (of Buddha Bar fame). The first CD is described best as relaxing, calm and smooth, while the second - more upbeat, transient lounging music. With a good mix of Arabic, Hindi and Urdu music, as well as Spanish guitar and other Southern European/African/Latin influences, this collection is definitely sexy and slick."
4,DELUXE,"another amazing release from French DJ Claude Challe (Buddha Bar), in a luxurious package, superb design and excellent taste in music makes this a must. His Budha Bar compilations are also the peak of my collection. Sure must for music lovers"
2,"not enough concept explanation, too much other minor detail","Important are not explained in depth enough. ex; attack objects, Deep inspection. It spends more time explain how to setup a certain thing than why this needs to be done or under what circumstance this need to be done.I thought Juniper own documentation sometimes provide more useful concept than the book."
2,Disappointed,The lamp is small and attractive. However a 3 way bulb which it is designed for will barely fit under the shade support. A CFL 3 way bulb won't fit. After a few months the brass bulb base came apart and won't stay together. The touch on mechanism (which is why I bought this) failed so I had to replace with a regular bulb holder with a switch.Not recommended.
3,Not for everyone,"I love Christmas music. I try to listen to as much Christmas music as I can get my hands on. I purchased this CD after enjoying Placido Domingo singing ""In Pace"" on Kenneth Branagh's HAMLET and the Christmas album with Michael Bolton and Ying Huang. Unfortunately for me, the 3 Tenors Christmas CD is what you might call too much of a good thing. After awhile I was needing to hear a lady's voice accompaniment or perhaps a children's choir. These three men are very talented and very good at what they do, but an entire Christmas album with only them may seem rather monotonous to some listeners."
4,out of print,I bought these cards years ago when there were only 80 in the deck. when I bought my cards they were just pieces of paper that I had to cover with plastic to even use. don't get me wrong I loved the cards and their messages. they must be out of print now because they are so expensive. I didn't pay but about 19.95 if that for the ones I got so I was really disappointed that they were just paper. they were sealed so I couldn't tell. I highly recommend the Angel of light cards by Diana Cooper I got some of them recently and the are good cards. and the meaning of the card is printed right on it. you don't have to look it up
1,3 weighings,"I bought this scale somewhere else and I found it to be accurate on different surfaces, hardwood, tile or carpet. But it ceased to work after three days! the button got stuck in with my attempt to urge it on, they didn't seem well made. when it was workig, managing the settings was difficult. Dissapointed coming from Tayor who I thought had a reputation for accuracy and reliability."
1,Poor,"The quality of these china markers has dropped a lot compared to what they were. I have been using these for over 30 years and this will be the last time I purchase them. My main complaint is the material the wax is made of. They used to be very smooth to use. Now they feel like there is sand in them and have a terrible drag to them. You can even hear them scratching as you use them. Secondly, they do not tear right after you pull the string to expose the new end. It is a pain to try to get all of the old paper off. The diameter of the wax is smaller than my old ones. It might not be much but it is obvious when you look at them. It is just surprising something so simple could go down so much in quality. It is a case of a company trying to save a few cents at the expense of losing a reputation of quality that takes years to build."
5,Brandon's day at the Fire Station,"Brandon's Day....was obviously written with the young reader in mind, but in doing so also educates any adult that might be interested in the real workings of the Fire sevice. I myself am a professional firefighter with children and they LOVE it. I have found myself reading it with them time and time again. Brandon's Day....is a must read for any child or parent that any bit of curiosity or interest in firemen and there jobs. The colorful illustrations and the equally colorful writing are amazing and really are accurate to the actual life of firefighter. I highly recommend Brandon's Day at the Fire Station!!"
3,About what I expected,"I scanned the first few pages before purchasing this book and discovered that the cover illustration was done without any reference to descriptions of the main character. Now, this isn't enough to condemn a book...there are plenty of books in this genre that seem to run to flashy, non-substantive covers. And some of those are even good. But it's still a tip-off that, chances are, the publisher wasn't as focused as they could have been on substance.And that's the case with this book. None of the characters are ever fully fleshed-out. Neither is the political or geographical setting. This is really a book that could have used a map and a short introduction describing historical events prior to the start of the story.The book is saved from a two star rating because the poison information is interesting. Most of it is probably made up, but it was still fun to read."
5,This is Great!!!,"I must admit I was initially hesitant about this book. But the author has laid my doubts to rest. This is truly a great beginning to a series, a wonderful debut for the author to say the least and I look forward to the next novel.Yelena, a orphan child, a murderer, condemned to death for killing the son of a general...her only possibility of escape, be the food tester for the Commander. And so begins a her battle of wits with the Commander's Chief of Security, a shadowy spy and assassin who seems delighted that Yelena is testing him.But soon enemy forces, traitorous forces begin to show their hand. Even more dangerous Yelena may have magic, which the Commander has outlawed, merely being capable of magic is a death sentence and Yelena has been warned that her powers need training or she will be a danger to all!A great adventure tale, I look forward to the next book!"
4,A Magic Adventure That Will Leave You Wanting More,"The novel POISON STUDY begins with the protagonist Yelena bound and chained in the dungeons of an unknown castle, about to be executed for murdering the son of a General. Within the first few pages, however, Yelena is offered a rare chance at escaping death (or at least, execution) by becoming the poison tester for the Commander.The rest of the novel is filled with intrigue stemming from this job as poison tester, and the reader is constantly left to wonder whether someone will take revenge on Yelena for her murder of the General's son, or whether someone will try to poison the Commander and Yelena will die gruesomely poisoned. There is a love story as well, and Snyder balances intrigue, love and magic to create the perfect fantasy which leaves you wanting more. Luckily for us, there's a sequel! Highly, highly recommended."
2,Just missed,"being a good fantasy read. I am not a romance fan, but I am obsessively devoted to fantasy and it seems that combining the two leaves devotees of both genre's feeling a tad let down.The world created in this novel had some depth, and the characters were fairly well fleshed, but after the first two chapters the plot was so predictable that I had to force myself to finish the book, and to be honest, had I any other book handy I wouldn't have finished this one."
3,Okay,"This book was pretty good. The plot was a little slow at first, but then I got into it. It was very suspenseful and I could not put it down. However, towards the end it got a bit predictable and I just wanted to finish it. So basically, it was just an average book. I have read worse, but I have also read better. There was nothing about the story that made me want to purchase the other books in the series."
2,Silly,"I read this and thought, ""Wow, this is more like a romance novel than a fantasy."" I also found the characters and situations quite two-dimensional and shallow.I thought ""Luna Publishing""? Never heard of it. It seems to be a division of Harlequin. Enough said.I can't imagine any guy enjoying this. Good for a quick beach read."
1,I think I've had about enough,"I've bought three Luna books since the Harlequin division came out and Poison Study is the first book I actually read. I have to say that although Poison Study had a strong start, the story waned as it drew closer to the end. Those reading for romance will not be disappointed but for readers hoping to get something more, please look elswhere. This book is not for the faint of heart. There are vivid scenes of abuse and assault. The villians are evil for the sake of being evil. I guess you can't expect much for a Harlequin.This book is the last I will read from Luna. I've given them a chance by reading Poison Study and all I can say is that I was sorely disappointed."
4,Great fantasy read!,"It was surprisingly fun reading the adventures of Yelena, food taster to the Commander of Ixia. Yelena had been sentenced to death, but after the Commander needed a new food taster, Yelena chooses to take the job rather than then noose. She has powerful enemies of her own so so tasting food isn't the only hazard she faces. Maria Snyder created a intricate world which is familiar, but with some interesting quirks to keep the reader on their toes. The characters are fun and I love the way they interact with each other. Great light fantasy read, perfect for reading while curled up with a mug of hot coco!"
3,Everything's Easy,"The biggest problem with this book was the lack of copy editing. There were a lot of punctuation errors, but more irritating was the fact the wooden staff used in martial arts is spelled ""bo"", not ""bow"" like on a birthday gift. That aside, it was a pretty decent story, though fairly predictable. Things came too easily for Yelena, our trusty food taster turned warrior magician. Any time she needs something, there it is, whether accidentally provided by her friends or simply discovered without much effort.One thing I did sort of like was the ambiguity of the Commander. Was he a bad guy? A good guy? Or possessing the qualities of both?The kids in the high school book club I sponsor chose this book to read. They finished it much faster than I did and we've ordered the next book in the series. I wasn't blown away by this one, but I never reached a point where I dreaded picking it up again, so I'll read MAGIC STUDY and see how that one goes."
1,I am SHOCKED I read the whole thing,"I adore a good disaster book, and I understand that with these kinds of books there is a level of chaos, quick character development and jumpy storytelling. With this particular book, even with those things in mind it was so boring and I actually wanted all these people (of which there were way too many to keep track of) to fall into a hole and die. I should have just rented the Posieden adventure and had my fix."
4,Does the job,I have lost a lot of weight prior to buying this item. I actually use it more like a piece of compression clothing. It is great for holding all the jiggly skin that accompanies a large weight loss. It makes it much more comfortable to run with this belt in place.
3,Big Belt!,"I'm sure this slimmer belt would work fine if I were about a 38""+ waist...but I'm a 34"" and this belt is huge. I trimmed as much as I could from the belt and it's a little better but still a bit too big. Also, because the velcro spans the whole edge of the belt, it tends to chafe my skin. Thanks to Amazon's awesome return policy, I was able to return it and I purchased the McDavid belt and am much happier."
1,Clearly a Masterpiece,"No greater writing has been offered by a great conservative thinker since the Bible. So great is this masterpiece, that Amazon has reduced it to the low low price of $2.99 just to make sure everybody has a chance to read it!Obviously Hugh Hewitt gets it. That to ensure the future of America, we must hand over more control to Republicans. Only by lining their own pockets with bribes, giving perky no-bid contracts and earmarks to their friends, shifting the tax burden from those who inherit their wealth to those who work for a living, can we insure that Hugh Hewitt will write more books!"
3,Running out of gas,We saw fewer mythology episodes in season five and more and more silly filler episodes. It seems the writers are running out of ideas and the plots are getting weaker. The first two and the final episodes of the season were very strong.Hopefully this was just an off year and season six will regain my interest.
5,best episode up to this point,Best episode so up to this point. Very intense. I loved it! Re-watching all the X Files episodes in order and this one was my favorite so far.
3,Not as good as 3 or 4,"Season 5 is good. Not as good as the first 4 seasons, but good. After this season is where the show starts to slip..."
5,Best baseball book ever!,No question the finest baseball book I have ever read and I have have read many. Who is/was Damon Rice? Probably will read again this winter before spring training starts. A real gem!
1,does not work,"bought if from official web site, used it for about five or six months but did not work. The plastic covering in laser comb fell off and can be heard when i use the device. Have not bothered getting replacement."
2,A little out of date,"If your new to Japanese culture, you might like this book. Lots of musings about all different aspects of Japanese work culture. The problem is, a lot of it has nothing to do with what the title suggests, such as AIDS in Japan, contraception in Japan, how prejudiced the Japanese can be, you name it, the author covered it. Even the Nan King massacre is brought up. For you Japan hands, this title will provide little that is new. The book was written at the time Japan was at it's economic peak, before the bubble burst and before the 10 year long recession. Because of that, there are a lot of assumptions regarding how powerful Japan was/is going to be in the year 2000, predictions that really didn't come true. Lastly, after reading the book, if it was your intention to work for a Japanese company, you're sure not going to want to after you read this, especially if you are a woman or do not like the idea of working six days a week."
5,A nice addtition to the movie,Dances with wolves is one of my favourite movies ever. Once you see the movie as many times as I've seen it :) you try to find something else to continue the story. The ilustrated story of the epic brings you back to the movie and has very nice photos and comments of several scenes. I reccomend it to any fan of the movie.
4,This game is awsome,"The car selection, performance uprades, and visual uprades are amazing, ther are hundreds of afermarket parts to choos from you must get over 30 cars to choose from and then you get to do pink slip races that if you win get youre oppenetes car you get to have a crew of 4 people including you and you can have them race for you can also bet on races and win money some things i dont like are some of the physics like driving a rear wheel drive car is hard then all wheel or front wheel overall though its not a mistake to buy and i like it"
4,As advertised,"I can recommend this to anyone wanting to play a better game of WWF, or scrabble or the just curious."
5,Another valuable Scrabble book,"The Word-Building BookThe Scrabble Word-Building Book: Updated Editionand The Scrabble Players DictionaryThe Official Scrabble Players Dictionaryare the two required books for all Scrabble players. Bob's Bible is for those wishing to seriously delve into words, anagrams and hooks. For those purposes I find it unequaled.Ralph Maus"
2,"Check out ""What I Loved"" instead","Lucky for us, Siri Hustvedt went on to write greater things, and we can expect even more of her as she hones her craft. ""The Enchantment of Lily Dahl,"" he second novel, will disappoint those readers who absolutlely loved her novel ""What I Loved,"" an emotionally gripping, sophisticatedly plotted and lyrical novel about the intersections of love, art and life in 1980s and 1990s New York City. I found nothing really enchanting or enchanted about Hustvedt's protaganist in this one, a blond buxom waitress withering as in smalltown Minnesota but hoping for a career as an actress. The story might have been about a young woman discovering something within herself and her surroundings, but instead, the reader gets a murder mystery with a psycho, as well as a handful of caricatured and unbelievable characters who all seem to love Lily Dahl but never seem to get her. Don't judge Hustvedt by this one."
3,Great start... confusing throughout the rest,"The book had a strong beginning, and I felt it had a lot of potential. I read about 100 pages and my opinion of the book began to decline. After a very interesting start, I became confused about where the author was going with the story. Too many elements were brought in, and it just became muddled. There were some highlights however, among those, how Lily and Mabel's relationship grew.I was not enthusiastic about this story, but I plan to give Hustvedt another chance."
4,Furi FX 9-Inch Coppertail East/West Knife,"easy to handle. weight quality is nice.like the thickness. loses its edge quickly because it is a softer metal, but you are able to resharpen nicely."
5,Great J-rock music,"This is a greatest-hits CD from the Japanese rock band Yellow Monkey. This CD covers a range of styles, from ""Shock Hearts"" Beatles-esque pop-rock to track 9's Oasis-esqu moody rock. A friend from Japan let me borrow this CD last year, and I've been looking for it ever since. Since it's an import, it's a little pricy, but if you like Japanese rock music, I recommend this CD."
2,The Layman's Bible Dictionary,"I am so sorry but I was dissatisfied with this product/book -binding. I thought the book itself was put together cheap/poorly. The information was good but the binding was NOT good. I just counted it as a lost but I know who - who's for this point.Thank you,"
5,Great Product,I found this works great for all sizes of negatives. It also works for photographs as well.
4,Great Shoes,I got these shoes for my little walker. They are very cute and a bit on the heavy side (which is great for new walkers like her).
2,review of rubbermaid vertical storage 3749,side panels bow outward causing shelving to fall outdont see any acceptable way to correct without ruining visualsthe end
1,Frustrating and disappointing .,Well mine showed in a mangled box. Does not snap together as easily as claimed or stay together for the next step. I would have sent it back if the box would have been usable . Gave it 1 star because there is no zero or minus numbers.
3,"Bernadette is Wonderful, Martin, Not So Much....","Bernadette Peters could read (or sing) the phone book and be amazing (to borrow an old cliche). She shines here, Martin Short on the other hand, comes across as though each song were a SNL sketch, just as he would do a few years later in Little Me. The difference between Short and other character actors, is that they create characters, while Short remains Short with annoying voices. And annoy here he does...The score is pleasant, with a couple great songs for Peters."
1,"a dreadful experience, simply dreadful","I don't know which to complain about more bitterly: the typesetting and font, which forced me to crack the spine with considerable effort in order to make out the text, or the dull, bland, pseudo-Edwardian British style that bores one to tears before the first iota of action occurs. Finding that the linear read-through didn't work, I tried hopscotching around to detect bits of action or, indeed, any sort of episodes that might hold my interest. I failed in my quest. Take my advice: leave these dusty old works on the back shelf of a decaying library where some witless 130-year-old British gent can take them down and chortle over them."
3,Scratched,The CD I purchased from you was in ok shape. Mostly every song plays and sounds well except for one trac that keeps skipping. I'm pretty sure I read on your description that the CD did not have any Scratches. Kind of dissapointed.
4,Dora CD!,"My 2 year old watches Dora everyday. She was so surprised Christmas morning when she opened her ""Dora Songs"" and we put it in the CD player. She sings along and dances with just about all of the 40 songs. They sound just they way they do on the show. Any child who is a Dora fan is sure to love this collection."
2,"Cancled Item, was shipped and was wrong item","I wrote the Shipper informing them to not ship that would wait on item. Next thing you know they ship it and then write me telling me they were trying to get package back. Got delivery from FedEx only to find out it was not the Item as shown in Image. Ver obvious since the Package itself was 3/4 the size of the actual TailLight Assy. In addition, Return Policy is kind of messed up."
3,Wrong size,"They sent me the wrong size product. But it's very easy to return. Just fill out the form and ship it back. The box was worn out too by the way. But it is still okey though. Wish it fit, would be a. Great deal. I don't know what else to say."
1,Expensive Tool - Poor Quality,On delivery I checked the tool for run out at the chuck and found that it wobbled. I made the check based on another review. It could be due to a defective chuck or gear box output shaft run out. The tool is well featured and those features are easy to use. All that though is background noise if the tool can't perform the basic functions of drilling a round hole or driving a screw straight. Those functions cannot be performed with a chuck that wobbles for whatever reason.
5,A Journey I Enjoyed Taking,"Through first-person accounts, poems, and pictures, Wanderlust offers a journey across two continents and several generations. It tells the story of a German family that became separated when some of its members chose to make lives for themselves in America. What follows is a study of the ongoing relationship between the German-Americans and their cousins who remained in Europe. This book also offers an intimate look at life in Germany during the 1940s and the challenges facing immigrants to America in the following decades. The contributors to Wanderlust create a book that is at once historical and contemporary, American and German, young and old.On one level, this is a personal story of individuals striving to stay in touch with their roots and each other. On another level, it holds wider appeal to a nation of immigrants who can identify with this family's experiences. Either way, Wanderlust carries the reader away."
5,I bought this for my daughter,"This is a wonderful doll as are all the "" my scenes"". A letter to the CHILDREN ( yes i meant kids, babies, adolescent ones ),who feel the need to degrade an inanimate piece of plastic that brings so much joy to so many little girls all because it isn't a brand once cares to endorse , let alone purchase without an adults consent ....get a life, better yet do your HOMEWORK, i thought elementary had started. Needless to say,this is a great product."
5,WHAT??????????GET AWAY BRATZ FANS.EVEN FAIRY TALE PRINCESS,TO THE LAST GIRL WHO WROTE A REVIEW AND FAIRY TALE PRINCESS:LISTEN....FARIY TALE PRINCESS SUCK.SHE IS NOT A FRIEND OF AMAZON.CAUSE SHE IS WRITING BAD REVIEWS ABOUT MY SCENE.GET OUT OF HERE.........YOU SUCK FAIRY TALE PRINCESS........OH YAH.AND TRY TO BEAT MY REVIEW........I AM NOT AFRAID........DONT WORY........YOU CAN STOP ME..........HOW METTER IF I READ HOW YOU BEAT MY REVIEW........JUST GO AWAY FROM AMAZON.YOU ARE STUPID.~~~~******GLITTER******~~~~P.S.DONT CARE ABOUT YOU BEAT MY REVIEW.I DONT BE SAD.I LAUGH.....HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO......FAIRY TALE PRINCESS.BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!MY SCENE RULES!!!!!!
1,heh,LOL they copied their own idea! lol i have the Teresa locker doll in the original barbie one... somwehere. it's probably been sent to the salvation army by now HAHAi think this doll is for younger kids...
5,A Good Place to Start,"If you are interested in getting into the Antiques and Collectibles market, this book gives some good starter tips, even though it is rather old. While it does not cover the incredibly expanding online and auction market, it is a good source for tips on where to find inventory, how to purchase inventory, how to set up a B&M shop/mall space, and how to be ""antique"" savvy."
4,Dated but there's still lots of good advice here,"Like other reviewers have said, this book doesn't take into account the Internet factor. But there's still lots of good advice in this book that hasn't changed: What to look for, how to negotiate, and how to get to the good stuff first. These gems will be good for the next century and beyond--as long as people hold yard/garage/tag sales and people use automobiles for travel.If you want eBay advice, there are hundreds of other books that give you that. But I haven't found one of those books yet that contains the good old-fashioned advice this book has. Plus, some of the old-fashioned salesmanship advice in this book translates well to online venues.This book reads quickly (read for about an hour before bed and you'll have it knocked out in less than a week), it's entertaining, and it's inexpensive. Pay the cover price plus shipping and it'll still cost you less than $10. You'll probably make your 10 bucks back the Saturday after you finish it. I did."
3,acceptable,Bought the whole set of these to replace the old wiss aviation snips. No contest here at all Wiss is the best by far. These stanley snips will do for now and they are not bad quality at all and if Wiss is too expensive for you (my current situation) then these will keep you going while you save up.
5,Love the whole collection!,"Unlike the customer above, I've had no bad experience with this product. It opens and shuts as it was made to, and I put it in the dishwasher.Could be she doesn't like Tupperware as much as she said, since all over her reviews are neg. for tupperware. Hum...."
5,Excellent tool,"This is the third identical cordless drill we have purchased: one for my husband and one for each of our young adult sons. I don't have any feedback to report from our sons, but this Makita is my husband's favorite tool of all time. He uses it for all sorts of projects around the house and has found it to have plenty of power. It is dependable; I've never heard him complain about any aspect of its use."
2,"Good drill, bad batteries",This is a good drill. I had it for about 4 years and it worked great for me. But the biggest disappointment are the batteries. I got this drill because I wanted NiMH batteries which are supposed to have no or less memory effect than NiCd versions. However now after 4 years these batteries cannot hold the charge anymore. They are basically dead.Instead of buying two new batteries for around $120 I am now getting a new drill (Bosch) with 18V Li-Ion batteries for the same price as the two new batteries for the Makita.In addition to the batteries Makitas seem to have a issue with wobbling drill chucks. Mine does too but only very little.In summary: Good drill but useless with dead batteries. And replacement batteries are way too expensive. Especially for outdated NiMH technology.
5,What Horses Reveal,Klaus Hempfling believes that all horses can be divided into 26 types. He has written this book to show these types and how to train each one. There are lengthy descriptions of each type of horse as well as explanations of how to train them in detail so that their individual characteristics can be taken into account. It is a beautifully illustrated book and the DVD that goes with it is worth having as well. The book is fascinating to read and the sort that will be gone back to many times for reference.
1,"Poor, out of date coverage, too many things don't work","This book needs a rewrite with more current coverage, better testing of code and packages prior to release. And please remove the puerile humour, it doesn't work; humour in a book should be like safron in a curry, appreciated for its subtlty. Have a look at the 'Teach Yourself Java 1.1 in 24 hours' for an author who uses humour to great effect.I am a CORBA specialist and past Senior Systems Engineer (OS/390) for Iona, who supply Orbix - a commercial implementation of CORBA."
4,Very Pleased with Item and Service,"My daughter loves Jessie from Toy Story 2, and we were very excited to find this playset on Amazon for her birthday. She really enjoys playing with this doll and is very proud of her (she is a frequent visitor to show and share at school.) The sleeves of the outfits are a little difficult for my 4 year old to manage when changing the clothes, but otherwise the clothing is very easy to change. The doll is very poseable. She can't really ride Bullseye very well, but she CAN ride Breyer horses quite well. This seller was GREAT! He got the item out very quickly-- we ordered a little last-minute and sent a message letting tyhem know we were trying to get it for a birthday and they sent personal emails to us to let us know we would have it-- and we did. The packaging was in mint condition so we were able to wrap it in the packaging (sometimes when we have bought toys from resellers we have found the packaging slightly damaged-- not this time!)"
3,Cute. Christmas Movie or Family Friendly Seekers Might Want to Check it Out.,"Feel good, fun and predictable. If you are a collector of Christmas movies or looking for family friendly entertainment, I think you are safe with this one. There are some amusing lines and a little physical humor thrown into the romantic comedy recipe. I'm not going to buy it but I didn't dislike it either. Give it a rent if you are tired of the same old, same old."
4,A Wholesome Romantic Christmas Comedy,"At last...! There is a honest-to-goodness romantic comedy that you can take your kids to and still enjoy it as an adult. There is something for every family member. The screenplay is quasi-original...twisted in a unique melo-dramatic/comedy genre.The music is sweet basil to the ears and warms the heart...should be sold as a soundtrack, but it's hard to find.Don't listen to the amateur critics here...this film is a keeper for $15.00."
4,:0),enjoyed the book i liked the sisters relationship ..but was wondering if the sister was going to hook up with the cousin in another book
5,Una obra profunda,¿Cuál es la mejor interpretación de las suites para chelo? El gran Yo-Yo Ma nos lleva de viaje a las profundidades estéticas de Bach.
5,very satisfied,"Product was just as described, installed easily, and works great. Shipped on time, price was good."
3,RUST ALREADY!!!,"I bought this same identical item at Bed Bath and Beyond 6 years ago, LOVED IT and it took 5 years before the shelf started to rust. I have had this one up less than a month and it is already rusting. NOT HAPPY!!! I bought some clear Rustolium paint to try to stop this. Other than the premature rust I like the product."
2,Oh Brave New World,"If nothing else this book reminds you of why you can't take blurbs seriously.As the excerpts fromthe review would have it this is a masterpiece.Not!The author throws too many chararacters at you too soon and you can't remeber whothey are or figure out why you should care.You quickly learn to distinguish goodies from badies.Good-Athieists,Gays,Progressives.Bad-everyone else.Wer'e in a shallow PC world here.Still the author can be pretty funny.I suspect this would be a much better book if it didn't try so hard.He is a good observer and clever but he is not a thinker."
5,Just a great pick,"These are the best small profile picks for the price. Although I prefer the heavy gauge variety, I am fine playing the mediums as well. Highly recommended pick."
5,samantha mini doll,i always wanted this doll for ever and now i got it.and i know that the book had small but i just like the doll better and she was so pretty that i went crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Review of Tozer text,"I thought the book was very well written. I liked the way the book was broken down into chapters, the review at the end of each chapter was great for summation. The book followed our syllabus in a very concise way."
4,Textbook review,The Tozer book was a very thorough overview of the history of education in the United States. The primary source readings at the end of the chapters were enjoyable and gave a bit more depth to the chapter preceding it. I also enjoyed the photographs and illustrations (I guess I tend to be a very visual learner). I do not feel the questions for discussion and examination were necessary at the end of the chapters. At times the text was not very objective but overall was quite a useful book.
4,"Compass Guide--Gulf South, Louisiana, Alaama & Mississippi",The bookI received had obviously been looked at/used by someone previously. There are notations in a few of the margins and a few yellow highliter marks on some pages
2,Sad that we are still mad about the past,"I can`t stand this german haters anymore. All the time hollywood is PRODUCING the germans as stereotypes. As nazis. They are bad they are bla bla. God damit! We aren`t saints too. We killed over 3 mill indians.Germany is a very beautiful country and the people are nice and friendly. Let the past in the past, because they are our friends."
4,"Not perfect, but great fun nonetheless...","The orchestrations for the film version of ""The Producers"" are simply fantastic! They are full of energy and life and remind me of the type of arrangments MGM gave their classic musical films in the '40s and '50s. Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick throw themselves into their performances with an infectious energy and excitement. Will Ferrell is hysterically funny as Franz -- should be perfect in the role on film. Uma Thurman certainly LOOKS the part of Ulla, but vocally she is the weakest link on this CD. Not bad, it just could've been better. Some parts are missing from this disc that can be found on the OBC recording, such as the ""Showboat"" style introduction to ""I Wanna Be a Producer"" -- however it is possible that a lot of these omissions will be present in the movie (not room for them on the CD). I think Lane's vocal on ""Betrayed"" is better here than the OBC disc. FYI -- Borders is selling this CD with an extra bonus track -- ""In Old Bavaria."""
3,West Coast Trail map review,"I expected more detail of the actual trail - it is a large map, mostly of the surrounding areas, so somewhat disappointed.West Coast Trail Map by ITMB (Travel Reference Map)"
1,reminds me of the old Bratz..Feelin Pretty collection.The worst of 2006 line,"This Jade is ugly.I didn`t liked the feelin pretty collection.Spesially Sasha.They reminds me of the old Bratz.I liked the 2006 line Bratz collections,but 2005 was better.This collection is the worst of this year.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*"
2,Not casino quality.,I enjoy playing blackjack and wanted to shore up my basic strategy knowledge before my Vegas trip and ordered these playing cards. I was not impressed with the quality of the cards and was never able to have my blackjack party before Vegas. They play fine and shuffle alright but if you are expecting casino quality then you will not be satisfied. If you are looking for casual beer game cards then these will work perfect.
4,It's a K&N what more do you want?,"K&N filters are what they are. They are oiled gauze sandwiched between metal screen. I've used them for years in my cars and SUV's. There is always somebody that says that they suck at filtering or that they let this much dust through.... I have 268k on the clock of my Camry. About 200k of it is with a K&N and it's still kicking. Just make sure you keep it clean every so often. I typically clean mine at about 10k miles, or every 3rd oil change, but that's just me. I feel that my mileage went up by 1-2mpg, not enough to change the world but the car revs a little more peppy too and I like that. All in all, you can't beat one. I've paid for it in filter savings at least 3 times over at this point.... good product."
4,The diary of a mad man,"Sometimes the line is blurred between being a genius and being a mad man. Rimbaud is such a case. While I am not convinced by Robb's thesis that Rimbaud is a poet-genius who has been grossly overlooked, one cannot help but being at awe to read about his extremely outrageous behaviour and his unconventional life style. His relationship with Verlain is one of the highlight of this book. But his later life in search of his identity in various exotic locale, is much more interesting.Robb has done a great job in telling this unusual life. But somehow his story telling is not as fluid as his ""Victor Hugo"" book which I admire very much. Compared to his work on Victor Hugo, one can't help but feel that this Rimbaud's book has been put too hastily."
2,Undisciplined and patronizing,"I found this book impossible to read.I had hoped to find a substantive biographical narrative.Instead I found an undisciplined, distracted and patronizing melange.There are two problems here.First, the author constantly changes voices. One voice is the biographical narrative. The second is gratuitous English 101 literary criticism. The third voice is even more intrusive, a psychological analysis that is apparently based on the author's politics, prejudices and enthusiasms.The second problem is this.When assuming the latter two voices, in particular, the text is shaded when not overwhelmed by the author's perceptions and opinions.As a result this is neither biography nor history.It's a personal assessment, a critique and a memoir.I'm still looking for a good bio of Rimbaud.Anybody know of one?"
3,ok,This product is the perfect size for my papatese puppy. It was very easy to assemble. The only problem is that my puppy can open the latch and is waiting for me by the front door when I come home. He just hits the latch a few times and it slides right open. So if you don't want your dog to get out you may want to buy a lock for this item.
3,not good for crate training,"This crate was very easy to put together & is fairly sturdy - EXCEPT for the bottom tray. There is a panel that supposedly secures the tray but does not do a great job. My 2 yr old (50 lb) shepherd was able to push the tray halfway out of the crate within 15 minutes. She was then able to move the entire crate around by pushing on the tray. She was also able to chew off some of the corners of the tray. Today she pushed the tray halfway out & managed to break it into sharp pieces. Luckily she did not hurt herself doing so. We had thought about using zip ties to further secure the tray but did not have a chance.I removed the bottom tray entirely & she seems to be doing okay in the crate now. For dogs that are being crate trained, this is not a good crate to start with. Maybe if she did not have separation anxiety & want to get out of it - it would be fine."
5,excellent small pet crate,"Received quickly from the seller. Very easy to assemble right out of the box, no tools. Excellent black finish and look. We leave it open in the TV room and moved the dog bed into it and now our dog sleeps and lounges in it. He doesn't mind when we leave him crated in it when we go out. No more surprise ""torn"" items when you come home."
5,Perfect!,"Needed crates and didnt want to spend a fortune. The crates were perfect, larger than expected, but that was a big plus for us:)We have 2 Jack Russells and they fit perfect in them with room to move.Very happy with the quality. Exactly what I was looking for."
5,Just what I needed,The crate was just what I needed for my Shepherd Mix dog. Very large and gives him plenty of room to stretch and not be cramped in.
5,Huge Crate!,"I recently purchased the 42x28x30 crate for my 4 month old German Shepherd. He was quickly growing out of his smaller crate as he is already over forty pounds. I was unsure before ordering whether this would be a sufficiently sized crate for my dog when he is mature. I will tell you we joking call this his condo because it is huge. I am 5'3"" and 110 lbs. and me and my dog could fit in this crate (we actually did lol!). Plus the free divider makes it great as a training crate. If you are considering a crate for a large breed dog like a German Shepherd, this is a great crate for your dog. It is also very sturdy and easy to set up. I am so happy that I saved money and got a great crate!"
4,"Easy to assemble, folds nicely, great deal","I ordered this for my new pupy on Friday afternoon, and received it monday morning. I ordered a bed to go inside it. The two together were still about $50 less ( for just the crate) than the large pet store. I love amazon, great deal. If only someone could come and crate train the puppy. With that said, it also cleans nicely."
4,"Easy, dog loves it!","Our 9 month old golden lab/lab retriever mix puppy outgrew his old crate, and looked like he was being put in a squad car (""duck that head!"") when we put him in his old crate. He is digging his new, larger crate and I am very happy with how easy it was to set up (once I was able to unlatch the side panels). Thank you!"
5,Perfect!,"Great quality, easy to put together, included a divider, much larger than expected, and includes a handle so I can transport it easily. Very happy!"
5,Good cage.,Cage is easy to setup and easy to clean. I'm glad I purchased it. I have to cage my cat at night because he's ate $200 worth of my stuff. It works well for him.
2,Good size but not durable,"We bought this for our 65lb Great Pyrenees/Anatolian shepherd mix and the size was perfect. The door latches are not strong at all and she managed to be the bottom one open and then squeeze out the door. The next time, she was able to destroy the liner and then destroyed our carpet under the crate.... And she bent the bars on the crate. So, the size is great for big dogs, but not nearly strong enough. We've on,y had it a week and its already trashed."
5,Great Crate at Great Price!!,I was a little leary to buy this crate at this price because I thought that it may not be made sturdy. I am very pleased with this crate!!! It is super sturdy and I am so glad I got it. Will be ordering another one for our other puppy. Great buy!!
2,Tray is not great.,My dog is under 10 lbs and after the second day of being left alone in this cage she was able to tear apart the entire bottom tray rendering the cage useless until I can get a replacement. I recommend looking for a cage with a metal bottomed tray if you are unsure on how your dog will react to being left alone.
1,disdspointed,I paid full price and received a used product. Very dissapointing. Packaging had been opened previously and taped back closed. Product looks obviously used. Would not reccomend this to a friend. Hopefully your experience will be better than mine was. Overall a great product for the price. I just dont appreciate paying full price for a customer return.
2,weak,Weak cage my dog keeping breaking out of it we had to put extra locks on the cage to keep him in
5,My daughter love this,Love this its so nice and easy to clean. The only down side is it doesnt have handles so my daughter tends to grab the side of toilet. But the hanger that comes with is perfect when she is not using the potty.
2,Wobbly & Not as pictured,"I echo others' sentiments that this seat is wobbly. We have an old, traditional shaped toilet & I do not feel comfortable allowing my daughter to sit by herself. Once when she did use it, urine escaped out the front between the seat and the potty. I thought that only happened with little boys!!Also, the seat I received was not as pictured. Instead of yellow ducks and a blue handle, my seat has dark orange ducks and a purple handle. I would have returned it, unfortunately my husband opened the package before I looked at it. One further criticism: it comes shrink-wrapped and I couldn't easily remove all of the plastic, so there is a small piece still attached to the ring underneath - yucky when you think about it getting peed on."
2,Leaks,This seat has a seam on the inside of the cushy part of the seat. This traps urine and distributes it all around the seam and the seat. My son used it for a couple of weeks before I had enough of cleaning and wiping my whole toilet and surrounding floor after each use. We bought a thin flip seat that works like a charm.
2,mommy's helper not so helpful,"bought based on recommendation from toddler bargains book. agree with prior reviewers, NOT appropriate for elongated toilets. my toddler is a tall little man and we have to push this seat so far back on the elongated toilet he seems way too far back on the seat and it just doesn't fit properly. he's too far back on the toilet and I don't like the gap in the front of the thing. we'll keep, throw it in the car and take it for potty breaks on the road. looking at wee pod or baby bjorn, potty seats specifically made for elongated seats or at least capable of being adjusted. the cushy seat is definitely nice on wee bum-bums."
2,ok,its ok s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s ssssssssssssssssss sssssssssssssss ssssssssssssssssssss sssssssssssss
3,solid drill with a few caveats,"This is my third makita drill so I consider myself biased. I don't use it all day but I need a quality drill for household repairs. The electric makita drill I've had now for fifteen years and it still runs fine. My second, I bought one of those 9 volt drills when the first cordless drills came out. I good drill but it's for light work. The batteries on this I've used all day without a recharge, alot longer than the models a few years ago. I've had problems with the chuck though. On many occasions the drill bit will come loose with smaller bits. The cap has come loose. Still it's put up with all the abuse I've given it."
2,SJS Commercial probably to blame,"I bought this drill from a company called SJS Commercial via Amazon. The batteries that came with the drill were almost useless. I could only drill 3 or 4 holes until the battery died. Useless in other words. I contacted SJS Commercial, and they refused to correct this because my ""return window"" had recently expired."
5,Almost perfect.,"In truth, I would give this beautifully performing unit a 4.5 stars. But since the choice was between 4 or 5 stars, I figured 5 would be closer to the truth. I have used this unit daily for over a year with no problems whatsoever. It's charge lasts a long time under a good deal of abuse (drilling through metal etc). It's metal gears are very durable. The power is very good as well. I wish it did have 450lbs of torque, though. Our 14.4 volt Dewalt has a little more power. But it's not as durable. So a tradeoff I guess. I would take my Makita over the Dewalt though."
1,HANDHELD FIRE STARTER,It's really a bummer to be drilling along and have your drill start to catch fire.I was working outside in the winter at 10 below zero with a pair of heavy chopper mitts on so i did not feel the drill warming up until it started to pour out smoke. by then it was ruined and barely out of the warranty based on time. It was however only the second time I had used the drill. Garbage. I also see that several 2 star reviewers had the same problem!!!!!!!!
5,Makita 6347 DWSDE 19-VOLT NIMH CORDLESS DRILL/DRIVER KIT,"I bought this drill to replace a Makita 9.6 volt. I had used the old one until the batteries died. I bought the 9.6 volt in a pawn shop and used it for years.This 18 volt is really great for my needs. I am a female with smaller hands. So, most of the higher voltage drills are to heavy for me to use for very long (short time with two hands). I appreciate the adjustable clutch.I have a Dewalt corded drill. There are times when I need to drill then drive without having to change accessory's so two drills are really handy. The Dewalt handle is so big and heavy. My fingers won't reach around it. The Dewalt does not have an adjustable clutch. You are suppossed to be able to adjust it with pressure of the fingers (ha).The short charging time on the Makita is great. I do not have to leave it plugged in for hours. I am really enjoying using my new Makita."
5,brilliant,"An amazing debut only equalled by their later ""stay together"" EP and the b-side of Trash: ""Every Monday Morning Comes"". I've met a lot of people who only became interested in the band after ""Coming Up"" album. And while the latter is very good (""picnic by the motorway"" is probably the most quintessential suede song EVER), this is brilliant in comparison and deserves all the praise it got in its early days.People that know the music of Morissey, Bowie and Lloyd Cole will probably be scratching their heads as to why this band has constantly been accused of copying these. Yes there are elements of each in lyrics and instrumentation, but never more than any other band. A bit like saying Guns n Roses are unoriginal; yes and no, but they do the job very well regardless.Standout tracks are Animal Nitrate, Moving and Metal Mickey.Many people found the followup album dark and depressing and it is (best left to smith fans and other wrist slashers)"
4,Just a poor printing for such a marvellous release,"Suede's self tittled first album was a landmark for british music, such was the hysteria created by fans, critics and the media around the band.This remastered deluxe edition has 2 cds with the album and lots of b sides and some rarities (""Brass in pocket"" is such a great rare cover, for example), plus a DVD with clips and the ""Love and poison"" concert, previously just released on VHS.It's just a shame that the cover art looks so badly printed, outshinning the marvellous edition.Even so, all the Suede's albuns special deluxe edition worth their price, and are a must have for fans or people who likes britpop and/or lived in the 90's listening to good music at those times!"
4,I DO LIKE THIS ONE,"I have owned mine for about 3 years most knives break within the first year for me. The thing I have found is that most quick change knives load and unload from the front After awile the blade holder gets weak and fails to hold the blade(not very safe). Not with this knife, I have never had this happen. the only reason i need a new one is that it was ran over and broke. As a contractor for more than 15 years I do believe that I have found the perfect knife."
1,screwed,"I am creating my own portfolio(for art) that has a screwpost binding so I needed these screwpost in black I saw the picture were the screwpost were black and I assumed they were black never payed attention to the word zinc...so I received zinc scewpost...ok you can say thats my fault....however the free shipping for ADORAMA was attractive until I was ready to return the screwpost they noted a 8.95 return fee! I never saw this anywhere Are you serious I politely called to speak to a supervisor, this is not a large item ...they waived the fee and I in return will never order from adorama again, I also wil pay attention to what is written and not just go by the picture."
5,And Still The Waters Run,The book we bought was used but the one we received was like new and the price was great. We could not expect any more from a seller.
5,Amazing Biography of Soul Icon,"This book deserves five stars because it is an intimate, insightful, and beautifully haunting tale of the story of one of soul's greatest architects. I first read the book and then purchased it as a gift for my father and we both agreed it was an amazing biography. If you have an interest in R&B and its cultural influence, this is a must buy!"
1,sweet soul music by The Spinners,This was awful Bobby's voice was gone and so was the other guy who tried to take Phil's place It's time to retire. The singing was very difficult to listen to This as a waste of money!!!!
5,My Granddaughter loves it,I bought it based on the glowing reviews here. My 4 year old granddaughter loves it. She had no problem figuring out how to use it and it has kept her attention.
4,A good fun start.,"This was a fun beginning to an even funner series. This book introduces Jim Digris , The Stainless Steel Rat, to the universe. Just like the the rest of the series this book is light on details but makes up for it in pace and oddball fun. Not an incredibly deep or thought provoking read but slippery Jim is the kind of criminal you can root for."
2,Not what I thought,This product is really small. I was looking for a FRUIT BOWL and this is more of a single serving fruit bowl not the type that you put on your counter with whole fruit in.
2,Work but fall apart,I purchased these for our basement door so our cat could get to her litter box. Like another reviewer ours ripped. More so if you take it off once and a while to be able to close the door. And even when we did not remove the panda we had it rip. We did super glue it and it would work for a while.
3,Stupidly Entertaining - in a good way,"A good case of comedic horror. Funny characters, semi interesting story line, etc. Certainly worth a watch, but leave your politically correct sensibilities at the door."
5,Great Gory Horror Fun!!,"I had watched 2001 Maniacs the other night for the first time. I have to say this was such a fun movie to watch! This film was funny and very gory. The film has a great cast including Robert Englund, Lin Shaye, Christa Campbell, Wendy Kremer and many more. I would say this was Robert Englund's best role in a film besides Freddy.A group of college kids on their way to Spring Break take a detour. They come upon the small southern town of Pleasant Valley. The people of the town and Mayor Buckman(Robert Englund) insist that the kids stay for their annual festival. The kids decide to stay and check it out and that's where the madness begins!Tim Sullivan did a great job sticking to the story of the original H.G. Lewis classic Two Thousand Maniacs. This is one of the best horror films of the past few years. It has some great gory death scenes too! I would recommend it highly to any horror fan!"
5,most politically incorrect Bush bashing film ever,"Robert Englund plays the homocidal Mayor of a southern town ""George W."" Buckman, who presides over a weekend of mayhem at the expense of northern visitors unlucky enough to wander into the town's annual ""festival"".Lots of beautiful people being killed in ways never before seen on screen. More a comedy than a horror film.I loved it."
3,Expected More,"To be honest, I expected more from this book, specially as it is Osprey. The title is SOVIET battlefield helicopters, but mr. Oliver is reviewing only helicopters from Mil design bureau, and not all of them...As Kamov helicopters do not exist...Also presentation of different types of those Mil helicopters is the other way around - from widely used Mi-24 at the beginning, to Mi-2 and Mi-4 at the end.Once again - Expected more from this book!"
5,GREAT handle holders,"They are bright and cheery. They ""WORK""! I love the little loop for hanging. I use them EVERY day. I wish they came in more prints and designs."
3,A little pricey,"No doubt they are handy but for the price they could make them thicker. You will feel some heat from the handle of a hot skillet, but not enough to burn you."
5,Addicted to feedback!,"I used to be afraid to show my work to anyone, but now I crave responses. Toxic Feedback really helped me make the transition, and I can't tell you how rewarding it is."
4,One of my favorite obscure movies!,"Let me start this off by saying Odd Jobs in NOT a film for everybody. If you like very wacky comedies and don't mind your humor being dumb, you may enjoy Odd Jobs. The charm of the film is difficult to describe, as the story is rather absurd, the situations are ridiculous, the writing is unsophisticated, and the characters are one-dimensional. Put all those together in this right combination though, and you get a very funny and memorable movie. The hightlights of Odd Jobs are Jake Steinfeld (the Body By Jake guy) as a villanous yet funny henchman, and Leo Burmeister as Wylie, a redneck greasy trucker with a heart of gold. The cast of comedians each has a distinct character, and each has several funny scenes to shine in.If you like Monty Python wackiness, and you like Airplane! type dumb yet funny comedy, give Odd Jobs a try. You may find a hidden comedy treasure."
1,Spend your money on something else,"I heard the song ""only time"" several times and that was what prompted me to buy the CD. However, The quality of the disk is not good. The other two songs on the CD are so poorly done that they don't deserve a second playing."
1,Don't Buy Gas-Powered Equipment From Amazon,"I purchased this generator this past summer and it was damaged during shipping, though it was only apparent after removing it from the box (bent frame). Although I never added any fluids to the unit, Amazon refused to replace the generator, citing ""danger from combustible liquids"" or something. As I stated, the unit was bone dry. Stick with a vendor who has the ability to deal with after-the-sales service. Hate to give the unit itself 1 star, because it is a very nice generator, but Amazon has no business selling this type of equipment."
1,"Not worth it, even as a joke","looking through this book, just for a laugh didn't even work. Characterized by complete raving and baseless claims, Horowitz comes off as a lunatic. Further reading of horowitz body of work included arguments that blacks ""benefitited from slavery"". This guy really is a nut"
1,Useless hyperbole,Horowitz continues his crusade against academics who have the bad taste to disagree with him. Absolute waste of money. Read it in the store if you must; you won't be able to last more than five minutes at a time anyway.
3,Horowitz is a true master of the smear!,"This is a great example of a useful tactic in the war of ideas. If you have a particular agenda (for example, how the US should enthusiastically support Israel and everything it does), you write a book in which professors critical of Israel get labeled Anti-Israel, or Anti-semitic and lump them together with profs who are unpopular due to their ideas on topics such as pedophilia.Probably 90% of readers will then equate critics of Israel's oppression of Palestinians or critics of America's ""War on Terror"" to pedophiles.Masterful. Three stars was a compromise between my love of it from the standpoint of a propaganda connoisseur and my hate of it for being bad for America."
1,More of the same from an out of touch idealogue,"More what you say? After reading I found more:- lying about liberal america- racist themes- lumping of people into convenient groups for Mr. Horowitz to bash- more hate- more vitiolSave your money, buy something worthwhile like ""America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction"". I think this would provide people with a better insight to what is wrong with folks like Mr. Horowitz."
1,Complete rubbish,"This is a paranoid and wildly inaccurate account of what is going on in U.S. universities. If you like to scare yourself with fantasies of mind control, this may amuse you. But it should not be taken seriously."
1,It would be funny if it weren't so sad,"Probably the most (although certainly not the only) ludicrous part of this book is the entry on Caroline Higgins, a professor at Earlham College. Horowitz objects to Higgins because she teaches a course on peace activism -- a course taken by students in the Peace and Global Studies program, at a Quaker college. It seems odd, to say the least, for a supposed champion of religious freedom to object to people at a Quaker school voluntarily enrolling in classes devoted to a central Quaker value. That Horowitz resorted to including such a weak objection, and one involving such a tiny private college, shows that he really must have been stretching to get his list to 101."
1,Very Bad.,"This book is bad. This badly written book oozes badness from every badly written sentence. It is bad beyond all conceivable concepts and notions of badness.Well, maybe it's not that bad, but Lord it isn't good."
1,"It is your right as an American to read this immoral, lying trash.","It is easy to read, I'll give it that. Luckily, I borrowed a copy from a relative and didn't have to buy it. (""No comment"" to the relative, who I need to keep on cordial terms, for family/relations reasons).This book is a steaming collection of unmitigated BS,lies, and more BS.I hesitate to call Mr. Horowitz an America-hater, but there is evidence aplenty of it in this book.However, as much as I disagree with the filth between the covers of this loathsome volume, I still would defend any and every American's right to read it.In fact, reading it shines a light on the truly evil and malevolent essence of the Radical Right's efforts to destroy all oposing viewpoints to their own narrow ideology in this country.Our college campuses are in their crosshairs now.But please, *borrow a copy*, and don't reward the author of such filth by contributing to his royalties."
1,chilling implications,"It is frightening indeed when they start coming after the intellectuals. The right-wing now controls all three branches of government as well as the media, and it would seem that Horowitz envisions a world where academia goose-step to the same tune. In this pivotal time, it is important to remember the words of Rev. Martin Niemoller who said in 1945, ""First they came for the Communists, and I didn't speak up, because I wasn't a Communist. Then they came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up, because I wasn't a Jew. Then they came for the Catholics, and I didn't speak up, because I was a Protestant. Then they came for me, and by that time there was no one left to speak up for me.""As a side note, I think it's telling that some of the one-star reviews have been pulled while a reviewer who unabashedly uses verbal violence such as ""die leftist scum"" is free to post."
2,"a few good movies here,but most of the transfers are very poor","i own many of the 50 movie packs and have liked most of them,but even though i am very willing to except a little drop of quality on the sets because of the price, this is one set that is not done very well. the set has some good films on it but most are unwatchable so maybe look at other sets that may have the same movies in them. you have been warned."
3,Not quite comedy classics,"There are several movies in this that are not comedies. Some, such as ""Made for Each Other,"" with Carole Lombard and James Stewart, has some light humor, it is really a drama. Even drama requires humor in order to come off well.There is a some over emphasis on some. The East End Kids are featured many times. This takes away time for other great comedies. Cary Grant was great in comedy due to his delivery. There is only one Grant movie.The Keystone Cops movies I watched were not the classic slap-stick comdies that I expect. In fact, they hardly had anything to do in the movie. ""Lil Abner,"" was listed as starring Buster Keaton. Wrong. Buster played Lonesome Polecat. The star was Jeff York as Lil Abner.Don't expect the slick movies of today. These were done over 50 years ago. For their time, they were pretty good.Over all, knowing what to expect, this is still a good buy."
1,Too smelly - like cough syrup - yuck,Wish I could say I liked it - it smells like some awful cough syrup I took as a child and sadly the odor does not dissipate! There are other products on the market that provide shine without the odor.
4,"Printed Insanity, not for everyone","Tank Girl is the epitome of a cult classic. It is definately not your traditional comic, there isn't much plot to speak of, nor is there much depth in the stories. This is not the book to read for concise social commentary or introspection. This magic of Tank Girl lies in its incredible art, cathartic writing, and the interaction between the numerous insane characters (as well as the characters and the creators). I would reccommend Tank Girl to someone with a very twisted sense of humor and an open mind. It's not for everyone, and does take a different mind set to appreciate. The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is that one or two of the stories in this book were a little too slow at points, and some of the pages were too cluttered. These are minor gripes, but I don't want to say it's a perfect collection. But worth the $."
1,Big disapointment,"There are a lot of T-Rex compilations about so I ordered this and the Very Best of Marc Bolan & T Rex, thinking I would pretty much get all the T-Rex tracks I liked, unfourtunatly what I didn't realise is this contains alternate takes and live versions of the tracks, and for me they just don't cut it, the studio tracks are the version that didn't get used ( wonder why ?) and the live tracks lack the energy of the studio originals that made them so special.I would only recomend this if you are a Fan and have everything else by T-Rex, otherwise steer clear."
2,Good for new fans.,"If you have been a U2 fan for a while you probably have already heard just about everything on this CD. It is well done. The narrator is good, but there really isn't any new information on it. If you are a ""new"" fan you might learn something. A waste of money for any fans who have already read more than a couple bios about the band or have read any books about them."
2,Slow but cheap,Not as fast as I would have liked. I have not checked its accuracy with boiling water and an ice bath.
1,"Bigger than described...not a doll house, just a tent!","I had to really search to find the Barbie Cloud Castle dollhouse so I could leave a review. It is no longer searchable by its title. I suspect that this item may have been discontinued due to customer dissatisfaction.We purchased this for our 5 year-old and 3 year-old this Christmas.The finished measurements are WAY over 4'x4'...they are 5'x5'.The floors and snap together parts are impossible to make stay in place, even using the helpful tips of other Amazon reviewers.My children had a lot of fun playing inside the castle, though. Unfortunately, they could only play with their Barbies on the ground, since the castle floors wouldn't stick. There was PLENTY of room in the castle to play games, puzzles, toys, etc. But that's a lot of money to pay for a tent! We wanted a Barbie doll house.We ended up taking it back to the store and waiting until another, more traditional style was in stock and purchased that instead."
3,"Size is good, but opens in my purse","At last, I found a medicine box that can handle all my supplements and medication easily. It handles big vitamin and calcium tablets (Centrum Chewables, Citrical Max) easily.It's easy to load. However, it opens in my purse most everytime I put it in there. That is frustrating. I have to hunt around in the bottom of my purse to find my vitamins, etc.It works for now, but I'm on the lookout for something that stays closed better."
2,Bottomless Bag,"This book is not designed for the educational classroom unless it is taught out doors. It would be great for a ropes program, PE class, weekend Girl/Boy Scout group, or church youth group."
4,Another great Rohnke Title,"This is another must have resources book for anyone working with teams or leadership programs. Rohnke's books -- including this one (The Bottomless Bag Again"" are filled with practical and informative games to spice up any learning program. Lots of programs for adults and youth alike. I require all my trainers to have this book on their shelf."
3,"Nice quality, but different color same as previous reviewer","On ours, its the Pepper shaker that is more white and the salt shaker is more yellow. If I could swap with the other reviewer that would make it right. Amazon will refund but not exchange, and the new price is double the sale price we got. So we'd have to spend double to try a new set, not sure what we're doing now, probably returning. Too bad, would have benn a great looking set."
2,A disapointment,I loved Ortberg's - YOu can't walk on water....- so I thought this would be another great. I really could not get into it at all because it borders too much on pantheism - that God in IN everything. I can agree that God can be everywhere- he is Omnipresent. But I draw the line in that God is in the butterfly or in the tree. The Bible does not teach that. Spent good money for the book - hardback - and though I don't want it; neither is it the kind of book that I want to share.
3,Not bad,"This book is a pretty decent book if you are interested in a mostly narrative style of discussion on Christian Living. Entertaining, well written, and clear, I would recommend it if you are looking for this type of book."
4,Good Stocking Stuffer,I purchased this as a stocking stuffer for my dear hunter. The camo isn't the greatest quality but mixes it up from the boring plain colors.
3,Swansong,"When I first got this one, I had never heard a song on it. As a longtime fan, I bought it based on the fact they were a good band. Time has been kind to this release I guess. I kind of rediscovered it a few years ago. ""Got to Wake Up"" is the best track and several others are good (""Harrow Road"", ""Looking For A Song""). Many others range from interesting to downright forgetful."
4,Not a bad final effort,"No, this is not the greatest BAD album, but it is not their worst either. Certainly nothing approaches their first two releases for inspired genius. HOWEVER, I would certainly put ""Looking for a Song"" and a few others here up there with some of the great BAD songs. I don't know, I never really understood why Mick kept moving away from the movie and audio clips in the songs. It seems that he was trying to make an effort to return some of that quirky sampling in this album. I think any real fan of BAD will appreciate this album."
2,Big Audio a.k.a. Big Audio Dynamite= Over produced Album.,"Higher Power (1994) marks the return of B.A.D. parts one and two under a new moniker BIG AUDIO. I have no idea why they got rid of ""Dynamite"". The band sounds the same and the songs remain the same. But unlike the other discs, this one is very over produced (I guess for the lack of music quality they decided to beef it up in the mixing process). The best tracks are Stone Age Blues and Looking for a Song. Bring back Don Letts and Leo Williams!The band made one more album (same band but they decided to rename themselves Big Audio Dynamite). I guess Mick's musical talent disappeared faster than his hair. A shame really because I like Big Audio Dynamite.Come back Mick we miss you!For fans only."
2,Slider not mappable + quality & compatibility issues,"I've had excellent luck in the past with PreSonus products. I love my Firebox and my Firepod! I had high expectations for this one as well. Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment.It has one fatal flaw: that big, lovely slider is *only* mappable to a track's fader. I'd been hoping to use it to control any automation parameter -- fader, send, plugin parameters, anything automatable. Nope, sorry! No can do. That was a deal-killer for me. My mixes do not depend on faders alone, thank you very much.The unit I got also had a quality issue: the pan knob was glitchy, and sometimes turning it just one click caused a huge jump.Finally, the thing's not compatible with Soundtrack Pro, which is a problem for me.It feels solid and well-constructed, so I'll give it two stars for that ... although I found the buttons a bit too hard to press. They'd get tiring after a while.Returned and regretted. Alas. It looked so nice."
1,DONT BUY IT!!!!!,"the product is fine, but there are to many installations problems!! you can make a search in google with words ""faderport installation problem"" and you fill find lot of sites and forum talking about that.After paying 200 usd (product + shipment) I cannot use this product because I cannot install it, there is a problem with UBS - drivers, Cannot resolve this problem! I tryied everything!!!!DO NOT BUY IT !!!!"
5,Very cute!,"I bought this for my sister who is sort of a pig scholar. She and I both love it! There are pictures, descriptions, anecdotes, etc. I learned a lot and she thinks it's just charming."
4,WHITE COLLAR CRIME AND TERROR!,"MERGER by Sanjay Sanghoee is a thriller set in 1980's America. It is written with depth and details. It has corporate crime,torture,murder,mystery,intrigue,greed,deceit,and the maneuvering of the underbelly of finance.If you have ever wondered about the finance world and their goings on this is a book for you to read.BE WARE it is a little terrifing from beginning to end,but a good read especially if you enjoy terror and a good thriller.This book was received for the purpose of review from the Bostick Communications and the author and details can be found at TOR,a Tom Doherty Associates Book and My Book Addiction and More."
2,Caution,"Caution to the buyer. The picture shows a whole canopy, but in reality, this product is just one side. Not even all sides. A person can buy all four sides for this price elsewhere."
3,Outdated and gathering dust,"So this was required for my yoga teacher training, but I wish I didn't still have it collecting dust on my shelf. Of course Donna Farhi is respected in this field and is amazing, I just wish I could sell back this book for more than 30 cents as has a very 1980's feel to it."
1,NOT Accurate,"I got this meter to replace my accu-chek so I could carry it with me. However, I find the glucose readings to be about 20% higher than my Accu-chek which has been exactly the same as my lab readings. When I checked the enclosed literature they even state there could be a plus or minus 20% difference which is another way of saying that it's not very accurate! That's a HUGE difference when your medication and/or diet has to be adjusted according to your readings!!!!"
2,Removed Part of the Product,"Item is OK. Seller is borderline. This kit comes with 10 test strips, a lancet, and the testing unit. They removed the test strips. I would not buy from this seller again."
1,no lancet device!,"without any indication to the contrary this meter came with no lancet device and the case is too small for the one i had, so i had to send it back, much to my chagrin."
1,Inaccurate,"This is the worst meter I have ever used. It is so inaccurate. If I test my blood sugar three times in a row, the number will very by as much as 30 points."
1,useless machine:too much blood needed for strips,"this machine, after 40 years of testing, has strips that require a BIG blob of blood. like the alliteration? what i hate is that it often does not draw that blood in, so i get an error on my test. this costs about a dollar a strip. Not a fan, to say the least. freesyle lite is much better."
3,Innovation is driving,"Innovation in almost every aspect of product development, design, marketing and distribution is driving new models for product naming and branding. you will find this volume interesting if you want to read in detail (few pictures) how things have been done in the past. David Shantz, WildOutWest"
5,Van Horn strikes gold!,"I must catch my breath before I begin... I am completely overwhelmed by this fine textbook. Did I say ""fine""--oh, how limited our language is. What Van Horn and his partner in scholarship have here done for the legal community is beyond measure. I never before imagined that real estate foreclosure could be at one time so interesting and so utterly entertaining. I attribute both to the eloquent style of the authors, who weave one of the finest paralegal tapestries to be found in ink. Once I picked this book up, I could not put it down (and my arms became very tired after the 22nd hour). I toast you, Grayson Van Horn. You have bestowed upon the world a rare piece of writing. I would read absolutely anything (at least the cover page of absolutely anything) you wrote; and not just because I am your son."
3,Not as good as it sounds,"I'm not a beginner when it comes to home exercise dvds but I'm not an expert either. As someone else has said on the board, there are 2 very annoying things about the dvd:One, the first 5 minutes of the program are advertisements that you cannot fast forward or skip through.Second, the breaks between each circuit is way too long. I barely broke a sweat and if they kept it going faster, it might feel like I was doing a cardio workout.On a plus side, the instructor explains proper form and goes through every move pretty thoroughly. Overall, it's great for someone who is new but I wouldn't say this workout will kick your butt."
2,commercials annoying and not high energy,"I guess I didn't read the other reviews that closely because the several minutes of inescapable commercials caught me by surprise (maybe because I've never seen that on an exercise DVD before?). That was super annoying -- I have a new baby and hardly any time to myself to exercise, and I don't need the exercise dvd itself to give me a reason NOT to exercise.On to the kickboxing -- I used to take Violet's classes regularly in Equinox gyms in NYC. She is amazing, high energy, with fast music and her class always attracts a group of people who are really motivated to be there and to work out. She will walk around and demonstrate moves right next to you if you are doing it wrong. The video unfortunately was slow in comparison, with boring music and no energy. I guess that if I could get through the ads in the beginning and then actually made myself do the whole workout, I would see some benefit, but it sits on the shelf, so it's not doing me any good."
5,"So adorable, even at this size!","Some people have been very upset at these smaller version dolls. But, they are so cute! They are the exact copy of the 18 inch doll. The charm to these little beauties is that you can play with them and take them with you wherever you go. The book is their size too, and little girls love this smaller size too because it is a perfect companion to the doll. How else could you place them into a child sized purse and go? They are very affordable too!"
4,Wide is not quite wide enough,"Got a 9 WIDE, but it wasn't wide enough. Great looking shoe, but wish it was wider. I have a lot of walking to do."
1,Piece of junk - save your money,"I was hoping to use this miter box for some cuts to build a jewelry box. I tried 3 different types of saws, and none of them worked well. There was also way too much play in the angle resulting in an awful cut. The saws also dug easily into the plastic. I wish there was some redeeming quality about this miter box, but it is a complete waste of money. I'll be throwing it out after only the first use."
5,HAPPY SON,I am not the person to write a review for this wrench as I bought it for a stocking stuffer for my son who is slowly but surely filling his toolbox for home and auto repair. He had hinted for wrenches but not knowing one from the other I purchased this one and he is thrilled with it. He said I did good!!
1,Not as pictured!,"Instead of sending this wall mount unit in the photo above, I recieved a flimsy, wobbly, cheap mirror with an accordion style arm that bends as if it were made of rubber. I called Amazon and was redirected (of course) to somewhere in the middle east where I desperately tried to explain this situation. I was sent a replacement, with my specific instructions not to send the same unit, please send the one in the photo, do not send one with an accordion arm. To no ones surprise, I now have two of these mirrors sitting in my closet. Great."
4,Decent selection / well-sized set,"A decent selection of small-headed screwdrivers. Two of these drivers worked well to extract the miniature screws from a broken Samsung Exhibit II smartphone. The smallest flatblade also fit the screws in my sunglasses.These tools are reasonably comfortable to work with (though the handles could be longer). The tip of the smallest flathead either deformed during my first set of usage or came that way-- still functional but clearly (if slightly) damaged. Based on reviews of competing products, miniature/jewelers screwdrivers aren't made of the hardened metal used in larger drivers.The color is nice, and Stanley generally makes good products. For the price, can't complain. Recommended."
4,Different way to remember medications,"I have really enjoyed going through this book. I have been to two sessions with the authors and they have come up with a new and different way to remember key things about all the medications that will be on the NCLEX. This book covers drug categories, side effects, adverse reactions, drug-drug/food interactions and goes over the high alert medications. If you have trouble memorizing words, I recommend this book because it uses words and pictures and even songs. It's different, but helpful."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This movie starts really good, at least on the first episode. But the other two thirds show what a piece of crap this movie is. If you are looking for serious info about the bermuda triangle, try getting it from a book, but stay away from this movie. About 50% of the scenes are entirely focused on the face, literally, of a bunch of bad actors. 5% of the scenes focus on the bermuda triangle and its real implications. What a disappointment!"
2,A certain lack of communication,This sinister triangular ocean in wild commotion - a pity it cannot speak.
3,The Triangle,"Item arrived in good condition and on time. A good science-fiction effort, which I liked a lot, black holes of time and space, adventure off into the Sargasso Sea to track down mysteries - worth seeing.Linda Sheean"
4,Worth carrying the half kilo,"An excellent example of Lonely Planet's output. Detailed, accurate and helpful, the only real critisism is that itdoesn't really reccommend places to go - you have to know the things you want to do. A book for using while traveling round - not for armchair browsing. Their web site is impressive too. (www.lonleyplanet.com)"
1,BAD LIGHT,"This lamp arrived damages with the shade broken off of the support rod. I had to tap and drill a repair. The advertisement states its rated for 100W and the instructions state no more than 60W. The construction is poor and the base is a joke. I do not recommend this lamp; although now that I have it, I will use it until it breaks again."
3,Serviceable but slipshod,"If you like Eric and Beth and Kory, you may want to know what's been happening to them since the last installment in the series. Go ahead and read this one, then. But get it at the library, or wait for the paperback. This book is not as good as it could have been.Part of it is me; I'm finding Lackey a less compelling read in the last couple of years. But this one is a bit more unstructured than usual - the story really didn't hang together very well."
1,No drawings makes this book useless,"The Da Vinci notebooks are one of the most amazing works of literature out there. The sketches alone are amazing. Unfortunately, this e-book lacks the drawings, so it's reduced to a series of footnotes and comments about drawings that are not there, making this utterly useless."
4,A beautiful story,"Barbara Hannay writes lovely Australian romances that are enjoyable quick reads.This is an emotionally-charged story about two people finding each other through tragedy. A tragedy that threatened to cause conflict and hatred.The author has a great appreciation for the Australian Outback, and she writes believable stories that are mercifully free of the stereotypes and clichés non-Australian authors tend to attribute with the country.I would recommend this story for anyone looking for a heart-warming holiday read."
3,Swashbuckling in Society,"An adventure story, written in 1894, it deals with (fictional) European politics and the succession of Ruritania's King. (Zenda is the name of a castle, and has nothing to do with the video game Zork.) Still, this was great *older* fiction. I like it much more than Dickens, more than Melville, and more than Twain. The target audience appears to be young men or teenage boys, but I'm past that and more picky about what makes a novel. Reviews here convinced me to read, and please don't take this 'mere' three and a half stars (rounded down) to mean it isn't a good book. If I had a son, I'd recommend it to him!Also note the sequel isRupert of Hentzauwritten in 1898 by Anthony Hope, and if you are actually buying these in physical form and not downloading for free on the kindle, go with a combined edition of both books --The Prisoner of Zenda and Rupert of Hentzau (Penguin Classics)."
3,Heaven doesn't always make the right men kings,"The Prisoner of Zenda is one of my favorite old movies--the Ronald Colman version, of course, not the pale Stewart Granger copy--and maybe it's because I saw the movie before I read the book, but this is one of the few instances where I prefer the movie to the book. In comparison to the cardboard, melodramatic characters in the book, the movie characters seem like real people with real motivations. I've seen Anthony Hope's books described as schoolboy adventure stories, and I think that's about right. There's not a lot of depth of emotion in the story and Rudolf is an impossibly heroic figure, but the story is still a good adventure. The movie allows Flavia to be a bit more heroic than Hope does, but the love story between Flavia and Rudolf is still a sigh-worthy one--with or without Ronald Colman."
2,Not quite what I needed,"I was hoping it would work in an old manual machine I have, but it does not,"
4,Interesting approach,Lee Strobel has a lot of good information and a good story of his search. If you believe in a Creator it will be good support.
1,reinforcing misinformation,"If you are looking to reinforce your existing theological beliefs then you'll love this movie. If you are looking for accurate information then move on, it isn't here.The movie is full of the usual mistakes and misunderstandings of evolution. Particularly ""irreducable complexity"" which has been totally discredited and yet plays a major roll in the arguments of this movie.I have no doubt I'll get nothing but ""not usefull"" reviews but oh well I tried."
5,Incredible,"Great investigative writer, intriguing topic in DVD format, highly suggested for intellegent, open minded adults and teens."
4,Very Informative and Scientific,"This video is very thorough in discussing several different scientific thoughts on the origin of creation. It also has good commentary from Lee about why he went on his search.I would recommend this to middle schoolers on up. But if you show it to teens, do not show it all at once because it is pretty in depth in terms of scientific discussion."
4,"cute, but...","portable size is a great fit in the bag. did not think ahead of how thin and narrow the tape ruler would be, convenient for small measurements but not for ones vertical or longer, ruler is not able to hold straight for too much length. just a heads up."
5,Favorite!,"I actually really LOVED this book. I didn't really like the first book in the Seer series. I thought the characters weren't well developed, and there were SO many editing problems. HOWEVER, at the end of the first book, the author hooked me.SO, I turned right around and read the entire series. Book 2: Last Dance is my absolute favorite!!! I love the story line...it kept me on the edge of my seat. I would definitely recommend it - EVEN if you didn't like the first one!"
4,murder in belleville,"I was introduced to Cara Black's Amy LeDuc, 'Murder in the Marais on Nook, bought because it was inexpensive. As I followed her thru those ancient streets with ancient troubles now new troubles, and, in spite of violence and some hard-to-believe physical feats on Amy's part, she took me to Paris.The main reason I read detective novels with foreign venues is that these somewhat down and out seedy heroes take me into the streets and show me actual life and customs in these places. Cara and Amy do not disappoint.I have now read Murder in Belleville (which I had to buy on Amazon's used books because for some reason it is not available on Nook) and am preparing to read Murder in the Sentier.Enjoy, baton rouge"
2,"Not worth it, destroys furniture",I bought these for my flat screen tv stand and my flat screen tv.I did not know how they would clip to it but I never thought screws. I did not mind drilling screws into my new and expensive stand but what about the tv? I was not going to put screws into my flat screen tv. I guess I will have to look elsewhere. I used them on her furniture but still did not like drilling screws into all of her furniture.
3,You knew what was going to happen.,"I gave this book three stars because I basically knew what was going to happed after the first few chapters. The main character, Jason, was a quiet boy who kept to himself and who didn't like the spotlight on him at all. Even in class when the teacher called on him. He liked little kids a lot, he liked how they acted. Jason was acused of murdering a young girl who he liked to play with every once in a while. Since he was the last person to be seen with her, they pointed the finger at him.I could have given this book a lower rating but the book was exciting in a way that made me never put it down until the book was done. So thats why I gave this book three stars."
3,What's the point?,"I dare you to find a concert piece written in the key of G. Let alone, a decent clarinet for $U.S.450. I'm sorry I'll pass, but I guess it's cool cor a novelty."
3,not for the smallest ears...otherwise very good headphones,"These headphones are easy to insert by squishing them a little and letting them expand in your ears. The sound is fine. I use them for listening to podcasts, so I can't vouch for how they sound with various types of music. They are effective at keeping out ambient noise.My problem with them is idiosyncratic...I evidently have the smallest ears of an adult ever because I can't find a pair of in ear headphones that don't hurt my ears after about 15 minutes. Other than that, I would have given it a 5 rating."
2,"Okay fit, terrible sound","These earbuds fit comfortably about half the time. I think it will just be different for each person.They do block out background noise, but they make my music sound awful. Every song sounds tinny and small. The radio in my bathroom gets better sound that these earbuds. It was very disappointing because I bought them specifically to get a richer sound with my iPod and instead, I got the exact opposite."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased these optimistically; I needed a new pair of headphone that would fit into my ears and not fall out. After reading reviews, I felt that these would be perfect because they supposedly conform to your ears well. For the first week they do wonderfully, but the ""marshmallow"" material began degrading very quickly. I use my headphones everyday, and these just don't pull their weight. I have worn them for two weeks and that's all they're good for. I am forced to purchase new headphones if I want to continue listening to music without the headphones falling out."
3,Interesting read as long as you don't throw it out the window,"This book is basically 'how to spam' for newbies; or 'how to analyze spam', if you prefer. In any case, it's for technical users. If you are looking for a novel, check ""Spam Kings"" instead.Anyway, this book is written by a spammer, which (quite often) tries to justify himself as being a ""legimate spammer"" (meaning that he will send the stuff even if he knows it's overpriced, the spam was not opt-in, etc). This becomes quite annoying after a while, specially because he says ""I don't care if you want to receive the spam or not; you are going to receive it"". Thanks man.As for a short advice on whether you should buy this book: If you are a hacker wanna be, or have an interest in security, it's a decent read."
1,"Good video and sound, but no closed captions","I , like many thousands , like the Morse TV serie very much.But you must understand English like spoken in England, becauseto my amazamente they are without closed caption.And even for a person that speaks and hears very wellthere are moments in which the closed captions could be of help.A Morse fan"
4,Serious but still readable,"This is a short book covering the life of Charles Darwin. It's a well written book with sufficient detail to be a serious study, but not over blown to make if a difficult read. It also gives us a history of the evolution of ""evolution"" as well as the sense of inquiry into the natural world that prevailed in Darwin's century.Cyril Aydon writes both the history of Darwin's prolific publications and his life as an English Gentleman. Given the multitude of influences and priviledges Darwin possesed, he truly was an ""outlier""."
5,Best lunch box ever,I bought this for my husband to use for work. He loves it. We actually had the first one stolen so I had to search for another one just like it to replace the old one. Would highly recommend.
5,The Mech Cartoon from the 80s,The complete series and then some. In Great sound and better picture quality. Not a bad way to prepare for the Movie Trilogy in the works. The best Robot/mech cartoon series of the 80s.
4,Robotech Complete Collection,"It's an excelente purchase, but I expected more from the remasterization, still it's an awesome adquisition and I've only seen 1 saga."
3,"Good collection, but Spanish audio is not the one as originally aired","Great collection. Sounds better than previous DVD releases. Although I was really dissapointed that the the Spanish audio track is not the original done in Mexico as when aired back in 1980s, this dub was the most popular. Current dub in Spanish is of great quality but not the original."
4,great experience,I bought this as a christmas present for my boyfriend. Since there is still a few weeks to go before it gets opened I can not review the product itself... but i received great service. I live in canada & purchased it in the states. I received it quickly. It arrived almost a week earlier than the website said it would... so woohoo! Merry Christmas!
3,awkward confrontation,"Having struggled with poverty for most of her career, Mary Lou had become somewhat bitter by the time this show was recorded. She was jealous of Marian's success and gives her a hard time here. These are two of my favorite piano players and I found it somewhat painful to listen to the tension between the bubbly, obsequious disciple and the querulous master. Marian doesn't get to play much but there are some nice duos by Mary Lou and her bassist Ronnie Boykins. Mary Lou is heard on a high quality, well tuned and well recorded piano, which wasn't always the case for her."
3,Not enough on FSBO,"I thought the book was informative, however it didn't have enough on selling your house on your own. And some of the material was a bit dated. Overall though, a useful source for the first time home seller."
4,Mesmerizing and fascinating,"This, like all Gedge's novels, is truly an evocative and beguiling work of fiction. The fiction is so intimately interwoven with fact that it is impossible to tell where fiction and non-fiction meet. That is the earmark of the very best novel, in my opinion. Although this is not my favorite of her Egyptian novels (Scroll of Saqqara is the very best), I wish that I could have the delight of going back and reading it again for the first time. I hope Gedge will continue to write on the Egyptian theme and I will anxiously await her next novel. Good reading!"
5,No issues at all!,"I had no problems getting the music onto my iTunes. So if that's what's preventing you from buying an imported cd, it probably won't be a problem for you. The music's great and the money's worth it!"
2,CHEAP CASE,Real cheap.. Broke on my real quick the clip was cheap and the case was really cheap... But for the price you get what you pay for... Would never purchase again.
1,The case does not work any all!,Seller should not put this item for sell any more because the case does not fit iPod nano at all.
4,Good for the Money,"The Enviracaire monitor comes with a triple A battery installed. Just cut open the clamshell packaging, remove the unit, and pull out the plastic tab to engage the battery.Numbers on this unit are easy to read and it functions silently.The humidity in our house dips and rises to extremes so we like to keep track of humidity levels on multiple levels.This unit mostly coincides with other measuring instruments we have, some of which are analog.I think the temperature reading on the Enviracaire is a degree or two over the actual and the humidity readout might be a percent or two under the actual humidity. However, the readouts are always consistent, so the discrepancies, if any, should be no problem.We like our unit; it's small and inconspicuous. Keeping the humidity low in summer reduces allergengs, viruses, and bacteria in the air."
5,"simple and nice, cheap and very useful","I have been looking for Humidity/Temperature for long long timeBelieve it or not, they usually goes between 40-50 range in retailThis one is very good price and it does its jobit doesnt have light up for screen but I didn't expect that muchback of this unit is not flat so it is not easy to stick to the wallbut it is small enough to place anywhereI bought 2 of these and compare those 2 after few minute later out of boxthey both come out same number for temp and humidityso at least no calibration differenceit is small and simple and do its jobwill buy again if needed"
3,Accurate temp but the humidity is off,"Just chiming in to back up what others have said: the temp reading is pretty accurate but the humidity reading is not. In my case it's at least consistently wrong by about -10% so I just do the math when I look at it. Not ideal, so if humidity matters I'd look for something else. On the positive side it is well built, compact, and easy to read."
4,"Cheap, not sure how accurate though.","For the cost it is the best deal I think I have found.Not sure how accurate it is though. I have a more expensive humidity meter and they are about 5-7% different when placed beside each other.Not sure which one is incorrect.I use this one during the winter and keep the room it is in at 50% humidity level with my humidifier.This is a great thing to have when the heat is on during the winter.Sinus problems, respiratory issues, and dry skin are just a few of the things that happen in dry environments.The printed meter on the unit explains what is a good level of humidity is for different situations."
5,A good place to start,"This inexpensive DVD is a very good place to start learning about how to develop your communication skills in any relationship and to start to get yourself straightened out.It's short - about 30 minutes or so - and this means it has the right level of detail for beginners and will hold people's interest. It's an animation which means it's good to show to everyone, including kids (I'd say 11 years +).The language used is not hard for non-native English speakers with a reasonable understanding of English. The technical words are always written on the screen, explained verbally and shown in the animation as pictures. All the first concepts you need to know about starting Transactional Analysis are there.If you want to know the first steps in TA, and reducing the burn and friction in your relationships with colleagues, family and friends this DVD is ""as cheap as chips"". You have to ask, ""Why wait?"""
2,Boring & Slow,"You would be much better off buying I'm OK, You're OK. They refer to it a few times. If you take away the unhelpful and poor quality animation, and 30 second pauses you would be left with a 10 minutes of semi helpful audio. It would be a much better video if they had actual video of situations and conversations between people. The few interactions between people were helpful to understand the different rolls."
5,Another great read by Carol Hacker!,"I enjoyed this book because like her other books, it offers practical advice for the manager or supervisor. It's got lots of practical information that applies to any business organization. A hundred or so people were interviewed for the book and that in itself adds a lot of credibility to the topic of improving employee morale. Those interviewed shared their perspectives on how they keep people contented in working for them. The author wove her own management experience throughout the book. I highly recommend this guide to managing morale."
2,Yesterday's Promise,"In this novel were blood is not thicker than water, Rogan Chantry finds himself in a fierce battle with several relatives, and tribes in South Africa over diamonds, gold, and a treasure map.I found it difficult to have any sympathy for any of the characters involved. They all seemed to be very greedy fortune hunters. Even the main character, Rogan showed few Christian values. He was willing to leave his love, Evy Varley behind in search for his riches.At certain points the book was very interesting and quite a page turner and other times the novel was bogged down with too many characters and didn't seem to have much relevance to the story. In the books defense, this was book two in a series, and maybe those characters had more relevance in the first book."
3,Yesterday's Promise,"Yesterday's Promise by Linda Lee Chaikin is book 2 of the East of the Sun Series. Part mystery, part adventure and part romance this book set in the late 1800's in England and Africa follows Rogan Chantry and Evy Varley as they discover who killed Rogan's Uncle Henry and Rogan tracks the Kimberly Black Diamond.I wanted to like this book. It is the style of book that I enjoy. But to be completely honest I had a very difficult time getting through it. It never grabbed my attention. The book was fine but not memorable."
5,Great Series,"These series are great and the seller was a wonderful, the book was in great condition and the delivery time was fast."
4,Nice Christmastime book,"A nice read with sweet stories perfect for reading around Christmastime. I liked that they were all connected, but I liked the first one the best, probably because it was written by one of my favorite authors, Colleen Coble."
5,Sweet...,"Novella. I love the way this book weaves the story. It was fun reading it. I couldn't wait until the end so I could find out how they were going to tie everyone together.The story of a broken family torn apart by poverty, but then, brought back together by Love."
3,eh,"I might've set up my expectations too high for this book.I had just finished reading His Marriage to Remember by the same author and that book was just too good.*spoiler alert*This on the other hand, was just okay. It was enjoyable, but there wasn't any real conflict except the fact that he only showed interest at her to get back at his brother. At times, I wanted to scream at the heroine because it was so obvious, but being that she's been in love with him since high school, so I can sort of understand...I think the problem in the book was that you knew everything would be all right at the end (I know it's Harlequin and we always get our HEA, but I just couldn't care enough about the characters to worry).Still it was a decent story, but don't read it after His Marriage to Remember."
3,Please Note: This is NOT a Webkinz Signature Panda!,"My 7 yr old grandson wanted the Webkinz ""Signature"" panda. The price on that panda was way more than I wanted to spend on a stuffed toy, but this ""Signature"" panda was listed with items that people who looked at the Webkinz Signature Panda also looked at--along with many other Webkinz products. I thought the only difference was the size and price. I did not notice it said ""Wild Republic Signature Panda"". I was so proud to finally be able to give it to my grandson today because he had been waiting so patiently for it, then I noticed the tag was brown and did not have a rainbow colored ""W"" on it. I felt awful when I realized my mistake.Then, tonight I received an email from Amazon requesting I rate this transaction. In the email link they even called it a Webkinz product.It is a lovely stuffed panda, very soft and plush, legs are weighted with pellets and it sits up well. (The one I received had two left back feet which I thought was kind of funny.)"
4,I really liked this book.,"This was very interesting. I like the way the sections were written because it made it easy to pick a section to read. I do wish that there had been more on serial killers, but I enjoyed the book all the same."
4,Spinning a good yarn,"Here's a book with all the fun facts about stories we've all heard- but they're all rolled into one entertaining volume of things that make you go ""huh"". The author's tone is conversational and she sounds more like a conspiratorial camp counselor weaving a good campfire story than a stodgy classroom professor. Each chapter is a quick, light read so it's a good book to put out on the coffee table or place strategically in that little room in which no one admits they read... and if, by chance, you happen to actually be a camp counselor, here's your ammunition!!!"
4,A fun Victorian era romp,"This novel is a adaption of animated work created by Buffy fan favorite Amber Benson.Set in Victorian England, Will and Tamara Swift fight the forces of evil in their role as Protectors of Albion. The ""Ghosts of Albion"" are historical figures fromEngland's past returned such as Lord Nelson who aid and support the brother and sister duo. There was really nothing to dislike, the setting, story and characters have been seldom used in other works to make the whole fresh and fun to read. I think most people will find something to enjoy in this novel, besides the fact it was co-written by Amber Benson."
1,Don't expect much!,"This book is shockingly boring! Even worse is that I had to order it and wait for it. The setting is back when women wore very uncomfortable dresses, and marriages were arranged. The only bearable character in the book is the main one. She isn't a ""typical"" quiet girl, and their family has a secret history of a demon fighting order. Her brother and his fiancee are the most annoying and useless characters in the entire book. After reading the first Myth Hunters book, I noticed the authors tendency to use weak and spineless men as characters. Anyways, the story crawls along with old-fashioned drama that doesn't make sense and I never could stand to finish the book, although i did try. It drags on and on with no relief other than to close the cover. Mr. Golden should stick to modern settings that his writing excels in. I recommend the Buffy books instead. Maybe the Myth Hunters if you can ignore the old-fashioned tediousness and have an interest in gods,stories, and myths."
2,okay,"Good shape, came on time it was good. Story was boring. Barely made it through. Just not what i was looking for."
5,Of Lasting Value,"This is a CD of inspiring, melodic songs played and sung impeccably, completely standing alone as its own genre in the world of popular music. Some have compared it to Renaissance, the 1970s English band with Annie Haslam, but it's not very similar. This CD is romantic and emotional, and stands up on numerous repeated listenings. It can move you to a surprising degree, with unexpected suddenness. It has been a treasured CD in my collection for a decade now. One can listen to it closely and it is intense and passionate, yet one can also put it on in the background and is lovely and unobtrusive. My favorites are the most dramatic songs musically and in lyrics: ""Take Me As I Am"", ""Bury My Lovely"", ""Eyes of Mercy"", ""Paths of Desire"" and ""Always""."
5,The Best Project You'll Ever Be Involved In!,"Real short and sweet:I have a CD collection which is massive and spans the gamut from Robert Johnson to Bach to Iron Maiden and everyone in between. Of all these CD's, I can fit into one hand the CD's that I can just press PLAY and ABSORB every single note from the first to last note. This CD is one of them.A haunting, eerily peaceful, gifted and ingenius timeless classic.If I hit the lottery, the best I could do for the world is to buy everyone a copy of this CD along with Over The Rhine's ""Good Dog Bad Dog"" : )Peace, michael yolch"
5,Beautiful music by an unappreciated band...,"I discovered this group when I was reading reviews for Grey Eye Glance's CD Eventide (review to come). I took a chance and bought their CD, it was a joy to listen to. Mary Fahl's voice is beautiful, deep and evocative. I especially enjoyed the songs Be My Hero, Return to Me, and my favorite, Paths of Desire. If you are into Grey Eye Glances and like Sarah Mclachlan and others like her, you will really get into this group. It's too bad they were dropped from their record label a while back, they certainly deserved better. A great CD of music to read (or write) an epic fantasy by, and the lyrics of Julie Flanders and Emil Adler will mesmerize you.Cockatiel1"
5,wow,"It is amazing to hear music like this. It isn't very often that lyrics and music come together to form something this wonderful, but this group manages to strike a perfect balance between the two; haunting melodies stir your soul while impassioned words whirl through your mind. wow."
3,Good,"Nothing new under the sun, but a good sampling of the story of the music. Liquid sound and relaxing, none boring moment and the feeling this album will remain in my collection."
1,Disappointed,"I was looking for a book to describe a structure, do's and don'ts, and general guidance for developing a business oriented mentoring relationship/program. I found the book lacked any specificity to the business world as opposed to general living. Worse, I found that by reading the first sentence of each paragraph, I got the idea, rather than spending time going into each repetitive example. On the chance I was too negative about the text, I loaned it to an associate who is heavily involved with mentoring and he also found the book to be redundant with rather obvious recommendations. Purchase another text if you are looking for a guide to mentoring in the business world."
5,Donkey kong is back!!!,"I actually have this game on three different systems. The nes,atari,and on the gamecube and i love them all. It is a classic one that came out in the arcades and since then it has been a great hit. This is where mario came from on the atari. He was the one that had to rescue peach from donkey kong at the top of each level. U r supposed to avoid getting hit by the falling objects and try to climb latters at the same time. The one on the atari is a little different but it has the same purpose. This is a great classic game everyone remembers."
3,DOES NOT FIT 2008 JEEP WRANGLER JK UNLIMITED,"This was a nice shift knob but it will not fit a 2008 Wrangler or at least the 07-10 JK...JK's need a 5/8"" smooth hole and this only had a 3/8""-1/2"" smooth hole."
4,Traditional Hootie,"This compelation of songs is good for anyone who is a traditional Hootie fan. I would have liked if they had included some of the ""less traditional"" songs that they tend to perform in concert. For anyone who knows the typical radio songs and enjoys singing along to them, I would think they would like this DVD."
3,It's Ho humm,"It works, that is to say it swivels, and mover up and down. The problem is that the mechanism is really loose, and the trailer is able to shift back and forth easily. I would pass this one up and buy a better jack if it were me."
3,Pretty but flawed,"This bottle has a pretty color and does come with a drizzler cap (which isn't mentioned anywhere). All blown glass has defects, and I know this as I create stained glass items. Sadly, maybe partly due to the terrible packaging on Amazon's part, but also due to manufacturer flaws, this item came to me too badly flawed. This would have cut a person's hand if they ran it on the outside of the glass. That is a manufacturing problem. Amazon's lax packaging probably dislodged the thin glass on one side of a bubble, and that was that. It would've happened eventually though. Small bubbles are normal. Large ones may become a problem, so look well. One doesn't want glass in one's oil!Amazon is reshipping this item, so that is good. Amazon is usually good about defective items. It is just hard to sometimes communicate what is wrong to some of their people in Asia. *sigh*"
1,pathetic,"i dun even feel like giving her the only star, just because they need to fill in that column, anyway the star go to the production team! for the effort! coco lee is fading"
4,good historical fiction,"My son, who is six, checked this out of his school library. It is a good, instructive book. My son learned about the Gold Rush from this book. The reading level was a bit above his level, but he could read most of it. Probably more of a second-grade book than for first-graders. A good buy for a gift, especially with some gold paint, so you can get rocks and paint them gold and recreate some scenes from the book (like my son did)."
2,ok but 5th symphony sounds labored,the 4th is okay but the 5th stinks of laboredness. woundn't recommend unless you really like the 4th.
2,"Wipes good for hands, not baby butts","These wipes are too thin-the Huggies brand is much better. The Pampers wipes are very wet and stick together too much, making a one handed operation difficult. However, these wipes are great for using as hand/face cleaners due to all these negative reasons-they are very wet and make cleaning sticky hands easy and you don't have to worry about anything (ehem) seeping through the thin wipe."
1,Not good,"I got these wipes because I really like the diapers. However, as nice as these wipes are in construction, the fact that the poop doesn't stick to them means you end up using abut 10 more wipes that you should. I switched back to Huggies brand and am using many less wipes to clean up the poo."
4,Great!,Very good! Really enjoy this series. Quality of playback was very good. ... .... .... ... .. ... ... ...
4,Decent Show To Watch,Out of the shows on tv now this one is one of the ones that is decent to watch. Going to watch an epsiode I missed tonight.
5,Great!,Great episode! I just love Covert Affairs! I am now all caught up and can't wait to keep watching! A must watch for sure!
4,Sad to see Simon go!,"I really liked this episode, the only thing that made it bittersweet is that Simon won't be back! I had really gotten to like him, and the dynamic that existed between him and Annie. I'm really going to miss that storyline, but it will be exciting to see where the season goes from here. I think Covert Affairs really picked up their game in Season 3."
5,Wrong color but I liked the color I recieved so I kept them.,"This is my third pair of Allen Edmonds shoes and all are of the finest quality and fit well. However, I ordered the mocha and brown suede but I received the all leather brown ones. I liked the way the brown leather ones looked so I kept them. I wanted to order the mocha suede ones but they are now out of stock. I guess it wasn't meant to be. All in all it's a great shoe."
3,"Amusing, but nothing special","The story was OK with some decent twists, but nothing special. I liked the main character but I can only say it was OK."
2,Not interested in this toy!,"My 3 year old and 7 year old tried this out the first day, but then it just became this thing I trip over! It is not that exciting for them! Look for a more challenging one or one that you have to do something like move a ball or something I thought I saw one like that."
5,good for 2 1/2 to 4 1/2 year olds!,"My 4 year old loves his board. I can really see a improvement in his balance and stability since he started playing with the balance board. It doesn't seem to state any weight limits so I had my 7 year old and then my husband try it out with no issues. The plywood is about an 3/4 of an inch thick and is reinforced by the bottom rocker. After finding a Phillips screwdriver, putting it together is simple with its 6 screws and taking less than 10 mins to complete. Board is about 2 feet across and about a foot wide which is very generous to the toddler and preschool age ranges."
3,Fun for a little while,"My girls (4 and 6) lost interest in this pretty quickly. It's sturdy enough and they enjoyed it for a little while, but I don't think we got enough use out of it to make it a worthwhile purchase."
5,Great for balance and play,"This is a really simple ""toy"". It's a board with a curved base so that it rocks in one direction. The goal is to stand on the board an balance such that it's level. Really not that complicated, but the kids love it! They will balance and read a book or watch TV or play king of the mountain. It is short lived in that it's 5min here and 10min there but it hasn't been pushed under the sofa or in a closet in weeks. My two boys are also using it for other stuff as a train tunnel and see if you can keep the ball on the top by rocking the board back and forth so it's gone outside of it's intended function.It's well built, easy to put together (4 screws in pre-drilled holes) and my boys have really engaged with it. I'd recommend it!"
3,"A Prometheus in every age, on every block and instrument","This is a misconceived CD with the obvious focus on Prometheus through the ages. This of course implies that Beethoven and Nono would share somehow similar views or inhabit some common conceptual space, when nothing could be further from the truth. But Abbado has been a devoted Nono colleage conducting much of his music during his lifetime, when Abbado was hardly known in the early Seventies. Here Abbado has assembled a formidable cast for the excerpts from ""Prometeo"", Suzanne Otto is a wonderful singer of new works. This was the first recording of Nono's"" Prometeo"" which still has documentary value in that the only other recording is by Matzmacher who although less informed than Abbado still brings a precision and clarity where it is needed. Scriabin I don't know, his concepts of spirituality finds a use someplace, but I prefer just listening. Argerich is always a compelling performer no matter what she touches."
3,Very Small Refrigerators ONLY!,"Very Small Refrigerators ONLY!This inverter will not run a standard refrigerator or microwaves, not even close. So when they say it will run a ""small refrigerator"" they really mean one of those little soft drink coolers. It won't run a standard size ""small"" refrigerator. I also tried to start a swamp cooler with this inverter and it couldn't even start the fan. The peak watts needed to get it going just arn't there."
5,Rather unique,"When I seen this I knew I had to get it/To hear those lines as Hov can only spit it/And at the price they were offering I was like ""all right, I'm with it/If you want to hear that real hip hop go out with dough and spend it"
4,Works well for me,"I mainly use this at my desk at work. I can play my music without it bothering my co-workers and not have to use headphones. The battery life seems pretty good, but I am planning on buying the adapter as well. I have enjoyed it so far and have no complaints."
1,Travel Doc 900 Nothing But Trouble!,"I purchased a Travel Doc 900 speaker and have had nothing but trouble with the product. When I turn the unit off it stays on and burns thru batteries. I probably have wasted 16 batteries until I discovered the problem. Creative Labs refuses to take it back or give me a credit-I bought an Ipod speaker from another company that works much better. I will never buy another Creative Labs product. By comparison, Logitech (for mouses) treats their customers much better!"
3,Fact ot Fiction?,"Is this book fact or fiction? You can try forever and never really know. One thing we do know is Ted Kaczynski wrote a book. Before it was published, he pulled it away. He didnt see eye to eye with the publisher. This is the ONLY book when it is published that may answer all the questions....Lets get that book in print!"
1,Want a book about Unabomber or the Author?,"See the title? Well with this book you get to know an awful lot (repeatedly) about how the author new the forests betterthan the unabomber...ad nauseam. This is a book about the author, about 85% and very little about Ted Kaczynski. When you have tired for the umpteenth time of how but for the author we may never have found ""Ted's Secret Cabin"" you will have to seek out other books to find out about the unabomber.Is it me but why have the last two books I bought from American authors (last one supposed to be about Tim McVeigh) all about themselves and not the subject matter? Very very tedious book and to be avoided if you want to know much about the unabomber but great if you want to learn how skillful and terrific the author is."
5,It's Never Too Late to Learn,"Since I'm nearing retirement, I shouldn't have need for motivational materials. However, this one gave me a new, and effective way, to think about my ""life after retirement"" and how I want to handle it. The ironic thing is that I recommended Mariah as a speaker for our college undergraduates and then read the book because I was impressed with her presentation. Yes, the book is relevant for all ages."
1,"Some good films, very poor reprints","I bought this collection six years ago, through Amazon. Because of all the films, I'm just getting around to viewing some of them.I just attempted to watch ""Letter of Introduction"", which shares a disc with ""Love Affair"" (another great film), and although ""Letter of Introduction"" is a sweet ""B"" film, it is clear it was a copy from a tape, but the story jumps from the middle to the end, back to the middle, and what really caps it - after ""The End"", it jumps back to the middle.There are some good little movies in this collection, but because some are so good, I wouldn't spend my money on it but would look for a better made collection.I bought my set from ""Crazyapecom"", who no longer have any for sale and since it is six years out, I have no rights to ask for a better copy or even for a better copy of ""Letter of Introduction""."
5,SO much fun!,"Don't think too much about it -- just listen, get up and shuffle your feet around! I hope a new generation will rediscover these gems."
1,Such a chore,I was very disappointed with this product. It has no power to speak of and doesn't keep its charge for any real helpful length of time.
2,Two Stars. Not a Fraction More.,"The best I can say is that this book looks like it has a lot of information.But what good is it if you have to wade through words ""up to here"" just to get at it? Do they pay these guys by the word?It's just not an efficient book.If I couldn't teach any better than this I'd get another job."
2,The book is tough & stuff not well explained,"This is the only book, I can find for windows network programming. Unfortunately, stuff here is not well explained & if you are not a expert, do not expect to learn network programming from this book. Atleast not without a great deal of pain."
5,Yummy Honey Sticks,"Bought a few honey sticks at a local Farmers Market, that was all it took to hook me on those sweet straws of goodness. I found them on Amazon for a much better price and have enjoyed using the honey in my morning smoothies. I will definately be back for more"
5,Awesome Mouse,"I've had this mouse for a year now and its still going strong and its definately an awesome mouse. I use it for gaming and never have any problems. Never ever skips and within 2-3 feet it never loses connection. It's the best optical of all my friends and they have a few nice wired and wireless ones. Never experienced any of the previously listed review's problems. Mines lasted 48 hours without a recharge and worked great though I usually put it in the cradle after every use. Great product, I'm guessing the previous two reviewers bought it used or refurbished which is a bad move and it'd be wrong to rate this mouse low based on a not so mint product."
3,ok but you can do better,"I looked at the mmf 2.1 at my local hiFi shop and It is ok for a $300 turntable and I might have bought it but they happened to have the Goldring GR 1.2 (Rega P2 with a Goldring electra cartridge)which normally costs $475 on sale for $300. After hearing the Goldring I could tell it was a far seperior product. The Goldring tracks better due to it's Rega RB250 tonearm and elektra cartridge which has an eliptical stylus as aposed to the conicle stylus on the elan cartridge that the mmf 2.1 includes. The Goldring also seemed to be made better (smoother motor and bearings,MDF platter that absorbs vibration).If your on a tight budget the mmf 2.1 is ok but if you have an extra $175 or you find a turntable like the Goldring GR 1.2 on sale you can get a much better turntable."
4,Love!!!,I cannot stop playing this season's dvd's. Arrived on time with disc in tact. I love this season I just wish the others would come out.
3,Not as great as I once remembered the show.,The shows were okay. Not as funny as I remembered the show to be. That maybe because it was in its first season but its okay ordered it 8 + months ago and i have yet to watch three shows yet.
3,Living Single,some of the DVDs would freeze I have cleaned my dvd player and put in other dvds put tthse keep freezing I am disatisfied with the quality of the dvd
4,Love Living Single... But Where's MARTIN,I'm all for Living Single (my Tivo can show and prove) BUT... MARTIN is one of the ULTIMATE BEST COMEDY SHOW EVER! When Is it coming out on DVD? Does anyone have the information on this??? I hope something surfaces soon!
3,I request Martin,Im not gonna disrespect the show at all but if it wasnt for Martin this show wouldnt have lasted as long as it did the reason why they put it on on thursday at 830 for so many years is because martin Had unlimited ratings it proved its point after martin got cancled the show couldnt keep its strong edge it move to diffrent days time slots etc till finally it faulterd itself even new york undercover fell off after he got cancled it was the same method they(Fox Network) was tryin to do with the cedric the entrtainer show Playing it after the Berine Mac show to get smooth easy ratings didnt work for him though. BUT sorry ladies great wholesome friendly show and all but I just dont understand why theres not a dvd season set out for this man yet I think once martin goes to DVD it gonna sell just as much as the Chapelle shows success PEOPLE REQUEST MARTIN ON DVD NOW!
5,Living Single Down Under,"At last Living Single Series 1 on DVD.Believe it or not they used to air this series in Australia. I used to rush home from school to make it just on time. I recorded all episodes which had aired in Sydney Australia (which was many years ago. I had 4 tapes in total and can now only find one.To have this box set is unbelievable. I enoyed each episode better than the last and can watch them repeatedly.I think the whole cast was perfect; inclduing Queen Latifah who was cast as Kadija. Her performance which was referred to as ""horrid"" in the previous review is harsh and obviously misguided. Oh well, everyone is entitled to their own opinion!!!If you are interested in a nice laugh then this series will not fail you as you are guaranteed a laugh from each episode.The sexual tension between Kyle and Maxine is truly hilarious. The character Synclair is adorable and funny!This purchase will not disappoint you."
5,YES!!!,It's about time! I've been waiting a long time for this to come out on dvd. Thank you SisterLee Productions and WB TV.
4,Wound right,"Tightly knit, no-frills progressive rock from the usually overly sensational 70's-era Italians is classy compositional ambition and arranged restraint."
3,Not Bad,This album is OK. I think Coco is much better in her other albums when she is singing original songs. It seems like she tried too hard to sing like the original artists. She did not demonstrate the power in her voice as she did in her other albums. This is not a good example of how good she really is...and she is great.
5,"Peaceful, Restful, Flowing","Simply a great CD. I leave it in the carousel of my CD player, and often just push the button for that position when I arrive home in the evening. I liked the CD when I first listened to it, and like it even more now. This is the second CD that I have from Stephen DeRuby, and it does not disappoint."
5,A beautiful story about a wonderful man,"Fther Judge's documentry touched me so deeply. He helped so many in need. father is an inspiration to all, catholic or not. I am buying more as Christmas presents."
5,Loved This Book.,"I enjoyed this book very much. But then I like all hr books. It was not her uual style, however different can be entertaining."
2,Talk it Over 3,"The delivery is good, I received within 10 days after ordering. However, the CD can not be used with this book because it is from other book. If I knew that I could not use the CD, I would have ordered another without CD book with cheaper price.By the way, this book is good for improving listening skill. It is a little bit advance book, but very effective in improving listening."
3,Good quality but a little too big for me,"The quality of these glasses is good, delivered with no problems. However, they are pretty big, much bigger than standard size wine glasses. The bigger glasses have become popular lately, but beware that these are big and will take up more space than regular wine glasses."
5,A Vision Shared,"Seeing this video is like being in heaven.It can be compared with documentaries like ""Songs of the civil war"" and ""Bringing it all back home"", to name a few. In all these documentaries the various artists put their best feet forward.Strangely enough these are seldom seen on tv."
1,NOT a Goblin King wig,"This is a terrible suggesting if you're looking to dress up as Jareth from Labyrinth. Really it's probably one of the most hideous wigs I've ever seen; no wonder it was so cheap. Cheap, BUT a waste of money. I can't imagine why you'd want to wear it for anything ever."
1,nice basket crappy hardware,"I bought this basket for my new bathroom. It looks really nice but I was very reluctant to drill holes in my new italian tile. However the baskets with the suction cups do not last very long at all so I decided to go with something a little more permanent. I drilled the holes and right away I realized that the inserts were non standard size, the 3/16 holes were too small and the 1/4 too large. I went with the 1/4 and added some silicone to hold them in place and seal the holes. I was already starting to curse. When I tried to screw it down the screw heads stripped right away. Seriously, guys, for that kind of money you cannot put four good quality screws and four standard size good quality inserts in the box? What would that cost you? $0.01? I recommend that until the manufacturer improves the included hardware that nobody buys this - otherwise nice - basket."
4,A Must for Any Patriots Fan,"This book tells the story of the New England (or Boston as they originally were) Patriots.It has lots of facts,interviews & pictures from throughout the history of this now successful franchise told by people in the media who have access to all things Patriots it makes a good read if you want to know more about the team & the people involved with it get this book."
3,Good effort covering history of the Patriots,"Solid effort from author Felger. He covers the first four decades of the team's history, from the club's inception (a bag job giving the franchise to Billy Sullivan) up to but not including the team's three Super Bowl wins. Good reading, especially for younger readers not familiar with the Patriots often inept management.Recommended for all sports fans, especially younger NFL fans."
3,Good To Have in Your Library,"Don Moen was once the ""Gold Standard"" in worship music; however, most people who listen to contemporary worship today would consider this DVD dated and probably stopped listening to it years ago. Even so, Don's music is always done very tastefully and provides a good learning opportunity for Traditional Churches who are struggling to upgrade their worship to a more contemporary style. As a worship leader Don's passion and heart are undeniable. This DVD is good to have in your library, especially if you have members of your worship team that tend to ""over-do"" it during worship. The people Don surrounds himself with are great musicians who possess load of talent, but when they play as a band they operate as team members, each playing within the ""envelope"" offered by the worship moment."
3,Another era,"I like the content of this little book. It was recommended on some other website, I think. Tim Keller recommends it in his book Gospel For Life, but the English is surely different than books written today. Chalmers seems to write almost like a doctoral-level psychologist with rather academic language, and I'm finding it hard to wade through.In terms of content and it's beautiful stuff and the concept is absolutely true, I believe. It can even be seen in children: How do you take away one dangerous thing which they've become attached to? Offer them something else that will fascinate them for the moment. In terms of the Christian life, our desires and our affections must be brought into submission under the Lordship of Christ and our affection for Christ must become supreme to conquer all other unwanted districting attachments that would interfere with worship of Christ."
5,Great family meals!,"I've been cooking mostly vegetarian meals for years and recently decided to cook only vegetarian meals, much to my family's disappointment. However, the meals I've made from this cookbook, such as Cauliflower Mushroom Cheddar Soup, Spinach Potato Feta Strudel and a burrito dish with tofu, avocado and other veggies (can't remember this recipe's name) were all big hits with all but my teenage boy. The dishes are very flavorful and traditional enough for my family to enjoy (they got really tired of all the Asian inspired meals I was making) but interesting enough for me to enjoy, plus protein rich and nutritious."
1,this is pathetic guys i am sorry !,"no no no no.do not even bother to buy this album.i am shocked.just pathetic.i own all albums , 1,2,3,4,5. Every CD is like a mirror.it shows u ur life.ur worth.listening to the music is like ur own life replaying.this CD has gone way way off track.itz more like some beat up old hangout.no class.no finese.sorry.the guys giving high rating to this either are these new age kids or trance lovers.am sorry.save ur money.grab a beer and listen to Vol 5 CD1 again.another tip people: buy any buddha bar cd compiled *ONLY* by DJ David Visan(BB4,5).The fellow is a genious.Better than his mentor Chaude Challe.The others,like Dj Ravin,Dj Joseph Balasandra take a break !!!!"
3,"Very Pretty Book, But Contains Some Inaccurate Recipes","This is a very beautiful book with interesting historical information about the restaurant and lots of nice photos. However several of the recipes that I tried are not accurate and are badly flawed. I have been to the restaurant several times, and I am a very skilled cook. The recipes I have tried to prepare from this cookbook are all flawed in some way and produce results that are nothing like what you get in the restaurant. Some recipes I tried which were flawed are Oysters Bienville, Chantale Sauce, Creamed Spinach, and Caramel Custard. So in summary, this is a very nice book to just look at and read about the restaurant history, but it is quite bad as an actual cookbook. I am still glad I purchased this book for the photos and historical information though."
3,ligno- c moisture meter,this meter is very good over all for the price.I really have not used it all that much yet.I a'm looking forword to feed back from others on this product.what I did use it on worked good.
2,Amana countersink set,These carbide countersinks don't cut as cleanly as my high speed steel countersinks and they cost 3 times as much. Very disappointed.
1,Would Not Recommend!!!,The crib is pretty but not good for my 4 month old son. He rolled over and his leg got stuck inbetween the slats. I had to get baby oil to get his leg loose. He was crying so hard and his leg got bruised. I would not recommend this crib to anyone. I honestly think it is dangerous.
2,TOP Doctors,"Great book in theory. Nice to have all the dr's you need in one spot. Sort of noticing a trend of many accolades for Dr's in the same practice which seemed odd to me. Nice getting exposure to Dr's in specific specialties within specific states. I noticed a few numbers were outdated, but otherwise, I personally think it saves time to have a hard copy of a book versus having to do research on the web. Worth the purchase if it isn't over $5. I believe I must have paid $25 or so which is a complete ripoff for the book"
3,Sue Dengate,"Very good when it comes to childrens intolerances but not enough on adult intolerances, symptoms and how to deal with them etc."
1,"Actually, I give it a 0 star","My long wait for this book ended in such a terrible dissappointment. The book was very confusing and utterly boring. I haven't even finished it yet and don't know if I even want to. I am so sick of this sci-fi, alien, vampire crap he's writing. Mr. Pike please stick to books like Gimme A Kiss, Weekend, Execution of Innocence and Fall Into Darkness. These are truly your best works and some of my most favorite books. Stay away from books such as Magic Fire, The Starlight Crystal, and The Tachyon Web or you will forever have lost a fan and reader."
1,I still haven't finished it.,"In general, I love Christopher Pike. So when I bought this book I was really excited. I got half way through and gave up on it. It was just so boring. I couldn't understand what everything had to do with each other. And it was too weird for me. For a good Christopher Pike read, I recommend the Midnight Club, instead."
5,Cool book!!,"This book is cool! It was strange, but I started to get into it & follow the plot... It was cool! A book written about pyrokenesis. Anyone who is a Christopher Pike book reader must READ this book!!"
