1,Disappointing,"Chose this stapler based on the name and the reviews. Worked for a while and then the pencils began being sharpened on one side only! In addition, now it runs constantly if you don't remove the shavings draw. I will be ordering a different brand."
2,Tears and curses.,"I was so excited to purchase this sharpener for my classroom. Even more excited, I unwrapped it, plugged it in, invited the first student up, and... screech; it stopped dead. Sure, one could coax a sharpening out of the groaning machine, but that's not really what one anticipates. Maybe it's just this one faulty machine, but there it is."
1,Worst Pencil Sharpener Ever!!,"This pencil sharpener is the worst!! I have had it replaced twice already in less than 4 months all because they wouldn't let me returned it at my office supply store. The pencils get stuck, it takes forever to sharpen anything, and heaven help you if you break a tip of your pencil in it, because you'll have to take the whole thing apart to get it out. I hate it and am so angry I spent my money on it."
1,Complete disappointment!,"Sharpened one pencil - and not very well at that - now doesn't work at all! Unfortunately was sent with my son to college, and by the time I could get it back from him, the return period on Amazon had expired."
3,Not bad for single cutter sharpener,"It does sharpen fast, but because it has only a single cutter, tends to shave one-sidedly, leaving the wood on one side all the way to the tip of the sharpened area. I thought at first that it might be that the leads were off center, but It's too consistent to blame it on the individual pencils. Double cutters would be better, but those few I've seen tend to cost quite a bit more. (I didn't look into the manual sharpeners. I remember that the old ones had double cutters, so this could be an option, but you'll have to read the specs very carefully.)My opinion is that, for the cost, this is not an outstanding sharpener. But it certainly does beat the battery-operated one that I had before."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I bought this sharpener in Nov. of 2011 for my sons small classroom. I thought because it said professional on it, that it could handle a fair amount of use. Well I was wrong. It worked great for about a month, then it would never shut off, so had to be unplugged to stop it. Then finally this week it died completely. You would think with a 7 year warranty on it, it might last a while. No I guess not. Now I have to figure out if it's worth even sending it back to the manufacturer. I have been through 3 different sharpeners this school year alone, how hard can it be to make one that works? Save your money, buy and old fashioned wall mounted one if you can."
1,Immediate malfunction,"Yes, do heed the reviews on this product. We used this sharpener a total of three times. The first time, it worked like a charm. The second time, upon being plugged in, it stayed 'on', with or without a pencil inserted for sharpening. The third time we used this sharpener, we plugged it in, it immediately went into the 'on' mode without a pencil, and then, it stopped. It stopped working altogether. Three sharpenings. Time to shop for a new sharpener!"
4,Pretty quiet and makes pencils dangerous weapons!,"Every pencil I sharpened with this thing is pointy enough to do serious damage to someone if you're not careful. Very, VERY pointy points. This makes the tips a little fragile because they have very thin points. The pencils I sharpened write like mechanical pencils, however -- very precise.The sharpener is also pretty quiet. You really can't hear much more than a light whining sound. When I emptied the sharpener, some of the ""filings"" remained stuck inside. It's a little bit hard to clean the filings area; banging the sharpener against the trash can didn't totally clean it either. I ended up resorting to using a small paint brush to clean off the the blade area.But I have to say pencil sharpeners have come a really long way. They also cost way more than they used to, though."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this pencil sharpener and had only used it a couple of times when it suddenly started running and wouldn't shut off without unplugging it. I sent it back and got a replacement which did the exact same thing after less than one day of use. I can see a problem happening with a product once in a while, but if I had the same issue with both items, it can't be just a fluke. I won't ever buy another one!"
2,lopsided,"I bought this sharpener and the trusty Panasonic (that I no longer see here on amazon) together. I knew I wanted the panasonic but I needed two sharpeners- one for home and one for school, so I decided to give the Bostitch a try. It was annoying the heck out of me. It took too long to sharpen, and when it was finally sharpen one side of the tip still had wood around it. You kinda had to twist it around so it can get all the sides. but still it was not all that good, pencil lead would break offwhile writing. I think because the way it was sharpening (or maybe cause I had to twist it around while sharpening) but the point is that it didn't sharpen the way a sharpener is suppose too. Donated it to Goodwill maybe someone will love it. I still have the panasonic and the motor on it is strong and fast. still have it and came back to get another one but don't see it.. going to keep looking though."
1,Terrible Design - Stay Away,"As other reviewers have noted, this sharpener has all sorts of problems - noisy, slow, jams a lot. The worst part, though, is that it only sharpens one side of the pencil, which results in a pencil that is largely unusable when sharpened. I actually bought an expensive pencil thinking I would avoid this problem, but turns out otherwise. Stay away from this device - it's terrible, especially given the premium price."
5,love this show,i wish they make a u.s. restored dvd of this.im stuck with a old edited Recording of it.Please release a restored dvd of this.
2,"Let's be clear, this is a bad movie","It was bad in '66 and it is bad now.That being said, it not without its humorous or cute moments. Jerry Lewis, whether you like him or not, was one of the funniest people in the world at the time and Connie Stevens was fresh and pretty. However, this is not worth the $1,99 rental fee or $5.99 purchase price. Maybe it's worth half."
5,Authentic plus,"If you are into authentic re NW American Indians, this ought to be your first choice. I've been in several museums in the NW and am most excited with the capturing of the art and spirit of the art and background. I am also a wood worker, soon to retire, and this book will let me afford true history I could not affort any other way."
5,The premier book on understanding NW Indian art.,"This is the book that started it all. Bill Holm, while not a native, wrote a Master's thesis on the forms and functions he saw in the art of tribes from the Northwest Coast (from Neah Bay at the tip of Washington state up through Haines in SE Alaska). With the understanding of these stylized forms finally in print, both native and non-native artists came to see how Raven, Eagle, Bear, and other totem images could be portrayed and interwoven.This book is fundamental to understanding NW Indian art."
3,Interesting perspective,I gain some new aspect of qigong in just about every book I read. This book adds another touch of the history of qigong as the author perceives it.It could have had more professional drawings instead of the sketches.
5,Tai Chi Internal work,"This book contains very important notes on internal work.For me, they cover some ""blind spots"" wich I can not find innumerous other Tai Chi sources.It is one of the best Tai Chi books!!!"
3,Good Value,"I bought these shorts since they were 70% less than those sold at the local bike shop. They have proven to be a good product, well woth the price. However, the next time I buy a pair of biker shorts, I will look for a pair with even more seat padding since on longer rides, the bike seat still can become uncomfortable."
4,Comfortable for moderate length rides.,Purchased a pair for my wife and myself. Our bike rides are 18-25 mile trips. So far these shorts have done everything expected of them. Both comfortable and adequate amount of padding in appropriate places. Durability remains to be seen. I would highly recommend these shorts to anyone that takes moderate length rides.
4,"Not bad, not bad at all.","This is a pretty good strategy guide, as far as guides go. It's a lot more useful then lots of others I've seen. And it's got lots of examples with pictures to help show you exactly what to do when you're really stuck. It doesn't have a list of all the monsters, but with all the ones that can be found on DVDs and CDs, I think they did a fine job...I'd buy it I were you. Assuming you need it, that is."
5,Excellent!,"This album is great for meditating, massage, or drifting off to sleep by. I'm puzzled by the claimed release date of 1997, I used to have a copy that I got at the Monterey Bay Aquarium back in 1990 or 1991.Regardless, it's beautiful music! If you like flute, you'll love this one!"
1,TRUE CRIME DOESNT NECESSARILY MEAN ITS TRUE!,TO PUT IT BLUNTLY THIS BOOK IS GARBAGE.WELL WRITTEN THOUGH IT IS THE AUTHOR HAS A TENDENCY TO PLAY AROUND WITH THE FACTS TO MUCH AN HE HAS A TENDENCY TO FOLLOW POLICE AND COURT INFORMATION TO CLOSELY.HE CLEARLY HAD OR DIDNT WANT ANY ACCESS TO MR.GORE OR MR.WATERFIED (THE ALLEGED CRIMINALS)AND THE BOOK SUFFERS FROM IT.THOUGH FREQUENTLY SUSPENSEFUL THE AUTHORS LACK OF TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CASE OUTSIDE OF NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS AND INACCURATE POLICE INFORMATION HURTS THE BOOK.BOTH MR.WATERFIELD AND MR.GORE ARE VERY OPEN ABOUT THERE CASE AND CRIMES AND HAVE BOTH DONE NUMEROUS INTERVIEWS AND CONTRIBUTED TO DOZENS OF WEBSITES.THE AUTHORS DECISION NOT TO APPROACH THEM MAKES THIS BOOK JUST ANOTHER PIECE OF TRUE CRIME FILLER.AS A BOOK IT IS WELL WRITTEN AS A FACTUAL ACCOUNT IT IS PURE RUBBISH.TOSS IT INTO THE TRASH ALONGSIDE MOST TRUE CRIME BOOKS
4,Makes you want to go out and buy a Volvo!,"Interesting book. It has ads from the early 544 Volvos right up to the 850's. It's interesting to see how much ahead of the times they were with safety innovations. When you read page after page of how Volvo engineers designed and built the car with the occupants' safety in mind, you become impressed. When you read about some of the incredible collisions that the owners were able to walk away from, it makes you wonder why you'd want to drive anything else. A very enjoyable book for the ""Volvophile""."
4,The Last Great Epic CD From Henry Lee,"Henry Lee Summer's ""Way Past Midnight"" had plenty of gems, not the least of which were ""Fooled Around And Fell In Love"", which featured a guitar solo from the Eagles' Joe Walsh; ""Till Somebody Loves You"", which was backed by Michael Bolton; and ""Low Flying Man"", which was a local favorite on Indiana's Q95 Radio. ""Turn It Up"" sounds like it should have been included on a ""Simpsons"" soundtrack to an episode involving Radioactive Man, Bart Simpson's favorite superhero--it was that good. This, along with Henry Lee's first album, are the defining moments of his short-lived music career."
2,Kit Review,"I bought this kit about a year ago. all was ok at first; easy install and setup. Once I started using it more, the knobs never worked well. They would turn (fan speed, and temp) but did not turn the controls behind it. In the end I had to remove the knobs and use my fingernail to turn those controls. Next my A/C went out; I dont know if its related, maybe not, but the A/C stopped working and even after i reinstalled the factory radio it still doesnt work. My accord only had 80,000 miles so I believe that is too early for A/C to break, but nothing is impossible. In hindsight I wish I would have kept my stock radio and done the lower kit, or just gotten a speaker line to RCA converter and ran that to my amp and speakers."
3,alright,"The product is exactly as advertised and came very quickly. It seems to be made very poor, the nobs are a downgrade from the stock CD player and stick and also have no lights to indicate which temp or fan speed is selected. There is a multiple second delay for the air-conditioning to start working. For having a aftermarket deck this is the best option without paying for a custom cutout, this is a better option then having 2 CD players but I am worried about having issues further down the road and having to replace this kit. The quality of this kit is very poor."
5,Glad it's back,"I bought the new Serve Chilled album. Like the other reviewer below, it was nice to have something different after Hed Kandi's last few dance albums, which have been a little disapointing. I like that Hed Kandi is now bringing back older compilation series that I thought were long gone. Now if only they could bring back Deeper, I would be very happy! Serve Chilled is a nice collection of chillout tunes that are more upbeat than the dark and acoustic tracks from their Winter Chill compilations (which I also love). Nice summer listening!"
5,A major work of Jewish scholarship,Ephraim E. Urbach was one of the past century's giants of Jewish scholarship. His researches on the Halakhah were not simply studies of its internal development but of its relation to Jewish ethical principles and historical development.
5,Excellent Introduction,"I found this to be easily the best out of a handful of ""beginners"" C++ books that I bought. It cuts right to the point and unlike those big doorstop books this one keeps the reader progressing quickly.It covers the basics (variables, functions etc.) very clearly and includes a lot of detail about pointers and OOP also in a very well organised manner.There is a big chapter covering the standard library functions which I keep flicking back to as I write my own programs, even though I pretty much finished the book a while ago.The only bad thing I can think is that if you already know a bit about programming then the first couple of chapters might not be useful. But its worth it for the later stuff on pointers etc.Overall a great buy!"
2,"Looks Nice, but cheaply made",I got this for my wife and it broke within 15 minutes of her wearing it.
1,"Same misinformation, smaller package","This was a thoroughly disappointing ""work"", that was just a re-hash of the anti-masons tired old line. Nothing new to recommend it, and poorly written. Altogether disappointing."
5,thanks for finally putting this on dvd!,"I have used an increasingly deteriorating videotape of the original broadcast on lifetime in my classroom for years, I'm glad that this film has finally gotten the recognition of a proper DVD release. Not only does this film dramatize an important and terrible event in the civil rights movement in the 1960s, it is a well acted and interesting film. This is a great teaching tool for college students because the 3 civil rights workers are the age of most traditional college students."
3,Best recording of the last 5,"As a big fan of ALL early Saga, I keep buying the new ""stuff"" hoping to catch the spark of the earlier material. This was damn close but still no cigar. Soemething is missing in the new material that does not represent an evolution of the music from one of the best prgressive rock bands of all time.I purchased this CD after reveiwing previously written reviews, but in my option, I think all we Saga fans are reaching for something that is not there. However, I feel this is the best effort of the last 5 CD's."
5,Trust! Great CD for Saga fans!,"Well recorded! This CD is for the well-seasoned Saga fan as a refresher. 10,000 Days and Trust are excellent CD's for the Saga fan that's been with them for 30 years that might have experienced disappointment in past CD's. We're always expecting a Worlds Apart, A Behavior, or A House of Cards. But this is a good one for us! It's worth the buy. Share with newbies to Saga, they may like it.20/20 and Human Condition CD's need to be heard too. Those 2 are outstanding. Human Condition has an interim lead singer and he is great! They sound like a great new band on Human Condition.Trust me. Trust is worth your purchase!"
3,Democratic reform based on Islamic principles is the solution.,"Democracy is the answer to Islam's problems. But it cannot be our kind of democracy. Most Muslims do not accept the Western notion that religion and the state should be entirely separate, that secularism must be the foundation of society. Islam is more than a religion; it is a civilization. Reza Aslan claims that Islam has had a long commitment to religious ""pluralism"". And democracy can be based on this ""pluralism"". It is difficult to visualize how this will actually work in the various Muslim countries and the author does not really flesh it out in detail. The author dedicates many pages outlining the ""correct"" interpretation of Islam and separating it from terrorism. But, of course, the fact remains that terrorists who consider themselves to be true Muslims get their inspiration from Islam, correctly interpreted or not."
5,Wonderful Historical Perspective,Aslan's book provides a wonderful historical narrative of the origins of Islam and how history has shaped it into the religion it is today. His insight into major events over the centuries and how they relate to our current climate is quite elegant. He moves from past to present quite fluently. I recommend this book to anyone with a love of history who seeks a greater understanding of Islam than is provide in the evening news.
3,An OK radio. Just OK.,"This radio has lots of great features (with the notable exception of synchronous detection - reducing signal fade), but it sucks batteries dry very quickly. I would gladly live without a signal strength indicator or 700 memory locations, etc, for longer battery life. Also, I had a problem with my whip antenna on my Eton E5; the connection became loose after a few days of use, so I put it in storage. For a really good SW radio, I highly recommend the Sony ICF-SW7600GR."
5,The Music Says It All,Pure class from its packaging to the sound. I would recommend EVERY JERRY LEE LEWIS COLLECTOR TO BUY THIS COMPACT DISC. IT IS A MUST FOR ANY COLLECTION. THE ARTWORK ON THE OUTER C.D. - IF YOU'RE A COLLECTOR IS BEAUTIFUL! What can I say - it's full of #1 hits yet Jerry Lee Lewis IS NOT IN THE COUNTRY MUSIC HALL OF FAME! This COMPACT DISC PROVES HE DESERVES TO BE THERE AND BILLBOARD KNOWS IT!Nothing but hits and class. The man is a legend of 66 years and you would think the Country Music Association would recognize him after everything he has contributed. The Music on the compact disc speaks for itself as well as their respective COUNTRY CHART POSITIONS!
5,"simple, nice looking, cheap",The product is well made and excellent for the price. Note: The ones I received were a shade darker than the light blonde color I thought I saw in the photo. The darker shade was actually better for my use.
4,"Lengths were great, but the ends that go into the valve cover for the spark plugs were a little long.","The lengths were good, but the ends that go into the valve cover for the spark plugs were a little long. The problemwith them being too long is that piece that seals the hole is to high."
2,"Same beautiful voice, same boring material","It's more of the same on Motherland, if you have Our Time in Eden and Tigerlily, you don't need to bother with this, there is nothing new or exciting here."
1,more pretentious mope rock,"The pretentious, heavy-handed, and self-absorbed Natalie of Blind Man's Zoo is here in abundance. Sure the themes have changed, but the style and form remain unchanged. Imagine the high school girl who won first place in English Comp setting her text to music. Now you're prepared for this mess. Put this back on the shelf until Ms Merchant finds a sense of humor."
2,Recorded after a dental visit,"You've got to be kidding! The novacane just can't last.. My goddess sounds like she recorded this after a dental visit. She sounds worse than my Bob Dylan impression.. I thought 'My skin' was the most beautiful thing since 'My time in Sing Sing, or was it Eden' and 'Unplugged respirator', and then this Lousinana cajun dog arrived.. I admit having a weakness for those New England, raven haired, Walden (or was it golden) pond Thereaou poetry girls, but your pushing it here. The melodys are at times nice (in a goldrush anthrocite sort of way) and her lyrics are of course plateau's above 'I honestly love you' choke, but I can't bear to stay 'amoung the living winos', if it's in some 'born on the bayou' bar room floor. I might as well write my autobiography as an eskimo in queens. get me out of here, John Fogerty. perhaps I'm unfair.. I will probably like it tomorrow, but right now, the ... suzuki violin CD sounds better.. Love YA Natalie.."
2,What Happened to Natalie's Voice?,"What is Natalie trying to prove now? I've got just about all her albums...great stuff...and love the few times I've seen her ""live"" on television...but what is wrong with her voice? I've listened to this album several times over the years I've had it here, and just keep thinking that she sounds like someone who was advised to smoke a lot of cheap cigars, in an effort to lower or deepen her voice...and possibly a daily ration of scotch to go with that. She sounds tired, gray, and as if someone has slowed down the record...like someone trudging through a foggy day. I suppose it could be that her overflowing social conscience has her thinking she's a woman of color now, and she's trying to emulate the sound of a black woman blues singer...I don't know...but it's sad."
5,"Best Thing Since ""Our Time In Eden"" With 10,000 Maniacs","I have pretty much the complete Natalie Merchant discography from Maniacs, to solo, to guest appearances with the Chieftains. Motherland is a great album. After listening to her for fifteen years, her voice still entrances me. Natalie Merchant's voice really is liquid gold."
3,All Summer,A lot of fun if you know the Jersey Shore. Especially interesting if you spent much time there in the 60s and 70s.
5,Listen up or be out-sourced to unemployment,"Tom makes his points by moving to an aggressive publisher that freely prints his exclamation points and aggressive red ink. The content repeated a lot of what he has said before, but most of it was somewhat more focused and deserved being repeating anyway. This would be good book to supply with an accompanying DVD to get the full impact of Mr. Peter's enthusiasm.The references to white-collar jobs being replaced by a cheap microprocessors or cheap labor was right on the mark. Thoughts were freely borrowed from others such as Pink's ""Free Agent Nation,"" but that's ok.The lists of sources referenced throughout the book were worth the price of the book. It reminded me a bit of reading about the sources of tools in the Whole Earth Catalog in the old days.Overall re-imagine is a timely, relevant, thought provoking, and well-reasoned call to action (consider the points or suffer the consequences)."
4,Stars within reach,"I can't say what the impact of Mr. Peters book would relate to corporate world except in broad terms, however for a budding small business owner like myself its both inspiration and informative. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a fresh perspective and would buy it for any or my friends thinking about starting their own business. I continue to Imagine!!!"
2,! Contrasts,"I'm a 40 something MBA with 20+ in the Valley. It's still the best place to work...Tom you should not have left. Like the 20 something MBAs, I also found this book pretty dated. I'm only half way through the book as it does not digest very well. Somethings work well (!Contracts) others fail (those nearly invisible dotted lines leading to margins). The margins are not very interesting an don't stand out or supplement the main text in a meaningful way as the main text is very fragmented.Here's my ! Contrasts so far...WAS :: ISWomen in the workplace :: Gays in the workplaceBlue Sky :: Sarbanes-OxleyType A personality :: Type A + BStarbucks :: Peet's coffeeMad as hell :: Psychological IntelligenceRedux :: invent a new term, pleaseConfusing layout :: User-friendlyLarry Ellison :: Steve Jobs (still)"
4,Work well for giving medicine to cat,"We use these with the tips cut off to give medicine mixed with watered down cat food to our cat and they work well. They start binding very soon after using, but the cat destroys the tip by biting it in a couple of weeks anyway.Beyond the binding issue, the only problem with these is that they ship USPS first class, so it can take a couple of weeks between ordering and delivery. Plan ahead if you're reordering them."
3,A few Worthy Pieces,"There are a actually a few exceptional, even edgie, contemporary pieces sprinkled around, and I think that artists and designers might consider picking up this book, if they can land a cheap copy,Overall, the editor's taste leans toward vulgar kitsch, so I wouldn't advise paying anywhere near full price."
5,A genius of political humor,"Breathed is a great cartoonist in general, but his political satire is without equal. For those of us coming of age politically in the mid to late 1980s, this book will provide a constant source of laughs, from disgraced televangelists to football strikes to (my all time favorite) alien dogs that look and act surprisingly like Oliver North. Don't miss!"
3,"Okay, but over the top in places","Won't rehash the plot. This story was different and the characters were well defined, including the secondary ones. The romance was there too.There is much to like about the way the story is told EXCEPT the crazy way Rosie just had to prove to her dead abuser step-father that she was better than he always said she was. Just some over the top situations and the ending was a let down. Still, I'd give this one a 3.5 and recommend it because I read it all the way through, enjoyed it for the most part."
5,The Actor's Must-Have!,Highly informative and very entertaining... anyone thinking about embarking on an actor's life should read this book! Loved it!
1,Product description doesn't match part received,Add pictures are missleading as it describes a flange that is split for pre-rigged boats. I thought I would be getting the flange that is split and is a y-fitting on the hose. What I received was not what I expected and the value is not worth the hassle to return.
5,simply amazing,"I found this plot amazing. I wasn't sure if i wanted to read such a sad and depressing book, even right in the start of the book. I was angry at some spots and amused at others. This book is very easy reading. I liked the ending a lot. It was a complete ending, you felt good at the end. I am glad Sigmund Brouwer gave the book this ending."
2,Limiting God,"Something that is not often mentioned is that the moment anyone attributes a property to God, that limits God, making his ineffability and infinity impossible, not to mention his being ""wholly other"" or incomprehensible to humans. If a person posits that God is omnibenevolent, the person is also saying that God is comprehensible with respect to benevolence. If God is infinite in any sense of the word, claiming to understand anything about him is unjustified. There is no inductive or deductive reasoning that leads to any property of God."
2,Not worth the effort,"I found the book disappointing in that it depends on the interpretation of experience being a legitimate means of proving the existence of a deity. I don't need this book for that. Also the christological bent of this author is offputting, giving the sense that he's not able to step back far enough to sense whether his views are in truth as objective as he pretends them to be, or as I sense them to be, subjective wishful thinking."
4,An excellent source for familiarization of the medium.,"If you have tried working with polymer clay and would like to learn a variety of possible designs using the clay, try this tape. Be warned that the instructor uses a great deal of clay, which can get expensive. If you don't already own some of the tools needed for the projects you may incur some added expenses for these as well. If you're a novice like me, you may find it difficult or impossible to do the projects without a pasta machine. The techniques are fun, however. I made a pretty vase using the mokune gane technique I learned from the tape. With Christmas on its way, I'll be using the techniques I learned from Donna to make ornaments and gifts. For the person interested in taking up polymer clay as a hobby, the tape is definitely worth the price. Even those who are more advanced in the medium may learn some new techniques."
5,"Part travelogue, part sketchbook","I love this book. I stumbled across it today at a book sale and I am just taken with it. I've visited the majority of places detailed in the book and as I turn each page, I feel as if I've been transported, once again. There is a brief narrative at the beginning, but the majority of the book is consumed with sketches, cited only with a precise local and a date, affording the observer the ability to write their own personal history."
5,Helping Children Survive Divorce,This book is proving to be qute beneficial in helping our son's interaction with his two 11 and 15-year old sons during his divorce proceedings.
3,NOT as pictured,"This rocker is really nice, we got it in espresso finish. However, it does not have ANY bottom rungs like in the pictures. I am not happy about this!! Why can't you get it right Amazon?? My 20 month old cannot scoot herself all the way into the chair. I'm keeping it because it is very nice quality, and is even heavier than you would think. She will just have to grow into it. Boo Amazon, been disappointed in you lately. :/"
2,Baby's Rocker,"I was looking for a rocker the little one could enjoy for a few years. The size of the chair would be okay for an average child till around 4 years old, it seems to be durable, but the back is too straight and it does not rock well, the ""rockers"" aren't curved enough."
1,Beware no free shipping from the Dealer Impossible Discounts,My order qualified for free shipping this merchant charged me $7.96 shipping. I contacted them they wrote back and let me know they do not ship anything free. Check all your invoices. You should not have to babysit an order but it seems anymore you have to watch everything. I am very disappointed.
4,Fun album,"I found this album at a listening post at my local cd shop and had to get it because it was so fun and refreshingly different. I would describe it as funky disco techno lounge. There is some funky bass, it can sometimes have a lounge feel, sometimes a dancey disco feel, but the songs all have a high bpm, which I like. There is a lot of uncommon instrumentation on this album too. And it's very well produced. The singer is great, and has a very sexy voice. Also, you'll find that the album has quite a range of songs, all quite different. If I had to predict the radio hit, I'd say it was number 5, Fantasy. There are many other great tracks. I also love 8 and 6. Check this album out with an open mind. You're sure to like it if you like the unique."
4,Very nice fine sieve,This sieve is sturdy and of good quality. The mesh is very fine and suitable for straining stock and clear soups. Because it is stainless you can put it in the dishwasher too.
3,Made in China,"This is a great strainer but I feel it is being advertised falsely. The Culinary Institute of America makes it seem like the product is made in America. However, it is made in China"
1,"Rare, but not good!!","I love extended and remix versions, but..... this CD is horrible, flat, to much techno (maybe) If you are a Chic fan... or love dance remixes, you gonna be disaponted with this disc! (also with the price)."
5,sensational knitted socks,I am a male who knits and don't do things to difficult.Her book got me on the road to taking on newer projects.It was easy to read and understand.I thoroughtly enjoyed it.Eric J. Hoar
4,Endless variety!,"A friend recommended this book to me. She liked the variety of patterns, the instructions, and pictures. I agree 100%! I am working on my first pair of socks, but truly enjoy picking sizes and patterns to work on. The only problem I have is figuring out the gauge for each pattern - I don't know if this is me missing that part, or it's just not there. In any case, as a relative beginner, I recommend the book if you have at least some knowledge of sock knitting (You Tube was an excellent resource for me)."
2,Do you only learn from your natural parents?,"I was doing fine with the book until it took a turn against adoptive parents--Was Ms. Letts implying you could only learn to swim, ride a bike, listen to stories, have birthday candles on your cake, give warnings of safety (street crossings, scissors), or receiving a good night kiss only from ones birth mother? As an adoptive parent, I feel the wrong message was protrayed in this book. I have enjoyed other books by Ms. Letts, and I hope her future writings improve!"
3,Under Contract with Walmart,I certainly hope Ms. Letts is receiving money from Walmart considering how many times she mentions the store in her books. Maybe I would have enjoyed this book more had she had the characters shop at Target instead.
2,"Waited eagerly for this one, but...","Oh, how I wanted to love this book. I love Billie's other books, but this one just did not ring true for me. I found myself enduring it rather than enjoying it. The characters were not compelling and the plot was transparent."
3,Cute Romantic Novel,"I love Billie Letts' other novels and thought this would be a perfect read for recovery from surgery ... and it was. It's very light and sweet with a little bit of sass thrown in it. It is (unfortunately) unpredictable, but this time, I don't care. I needed something of Letts' writing style to keep me entertained. This book fits the bill.This book is about a murder case that has remained unsolved for almost 30 years. The young woman was also a mother of a 10-month old baby boy who suddenly disappeared. They gave Nicky Jack up for dead once they found his pj bottom at the bottom of the creek. Years later, Mark Albright comes back home to find out the truth about his parentage and got more than he bargained for in the very pregnant Ivy, whom he thought was his cousin.It is a sweet novel and one to endear readers all over. It is a perfect gift to give to someone who is in the hospital or for the long airplane ride.9/20/09"
5,A good devotional to have,"During a women's meeting, two chapters written by two different women were read. Both were very good and had some humor and a message to them. I had to get this devotion to read. I am not through the whole book yet, but I am not disappointed. I would recommend this book."
2,not stand alone,"This unit must be plugged into a monitor; somehow, I thought it was self-contained when I ordered it. Not all was lost, however, as I donated it to community services for a needy child at Christmas."
4,Very pretty!,"I was not sure of how these earrings would look when I saw them online but the good reviews pushed me to order them.I must say I am very impressed by the color and the elegance of these earrings for the price I gave.I received so many compliments at work for them, I am very happy with the purchase.Adi"
2,didn't work for me,"After reading all the great reviews, I optimistically ordered some of this tea. I've had problems with sinus congestion very often this winter and have tried all kinds of remedies with little success. Unfortunately, this really didn't do anything for me. The taste is OK (bearable), but it did nothing to relieve my sinus congestion. (So far the only things I've found that have helped me somewhat are the Vicks personal warm mist humidifier and Neti Xlear)"
4,Good mini series,"Like most, I got this for Gerard Butler, but also for the good reviews and I like to widen out to watching movies from different countries. I'm not usually a big fan of British entertainment, but I did like this. All the acting was solid. It was pretty good for most of it, but it REALLY got interesting once the jury went into deliberation. That took the whole series up several notches and made me glad I spent the money to watch it.As far as not being rated....I would have given it a strong PG-13 for language. I was told they can allow three ""F"" words in a PG-13 and I counted three. Something to keep in mind if you are sensitive to cursing like I am. Some of the pictures of the murder scene were a tad graphic as well."
1,Of course this doesn't have anything on how to raise the money,because Mr. Galloway's movie is Walmart propoganda paid for by... guess who. There are much better books on how to schedule and plan a movie. Don't give any more money to this hack by buying his book.
4,Excellent source for workout routines.,"I have been lifting for 18 months now, I have varied my routine about every 8-12 weeks or so and was running out of ideas,this book is full of great workouts each for different goals and a lot of usefull tips for lifting, a little bit of general nutritional info but definitely great for the weight lifters."
5,A book to make grey ordinary days brighter than bright!,"Sark has an inspirational word to lift even the dullest days. Brightly coloured pages challenge you to look at your life and find happiness, excitement and a childlike enthusiasm that you perhaps haven't felt since you played in the sand pit with you knee high playmates! This is not a 'self-help' book,or a scary new-age hippy book - it is a huge splash of colour reminding us all to relish life with all our energy and passion. I read this book on the train into work in the morning and it helps me to focus on what's important - living juicy and having fun! I urge you to read it and wake yourself up to creativity, mischieve, laughter and lots and lots of juice"
5,Love those cups!,"I love cappuccino and have a daily dose in these beautiful cups. I simply love them - the right size, very smooth surface."
5,What a movie!,"Keeping Mum is one of the best movies I've seen in a while and it has everything, murder, comedy, sex, you name it! Maggie Smith is perfectly cast as is Kristin Scott Thomas and let's not forget ""Mr. Bean,"" who is equally as good in this delightful movie. Much better and far more entertaining than the usual shoot 'em up crammed with special effects movies that seem to be engulfing our cinemas. If you just want a fun movie with a story, yes a real story, and some laughs, Keeping Mum is one not to keep mum about!"
4,Macabre Mary Poppins,"Walter Goodfellow (Rowan Atkinson), the vicar of a small village in England is too preoccupied and befuddled with his job to pay any attention to his wife (Kristin Scott Thomas), so she has an affair with her golf teacher (Patrick Swayze) while his kids are lost and in trouble. Then a new housekeeper (Maggie Smith) enters their lives and all their problems seem to disappear.I didn't know what to expect from this movie and was puzzled in the beginning but ended up liking it. It's a dark comedy that's exceedingly dry and subtle, more sinister than comedic, and very British in tone. The cast, led by the marvelous Maggie Smith, is superb and they hold your interest even when the story is at times odd and confusing. The location photography is gorgeous. This is definitely not a laugh-out-loud comedy, but is ultimately sweet and clever. 3.5 stars."
3,quirky comedy,"In this slow-moving and simple love story, director Niall Johnson employs quirky, black humor to rescue the marriage of Reverend Walter Goodfellow (played by Rowan Atkinson of Mr. Bean fame). With a nymphomaniac teenage daughter, a nerdy son who gets bullied at school, a neighbor with an incessantly barking dog, and a husband-pastor who is resorting to feeble humor in his sermons and is oblivious to it all, the wife Gloria decides to fix her life by falling for her American golf instructor. Lucky for everyone, into this mix there comes a new housekeeper aptly named Grace. Grace sees and understands all. She takes drastic measures to fix everyone, partly because in a nice plot twist she has some baggage of her own to unburden. This isn't a great movie, but it moves to a tender resolution that made me glad I watched it."
4,"Not as good as Everything Must Go, but still good","This 1998 follow-up to Everything Must Go isn't as good as it's predecessor, but it still has some great songs. My favorites are The Everlasting, If You Tolerate This (Your Children Will Be Next), Tsunami, and My Little Empire. However, this album gets really ponderous and sluggish towards the end, and songs like Black Dog on My Shoulder and Born a Girl are bordering on rubbish."
3,not quite essential,"now, in order to make an instant classic album you need a little more than five premium songs, because the rest of the album should include no fillers, either. And that is the problem here. Somebody should give Jimmy D a free slack or a pure welsh preach, because if he can write 5-6 definite classics, he can write 5-6 other fine songs, dammit!"
4,Sure Block,The product was what I expected and the service from Amazon was great. It arrived much sooner than I anticipated. Thank you.
4,Best party game on PS2,"If you have a multi-tap and 4 controllers you are in for a night of fun. You can play 2 on 2 battles with you frieds or 3 on 1 and even 2 players vs 2 CPU opponents. Create strategies with your teammates, play nothing but monsters of the same element type, create several decks of cards for different purposes the combinations are endless. This game is loads of fun and hours waste away while immersing yourself in the gameplay. The only downside to this game is that memory card data is exclusive to one memory card (it does not allow itself to be copied) so you can't aqquire you friends cards from the begining but by playing with multiple friends you can unlock cards very quick and develop some killer decks."
3,locker bed rails chevy shortbox/reg cab,"This is my second set of this particular item,the first set,the chrome-plated end caps pitted severely after 5 years even though I put a good coat of 3-M paste wax on them every month during the western NY winters,I will see after a few years what this set looks like. The stainless tube held up well as did the attaching system."
2,Ear Hook Breaks Easily,"I purchased this unit in July, based on many positive review. I can't complain about the sound quality, it is great even when I was driving with my convertable. However, this unit is very difficult to put on, even using both hands. The wrost part is, the ear hook just break in half due to normal useage for only three months!"
5,"Great price, great performance","I use it with my thinkpad to Skype and it paired without any headach, and the coverage is well over the regular 10 to 30 feet, I went as far as 50 feet and still the quality was good. The rubber hook for the ear is a bit stiff. Well worth the money.John"
2,Defective - Won't Fully Charge,"Brand new headset and it doesn't fully charge. Followed all instructions clearly and I can never get this thing to charge long enough to manage more than 1h talk time or 8h stand by. My sister's headset (same exact model) won't even turn on.Too bad, when it works the quality of sound is great... problem is getting it to work!"
2,Great Disappointment,"After reading some of the on-line reviews which I located thru Google, I had ""Great Expectations"" for the Logitech Mobile Bluetooth coupled with my LG 325 phone.I have to say, when in-doors, beit in the house or in the car with the windows up, it works wonderfully!BUT, take the unit out of doors and the fabled ""Windstop"" microphone fails dismally. AND, what good is a wireless headset if you can only use it in-doors????"
3,"Good sound/connectivity quality, short battery charge.",This an excellent headset. Connecting was fast and easy. The only problem is that I have to recharge it frequently. Charge runs out even being only in stand by mode.
2,Bad battery,Worked good for a few months.. then battery started draining fast. Now after just 1 or 2 calls the battery is dead.
2,Uncomfortable,"Bought this because Logitech has a great reputation with other products. I used this for a short period due to it being uncomfortable and I never found the battery life to be long enough. I actually went back to a Jabra wired unit until recently, when I purchased a Samsung bluetooth headset that is comfortable, has good battery life, and the sound is better. I guess I prefer the in-ear style."
2,Not great,"I have two of these head sets. One never keeps its charge, pretty much from the time I bought it. The other seems to charge alright. the ear piece is cheap and feels like it could break off anytime.The sound quality on my end is good but my friends have complained about a slight buzzing sound and ask me to switch to a wired mic.Also it's big and heavy compared to the motorola I own. I highly recomend the motorola. (sorry i dont know the model number off hand)"
3,Don't expect any repair service,"Unit worked fine, but when ear loop broke outside of 1 year warranty I was offered the chance to buy an new one at ""50% off"" that was actually more expensive than what I paid for this one. They were unwilling to simply replace the ear loop, even if I offered to pay. Do not expect any service from Logitech. Their online service told me to call them and I had to pay for the call (and hold time) to be told ""tough luck""!"
4,Logitech Bluetooth,"Just ordered this headset for dad, he is using a nokia 6021. I am currently using a sony ericsson hb45 headset.The logitech looks much more refined and is classy in a nice black executive feel. It is quite light and easy to slip on.The reception is crisp and clear and no echo of any sort.Final verdict is that it is a good bet for the price , but if you want something more fancier, you could go in for the jabra or mobile handset specific headsets."
2,"Just OK, that's all..","The Logitech freedom headset gives you freedom alright, but no volume. The noise canceling works great, but the sound volume was too faint for me. In addtion, the fit was not right and I would consider my ear to be of normal size. Too little thought went into this product... My vote? Don't waist your time trying it, or the shipping charge sending it back. Sorry Logitech, most of your products rock."
4,"Good choice, but a bit clunky looking","Not much for looks but works as advertised. It's my first Bluetooth headset so I have nothing to compare it with for performance, but everyone who I have talked to while using it has commented that the sound quality is as good or better than my Treo 650's microphone.I've used it outside while traffic was going by and the person on the other end did not even hear the traffic. Like I said I don't like the Borg look but for my purposes (using it in the car or walking around the house) it is a great buy. I had to promise my wife I wouldn't walk down the sidewalk while using it. I've had a number of other Logitech devices and have always had good luck with them.The advertised range is adequate for use in the house. Seems to have little trouble with going through several walls. I'd give it five stars if it weren't so clunky."
3,Voice quality good but fit could be better,"The voice quality for the headset is above par. I have not had any problems conducting calls in and out of the car.However, this headset has to be the largest one I have ever owned. The rubber fitting does not hold it tight on my ear and I found myself constantly re-adjusting it.Overall, for the price I got what I expected."
4,Good headset with a few minor problems,The Logitech Mobile Freedom headset is a very good headset for a good price. The clarity was very good on my end and also to the people on the other end. The noise cancelation worked very well so I was able to be heard in windy or noisy conditions. The headset fit well on either ear and was confortable to wear for long phone calls. It was also very easy to set up out of the box after reading the instructions which were easy to follow.The only problem I had was that I had to adjust the volume at the begining of every call to the point that I could hear the other person well without hearing my own voice retansmitted. I would still be using that headset if I hadn't broke the arm off it. I was hanging it of the inside of my shirt and I fell asleep on a couch and evidently rolled in such a way as to break the arm off it . I was unable to find a replacement arm so had to get a new headset.
2,VERY LOW BATTERY LIFE,"Well, I am not too happy with my purchase. Though the other factors are good, I dont like the time it lasts after charging.It usually lasts around 30-45 minutes before it completely gets out of charge, and thats full charging after more than 4 hours.Well I am not sure if its due the bad piece I have got or there are some real battery life issues. But yes when it works it is excellant, no problems with compatibility or connection problems or any other problems. Dont know what more to say but I wont suggest it."
2,"nice features, but bad sound quality","The sound quality seemed ok when I received it, but after using it for about a week, people started complaining that they couldn't hear me well. One person indicated that it just seemed like there was a loud noise in the background. Not being able to use it, I returned the headset."
2,Do not buy,"I will be short: exchanged 5 times for the past year. Earpiece, which goes around ear, has serious design flaw. No matter how gentle you use it - it will break within 4 months. POSITIVES: longer battery life than most other BT (BlueTooth), greater radius."
2,"ok at first, then had to return TWICE!","We had it for four months and it broke twice. The first time the battery life lasted less than 10 minutes, the second time it broke practically in half! Not using it again..."
3,Great headset until the arm broke!,"Like the title mentions, this headset was a good buy for the money until the arm busted on it about 3 months after I bought it. Now its worthless, and without a receipt, its a paper weight.Also, the device really didn't fit around my ear very well. If I would do any sudden turns of the head it would loosen and eventually come off.I wouldn't recommend this to other buyers. Find something that is more compact and fits better around the ear."
4,Very good signal.,"Good: Strong signal, loude volume.Bad: The catalogue did not tell me how to pair the set to the phone. I had to go to logitech.com to figure out how to do it.Comparing to others on the market: I can say any thing since this in the first bluetooth I have."
4,Muy buen producto,"Muy buen producto (con el teléfono Sony Ericsson K700i).Pros:1.- Audio excelente, la voz de los interlocutores se escucha perfecto y los nuestra voz también es escuchada muy bien.2.- Ajuste adecuado en la oreja; no aprieta, es cómodo.3.- Se sincroniza rápidamente con el teléfono y cambia automáticamente al modo manos libres.Contras:1.- No es totalmente manos libres; requiere que se apriete un botón para aceptar la llamada. No funciona la ""palabra mágica"" del teléfono para ser totalmente manos libres.2.- En ambientes moderadamente ruidosos es difícil el reconocimiento de la voz para realizar la llamada"
3,Dosen't fit my ear,"I bought this bluetooth headset to use with my Treo 650. Getting the Logitech headset configured was easy, it took about 2 mimutes. Range is good. The volume could be better, although it is clear of any static, crackles or pops. My main problem with the logitech is it dosen't fit my ear good. The ear band is very uncomfortable. It feels like its smashing my ear. The headset is very uncomfortable if you are wearing it for a long time. Also it would be nice to have a case and, or neck strap to carry the headset in. It also would be great if the headset could be used to play back MP3's from the Treo. The wind noise is gone.I will still be shopping for a headset that is comfortable and has the features of the Ligitech"
4,Downgraded to two stars.,"Update: After months of using this headset I've retired it after finding it just too frustrating. It does work, just not well enough. At one point the price was good enough to make this a bargain. That is no longer the case...look elsewhere.--------I've owned this for a few weeks now and I am generally happy. Bluetooth seems to add to the cell phone lag experience (a drag with every bluetooth device I've used). I worry often if people can hear me or hear the crackling I get with this device. Most reassure me that everything is clear enough.I've tried on ones that fit better work about the same but cost far more. You take your pick in the priority aisle, will it be price, function or form. This is the best in price and close in function. Form? Don't expect to see this piece in a modern art exhibit anytime soon.If you want a bargain, stop now. If you want the best experience, keep shopping. (No longer a bargain...keep shopping)"
2,Bulky and uncomfortable,"I'm a great believer in spending as little as possible on glitz,bells and whistles, and generally go for performance and practicality. Sound quality and features are fine for the price. But the unit is quite difficult to wear -- the boom is wide and boxy; the weight is unbalanced, as well. I could not get a comfortable fit. My ear is well within normal range of size and shape, but was bent out of shape by the headset.On the positive, wind noise and lost connections -- common criticisms of other BT headsets -- was not a problem here. If you don't care about medium to long term fit and comfort, or the aesthetics of walking around with such an large unit hanging off your ear, you may be happy with this headset. I wasn't, and am returning it. I'm going to give the Cardo Scala a try; if it's no good, I'll probably go with a Jabra, and spend a bit more money."
2,Decent audio - but uncomfortable,"Pretty decent audio, good reception, worked well with connecting. But, the earhook design was very uncomfortable, and not meant to be worn for a long time."
2,Works great but ear piece broke,I used this item a lot and it worked great. After 4 months of regular use the rubber ear piece broke so now its unusable. I need to get another one but I won't buy this one for fear of it breaking again so soon after my purchase.
3,"Not bad, would've liked to see a season 2","After the first three or four episodes, I was ready to give up on The Event. I was sick of the flashbacks, and the predictability of scenes involving the young couple. What kept me interested were the White House scenes (Sorry, trying to stay spoiler free). I thought the acting there was top-notch. As I watched more episodes and the overall story began to come together (flashback-free), I began to really enjoy the show and root for many of the characters: Agent Lee, and the head of Intelligence (forgot his title) were a couple of my favorites.......And then it was over. The Event often alluded to during the show was never actually shown. Not a problem for season 1, but I really would've liked to have seen a season 2. I hear that won't happen. Too bad,"
3,It's a transformer,"Hard to get excited about it. It's a little pricey which is why I gave it a lower score. Other than that, it does what it's supposed to do."
3,Checksoft,"I have used Microsoft Money for the past 15 years.. I recently purchased a new laptop and needed a new version of MM, but they have discontinued it.. I tried Checksoft and it is a comparable product to MM, but there is to many annoying things you have to do to enter or change a transaction. MM, you just entered your transaction. Checksoft, you have to click ""new"", and either tab or use your mouse to get to the fields you need. MM, was just straight forward, Check #, date, to who, amount/either transaction or deposit, if want to put something in the memo, enter... To edit in MM same thing, just go in and edit. You don't have to hit a ""edit"" button, just edit..Checksoft is a nice program, it keeps my checkbook balanced, but I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it..."
1,Terrible drive,"I bought two of these. After a year and a half of operation, one is dead, and the other is clearly dying, as more and more bad sectors are cropping up. One failure I could write off as a fluke. But two - plus all the other lousy reviews here - convince me that this is just a flimsy product. Save yourself the trouble and buy something more robust."
2,Slow to wake up,The unit goes into a hibernation mode after an undetermined amount of time. There are no settings or software to control it. Most of the time you will need to sit and wait for it to repsond if anything such as Windows Explorer needs to access all of your drives. This product is a dog.
1,do yourself a favor and keep shopping around,"i bought this at a college bookstore discount less than a year ago. it was working fine for the most part, although every once in a while (after about 4-5 months) it would make a loud, ugly noise that sounded like something was scraping around on the inside. i should have replaced it then, but nothing seemed to have been damaged or lost and i didn't have the money.all of a sudden, today it dies. it turns on but won't show up in finder. files are all gone, some of them irreplaceably. suddenly i have no options for backing up my computer, which i having a few problems of its own. looking for the warranty right now, hopefully they'll just refund me the money instead of sending a new unit.it's not worth the trouble! get something else. i've heard good things about the seagate freeagent products, so i might look at those next."
1,Better Choices,"Although set-up was easy, the WD didn't provide any back-up software. I would've rated the 2500 at least a three, if the transformer hadn't died within just 3-months."
1,Drive died after 1 month,"I bought drive to backup my work files. Great design, fairly compact. No software included for backups so you have to provide your own. Worked fine for 1 month but drive failed. Would not power up.RMA process costly and at your expense. You must ship in anti-static bag (so save box). No communication or response to 4 e-mails I sent - never had a company be so unresponsive. Not only did I lose 1 month of backups but it cost me quite a bit to ship back.Recommend if you buy it to don't rely solely on it for at least a few months. You have a chance of losing your only copy of something if the drive fails. Hope replacement is more reliable.*Update* Replacement drive was new (not refurbished) and has worked fine ever since. I must have gotten a bad unit. Drive is pretty quiet and power up quickly and is pretty intelligent to power down when not it use. Will be buying Acronis True Image or Norten Ghost to back up images/quicker to restore system than just backing up files."
1,Unhappy Owner,"Purchased a new WDG1U2500 on September 9, 2006. Had to have it replaced and mailed the unit to WD. The replacement was also defective and it was a REFURBISHED one. Returning a defective new unit and receiving a refurbished one in exchange is not right. I hope the second replacement will be a NEW one. Had to pay USPS $17.70 (includes insurance and tracking) for the first return. Hope to make positive comments and give better rating after receiving a replacement and being able to use it. At the moment I wish I had not purchased the unit."
1,Died after 3 days,"It worked fine for 3 days, and now suddenly it does not power up anymore. Having just read the other reviews I'm sorry I bought it."
1,So what happened to my data?,"Very disappointed in this hard drive. I use it to back up both my PC and my wife's laptop. I recently had to reformat the PC and when I turned to the hard drive, it could not be found by XP. Arrrgggghhhh. It easily reformatted itself with the WD software but that does me little good as all of my kid's video's were on the drive as a backup. So I thought I was being clever by having a backup to my PC hard drive only to discover that I needed a backup to my backup. Beware"
1,"First one failed quickly, second one so slow","The first one I had failed before I could even transfer much to it. I got the replacement, but it is the slowest writing of six external drives that I have. It is agonizingly slow, slow, slow. I'd never buy one again."
2,Great while it lasted.,"I had this drive for over a year. I had it just about full of important video files. I had it standing up instead of flat, and when the cat bumped it, it tipped over. That's right, it just tipped over. It didn't fall off the desk or smash on the ground, it just went from standing to sitting. Well, I guess that was enough, because after that, it stopped working. Goodbye files. Overall, I'd say look elsewhere."
5,WD External Hard Drive,Got a 250GB HD last month. It works very well with my Windows 98SE machine. Good for backups and will facilitate transition to more advanced operating system in the future.
5,We can always learn more about prayer!,"I Loved the book. Easy to read, understand and apply. It contains a chapter by chapter bible study in the back for group studies. However it can also helps you evaluate what you have learned and what you need to take a 2nd look at."
4,Great album,This album is great follow up the proceeding albums. I totally disagree with the person below me. I believe there are great riffs in the songs and Lajon still sounds great. This is definitely a good pickup if you liked the following cds.
1,The previous guy is right,"Nu metal is pretty much done, and as a former fan I can only wish the members of Sevendust to find something they love doing other than playing music and find it fast. The New American Thrash and metalcore scenes are running the show now, and bands like Sevendust are about as relevant as whatever hair metal bands where leftover after Nirvana came out."
1,Crap.,"I bought this cd thinking to myself, ""This will be great!"", and I heard it all the way through once, and sold it. This is their only bad album, and I was hoping for it to be A LOT better than this."
1,I'd give no stars if it were an option!,"Sevendust is for kids who wear those silky baggy shirts with flames on them and smell bad. It's music for inbred skanks whose idea of romance is the dirty sanchez. These unoriginal ""children of the korn"" have somehow programmed this disc to take away IQ points from your brain as you listen to it. But if you're a tool and have never heard anything NOT played on MTV, it might actually impress your ignorant ass, you hot topic clone."
3,eh...its alright...,"Being honest, this isnt the best of this heavy rock band, but...it still has theyre edge. Sevendust has always been known for anger-drivin songs as ""Too Close to Hate"", with an occasional emotional rides as ""Live Again"". With this album, ""Seasons"" is NOT the best song on here, by far. But this cd is somewhat worth the buy if your a true Sevendust fan."
3,balls,"i think that the person who wrote that this cd is crap, listens to a lot of crap and therefore should be allowed no opnion on what rocks and does not rock. You put that evanescence is the greatest rock cd of 2003?!?!?! You wouldn't know rock if it jumped out your ass. The greatest rock album of 2003? Whatever, the greatest rock album of 2003 is there is no great rock album that came out in 2003! The deftones but it wasn't all that ROCK! THE DEFTONES JUST ROCK!!! anyway you're gay."
2,YET ANOTHER GREAT METAL BAND GONE SOFT,"Ok don't get me wrong i love SEVENDUST and there is nothing wrong with mellow metal BUT!!!!!!!!!!!! I cannot wait until a group will come out and not change their music style. i'm so sick of these bands drawing fans in with one type of music then going soft hmm hmm(creed,staind) just to name a couple others. I guess not all bands can be like OVERKILL who will never change their style for anything. I call it going from great to mediocre but then again the world is ruled by mediocracy uh? But anyway if you are a big SEVENDUST fan pick it up. If your a ""rock"" fan pick it up. If your a true to life metal fan (OVERKILL, TESTAMENT, SLAYER, JUDAS PRIEST) stay clear!!!!!!!!"
4,Easy Wheels,This cart handles very well and was easy to put together.It still has a very strong smell of petroleum so I store on the outdoor balcony.
1,junk cart,"this is the worst cart i have ever purchased. There is nothing sturdy about this cart. they say it would hold a hundred pounds or more, i dont trust it. the wheels are aleady peeling. The thing is so rickety--rackety and wobbly, iam afraid it is gonna break down on me. my husband has a small coastline cart, and it is way more sturdier than this piece of crap that i bought. never again would i put money on a shakey piece of crap like this cart. truly iam so sorry i wasted my time and money on this cart. it is not worth the money that they are asking for it. i would never purchase any of their products ever again."
4,My students love this book,"I first purchased this book several years ago. Since then, I have tried to use other ""daily oral language practice"" editing activities, but came back to this one. My students seem to really enjoy the ""detective work"" of finding errors in these interesting-to-read paragraphs. Each one is a simulation of a short newspaper article, and is accompanied by a picture with a caption; the students have to compare these with the text to see if there are any discrepancies. While students are looking for common mistakes in writing they tend to make, they are learning fun facts about animals, geology, and even history."
4,"Not bad, but not the best","Like anyone else who is perusing this product, I am most anxious for someone to lovingly place the Betty Boop collection out on DVD. It is gratifying to find a disc that contains most of the notable collaborations between Fleischer and contemporary pop stars, including Cab Calloway and Louis Armstrong. These are fine cartoons, just not the best. Anyone who was fortunate enough to come upon the vhs box from more than a decade ago is aware of some of the truly wild and mind melting efforts representing the earliest efforts featuring Betty. But until ""Bimbo's Initiation"" and ""Jippo"", etc. find their way into re-distribution, this collection will do."
5,a great look at a pre-code betty boop,"while i never cared that much for betty,my wife likes her and this disc of betty boop(most if not all were made be for the motion picture code was put into place in the 30's) is one she really likes to watch,and so we will cuddle up and enjoy these old but kind of racy cartoons from the past,and as such i don't think these are really ready for your kids yet! this is also something that real movie fans may want to add to their collections also!!"
1,Agree with previous poster,"Actually, we have the $11,000 Amigo II with Everest printer. Abysmal tech support at Rimage--expect an hour waiting and be glad if it's less. Even sales will keep you waiting. Major breakdown after only about 2000 burns over a period of eighteen months. Heavily marked up replacement parts. Total lack of sympathy. I would not buy from them again."
1,What is this?,How the heck do they expect to sell this if they do not say what port it is for?AGP or PCI Express??From the looks of the picture it seems like the PCI Express version.Can anyone confirm this?
3,Half and Half,"Very informative book for anyone who wants to learn about the stars, but where I got it from the person was not honest about the quality the book was in, very tattered, water warped, worn down, pages bent severely."
3,Good not Great...too,This was one of the two books I bought this semester and it was ok also same thing it was quite used and not too sturdy...it was the correct item and it arrived in a timely fashion. overall about 3.5 stars
2,Not enough show; too much tell.,"I'm the type of learner that has to see and do. I don't learn very well from reading or listening to lecture. I purchased this DVD thinking it would ""demonstrate"" the topics it advertised. Unfortunately, most of the DVD is a shot of the author standing behind a work table and talking. I kept waiting to see demonstrations of how things are done, but these were few and very far between. At the end, there were a few demonstrations, but it didn't make up for the rest of the DVD. In the ""wrap up"" the author mentioned his next DVD would be a ""projects"" DVD, suggesting that this is where the demonstrations will take place. Also, the audio was terrible. The production is more typical of YouTube rather than a professionally produced DVD.For anyone interested in actually seeing fused glass demonstrations, I would spend the $39 on a membership to Bullseye's online education videos. I wish I had gone there first."
5,Excellent,"This was my first Illenberger CD but certainly not my last. I wouldn't really call it new age, but I can understand why it is categorized as such. I would say it is more of a cross between new age and fusion jazz. This is an excellent disc, even if you are not a fan of the genre. Ralf is such a talented guitar player, writer and producer but always lets his band members shine. The great, multi-instrument playing, Budi Siebert being one of them. Every track on this disc, other than the rare Illenberger vocal track `You and I', is very good if not great. Track #10, `Quiet Morning', is one of the best music pieces I have ever heard. This disc ranks right up there with the other Illenberger discs that I own that include `Circle', `Heart and Beat', `The Gateway' and `Sedona' among others. Highly recommended."
3,Beginning of the end,"For me, Season 8 is about when ER heads downhill. I feel there's less focus on the medicine, and more on politics and interpersonal drama. Perhaps I'm also a little less drawn to the characters at this point in the series. Mostly I think it's an x-factor...I can't put my finger on the reason, but I'm less excited by the show. I tore through the earlier seasons, watching 2-3 episodes at a time, even though I'd seen them all before. Now that I've reached season 8, I'm happy watching one episode, and don't find myself in any hurry to start up the next one."
4,Me happy,"Item arrived promptly. Sound is great, easy to play, even my little brother is learning with it. Make sure you tune it before you start though."
3,NOT MUCH HELP,Don't expect too much from these Pedifix cushions but they do help somewhat. One size fits all but it really doesn't. Excellent Amazon service as usual.
2,"Works, but is not a 2x120W Amp","I opened the device up and discovered that one of the electrolytic caps had leaked. After cleaning the board, I looked at the chip that powered the amp. It was a STA450 which powers two channels each at just under 40W."
5,WOW!,"Michael Gettel is my music teacher, and, wow does he write great music! Recently I went on a two week trip with him to the Southwest, and got to see some of the places that inspired him to write the music for this fabulous CD. My personal favorite is Sipapu. It captures the atmosphere of the Southwest more than any other track. Even If you don't buy this CD, go to a music store and listen to it. I know you won't be dissapointed."
2,insight into life of a male model as well as Caroline,"Despite the fact that he is not a good writer, it is clear that the life of an aspiring male model is not glamorous -- even when he gets finally makes it big time (modeling Calvin Klein underwear). Carolyn Bessette comes across as a very needy young woman with problems, which Bergin does not have the ability or insight with which to cope); yet, when she finally sends strongerand ore tanglible signals that she is ready to move the relationship to a meaningful level,he sabotages the possibility of cememnting the relationship. Regardless of his declaration of how much he loved her, he realized at some level that this relationship was not about the kind of love that would ever end in happily ever after, and, managed to self protect against it, even if he wasn't aware he was so doing at the time. The author manages to convey convincingly what Carolyn was like before she married JFK Jr, demystifying the myth that became hers by virtue of her marriage."
1,Literary low point of the year,"This is one of the slimiest books I've ever seen. Michael Bergin claims to have loved Carolyn Besette yet he's proclaiming some extremely unflattering things about her in this poorly written book. The entire ""love story"" could've been told in an essay but Bergin chose to puff up his dull, repetitive tale to book length. Hopefully this book will go along the same lines as Bergins post Baywatch acting career."
1,"Pure Whacko, Leftist, Psycho-babble, Garbage!","Perhaps the ones who really need to be ""on the couch"" are the leftists who write and actually believe this baloney. The author has never met President Bush much less conduct any sessions with him. He engages in wild speculation/diagnosis based on unsubstantiated rumor and second/third hand information. Without the common motivation of intense hatred for the President that the author and his fans share, most would give him no credibility whatsoever. The American Medical Association has severely criticized Frank's methods and analysis as being completely bogus. Even his collegues think he's a ""goober"".Doesn't really matter. The right man for the job won by a majority of American's votes. That's reality so deal with it! Of course if you can't, you can always schedule an appointment with this author and engage in a mutual whining session."
1,Hatchet job,"Bush on the Couch: a first-rate psychoanalytical hatchet job. It took me less than 60 seconds to find a list of Dr. Frank's political campaign contributions and it came as no surprise to me that every donation, going back to 2000, went to Democratic candidates.President Bush dissents from Frank's view of the political world, and therefore science tells us that the president must be clinically insane."
2,Boop a droop,"This is not the product advertised. Amazon is not the only listing like this, though: have ordered this, with front and back-cover play-list scans, etc., et al., from others as well, only to receive the same package. This contains Crazy invention, candid candidate, ding dong doggie, hot air salesman, is my palm read?, judge for a day, a language all my own, a little soap and water, rhythm on the Reservation, training pigeons, we did it, ker-choo, indoor outing, little nobody, & making friends."
2,just ok,"a mariah carey knock-off track from Mary J.Bliege is how business goes nowadays.the song is lite in Production&Tone. vocally I can take or leave her now.this song is aight.glad to see her still doing good,but this track doesn't move me very much."
4,"Good Purchase - quick delivery, high quality media, great price.","This was purchased as a christmas gift for someone who was overwhelmed searching for an affordable copy of remembered music. The gift and subsequent lessons in how this was accomplished made for a great gift. The disk arrived a day before the predicted window for delivery, very professionally packaged and brought the desired joy at hearing the old favorites clear and digitallly crisp."
5,Amazing,Its very hard for me to understand the bad reviews that this book has gotten. Im not the type of person to write reviews but i feel that this book deserves a good review. Jesus Christ himself was hated so im not suprised that anyone that expresses truth would be hated also. The book and the concept of it is very good. The book is meant to erupt a hunger and yearning for Christ to help you get to another level of having a relationship with Christ. Its about seeking God's face and not His hands. Its about wanting God for who He really is and not for what He can do. Only those who truly hunger for God really appreciates this book. It all has to do with having a made up mind to radically serve God not caring about people ridiculing you but just understanding that God is most important. This book has truly been a blessing and will continue to Bless people.
5,Spiritual thirst,This book deepened my thirst for God's presence. The author gives his own experience with God's presence....and your just can't help but what he experienced. I read it through in 2 days....and loved it. I would recommend it for anyone who wants more in their Christian walk. If you want more of God in your life....then this is a great place to start.
3,"""Chase"" seems too much like work","One has to crystalize Tenney's main themes clearly to come to the conclusion that one agrees with his points. These themes are often hidden in the hype and one-liners common to the ""fried chicken circuit"" of the evangelists' beat. But amid these overused cliche's and metaphors there beats the heart of God. It is too easy for those of intellect to get bored with the reading and dismiss the hidden, but poignant, messages this age desparately needs to hear. Tenney also indicts with the same over-simplification that disguises the true import of his message. Reading Tenney has prompted me to read A.W. Tozer again, Tenney's admitted inspiration."
1,Are you joking?,"While I appreciated the author's sense of humor, this book is a joke. It could only possibly be for very young women (under age 24) who have time and good sense to waste. Any woman of good character would recognize a player and turn and walk away. Why waste time on men who are only interested in the conquest? This is total nonsense. Good for a laugh for college girls, but ladies over 24--don't waste your time or money."
4,Turning Point,"This collection shows a change in the style for this label. The first two collections have a style that evokes images of mysterious places. I often used the first two to read books by Tolkien or brooks.This collection still has some of that, but one can see a style where the music is less mysterious and mood evoking into a more mainstream style - one that is pleasant to listen to but evokes less ""mindscapes"".The first four of the Narada collections all have something to offer. After that it became too much like muzak"
3,Great CD,I was looking for 2 songs in this movie. The one of course Brown Eyed Girl and the other is Run Around Sue (I think). I see that Run Around Sue is not on this CD does anyone know who sings this song or the correct name of the song?
4,"Good read, but maybe too favorable","Recently, I've began reading a series of Presidential biographies. First I read ""Master of the Senate"" which is about LBJ. Next, I decided to read this book about Nixon.I found it to be a good read, although the author seems to make it his mission to rehabilitate Nixon a little too much. He makes guys like John Dean, H.R. Haldeman, and Bob Ehrlicman look like the main villians in Watergate, and gives too much credit to G. Gordon Liddy. It does a good job of following the major events in Nixon's life, and it does lack the anti-Nixon bias that many Americans, myself included, have towards the 37th President.I recommend the book, but I do warn you that it may be a little to pro-Nixon for some people."
3,HoMedics Ortho Therapy Lumbar Cushion Support Pillow,"Comfortable, but it not thick enough for persons with bulging disk issues in my opinion. The issue is that the pillow compresses to approximately 2 inches thick when it's on your back while you're seated."
2,"too soft, doesn't support","This product does not offer enough strong support in the lumbar area. It crumbles down upon leaning on it, leaving the back upsupported."
2,The strap is horrible! It doesn't fit anything!,"I ordered this because the reviews said it was comfortable.It lacks in one area - the strap is NOT ADJUSTABLE! Therefore, the strap will NOT hold this pillow to a car seat, office chair, etc. The strap will only go over an item that is no wider than the pillow itself, about 12 inches.So if your chair or seat is wider than 12"", forget the pillow!The comfort is there though, if you can get it to stay on your chair!!!"
3,Doesn't go around chair,"I'm using this for my chair at work and the elastic band in the back won't fit around the back of the chair. I spend too much time re-positioning it. It was comfortable, but I didn't notice much difference in back pain at the end of the day."
4,Great pillow and great price,"I bought this pillow because I needed to drive across the country and it worked really well. I drove for more than 12 hours a day without any lower back pain. The only thing I did notice was some minor pain in my upper back from sitting up so straight. I don't think that was specific to this pillow, though. It's probably something that happens with many lower back support pillows because your upper back can't really rest against the seat. Or maybe, my back was tired because I'm usually sitting with bad posture and this is the first time I sat how I am suppose to for long periods of time. Either way, I would still recommend this pillow."
1,Hard As A Rock............,"This is very hard. Its awful. I am returning it. I'm 5'3"" Does not hit my back in the right place."
4,Still has use,"I loved the product and still uses it from time-to-time when I am traveling long distances. It still retained its shape even after several months on being in a compressed condition. Way to go, HoMedics."
3,works ok,"I bought this for lumbar support while sitting on the couch. It's comfortable, and helps my posture, but has ""squashed"" down a lot, and hasn't kept its shape. It also moved/slid around behind me, but we recently got leather furniture, and it seems to stay in place better than with the old, upholstered couch."
4,Good for the price,"The memory foam back pillow is in good quality. A good deal for the price. The band used to attach the pillow to the chair is not very tight. Anyway, it is a good pillow."
3,Too thick & fat & large,This product is too large to fit on my lower back & be used as lumber support. It is too thick & pushes me forward in the chair & the thickness creates a 3 inch distance between my upper back & back of the chair. The product should have been made about 1 to 1.5 inch thinner so you can have your lumber support as well as you can lean your upper back to the chair.
4,Makes my office chair more comfortable!,"I purchased this lumbar cushion to use with my office chair at work. I immediately noticed a difference not just in the way I sit in my chair, but it has helped me to improve my posture also. The cushion cover is made of a very soft, durable material and is easily washable. It does get a bit warm sometimes though, which is when I just have to lean forward for a few minutes to let some air flow through the cushion. I usually sit at a desk all day in front of a computer, so this helps with my posture which is important to me because I also have carpel-tunnel syndrome. I truly enjoy using it everyday and without it, my back would be hurting by noon and I would constantly be re-adjusting my chair to get comfortable. Now that I have this lumbar cushion, it makes the end of the day great because my back is not in pain! I also recommend it for the car if your driver's chair is uncomfortable."
1,Too soft for me as well.,I am 6 feet tall and weight 185 pounds. It just does not provide enough support. But to be honest I should have know as its memory foam. I have a memory foam bed and after a while this stuff does not hold up. I am returning mine.
1,Not good,The real problem here is in the design. Memory foam should not be used for a lumbar pillow because after 10 minutes of using it it just compresses and becomes flat as a pancake. Then all the lumbar support is gone. The only time it is any good is first thing in the morning when its been sitting in my car all night and its cold outside. Then it is is firm enough to offer support. But that lasts only about 10 min. I will have to buy another. I hope to return this one.
2,lumbar,Purchased for pregnant daughter and height was too high and extremely hard. unable to use. made situation worse. great price but not comfortable
2,Just ok,"These don't hold their shape very well, and therefore dont provide the best support. They are better than nothing, but could be better"
3,Doesn't work for car,Bought this for long car trips and doesn't work. Too big on the sides. So i had to shave it down with my knife and it ended up working better then nothing. The thing is just too big.
4,Not just a gay thriller!,"Gavin Shaw is the sex-driven hero who experiences one erotic/exotic encounter after another in this ""pacy, sexy, thriller."" Shaw, a journalist, lives (or exists) merely for sex. One day he discovers that he has the opportunity to make a pile of money by exposing an international capitalist who has acquired his wealth by suspicious means. That is the framework of the story. Unless the reader completes the book, he will not discover that The Masters File is a type of apprenticeship novel wherein the main character undergoes a journey of self-realization as to who and what he is. The picture Gavin presents to the reader as well as to himself makes the story more than just a series of prurient homosexual encounters.I would have given the author a five if he had developed this theme a little better towards the conclusion, but, as is, The Masters File is well worth reading as more than just an exercise in gay sexual encounters."
4,Another Quality release from Friedemann,"I am totally baffled by the dismal review listed here. Did you listen to the same CD I did? I have all of the Friedemann releases and yes Indian Summer is the best. BUT, all three of his Narada releases are some of the best ever released in this particular genre. Both Legends of Light and to a lesser extent Aquamarine have quality, stellar moments and are totally worthwhile listening experiences.Methinks you are a little too picky. It reminds me of my former self when I was such a nitpicky critic I only had a few handfulls of releases that I considered grade worthy. Over time it became glaringly apparent that I couldn't keep listening to the same old stuff over and over and over so I lightened up and expanded my horizons. These days I enjoy HUNDREDS of CD's of various genres."
2,Vegetarian equals Whole Foods????????,"This is a VEGETARIAN book with one recipe for chicken breast.There is no milk, no eggs, no yogurt unless you want to count putting a dollop of yogurt on top of a bean burrito.I researched what ""whole foods"" means and this book is NOT it.This is a vegetarian SOY BEANS book.She uses tofu, tempeh, soy milk, tamari, and shoyu ALOT!The book starts out great telling me everything I wanted to hear about changing eating habits and how our diets need to be more whole foods, but then she has a recipe for imitation meat products made from ""PROCESSED"" wheat flour gluten. Please.....And then she recommends you read the labels of the cereals in the store and pick a good one! There are no good ones! That's why I bought the book. Duh!If you want to read about whole foods, read Nourishing Traditions book by Sally Fallon. I was just looking for kid-friendly recipes that uses grains, etc, and this wasn't it."
5,Outstanding guitar music.,"I am a guitar music lover, and basically Rumba-Flamenco is my favorit music, so I actually enjoy the whole CD content."
5,wow.,"I saw Todd in concert at a Summer Jam. It was just him and the guitar, and it was amazing...Grace Like Rain (the song) is such a wonderful combination of an old hymn (Amazing Grace) with Todd's wonderful songwriting ability.Fragile Breath is a very moving, powerful song.After hearing it on the radio, I'll sing it all day.I have not yet ordered the cd, though i plan on it very soon.I promise if you buy this album, you will not be disappointed."
5,Leave it in the CD changer because you'll play it a lot,"I don't know what it is about these Narada collections but they are really addictive. I have the Guitar (1) and the first Narada Decade sets and with this Wilderness set, they never leave the cd player.The artists are all masters of the genre; I especially like Tingstad and Rumbel, Brewer and Arkenstone, but all of them blend well together and don't ""clash"" on the cd. The compositions chosen are sometimes the best and here's the funny thing; I found several artists I really like on these cd's and when I purchased their albums, I found I liked THIS cd better. Why? It's the best of the best. If you like New Age composers like John Tesh, you may like this even better."
4,Great jazz cd..,Diana Krall is one of the best artists out there today.Each song is worth the purchase of the cd.
5,Supreme Jazz.,"Supreme voice and piano. I first heard Diana Krall on a Saturday afternoon PBS radio show called ""Praire Home Companion"" in which she sang ""I don't stand a Ghost of a Chance with you"" from her Love Scenes CD and I was so impressed. We went out and bought that CD that day. Since then we have bought all of her CD's and have seen her perform. Diana Krall is one of the best jazz performers I have ever had the privilage to hear. I highly recommend the CD When I Look Into Your Eyes; it is wonderful! And I recommend ALL Diana Krall Cd's available. We listen to her Cd's every night during dinner."
3,Diana Krall - Eyes,Diana has a wonderful voice and there are some beautiful songs on this CD but it did not live up to my expectations. The arrangements seem different from many of her previous recordings.
4,Very Good,"This recording of Diana is, like you'd expect, excellent. I personally like ""All For You"" much more, but if you like Diana this is a must album."
4,Johnny Mandel's arrangements make the difference.,"Johnny Mandel is the finest arranger of the 20th century. Listening to this CD, you can readily pick ou those selections where Mandel has delivered the very finest in arranging beautiful standards."
1,It must be me!,"Please people, this beautiful young lady has a five note range, cannot sing more than three words without taking a breath, and from time to time sings off key. I can only assume that if you are still buying Ms. Krall's CD's that you already own all of Ella's recordings."
3,Not too bad,"I appreciate Ms. Krall's efforts to continue the legacy of a jazz vocalist. As a pianist, she soars. Meanwhile, her voice leave room for improvement. Her phrasing is quite bland, lacking Vaughan/Fitzgerald vibrato and melodic exploration. Her song choice had me longing for variety, while her song stylings did not ameliorate this situation. I found myself thinking that I had listened to each song already during it's first rotation in my player.Too bad such great songs seemed monochromatic under the light of her pale voice. Buy if you are in the mood for standard jazz club singer accompanied by great pianist."
2,Uninspiring and utterly disappointing,"Wow, am I disappointed after finally buying this CD. Other Amazon reviews and Grammy award nominations made me put my gut instinct aside and take the plunge. Not only is there virtually no passion in her voice, the clarity, inspiration and energy that so characterizes her personality on the Live In Paris CD, for example. is utterly lacking in this studio composition.The arrangements are pleasant, for sure. Let's Face the Music and Dance and the title song try to create an atmosphere, that's why 2 stars instead of 1. I am contrasting Diana's work simply against her other CDs, not against other performers.The lyrics are a joke, repetitive, simple, uninspiring. The voice is smooth, yet lacks any passion or interest even. Skip this one, unless you just have to have every Diana Krall CD in your collection. Commercial interests won over artistic expression in this one, and it shows."
2,Tired of Looking into your eyes,After listening to this CD more than a dozen times I came to realize that Irene Kral was a much more versatile vocalist. This album from Diana is alright but it gets boring after awhile.
2,Don't believe the hype.,"Diana Krall isn't doing anything Shirley Horn doesn't do better..considerably better. Johnny Mandel's string arrangements sounded lush behind Horn, not treacly and pallid , as they do on this wannabe CD. Why not buy Shirley's string album, paste a picture of Sharon Stone on the cover and have the best of both worlds?"
3,She's amazing but stepped away from her solid jazz,"Diana Krall is a wonderful vocalist and jazz performer BUT, sorry, strings have no place in today's jazz (yeah, I'm a purist and not everyone will agree with me here, that's OK). Strings were fine for Paul Whiteman maybe, but not Diana. The glitz of fashion is OK, everyone oughta be able to wear what they want!She's so smooth and her performance, even though it was hampered by the ""orchestra"" is still wonderful. Maybe next time she'll use more solid bass, piano, etc. she's close to perfect with those instruments backing her and she's still got one of the best voices for jazz around."
4,Great album...if you're in the mood.,"Great CD, but you have to be in the mood to listen to mellow music to thoroughly enjoy it. Worth the investment though."
1,She can't sing,"Diana Krall has no chops! I know this is harsh, but come on. In the old days they used to record these songs using people who could sing. Diana Krall doesn't sustain a line and has no dynamic range. In fact, she sounds like she's struggling somtimes -- it's painful to listen to. Obviously talent is a disadvantage when it comes to Grammy contests, record sales, etc. I guess people don't want to listen to those who really have a gift for singing. Perhaps it makes people feel bad if they have less talent than a performer, so instead they choose to listen to ordinary-at-best perfomers like Diana Krall."
5,Oh - - - My - - - God,"Most of the reviews will tell you how wonderful every track is, and they are absolutely correct. However, the most amazing thing about this album is the production quality. I have seldom heard such a wide sound field with such detail. Kudos to Tommy LiPuma, Al Schmitt and Avatar Studios. OK, maybe I have decent ""kit"" but I can't stress enough how wonderful this CD sounds. I'm listening to it as I write and it just makes me tingle. The down side is that many of my once ""great"" albums now sound restricted, compressed and over processed in comparison with this work of art.Diana, thank you for many hours of joy.Just buy it. 'nuff said."
4,Enjoyable thriller,"Ben Bova at his typical good. This is another Dan Randolph thriller, written in 2005 to do some of the back story in the Grand Tour (Dan Randolph is the main character in Privateers and Empire Builders and appears in the first books the Asteroid Wars tetralogy). It also sets the stage for his off-and-on relationship with Jane Thornton Scanwell. It kept me reading, but the characters are shades of gray (better than solely black and white) but definitely not technicolor. An enjoyable confection, but not a meal."
2,Hardly worth reading,"I'm not sure what book the reviewers who gave this book 5 stars were reading, but it sure wasn't the same one I read. There was hardly in ""Science"" in this Science Fiction book. I'm not sure what I would call this book - Perhaps a sappy Romance? I found the entire book ""double damned"", to use Dan's often repeated phrase."
2,very boring,This book never got off the ground..Characters never developed...Author tried to put too much Louisiana names and stuff in book and needed to concentrate more on the character and plot which were poor..
3,Copper Clad Cookware,Have been only using the non stick pan. The food gets stuck and is difficult to clean.
2,not too happy,"I purchased two pair of these glasses back in January. I travel about 80% of the time so they have not been used too much. Yesterday I went to play a game of racquetball and the glasses fell apart on me. I have no idea why, took them out of locker and a split from the top of the nosepiece straight up to the frame. Not fixable. I looked at the second pair I purchased at the same time, and the same thing is happening to that item too.I have probably worn these less than 90 minutes each, so certainly not worth the money."
5,best racquetball glasses ever,"the only glasses that do NOT fog up, and keeps great visibility. will never use another pair of racquetball glasses."
4,"Great overall, but experienced same splitting problem","I absolutely loved these goggles, while they lasted. Super clear and with no fogging whatsoever. Like other reviewers though, mine split right down the middle under the nose piece as well. I still give them four stars however because (unlike others), my split was caused by a point blank direct hit to the spot of the break. My nose and eyes are in tact, goggles, not so much."
5,Adventure Frozen In The Cold War,"Without a doubt one of the finest post-Pendelton Executioner books ever. This second generation Mack Bolan thriller takes the hero into the Soviet Union in the dead of winter. The attention to detail and the descriptive narrative will delight most any action-adventure buff.Suspensful from cover to cover, all the characters are believable and authentic to their time. The plot is more credible than most of the series and will please even the most jaded of readers of this genre. If you can find a copy, read Ice Cold Kill as soon as you can, you'll be glad you did."
2,Repair needed with heating/AC electrical,"I am sorry to report that this manual was of no help in solving my problem. (I had sudden failure of the blower motor). I expected the wiring diagram for the heating/AC system to show some relays that could be the cause. I assume that one of the five existing relays under the hood would be to control this system, but I could not find any diagram showing these. There was little help, useful to me, on this particular portion of the heating/AC system. After replacing the resistor, and checking out the blower motor I eventually replaced the 'on/off' speed switch and that solved the problem."
3,For die hard fans only.,"I have more than ten Ellington DVDs and this is my least favorite. This is not the best dvd to hear Ellington's Band. The fault mostly is with the sound crew who miked the band and mixed the show so poorly. The Bassist is hard to hear, and throughout most of the show, the drummer's ride cymbal is the most prominent sound you hear. Even over the rest of the drums. The brass sections are out of balance. Also, when most of the soloists begin playing, their mics were turned off for several seconds until the sound crew figured it out. This also happened when Duke was speaking. Still it is good to see the guys performing in the later years of the band. But if you a looking for a DVD to see, hear and learn about Ellington,A Duke Named Ellington, is a much better place to start."
2,Better books out there,"This book wasn't as helpful as I was hoping it would be. I have a premie that was 6 weeks early and in the NICU for 5 1/2 weeks. We didn't get the opportunity to nurse until she came home. I had latching issues and low milk supply, so we needed to supplement with formula. This book makes you feel bad for using formula and giving bottles."
2,Be prepared for a judgmental approach...,"To be fair, I have only started reading the book, but I don't know that I will finish it. WOW am I finding it very judgmental! The author clearly takes the approach that if you are unable or unwilling to breastfeed you are a bad parent and your child is doomed to a life of illness and the two of you will never bond. I am currently expecting our first child and the tone of the author was making me so upset that my husband actually took the book away from me for the sake of my blood pressure!"
5,Best Nursing book found so far,"I loved the research and practical help and preferred it over LaLecheLeague books and other experts. Was recommended by my midwife and helped with nursing issues I had with second child. Great one stop shop, natural approach. Bought it for first time mom as shower gift. Highly recommend it."
4,Hidden Jewel,"I heard ""Dreaming of You"" earlier this year, via internet radio...I was impressed enough to look up the recording and order it on Amazon. Strangely enough, I didn't realize I'd heard Lauria play live, during Pat Metheny Group's ""The Way Up"" Tour.Novo Brasil is a wonderful recording for easy-going listening (Saturday Morning drives, etc.). Lauria's playing is very proficient and lyrical; kinda like Steve Khan.I can see why he has joined a long line of talented musicians who have accompanied the Pat Metheny Group. Enjoy!"
2,disappointing - unless mine was defective,"I was pretty excited after reading the reviews and Quizzard looked like a very neat entertaining toy. However, when I received it, I was disappointed by the short demo. While the crystal ball was really cool with its effects, I didn't like that you could answer the questions incorrectly and there was no indication that you were wrong. I'm all for positive reinforcement, but I didn't really like that no distinctions were made at all for wrong vs. right answers. So I opened the toy to see if this was just a limitation of the demo and so I could check out the alternate settings. After several attempts at trying the other functions and using the setting displayed in the demo, I never once saw the crystal ball work during normal play. (only in demo did it do its thing) Very confusing. Maybe I got a dud - but I was definitely not impressed. This is a toy that had alot of potential but just didn't meet my standards for an educational toy."
3,unique toy,my 2 & 1/2 year old can't play with Quizard on his own. It is a clever learning toy. The amount of information is limiting but more cards are sold for variety. I think it will be great as he gets older.
4,Must read for building stone walls,I thought this book was really put together good. It has step by step and detailed instructions on how to build stone walls. If you are looking to do stone work I suggest buying this book.
4,Un buon manuale,"Un buon manuale che analizza in maniera dettagliata le tecniche costruttive con la pietra, in modo particolare con la tecnica del metodo ""casuale"". Un libro che comunque è rivolto a chi ha già un minimo di esperienza in tale metodica costruttiva,e che offre spunti di riflessione anche su come debbano avvenire certi tipi di restauro o di recupero."
5,TERROR!!!,"This is a fantastic album made by some really cool folks. If you're into science fiction, horror movies, punk, metal, fun, pizza, etc. you will like it a lot. If you are into being a stupid jerk you will probably hate it. Freaking swell!"
1,Terrible,"I had never heard of this band, but Dawn of the Dead kept playing on Pandora for me. I really liked it and decided to buy this album. Turns out that was the only good song on the whole thing. Despite a bunch of kitschy titles this is really nothing but sad-girl angst rock; including brilliant songs about how the singer is sad about life, sad about the boy and sad because she's not stupid but someone thinks she is.. Absolutely terrible."
5,EXCELLENT!!!!Very Entertaining The BEST!!!!!!,"This really helps children to read and it has a catchy song that goes with it that kids love to sing. It is very educational and i am glad i bought it. Also, all leap frog learning products are great , too. Very satisfied with purchase, well worth it's money in gold.5 star*****"
5,VENEZUELA & NORWAY,"Be sure to get one copy of this MARVELOUS album created by this talent.Sax player,keyboardist,composer (In a unique way) and Singer,Bendik gets a very intelligent pop,coloured by the production of the great Mike mainieri (Ex-collaborator in Steps ahead project)I live in Venezuela and i earn my living as a record producer,and this album really blow my head in 1991."
4,Very important message in this movie...,"This movie (I watched it through instant streaming) has vital information about the horrible ways that we have treated (and continue to treat) marine mammals in captivity. From the beginning, it explains the brutal ways that mammals like Lolita and the many ""Shamu"" whales have been captured. I am an avid fan of marine mammals and read much about them and their bioligy. But a lot of the information presented here, specifically about Orcas, was new to me.I encourage you to watch it and prepare to be saddened and shocked. Get angry...and then get motivated to do something about the horrors you see here."
5,Grace and Seven Children,"For several days, they read the book together, Grace and seven children. They prayed. By Monday, Amy (11) memorized the passage. They believed what they were praying.At 3 AM on Wednesday, a car crashed into their house. ""You must have been praying"", said an officer. ""At that speed, it should have been fatal."" The car side-swiped one tree, then another before it touched the ground and slid into the house.Each child described for me their shock of being awakened by the crash. Each associated the influence of their praying like Japez to the miracle of that night. Two weeks later they recognized the driver visiting their church.I believe my grandchildren and their mother stepped outside the routine of their daily lives into the enlarged territory God lets us experience when we ask for it.Granddaddy"
4,Strictly beginner level ....,"Unless you live on the west coast, getting yourself trained in tabla is quite a pain. This book gives a good start but is quite basic. For such a magical and culturally rich instrument, training should be more widely available to the masses. For the cost of this book, one should be able to take online lessons for the whole year.India needs to subsidize resources that make its rich culture more accessible to Indians all over the world."
1,Total POS,"This thing is a total ""piece"". I was so excited that I had this great device when my wife's car battery died. So, I plugged it in and started charging. 10 minutes later, I tried to start the car with no luck. The battery on her car wasn't even that dead, as the a/c, radio, headlights, and all the lights still worked. I kept it plugged in for another 20 minutes - total 30 minutes now. Still no start. I borrowed jumper cables from a nearby motorist - the car started immediately.So, I get home and start reading reviews and learn that several news stations have targeted this device and tested on there programs with several different cars at different stages of being dead. It failed every test. An auto expert on one the shows said ""I have yet to see one of these work.""What a POS."
1,Junk,"Received as a gift, this thing is junk. There's a reason that your standard jumper cables are almost a centimeter thick, each. A LOT of power needs to be transferred to a dead battery. Not only is the size of the cable here too small, but it connects through the lighter - that normally uses an even SMALLER wire gauge behind the dash. That amount of power transfer is not intended to go through a lighter plug and dash wire. For benefit of the doubt, I tried it and let it sit for *30 minutes* to charge a very small car battery. Did it transfer power? Yes. Was it enough power to start the dead car? No. The general theory of this product is sound, but the actual application is a failure."
1,Got jipped,The dvds are supposed to be 4 discs with 1 ga1 game each. I got 3 games and 1 copy of the wrong game!!!?!!?
4,Metal Slug advance,"Metal slug is a great game with good graphics, and music. It's an action packed shooter, with cool enimeis and great expsoshins. i reccomend this game for a metal slug fan, or a shoot em up fan. The only reason i gave this game 4 stars is because you die to easily and the bosses can get a little annoying."
3,why bother?,"Good stuff, but why pay the extra money for extra tracks version? It's the same cd with one of the songs redone ""live"". Big deal. I never cared for live tracks anyway."
1,"Wasn't good to begin with, and now its almost useless","This book had a few good things, like some training activities and basic strategies, but much of the info was wrong like how the plasma I's work or some of the ship stats in the back of the book. Now that the game has went through so many revisions to fix bugs and balance the game, the book is completely lacking or incorrect for most of it's information. No info on Plasma D's since they are new, and the ship information in the back is even more incorrect. Don't waste your time with this one. Wait for an updated version."
5,Absolute must-have for anyone interested in addictions,"I was assigned this book for my Biopsychosocial aspects of addictions course in grad school for counseling. This is definitely a book I will not be selling back. It is extremely reader-friendly and offers great insight into the way addicts think. Twerski does a fabulous job of explaining addictive behavior and cognitive processes as well as explaining codependency. Whether you're in school and studying addictions, just curious about the topic, or have an addict in your life, I strongly recommend reading this book."
3,Not exactly what you see,"In the picture this looks nice and sleek flat grinder. It is triangler shaped,3 dimentional and larger than it appears, but it actually works well."
3,every band has it's high point and ministrys is pslam 69,"well this is only for die hard fans, yea it's good i mean it is ministry. however i have been a fan since 88 and know what is what with this band. If i was recommending albums to buy i would say get land of rape and honey, mind, and pslam 69 and stop there....."
2,"Better than filth pig, not as good as Psalm 69 or The Mind..","Though better than Filth Pig, Ministry's new album is a far cry from earlier albums. It is a more evloved filthpig with slightly mellower tones. Songs often imitate the style of many of ministry's side projects like the RevCo or LARD, ocassionally even 1000 homo dj's. Supermatic Soul, Eureka Pile, and Nursing Home in my opinion are the best tracks that express ministry's earlier spirit, but have your finger ready on the skip button. Rumors are also circulating about a US tour following their europe tour after the release of this album, so there's a good thing."
4,FINALLY...a new album...chock full of atmosphere too,"Coming three years and almost five months since FILTH PIG, DARK SIDE OF THE SPOON has finally arrived. It actually shares an element with PINK FLOYD's THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON...its ethereal atmosphere. Don't worry...there are still angst driven tracks like SUPERMANIC SOUL and the blistering BAD BLOOD. There is a hidden track on track 69 (of course) and according to www.ministry.nu it's called LINDA SUMMERTIME. The artwork is a little vile and I don't even want to know what the hell is pictured under the cd. Ministry fans should get this one if they haven't already. Die hard fans would rate 5 stars. I gave it 4 stars because PSALM 69 is their magnum opus."
2,one star for every good song on it.,"I sold this cd a week after I bought it. I like industrial music to kick as.s. Supermanic soul and Bad blood are the only songs on here that kick any as$ at all and they are both on the greatest fits cd along with other kick @$$ ministry songs. If you're like me don't buy it. There are two kinds of industrial music fans, the angry ones and the whiny ones. there are whiny songs all over this cd and alot of stupid humor crap and a jazz-ish song and saxafones and banjos and it sucks. I think they should have quit after filth pig, but supermaniac soul is one of my favorite songs ever so whatever. at least you can get it used for 2 dollars, so get it I guess."
5,"one of their best--and that's coming from a Music fan, not a Ministry fan","I'm not a Ministry Fan. I'm a Music fan. I bought Psalm 69, and it's got some great tunes, but not everything on Psalm impresses me. This one's got spunk and creativity in every song. You don't have any Hot Rod For Jesus that's just there for Shits and Giggles. Step, the closest thing to Hot Rod, actually has a soul and point to it. Nursing Home and Eureka Pile are some of the most richly atmosphere songs these guys have done. Supermanic Soul and Kaif show off the band's fervor for minimalism. I never thought two power cords could be so unnerving and--yes--manic! Whip and Chain and Bad Blood are more traditional/ Cooperish dark ballads, but they're the best of their kind, so I'm happy! Then Vex and Silence just comes out of another world!It makes my Ministry A-List, to which I also add The Mind is A Terrible Thing to Taste, Land of Rape and Honey and Twitched."
1,"Good at acting, but singing????????????????","I've never been much of a fan of hers, I'm still not. The album is pretty boring to me and sadly I didn't expect anything else. She's a good actress, I'll give her that, but the music stinks. You can tell artists who lack true talent because by their second or third album they'll have turned to the old (...)...need i say more???? Looks will only get you so far Christina1"
2,Heats quickly...whistle is beyond awful,"Picked up the ""onyx""-colored one at Bed Bath & Beyond (same price as Amazon), after seeing this kettle recommended in ""The Week"" magazine for having a nice whistle. Stylish design..Put it on our gas stove and it heated quickly but the whistle is terrible! When it's about to go off, it sounds like someone gradually whistling from a low note to an ear-piercing high note. Drives us and our Golden insane: it honestly almost hurts your ears. Plus, the handle and ""trigger"" to pull the spout up is made of plastic and both were warm, almost hot to the touch after it came to a boil.Per the other reviews, I could see the plastic melting on this. Maybe it's not designed for gas stoves. (We were using one of the largest burners, I guess...)Great looking kettle and fast-heating but considering the reviews about parts melting (causing the whistle to stop working after a while), plus the insanely loud noise it makes, we're taking this one back."
1,Very dissappointed,"My 3 1/2 year old son received this toy as a gift. He absolutely loves Diego and bowling, so the combination of the two created a very excited little boy when he opened the gift. The size is smaller than the box appears, but that's not the major problem. He played with it (under close supervision) for only an hour or two before it broke. The pins jammed and one broke. And now when we turn it on it makes a constant annoying cranking sound. I have one very dissappointed little boy."
2,"Perhaps interesting to flip through, but it won't get you anywhere","Milena Minkova's INTRODUCTION TO LATIN PROSE COMPOSITION is a brief handbook to the general principles of writing in that language. Besides covering the basics of sentence construction, Minkova even give examples of the vaster rhetorical tricks employed by various classical writers. Examples abound for each point, though sadly they are not cited.While none of the information inside is exactly wrong, the book will probably prove unusable to most interested readers. There are no exercises, so students can't gradually build up their skills chapter by chapter. The production of the book is amateur, with poor typesetting and limited editing. If you actually want to learn to actively write in Latin, the standard textbook remains BRADLEY'S ARNOLD LATIN PROSE COMPOSITION, which in spite of its age is extremely rigorous, getting you on the path to comfortable expression in Latin in no time."
2,For class...,"I had to get this book for class and it was OK. It was dense and hard to follow, but the information that was presented was interesting."
4,afro-american history,"I love this book; the history of africa is diverse and cyclical, and proud like a lion"
4,Touch Not The Occult,"Linnea Quigley, Michelle Bauer and Brinke Stevens are the most unattractive and unpopular girls on campus (believe it or not). But then they get a hold of a crystal ball and hold a seance.Well, the girls become possessed by a succubus and proceed to strut around naked trying to seduce the guys. Some of the guys manage to maintain their cool despite the female heat and enlist an exorcist (a great character) to help restore the girls.A simple plot and really just an excuse for plenty of feminine nudity, but still fun to watch even when the ladies aren't on screen. The exorcist is a real hoot as is the almost comedic medium who angers the occult in the opening scene.Beautiful girls, funny characters and some bad acting with corny lines still manages to add up to a worthwhile package. Check it out."
5,aqua filter,"I bought this for our turtle, which is quite dirty. This is the best filter we have ever had. Easy to install and self priming, which is really great. So far it is cleaning very well although the turtle is basically in hibernation. Can't wait to see how it does in the summer. I would recommend this, especially if you have turtles.angie"
2,Defective Thermometer,"The face of the item is very nice and the clock worked fine. The thermometer is part of the same plastic unit as the hanging hook. If you straightened the unit, it moved the thermometer. The thermometer itself never moved on its own. I was surprised at how flimsy the ""works"" on the back were. Returned it the next day. Too bad - it was pretty."
5,Good stuff.,"This product is a bit long in the tooth, but it is invaluable. Especially since Kenneth Clark wrote this. Its a good addition to my collection."
1,Mystery Science Theater 3000 REJECT!!,"This movie it to terrible even for MST3K.If you love B-Movies in handy cam form then you might like this.If you watch this movie, just remember that there is an end to it.If you are intoxicated it will help.Enjoy if you dare."
3,Not perfect,"Nice art for child's room. However, it does not depict T-rex as many encyclopedias do so my son (4 years old) disagrees with it. Not adhering well to wall either, but not falling off."
2,"An uninspired, mediocre effort from Terry Brooks","One would think that a professional writer would improve his/her craft over time, but in this book, Terry Brooks writes as if he absolutely must, in order to pay bills. Now don't get me wrong - I used to be a big fan of Terry Brooks (and his original 'Sword of Shannara' series), but now I see that he's become mighty fat and lazy. The book reads as if he wrote this in his sleep, making up the characters and plots as he went along, rehashing bits of his previous efforts. Don't waste your time and money on this - I recommend Stephen Donaldson's 'Thomas Covenant' series, if you haven't yet read it."
4,A superb followup to a FANTASTIC series.,"As a die hard reader of fantasy fiction I've come acrosssome extraodinary series. David Eddings, Tracy Hickman andMargaret Weis, and Robert Jordan all have, in my eyes attempted to match the epic fictional works of Tolkien. Terry Brooks has done so, and where the Silmarillion has fallen short on the history of Middle Earth, Scions does the Shannara series justice as a prelude to original trilogy.Brooks uses the same flair for describing his characters to emphasize the differences between generations as he has always done to impress this reader in his earlier books. Settings as tangible as any in real life fill the imagination as the Four Lands unfold in greater and richer detail with each volume in the Shannara series.Ultimately it comes down to this: I was disappointed that the book had to end and wait breathlessly for the next in the fabulous Shannara series"
3,What you see is what you get...,"This piece is very difficult to review. You will open the pouch, and be neither disappointed nor excited. The design is lovely, and if the craftsmanship were a little better, I would have more to say. The groves in the flower are very shallow, giving the necklace an overall flat look. It is a nice piece, but something more appropriate for a young teenager than an adult."
3,aerator shoes review,"These shoes ork but your feet don't stay in the designated area of the sandals & need to be periodically adjusted. The rear shoe, backstop should be higher to keep your heel from going up over top of the shoe stop."
1,Useless,"Hard to strap on, diffcult to walk with them. If the lawn is dry they wont penetrate. If the lawn is wet they pick up chunks of grass."
2,"Ok, but Armik is the best!!!","I listned to this cd. its ok. the mElodies are ok, not that good. sort of close to flamenco. Very close to it. I know this is not pure flamenco, but the tunes should be there. Only one or two are nice. rest just goes on. I suggest that people who like this type of music should try Armik. He is really a genius in composing. He makes melodies. he is out of this world. He make pure melodies. No thrash. He is really a professinal. His music really has passion. the guitar sort of begs wanting something which captures in your heart. Try him, you will forget oscar and everybody else. He is the master composer!!!"
5,Best All Around Sports Medicine Book on Amazon,Hands down the best All Around Sports Medicine Book on on the planet. Contains a well organized index and easy to read diagnosis and treatment protocols.
2,Beautiful but TINY,"Had to return these because they are too tiny. basically 1/4 ct TOTAL weight means both earrings together. Not bad for a 2 year old girl, a nose ring or extra ear rings but not really practical for regular ear rings."
1,Worst Customer Service ever,"by mistake they put a wrong price on this item and i brought it, after they canceled my order even in my amazon account, it was 3 days ago and i still waiting my refund. i write them and amazon customer service and nobody answers me. this is frustrating.Rafael..."
5,WONDERFUL SPIDER STRAINERS,"I had a hard time finding spider strainers locally, but FINALLY found them on Amazon.com. Wish I had stated there to begin with. These are indispensible to lift food items out of a pot. Martha Stewart introduced their use on her show. Now I use them all the time; handy gadgets!! I ended up buying these in two sizes."
2,Not like the picture,"The product is not the same color as the picture, the wire is gold and looks cheap."
2,Don't Follow These Bread Crumbs,"This movie was an epic fail. I am not normally a harsh critic and I hate to give a bad review especially for a movie that I myself chose to watch , but it was so bad that I could and did not even finish it."
4,Well Done,"Easy to read, easy to follow and very helpful. I would recommend this binder to any doing value-stream mapping and lean processing."
4,Best Komodo Dragon (plus other animals),"I have several books by Duy Nguyen and this one has the best designs. The animals are mustly bugs and arachnids but there are also a Komodo dragon and a gecko for example.The designs are pleasing to the eye (the Komodo dragon is my favorite) but most are not for people who have anything against cutting the paper. Some use more than one piece. I don't have a real problem with this.The only real problem I have is that some of the insects (i.e. praying mantis) have eight legs instead of six. It is common in origami to simplify an animal by reducing the number of legs. This is the first time I have encountered designs where there are too many legs.Still, as long as no one is counting, they are very nice designs and easy for children to do."
3,Not remastered since 2003,"This is a re-release of the 2003 remaster. Compared to the 199X release of this title, the 2003/2008 version is quieter, less ground loop hum, less distortion and not as punchy or biting as the earlier edition and these attributes are not necessarily positive. I could live with my 90's version no problem. THIS IS A CLASSIC, TOP 100 ROCK ALBUM. A must own disc for any hard rock fan. IF you own an older version, there is nothing new here. Nuff said."
2,Not worth buying.,I haven't been playing guitar very long but even I could tell when I first opened this up is was going to be a struggle. The neck was so out of whack it took me and a friend nearly 2 hours to set it up so that we could start playing. The guitar seemed to play OK until we realized the front pickups were only working a 1/3 of the time. if you switched to the fronts only it would cut out for minutes at a time. At that point I boxed it up and sent it back to Amazon. Probably the worst purchase I have made on Amazon and let's say I have made MANY! I am definitely going to spend more $$ on the next one in hopes to get something really nice!
3,broken!,I purchased this guitar for my husband who is a beginning player. i read all the reviews before and they all seemed to love this guitar. however as soon as i pulled it out of the box i noticed the strings were pulled away from the neck i turned it over and noticed the two screws that connect the neck were broke off and in the bottom of the box it had been shipped in. I am not a happy camper. i have not yet contacted the company but i am planning on it. just beware! don't expect this item to be in good condition. Im sure that replacing the screws won't be a big deal but when u purchase for good money i personally dont excpect to be shipped a few broken off screws placed in the bottom of the box...they didnt break by being shipped!
3,Paulownia wood for the guitar????,"First of all, Paulownia wood is from the fastest grown tree in the world, sometimes call the princess tree, or the lady empress because of it's flowers...... There is nothing exotic about the wood used to produce this guitar , in fact it is cheap because of it's ability to be grown relatively fast."
2,Poor job for great band,"the guitar tribute to the foo fighters was done poorly. it is not what i expected, i expected it to be even close to what the actual songs sounded like. you can barely understand what your listening to for some songs...""monkeywrench"" is a great example...i didnt know what song i was listening to until it got part where dave screams ""one last thing before i quit..."" some of the songs are done good though, for example, ""low"", it sounds really good. all my life sounds ok, but i wouldnt recomend this cd unless you are an avid foo fan and just want to build on your collection of foo memorabilia."
5,Finding Pete Jolly again after a number of years.,"First heard Pete Jolly on the album ""Something Festive"". It was a special gift from Firestone I believe. He performed one cut and he made an impression on me. Awesome jazz piano! It's taken me a number of years to get back to him, but I did! I'm very glad I did!"
2,strange necklace,some of the beads are covered with this strange burlap material that is very ugly! The rest of the necklace is pretty..
2,I don't get it,"While the actual music of STATIC X certainly carries a punch, I just don't understand the popularity. it is the same simplistic rendering over and over, without lyrics that border on the ridiculous. They share a common sound with bands like MACHINE HEAD and POWERMAN 5000 (All of which I can't tell apart unless I see a video) which is clunky, fast and dissapointingly simple minded.If you want heavy Industrial/metal, with teeth, try out STRAPPING YOUNG LAD or ULTRASPANK instead."
3,"""great start for a great band""","Not bad, especially for the bands first c.d. Now it isnt their best work, not by a longshot, but it really shows where the band comes from, and has some good songs on it. really the only good, hard rock songs are ""push it"" and ""I'm with stupid"". Many of the other songs are pretty good, but I believe this cd has too much techno and electronics to be their best album. there were many other songs on the cd that would have been much better had they not added the heavy techno influence into them. I'm just glad their next cd ""machine"" was heavier, and that the songs were less cheesy techno rock, and more heavy metal with electronic sound effects in the background."
5,Very good!,"I liked pretty much every song, there are only two slow songs and they are pretty good themselves. This is a must buy for any major Static-x fan."
4,"Nothing new, but...","it's still good stuff no matter how much they sound like other bands. I've experienced the Black Metal category, so *nothing* sounds too horrible any more. (Emperor being the good band, the other 8,000 being the rip-offs.) Bled for Days is an excellent song, so is the opener. For those of you who just can't stand ""copycats"" like these guys, go buy ""City"" by Strapping Young Lad, you'll never hear anything like it again."
2,something is weird here,"Well, I am not one to complain but has anyone noticed the similarity between the first song on this album amd the first song on Astrocreep 2000 by White Zombie? If your ears arent tone deaf like the rest of the nation is you would automatically notice it. The songs sound exactly the damn same! I'm expecting anytime for rob to come out and say ""TUUUUUURRRRRNNNN ME ON YEEEEAAAAAAHHHHH! "" That and the whole album isn't what the doctor ordered either. His voice sounds like Zombie also and the high pitched one sounds the same only it sounds like vocal effects from the studio were used in the camoflauge."
2,"eh, i'm more a slipknot kind of guy...","Like the title says, i'm more into slipknot's innovative style of music with their many musicians in the band. This is too soft for me. And I don't like how they repeate their lyrics a lot. they need to have more variety in their songs. For instance, the beginning of ""Down"" he repeats one word 3 times, then a phrase 3 times, then the main chorus phrase 3 times, then another word 3 times... its all just too simple, not much thought into their songs."
1,BAD!,"This CD is so Bad! Stastic-X is so horrible! They just rip off everything that is out there now! That isn't that bad of a thing, but they just do it so bad. In the song ""so real"" he says only 5 different songs. The songs make no sense, and they just stink! I haven't heard a worse CD than this."
4,Day 1 with the album....,"Saw the video (amazing enough) for ""Push it"" on MTV and said to myself, ""Hmmmm...."" Got the CD and said, ""WOW"".If you could fuse some of the best parts of Ministry and Gravity Kills, you have something close to what Static-X is capable of delivering.Props to these guys, I already love the album!"
5,STATIC,"THIS RULES! IF YOU'RE A STATIC-X FAN BUY IT!!! IF YOU'RE NOT, BUT YOURE REAL RICH AND WANT TO ANNOY THE STATIC-X FANS, DON'T ... BOTHER! THE REMIXES ARE GREAT, THE SONGS RULE, AND WAYNE IS GOD! i just dont get BREAD for days (bled for days)Ozegoration (Otsegolation) sweet of the band (sweat of the bud)wisconsin death trop (trip)...so on, oh well"
1,Borrrriingg!!!,"Wow, Static-X sure is dull!! the songs all sound exactly the same, and the voacls are annoying as hell! I guess you have to actuly like White Zombie to apreciate a band that wants to be them, with and Fear Factory mushed together! these guys should get a clue!"
3,worth maybe about 5-6 listens before forgetting about it!,"this is an okay cd, a little too aggressive for my taste, but if i wanted to lose the will to livee, i would just do it myself, not have someone else do it for me. this cd makes you not want to live. it is very dark (the lyrics mostly) but the reason why i gave it 3 stars was because the music is cool. its a good this that i got this from a friend than paying [money] for it! don't buy unless you like ear splitting screaming and weirdness!"
2,Some Trip,"Sure there's some cool songs on Static X's Wisconsin Death Trip but in all truth I just can't play this album whenever I want. But the fact that there are so many ""Hard Core"" metal bands out there now, it just makes Wisconsin Death Trip a bore and so unoriginal to listen to. It's nothing new to what PANTERA or POWERMAN puts out. If you want an album that just like the rest then get Static X."
1,NO SHUFFLE!!!!! Why even make an MP3 player???,"I got this system home and fired it up and everything sounded great, until...I popped in an MP3 cd that I burned and realized there was not a shuffle button!!! Part of the convenience and fun of MP3's is making your own CD's and creating your own mixes of songs. Who wants to hear a bunch of MP3's in the same order everytime? Oh, okay there's a program funcion on it but I'm not going to sit there and program in 99 songs in random order just to lose the list when I shut it off. I was very disappointed with this particular product. Don't get me wrong, Philips has proven itself as a fine manufacturer (I have a portable CD/MP3 player that works great), but they really dropped the ball on this one."
1,Don't waste your time,"This guy pretends to be THE great investor, but as a seasoned investor and mentor to many more, I was not impressed. He should write about something he knows about like world travel. Even Robert Kiyosaki dumped him after his earlier book and got a different real estate advisor."
3,Very cute but I don't like it.,This toy is cute and the blocks are adorable but I have this at the daycare I work at and I don't like the truck itself because as someone else said the blue dump part falls off. I tossed this toy into the toddler room because I got tired of putting it together. This toy is not the best peekablock toy.
1,A tedious piece of literary flotsam,"Barth has produced a tiresome, unoriginal retread of ""The Arabian Nights"" which was itself the invention of the explorer Richard Burton, rather than a true piece of Oriental literature. In this book, virgins are deflowered by princelings waving scabbards and screaming ""Aiyee!"" This is the literary equivalent of cotton candy; ephemeral and not particularly edifying."
4,from my experience,"i've only played it once, but it was so sweet, i guess the only drawback is that you need a memory pack to save... and his head could be a little less square, but a good game to the end"
1,Worst game of th year,"It is the most boring game I've ever play. If there is a worst game voting poll, this will be my favorite."
2,It Should Have Been More ACtion And LEss Puzzles,I bought this cuz it was the first N64 with a well-known comic hero: Superman. I must say it was not worth getting it for my b-day cuz i the controls were not good and the fun factor was 2.
1,This is SUPERMAN?,"Out of all the games I own, this is by far the WORST. Unfortunately, I didn't read any reviews of the game prior to purchase. Usually, I rent the game before buying it, but I broke my own rule and bought it first. The graphics are so-so at best, and it is so BORING it makes you want to do anything else BUT play it. The last thing you want to do is continually fly through RINGS for no reason. There must be something else they could've done with this. I feel as though I was ripped off. Too bad DC Comics allowed Titus to use the Superman name on this lousy, boring, rip off. They should all be ashamed."
1,LEX WINS,"While no one was looking, Lex won 40 times. He won 40 times. That's as many as four tens. And that's terrible."
1,The worst ... game ever,"I tell you what, this game isn't fit to get for free. One thingthe graffics [are terrible]. .......................... And in the multi player you only can play bad guys. Every other level is the exact same thing except you get less time. Superman can die from a bullet. You can't change into Clark Kent. There is no sheild. No voices that are recobnisable, I may have missed some. And last but not most, you can only beat the game on the hard level. I had gotten all the way up to the 2nd to last level and found out that it had to be on hard diffuculty."
1,I didn't even play this game.,"I didn't even play this game and I don't own an N64, but because there are so many bad reviews I will just give this game another bad review so people won't buy it since it's supposed to be the WORST GAME EVER."
1,Deserves the Turkey award!!!!,"This game was soooo bad, I took it immediately back to the game store where I got it from. I got it since I am a Superhero fan, but trust me, even if you are a diehard fan of Superman, resist the urge to purchase this game or trade for it or even accept it for free!!!!! This is one of those noway games that should be thrown in the microwave and have the molecules in it to be melted for good.When i first turned the game on, the people in the first level looked like an oil painting. And it is nearly impossible to fly through those rings!!! Miss one ring and words show up that say,""Lex wins"" and you hear a really bad reproduction of baldy's laugh.I put two stars for this being a fun game because it is so much fun to laugh at!!! I wonder why DC let Titus make this horrific game!!!! 'sob'"
5,Absolutely breathtaking,"I was turned on to this by a sample listening station in a local music store when this was first released and I've been hooked ever since. I enjoy this CD every evening and every morning and never grow weary of its sounds. This title is not just for fans of New Age. Anyone searching for inspiration, physical or emotional strength, or just the natural ""high"" one receives when immersed with beautiful music would greatly benefit from purchasing this collection. There are several different styles from many diverse artists, seemingly inducing a fresh perspective upon each listening. After seven years, I have yet to uncover its equal. Listen to the samples and experience what true genius is."
1,Brittle!,We had to have this reshipped. The clear plastic is way too brittle. It arrived shattered in numerous pieces.
1,Mirror fogs up,"this mirror isn't worth the price, it fogs up as soon as you get it. save your money and buy somewhere else"
2,Fog free life too short,"Fog free mirrors usually last 3-6 months in my experience. This one made it 1.5 months. Don't know why they all stop working, but I treat them as disposable and just plan to reorder. Won't choose this brand again."
3,Not Very Fogless,"The suction works well enough. It does fall down every few months. However, the mirror is not very fogless. It is actually just a thin sheet of reflective plastic. You can wipe it off easily enough every few minutes with your hand while you shave."
4,Great collecters toy!!!!!!,This was a great toy!!! I gave it 3 for duaballe because its engenies fell apart....umm err yea not because of me though heh heh.It is just great to look at!!!!It had a neat cockpit but it did not shut the full way... Overall it was edgucational becaus of special eye and building with gears functions. Overall it was a gret toy a must have for all Collecters!!
4,Laugh-out-loud funny,"""Question: Dear Mr. Language Person--What is George Bush's native tongue? Answer: He doesn't have one.""From ""Ask Mr. Language Person"" to the ""Exploding Animal Institute"" to Dave's classic announcement of his candidacy for the Presidency of the United States--his platform consists of a dramatic reorganization of the bureaucracy so that domestic affairs will all be handled by the Department of Louise, and foreign affairs by the Department of a Couple of Guys Named Victor (""Y'know, Victors, I wouldn't mind hearing that Fidel Castro had had an unfortunate accident..."")--this collection of Dave Barry's weekly humor columns from the early 1990s still has the power to induce chortles, guffaws, and even the occasional cackle.The audiobook version is well-delivered by Johnny Heller. Just don't listen to it in public unless you don't mind people seeing you grinning idiotically or hearing you laughing like a ninny."
2,"Same old, salme old. Snore.","If Mike Adams would spend less time making it obvious that he loves the sound of his own voice and the look of his own words in print more than he loves actually saying what needs to be said, this would be a better book. I give it 2 stars because it is readable and some parts did make me smile. He's almost funny in an amateurish-comedian sort of way.What Mike is more interested in than ""truth"" is fame and some form of entertainment contract. He vies to be the next ""Limbaugh"" or ""Coulter"", but sadly, lacks the wit, charisma, or the insight to the issues that these others have, or had.Which is why, of course, so few people have heard of or read his virtually ""self-published"" ego book.Mike Adams is not very funny. Even if what he says is true. Mike Adams comes across as a parody of somebody smarter than he is. Too bad, Mike."
2,Doesn't speak to me,"As we dream about and shop for our second home, we have been collecting books on the topic. Unfortunately, we grabbed this one (in hardcover) without spending enough time going through it first. The editors seem to have chosen those homes with no clue about what kinds of homes readers would relate to and what kind of information readers would want. For a much more satisfying mix of dreamy homes and helpful information, our #1 pick is a book called SECOND HOME: FINDING YOUR PLACE IN THE FUN. It lets us dream and relax but also puts us on the ""trail"" of our own getaway place."
5,Deb's watch,This watch is great for the vision-impaired. The numbersare easy to see and the indiglo light makes it easy for night use. I love it since my vision is impaired and Ican see the time.
2,Might be okay if you live in the desert...,"This is my second Bissell Proheat carpet cleaner. My previous model was made more poorly (cheap plastic parts, especially the water tank) and gave up the ghost after about two years of occasional use. I bought a new one expecting comparable performance. This machine has been re-engineered in some positive ways (sturdier water tank, easier to clean the intake area) but it totally lacks the suction necessary to get the water & soap out of the carpet. It seems like a waste of time and energy to scrub the carpet just to leave it soaking wet with dirty, soapy water. Plus, mold can easily grow within in the 2-3 days it takes to dry completely. I've talked to Bissell customer service about the inadequate suction; they told me the gaskets need a while to ""settle in,"" but I've had it for several months and multiple uses now with no improvement. Needs major improvement!!"
3,"carpets yes, hard floors no","I bought this for the versatility to use on carpet and tile floors. I like the job on my carpets. I'm not so impressed with the hard floor aspects. It's a little large to be very maneuverable in a bathroom and doesn't fit between the toilet and wall/tub. It cleans moderately well, but the edges are always missed. Great for carpet, not to much hard floors."
5,Great carpet cleaner,This carpet cleaner cleans as well as any carpet cleaner I have ever rented. I believe it is as good as any professional carpet cleaning I have had too. This machine will pay for itself in a couple of cleanings and is always on hand for those unexpected messes!
1,Worked great before it stopped working,"I've had this machine for about 3 years, used it not even a dozen times and now it does not spray out the water/soap... not sure if it's the water pump, or the jets are clogged or what. Of course, it's all plastic... you can only take so much of it apart to try to see what could be the issue with it. I certainly did not get my $200.00 worth out of it for the relatively few times I've used it. However, when it did work, it resurrected my friend's white carpet she was ready to rip out, that was blackened from kids, pets, muddy shoes and a wood stove."
2,"Good at first, and then it died!",We got this bissel because my mom has an older model and we have been sharing it for a couple of years. It works great. We decided because we had pets and need one more frequently to order our own. It worked great. My husband always cleaned it up after use and let it dry and put it away. One day he tried to use it and no water would come out!! We had only used it probably less than 6 times! We are not very happy. Not sure if we will buy another if we cannot get it to work or just keep using my mom's. I have mixed feelings about it. It is a lot of money to spend to have something quit working after a handful of uses with no real explaination. All I can say is good luck!
5,Excellent Carpet Cleaner,"When we did the research to find out which steamer to buy, we read the great reviews on the Bissell 9400 Proheat 2X. We decided to buy it & were amazed at how well it got rid of 3 years of dirt, soil & food stains on our carpet. We were so ready to change the carpet in our family room, but we saved a bundle with the 9400. It looked brand new after it was steamed. We have a 22 month old, so investing in the 9400 was totally worth it."
4,Stop paying for professional cleaning,Worth the money. I got out stains that the professional cleaner told me specifically would not come out. The only negative is the small amount of water it holds so you are often chaning and adding new water. However for price and performance well worth the hassle.
2,You need a Rug Doctor,"Have used Bissell Pro Heat for many years, 2 machines, many repairs, replacement parts, etc.,2 homes, many pets, ..... lots of experience. It was always OK because the solution that was sucked up (there is always a lot less sucked up than put down)was brown, ugly and dirty. Saw A Rug Doctor at Sam's last week for $399. Much bigger bucks but our rugs just are not as clean (and never have been) as we really want them with the Pro Heat. Took the plunge. WOW....I mean really WOW! Night and day. The stuff the Rug Doctor is pulling out of the rugs is incredible, and it sucks a whole lot of the solution out of the rug leaving very little, just damp. All that time and effort I put into the Pro Heat - BIG MISTAKE. If you need clean rugs, you need a Rug Doctor. (I re-read this and it comes across as if I work for Rug Doctor, but really, I have never been more sincere in my life.)"
4,Very Good Carpet Cleaner,"I would have given it 5 stars except for - there is this little deflector/ L shaped joint that helps the water that is sucked back from the carpet to be poured back into the dirty water container - and it doesnt always sit properly .....so if you are not careful, the water doesnt get sucked back well from the carpet. So you could pour a gallon of water in the clean water tank and when you are done, find out that there is very little, if any, water in the dirty water side!!! All the water is left behind in the carpet. But if you are careful and conscious to make sure it is sitting well, then there is no problem.Other than that, it is a great cleaner for the price. I bought it for $199 from Amazon in June 07. It says its $249 now. Maybe I bought it when it was on sale or somethingMy 2 cents"
2,Left new stains after removing the old,"After starting to slowly run the Bissell Carpet Cleaner up and down the carpet, I instantly noticed large clumps of wet carpet lint mixed with pet hair that the vacuum was leaving behind. When I inspected the underside of the vacuum, I noticed that the carpet scrubbers were kicking up so much lint that the entire underside of the vacuum was covered in it. That was from running the vaccuum over only 12 square feet of carpet! Even though I kept manually removing the lint every time that I changed out the water in the vaccuum, I ran into another problem. The collecting lint was getting saturated with the dirty carpet water, which would then drip back onto the carpet, making it dirty once again. No matter how frequently I cleaned the bottom of the Bissell, the carpets just could not get clean. Unless you own carpets that amazingly don't produce lint, I would not recommend this carpet cleaner."
1,Never Again,This is the second Bissell that I have purchased. The first worked for about 2 years and then would no longer pump water out. WHen I say 2 years this means I only used it about 6 times as I only shampoo my rugs 3 times a year. When it did work I like how it cleaned so I purchased another to replace the first. I now have had this one just over a year and have used it twice. I went to use it again and the same thing as the first. My husband has done everything the trouble shooting has advised and still nothing. I will never buy another bissell product.
1,Works great until the warrantee runs out,"I bought this machine a couple years ago. I was so excited to save enough money and find a sale so I could own a Bissell. A friend of mine had an old one and his worked great. And so did mine for the first few times I used it. But, the pump started to work only intermittedly and just after the warrantee expired, the beater brushes stopped working. Sometimes the hand tool would spray and sometimes it wouldn't. I have a friend who owns a repair shop who looked at it. He said the new models were made using plastic parts and they break easy. He said the motor that ran the beater bars no longer worked. I have been trying to use the cleaner without the beater bars, but with the intermittent pump, it's just frustrating at best. My daughter bought the same machine and hers did the same thing. Save your money and just rent a machine."
5,AOK,All artists have an excellent feel for their ideas expressed in this album. Truly film music at its best.
2,Cheap replacement that doesn't last,"The cord works for a couple of months and then stops working without having to twist , turn, and bend the plug into tight turns to charge. Finally the plug quits working altogether. After buying two cheap replacements, i will go ahead and pay for the real HP plug. Hopefully it will last longer."
4,Some creative recipes,"Overall, this is a pretty good cookbook. The recipes include common vegetarian favorites as well as more creative dishes. We have tried several recipes from this book, and they have all been good. That being said, several of the recipes are very time consuming or involve steps that could be eliminated. For example, a couple of recipes call for various veggies to be sauteed separately, then combined. I'm sure there's a good reason for that, but I just don't have a lot of time to prepare dinner each evening. With some of the recipes, I have cut corners or made substitutions to save time and the results have been good. Also, the book is lacking in photographs or illustrations, so if a process or dish is new to you, the instructions can be a bit confusing. This cookbook is not for the beginning vegetarian cook, but does provide some inspiration for someone more experienced."
2,Daunting but good,"Certainly not appropriate for spur-of-the-moment cooking. Although all the recipies I have tried from this book turned out to be very tasty, I generally tend to rely on other cookbooks since I like to have a great dinner that requires few and simple-to-find ingredients. Greens does not meet these criteria and I am usually very turned off by the length of the ingredient lists and by the particularities in regard to the items required for the recipies. If you have all the time in the world, live in NYC, and don't mind running around town to find everything that is necessary, then this is a great book. If not, fortget about it."
3,Different but not outstanding,"An enjoyable book for mystery lovers, although something kept it from being top notch. Set in Tokyo soon after WWII ended, I think it would have been more interesting to have more background about the city itself during that time.The locked room isn't a large part of the puzzle, and explained away almost nonchalantly by one of the characters (who I found slightly unbelievable). There is quite a lot of background about tattooing, which was interesting and integral to the uncovering of the killer.This was a translation (copyrighted in 1998) and a few phrases seemed to me they couldn't really have been meant that way in the Japanese, or in jargon, of the late 1940's."
5,Very Witty!,"Leonard Nimoy and John de Lancie 'compliment' each other perfectly in their roles as Spock and Q! Or perhaps I should say they joust, insult, mock and generally try to outwit each other!The CD was recorded live so you will hear a bit of audience noise.FYI - I prefer this CD to their version of ""The First Men on the Moon""!"
5,Shakespeare would love this.,"At last, two of the Star Trek universes most beloved characters match wits in this audio tape. We happy few are treated to an intellectual battle the likes of which are rarely known in modern literature. ""Q"" the mischevious superbeing and Spock, the bastion of logic and reason finally ""duke it out"" verbally and the results are wonderful to behold. I highly recommend this hour long exercize in debate and linguistic legerdemain to any and all fans of witty repartee, oh, we Trekkors dig it too."
3,Could use an update,"We were a ittle disappointed with some of their recommendations. The DK and Moon filled in where Lonely Planet left off. Moon provided the historical background and DK the pictorial. With all there is to see and the friendliness of the Brazilians, we forged our own trail and didn't have to rely on guidebooks that much."
4,lonelyplanet brazil,Lonely Planet Brazili go in september to brazil but i started reading already in my book from brazil it's filled with good tips for excursions and other things to.
1,"Atrocious accommodation recommendations, wrong maps, and more","I cannot possibly agree more with an earlier review suggesting that the book's coverage was horrendous - though the problems don't stop there. Maps are not really accurate (hence will cost you much unnecessary walking), recommended pousadas are overcharged student hostels with rooms scantly larger than Japanese 'coffin beds', and 'safety advices' aren't really reliable (be sure to find in the next edition a line like 'with the World Cup and the Olympics coming up soon, however, all these are bound to change as the government is determined to clean up blah blah blah'). Mightily disappointed by an LP for once."
1,expensive toilet paper,"This a terrible book.it provides very little useful (if any) information on improving your play. the chapters on playing it safe and ""worst piece first"" is nothing but a cluster of useless information. Also the chapter on avioding blunders is laughable. Basically it states that before mAKING YOUR move you should look at the board through the eyes of a patzer and if your move is the same as the one the patzer would make then think of another move. So if you already wiped your ass today, you won't have any use for this book. Look elsewhere!"
2,other albums are better,"I liked only 7 songs out of 12 on this one. Tomatito and Jesse Cook could be found on better collections though. Again, tapping, clapping, congos, and the like. For $4.99 it's a good value, but dont pay more."
5,A must-read for TB fans!,"Although this book took a few chapters to get me interested, when I got there, I was hooked! I couldn't put the book down.The decision Samantha had to make between keeping Shining or giving him to Mandy, a disabled girl was so realistic and I had no clue which one I wanted to happen. In the end, like all TB books, everything turned out good. I am becoming a little disappointed that the book wasn't on racing that much. But still, a well done job. I wish that Mandy would become the next made character because I think she is courageous and inspiring. I can't wait to read number 13. Bravo, Joanna Campbell!"
3,Essential for controlling our hot water recirc pump.,"This product is essential to controlling our hot water recirculation pump. It is however, the second unit due to a failure of the first unit."
2,A real stinker,"Oy, what a disappointment. Very poor recording quality of this live performance -- sounds like someone on the front row recorded it with an old cassette tape pocket device. The Judi Dench number (""Sixteen Going On Seventeen"") is a hoot, and there's a pretty colorful number from Oklahoma (""Kansas City""), but they can't compensate for the rest of this very sub-par project. It is anything but ""enchanting""."
5,Perfect Birthday,"Lulu is a charming, colourful character brought to life with vibrant illustrations. The pictures really appeal to my little girl, and she never tires of being read it."
5,An excellent hypnotherapy text!,"This book has to be approached, that is, read, from the standpoint of a hypnotherapist learning to improve his skill set. It is, in a way, a difficult book to read because reading scripts tends to put you into trance. You must consistently read it with an eye toward picking out the phrasing used and the intent of the wording in the scripts. If this is done, the text is quite instructive and complete. The casual readerlooking for party tricks won't find them here. This is a bookfor those with serious interest willing to let its wisdompermeate their subconscious slowly, slowly, deeper and deeper."
5,Top shelf product,"Well done and thorough, by a multitude of the best authors. Such synoptic information would be useful in a variety of other fields, as what is here represents a digest of perhaps 500 papers culled from 2500. Undergrad to masters level coverage. It is also very up to date in the sense of covering recent eruptions, and very down to date in dealing with ancient Japanese and Greek records. Some excellent color photographs as well."
5,Celtic Odyssey is true Celtic Music.,"This was one of the first Celtic CDs I bought, and it continues to prove to be the best of all. There are many CDs out there that say they are Celtic, and/or have ""Celtic"" in their title, but none of them have genuine Celtic quality music that this CD has."
5,Very Satisfied,The book arrived very quickly and in perfect condition just as advertised. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
2,Quedo en el Intento,"Creo que el titulo dice mucho INTIMO, pero no es necesario que sea tan malo, el dvd tiene muy mal sonido o asi tocan hoy :( - Hay que esperar por lo menos un DVD de videos.Recomendado solo como coleccion para Fans. como yo :)"
4,Track list,"The set is a very nice balance of old and new, as well as a few covers.* Masquerade* The Metro* Drug* No More Words* Shiny* Pleasure Victim* Lost My Mind* Stranger on the Bus* The Dope Show (a Marilyn Manson cover)* Blink of an Eye* Take My Breath Away* Sex (I'm a)* With a Touch* Never Let Me Down Again (a Depeche Mode song)"
1,I want my money back,"I was looking forward to read the book since the subject matter is very interesting to me. Sadly, the author (Fredric Alan Maxwell ) sounded way too bitter and way too biased.After reading the book I had these questions: Did the author proof read his book? The author did not even know how to spell Bellevue, WA in his book. Did he just do a search on the Internet and selected what appealed to him? Why is the author very bitter?My suggestion to the author:- Try to present facts and have the reader come up with the conclusion wither Steve Ballmer is a 'Bad Boy' or not!!!- Try to sound a little less bitter. That would sell more books!!!If you just want anti Microsoft material, just read it off the net and don't waste your money on the book!!! I feel I wasted my time and money on this book :-("
4,Great Insight,It was a well done documentary on Steve Jobs including interviews with those close to him. I'm reading his biography now too. The movie did not include personal relationships and family. It is very much focused on his professional accomplishments.
4,Liked it!,"I admire Steve Jobs immensely, so taking bias into consideration, I liked this documentary because it is a narrative of his big accomplishments yet concise, with testimonials of those who were there with him. Yes, there are many images well know, but on the other hand there are those neighbor memories that are new to me."
5,Things I never knew,"Even though this documentary was short it sets the stage for Sony to develop a real sequel to Pirates of Silicone Valley. I was happy of the outcome even the new apple graphic that went viral that came from the mind of a college graphic student on how it was inspired after Jobs passing. It was clever yet sad as Jobs was a true visionary. I only wish he was around long enough to prove to us how he ""cracked the code"" regarding cable TV and DVR boxes. As he said ""TV can't evolve with a box"" something to that regard. I'm glad I signed up for prime in order to watch this."
5,The Legend,I have read the biography written by Isaacson as well and this movie captures the critical highlights of Job's life nicely in 55 minutes!
3,Not Bad...Rushed,"The documentary was fairly straightforward. Nothing of note. The rush to get it out so close to the passing of Steve Jobs is reflected in the quality of the film. One comment: Wikileaker may have had some valid points but unfortunately we need to completely disqualify everything in his/her comment due to argumentum ad hitlerum. Sorry, Wikileaker. You crossed the line into absurdity. You may want to read some history before invoking the atrocities of the Nazis before comparing them to a successful marketer."
2,Expected better from PBS,"I am used to seeing things on PBS that are in-depth, and that do not rush through things to cover all the bases. This documentary was more along the lines of the latter. The sounds effects when transitioning from one ""chapter"" to another were very annoying. I wish they had picked on an aspect of his life and covered it more thoroughly, or produced a longer documentary. It was informative, nonetheless."
2,Ehh..,"If Steve Jobs was really as interesting, creative, and dynamic as they say, you would think the film would have been able to show it more. Instead of gaining any real insights into who Steve Jobs was as a person, or how his life shaped him, I felt like I was just watching a celebratory tribute to Steve Jobs. If you want to watch laudatory snippets praising the creativity and amazingness of Steve Jobs, without any real depth in the film, this is it. I don't think I learned anything here, and to be honest, I feel a little grossed out by how gushy in adulation the film was. I expected better from PBS."
1,Very sensitive!!!,"my 8 year old daughter got this as a gift. within an hour she was holding it and dropped it on the ""carpet"" and it never worked again. they should say in bold letter to be very careful not to bump it or jostle it in any way as it's insides are very sensitive.just thought I'd let people of younger children know to be very careful with it.other than that- yeah it's pretty cool to touch."
3,Gourmet tea sampler,"The Blue Eyes herbal mix has an unexpectedly strong but delightful flavor; the Darjeeling is acceptable if undistinguished; The Yerba Mate and the African Red Bush are only for the brave (sort of a boiled tree bark flavor); and the green teas are, well, green teas ('nuff said)."
2,"Lemon, part 2","Picked up my ""fixed"" unit, it worked only once!!!Can't get the burned CD out! I think theyneed to get the bugs worked out of this unit.It's such a hassle to put it all back into thepackaging....I would purchase with caution."
3,Questionable,"This may sound dumb, but I need to know if it's fiction or non? If it is non then I can't buy into it. It's an interesting concept, but means absolutely nothing if what the story tells is not true."
1,The author has a BIG ego in a BIG book,"I wanted to buy this book as a gift for Christmas, but I declined. So far, it is the only Tai Chi book to say it can boost your sexual performance on the cover. Too bad it does not really tell you how, that's just on the cover to draw you in. There are no real forms, no techniques. It's not a how-to. It's thick and looks nice, but has one big theme: The author is saying how good is his supposed skill. Maybe he can con Westerners into buying this book, but I think most average masters in China can beat the crap out of Bruce Frantzis. I am a novice player in Tai Chi, but even I can see that this book is a thick pile of pulp. If his skill is as good as the quality of this book, I can(and should) beat him up for spoiling the reputation of Tai Chi. There are better books out there, go buy them."
1,DEFECTIVE DVD,"When on videotape, this probably was great! The content and videography and sound are fantastic! Unfortunately, my DVD repeatedly froze up and I returned the product. I was sent another and it also would freeze. I suspect when it was transferred from videotape to DVD an overly aggressive anti-copying scheme was employed which makes this product unusable. I have tried it on different DVD players, as well as computers, and it simply freezes up! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT UNTIL THE DEFECTS HAVE BEEN CLEARED UP. (I'm referring to the ""For Women"" version. The ""For Men"" version is fine.)"
2,Mini but not functional,"Nice looking, mini-me version of salt and pepper mills. Too bad my fingers aren't shrunk to fit. Uncomfortable to use. Gripping the mills at their ""waist"" leaves little room to grip the top and turn. The mechanism requires some force to work, and the mill's size allow you to use only fingertips. The pepper mill is difficult. The salt mill is impossible. Large flakes are no match for the nylon gears. I was tempted to break out the robo-grips to get some seasoning. I'll keep looking for the perfect small mill to put in my desk's cafeteria-helper basket."
3,oh yeah.,"i'll be the first to admit that i don't know jack about reggae music, but i picked up lady saw's latest release in hopes of understanding and, thereby, appreciating reggae more. having mad respect for lady saw for breaking down the sexist, patriarchal walls of reggae music, and for producing her own albums (as well as penning most of the tracks), i listened to _99 ways_ intently. while i'm still not a huge fan of reggae, there are some tracks on this disc that even i like. ""ride of your life"", ""99 ways"", ""brown eyes blue"" and ""let's stay together"" had just enough flavor, without being overwhelming. lady saw is an icon of reggae and _99 ways_ does a good job of demonstrating her talent."
3,Very nice but not perfect without repair,"The controller I received game in what looked to be very good condition. The only issue was the dpad which got stuck while testing. I heard that this was a semi-common problem for n64 controllers but when I owned the system during it's prime, non of my controllers had that issue. I disassembled the controller, claned and fixed the dpad, which works great now. During further testing, all the buttons responded well and precise. The joystick was just right where it never stuck and returned to the middle without further calibration. Shoulder and z buttons responded well too. Cord was in great shape except for the normal wear and tear. Controller was colored on by previous owner in a permanent marker. Will attempt to remove it using alcohol pads. Delivery was fast and packing was well thought of."
1,Broken controller,"I bought this from one of amazon's sellers. It said the condition was ""Used - Very Good."" When I recieved the controller, immediately after taking it out of the box, I noticed the joystick was broken, the controller was covered in dirt, and the L button was cracked. I payed $30 for this! I expect better quality than what I recieved!"
4,Fits my son,"These were purchased to keep my son protected. They fit him well and he uses the strap in the back. They look good also. The only problem I see is they seem to get a bit of fog on the inside. I don't know if that could be prevented. Hey, racquetball is a sweaty sport! Overall, my 13 year old doesn't complain about wearing them."
5,Detailed read on a battle often overlooked.,"This is the second book by Ernest Ferguson that I have had the opportunity to read and I was just as equally impressed as the first read. He doesn't ramble with needless facts but is still very detailed in the events leading up to and also after the one day Battle of Cold Harbor. He has a unique ability of intertwining the big picture of the campaign and battle, but also the soldier on the front line. I recommend 100%!!!"
4,Brilliant!,"Takes a few listens, but then you cant stop. Addicitive! And these guys are so passionate live, great live sound!! Buy this!!"
3,Not a happy ending,"Cruising through cyberspace with Dave Barry is quick, fun, and funny, that is until the chapter on MsPtato & RayAdverb. It's beyond me why Barry departs from humor to end the book on a potentially depressing note. The bulk of the book, however, is enjoyable and while it may not offer information to really get your PC up and running, it gives plenty of opportunity to laugh at the crisis that every PC novice has endured. If the book were a chess match, I would say it had a strong opening and middle game, but a poor finish."
3,Case review,"I originally ordered 4 cases. One for a strat and three for teles. Only one case arrived with the original delivery. I ended up canceling the rest of the order, because, although the tele fit, it looks as if the case was made for a strat and not a tele. This is the way the interior of the case is cut. I would not advise purchasing this case for a tele. Also, I think the badge on the case is too large. Unless you want to help advertise SKB wherever you take it, I would not advise purchasing this case. The case seems to protect the instrument, but I cannot confirm this as I have not had it in service long enough to say."
2,"Pythons can't dance, especially Terry Jones!","In one second season ep Terry Jones (what a common last name!) does a totally lousy, unfunny job doing a strip tease job. He can't talk well either. He really isn't that talented a performer in these senses."
1,BAIT AND SWITCH,"Seriously, HP?Same exact product number...Same exact stats...New packaging...Completely different,grossly inferior paper.If you're going to source something cheaper,at least have the decency to give it a new name and product number.You had the BEST presentation paper.Now you don't.Ugh."
5,Ranulph Fiennes's lifetime of adventures is documented,"Sir Randolph Fiennes has been called the 'world's greatest living explorer': he's spent thirty years circumnavigating the globe, broken many exploration records, and has had both high and low moments in the process, so it's little surprise BEYOND THE LIMITS provides such a fascinating memoir and examination of these points. Ranulph Fiennes's lifetime of adventures is documented in a vivid series of lessons: add color photos and you have an outstanding achievement."
5,Excellent Cat Who book!,"I have read all of Braun's Cat Who books, and this one is a great example of the books where she's really hit her stride. Koko and YumYum are throwing hints all over the place, and Qwilleran makes a new friend--Joe ""Wetherby Goode"" Bunker, who's a terrific character. Qwilleran goes around the North country gathering spooky tales, and these little stories just add to the enjoyment of the book.None of the Cat Who mysteries are that profound. I wasn't shocked at the solution to the mystery. But for pure enjoyable reading, I recommend this Cat Who book very highly."
5,Let the reason be love,"the insight into merrill life was,joyful sad and funny.the tears fell when i read that he was suffering from feelings of loneliness,and his illness he was suffering from.But he made me laugh when he mentioned something that happened between him and wayne. you really must read it to find out what happened.you will get a good insight into what a wonderful person he really is.I don't say this just because i am a freind of his but because it,s a truly wonderful book."
4,"Ultimate Avengers 2 , not quite Ultimate","Well ultimate Avengers 2 is not quite ultimate, well the hulk only has a cameo appearance in the last 5 minutes , & thor saves the day after doing very little in the main body of the story,Giantman dies wich I think is wrong. But if you like ironman & captain america & black panther you will be happy with their contribution to this story. Looking forward to the ironman cartoon/animation movie."
4,Entertaining Avengers,"Tis is a very nice adaption of the Ultimate Avengers comic books. The storyline is similar to the comics and you get a pretty good feel of the tension between the characters. Though some of this has been toned down and there is much more action than drama, which is natural in a movie as apposed to a comic-book that evolves slowly over several years.Fun to watch, and a good sequel toUltimate Avengers - The Movievolume 1All in all, worth the small price-tag."
5,Ultimate Avengers 2,"I am a big comic book fan! When I was younger I used to collect comic books. I would read The Avengers, Spider-man and The X-men. I am very happy that many comicbooks have been made into movies. The Ultimate Avengers 2 dvd is great! The Ultimate Avengers 2 has lots of action and a good story line. If/Until an Avengers movie is made/released in the movie theaters the Ultimate Avengers 2 story on dvd will have to keep us comicbook fans happy. I highly reccommend Ultimate Avengers 2 on dvd!"
4,"Good, but not as good as Ultimate Avengers 1",Must watch Ultimate Avengers part 1 before even attempting to watch part 2 as the stories are highly linked. Overall I found the storyline a touch better in part 1 as the highly advanced natives was a little far fetched in part 2. Overall the quality and voices were excellent in both releases. Great for my 4 yr old daughter as she watches with focus.
3,Second Best to the First One,"I liked this movie alot, but failed in comparissong wen you see the Avengers 1. Not exactly wat i was expecting...but still a good movie."
3,Ultimate Avengers 2,"Not as good as the first movie, stays less true to the source material, but entertaining. Black Panther is the star and the Avengers are just along for the ride. All in all, enjoyable."
3,More Manner That Matter,"This book asks a question that has interested me for a long time -- what makes some buildings beautiful? Unfortunately, the author does not provide much in the way of answers. He does discuss some interesting ideas, notably the fact that ideas of beauty in architecture change over time. But he passes over this to go on to more timeless issues -- balance, elegance, etc. It all sounds very nice -- Mr. De Botton's prose in unfailingly elegant, sometimes irritatingly so. It just doesn't add up to much."
4,The Architecture of Happiness,"De Botton is primarily an essayist. His writing is clear and mature while, his musings on our feelings about architecture are charming. I would recommend the book if you have any interest in architecture at all."
3,70% inspiring and 30% frustrating,"Great book if you were just starting school or needed a reminder of why we do what we do. It's all very simplistic and you can tell it's not written by an architect. This sometimes leads to him using obvious references and losing himself when building an argument. Early on he has trouble defining the importance of architecture and goes in circles to what essentially amounts to an argument against architecture. It is a great book if you are not an architect, but having read much deeper texts in school his arguments fail to go beyond a broad view of our field. As a result, I would say it's a very quick read that is 70% inspiring and 30% frustrating. I work at Margulies Perruzzi Architects. www.mp-architects.com"
5,I like it,"Of the three Neurotic Xmas releases, I suspect that this is my favorite. It has a warm feel with all of the songs definitely having their own personality. I really liked song number 8 (rock the herald angels) until someone in my office said it sounded a little ""tesh-y""! Omigod it does! But I still like it! It would be nice if the Neurotic folks could put together a volume 4. Certainly if you like Christmas music, you'll enjoy this. If you are in the mood for something a little more spiritually inclined for your Christmas listening, then this is the CD for you (along with the other two). The GRP collections are wonderful too."
1,Remo is not a cartoon,This book is infected with the disease that has attacked the series ever since the original authors stopped doing them years ago. Rather than sharply drawn satire we are treated to more caricatures and humor that is dumbed down to the Tom and Jerry level. Avoid this junk at all costs.
1,Regurgitated newspaper articles,"I read this book when it first came out and I was amazed at how little independent research was done. The author read the newspapers, took them at face value and wrote a book. Two years after the murder, we know that the media had been fed misinformation by police sources and ran with it. We have seen a two year run of smears against the family and still no answers.This book was someone's idea of a fast buck, pitiful."
2,What's the use,I am not a phan of this cd. It seems a little drawn out and the jams really never go any where.
3,Early veiwing problems,"In the first hour or so there is a slight problem with the dvd,however it does not impact on the total veiwing and conclusion of the dvd.Also the dvd arrived earlier than expected.thanks."
1,love &other drugs,"This disk was bad and I requested info as to how to make it right, but never received any response. I am very disappointed with your service and will not purchase any thing from you again until this is resolved."
5,Love in Odd places,"I just rented this movie and was actually shocked that I liked it. It's such a relief to see movies that mirror real-life personal struggles that many Americans go through in regards to the medical condition that Anne was suffering from. This really hit close to home b/c a family member of mine was just diagnosed with this disease. This movie was full of romance, laughter, tears, SEX, and learning the true value of life and how to love yourself and another one truly. Jake was a self-centered individual who thrive of bedding women and looking out for himself, meanwhile Anne was going through life by pretending not to have a care to compensate for the fact that she believed no one should be able to love her and her disease truly. I loved this movie, I won't spoil it for anyone else. I will get this on dvd."
5,Right on the money,"Anne Hathaway was simply phenomenal! I have a degenerative disease, and I thought that her ability to pin point all of the emotions that rule you in this occurrence was absolutely phenomenal. Definitely a must see."
1,do not watch if you like ann,"Terrible acting, dialogues, pointless sex scenes.Before this movie I really liked Ann but everyone can make a bad movie once in a while.This is more the director's and writer's fault. I hope."
3,Honestly Don't know about the nudity,"I am not saying I hated this film or it is a cheap erotic film.The acting, the story,.. everything seems decent.But Two actors' nudity seems too much sometimes.I don't know why that was necesarry.Anne Hathaway is a surprising actress in so many ways.In her level, she is popular and amazing enough to avoid nudity in her movies for success.Maybe, I thought, before becoming too old, she wanted to leave her beautiful moment through her movie-even though the story is not an erotic film (Clearly it's a serious story).That's my honest thought about this movie.Both actors are brave enough to show their whole body nudity.The story is not perfect and sometimes I felt like I am lost what they are trying to say.The image seems perfect. It is HD image all right.It is not an action movie or SF, so no need to talk aboout the sound."
4,Intriguing Drama...,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.This film is pretty good. Jake Gyllanhaal plays a salesman who's forced into pharmaceutical sales after he gets a little too cozy with the boss' wife, and Anne Hathaway (""The Princess Diaries,"" ""The Princess Diaries 2"") plays a young woman who has Parkinson's Disease. The film is good in depicting people with the disease and exposing the utter callousness of others. I recommend this movie."
3,Querious,"After seeing Ms. Hathaway in all the other movies... I wanted to see her in a different role... She has a great body, but the movie was about average at best. Nothing against her..."
2,Average with a side of promise,2 1/290's debut from the Swedish prog-rockers is a lukewarm mixture of pleasant homage and limp-ish dynamics.
5,DJ Spinna Shines,"Spinna's melodically chimed music juxtaposed with tight beats creates a laid back, unpolished album. Polyrhythm has the best lady-rapper I ever heard in my life and she outshines her two male counterparts. As a bassist my jaw dropped from the lightning fast plucking on Motion 2000. I must say, their are few good hooks in the songs besides the music itself, which I'm not saying is bad, it's just a heads up; don't expect pop-rap. While the album's 30 minute length is the only downfall it's well worth the purchase because good rap is hard to find."
1,piece of junk,This item is a piece of junk...1sr day we used it it got a hairline spilt up the side of body in which air could escape so pressurizing did not work...had item replaced and new mister came with a crack in the same exact spot while still packaged!! Sent it back asap
4,Way Cheaper at Target,"Was looking for a misting but picked up one of these to try. Only I got mine out of the dollar bin at Target! Exact same mister. It is a little bit drippy, but it does the job. Button is hard for smaller children to press."
2,Mediocre at best. A lost cause at the worst.,I hate to say this but I found nothing of value in this book. I would not recommend it as a book to learn HTML 4. There is very little on HTML 4 in this book. As others have said I recommend getting Castro's Visual Quick Start instead. The book is simply better and its small and doesn't cost a lot.
3,Quality Vacuum but too small of a disposable bag,"Don't expect to use this vacuum for ALL your cleaning needs. Its excellent quality , with nice features and GREAT suction, however the disposable bag is much too small. I vacuumed 2 wool rugs that are a year old and previously vacuumed many times with my old Oreck and filled the bag the first time I used it. Folds up to a small foot print and the wire recoil is a nice feature but its demise is the small bag unless you don't mind purchasing bags frequently"
4,Good Power Electrolux,The electrolux has good power and is easy to operate and store. I do wish it had a longer cord.
4,Electrolux Intensity,"We went out shopping for a new canister vacuum when my other one broke and stumbled up on this on clearance at BrandsMart for $88. It has awesome suction, cool design, and even gets around my baseboards since there is no hose. only drawback are the small bags. I have 2 dogs that shed and get pine straw and stuff stuck to their hair so I vacuum every couple days and I seem to be changing the bag after like 2-3 uses. We did go ahead and buy a few when we purchased but I am going to look into buying a large amount at once to save money. It is very lightweight and takes up very little space. We have hard woods, rugs, and carpet and it works well for all three. My living room rug has never looked so clean. I see why people pay the money for this brand."
5,excellent vacuum,small bag short cord excellent vacuum having a problem pushing vacuum take hub caps off wheels and loosen screws 1/8 of a turn wheels will roll easier. Would buy again!!!
1,Dead on arrival,"Vacuum arrived unable to power-on. Called Electrolux customer service and although they were very nice, they came to the conclusion that I got a dud. Clearly Electrolux has some quality control problems. Very disappointing because at the current price, this vacuum seems like a great bargain. Oh well."
1,This vacuum did not perform as expected,"I should have googled wheel in conjunction with this model. One of the wheels fell off after about ten uses! Good suction, but roller clogs up with pet hair and you have to manually pull it out. Small bag. Short cord. Do not recommend. I could have dealt with some of the dysfunction until the wheel fell off. Not the Electrolux I anticipated."
3,off button problem but service good,"in general I found this product live up to my expectation given its price. It's not super quiet but tolerable, much better than the up-right vacuums worth $30-60 I've used before. Navigation with this product is a bit difficult on wooden floors, because the machine is heavy and the wheels feel a bit stuck.I returned the product mainly because the off button is not reliable. I opened the box and the second time I tried it, the off button won't work and I have to unplug the machine. I encountered the same problem again the next day and decided to return it. But the seller is very good at dealing with the return. Essentially I called Electrolux to get an incidence number and then give the number to CPO and they processed the return immediately. Then I just print out the return label and drop it off at a FedEX."
2,"Great suction, but heavy & awkward","We ended up returning this vacuum as it definitely has great suction, but the trade off is the small bag (it's bag is smaller than my hand held vacuum!). Plus, it was difficult to turn and get into small areas. Can't beat the price, so if you had a large area that didn't need much navigating and you were only vacuuming occasionally, it may be just what you need. Otherwise, it may be worth the few extra bucks to get something more user friendly."
2,Christmas Eve,"This reproduction was made out of the USA and the quality of the picture and colow were less than desirable. When I ordered this product I felt it would be of top quality , but it wasn't."
3,Good but hard to follow,"This book was interesting and I was very enlightened. I realized that I do have a binge eating disorder and all of the advice in the book was great. However, I found that it was hard to follow and to keep on top of. Very easy to revert back to prior binge eating ways. There is still hope:My recommendation is The Hunger Within: A Twelve-Week Self-Guided Journey from Compulsive Eating to Recovery -- by Marilyn Migliore, Philip Ross See my review of this book..."
1,Not rceived yet,I didn't received my orders yet after more tahn one month...Is it normal?Could anybody help me with that?Thanks a lot.E. P.
5,One of the best cop shows ever.,"One of the best cop show which centered on the people involved and NOT special effects. There is much dialogue and character development in each episode. You get to see the effect that various crimes have on the police, victim and even the perpetrator."
5,America - A Tribute to Heroes,"This is an excellent CD. Not only the musicians + the songs are great, but it creates an atmosphere that gives you goosebumps when listening. Absolutely beautiful!"
3,Celine Dion got short-changed on this cd,"I bought the cd because of a few great vocalists, Celine Dion being one of them. I think they did this on purpose to her. Her name is in smaller fonts than all the other artists, on the listing on the back of the cd. Don't believe me? Check it out for yourself. Her name is at least 1 font size smaller. Also I couldn't help but notice the bad sound engineering of her song. Whenever she hits high notes, it sounds static and there's disturbances in the reproduction, as if her voice range is too large for the technology. I don't know what's going on here, but someone is hating Celine."
5,True American Icon Tops it Off,"I still get goose bumps when I listen to the opening track of this cd. When Springsteen shows his face, the country listens, and nothing should prove this more than ""City of Ruin."" I think overall this is a great cd, but that song is so powerful that it will chill anyone who hears it, and make those who support terrorism shiver at the quiet, intense anger that only Springsteen can express so eloquently."
2,For good reasons...,"Bon Jovi was surprising, but not as much as Limp Bizkit. With all do respect,Willie Nelson's guitar solo was quite amusing in the middle of that patriot feeling that might have been in studio."
5,e-RPG by Brad Stone....great book!,"This is a great jumping-off point into writing web applications and cgi programs using RPG. Brad's book is well-written and easily understood...and uses the language and terminology we're all familiar with. Great job, Brad.Looking forward to the next one!"
1,Did the author write all these positive reviews?,I had great hope for what what I could learn from this book. But it's mostly on and on about little useful how to stuff. At COMMON recently I strolled past the (new publisher cause they said the original went Bankrupt) publisher's booth and they were joking about writing online reviews and testimonials! They must not have known I was there. I looked over his new book hoping it would address the important stuff but it's wasn't much better and it's too expensive to make this mistake again.If it's the boss's money what the heck. If it's your money then keep looking!
1,Ouch!!,They should have called this CD Aroma because boy does it stink. Someone please slap them and take away their Barry Manilow albums before I puke !!!!
2,This hurts.....,"As a long time fan from the beginning this album is a sad dissapointment. In a word rather boring other than 1 or 2 songs there is nothing here to catch the ear. John Payne is a great singer and Geoff Downes is brilliant but I believe they are missing the influence of a strong guitar player in the group to drive songs. The songs here are played well enough but I prefer an Asia album with some ""bite"" for lack of a better term and this is not it. Aria and Arena both were much more entertaining. Looking forward to the next album hopefully it won't take as long."
3,Say NO to Digipak!,"Unfortunately, this CD is packaged in a Digipak. Some people think that Digipak is a good and beautiful thing to pack your CD, in fact, it's a very bad and dull way to do that. In a few time, despite of if you are careful owner, the Digpak will looks like a old LP: flaid, scratched and torn. I wish that the Digpack will be banished in a near future. I really hate it! By the way... Asia's music is very good... as always!"
2,Asia Minor,"Okay, you have 25% of the group that released the excellent ""Asia"" album in 1982. But this record is not quite 25% as good as that album. Geoff Downes is a great musician and has written some great songs, and this disc has a couple of solid tunes (such as ""Free""). There are more misses than hits by my ears, however. I was about to say that this band might consider a new name other than ASIA, but upon reading the credits, I'm not sure who is actually in the band. There are more musicians on this thing than in Asia (the Continent, that is!) Steve Howe stopped by to add a few notes onto a couple of the songs, but you don't feel his presence as in the original band.This one is for Asia completists only."
3,AORA,"Sadly I have to disagree with the idea that this album is a step forward. At first I was wowed by it - it's so immediately likeable. And there's the rub. ARENA wasn't - and is now one of my favourite albums ever. With AURA Asia have turned their backs on the sophistication and daring of their previous release; they have gone back to favouring AOR power ballads over original song structures. Very listenable, top quality for what it is, no question... but it just doesn't engage the mind as much. I wish I could be more generous as I did love the sound of it at first - it's wonderufully lush. But I can't help feeling they've lost their nerve. There are no songs to compare with the likes of 'U Bring Me Down' and 'Two Sides of the Moon', or the title track of ARENA. Safer ground, maybe... but not half so exciting."
2,This Hurts....,"As a long time fan from the beginning this album is a sad dissapointment. In a word rather boring other than 1 or 2 songs there is nothing here to catch the ear. John Payne is a great singer and Geoff Downes is brilliant but I believe they are missing the influence of a strong guitar player in the group to drive songs. The songs here are played well enough but I prefer an Asia album with some ""bite"" for lack of a better term and this is not it. Aria and Arena both were much more entertaining. Looking forward to the next album hopefully it won't take as long."
4,Better than other computer poker games,"I bought this game specifically to sharpen my skills in Texas Hold 'em. I thought this game was much more challenging than the highly touted Hoyle Casino 2003. I disagree that the AI players don't bluff ( unless you think a pair of deuces is a good hand!). I haven't experience any of the crashes that the other reviewers reported and it does work on windows XP. I do,however, agree that the graphics are nerdy and I could do without the story line ( flying to Las Vegas, getting into a cab etc.). It is an older game and maybe Masque should sell it at a cheaper price. Otherwise, it is a pretty decent game to sharpen my poker skills."
4,Packaging is incorrect,"I too received the older version, that said Windows 3.1/Windows 95 on the front. I contacted Masque Publishing about this and was told that that IS the most current version, and it runs just fine on Windows XP. I guess they just didn't want to reprint all those CD case inserts?At any rate, it installed and ran fine for me on XP Professional, so don't let concerns about compatibility deter you from buying this product."
1,Lame...,"I bought it just for Aria, she has 1 of 7 segments and she's looked much better elsewhere. All the girls look directly at the camera 100% of the time (some guys like that but it freaks me out)Aria looks very very nervous in her routine. She moves too fast from one pose to another and back to the one she just did. Looks pretty coked up, actually. Bad lighting makes her skin look pasty, 5 o'clock shadow in her pits and crotch and it looks like she did her own makeup. She really looks no better than a $500 call girl. Yes, I do expect perfection. She is Aria after all."
3,pricey?,Seven bucks for a 24 pack seems a little pricey. At the store near here they're ten cents a pack. $7 for 24 must be like a quarter or so a pack if my math is right. Are these not the regular size packs or something?
5,True-sound headphone for recording purposes,"I have had this headphone for more than 5 years, and have not had any problem with it. I use it primarily while sitting at my Yamaha keyboard, as well as for auditing my recordings. The sounds are natural and accurate. The swivel ear cups make it easy to put on and take off. If you don't mind headphone with big ear cups, and don't want to spend a fortune, this is it."
4,Good for editing,"I got these as a gift. They are comfortable, sound very good, keep outside noise out."
5,headphones,Found Audio Technica ATHM40FS headphones to have very good sound range and comfortable to wear. very competitively priced. strong recommendation.
2,headphone,"weight is uncomfortable, sound quality only fair, not sharp and crisp as it should be for phones at this price"
2,No thanks,"I have heard decent headphone before, and these are not even decent. I don't understand, it seems like the headphones are not being driven enough no matter what the source is, the volume is low, the bass is non existent and the clarity is so-so . Perhaps I am not amplifying them enough, but I seriously expected more out of these."
4,An Otherwise Perfect Headphone,"I wanted so much to give this a 5 - the sound quality is superb, the price is right and the frequency response range is awesom - yet I just cannot believe Audio-Technica would be this skimpy on the cushion material around the cups on such a nice pair of phones. It is really a shame to see a pair of cans that deliver such good audio quality have so thin a ring of foam that the inner fabric that covers the speakers touches your ear and make it very uncomfortable, the cushion cover rings themselves are also too small, so they are not really around your ears as it should be, but instead pressing on your ears all the time - it's uncomfortable and your ears will sweat. It's a shame, it would have been a five star phone. Sound is rich, clear, accurate to the source, sound scape is great, I am hearing nuance that was never heard before - an otherwise perfect headphone for budget audiophilers."
4,Good buy. Great price.,"I bought these as a birthday gift for my boyfriend who's a music geek and does home recording and demo-ing. I did a ton of research before I made my final decision on these. When he opened the gift, he immediately thought I spent too much money which is a great feeling because I didn't thanks to amazon. But he loves them and says they sound great. He even takes them into the studio with him so I know he's not just saying it! Good buy. Great price."
4,Good product,"Pro:-Comfortable-Keep out a lot of sound-Good quality materialsCon:-Need adapter to connect to computer-Slides off head if looking down or moving around muchOverall:-I have hi hopes of these headphones sticking around with me for a long time. $60 buys you a lot, LOT better product than some of the panasonic and sony etc.-My brother purchased some BOSE headphones for $120, and they had horrible materials and broke easily - these would rank a whole lot better...quality materials are important!"
2,Audio Technica ATHM40FS Studio Heafphones,"I've ordered these headphones and was not too pleased. For the price I believe they are were well worth it, but I do a lot of recordings in my studio, and the headphones don't meet the criteria."
4,"It's Not a Bose, but...",For the price I love it. The quality is very good. It's not a BOSE. Price verses bang --- very good! Bang-bang!
3,"Sound fine, but hurt my ears (not volume) after an hour","These sound fine, I'm no audiophile, so read others' reviews for sound info.I like to work with headphones on, even when I am not playing music. Just having them on helps me focus. Unfortunately, these headphones do not have deep enough cups to prevent my ears from hurting after an hour or so. The headphones put a lot of pressure on my ear instead of putting the pressure on the side of my head. I guess my ears may stick out a tad more than the average person, so you may not have the same issue.My old cheap headphones do not have this issue because they're 50% deeper in the ears. I really wish I had bought something else."
2,Low quality compared to other headphones,"These headphones have decent sound quality, but far from the best. My friend recently ordered the Sony MDR-ZX600/BLK headphones for $60. We compared headphones, making me realize how disappointing these ATHM40FS are. They are heavy and bulky, making it rather uncomfortable and unstylish. The cord is incredibly inconvenient, being over 15 ft long. My friend's Sony headphones have a far better sound quality. The Sony's bass performance is especially better. The Sony headphones are also sleeker and lighter.I would not recommend these Audio-Technica headphones at all."
3,Not for Music Lovers,"I found the sound quality of these headphones to be noticeably inferior to a pair of SONY headphones that were only slightly more expensive. The SONY's had great sound, but the pads fell off after 40 days and the company wouldn't replace them because the guarantee only lasts for 30. They were downright rude to me when I tried to get them to stand by their products, and wouldn't hear of it. I gave them to a friend who super glued them back on. Too late I checked the reviews of the SONY's and many reviewers cited the very same issues. Avoid SONY like the plague for headphones.Finally, I ponied up for the Audio-Technica ATH 50 model--and THEY are the ones to buy! Fantastic earphones, with all the sound quality and volume power one could dream of. This time, you get what you pay for."
5,Inspiring look at experiential education,"This book and its many beautiful photos encompasses the passion and philosophies of a great organization. Mark's ability to capture the essence of what it means ""to serve, to strive and not to yield"" really shines through in this book. I look forward to future books and photos by Mark Zelinski."
1,Outdated format,"This book was published in 1995. Today, a decade later, it is unclear why the book should be published today in hardcover form. Something like this is far better suited in CD format, or, even better, as a website. The latter could then have links to the websites of the organisations it listed. Obviously. Plus, as a website, it could have far richer keyword searching than in book form.Some types of reference material, like this, are really no longer optimal as books. Beside, $2380 for the book?! Totally overvalued."
2,Strictly For Beginners,"I might recommend this book to somebody studying to be in the visual effects business. It has some of the basic information for beginners but even there it falls short on what you would need to know.I did enjoy the interviews with Bill Taylor, who I would consider a master of the art form, but this book only scratches the surface.The price is also very high for what you get, which in my opinion is not very much."
4,Great CD!,"This is a great CD from a newcomer. Most of this album contains songs that were recorded by other artists such as Chalee Tennison, and Jamie O'Neeal. This still is an album people should check out that like country music."
4,GOOD Smelling product,I liked the combination of fragrances used to arrive at the distinctive smell of this spray cologne. I wear it very well and get many compliments and questions about what the fragrance is that I'm wearing.
2,A must have for the bad movie collecter,"Film was so awful I laughed in the wrong places. Two runaway girls, one possessed with psychic powers, are lured into a witches coven by a lesbian modeling agent. A photographer tries hanky panky with one, but the modeling agent sees them and calls out to him. ""I'm coming!"" he tells her. Another silly moment is during the sacrifice ritual when the girl uses her psychic powers to stab the evil modeling agent to death by driving a knife into the ground. A MUST HAVE for cultists who liked Plan Nine From Outer Space or Not of This Earth."
5,Great book!,I could relate to the main character even though she was much younger than I am. She was searching for the ultimate forgiveness and peace. An excellent read!
5,How lovely,Brandon is brilliant. He articulates emotion in words and music like no other boy with a guitar. There's a bit of everything on this album and I cannot stop playing it over and over again. Yeah!
5,Great Story,Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse is a story about a youth and his quest for enlightenment. He tries to find it fasting and living without possessions and becoming a Buddha's follower. When this does not work he slips into a life of hedonism and materialism. When all else fails he becomes a ferryman's apprentice and learns lessons that cannot be taught but learned only by living experiences.
5,English,"I haven't actually read this one all the way through, but I'll give Hesse the benefit of the doubt and say this is worth reading.More importantly, the formatting is legible and clean. It's safe to download.Also, it is in English, not German... too bad."
1,"Excellent Story, Abhorrent Translation","I have no doubt that Hermann Hesse would find this translation of his masterpiece insulting. The book is replete with grammatical errors, spelling errors, incorrect words, syntax errors, and various other anomalies that expose the amateurishness of the translator, remiss of the editor, and failure of the publisher. Read reviews and find a different version, but read the story nonetheless."
1,"great book, bad kindle adaptation","The book is great, but this kindle version is very poor: bad lines breaks, no table of content, not even a cover image. Disappointing."
1,Kindle users: Be sure to download a preview,"There are multiple versions of this listed. The version I'm reviewing against has built-in line breaks all throughout, which causes the book to be broken strangely when reading on the Kindle or iPhone. Unless you use the absolute smallest font (and landscape orientation on the iPhone), you will have full lines alternating with lines of 1-2 words.If buying on Kindle - be sure to get a free preview first, to be sure you're not getting the badly paginated version!"
1,Dissapointing Translation,The German to English translation for this work is disappointing. Word order is often confused and confusing to the english reader. I will have to find and purchase a copy of the ~1968 translation I originally read.
1,Cheaper for a reason,formating is lacking and the trasnslation seems off. spend a little more and get a good edition.
2,Other reviews are misleading!,"Ok, so I ordered this book in an attempt to make my first CAD class easier. What is mentioned nowhere in the other reviews, or anywhere for that matter, is that this book focuses on using autocad for designing floorplans and edifices in general. I am studying mechanical engineering and found a lot of this information useless. The book didn't even cover centerlines, an extremely basic topic. Sure, many of the topics covered are applicable to other uses of autocad, but I would much rather have had the book just show general examples of the functions of Autocad rather than focus on specific floorplans and the design of buildings."
5,If you love Toby Keith (and whats not to love?) gotta have,"Unleashed is good, but this is one of Toby's best! A great combination of all the songs that exude the Country style known only to Toby Keith fans! Gotta have this in your collection- highly recommend"
5,reachforthestars,"5 stars whats left to say! A true talent on top of the game. How do you like me now, and pull this one coming soon with a hit already on the radio! I think he has'nt peaked yet! Scarey Huh?"
4,WOW,"I was cleaning house one day,and I had the country video channel on,and I heard ""how do you like me now""....WOW,I was so impressed! In situations like that I dunno if I would have handled myself as well. Letting someone ""know"" you cared in such a fun,kind hearted way,was a step above the rest! Then I got luckier and had a long road trip to take and I got to hear ALOT more of his songs. I was hooked. I like his style and thoughtfullness he uses to ""handle"" things in everyday life,plus he adds a SMILE when he does it. He can be my cowboy any time."
3,Cute and cheap,"I bought these as they looked cute and the price couldn't be beat. I will most likely buy again BUT, the price isn't the only thing that is cheap about these. After the first wash, one of them starting spliting at the side seam. They don't 'ride' up too bad either."
1,not as pictured or described!,"I actually received two pair of black, two pair of dark purple and two pair of teal - no white at all, no patterns. if color doesn't matter and you like a ""bikini"" that seems like more of a high cut then these will be fine. Otherwise, buyer beware."
2,Not that fashion,they were not that fashion. I receive what supposed to be my size but they were far bigger. Not modern disigns.
5,Excellent Product,Bought this to hold a kitchen utility rack on a tiled back splash. Has been on for a week so far and it has held. Prior to this I had used another Scotch product with the red backing that did not hold up. Started to come loose after about 2 weeks. Will update this after a month.
2,The Las Dino-BORE!,"Some reviews of this film say that it is the BEST KAIJU EIGA film ever. Those people are on DRUGS!!! Richard Boone looks and sounds drunk through the whole movie. To make matters worse we are supposed to believe that women find him irresistible even though he looks like a rotten log in a safari hat!!! Joan Van Ark is so irritating and whiney that you'll want one of the dinosaurs to eat her! And let's talk about the other guy--some young scientist guy who must have attended the William Shatner school of over-acting and FLUNKED! ...However it is also very funny in some parts. My favorite is when the title dino is bashed in the head with a Flintstone styled catapult, and we get to see the boulder litterally dent and bounce off of the creature's head like a Nerf ball. My advice--buy this movie used for a dollar, make fun of it, and throw it in your dumpster!"
3,A movie that could be more,"The last dinosaur is a film about a rich hunter and business tycoon (RICHARD BOONE) who learns of a living T-rex. He sets out to ""study it"" with a team comprised of a journalist (JOAN VAN ARK), a palentologist, Tribal tracker, and the pilot of a Polar Borer craft to take them under the polar ice to a hidden valley heated by a polar volcano. The team becomes stranded and the tycoon's real intentions become aparent. He plans to hunt and kill the T-rex as the ultimate hunter's prize...no matter what the cost! The 70's filming is apparent as the dinosaurs are Ok for the time period by truely cheesey for today's era of CGI. Acting and plot are good...at times. I would love to see this film remade with the concept and production methods updated. As for the original, if you are a dino movie fan, it's a must see at least once."
4,Drill Press,"This little drill press is great for a young woodworker. So far, it has been a pleasure to work with. The spring loaded chuck prevents the chuck key from staying in, thus preventing ""chuck key flyout"" when the drill press is turned on. A great idea, this feature makes the drill a lot safer to use, especially with kids. The pop out switch toggle prevents unauthorized use of drill press. The 5-speed feature is great for hard or soft wood, metals, and plastic. The only thing I find indesirable is that the chuck could always go a little bit deeper. A nice little machine; just what you'd expect from Delta!"
3,mediocre book,it is a bit boring at first but towards the middle the book seems more interesting as William grow up. I am not a historian and the numerous names isd really hard to follow!
5,Great Wisk!,This wisk is a great way to clean your seasoned wok without scratching the surface! Makes a great companion to any iron or steel wok!
5,Very useful product,This product is very useful for your wok and works very well. I would highly recommend this product for use with your wok.
4,Excellent exploration on ideas of making,"I was looking for concepts related to digital making, and how these techniques can derive from and be informed by traditional making practices(craft). This book delves into those ideas, though not in an intensely focussed manner. I recommend this for individuals interested in the intellectual/philosophical framing of such concepts, histories, and practices of making(craft)."
3,ooops.... (blush),"yiks! i never knew there were other twin towers in other places.AND i ALWAYS thoought that OUR twin towers were the tallest buildings in the world! (just shows how much i know huh?)well, o.k. what do you expect from a simple girl growing up in the city and who never went to college... i only know what i see, and to me the twin towers LOOKED like the tallest buildings in the world i still miss them. it still HURTS to look in that direction. tha towers that used to decorate the skyline of my city are gone, but im happy to know that somewhere in another city there are other twins. good to know. thanks."
4,Holiday Special!,"I am a huge Brian McKnight fanatic! This has to be one of the best Christmas albums I've heard! Even though the songs aren't traditional, they leave you with a real connection with the true meaning of Christmas. You won't get the warm fuzzies you normally get with the traditional Christmas albums. Instead, you get the heart wrenching tug that reminds you of why we really celebrate the holiday. If you haven't already added this to your collection, please do! You won't be disappointed! I would have to say ""It's all about Love"" performed with McKnight Jr would have to be my favorite."
4,Brian McKnight's Christmas album a huge success,"Brian McKnight's Christmas CD release showcases his wide range of talent. His ""Nat King Cole"" immitation on ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"" was so convincing that I had to look twice to make sure that Mr. Cole had not made a ""guest (ghost)"" appearance.This album showcased the talent of the McKnight extended family. Artists (and upcoming artists) such as Claude McKnight of the renowned group Take 6, his two sons, his wife, and a song featuring his family (including in-laws).This is an ideal album to play in the background during Christmas dinner, and a very appropriate album to play around the kids (unlike many of his other albums).....The perfect album to get you into the Christmas Spirit."
5,Very Helpful Book,This book was awesome and such a great help for our trip. The charts for each park that shows fear factor and height requirement was super helpful. We also bought the other unofficial guide to Disney and this one was by far the best. This one is easy to read and direct. The other book adds alot of unneeded jibberish.
5,This book saved us time and money $$,I bought this book looking for insight as we had never done Disney before and were going to be travelling with 4 children. What I found was a huge wealth of information and money saving tips. This book saved our sanity and wallets!
5,great book,"The book is aimed at adults, Michael, and offers incredible advice for those able to read. It has helped me with several wonderful trips to Disney. I've given it to my literate friends, who also find it an invaluable guide to easing the frustrations of Disney. And Disney World CAN be frustrating.The advice on dining will save any family money and vexation. So if you are a responsible adult planning a vacation to Disney with kids, this is a great place to start."
5,Not Just For Kids Anymore,"I don't usually write reviews for books... I usually just read them! But after seeing the last review written on this book I decided that someone that knows how to read should write one :) I am now 41 years young... I say this in large part because when I go to Disney World I realize why I work so hard everyday! TO ENJOY LIFE... I am sure that I would enjoy my time at Disney World even if I had not had the pleasure of reading Ms. Wiley's book... But it has become a tradition to buy this book as soon as the new years edition comes out! It allows me to see all the wonderful new sites, as well as how best to see ""Them all"" in the short time that I am there... I highly recommend this book as the best way to ""See Disney World"" before you get there!!!"
4,Best Barker Adaptation,"Of all the Barker stories penned or adapted to film I can think of (Hellraiser, Rawhead Rex, Lord of Illusions, Nightbreed, Valerie Under the Stairs, Haeckle's Tale), this is the best. The director did a great job with the shots/angles to really give the film that extra level of creepiness. The acting was good, the script solid, and though there were some conveniences in the plot, the overall quality is of such it was easy for me to overlook that.Other reviewers have summed up the plot nicely, just wanted to show the world that my thumbs are up on this for what its worth..."
5,"""Meat is Murder?""","First of all, this is more of a commentary than a review, so please don't look for any help here because you won't find any. I was going to look through all 91 reviews to be sure no one else has thought of this, but forget that, this is just too funny to pass up. My question is this? Did the people who did the casting for ""Midnight Meat Train"" intentionally cast someone who was the spitting image of Morrissey as the deranged butcher? Inquiring minds want to know. I mean, think how pissed off the guy must be, he's a strict vegan, after all! C'mon Clive, was it your idea? Fess up, big guy! That's the only thing I could think of the entire time I first watched the film, ""THE FRIGGING KILLER LOOKS JUST LIKE MORRISSEY!"" It was all I could do not to completely bust a gut right in the theater! By the way, excellent film, scary as all hell, great dvd. If you collect horror, buy it, it's that simple."
5,OMG! I wasn't expecting that much gore!,"Wow, this movie is something else! Its as gory as them cheap made horror films but its got a ""blockbuster"" feel to it. I liked it, it completely caught me off guard with all of the gore, and the twists. I'm really into horror movies and this one was nearly too much for me, nearly but not bad enough to keep me from watching it again. This movie is pretty different from other movies in the genre and that's what I like most about it. If you consider yourself a ""horror fan"" then you should check this one out. Man, I just can't shake some of the scenes from this movie..."
5,one of the best horror movies out there,"i caught this on SyFy 1 months ago and have become addicted to the movie so much that i had to buy it! i read the book by Clive Barker and love the screen adaptation of the book. i wish the movie had gotten more publicity. Hopefully they will re-release the movie to the big screen again. I highly recommend this to horror movie fans, Vinnie Jones plays Mahogany perfectly!!!"
5,"Exquisite, Etherial, Spiritual, and Mesmerizingly Beautiful!","This collection contains music which takes one to another time and place. It is a top-notch collection of music which is unforgetable, and listening to it is a spiritual experience which leaves one breathless and deeply touched. The exquisite voice of Connie Dover begins this collection, and each song thereafter is the same calibre as the first. Lilting melodies, haunting performances and exquisite voices all make this a must-have addition for anyone who loves Celtic music, and for anyone who likes Enigma, Loreena McKennitt, and Enya. Get a magic carpet and listen to the soundbites. Highly, highly recommended!"
5,Beautiful; peaceful; classic Celtic,"This was one of the cd's I put with the cd player we gave my mother when she started getting suddenly really sick with cancer, and she played it a lot. I hope, and think it must have had to take her mind off for a while at least. My other 4 sisters and I do some traditional songs, and we sang ""Rosa Mystica"" (which we first heard on this CD), voices-only, at her funeral Mass -- she had a very close relationship with Mary and the Rosary and there couldn't have been a more fitting song. This is a great traditional Celtic album; haunting but so beautiful. Doesn't sound at all like your typical church music but is very spiritual and would actually work well for meditation of any kind, as well as just being a very beautiful album."
5,Compensating . . .,". . . for the ""non-listener"" who just rated this CD three stars and admitted they hadn't even listened to it! First, why bother reviewing it if you haven't heard it! And drag down the overall score as well! This CD is beautiful by the way and deserves a full five stars. I am purchasing it again as a gift."
4,The Great Escape Toy!!!,"This toy is fun and enjoyable. Very convenient- though I still enjoy playing the Jumble game in the newspapers, this toy is so much easier to handle and store away. I keep it in my bathroom and use it as the great escape!"
5,A Gem,"This book's a gem, both history-wise and food-wise (I have another Lewis & Clark cookbook, it pales in comparison on both counts). The history is woven throughout the book in easy-to-swallow bits and bites. The recipes are very do-able, easy even, in home kitchens. I expected some 'weird' ingredients but there are none. Definitely a recommendation for cooks along the Expedition route but interesting for lots of folks, I think."
4,The food Journal of Lewis & Clark,"I checked this book out of a libary in Colorado that was just a little better, meaning the paper was more interesting. It was soft, thick, with an old book edge to the paper. This one I received is just fine, same print but the paper had been changed. Good but not like the one in Colorado which must have been an early printing. Great idea in the content of this book and the way all things come together."
3,Not bad,"This is an easy way to level your scope, but for my Ruger American 30-06, it didnt seem to fit well in the chamber, I had to kinda mess around with it to make sure it was level because the magnet kept sticking to an uneven place. I wish it was a little easier in that regard."
5,Great level set,I really like this kit. I found it to be a necessity when leveling your scope to your action and despite others reviews it really does work. Don't waste your time trying to line it up straight without one of these because you probably wont get close
2,Only lasted for 5 months,I bought this to check my recent installation of a Nikon scope. It worked well the first time I used it. The next time I used it was 3 months later because the nikon on my .300WinMag shifted due to recoil. It worked well for that job too. When predator 'season' was getting close I wanted to check my gear before wasting a morning with un-level sights. The plastic on the bottom of the units was begining to warp! Neither unit would read level even on a surface that was proven to be so by my larger levels. I expected a piece of gear that would last through more than 4-5 months.
4,Noah's Ark,The ark is very durable. My granddaughter liked the doors and windows. The figures are of good size and very colorful. I wonder why there isn't Noah's wife?
4,My nephew really liked it.,I thought this product was really cute and My nephew really seems to enjoy it. It would be nice if it included Noah's wife.
3,Not as cool as I thought,"Got this for a gift for our son for Christmas. It looked really neat online, but it was smaller than we thought it would be. It's also a little awkward to take the top off and on, and that is really the only way to get the animals in and out, since there is only one door on the backside, and the 3 windows on the front are too small for them to fit though. I'm sure my son will love it regardless. And the colors aren't as vibrant as they are in the picture, either."
5,outstanding,"This is a very very good CD. The whole CD is nice. I love the Temptations. I did not know the Temptations sing Memories. Everytime I listen to memories, it makes me cry. It's a beautiful song. I like every song on this CD. Memories is my special song."
4,It served me well,"I have owned this saw for 4 years and, despite all of the shortcomings mentioned by the other reviewers, I found that it has served my quite well. I have done a number of projects on it from very small to very large (including a 9 foot tall corner display cabinet). From my beginnings as a woodworker 4 years ago, until today, this saw has been my workhorse. The fence is surprisingly accurate for a low cost saw. I never have to check the fence measurement, it is always right on. On the bad side, I never trusted the blade angle measurement. It is very difficult to adjust and I just never did it.I made the usual assortment of sleds and jigs to perform any number of tasks including raised panels, long stock, straightening natural edge boards, etc.Now, I am moving up to a cabinet saw. But, I will never regret the purchase of the 36-600."
1,A bit boring... Some good sections... Not much :-(,"I was so excited about this book when I read the summary and ordered it right away. The first chapter went well but it went downhill (or uphill) from there until the last few pages. Lots of passion filled experiences, which was nice and there were some parts which were very poetic...but overall it was a tough read. Sorry. Maybe someone else will have a different point of view. Not recommended."
5,super product,"Original, traditional, and functional product from China! When I bought this for my wok (from wokshop), I doubted if this really works. But the hard yet flexibility bamboo strips prove itself a much better cleaning tool than those scrubbing pad made of synthetic material.For removing the food residual among the bamboo strips, simply stir it vigorously in a pot of warm/hot water, with or without detergent. Although I never observed any mold on the brush, hanging it over window sill to dry is a good practice: the UV light can prevent fungi forming."
1,Poor quality,"I got one of these yesterday and immediately took it back. I am a woodworker by hobby and needed to do particular sanding. I found the packaging excellent, but that's where it stops. Yes it sands. The verticle plate in back of the 1"" belt was 1/4 inch to the left and cannot be adjusted. It was also bent back 15 degrees and not flush to the belt. The throat is not deep, so, sanding a part of a piece of wood longer that a 10 inches cannot be done. Metal parts were jagged and dangerous, especially the little tables. The miter gauge with the disk sander table is small and wobbled in the miter slot and therefore useless for any specific angle of cut. All in all a very cheesy product. If a straight line or a 90 degree angle is of any interest to a user, leave this product on the shelf."
3,Good microphone for the price,"I wanted a microphone which would work with voice recognition software. The advertising said that this microphone was, ""ideal for voice recording, voice recognition software or telephony over the internet."" Ideal is not the word I'd use.I tested the microphone with the voice recognition software. It came back with a below average rating and a warning that the voice recognition software might not work well with it.In many cases, low quality voice recognition is worse than no voice recognition at all. Often I'll have to undo what the computer thought I told it to do. They say that a computer only does what you tell it to do. If the microphone does not clearly hear what you are saying, it will take a guess.The bottom line is that for voice recognition, a higher quality microphone is needed. In a pinch if your keyboard and mouse were inoperative you might be able to make the voice recognition software work using this microphone. Personally I'd just turn off the computer."
3,Should be finer..,"This screen is great for heavy sanding on drywall. Not really a medium grit though, more like a heavy grit sandpaper. Lasts long and does the job great, especially if you have a shop vac attached to it to keep the dust down."
3,Get your facts straight...,"Mary Kay hasn't conducted animal testing since 1989 and has signed the ""Peta Pledge"" years ago. Bloom County is great but it didn't sway Mary Kay...."
4,Needs updating,"This book was published in 1978. Though the new Hippocrene printing (2000) is billed as an update, there have in fact been no changes made to the text. An ""index of names"" is appended; that is all.Though the work still has considerable value (it is, after all, a history of a group who have been deeply involved in the United States since before the rebellion against Great Britain) it takes no account of the relation of the Poles to America since the rise of Solidarity and the demise of Communism and the superstate that imposed that perverse system on Poland. Readers will have to look elsewhere for an assessment of the effect of Polish independence on American migration and how both may have been influenced by globalization generally."
5,A Good Reveiw,I belive this is a very well made game and should make a lot of money. There are so many maps and tricks to this game that it makes the play length never end. I downloaded the demo and i was playing one map for a total of like 5 hours in about a week and after that i was still finding out new tricks. This game is a must for all the skaters out there and people that just wanna get a good score on a awsome skateboarding game.
5,Greatest game ever,"This game is absolutely awesome. It has consumed my life for the last month. Every time you think you have done everything in the game, you find out you have just started. Get through all the levels- you still gotta 100% them. Beat it with one person-there is still like 10 more skaters. Beat it with every skater-you still can go back and get all the gaps. This game is absolutely addictive. It is very challenging, but the great thing is that if you keep at it, you will get it. It is slightly unrealistic ( you can't do 15 different grinds with flip tricks in between each on one rail in real life), but that is part of what makes it fun. Worth every single cent."
1,This is not a Gomadic Brand Product,"I would like to mention that we (Gomadic) do not authorize Eforcity to use our name in the title or branding of this product. Do not be fooled, this is *NOT* a Gomadic Brand listing nor is it covered under our warranty. This product was not made by Gomadic nor is it sold by Gomadic."
4,Yeah! Bring on Mylon and Alvin Lee!,"I'm with the person from Franklin Tennessee! I've been looking for that ""Road"" album as a CD for years - I've yet to find it! Bring it back as a CD! Alvin, Mylon and George Harrison were a poignant, dreamy team!"
1,a void here,"Let's see, we've got 16 reviews of an album that has nothing to do with the album being reviewed. And one review from someone who wants to push his religions on everyone else, which is frankly offensive. So I can only give this non album one star.And by the way folks, ON THE ROAD TO FREEDOM has been released on CD already."
1,outdated batteries,Best Deals sells outdated batteries. All the batteries had an expiration date of 09/2011 on them. Also they were not in Duracell packaging as the website picture shows. Makes one wonder if they bought a huge bunch of outdated batteries and are now trying to rip off buyers. Best Deals has a history of doing this if you read back in feedback on this company. Whish I had read back and I wouldn't have ordered from them. They also never replied to my emails. I filed an A-Z guarantee claim with Amazon. Amazon has also referred this seller to their investigation unit. It is a shame a seller like this tarnishes the excellant reputation Amazon has. No wonder the batteries were so cheap.
1,Counterfeit Batteries,"DO NOT BUY! These are counterfeit batteries that do not come in Duracell packaging. They are obviously other batteries, possibly used, that are wrapped in a Duracell label."
2,I found this to be rather poor,"It seems I stand alone in not liking this version of Alice in Wonderland. Having read the book, I know what is happening, yet I feel people not exactly fimilar with the story (Disney's version isnt good enough)would find it dry and lacking in a good solid story persay. Things are very quickly jumped into, and hardly any lines on the part of Alice. She is compleltly out of it and stares blankly off into space most of the time. Over all I found this version of Alice lacking and dull."
5,MOTIVATING,"This book was motivating, must read. Any person especially a Marine will enjoy every step of the story of Gunnery Sergeant Basilone."
2,Lead paint,"Just bought this fan from Walmart. Not surprisingly, it was from China. I opened it up, and on the fan (but not on the package), it says something along the lines of ""Warning: This fan has parts including lead that have been known to cause birth defects and other reproductive issues in the state of California. Wash hands after touching.""Since I bought this to cool the back seats where my babies are, it seems like a bad idea to have lead paint particles blowing in their faces. Planning on finding a US made one.The fan worked though."
2,not my style of sausauge.,The packagage arrived promptly. It was a gift for the holidays. The sausage seemed to have more Fat and was greasier than I was used to. Your mileage may vary
3,Opinionated and obsessional,"This book makes some good points, but the author is quite opinionated (for example, his view is the ""correct"" view of what a good recording is) so that his advice is misleading. He also does an obsessional counting of words in the TRANSLATION of the Ring, which is not very useful since the original is in German and different translators render Wagner's words differently. I read the book through once and never returned to it, which says something about its usefulness. In contrast, for example, the books by Bryan Magee, I return to again and again for fresh insights into the Ring. Overall, this book is a disappointment and probably not worth buying. It will just take up space on your bookshelf."
4,Bissell SpotBot,I use this often especially having pets and grandchildren. I would recommend this product to friends. It is light weight and very easy to use.It sure beats dragging the heavy carpet cleaner around.
1,Disposable junk,"Works OK for about a year then it breaks down like the cheap piece of poor engineering it is. That's probably why the warranty is only good for a year. It's a rip-off, save your money."
4,All But Perfect!,"I purchased the Bissel SpotBot from Amazon using a gift certificate that I received for a wedding gift. I'm extremely pleased with it. We live in an apartment with very pale-beige carpets and have a cat and dog who always seem to make messes! I've had great success cleaning up mud and pet stains with this machine, using both the automatic mode and the hand-held wand attachment. The only thing that I didn't have much luck with was getting freshly-spilled coffee cleaned up; it did a fairly good job but still left a bit of a ""shadow"" on the carpet. Overall though, this little machine is a savior for apartment life!"
1,I'd give it 0 stars if that was possible,"This thing stinks. And I did not even get it going. The priming problem is real. What a pain. How do corporations get away with this? Because consumers allow them to! I mean, look at all the problems in these reviews with priming, and so many people say, ""But, gee, I finally got it working."" I mean, is that a standard to aspire to?Now, the real question is, ""Will Amazon allow this review to be posted?"""
3,Ultra Violence on the Steam,"PotBot bowling ball de-greaser and sanitizer is an uninhibited no nonsense machine which compresses stale air, making numerous ""sucking and gurgling"" noises that neutralize the ball's surface, allowing it to become ideal again and used in smoky bowling arenas. Also can be used atop the head's of bald men to get that ""shiny French tough guy"" look. Works well with most of Boorbal's fungus shampoos and can even be used to remove track marks on old linoleum floors made from years of drunken country dances."
4,Is It Worth The Money? Well...,"One ""new"" 30-year old house:$100,000One rescue puppy to live in house with son: $100New carpet to replace the Filthy Beige Nightmare that came in the""new"" house: $5,000 (not likely!)One Spot Bot on Amazon.com, after all discounts and free shipping:$102One large container of Pet Carpet Cleaner from Amazon.com after free shippng: $20Sitting in my recliner watching the 5 year old and his father argue about who gets to ""Spot Bot"" the dog pee out of the carpet:*******PRICELESS :0)***********"
3,It's okay,"It's okay. It cleans about 40% of the carpet stains we get. It doesn't clean the orange, red or yellow stains left from cat vomit. (Sorry!) It lightens them a little, but a more intensive cleaning is needed for them. (And with 2 ancient cats, this kind of staining is my life.) There's also a dark residue from the elliptical trainer and treadmill that the bot doesn't do more than swish around. Actually, many stains are merely swished around, rather than cleaned. On the 40% of simple dirt type of messes, it's great and a lot less work."
3,Not what we wanted.,"The Bissell 1200B was small and easy to carry around. It would be good for small jobs but, it didn't remove all the liquid that was put on the carpet. The carpet was still too wet after the cleaner went through its full cycle."
1,Not such a hot botspot,"I wish I could tell you this worked terrific like the other reviews, but it did not. I had more luck on the pet stains using peroxide and vinegar. Very disappointed."
4,"Good idea, but......","I had considered getting the SpotBot after seeing all of the commercials on TV, I thought it might be good for getting the mysterious black spots on my light beige carpet out. Well, after a horrible incident with a whole rotisserie chicken, I decided that it was time to try it out. I raced to the local Linens 'N Things and picked one up. Here is what I found:1. It did not come with the ""clear storage tray"" that other people have found missing also.2. Using the ""new stain"" setting, which is 3 minutes, it left a dark ring around the clean area3. Using the ""set-in old stain"" setting, which is 6 minutes, it cleaned the whole area.4. It left the circles I cleaned looking cleaner than the rest of the carpet!5. The SpotBot leaked at one of the seams on the side of the machine when cleaning. Not a huge problem, but annoying.All in all, this machine did pretty much what it was advertised to do, and it would be great to go along with a large full-carpet cleaner for quick spot cleaning."
5,Must Get This!,"I have so, so many carpet cleaners. I buy them due to my pet (cat) stains. I have been reluctant to buy new carpeting because of all the messes I am always cleaning up. I tried this machine and was absolutely surprised and impressed. I used it on old and new stains. It worked perfectly. If you are like me and are always trying to find equipment that can tackle stains, this is it. I have also used it for messes my grandson made with strawberry milk (discovered days later) and it worked like a charm! I don't think you can go wrong with this machine. I have now replaced ""my little green machine"" which didn't seem to work as well."
4,Great machine!,"Love it. If you have animals, it is a must (to prevent musty). It would be better if it covered a larger area. It usually takes 3 applications to get all of the animal stain."
4,This thing does really work,After reading all the reviews we were a little skeptical but taking all of that into consideration we decided to give it a try and it WORKED! We didn't have the issue with priming and realized that it's called the SpotBot for a reason and only expected it to clean a spot. We had a soda/dirt stain on off white carpet that Oxyclean helped but then it came back. The SpotBot got out the biggest part then we used the hose for the part that was outside of the circle. One negative thing is that it does use a lot of the cleanser with just one use. We're definitely happy we tried it. Better than covering it with a rug!
4,Totally Impressed!!,I tried this out the minute I got it..I have a little doggie that has accidents on my carpet. It got up the spot perfectly. The only drawback is it uses a lot of the cleaning solution. I had to go out the next day and purchase more of the solution. All in all it's a great little machine to have ...there has been no other outlet to cleaning these accidents up perfectly until now. I agree with others who stated they have clean circles everywhere they used the machine! Now my carpet needs a complete overhaul !! It's a very handy item !!
2,Leaves spots of its own,"While the Spotbot is good at removing all types of stains on the carpet, you'll find yourself left with even more noticeable patches on your carpet. We've had our Spotbot for about six months. Unfortunately every time we use it it does something to the carpet which causes dirty patches to form much faster. Now we've got loads of circles on our carpet which are very evident to visitors."
3,Spot Bot Review,Product not exactly what I thought it would be. I was disappointed to find it for $60 at BJ's the week following my purchase. Ease of use is not what it should be and I think if it had better suction that would be an improvement.m Also disappointed that I had to purchase the attachment. For the price it should have been included.
3,It's slightly more promise than delivery,"This is a super deep cleaner, for certain, but its price simply doesn't justify its functionality. It is too difficult to use, setup, and clean AFTER you've cleaned your carpets."
4,"Works well, very pleased","Very easy to use, cleans the pet spots very nicely. As other reviwers ahev noted, it does leave the carpet looking a little odd with all these clean circles."
4,Great idea for a great product,"I bought the SpotBot from Amazon on the advice of a co-worker and based on the reviews here. I was a little nervous because of some of the bad reviews but thought it was worth a try. We have basically clean carpet with lots of small spots all over so we might be the perfect market for this device.Out of the box, the sprayer didn't spray. I called customer service, got right through (bonus star!) and was told to prime the unit as follows:1. Get a bowl of warm water2. Suck up the bowl with the hose (i.e. manual mode)3. Hold down the Manual button for 30 seconds.I did and it started spraying immediately. I just cleaned up two stains that were very set-in and almost impossible to clean by hand. Wow, I'm very impressed.The only minor complaint is that the unit tends to leave an excess of water behind. This is easily managed with the manual hose which sucks it up very nicely."
5,Wow! This REALLY works!,"I bought my SpotBot a few weeks ago and TODAY was the day I really needed it! I have three cats who, on occasion, like to do the ""Kitty Upchuck"" thing on my white carpet. Well, this morning I found a nice little ""surprise"" at the foot of the stairs. Grabbing my Spotbot,I followed the instructions carefully, started the unit, and after a very short cleaning cycle, the spot was GONE! This machine is so easy to use! I will be saving a lot of money on professional carpet cleaning in the future, so this machine will pay for itself in no time! I just told my cats that they can barf as much as their little hearts desire! I have my SpotBot now!!"
2,hmph... circles on my rug,"I thought I would love and this.. and I did. That is until circles started appearing in a ll the places I used the spot bot on my rug. They keep getting darker, as if the cleaning fluid is slowly staining the carpet. And! on a light carpet, it's really noticeable. We thought we were buying this product to save us money on our rent deposit. It will probably end up costing us money... and we live with big spots everywhere. hmph"
5,"Ten stars, at least!","I read many reviews before purchasing this product. Yes, it leaves a slightly damp spot, you can blot that up while re-fluffing the carpet. Or not. It dries quickly. With an old dog and old cat at home, we find this is nothing short of a wonder. Position the Spot Bot, push a button, done. Carpet clean and fresh smelling. Easy to clean an refill. Go for it!"
1,absolute rubbish,The spotbot is a piece of JUNK after you use it press some paper towel over the area just cleaned (joke) and see how much filth is left behind but it is very useful as a door stop
2,Great until it quits working...,"Like many other reveiwers, I was initially quite enthusiastic about the Spot Bot--seemed to do the job as advertised, and was great for the quick clean-up. However, I've only used this about a dozen times and today is just stopped--mid cycle. Sigh. There is no power to the machine, and the power light does not come on. I did the trouble-shooting tips (checked the breaker, tried another outlet, examined the hose and cord), but with no luck. I suspect it's the circuit board (like some other reviewers have mentioned) and thus not repairable. That's too bad, because a machine should last more than a dozen times. Just to echo what others have said, I also called the customer service call center. No luck, no help, just a long wait on hold. Very disappointed with the reliability of this machine and the lack of customer service."
3,Bissell 1200B SpotBot,"The Spot Bot does a good job cleaning the stain up BUT........ It leaves circles in the carpet where it's cleaned and it uses A LOT of liquid really fast. I've sort of fixed the circle problem by using a brush on the spot so as to make the circle blend into the rest of the carpet. But can't do anything besides put more water and less liquid cleaner in the machine. It did although get up ink in my carpet, to my surprise."
4,"good product, better with modifications","I use this cleaner by putting soap in a sprayer and spray it on the stain, then I fill the tank with really hot water and set the cleaner to clean the stain as directed by machine. After finished I use the hose to suck up any left over water on carpet. I think this also helps not to waste the soap (there is none left in the machine to dump out). So far it has been really good at cleaning stains left by my aging dog...YUCK!"
4,Fun but nothing ground-breaking,"OK, I'm about halfway through the single player campaign and I've played quite a bit of the multiplayer. It is a lot of fun. The graphics are stellar as is the sound. BUT, it keeps seeming like a bit of ""been there, done that."" If you've played No One Lives Forever, you will immediately find numerous similarities: from the chatter between guards to the stealth-style required in many missions. It's not that it's bad, since NOLF was a helluva game, but it's deja vu all over again. That being said, it still a fun game, visually and viscerally.The multiplayer is quite a bit of fun but netcode could still use a little tweaking methinks. The life of this game will be defined by the mod-ability of it. I don't think the multiplayer modes as they exist today will play out for that long on their own -- again a bit of ""been there"" with some of the Half Life WWII mods. BUT this engine has huge potential if they help the mod community along. It's just so gorgeous."
3,"Lacks ""oomph!""","Return to Castle Wolfenstein (RTCW) was something I'd been looking forward to for a long time. I ran out and bought a copy the first day of release. If I'd known what a vanilla gameplay experience I was in for, I would've waited for the price to go down! (I paid [money] for the tin edition). The graphics, sound and music are all first rate. However, I'm past the point of ""Find key, shoot bad guy, go to next level"", I expect a little more from my games nowadays and RTCW did not deliver with its single player experience.Multiplayer, however, is a different story altogether. If you have a fat pipe connecting you to the internet (or go to LAN parties a lot) - RTCW is definitly worth a look."
1,why the freaky creatures?!,"I borrrowed the game from a friend and installed it on my computer (p3 866 mHz, GF2 64mb, 256 mb ram) and at first had no trouble playing it. I was kind of impressed by the whole thing at first, but probably maily because it was the first shooter i played in about 1 year...Then it happened: i tried to pause the game and my computer froze. first time in the game. from then on, every time i stopped moving for about 1 minute, the game froze. Quite annoying, but i can live with it...But when i continued into the tomb, 2nd objective or something, i noticed the zombies and skeletons. After i emptied about 100 rounds at the BULLETPROOF shields of the skeletons (from an age when bulletproof armour didnt exist) i got fed up with the whole thing and decided i didnt like the whole skeleton, zombie, freaky stuff. Not my kind of thing. The next thing i did was press the uninstall button...I guess i should wait for medal of honour, since that should be great..."
4,Quite Interesting Piece of Work,This game was designed quite well but all in all its a bit short. I do recommend buying it even if you have never played the original. Worth the 50 dollars but not much more than that. The replay value is a bit low
5,A good read,He supports his opinions with facts and outside studies. A good background review for those interested in learning more about the church.
4,Small window fan,This fan blows some air but the cord is about 3 ft .it is to short for me. have to use extension cord which i do not like.
2,"Unique fan, quite loud","I purchased this fan because I have an 18.5"" square window. Amazon's description says this is for 18"" windows. Unfortunately, the box states it is for 19""x20"" windows. This is no really Lasko's fault, however. The main issue with this fan is it is annoyingly loud -- even on the lowest speed. Not quite as loud as my portable air conditioner, but close to it. If you plan on spending much time within 12' of this fan, I suggest you look else where. That being said, it does move a lot of air and if you are looking for a window fan for an unused portion of the house, then this may be ideal for you."
2,So So CD,"I've been playing New Age music for a very long time, and I have personally met New Age masters like John Tesh and Yanni, and Yanni being my favorite. I would suggest to any listeners to not buy David Lanz cd. Once you've heard 3 songs, the rest you know. He does not distinct himself from his peers. Try Yanni's IN MY TIME cd, a grammy nominated cd. You will enjoy, and is great for any type of listeners."
2,Mundane,"Basically, all the songs are nothing more than very, very slow plunking at a piano. There is very little distinction between one song and any other. The songs are unimaginative as well, and sometimes the arrangment of different sounds borders on random. I didn't give it one star because music has to give me a headache to do that. (Some music actually does.) I very highly recommend Yanni. His music is magnificient. Some songs are fast, some are slow, and his orchestra/band contains a wide variety of musical instruments. Of course once someone makes several dozen musical pieces some are going to seem repetitive, but the uniqueness between Yanni's songs are a magnitude greater than that of David Lanz's. I do regret spending money on this CD."
3,Small but nice!,"Game is smaller than your regular gameboards, it is nice and I put it as a centerpiece for my sons's birthday party."
2,"interesting concepts, end leaves readers hanging",I do not consider this book to be a page turner but I did find it interesting. Unfortunately it ends on a cliff-hanger that requires the purchase of another book. Reading the reviews for that book evidently it's not very good. This is all very unfair to the reader.This was my first Dan Simmons book and I expect that it will be my last.
5,Why should you read this book?,Here's why. It's good. Very good. Dan Simmons takes some of our oldest and most cherished stories and pairs them with some of our newest science. Interesting characters and intricate plots keep you guessing as to what will happen next. I am eagerly awaiting the next book in the series. I like this book and regularly reccommend it to friends.
5,Great si-fi read for the over 40 crowd,"Great si-fi fantacy for mature readers who can fully appreciate an out of shape, over-weight, over 40 character getting to do Helen of Troy. A good read."
4,"Great epic, some rough spots, leaves you hanging","One of Simmons's better books! Told from several different points of view, the tale leaves many questions unanswered. Just a few: who are these ""gods?"" What is the relationship between the Troy being monitored in the story and the Troy of old Earth? What happened to the post-humans? And biggest of all - how's it going to end?That's right, friends, just as in his Endymion series Simmons leaves all threads hanging at the end of the novel. So if you're not in the mood to buy the sequel (Olympos) and don't like unanswered questions, stay away. On the other hand, there are intriguing characters, surprising plot twists, ingenious speculative science, and much simple pleasure to be had in this book. I'm glad I read it and recommend it for those who don't mind buying the second book or who are happy leaving the plot lines hanging at the end of this one."
5,manna for the soul,"I go back to this book when I feel drawn away from G_d. It is grounded, and its wisdom spans generations."
5,Sizzling Guitar,"i'm an amature but trust me this fusion of guitars is one of the BEST your ears could ever..rythym,skill,harmony all in one."
2,stick with repertoire,"Yes in the UK there was no America on this album. The Castle release gives no real benefit at all. The masters are from the UK issue which was poorly mixed and produced. A shame that the USA tapes for this and the third Nice Cd werent used they are much clearer. The Castle reissue shows up some more tape faults on Karelia and is a little bass light. Stick with the Repertoire issues if you can find them. The Castle reissue of ""Nice"" even has an awful edit between Rondo and She Belongs to Me"
4,great read,Whilst some of the weather facts can become slightly excessive & uninteresting the rest of the story is great. Looking forward to Jo's next drama
3,Review,"Was o.k, pretty much the same plot as every American flick - little fuzzy at the end, it didn't really clear anything up and left the watcher hanging"
2,Could have been a lot better.,"I have to say, I'm very disappointed. This movie wasn't good at all. The acting was good, but the story itself was horrible. I have 20 minutes left in the movie and I don't even wanna watch it."
4,Pretty good.,"Stephen J. Cannell,s second book, Final Victim is not as good as his first, The Plan but it is still a page turner. Mr. Cannell has a knack for creating characters. All of the leads are fascinating especially Karen Dawson a beatiful genious with an apparent compulsive obsessive personality. The villian is scary although a bit farfetched. The plot is chilling and ghoulish. This is part horror, part drama, part action adventure. A good book overall."
5,Works great!,I am using Duracell batteries for years. I didn't see any complaint so far. I prefer over other brands as they seems lasting longer.
2,Will not buy again,The batteries I received were not packaged as pictured. They were in clear containers that did not have a duracell label. You would not have known they were duracell if it didn't say so on the battery.
5,what batteries!,".Dear santa, how did you know? Thank you. I was spoiled for choice. This is far better than coal, again."
1,Amazon sent me the open box item,"This is where you shop online, and the items they sent you may or may not be as described. The Duracell battery I received is a open box item that was returned, and possibly used. I am very concerned about shopping at Amazon.com and so should everyone else."
3,A must have!,"With just about every handheld electronic, you need batteries. With Christmas right around the corner, you cant ask for a cheap and practical stocking stuffer!!"
5,Good price,Always nice to have a lot of batteries on hand! Especially at a good price for name brand batteries you know will last!
2,"Only 3 years, instead of 5 as promised","These were described as guaranteed for 5 years, but have an expiration date that is only 3 years (Mar 2016). Since I am using them for battery back-up in clocks this is a real bummer. Not what I expect from Amazon. Will probably live with it rather than mess with a return."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,I received my order today and was shocked that the product I ordered is NOT as is shown in the pictorial. Small box with loose batteries. Since this is a Christmas add-on gift it seems wrong to give it as a gift as a bunch of loose batteries. The problem with repackaging loose batteries comes from the fact that the loose batteries short out each other and charge is greatly diminished. Also not a practice approved by Duracell resellers. NEVER AGAIN Brooklyn Battery Works!!!
1,"poor batteries, better get them somewhere else","these batteries did not work in a newly purchased toy. they also did not work in another device. when tested, the power level was minimal. it is better to purchase your batteries at SAM's club."
4,Good batteries at a great price,"I like to have a lot of batteries stockpiled at home in case of earthquakes, etc. plus we just plain have a lot of electronic gadgets that go through these batteries. If you do the math, this is a very good deal for batteries. As far as I can tell these are of recent manufacture and do the job at a lot cheaper price than if you buy in retail stores. Duracells rightly have a reputation as being good batteries.One thing you should know is that the batteries do not come packaged as shown in the photo. They come in an unmarked white box; not shrink wrapped. Not sure what is up with that. RJB."
4,not disappointed,Got these at a good price when I bought them and so far so good. They were fresh as you want them to be and they work. Straight up exactly what you want in a battery.
1,Leaking - all of them,This company is not the same. All batteries of dura lock type has leaked. I will not buy this type anymore. Stay away if you want to save your electronics
1,"Package was opened, and who knows if the batteries even work","The batteries were in an opened package, which looked like it was pulled out of the garbage and taped shut. Obviously a return from someone else."
5,10 controllers,"So this was my go-to for Xbox controllers and I play quite often with my siblings. I would say that each controller had 2 batteries and lasted a few weeks, which was awesome considering I was playing like 6 hours a day everyday. I am going to buy this again for summer."
5,love Duracell,We've always used Duracell and can't be happier! They are the longest lasting batteries we've ever used specially in the toys that seem to eat batteries.
3,We'll See...,"Ordered 20pk of Duracell AA from Brooklyn Battery Works, so far the batteries seem ok but it's only been a week. I was not happy that they arrived in a small white box that WAS NOT ORIGINAL PACKAGING. The box had ""20PK AA"" written on it in pen... Probably won't be buying from these guys again."
2,They ain't the durolock,Not the durlock duracell batteries in the picture. False representing picture. Not sure why they have this picture and not the picture of the product I received.
2,Puzzled?????///,"Do not understand why prices are so high on Amazon. I like Amazon and do shop there frequently. Like Duracell batteries. Just purchased a pack of 8, 9volt Duracell batteries for $14.99 at Costco."
5,ALL GOOD,"I ordered this pack 1/16/2013 and received them 1/18/2013. They all had an expiration date of MAR 2018. I checked the batteries with a tester and they tested out with a solid ""GOOD"". They arrived in the same package as pictured."
3,shame on Amazon,I purchased this with Amazon as the vendor thinking I'd get a fresh product. The box looks old and the batteries don't look like the ones I get in the store. I think this is the first time I'm disappointed with a direct purchase from Amazon. I will try to update this review after use.Update: raising from 2 stars to 3 because the duracell batteries I received are made in USA. Not raising further than that due to the expiration date being 2 years earlier than the stock I see in local stores.
4,Wonderful collection...in a way,"This would be the ULTIMATE Faith Hill CD, except for a few minor setbacks:Setback No. 1: It doesn't have ""Wild One"" on it.No. 2: The rockier version of ""Piece of My Heart"" just doesn't fit Faith.No. 3: It doesn't have any songs from the ""It Matters To Me"" CD, which is one of her best.Now that the setbacks are out of the way, it's time to focus on the good parts of the album.For starters, it's the only place besides the Pearl Harbor Soundtrack where you can get ""There You'll Be"".It also has her hits from ""Breathe"" and ""Faith"", except for the duets with Tim McGraw (Another minor setback).It has ""Over The Rainbow"" on it, from the Oscars. Great thing to have.All in all, I'd buy this CD, for the remixes and ""There You'll Be"" -- but if you're looking for a Greatest Hits with ALL of Faith's hits on it, this isn't the CD for you."
1,ruining good songs,"I'm not upset about Faith choosing to make pop music instead of country from now on, but on this album Faith manages to ruin the country songs that made her famous. Songs like ""Let Me Let Go"" are re-done and ""diva-tised"". But we souldn't blame Faith, why not sell millions of records to buyers who are satisfied with so-so vocals, lyrics, and musical creativity? Bottom line, if you like Faith Hill buy her albums, not this collection, the only good song on the whole album is ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" but you can find better performances by other artists."
1,Not Good Enough,"I write this knowing how much I love to hear Faith Hill sing , and knowing how much of her Music that I own , and have listened to over theyears , this supposed to be Greatest Hits Ablum that leaves out some of her Hits ,adds these New Songs does away with what the Album is Called , and suppose to be , ""The Best OF Faith Hill"" , I DON'T THINK SO!"
2,Too much of old stuff,"Collection of old stories, nothing new, nothing fascinating, I struggled to get to the end of the book. It is like collection of newspaper articles that don't offer anything fresh."
5,"Interested in marco Polo, Mansa Musa, or Ibn Battuta? Try this one, too.","Straightforward book of the wanderings of a Jewish man around the Mediterranean and Persia in the 1100's. Does not go much into the dangers of travel, and mostly recounts how unpleasant and difficult the journey itself was. Tells briefly some of what there was to see.I was troubled to see that this book claims (in passing) that the captive Israelites built Egypt's great pyramids. The pyramids were already a thousand years old when the Bible's Joseph was in Egypt. This is a fairly common misconception, but it would be nice for books like this to set the record straight."
3,What Happened?,"I absolutely love Rilo Kiley's fist two albums. Take Offs And Landings and The Execution Of All Things have been almost constantly in my CD player for two or three years. I never get tired of them. More Adventurous, however, just does not cut it for me. Some songs are semi-decent, and others I just don't like at all. Over all, it doesn't compare with the band's earlier work for me. Maybe 2.5 stars would describe it better. If you like Rilo Kiley, check out The Elected - an amazing band with some members from Rilo Kiley."
4,Rilo Kiley continues to please,"I would really really like to give this CD 5 stars but I just can't bring myself to do it.Their last CD was one of the most amazing things that I have ever heard and it still gets to me on that emotional level.That being said, I had extremely high expectations for the new CD. I'm not gonna say that I was let down, cause I wasn't, but it didn't quite meet those expectations.I'm not gonna write a big long review going through every song and i don't care who finds this helpful or not. But this CD is definiately worth having and is really amazing. Don't expect a repeat of their last CD or even ""Takeoffs and Landings"" (also amazing). It just can't compare. But it's worth the money."
1,"not their best, not even close.","It's really hard to say what I would give this album- I like the songs individually, but I don't think they're rilo kiley's best by any means, and I don't think they sound great as an album. The excecution of all things is so so much better- do yourself a favor and pick it up."
4,How Many Syllables Mario?,"This is a provocative comedy that shouldbe seen as a classic. It's still funny and innovativebut also tied to the positives and negativesof the Black Power movement of the latesixties and early seventies.Some of its humor is tied to outrageousness and politicallyincorrect language and sight gags. An example of this is a newly Black runfirm assigning someone to dunk bags of cash receivables through a basketball hoop. Another is the use ofthe board chairman's stuttering as a source of humor.This film seems to be lightly edited from the one I saw in the theater in 1969, That versionincluded a longer segment on the Borkman 6."
3,"A little vague, but kind of funny.","I saw this movie for the first time some 6 years ago on BET Starz network channel. I thought the movie was somewhat vague, but it kind of had me rolling a little. It was real funny seeing a black man take over a network and employ a bunch of people of color to run it. Antonio Fargas was out of his hookup as he is in some of his other roles as an actor. If you're the type who's really into black films, then it's worth getting. If not, keep your dollars in your pocket."
1,Tv swivel base,"Product does not swivel easily at all. In fact, it would be the equivalent of putting your tv on a block of wood and trying to swivel it. My tv only weighs maybe 30 or 40 pounds and the base is supposed to support tv's up to 100 pounds. It was a waste of ten bucks."
4,Great quality - no cover,CD was in great shape. Great music for anyone who likes Arthur. No cover - which would have included list of songs and maybe lyrics.
5,Fantastic Fun!,"If you love the show ""Arthur"", you'll love this cd. My son and I watch the show almost every day and we really have fun listening to the cd in the car on the way to and from school. It's upbeat, funny, silly, and all our favorite songs were on it from the show. The ""Library Card"" song is my favorite! I know you'll love it...give it a try!"
4,A kid's CD adults will enjoy,"Your kids will love this one...if they can get it away from you! I love watching Arthur with my daughter because it's funny without being stupid, educational without being finger-wagging, and safe for kids without being sappy or syrupy. The same is true with this CD. The music, ranging from reggae to hip hop to classical to folk, stands up on its own merits and if you've seen some shows you'll get the references in the songs, all sung by characters in the show (except for Ziggy Marley doing the infectious theme song). ""Library Card"" includes the names of great books from your ownchildhood, like Hop on Pop and Where the Wild Things Are. Good booklet, too."
5,Gotta Love Arthur!,"We first discovered this CD at our local library and LOVED it. If you're an Arthur fan (and who isn't?), this is a must have. All the songs and storylines from your favorite show. Not a bad track on the CD (if you don't count ""Crazy Bus""). Buy it, you'll love it."
2,"Great for preschoolers and up, not of interest to toddlers","I wish I could take back the two stars I gave this CD 5 years ago and give it 4 instead. It's great for preschoolers and early grade schoolers. Mine quickly fell in love with the songs on the CD...they didn't find out for a year or two later that the songs were from a few actual Arthur episodes. You should have seen their jaws drop when those episodes came on!I wouldn't recommend this CD for really young children. They just won't get it. Instead, treat yourselves and your tiny children to a Tom Chapin CD or Choo Choo Boogaloo by Buckwheat Zydeco. That's more appropriate for the pre-preschool age bracket."
4,B movie heaven,"Grand double feature that bought back memories as a teen working at a drive-in theater (remember them?) Considering their budgets, both features are quite watchable and fun. Can't beat some of the old black and white sci-fi with some popcorn."
5,The Day the World Ended 1956,"After the Atomic destruction a hand full of people find them selves in a valley that escaped the initial radiation. Naturedly the mix is of innocent and not so innocent women and men. This is not just any valley it was especially picked by a survivalist that expected the big one to be dropped and scoped out a valley with lots of lead around them.Slowly encroaching on them is a strange mutant that has physic powers. Like the mutated monkeys on the atoll where they tested the bomb, this is probably the new generation of people replacements. Luckily he (it) still has a hankering for blonds in swimsuits.There is also the possibility of contaminated rain bringing radiation to the valley.One of the fun scenes in this Rodger Corman movie is when they throw a dummy off the cliff and you are supposed to believe it is a blond."
3,Great quality. Poor packaging.,"These are great quality sleeves at a really good Amazon price. The packaging is stupid, however. The sleeves are securely packed in a paper box but they are also bound by a thin rubber band that's so tight it creases the sleeves making about half a dozen in each package unusable. The paper box would have been more than sufficient."
4,What can I really say...,"Fast shipping, available with Prime. 100 sleeves for $6 you can't really beat that. Normal sleeves if you need them for storing discs, you can't go wrong."
3,A so-so sophomore attempt...,"I'm absolutely smitten with Seu Jorge, but I have to say was a little disappointed with this album, which seemed altogether darker and not as exciting as his previous attempt on ""Carolina"". While it does contain some gems, such as the English-language ""Don't"", I would not recommend this as a first Seu CD, try ""Carolina"" or even lookup his amazing work on the ""Life Aquatic"" soundtrack first, develop your taste for him and then try this album... I'd say buy it only if you're a hardcore Seu Jorge fan..."
5,WOW,"This guy summed it up perfectly.A strong contender for the sickest movie of all time, Ichi The Killer exhibits Miike Takashi's freewheeling visual imagination nonetheless. It's an ultraviolent revenge movie based on a Manga cartoon in which a sinister hypnotist manipulates the timid but unstable Ichi to dispatch various mobsters in horrifically violent fashion by invoking false memories of witnessing a rape. His ultimate target is a mutilated Yakuza played by the excellent Asano Tadanobu, sadistic and masochistic in equal measures, inciting boss and girlfriend to beat him savagely and exacting horribly inventive torture techniques on his enemies. At one stage, when he overdoes it and angers his bosses, he volunteers a ""sincere apology"" and cuts out his own tongue. He claims everyone is part sadist, part masochist and the director explores this theme with disturbing enthusiasm. This could do the job very nicely as the ""therapy"" film in A Clockwork Orange. [AK]--N A T F I L M F E S T I V A L"
2,ichi is a killer who has down syndrome,"First of all, the picture is not ichi, its some other wacko who actually is kinda cool unlike ichi who is aretarded twenty year old who is manipulated into killing gangsters and prostitutes by some other weirdo. This cat comes out with blades that come out of the heel of his special shoes. This definitly gets old. He cuts one guy in half which is about the only thing worth watching at all. All the killings just show blood being splattered around and you really don't get to see anything except the after math which is like a mortal kombat cheesy fatality. Stay away from this one. Your better off checking out dead alive."
2,blah,"Highly over rated and boring as Hell. About halfway through I just couldn't take it anymore and skipped to the final chapter. Even the climax of the film was boring. Yeah I get what the director was trying to do, but he failed. It was poorly executed and sadly will just sit on my dvd shelf for the rest of its life. That is unless I can unload it on a friend."
1,great cover...and a great coaster for drinks as well,"Eh...despite the hype about this director and the smashing style of lead villian Kakihara (the one on the cover), this has the air of some Tarantino wannabe with an extensive collection of crappy techno trying to make an ""edgy"" action movie. The gore is pretty extensive, but it's such cheesy CGI that you might as well be watching any random ultra-violent anime...most of the characters are either annoying (Ichi) or two-dimensional (pretty much everyone else) and the acting is straight out of college film class. I've heard great things about Visitor Q and Audition, but based on this they've moved from the middle of my ""buy"" list to the bottom of my ""rent"" list."
3,Apollo P-2250,"Printer worked fine and continues to print okay but will not print envelopes any more. Envelopes stop and difficult to remove. Very frustrating!Big problem is customer service, this is NONE.No tech support except under 90 day warranty. No phone numbers, no response to e-mails."
4,a good tune to listen to!,"i like it for the song, just to be clear about it!it's been a year after this song was released in 2000 and i like it now! why? cuase i never paid attention to this song until i got the karaoke VCD which featured this song inside and guess what? it was really nice to sing the song! it's touching cause u say someone makes u whole again, isn't it sweet? well, so far so good still, they need to polish up their vocal."
5,ATOMIC KITTEN RULE!,"This song is awesome, too bad Kerry left the group after it went to #1. It's great for the other members of the group: Liz, Natasha and Jenny. I wish them all the best and hope they get more #1's. Now on the tracklisting ratings:1. Whole Again Duh! This is the main track. It rocks! It's a lovely slow song about losing your boyfriend. 5/5 2. Holiday This song is upbeat, jumpy and makes you want to dance. Extra points added on for the funny talking bit in the middle 5/5 3. Whole Again (Remix) This is an ok remix, not my favourite remix. 4/5All in all, this single deserves 5 stars, it's tops! Now I wanna get Atomic Kitten's album...."
4,quite good,"this cd is fun. mixes of pop, club, mello and techno sounds. excellent for dance parties."
4,Good,I got my book very quickly with no tears or missing pages. So I was able to start reading it faster. It is a great book so far!
3,"Compelling History, Cumbersome Read","Lukacs has certainly zoomed in on a critical week in determining the course of World War II, and this work is no doubt an important academic contribution. I am glad I read it. That having been said, it was one of the longest 220 page books I've ever read, with all of the intriguing characters and developments of the week diluted in an ocean of the author's analysis, quotes from secondary sources and extreme textual footnoting. The result is a work of storytelling that doesn't live up to the story."
1,Don't do it!,"If you are considering this book for A.P Europoean History at M.H.S., don't do it. It is very tedious to finish, and the writing style is horrific.Also, if your name is Phil, don't do it."
2,Not all that impressed,"I tried using this keypad to play World of Warcraft, Dark Age of Camelot and Warhammer Online. I was not impressed. I had hoped that I would become accustomed to the layout but with the oddly shaped and placed keys (and some of the keys are very small) it was ever a battle trying to find my place on the keypad.Very well manufactured and sturdy. The key action was just like that of a conventional keyboard, just not a great layout and pattern for how like to play."
2,unresponsive,"while i tried using this product i found that the buttons are extremely unresponsive. the buttons will click down like a regular keyboard, but when it's clicked down, that doesn't mean that the button is being pushed, you then have to push it down a bit further than what you would expect. obviously this is a problem because when i'm playing games i can't focus on that, so if the button clicks down i assume that it's being pressed, but as stated before, this is not the case with the wolfking warrior.the button layout is great, the design is great and it seems like it has a very stable build. but since it has this issue i find the product to be unusable."
4,A great introductory text to algorithms,"I loved this book because it provided a great and simple introduction to algorithms. The text was well-written and extremely easy to follow. The companion slides that are up on the book website were also a good guide for our class. While the math is not as detailed as you might find in CLRS, I think it does a better job of walking students through many of the basic algorithms that would be useful to a typical developer. I also found the homework problems to be pretty interesting and useful. Overall, this is one of the better written CS textbooks out there and a must-have for someone who is approaching algorithms for the first time.Bilal Aijazi"
5,For KH Fans+Fanatics,"Anyone who is even slightly addicted to Kingdom Hearts will absolutely love this CD. You might feel a little hazy about buying it, seeing as most of the music is instrumental(save Simple and Clean's two versions - regular and remixed). But it is definitely an awesome buy! The second CD, I have to say, is a tad better, because the intense music from the game's final moments can be heard there. But CD 1 is definitely great as well, because it has the PLANITb Remix of Simple and Clean, Kingdom Hearts:Orchestra Instrumental, and Dearly Beloved, plus all the other music. It has EVERY song that is in the game; no song is left out. Even some short songs are displayed, like the 16 second song ""Miracle"". The CD is two disks with 76 songs, which runs for close to 2 1/2 hours. It is definitely worth the money, so any KH fan would love to own these CD's!"
4,Kingdom Hearts-The One and Only,"I think that this Cd is very cool. Utada Hikaru's voice is great, and since she sings Simple and Clean, it obviously sounds great, too! There are a lot of songs that are just the background music from the game, but some of them are really calming, like the ocean, and others are more intense, like a fight. I think this Cd is available at a great price and the songs are awesome, so don't miss out on buying it! If you buy this you won't regret it. I promise! Rachael M. :)"
5,Not sure if this is right...,"I bought the CD from Amazon.com, but I ended up getting japanese versions of Disk 1 #3 and Disk 2 #30. I'm satisfied listening to them the way Utada Hiraku originally sang Simple and Clean, but I was really hoping for the english version. Either way, it is the perfect item for any Square Enix or Disney fan. I highly recommend it!(P.S. If anyone knows how to get the english versions of the songs I mentioned, [...])"
5,Kingdom Hearts (SOUNDTRACK),"This is a fantastic CD, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the gaming world and its music!"
5,The Best Game on Earth,"I loved kingdom hearts .I though it was an exciting experience for the whole family. It was beautifully mastered together I found it very much enjoying . The sound track feels like a walk through this wonderful game and I love it ,and I reccomend it to all .It is an excellent experience . When I first played the game I fell in love with the beautifully put together graphics. The sound track feels like a taste of what It would be like to live within a video game.I dont know about you but that would be very exciting to me . So pick up the game + sound trackLove Reyna A.K.A Sora's Love & &-Good-Luck ..............Do you dare to take the challenge.."
2,Disturbing,"Although the acting was superb, I didn't like the suject matter. It was dark and very disturbing to me. I purchased this DVD because I am such a devote fan of Simon Baker, and he did a REALLY great job in his role. But I could not in all honesty recommend this film to anyone."
4,"Great performances, but a frustrating plot","Like other reviewers I got this from Amazon to see what Simon Baker can do with a character different from The Mentalist or The Guardian. Wow! Great job! Baker has a truly impressive range as an actor. The plot is pretty dark and compelling, but frustrating. I watched this about 4 times trying to figure out how the didn't-see-it-coming ending could result from what went before. No luck. It can't be done. It is not possible for the characters who did it to pull all the plot strings necessary to make the ending logical. That being said, get this DVD just for the enjoyment of watching Baker make the impossible seem entirely real. It's a great story, well presented, great location details, worth repeated watching. Just don't expect the ending to make sense."
2,Forget this one,"I really wanted to like this. I'm a big fan of Simon Baker, I think he's a fine actor, but if he keeps making movies like this, his movie career will go into freefall. How he can go from sublime TV like The Mentalist to this, only he knows.A story of a man whose daughter from a previous marriage is kidnapped. He and second wife go out to find her and so ensues dodgy religious stuff and lots of running around in the dark. The movie doesn't know whether it's a horror, thriller or is it just wasting our time. Go for the latter. There is zero chemistry between the two leads although you've got Benito Martinez from The Shield who is always worth watching.The sound quality on the DVD is atrocious and there are no subtitles."
4,Helpful... but not everything,"This book was very helpful to my RICA preparation, but in conjuction with the Ready for RICA book. If you're using both, the approaches are slightly different, like the difference between the Clifs and the Barron's prep books for the CSET. Each had some merit, neither would be a good idea to be the single source for preparation. My essay portion was helped, however, by studying from this book, as it's suggested answers were different from the Ready for RICA."
1,Truly a waste of time....,"I used this as my sole reference for my first (unsuccessful) RICA attempt, and I can only say that it was a waste of time and money. You'd be better off to spend the $$$ on a carryout dinner to enjoy while you surf the web looking for the best 5th year program sites. The content truly had nothing to do with the actual RICA."
5,Truly Wonderful Reading...,"Many thanks to Tim Ferris for bringing forth a concise, clear, unpretentious, and indeed magical notation of the advent and evolution of scientific thought in the Western world. This narrative, in it's lucid and practical treatment of ideas that oftentimes seem protected beneath a veil of academic elitism (ideas such as relativity, particle physics, and the like), is unsurpassed by any such writings in its genre. Many thanks again to Mr. Ferris in his efforts to bring us this book. I would recommend it to anyone who is involved in science to any degree. Whether a student of newly developing scientific curiosity, or a weathered professional, this book promises to open doors to yet unseen cognitive vistas, and blaze trails over yet unknown conceptual wildlands."
4,Just as expected,This product was just as I expected. My hermit crab has been eating the food. It does not have a bad fishy odor as some other hermit crab food does. It is also a good size and will last a while.
2,Entertaining,"I found this book outside a small bookshop while i was strolling the streets of Amsterdam. I was on my summer holidays from Ireland and was quite lost. Being an avid Follet reader i snatched it up immediately.Lets call a spade a spade. The book lacks depth, character development or any sign of tension. However, it was an entertaining read for a person who was travelling by train around Europe and was often stuck for english material. by Follets own admission the book didn't turn out the way he had planned. nobody would try to argue that this book is anywhere as good as 'pillars' but at the end of the day it is still a good entertaining read."
3,"I found it boring, the only book by Follette I could not get through","I am a big fan of Ken Follett, I read every single book he wrote. I was excited to find this book written early in his career, a book I have not read before. But I found it boring. It was the only book of his that I have not finished. Some day I might take in with me on vacation where I would be forced to finish it by not having any other options..."
1,Book Damaged My Life,"I read this book when I was 14, decades ago. This book damaged my life. The author made sexual sin out to be so dangerous that as a young boy I was afraid of what I might do. Instead of viewing the sexual part of life as something good that I should protect and cherish, I learned to fear the whole area."
4,You won't find this stuff anywhere else,This book was an eye opener! When I was in a difficult relationship a few years ago I was in counseling. I found this book and brought it in to my sessions My therapist purchased a copy because it clearly defines our emotional rights.The right to knowThe right to feelThe right to impactThe right to have spaceCrazymakers consistently violate these rights. And we may find we can be crazy makers to other. But there are ways we can stop hurting others and we can protect ourselves.Great stuffThe writing style feels very dated. But there are many good things in here
1,What a rip!,"This has got to be the WORST of the PPG DVDs I've seen yet! Nothing original, nothing new, and just plain boring. Why does everybody like this trash? All they do is use other songs from an old British band from the 60s and it's not ""Beat-Alls"" it's Beatles! They'd probably be rolling in their graves if they knew about this! It's NOT one bit funny whatsoever! I don't know what Craig was smoking when he made this and I really don't want to know."
2,Boycott this 3M/Scotch product! Too expensive,"I bought a roll of this and it worked adequately for the stated purpose, but I was in Korea recently and found out that American company Shurtape from NC produces a very similar product which performs even better, selling at Seoul's Office Depot stores for the equivalent of $0.65 for a 34 ft roll! How dare 3M/Scotch sell us a product (made in China, no less) for so much more than a higher quality export product made in the U.S.? Why is 3M charging Americans 8x more 70% less product than what the Koreans pay for a superior grade export American product? The nerve!"
2,Basically all this is is double-sided tape.,"Basically, all this is is double-sided tape except it's wider and not as sticky. It says it will hold posters/decorations under one pound. I used it to hang a thin, 7oz metal sign of Shakespeare that says ""Will Power"". I covered the back with it top, bottom and center. It fell off the wall 3 times and after the final time, it bent the sign when it fell.No, I do not recommend this and will never buy it again. I gave it a try and it totally disappointed me."
1,Doesn't stick,"I would give it 0 stars if I could. I followed the instructions and wanted to tape up lightweight cardstock, about 7x10 in a page. The weight isn't the problem, though the tape should be able to hold such a small amount of weight. It just does not stick to the wall. I pressed down hard and it keeps coming up and the Alphabet Cards falling off the wall. Very irritating after I spent time spacing out the alphabet cards perfectly and arranging it just right, just to find 1/2 of them on the floor the next morning."
2,Doesn't hold much or for long,"I recently bought the Scotch tape to put up 5x7 pictures on the wall of a workout room. My daughter asked me to put up her ""One Direction"" poster. I tried using it and it did not hold for very long at all. I was highly disappointed with it. It is not nearly as sticky as other mounting strips I used, which were much stronger."
2,Decent enough if you use enough tape,"This is double-sided tape that's just sticky enough to put very lightweight posters on the wall without adhering so tightly that it damages the wall. It seems to hold up just fine and it hasn't marred any of my walls. The tape is not re-useable though. Once I take it off a poster, which doesn't damage the poster either, the tape usually sticks to itself as it curls up.However, given anything with heft, such as a laminated poster, won't work out. It may seem like it is going to work, but gravity is eventually going to win. That might be fine in the privacy of your room, but it would be very distracting in the middle of a presentation or meeting.I tried this product because I got it free through Amazon Vine. I wouldn't pay for it though."
3,"not wonderful, but not horrible","There isn't a lot that I can add to my review that hasn't been said in all of the others.Read the package - including, or especially - the small print. This double-sided tape isn't meant for heavy duty use and is best for temporary projects that you don't need hung for long periods of time. The tape doesn't remove from the objects being hung easily - most people are more worried about the permanent surface, but there are two involved, and both can be damaged.If you need something for heavier objects, I would look at some of 3M's other products - the same goes for more surface-friendly hanging products - make sure you read the small print to find exactly what you need - this one doesn't work with wall paper or flat paint.It isn't a bad product, if you stop to read what it is you are buying."
4,Great for holding light stuff!,"3M Wallsaver Removable Mounting Tape comes in a regular tape dispenser, which I really like. It will hold very light stuff on the walls without pulling the paint off. I agree with other poster who said it would be the best solution for apartment dwellers who want to hang light things without worrying about ruining the walls. It's very convenient and easy to use."
5,Excellent product...,"This two-sided tape is so easy to work with and use. I have used it already to hang up several items, and they are staying up strong. Great stuff! Gentle on paint and walls. Super strong, easy to manage..."
1,Buy A Bottle Of Cheap Wine Instead,"Buy a bottle of cheap wine instead of wasting money on this awful offering. I've never heard of TGG Direct and I now see why. This trio of old school Black films looks like they all came from videotapes. Honestly, I only glanced at Brotherhood Of Death and Children Of The Night. I was very upset after seeing the horrible transfer of Candy Tangerine Man (the reason I bought this rip-off) which looks worse than a Ebay copy I purchased years ago. I was hoping I would finally get to see a remastered print of one of my favorite trashy Blaxsploitation films. This looks like it was copied off my copy. TGG may be short for Tommy Gordon's Grimy VHS Collection. Please, just stay away from this Urban CON-nection."
5,Fits great!,Use it all the time everywhere. Would recommend to friends and family when ever I get the chance to see them.
5,"cook better, control wok, save energy","Before I got this ring, I heated wok directly on big electric burner. It was power-hungry but slow to raise or drop heat, so food would burn or soak. With this ring, narrow side down, I heat wok on small fast electric burner. It is power-frugal, heat raises and drops quickly, and food cooks as it would on gas burner. All coils are covered, so all energy is used. Ring fits outside coils perfectly. Flat-bottom wok sits close enough to absorb all heat. Gap dissipates heat all over wok, so food does not burn. Gap is small, so flat bottom and flat coils bump and limit wok movement as I stir-fry."
3,Down With Assorted Colors!,"These fit me very well, but I just want them in black. Why doesn't Hanes offer these in just one color? I had to buy a pack with 3 white and 3 black to get the black ones I wanted, but I won't do that again. I think I'll switch to Jockey who lets you chose the colors you want -- and they sell a pack of just black!Sorry Hanes. I liked your price. I liked your fit. But I don't like your assorted colors!"
2,Upset Not As What Is Described,"I ordered these because i personaly like hanes underware for what i need for basic training (i leave soon), and needed a bunch in black color, There advertisement clearly stated you would get 3 blacks and 3 whites in colors. I only got 1 black underware in each of the 3 packages i recieved and a bunch of pink, and ones with designs on them."
3,pre-historic,"For those of who the word new-age music (this after all was released on Narada) conjures images of soothing chimes, fluttering bird songs and down right muzak (including your's truly), this fortunately does not come anywhere close to it. True to the subject, Peter Melnick delivers appropriate pre-historic themes that weave dark mellow sonics to live ambient sounds. I have not seen the series, so can not comment on how well this actually gels running in the background to 'narrate' the scenes, but the very fact that this recording can stand on its own owes much to the delivery of the musicians (see list below) as to music and arrangments composed by Melnic for the 4 part PBS series on a captivatinh era gone by.Musicians: Brad Dutz (Percussion); Peter Melnick (Synthesizer, Piano); George Doering (Guitar); Dave Stone (Fretless Bass); John Yoakum (Clarinet, Flute, Alto, Soprano Sax, English Horn, Oboe); Bruce Martin (Didjeridu)"
3,durability,"I was initially very satisfied with this product, however, within a few weeks the clip cracked and the pin is not staying in place. The durability of this phone clip is not what I expected. I would not have expected this from a rubberized clip."
5,Great Movie in a Great Series,Another Disney great. My two year old loves Tinkerbell and this is a great story and fun movie to watch. Even my 6 year old boy likes to watch this one.
3,Good but not quite magical,"While overall the movie is suitable for all ages it lacked the magic of Disney. The voice acting was very good and of course Disney has superb animation, but the story line was a little weak. It just wasn't as good as the the first two Tinker Bell movies. Good enough to buy? Yes, I suppose so, but I can't give a high recommendation."
5,Excellent little girls movie!,This product came quickly and was just what my neice wanted. The movie was so cute and she loved it!
4,Really cute movie!,"I watched this movie with my 11 year old son, (whom I would expect would hate a fairy movie) and we both loved it! This is my favorite of the first 3 Tinker Bell movies by far."
2,"It works well enough, though not thrilled with quality of fixtures","It installed simply and works perfectly well, but the metal mounting brackets were so thin and flimsy that they nearly bent in half when I installed them requiring me to go to the hardware store and get some small metal plates to put behind them to hold them in place in order for the outlet to stay securely. Aside from that, it does work well and was cheap enough that it served my purposes."
4,"Flaws are in words, not music","The music is all good, even if 'Trail of Tears' and 'Chosen Voices' sort of run together. It's just often completely disconnected from the titles, even more so from the programme story, which doesn't key to all the selections or at least not in the proper order. The skippity-bop beat of 'Trail of Tears' doesn't even suit a 'Trail of Pouting'; to attach it to a phrase of so much death and loss as the Trail of Tears of the Cherokee Removal seems utterly ignorant and disrespectful. The phrase isn't entirely pulled out of the air: the cut has a distinct Native American ambiance. Absolutely the weakest Arkenstone album I've heard, which means still miles ahead of most, and the only one in which I've heard him flirt with Middle Eastern themes."
4,"This one and ""In the Wake of the Wind"" are his best.","This is pretty much a flawless album from David Arkenstone. He can do no wrong on any of the releases I have from him. A true professional musician with a great musical vision. He always incorporates different musical elements in his music. Always something new album to album. If you're new to David Arkenstone, get this one and ""In the Wake of the Wind."" Worth a listen."
4,The Best of the Best!,"I was looking at tons and tons of games on amazon.com. I liked so many of them, that I wanted to buy them all. For Christmas I received a amazon.com gift card, with $20. So my buying was limited. I saw this and wondered, is this really true? It was all 4 games I wanted, ALL IN 1! (package that is) lol!Rollercoaster Tycoon is the best, I find it totally adicting! all of the other games are much fun too!Oh... and if your wondering the only reason I gave it only 4 stars for fun and overall, thats because nothing's perfect the only perfect one is Jesus our Lord and Savoir.Happy New Year!"
3,Excellent Story Teller & Read--some editorial problems,"Mr. Adams is an excellent story teller and I own a few of his books. They are well worth the money; the only caveat is that the small amount of letting and nearly non-existent margins makes his books hard to read--other than that, they are excellent."
1,Poorly packaged,"The product would have been fine but I received the compressor upside down. I believe the flimsy box it was packaged in was the main problem. Also the product is to heavy for normal delivery and it just gets thrown around by ups. I had to return my item because the gages were all broken. The motor mount was bent down, cooling fins on the head were broke and it was all beat up. I returned it and bought a quincy."
1,Damaged in shipping,I sent this item back for a refund due to shipping. I would not order another one because I am certain the shipping will not be any better.Flimsy box without any protection.
5,Great air producer,"I would highly recommend this product to anyone with a woodworking shop.After searching the internet for a compressor, I found that Amazon had the best quality compressor for the lowest price. Thanks Amazon.Campbell Hausfeld VT6290 15 Amp 2 Horsepower 20 Gallon Oiled Wheeled Single Tank Compressor"
1,A big miss,"I am a big fan of almost all the books Gallup and their people have put out. This book was a total miss. The humor was painful, and the management lessons were forced onto a weak story.I read the reviews of this book, and thought - it can't be that bad - but, they were right - this was pretty weak. I do not give out many 1 star reviews, but this book actually deserves it. If anything this book is mildly entertaining, but could have been half as long. Better luck next time....JVD"
4,Animals review....,"Here is a story that has been used by The Gallup Organizations' (the polling company) clients for over thirty years, and has just been released on audio. This tale introduces you to a group of metaphorical barnyard animals trying to run a successful business. Once they decide that education is the key to success, the members of Animals, Inc. set up training classes. The various animals work hard to overcome their natural shortcomings. The workhorse tries to operate the computer; the shy sheep makes sales calls, etc. Get ready for some unpredictable and funny results."
4,Almost Five stars...,"I thought that the basic characters in research psychology got a decent biography, but the history of psychoTHERAPY was given short shrift. A good reference.There's a lot at the beginning about pre-psychology philosophy, including our friends Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and many of the Renaissance thinkers as well as Enlightenment philosophers.Interesting, but I'm not sure that I fully absorbed much of the material."
2,plain jane,"I was excited to read this based on the reviews, but after four chapters, I had to abandon it. I admit that isn't much time, but if the story doesn't grab me after that long into it, I can't see wasting any more time. The characters were ""blah"" - not much to like even in Miriam to keep me interested in her. And, when Paul's parents find out that he has died and fly out to her house, they don't seem to concole her at all or even be emotionally connected to her in any way - they just seem to tolerate her and the reason for this is never explained...I couldn't give the book more time to reveal it to me. I kept thinking ""big deal"" page after page....nothing was really extraordinary: characters, events, or writing style. Sorry...I don't get the awesome reviews."
1,Does not merit treading,"I read the entire book and agree w/ ""plain jane' review. This book goes nowhere and am amazed that anyone gave it 5 stars! Nothing, absolutely nothing gets resolved. Thre are more major issues(death, secret lives, homosexulaity, abortion, borken family relationships) in this book than is needed and none are fully developed. Too bad. Best thing about the book is the title."
5,Excellent Review and Exploration,"Cozolino's text presents a very complicated topic in an extremely accessible manner, owing to a straightforward writing style and a penchant for perfectly applicable example case studies. He breaks down the functioning of the brain into ""digestible"" chunks and builds throughout the text on earlier learning. If you work in the field of counseling or psychotherapy, you simply cannot go wrong by reading this book and supplementing your knowledge of neuroscience-psychotherapy connection."
4,awkward,A christmas present for my daughter. she will love it.this is one of her new favorite shows to watch.
4,Not the greates Living Colour album but definitely worth it,"If you like Living Colour this is a must have. If only for the two live versions of ""Memories Can't Wait"" and ""Desperate People"" these two show what a furious live act this band was. If you were lucky enough to see these guys live, these two songs alone justify buying this album"
2,Body shop experience recommended...,"The first one I received was beat up to the point it was not able to be fixed. I returned it (Amazon took very good care of me here). The next one arrived beat up as well but in much better shape. A few hours with a hammer & dolly, sandpaper and some touch up paint and it's exceptable. I would have returned the second one as well but I was afraid of what might arrive next. In both cases the packaging was a mess. It was obvious that both of these lathe stands had been returned to someone before. If the product is not ""As New"" then the ad should say so."
5,No Problem--Makes Labels,"Having read all the reviews on the P-touch 1500PC I was almost afraid to buy it. In spite of that, once I cut through the plastic armor it came packaged in there were zero problems. I use a Mac with OS X 10.3.8. The software and drivers installed effortlessly. the applications are very professionally done--almost gltizy cool. Moreover, they work first time right out of the box. In less than 10 min I was making plain labels. I have only tried the sample tape but it does what I bought this for. I have played with the software and while I can't be sure that fancy labels will print, they are easy to make and look good on the screen. I give the software a 5 and the machine a 5 for simplicity and ease of use."
1,This story is flat and unimaginative.,JAK's continued overuse of new-age thinking cannot disguise the fact that this story was dull and the characters were not developed to their full potential. I agree with some of the other reviews. Either come up with some new ideas or take a break from writing. No reader should ever have to force themselves to finish a book by an author that they usually enjoy.
1,I usually love her books but this one was the same old story,"J.A.K.'s stories are usually a quick enjoyable read. They get to the point and the main characters are usually fun interesting people with great more than one dimentional PERSONALTIES! Not these! The story was boring, new age was boring, the scenery was boring, and the romance was boring (which was unforgivable). The only good part was that I would never have figured out who did the dirty deed .... probaly because the characters were not very well developed. I felt that she got an old plot and changed the location and the characters names but left out the good stuff. I was disappointed and will wait to buy her next book in paperback (if I buy it at all) instead of buying another J.A.K.s hard cover just because I love J.A.K."
2,A disappointment for a huge Krentz fan,"I have always loved JAK's novels, but this one and her most recent Flash were both disppointments. The characters were not developed and the plot ludicrous. Here's hoping she can go back to the way she used to write (Sharp Edges is one of my favorites.)"
2,big anticipation bigger disappointment,"I should just say ""ditto"" to the other poor reviews of this book. The characters were flat and the snappy dialogue was definitely missing, My copy of the book was donated to the library without a backward glance. I had even read the reviews before I bought the book so shame on me......I guess I was just a doubting Thomas....that will teach me!"
3,"Please no more ""New Age""......","I've read JK since her earliest writing days and have always loved her stuff. Growing up in Vancouver it was always great to read someone who set her books in the area of the world I knew and loved. But if I see one more ""new age"" or ""metaphysical"" relationship storyline then it will be too soon. This is definately not her best work and after re-reading some of her latest work I have to confess that I think that they're all starting to sound the same. Couldn't get into these characters at all and despite a promising beginning, no mystery to this mystery.A return to the writing style of her earlier books would be appreciated."
3,Not Quite 5 Star Krentz,"I LOVE Jayne Anne Krentz's books...but this one was not quite on the mark. It was abrupt, as if it were an outline or maybe a movie script proposal. There was no sassy humor. The main characters were good but there were so many secondary characters flashing in and out and without full development that I lost track of who was who. Maybe Jayne should get a new editor who lets her do what she does well, spin a sensual tale of suspense with full character development."
2,I hope JAK does a better job in her new book!!,"JAK used to do this kind of romance very well. She had the very strong male lead, strong female counter-part who may be antagnostic towards one another, but have great physical chemistry; a crisis which can involve either of their respective families, work/careers or both; and a mystery that must be solved. In the Eye of the Beholder, all the ingredients are there, but JAK missed the mark. I haven't given up on her work yet and will be willing to give her next book a try. Her old books which I have been collecting through Amazon.auctions rarely disappoint."
3,An acceptable introduction to the field,"Likely to market a larger audience, this book presents an overview - and only an overview - of modern advances in artificial life. (It does contain good suggestions for further reading however.) Dr. Sipper always makes for interesting and entertaining reading but those looking for more technical details might consider his earlier effort, the highly recommended ""Evolution of Parallel Cellular Machines."""
2,Eye Candy,"This book has great photographs and nice glossy pages, but the information is a little suspect. It gives the impression by more educated Masonic scholars that little research was conducted."
4,It's great to see the personalities behind the games.,"This is a fun book. I'm surprised it hasn't gotten more attention. There are 9 grandmasters interviewed, including Yasser Seirawan, and Sofia Polgar. I particularly appreciated Sofia's comments on Blitz chess, since I sometimes have trouble convincing my friends that they can actually improve in some ways by playing fast games.Each master annotates (proudly but lightly) a victory of his own, and one of his historical favorites. I'm not sure it's worth the money, but it's certainly worth your time."
5,"Well researched, balanced, resource on hermeneutics.","Virkler does an excellent job of presenting facts and theories, yet at the same time presents varying historical views of each sujbect. Some may object to the inclusion of alternative viewpoints on some subjects but I found this helpful in understanding how different people came up with their particular opinions. I found the research to be sound and extensive."
2,Kid frendly?,"I found this program to move too slowly to hold my kids (ages 5, 9 & 13) interest and the educational content was not adequate to hold mine. The photography on the other hand was stunning. May be better for background viewing with the sound off. It would be of great benefit to those who are skeptical or unaware of man's impact on Earth unfortunately, they aren't the likely audience."
3,Mute button on standby,"If you are the type of person that doesn't like to be lectured, avoid this video.While the photography was quite good, the non-stop enviro-badgering had me turning offthe T.V. half way through. I learned that we should protect the environment from thetype of people that would waste precious natural resources making this show....Update, watched it again and it's not as bad the second time. Very good panoramic shots.I guess I'm still bothered that there were parts of the narration that warned about overpopulation.Yes, it's a problem but exactly what can I do about it? I suppose that lectures about issues beyond my controlreally are annoying."
5,Must see,"Awesome film. ""Inconvenient truth"" film by Al Gore was for the mind. This film is for the feeling. This is the feeling, sensate, version of the same film, putting in dazzling images the data most of us are aware off by now, and, in this way, it goes much deeper. The images are so stunning, they leave you mesmerized. In fact they have a haunting quality. But the film 's intent is not to leave us in a daze, it is more to motivate us into action and wake us up from our sleep. I recommend this film wholeheartedly."
4,Worth it for the visuals alone,My first review was 2 stars. After giving this another shot I was happy with the visuals some of which are absolutely incredible. It's not Planet Earth or Life but this is solid none the less. It is a bit preachy at the end and the narration is not my favorite but the visuals in HD on a huge screen are spectacular.
1,A Frighteningly Superficial Book.,"This book at first wins you over for its apparent ambition.Then you realize that the cost of this ambitiously wide focus is its incredbily spotty and poorly substantiated generalizations.Its comments on the 1960s and in particular Vietnam policy are made with all the subtly and insight of Operation Rolling Thunder. More importatnly they very very often just plain wrong. I found myself shaking my head and reattatching my jaw several times while reading these sections.The international comarisons are meant to seem oxymoronic and countercyclically brillient. Then you step back and realize that these generalizations are so basic and vague as to seem not even worthy of a single sentence. I am truly frightened that this book is apparently so highly reguarded by todays historians. Then again, it seems appropriate for our current period of post-modern stalinism, in which the appearance of choices disguises the homogeneity of the Goldman Sachs mind."
1,Left-wing drivel,"Apparently Suri's idea of bold, risk-taking history is to serve up cold the revisionist history of the past few decades. America is bad; the rest of the world is good. How tiring. Avoid books by Jeremi Suri like the plague."
2,Not authentic team hat,"Why is it so hard to get a Detroit Tigers cap? Either the color is wrong, or (in this case) the English D is too large. I know it does not look that way in the picture, but it is. Also, it does not fit properly. I would recommend this hat for girls or those with long hair, but not for men with short hair... it simply won't fit."
2,Sports bra runs small & straps are too short,"Yikes this sports bra runs small on all dimensions! I could barely get the 32A over my head. The cups are smaller than most A cups but the worst thing is the straps are way TOO short so you can't convert into the racer back style as advertised. The flexi band/wire is also sort of odd and not that flexible. If you're smaller chested and trying to decide between the Pure Lime Push Up bra and the Bendon Sport Flex Out, I'd recommend the Pure Lime Push Up bra, which is fantastic."
4,Just the ticket,"At a previous employer, I've had the chance to use a monster vertical saw, and a Grizzly horizontal saw with hydraulic feed control. In setting up my home shop, space and budget dictated that I would need a saw that worked both horizontally and vertically. This Jet saw works fine for my needs, which so far is just cutting 6061 aluminum. You'll need to take care when cutting horizontally, controlling speed of descent, or you'll be overloading it and losing teeth out of your blade.Vertical cutting is fine as well, although the stamped metal ""table"" is a bit of a joke. (A stamped miter slot - who are we kidding here?) I expect that I'll replace it with a larger table made from birch veneer plywood. THEN I can include a functional miter fence.All in all, a fine value for the price."
3,It will work for small thin rugs.,"Its not a bad product, but it could be better. It's not very strong and does not work well on thick rugs regardless of the area size. It's good for floor mats, small area rugs, runners, maybe ever hard floors, but not for room carpeting."
3,Swift Stick,"The swift stick picks up okay on wood & tile floors ok, but does not do well with pet hair. For the price it is good for quick pick up of crumbs."
1,Horrible suction.,I wound up giving these away. I should have thrown them away instead. Hopefully the company has redesigned these units to have more suction.
5,The stuff is magic,"This tape is the one and only. It is easy to remove, but stays in place while you want it there. It is well worth the premium."
5,Great High Strength Double Sided Mounting Tape,"This tape is great for hardware projects requiring a high strength but potentially temporary bond. I have often used it for building mechanical and electrical gadgets as well as for repairs on household items. It has worked well on both flat and irregular surfaces. I would highly recommend the Scotch exterior mounting tape over the foam-based tapes for any project -- indoor or outside as it holds up better under repeated mechanical stress.In one example, I used this tape to affix several one pound lead weights to flight simulator rudder pedals that were ultimately removed. The removal was an arduous process. I found that using a Weller heat gun and hand scraper was the best method. If you are using this mounting tape in situation where it may need to be removed, you might was to check the durability of the surface first as any paint/finish could be damaged."
5,Did the job,I needed tape for my gun sight to stay on my shotgun. This did the job. Doesn't fall off with the recoil from shooting.
2,It's not sticking very well,It's the type of tape I need but it is not sticking very well. It continues to lift and the stickyness is not very sticky. I would like to have it replaced but it appears that I'm being required to pay for shipping it back and to do that will cost more than what the tape cost.
5,Versatile tape,"This is a great, versatile tape that can be used for many jobs around the house, as long as you aren't being unrealistic. I used this to reattach my exterior car door trim that peeled off, and it has held well for a few months already. I park the car outside in the sun and rain."
5,Bissell Quick steamer,I love this one...Its so easy to use!!!!!! Even my 6 year old helps me LOL....I would tell all my friends about this one ..
2,"No vibrating or spinning brush, get ready for a workout","(You'll have to) Put your back into it ...Hey all. First, don't buy this as a replacement for renting a carpet cleaner from your local Albertsons, it's simply not up to that kind of job. It the kind of cleaner which is really small, so fits in a closet for a quick spill clean up .... but not much beyond that unless you are really going to put your back into it.It is simply not practical to use this to clean a whole room, much less a whole house. You'd be better off paying the extra $65 for a larger carpet cleaner."
4,Quite Enjoyable,"A very engaging book of four short stories, two of which are fairy tale retellings and two of which are original. Robin's usual compelling style draws us in and makes us care about the characters, the reading isn't too difficult, and she accomplishes quite a remarkable feat in the fourth story: she manages to tell the whole wonderful thing without naming a single character."
5,Beautiful!,"Beautiful book! It contains all of the stories of hers that I was told a child.Many people forget Jemina Puddle Duck and Johnny Townmouse are also characters in her stories besides Peter Rabbit.The book is filled with beautiful pictures, making a perfect gift or the perfect book to curl up and reminisce with."
4,Perfect christening present!,Actually bought this my own son but perfect for Christening present.Lovely well made hard back should last a lifetime.Stunning Potter picture and classic tales a real treat for a child and the adult reading!
3,Printed in China,3 Star rating for it's printed in China and has a musty smell. Over all it seems like a nice book. Our daughter loves it. Have to find a way to air it out now.
2,Charming but.. disturbing?!,"I was disappointed with such tales as 'Tale of Pigling Bland' and 'Tale of Samuel Whiskers'. Whether to read the story, or even worse, the video(s), it is disturbing for a young one. In the first story mentioned, a man captures Pigling Bland, and at one point ominously hovers over him, and pokes him, and says 'its not time in the season for curing bacon.' Then in the latter story, it depicts a kitten being captured by rats, who wrap him in twine, and then wrap him in dough, all the while the kitten is mewing and writhing to get away. I really can't let my 2 1/2 year old watch this stuff! I am soooo disappointed. Such charming artwork and imagery!! I didn't know the Beatrix Potter stories had such a dark side."
2,Lovely pictures disguise worrisome & troubling tales,"The lovely illustrations in these stories disguise the sad, troubling, and worrisome content, which I do not think is appropriate for young children. Corporal punishment, threats to safety, and parental disapproval are all too common and real themes in the lives of some children. Dressing it up with beautiful illustrations and artful storytelling doesn't take the sting and concern about of the stories themselves. I find the stories disturbing, and so did my child at age three. I have put these stories away -- there are so many better books that give children positive messages, not fearful ones."
5,When they are getting too old for picture books (living book),"When your child is getting too old for picture books, but hasn't quite the patience for chapter books, these stories are absolutely brilliant for this in-between stage.With such beautiful pictures, supurb narrative and intriguing ideas, it's little wonder my 4 and 7 year old girls are captivated by these stories."
3,Some songs ok,"Done of the songs are good, but several I don't even remember from the film. Good buy. I listen to it when I clean the house"
2,Deep in the sea...,"Truthfully, I thought it'd be better. It was only a scuba-dude goiing down for fish! I mean what's up with that?"
2,"High level summary, not much content","This article includes a very high level summary of what Six Sigma is and let's you know Sun Chemical is implementing it across various business functions. If you're looking for any details on Six Sigma Implementation in the Chemical industry, this is not the article."
3,Go with the Foam,"I value my Fluval filter because it does such a great job, but the foam inserts seem to do a better job. In addition, the foam can be re-used after cleaning."
5,Great Little Sample Book,"Has gobs of their most useful filters. great to use to determine your filter needs. Shipping reasonable from vendor, do not believe other posts with complaints regarding shipping charges. They must have mistakenly ordered air rush options. No complaints from me. Just choose the best shipping option for you."
5,Awesome,"Best season yet! And don't forget the Peacekeeper Wars, you will want to see for sure! Ordering from Amazon is always a pleasure, cheap prices, fast delivery, and courteous sellers."
3,Not enough support,"Cons:Seems thin and is somewhat flat in wrong way (horizontally) like a pillow.Gets dirty soon and not available in any diffent colors.Pro:For a memory foam pillow pricing is good.If you have a small neck, small built, this could be good one.Material is of good quality."
2,Soft but head not supported because of flatness.,"It's soft but not thick enough to support my head. It's very flat and therefore your head has to tweak to the side to be supported, which defeats the purpose of the neck pillow. I wouldn't know any difference if I didn't just return a previous pillow at Target for this one (because this one got raving reviews). I think I'm going to go back to Target and re-buy my previous purchase."
2,GARBAGE,"I honestly dont know what people are ranting and raving about but this thing is utterly useless.You are better off folding an airline blanket (which I just did) than using this partially filled, low quality-visceolastic filled pillow.Not nearly thick enough to prevent your head from rolling and honestly it feels like its filled with bunched up cheap foam as opossed to visc-memory foam.Save your money and buy something abit higher quality. I just tossed mine in the garbage."
3,"alright, but I returned it","This was a nicely made u-shaped pillow, but the cover was not as soft as I had hoped. Also, it is a relatively ""flat"" pillow that does not give much support when you fall asleep and your head rests on your shoulder. It would work in a pinch, but there are better products out there for my purposes: airplane travel in economy..."
4,good product,"I am satisfied with this product. I travel a lot so it's a good thing for me. I am sure there're better products out there, but for the price I paid, I would say it's worth it."
1,cheap pillow from china that does not act like memory foam,"The pillow is not at all ""therapeutic"". If one has need of such a pillow, this one won't do it. It is hard and has no give."
5,FRASIER - Complete series,OUTSTANDING collection......sat down and watched the entire series with little interuptions. My favorite sit-com. Too bad it took so long for the last (10th??) season to be released and then for the entire series to be sold as a package deal. We love it and will be re-watching it again soon. Thank you for your service and support.
2,Fraiser DVD's,"I ordered this set of DVD's and the seller was prompt at deliverying them. However, the DVD's will not play on any of my 3 my DVD players. When I try to play them, I get the Disc Error: playback feature may not have been activated on this disc. There are 11 boxes to this set = 44 DVD's total. I get this error on all of the DVD's except 1 or 2 of the DVD's. When I brought this to the attention of the seller they were kind enough to send me a new set of DVD's right away. Sadly, I have the same problems with the new set of DVD's. I did find out that these DVD's will play on my computer, but 1 out of 3 DVD's in the 11 boxes give me the same Disc error: playback feature may not have been activated on this disc. Needless to say, I am not happy with this purchase. I paid good money for this DVD set and I expect to get good quality merchandise. I think the seller should get a new distributor for his products. Maybe that would help."
3,Should have bought the complete wok,"I bought the lid separately for my 14"" wok and I was sorry I did not buy a complete wok (i.e. wok, fire ring and lid together). The lid I purchased sits lower in the wok than I would have liked, but quality wise the lid is good."
1,Terrible Book.,"Okay. This book is cheap which is nice. BUT it is NOT HELPFUL. Even for someone with a background in logic this book is worthless, but especially for a beginner. There are hardly any practice problems, the explanations are terrible, and for the few problems in the book there are not any answers. So, it is very difficult to use this book and know what (if anything) you are doing right or doing wrong."
4,No increasing complexity,I found the book to be entertaining. The observation that only local adaptations drive the organisms is important. In particular it is troublesome that there doesn't seem to be trend towards increasing complexity in biological systems. Like other readers I did find the book a bit too long and belabored.
2,"Major-league ego, Mr Gould?","This book might be interesting reading, if it were not for thefact that the reader is left in no doubt that Gould has an extremelyhigh opinion of himself; to an extent that is irritating to saythe least. A representative example from page 106-107: ""...Severalyears later I redid the study... (3 weeks at the computer formy research assistant...)... . ...pardon a bit of crowing, butI was stunned and delighted by the elegance and clarity of thisresult.""Note that the learned Prof. Gould has the same attitude tohis ""research assistant"" as to any other tool in his work, somethingto be used and that shall remain nameless, despite the ""elegance and clarity of HISresult"".Most of Gould's previous books have been collections of short essays.I hope he returns to that format on his next efforts. Such a monumentalego is digestible only in small doses..."
5,The Great Novel of Australia's Formation,"This epic follows the fortunes of Richard Mahony from his days as store-owner on the 1854 Ballarat Gold Fields to his prosperous career as a rich and famous doctor to his gradual mental disintegration and death. The background of the Australian gold rushes, which turned Australia from a colonial outpost into a prosperous industrial society, is never allowed to take centre stage from what is essentially a study of Mahony's personal life: We see his essential character flaws move from eccentricity to eventual mental disintegration. But the background interactions are essential reading for anyone who would understand the Australian nation."
3,Cry Of A Tiny Babe,"Cry Of A Tiny Babe is a great modern day Christmas song except it is marred by these lines written by Bruce: Joseph comes to Mary with his hat in his hand, Says ""forgive me I thought you'd been with some other man"", She says ""what if I had been - but I wasn't anyway and guess what I felt the baby kick today"". Here Bruce rewrites history by turning a chaste young woman in a culture that highly values sexual purity into a contemporary teenager with no scruples. Bruce - just because you can't keep your Canadian bacon in your pants don't try to justify immorality."
4,"""Cry of a Tiny Babe"" the beautiful chorus moved me to tears.","The best song is ""Cry of a Tiny Babe"".CHORUS:Like a stone on the surface of a still river, Driving the ripples on forever, Redemption rips through the surface of time, In the cry of a tiny babeThe chorus moves me in a way that only poetry can. The chorus communicates to me the concept of redemption in a way that haunts me and fills me a sense of wonder. Although I am not a devout christian, the message of Jesus in the chorus is very moving.This is one of my favorite discs."
3,"Good, but not super strong","I purchased this tape to mount some very tiny speakers to the bottom of my flat screen tv. The speakers may weigh a couple ounces each, but after a few days they fell right off. Not to say the tape isn't great, but it has it's limitations and doesn't create that permanent bond with metal or plastic. For less weight bearing tasks it does a good job."
1,Worst Kids Video Ever!!!! Don't Buy This!,"Zero stars for this horrible production. The kids are crawling around randomly with scary looking makeup on their faces (looks like they did the makeup themselves!). Random videos of animals and strange looking kids running around the park with even weirder looking adults with them. It looks like someone's home videos at a birthday party or something. They use the same few costumes in every single song. I would say there was little to no planning, just show up in some random costume and run around acting silly. Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra for the Baby Einstein or even Baby Genius videos. Those are a million times better. Even the quality of the songs is extremely bad on this dvd. My son barely paid attention to it the one and only time I played it for him. DON'T BUY THIS!!!"
4,This book needs a reprint!,"Ted Stewart's Solving the Exodus Mystery is outstanding other than the small pictures and no index. When Ted's second book comes out many will find he will reference Charles Forster's Sinai Photographed as this was the first book to show the Hebrew writing on the rocks in the Sinai and translates the writing, which in turn gives us the name of the Pharaoh of the Exodus (Amenemhet IV). Ted did an outstanding job putting together all the imformation and pointing out the connections to the dates of each of the Pharaohs' reigns.Ted didn't have the backing to do a the art work of Roth's Pharaohs and Kings or Moller's The Exodus Case, but of the three Ted's is the most important and should be reprinted with more care to photographs and a better editor."
5,The Ultimate Non-Shakespeare Bible,"Tired of all the ""Thees"" and Thous?"" Get this Bible. Eugene Peterson has done a masterful job of translating God's Word into something that can be read and enjoyed. (It's about time) It's a fun read...very dramatic and creative without ruining the integrity of the timeless truths of God. To those who say, ""The King James Version is the official version of the Bible sanctioned by God,"" I say, ""Phooey!"" God's Word is meant to be understood and ""The Message"" does that. (Besides, Jesus never said ""Thee"" or ""Thou."" Ever.)"
3,The Message:,"I was shocked when it arrived because it is NOT the Bible in cont. lang. it is the New Testament, Psalms, and Proverbs. It should be advertised as such. I have enjoyed reading it, but really wanted to study a specific passage in Isaiah."
2,"Easy to read, but hard to understand","Sure, the language is contemporary and nuanced. Yes, Peterson writes in a style fairly close to typical American speech patterns. But over and over as I read through The Message, I kept thinking how difficult it was to understand points that should be obvious. Read Romans 4, and compare the traditional ""Abraham believed, and it was credited to him as righteousness"" with the unclear string of phrases Peterson used that obfuscate the basic idea. Why all the verbiage? I'm voting for the NRSV."
2,Extremely too Small,Not worth the cost or trouble to send back I lost on this item.Extremely toooooo small even for pocket size. Ordered two for gifts only received one. Tracked & reported to customer service -no response as of today. Disappointed.
3,"A Shining Lincoln Shows Tarnish, Too","Though made drearily for television, this film has a number of elements that is ahead of its time. Sam Waterston's savvy, almost hippie-like Lincoln is not at all the ""great ape"" that many of Lincoln's detractors claimed. He is like the true Abraham Lincoln. With the high-pitched Kentucky squeak in his voice (like Lincoln), Waterston is simply riveting- as Lincoln himself must have been. His terrible screech of pain during the height of the Civil War is something I had always imagined he did several times. Waterston hypnotizes with this Emmy-worthy portrayal. The facts in the film are blurry at times, the direction is plodding, the lighting is too dark- and Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Todd Lincoln must be the casting blunder of the 20th century. Yet all involved give terrific performances. Too bad there wasn't more LINCOLN to this ""Lincoln"". But all in all, it is the must-see for any interested viewer."
3,"Screams ""TV Movie""","If you enjoy historical bio-pics, this will likely appeal to you but it screams ""TV movie"". The performances are mediocre and the film looks very low budget. Both Sam Waterston and Mary Tyler Moore's portrayals of Abraham and Mary Todd were very two dimensional. I was left feeling like I never saw the real humanity of these iconic figures.Compare this to vastly superior ""Eleanor and Franklin"", the 1976 ABC mini-series about the Roosevelts. It's night and day.What I wouldn't give for a thoughtfully produced, adequately budgeted film on Lincoln. It's long overdue and this one just misses the mark in too many ways."
3,I got this for my thirteenth birthday,"I originally read this book when I was thirteen when my brother bought it for me. It didn't make a big impact then cause it was a little over my head. I've reread it a couple of times and really like the book. I just don't think that the author really got both sides of batman really well, bruce didn't seem like bruce and batman seemed a little too vindictive. Overall it was a great book and I think everyone who likes batman a little should read it. Because most people who like books that are detectives books would love this."
2,You get what you pay for,"I guess you get what you pay for. This charger works, but apparently not quite the way Sony Ericsson would like it to. When using this charger, my SE W300i often reports charging errors."
2,Cool? Breakable!,"Cool, yes. Breakbale, definitely. Whether it doesn't work for some games, maybe. But oh does it end up not working out too well."
5,This is a great controller,"I recently bought his controller and I thought it looked great, Oh, how right I was. This is the best third party controller I have ever seen! Get this. I was worth it. For my age, my haneds are fairly large, but this, because it is a bit larger than the original nintendo controller, fits perfectly. Get this one."
5,What the Doctor ordered.,Given the current world climate it is hard to find a balanced voice. Free World is that. Timothy Garton Ash has the experience needed to write such a work. His books on Europe in the late Eighties and Nineties are essential reading if you wish to understand the European epoch since the fall of the Berlin Wall. This time around he covers more ambitious territory: America vs. Europe and the place of Britain in this new post September 11th world. This is quite readable and more importantly quite wise. Ash shows clearly that propagandistic hysteria in the face of the present moment is probably the worst of all responses. He emphasizes what is crucially needed in this polarized world: Dialogue. His recommendations are keen and genuine. Buy several copies of this book and give them to friends of ANY political persuasion. Let's not talk about 'them' in superior tones. Let's realize that our differences will never disappear and talk nonetheless.
5,I love my wrench set,"I have had these wrenches for 7 years now. They have seen the insides of every motorcycle and car I have owned since then. They still look shiny, new and function flawlessly. The roll-up plastic organizer works just as well as the day I bought it, and it saves a lot of space too. If you are a bargain hunter like me, then you have found yourself a great set of tools. I highly recommend them.*drop forged*chrome plated*alloy steel*life time warranty*made in Taiwanset includes: 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 and 21 mm wrenchesI hope you enjoyed my first review..."
5,"Entertaining, Realistic and Funny!","This book is a delightful story for children. It is a story about Laura Sibbie and the mess of trouble she gets into when she starts an ""illegal"" club with her friends. (Clubs are forbidden at her school.) It starts with a hat.Written on the hat is ""Pig City"". Laura starts a club of this name. Gabriel, the one who secretly loves her, overhears information about the club and starts a mission to join. But soon confusion sets in... At the hands of Sheila, a jealous classmate. As new members are being brought into the secret club, suspicions grow... Laura begins to write messages on the board. Then the ""Monkey Town"" club is started, and then there is war between the clubs.I really enjoyed this story! This is an excellent example of Louis Sachar's brilliant work.Enjoy!"
2,"Loved the author, disliked the book","I heard this author speak recently, and I liked her speaking style so much I read the book. She was really entertaining, funny, and provocative. After reading this book, I was terribly disappointed in ""The Tame Cactus"" because it was such two- dimensional writing. Not at all like what I'd expected. I know that the author recently put out a new book of true stories about her family and childhood. I would give that one a chance,because you could tell from the author that she really was passionate about her family, but I would not recommend ""Tame Cactus"". The characters are flat, undeveloped, unbelievable and uninteresting. The events jump too quickly and not enough information is given to evoke an emotional involvement in the reader. I wanted to like this book, but I couldn't."

1,Dog got worse,My vet told me to use it on my dogs ear and his ear got worse so i have nothing to say about it bad or good. I am sure since the pills work on my dog for pain this works on someone.
1,Shipping Problems,"I can't really rate the product at this point, however I do want to say that the shipping for this product has been delayed 3 times by amazon.com. I ordered this 2 weeks ago and still haven't received it. I would love to cancel this shipment, however it's sitting in the ""being prepared for shipment"" status so I am unable to cancel it."
4,Cut your teeth on operetta,"I saw this operetta in London at the Royal National Theatre in 1999. It was so wunnerful. I just loved Simon Russell Beale and Alex Kelly and several others. I fell in love with operetta, the National, theatre, Voltaire's story, and Bernstein's music. Over the years, this CD has been one of my favourites. It is one of Leonard Bernstein's best compositions, and the National Theatre's production on this CD is excellent. The singing is good even though not excellent, and the orchestra plays well too, although not a full orchestra. Candide is one of my favourite works whether it be Voltaire's novella or Leonard Bernstein's operetta. The libretto is one of the funniest you'll find in all operetta. The philosophical tale includes delicious ironies of plot. You will not find philosophy in a more accessible, entertaining form anywhere in the performing arts with the exception of Wagner."
3,worth it,This is not a great musical but it's worth buying just for the overture. (one of the best ever)
4,Really interesting,"The fact that the author basically worked for both sides of the war, and the perspective of one village being governed by the ARVN in daylight and Viet Cong by night is pretty cool. The book drags on towards the end, especially when the author starts referencing the present, which really isn't as interesting as what I wanted to read the book for, the actual war time."
4,"Good, Almost Great","This was a good read. I would've given it five stars if it didn't have the Killer Webboard and meeting thing. Not very realistic. Most serial killers don't have the mindset to interact like that I don't think.But it was a good book, no doubt about it. Me for, I'm someone that likes extremely realistic type fiction. Like -Killer On the Road- or -The Alienist-"
4,throw rugs stay in place,doorway throw rugs stay in place when I wipe my feet. Wish it was clear. and wish it was cheaper
4,Only one problem...,"I bought this because I confused James Keane with Jimmy Keane. However, I did recognize Wilifred Horan. This is traditional Irish music with some beautiful harp playing (showcased) on a couple of cuts. (Harp being an instrument I don't normally seek out). Fine players all around. You won't get blisters on your rear listening to this, but it's feelingly done. Lovely and laid back.My complaint - I like liner notes. Nay. I love! liner notes. This was about as thin as it gets. Apparently, this is a part of a series that has to do with food?etc? I don't mind a couple of recipes, but I DO want to know the history of the tunes (who wrote them, etc.) and a bit about the players. Hence the ding from 5 stars down to 4."
2,A painless chore,"Just another dim indie band substituting droning, dumbed-downed strumming for genuine originality even if avoiding some relative pretentiousness."
2,"Hold the strings, PLEASE!","First, let me say I've always loved Jack Jones' singing! I'm a big fan! Many of his LP's from the 60's featured arrangements by the wonderfully talented Marty Paich ... and I guess I expected the same sort of magic on this CD. It wasn't there! Maybe Jack is trying to appeal to an older audience or whatever, but these arrangements use way too many strings! Strings, strings everywhere! No complaint with Jack's singing, he's still great, but, in my opinion, he desperately needed arrangements that had some life in them! The CD was a big disappointment to me!"
1,THe worst book I ever read - SHallow,"For a romance novel, this is the worst book I have ever read. The story and/or plot is completely missing. The main characters, Kit and Angela, have no character at all. Rather the story revolves around the two of them vying for the distinction of who has had the most sex partners in the past, and whether their sex together is better than that which they had with other partners. THe book should be classified as pornographic."
5,Kit will make you hot!,"Brazen has to be my favorite Susan Johnson book to date. I've only read the Braddock-Black series and A Touch of Sin, and Pasha was my favorite until Kit came along! What a man! Not sappy and sweet, but passionate and demanding. When Kit realizes his feelings run deeper than purely carnal pleasures, he would rather live without Angela than share her with an abusive husband. He is relentless in his pursuit of her. Their emotions and passionate encounters are splendidly displayed for the readers perusal. Angela is a mature woman and is without the simpering lines of a weak virgin. She knows what she wants and his name is Kit. Likewise, Kit is a man who is accustomed to getting what he wants and having Angela on his terms is top on his list. They both give as good as they get! Brazen is one spicy hot read!"
1,Total rip off!,This item was not even close to the product I orderd!! It came on time. Butt It was an item that was supper cheap. Not more than a buck..Total trash! I returned this Item!! Be careful when purchasing from this seller!!
5,Great Stuff,This is a nice small juicer that is very well built. It is easy to clean and easy to store.This is the first juicer I ever purchased and it works great for the one lemon a day I make into juice. If you need to make more than one glass of juice I would get a bigger automatic type juicer.Joe
2,Insufferable,"I admittedly have not read the book that this film is based on and would not think that as a prerequisite. Unfortunately, that is not the case. This insufferably dreary and overlong film presumes one is at least familiar with the story. This fact alone would immediately turn one off and make it signficantly more cumbersome to comprehend the inexplicably disjointed narrative this film presents.As someone who appreciates artistic and dialogue driven films I found this production tediously difficult to absorb. It was a combination of deathly slow pacing, poor direction. weak editing and a lacklustre ending. The production values were not that impressive and looked cobbled together from a Dr. Who set.On the whole I could not give it more than two stars - and that's being kind."
4,"Technical quality is far below blue ray, but content is excellent.","I agree with others who fault the technical quality of the disk. It is far below usual blue ray, and probably not worth the extra cost compared with DVD. However, shopping around, I found a blue ray disk for a few bucks more than the DVD. That seemed OK. And, to echo the others, this is the best spy movie ever made. Friends of mine who have jazz bands tell me that, in music, the audience can tolerate large amounts of technical in-expertise. But they know immediately when a band's heart is not in the music and just walk away. Same goes, IMHO, for this DVD. Alec Guinness and the entire crew put so much heart into this production that I really don't care about the technical quality of the blue ray. I first saw this on BBC TV in Hong Kong in 1982 on a 19 inch TV sitting in the roof garden of the YMCA. And I would watch it again on VHS if I had to."
1,"Tinker,Tailor.Soldier,Spy, DVD","The drama and acting are superb and worth the watch. And pay attention- as whispers become plot turners.The DVD is poor quality and has many and frequent hiccups, stops, freezes, sound and picture freeze- ups which are damned annoying and make you work for the experience. It could be the transfer of medium from the BBC video to American video protocol.Well, it was not a success.Beware the poor DVD recording quality and interrupted playback and freeze frame glitches.I would get it somewhere else which will allow returns for poor quality DVD transfer.Summary:The Drama =successThe medium of sale and delivery= failed, tolerable at best, to get to the drama.I would not take another chance with these BBC transferred videos.I would send this DVD back if I could.This DVD should not have been sold.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DXCO94/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img"
5,"tinker, tailor, soldier, spy",We totally enjoyed watching this story. The current movie by the same title moved us to buy the original mini series.Excellent!!
2,I love love love Le Carre BUT...,"I love le Carre. I love the Karla Trilogy stuff, I adore the'90s stuff (Game, Single, Night)... BUT:His books are his books and the movies are the movies, and a lot of the '70s British stuff -- like this miniseries and ""Deadly Affair"" and even ""Perfect Spy"" -- are made in a style I find INTERMINABLY DULL.It's not just the slow pace (I like slow when it's full of import), it's the browns and greys and the quality of the audio and ... man, I'm getting sleepy just thinking about it."
4,Peace of mind when you aren't home,"I always worry about my home catching fire when I'm away at work and the firemen not knowing I have pets inside. These stickers are a good deal, you can't find them locally for this price - and they have a reflective coating so if a flashlight is aimed on them in the dark, they can be seen pretty well. My only complaint is I wish they were the static cling type, which are easier to remove when they become faded from the sun and need replaced."
4,"Thankfully, have not needed it yet.",Very easy to see. Good quality. Hate they put the company name and info in the corner. Cheesy way to get some cheap marketing.
5,Excellent bag,"Got this for travel with a music group to haul my tux and other stuff, which happens pretty frequently. Very well made and the hanger latch device is great ."
5,Great reference,I bought this book to get more information about Floyd Rose tremolo units before I had one installed into my Strat. It quickly became the most useful guitar reference in my library. it seems to have useful information about pretty much anything having to do with playing the guitar.
4,"basic chords & chord theory, basic music elements","good amount of detail, but needs work putting everything together. I like the background on player such as Frank Zappa in sections and little biographies such as Steve Vai. Beginners could be frustrated without patience since you won't learn any songs, but mostly technical stuff and theory."
4,Not bad at all,"This is the second Masterton book i've read as i thought i would take a break from Koontz and try something different. This book is good in my opinion , even though the ending was somewhat shocking. At first i had to read the last page of this book twice , to be sure i read it correctly. As others have noted the ending is disappointing , but after i had time to think about it , the ending is quiet realistic.I think the author wanted to portray the message of ; everything doesn't always turn out as we expect. People are used to reading a sunshiney ending. I think this book is real and sadly some of things in this book do actually happen, whether we want to face the fact or not.I've read many of the reviews for this book and it seems to me if you don't like a sad read I wouldn't suggest a horror subcategory. After all books are for our amusement and there are plenty to choose from."
4,Very Simple and Easy to Use,"This is very simple and easy to use. It is advisable to use hot water for ultrasonic cleaners (around 150F). You may need to add a little soap or ammonia to make it work best. Water alone is not sufficient.- It does work, but don't expect it to work like the professional jeweler uses- Big enough to hold eye glasses- Not an eyesore, it actually looks nice. It has a soothing blue LED light inside.- It comes with a plastic rack for easy removal of your jewelries- At 35W, it consumes less energy than a light bulb- Very affordableRooms for improvement:- The 3-minute cycle is not enough. An adjustable timer would be nice."
5,Good Value and Performance,"This product represents excellent value, quality and performance. It cleaned jewelry shiny as new with a few drops of dishwashing detergent added to the water. I was happy with my purchase and glad I did not buy one of the more expensive cleaners."
2,Haier HU335W Ultrasonic Cleaner,"Haier HU335W Ultrasonic Cleaner cleans gold really great. It doesn't do much of anything for silver which really disappointed me because I have lots of silver that is really tarnished. I ran the silver through numerous times with a few drops of detergent, as recommended. It remained tarnished. Gold, on the other hand, looks like it just came from the jewelry store. Not so sure its worth the money. Try another manufacturer."
1,nice build-terrible cleaning,Dandy build quality. More than I expected for ~$40. But I might have well been soaking things in a glass of water. I've had cleaners before that actually worked. This made noise and nothing more. The instructions say to use water. That wouldn't work even if this thing did. So I added untrasonic cleaning liquid and tried it again. Still nothing. Off to Sharper Image for the ~$80 one I guess.
1,Don't recommend product =0(,Unfortunately a waste of money. Didn't really clean the pieces that needed to be cleaned. Just shined up the ones that were already cleaned. Polish cloths worked 100% better.
3,Can't touch the big boys,This is a small cleaner which does the trick for gold and gems. Not powerful enough to remove tarnish from silver even with jewelery cleaner. Would have spend a little more to buy an American made product.
5,Works great,I bought this for my mother as a Christmas present. I used it a couple times and it seems to do an excellent job cleaning jewelry. This cleans with just water and no harsh chemicals. You can see all the dirt at the bottom of the tank when it's done.
2,It's ok with less than a year,I purchased this product to clean my Invisilign retainers. It did an okay job for almost a year but then it died on me. This equipment might be a good idea for occasional use but not everyday. Reliability is not there yet!.
2,Time Burned,"Unoriginal glamrock outing featuring a multitude of anachronistic guitar riffs--these guys would have been huge had this album come out in 1982, but 1992? The world has moved on, fellas. No shortage of clean, Satriani-esque fast finger solos here though, and decent melodies, so if you're still playing your Cinderella and Great White albums, you'll have a field day here."
2,"Interminable,.",Tension builds as the clock counts down-- can you stand the interminable book as a meaningless arbitrary deadline approaches? Lot of action in a weak plot and no charachter development. I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 because there was just enough there for me to finish the book.
2,Green not at his best.,"I'll start by saying I have read every last one of Green's books and have enjoyed them for the msot part. Never to be confused with great literature his books dwell ont he worst scenario possible side of life. This book like the others coudl use more character development and a bit more attention to detail. A carful reader will spot holes in the plot and other mistakes. Having highlighted the authors weakness, I confess that his style is highly entertaining, fast paced, and he comes up with great metaphors and descriptions.This novel starts well, but the plot and tesnison relies to heavily on the suppsoed 48 hour rule. To me the timeclcok did not feel real enough to justify the urgency. Other than that The First 48 would get three stars for the fun easy read it is."
3,A Disappointing Story but Spectacular Ending,"There's not much of a story here in this book, however, what kept me reading this novel was the interesting main characters, and the absolute thrilling final 100 pages that I could not, and did not put down.I began reading this novel because I am a fan of Tim Green's other works, and through the first 250 pages, I was unimpressed. Then the final 100 pages or so caught me by surprise, and are among Green's best work.All in all, a good book to read on the weekend, but not one of Tim Green's best."
3,Good Quick Read,"I found this book to be very entertaining. It's no Joseph Conrad or James Joyce; it is what it is. The characters are flawed and funny and the plot moves at a swift, albeit predictable pace. Great summer read!"
1,Generic Thriller,"Having read and enjoyed a couple of Tim Green's other books, I picked this one up hoping for more of the same. But this is strictly a by the numbers mystery with boring characters and a lousy plot. The Publishers Weekly and Booklist reviews hit it on the head. Green's earlier work, like ""The Fourth Perimeter"" is much better."
4,"Good text, but lacks examples","This text reads well, and does a good job covering the important concepts in scientific computing. The only thing I've noticed is sometimes missing specific examples. Sometimes the sample problems are not clear as to what is expected...Overall, its a text that is good to learn from, but maybe not the best for practice(note: i have not yet worked through the computer programming example, these look promising)"
4,do not be a child,"This is good industrial tape for use holding things in their proper place or for temporary fix-it situations. I have not read the famous book about uses for this tape, but perhaps you could find something really useful there.Please do not be childish with this tape. Tape is not a fahion statement. It is a tool. Do not put on your clothes and go to school. Do not put all over your backpack, unless your backpack is falling apart and you cannot afford a new backpack. Then you may fix with duct tape. Do not apply duct tape to a backpack in good condition.I approve of duct tape. You should too."
3,Useful...but not a walkthrough.,"I bought this strategy guide assuming it would contain walkthroughs of every level and strategies for each level. However, this book does not truly contain walkthroughs. Sure it tells you where the items are and a helpful little snippet for each proquest stunt (its in the back of the book not with the level maps), but it is still far from a walkthrough. Also the maps don't look very professional and neither does the layout of the book. However, it does have its strong points and did show me how to get all the gaps. But it is not the most useful book ever.Hint (not in book): The strat guide does not tell you the cheap way to get off 4-100 trick combo's. Simply do a nose manual, and then jump (x button) and then do another nose manual before you land. Rinse and repeat as wanted and you've got a cheap combo."
4,Good enough,"Very cheap and functional, it looks and feel cheaper and lesser quality than the Nintendo orginal controls, but works well and so far my nephews have had no problems with it. Definitively a good buy for the price."
3,An old chan movie is better than anyone else's best movies,"One of Jackie's breakout movies with some actual comedy, rather than the Bruce Lee imitation he was forced into with the first 8 films or so. another viewer on this site says that they like drunken master 2 better. Drunken master 2 is probably his best kung-fu film, so this isn't saying much. It was also made in 1994, and it was NOT made by lo wei. I put this movie almost on par with drunken master one. If you're not a Jackie fan, yet, start with Mr. Nice Guy or Rumble in the Bronx; this one's for die hards only."
3,protectors,"THE ITEM WAS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS, THE DESCRIPTION WAS NOT REAL CLEAR AND I READ IT WRONG. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALRIGHT IF IT WAS WHAT I NEEDED. MY BAD."
3,egh,"They arrived quickly, but there wasn't 25 per box--one box seemed pretty old. The ones we got where fine, did the job--cheap enough that we didn't bother quabbling over the missing few. Would I buy again probably not."
4,a good start,"Despite being passed off as one by the record company and playing shows with bands along that line, With passion are not a metalcore band. They play more of a blackened thrash with death and black metal vocals. They are extreme, fast, and heavy, and the only reason why i can think of them being considered metalcore, is because their lyrics are more about relationshiops, as opposed to church burnings and murder like their other black metal counterparts. Check em out."
5,Better than standard carry case,"This is a heavy duty, ripstop nylon case that is much heavier and more protective that the thin case included with the Silk tripod. Since I carry this everyday I'm very glad I upgraded to this heavier case. The tripod slips right in, a perfect fit and the shoulder strap is secure and wide enough to spread the weight over the shoulder."
4,Love Slik!,"I've got a SLIK Tripod and Monopod - I love them both. This case will hold the tripod perfectly, and it takes a little wiggling, but it will hold the monopod as well."
3,the 1934 release of She,"The DVD was marred by a series of clicks on the audio through the first five minutes of the film. I wanted to see it because it made an impression on me when I was about 10 years old. It turned out to be a little disappointing to see it as an adult. The effects were not as effective when compared with today's CGI's, but I was impressed when I was a kid."
4,Revealing hoaxsters and raising doubts about others...,"The author presents an interesting collection of well documented essays (and a few historical photographs) that intrigue and educate the reader about some of the greatest adventurer and discovery hoaxes over the centuries. His most interesting inquiry is saved for the reader to ponder. ""How many claimed discoveries and adventures that we unquestionably and faithfully accept as true were also mere fantasy?"" Did Hannibal really cross the Alps? Was it Tenzig Norgay first to summit on Everest or was it Hillary? If Neil Armstrong was the first man on the moon, who took the famous picture of him descending from the space capsule planting a foot firmly onto Moon soil? This book can get you thinking."
3,Aless than successful musical,"Having seen the OBC tryout in Philadelphia in the early 60s, I felt a need to add this to my collection. It is not a memorable score, with the possible exception of ""Once Upon a Time."" Too bad the CD does not also include the dialog, as it would be fun to recall the Mel Brooks work of that time period."
3,"the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak","I wanted to like this mystery novel more than I did. The characters are ""real people"": you know them, you like them, you understand and share their foibles, their fears, their sins. And it is refreshing to find a mystery novel driven by religious belief: because the concept of the separation of church and state is so strong in our society, we've come to accept that religious belief should be separate from all aspects of our lives [read Stephen Carter's excellent ""The Culture of Disbelief"", when indeed it is central not only to our lives, but to our selves. But the author wasn't able to carry through what he began so well. Some scenes seemed contrived, and the ending was too pat to justify the earlier menace. Still, an easy read and I'll try this author again."
5,"Very Strong, nice looking vise","Got the bench vise at Amazon at a relatively good price. Installed it on the bench in the garage. Item is quite big and heavy. Good for heavy engine parts like CV joints, etc. The paint on it is not very high quality, but it does the job. Very pleased with the product."
5,Great soundtrack,I have to say that I love this soundtrack. Alan Alda is just amazing in it! I think that every fan should have this cd.
2,Despicable Me DVD,"DVD arrived quickly but I was disappointed that it has quit a few scratches on it and therefore has quite a few places during the movie where it completely stops, interrupting the movie experience."
5,Adorable,absolutely love this movie! it's so much fun (and so FLUFFY!)! The additional shorts are hysterical as well! Def. recommend this!
2,Too boring.,"I consider myself a lover a children's animated features, and when a movie puts me to sleep, that says it all."
5,Family fare at its finest,A delightful animated family film. I am looking forward to a sequel. It has excellent animation and an endearing story.
5,Good Buy,"With Three Discs in the package it is the most practical purchase. Digital for my computer/phone, Blue Ray for me, and regular DVD for grandkids :) Oh & the movie is great!"
5,Clever and Funny,"This is a great movie, and many of the best movies made are now animated features. It's a silly and lame plot, but what carries the movie are the diversity and the likability of the characters. A truly clever and fun movie for everyone."
5,Fun movie,This quickly became one of our favorite movies. The villains are not scary for younger children and it's very entertaining for both younger and older audiences. Definitely a movie the family can enjoy together.
5,Great Movie,Such a great movie for the whole family. Humor mom and dad will enjoy ... and of course entertaining for the kids!
5,Laughs for the whole family,"This has to seriously be one of my favorite movies of all time. I wasn't expecting to like it but I love it and find myself quoting it regularly. It's hilarious and sweet. My 3 year old loves it, my 55 year old husband loves it and I love it. So it covers lots of generations!"
5,"Charming, Sweet, Amusing and Definitely Worth Watching...","I usually feel distracted while watching an animated film. I rarely ""want"" to watch one. When I do view one I will because someone else is or very highly recommends it and hands me their copy. I had heard Despicable Me was adorable and funny etc. etc. about thirty times. But I waited quite awhile before renting it.I was utterly charmed. Very Mad-Magazine spyesque with a sweet, sweet addition of charming, heart-warming characters to soften the despicability and cartoon violence of the whole premise. I loved this film and the characters. Completely."
1,Don't purchase this movie,"I purchased Despicable Me (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy) for my granddaughter's birthday. The Blu-ray would not play properly. The DVD would stop playing & freeze in the middle of the movie. I returned Despicable Me to Amazon for a replacement, only to receive a DVD with the exact problem. Don't purchase this movie, if you do you'll be disappointed."
5,Fun and Funny,It is amazing what they can do with cartoons there days. I love watching them. The music totally kicked ass!
3,A friendly goodhearted romp,"A friendly goodhearted romp about a dastardly villain whose greatest scheme backfires magnificently and then learns what he truly values. Yeah, schmaltzy, but well executed. 3D is used to reasonably good effect a few times but the movie doesn't suffer without it."
2,Uninteresting,"I rated this film two stars because the animation wasn't bad but the story was very weak and so lacking in humor that, although I rented it, I couldn't finish watching, I just have better things to do. The very beginning was promising as it generated a chuckle but that was it for me."
2,Not so good,Mostly sight gags that got a few giggles. The story wasn't very engaging. My daughter got bored and didn't want to watch the whole movie. First time that has ever happened. Skip this one.
5,Cute movie,It is great movie! It is also funny movie...this is good for children and adults. This is very great product!
5,Despicable Me,"I absolutely love this movie, so to now own it makes my life so much easier! And no, I'm not like 8 years old!"
5,best!,this has to be one of the best cartoons I have seen! It makes you happy and sad but it is overrall excellent!
4,Movie,I couldn't download this movie after several attempts. I reset my Kindle and it didn't help. I'm not sure what the problem was. I have comtacted customer support.
2,Waste of time for an adult,Turn off your brain and the graphics deserve 2 stars. Maybe there's a young adolescent market that would find it funny.
4,Despicable Code,Great DVD and Blu Ray.... But where is the code to access the Digital copy not exactly helpful when try download it....
1,Be aware.,"Buyers be aware that even though the description and the picture show the Three disc Blu-ray, DVD, digital copy combo package that is not what you receive. As others have stated what you receive is the two disc blu-ray & DVD only. The movie itself is fantastic but if you are expecting a digital copy you will be disappointed."
5,Great Movie!!,Great Movie!! It's funny and the kids loved it too. I would recommend for any age to watch this movie.
4,Despicable,I am not a huge fan of this movie. It showed up on the doorstep Christmas Eve so the delivery was awesome. (earlier than stated) DVD in great shape. The case was warped but soon went back to normal shape in the heat of the house. My boys love it so it's great.
3,Cute,Good movie for Family movie night. Some good laughs and a sweet story. Steve Carrel and Jason Segal voice the main characters and are both funny.
5,Great benign movie everyone can enjoy,"I was a little worried when the gangster rap came on and the main guy shot his icegun at the crowded coffee shop, but that was pretty much the worst thing that happened, the rest was just fun."
4,minions video,"very cute and funny ...however, extremely short for the money...buyer beware...someone needs to do a full length video of just these guys"
1,does not work,Bad business! So disappointed and I hope that this will be rectified because my granddaughter is extremely disappointed. Will not work in ANY DVD player
5,Despicable Me,"This was a surprisingly funny, and well done movie, I was impressed with the story line that developed. Would recommend to others."
4,Who doesn't like Evil Geniuses,This movie makes me laugh with the minions and the evil geniuses having such a big heart. Great for any age if you retain that sense of wonder that is needed in life.
5,Brilliant,A great movie that the entire family can enjoy!We enjoyed it from start to end.The humour is appropriate for all ages and is entertaining for adults too.
4,despicable me,"We liked that it was clean , humorous, and action packed.Fun for the kids and enough action that the Dad wasn't completely bored."
3,"Cute, but forgettable","This movie was cute and I'm glad we rented it, but the kids show no interest in owning it or seeing it again."
5,my kids love this movie,I ordered this movie when it was on sale for only $5.00! Definately a great buy! my kids love this movie and I think it is super cute as well!
5,Excellent Movie,"This is a great movie for all ages. My wife and I watched this movie with no kids and still found it very entertaining. I would recommend this movie to anyone that's looking for a light-hearted, funny movie to simply kick back and let it entertain you."
1,Despicable me DVD blue ray and digital copy,I bought this movie that has the digital copy inside which it was expired last year :0( and the case is broken so not very happy with it
2,Negative Review for Seller- not item,"I ordered this item New. It arrived with scratches and fingerprints on both the DVD and the Blu-Ray. Both items skipped and neither would play the movie without missing entire scenes, even after cleaning. Very disappointing. I will not order from this seller again.Return was easy but I could not simply get a replacement because the item was sold by a third-party and not Amazon. My only option was a refund then I had to order it from Amazon directly."
4,"Not Pixar, but very good","This isn'tMonsters, Inc.orThe Incrediblesby any stretch of the imagination, but ""Despicable Me"" was a surprisingly good flick. The animation was solid and the character was excellent.The plot moved along nicely and it was funny--there were even some laugh out loud moments. The premise- how does a world-renowned bad guy top a evil competitor in the face of the harrowing threat of three adorable orphan girls. Good stuff. Include this in your DVD library!"
5,Adorable,"Very funny movie!! I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie, but was instantly hooked. Its one that I could watch many times over."
3,"Fun, light, sassy characters","This book's re-release came at a perfect time for me to remember why I liked it in the first place. It's not a deep book (nothing unpredictable here), but it has fun characters who enjoy (despite their protestations) each other's company. You get two romances for the price of one.The ending was a bit of a downer for me (I won't say why so as not to spoil it), but perhaps it needed to show Dennie's need for independence (the main female character), which may have been important back when this was first written, but is something we take for granted now (at least I do)."
4,More records should have sounded like this one,"This is a great record, in that all the instruments sound GREAT. Also, the song structures are actually.....well, INTERESTING; there's lots going on with all the countermelodies, not to mention the alternately twangy and blowtorch bass. It's those little subtle things that make a recordYet another fine example of what heavy sounding rock ought to and should be. Buy the album.Oh, and the drumming is outstanding....I almost forgot to mention.'nuff said"
3,From a teacher's perspective,"As a teacher I agree with a lot of the information that Alfie Kohn presented about assessment. There is a problem in our schools with coersion and competition. We are not intrinsically motivating our students to want to learn. We are teaching them to do things for a reward, a grade or praise.However, if the teacher is aware of this, he/she can create a community of learners that encourage learning for learning sake and not only for gain. They'll create an environment of cooperation and teamwork in a low stress environment.This video made me think about how I will give feedback to my students in order to promote effort as opposed to the grade. Also, it made me think about what to do about the student who continually underperforms based on assessments. How do I keep them motivated?"
1,Not very sturdy,Got these for my daughter for christmas. Holder was very sharp on one side. If u push too hard the utensils bend. Thought they would be a step up from the 12.00 set without the rack but they r the same with the exception of the black handles. They were we're returned. If you don't need a rack save yourself some money and get the other ones. You can buy 3 sets and still be ahead.
3,If you don't mind noise,"I recently purchased the Zr100...I'm pretty camera literate and knew Canon to be a good brand. Brought the camera home and was playing with...when I was watching what I had recorded I noticed a ""white noise"" in the background...even when people were talking. The motor/fan on this camera is so loud that it really distorts and videos you take...it sounds like an old reel to reel is running 5 feet away. I called Canon about it and they suggested that I play background sound while recording to drown out the sound of the motor...well that doesn't work for video taping school plays etc...I'm returning this camera...hopefully not all MiniDVs have this problem."
4,Chapter 15,"Chapter 15 of ""Materials Science for Engineers"" describes the physical properties of electrical behavior. This chapter does a good job of explaining the properties of conduction and resistance. It also explains why metals are good conductors and what actually happens in a semiconductor material. This textbook is good as a prerequisite text before starting the core studies in electrical engineering. It provides a good background to the phenomena of electrical behavior at the atomic level.This chapter, as well as the other chapters involving electricity, deal with material properties and not the physics of electricity.This chapter hints at the property of superconductivity. I still don't fully comprehend this topic after reading chapter 15, but there are numerous publications written about this concept alone."
5,Some recordings deserve far more than 5 stars!,"Surely one of the most brilliant shows ever done on Broadway and I would include such stellar ones a My Fair Lady and Kismet. MHF is a powerful, rousing, joyous show, much beyond the run of most Broadway productions. Loesser was at his absolute top when he put this one together. The scoring was incredible, demanding the absolute most from his singers. (I did this show in stock with Keith Kalldenberg doing Tony.) We used to say that Loesser scored it for high first tenors...then raised it all a third! The brightness of the singing, captured on this recording, is a total delight to the ear. And the incredibly capable cast put all the emotion into the numbers they could possibly have done. This is, to me, a 10 star recording of a 10 star show. You'll listen to it for years...laughing and crying along with everyone else who owns it."
5,An inspiration for aspiring first time authors.,Wiese has hit a home run with his first book. The book reads like an engaging movie. Wiese breaks many of the unwritten rules for main characters in his book and it gives the book a unique feel. I finished the book in less then 48 hours.
2,"Not A Book! This is Four (4) Pages and a ""Kinko's"" cover.","Although these four copier paper pages are full of somewhat helpful but dated information. Potential buyers should hesitate spending $6.55 (includes shipping) for 2 sheets of paper folded in half with a cardboard cover. Sorry, not worth it."
1,Waste of money,"This is not a book but an old (and bad) high school term paper. While service was great and receipt was quick, I have asked for a refund because the product was unacceptable."
3,Too flimsy,"The reinforcing wire is too weak. When I pushed it on the air intake it hung down closing off about a fourth of the opening. I solved that problem by putting a wooden support under it, but when air flow is interrupted by sucking up against something, the hose jumps and the coils really snap to the shortest length. The plastic looks a little thin but there are no holes in it yet and I guess time will tell.This hose reminds me of my first (unsuccessful) attempt to build a home made dust collection system using dryer hose. It is stronger than a dryer hose, but not really adequate for the task for which it is designed.My Peachtree hose had none of these problems. It is much stronger."
4,Pretty nice Eurpean classical rock from Johansson brothers,"I like the music on this cd alot especially with the great vocals of Goran Edman and great keyboard playing from the best Jens Johanson, however the guitar playing was pretty disappointing. Mike Romeo has horrible tone, and doesn't add any beuty to the music with his soloing just shred crap. He is no Yngwie, not even close to the dramatic vibrato and beutiful classical playing of Yngwie malmsteen, that's who should have played guitar on this cd. Overall I like the music composition it's mostly in the vain of Rainbow and Yngwie style with alot of nice classical keyboard playing with a nice touch of Deep Purple style."
2,Not great.,"Doheny's book is more about his personal interpretations of the songs than stories surrounding the creative and recording process (a problem because, after all, the book is subtitled 'the stories behind every song'). This wouldn't be so bad, but the author's take on the albums consists mostly the kind of pedestrian ""rock expert"" pretentiousness you can find for free on a million music web sites. (""OK Computer"" is the first 'genuine song cycle' since ""Dark Side of the Moon."" YAWN.)Some of the information is interesting, but some of it is just plain wrong, e.g. ""Exit Music (for a film)"" in fact is NOT heard on the ""Romeo + Juliet"" soundtrack.Perhaps worst of all, Doheny makes enemies of ""Spinal Tap"" fans everywhere by claiming that ""Nigel Smalls"" called ""the key of B minor"" the saddest of all keys. That statement alone is grounds for a refund."
5,Wow - this is really a great CD!,"Was referred by a friend and was just blown away by how good this album is. I play in a band in SF, CA and we are always looking for new and interesting sounds. Not only is Bill Kopper a talented and innovative guitarist, the fact that he wrote and co-produced this album says a lot. I highly recommend this CD and am checking on other work he has done. This was a very pleasant surprise when you consider all of the bland crap that is being over-marketed these days. Enjoy!"
5,"Great content, outstanding production","I teach courses in music education technology, and use this in my course when we discuss the varieties of notation.Mark's work, a beautiful collection of scores that were realized each week by different musicians at the Cantor Art Center, is ideally suited to DVD presentation. Two videos present a scrolling version of the score panels, and there's a 20-minute documentary of the work featuring insightful interviews. The centerpiece is a video presenting photos and one-minute audio samples from each performance.I've heard Mark describe his music as ""uncompromising and unmarketable"", and there will be some who agree. Those who like a work that explores some of the foundational ideas of music as an art will enjoy this."
5,Great item,"I bought this drill press for my husband and he loves it. He researched several brands and models and narrowed it down to this one and one that had a variable speed for much more money. He was looking for a heavy duty floor drill press that would handle pretty thick steel.PROS - large base for stability, work light positioned to iluminate the drill bit, large table with slits to anchor a metal vise, very heavy duty to handle most jobs that anyone would doCONS - table doesn't rotate which forces him to reposition item for next hole, have to reposition belts for different speedsEven though I went with the free standard shipping, we were contacted the next working day to arrange delivery (shipped on a semi and needs 2 strong men or a forklift to remove from truck). Very fast delivery!"
4,A fun exciting read,"This books is really cool. Its targeted to someone already kinda familiar with physics and Quantum Mechanics but you only need the most basic understanding. The book gives reasonably precise explanations (without too much math) of why anti-particles must exist. Feynman's style is generally quite readable. Overall, I had fun and learned a lot.I would not recommend this book for someone who has studied quantum mechanics at all however. It assumes you're familiar with a lot of the terminology and concepts."
1,Fan of both Genres but ...,"So I love blues and I love lounge, and music I enjoy the most is a fusion of different styles, which is why Putamayo has put out some great stuff. That said, this one should work right? Well I've learned from this CD that some things should be left well enough alone. Blues and Lounge DO NOT go together. Blues is meant to reach deep into your soul and wrench it out. Put an electronic beat over it and it's rendered meaningless. Lounge has it's place and works great fused with world, pop, house and any number of other genres, but with blues? Absolutely not!"
4,Unique Material,"I'm a long-time fan of the blues - and, no, this is not your typical blues CD, but I like it. As one reviewer said, it gets better and better, too, with each hearing. It makes me want to explore to see if there are other albums like this out there.I found this to be eerie electronic stuff more than blues. To be honest, I'm not sure what to label this music, if you can put a label on it at all. I gave it a shot because I saw it at my local library and, for free, took it home to listen. I was so impressed that a few days later, I bought a CD rom an Amazon seller.All I can say is, give this a shot....but beware, it's kinda strange. My guess is you'll love it or hate it. I love it, especially those two ""Little Ax"" numbers."
1,Boo hiss! Kodak should know better!,"I bought this memory card for a Christmas present and promptly returned it when I realized it's not compatible with my older, perfectly healthy Kodak camera. Kodak has switched to a new format of memory chip - a PROPRIETARY ONE - which means if you invest in this camera, you're stuck buying over-priced chips only from Kodak. I'm disapointed in Kodak and will buy instead an older Kodak model which allows for industry-standard compact flash storage. - Robertson Adams, Miami, Fla."
1,"Not true to the series, full of mistakes.","Any fan of the series knows certain things to be true about the two main characters, Remo and Chiun. This book takes those axioms and destroys them.It, in one page, ignores and obliterates some of the key beliefs and history of the previous 109 books.We need Warren Murphy back at the helm. The plot was sketchy, the characters shallow, and our hero, Remo, is now a cross between James Bond, Charlie Chan, and IBM's Big Blue."
4,"Wonderful, and sadly out of print","This is quite possibly my favorite guidebook for any city in the world. It will take you on detailed walks through the hidden streets of Venice to places you'd never find on your own, such as the only remaining doorway of Marco Polo's childhood home.Now, make no mistake--this should not be the only guidebook you bring to Italy. For one thing, it's been out of print for 20 years, so any copy you buy will be out-of-date when it comes to restaurants, opening times, etc. (That's why I give it only 4 stars.)For another thing, this book's greatest strength is also it's major weakness: it doesn't try to tell you everything about the city; instead, it focuses on fascinating detail on a handful of blocks.For both those reasons, you'll want a more recent and more conventional guidebook to supplement this one.But do take this guide as well--it's like having a private tour of the city with somebody who knows the fascinating story behind every secret corner."
2,"not properly advertised cowboy boots, not wellington",I do not believe these boots were properly advertised. Not my idea of Wellingtons
3,Snow rake review,"This snow rake is good at best. I purchased this item for my two story roof to remove snow and icicles. The head of the rake is very well constructed but the poles do not lock together well with the spring push buttons. The buttons do not pop tottally through the holes once the extension poles are put together. The first time I used the rake I lost the head off of the poles on the roof. I had to retrive it with a ladder. Also the poles are very lightweight construction. I didn't even assemble all four sections, I only used three of the four, and I was very concerned about the handle bending and breaking. Overall I would rate this item as good."
2,Not much left of it after 2 uses,"It started with one of the wheels shattering (it's still there - just square). Then I lost almost all of the bolts even though I tightened them securely according to directions. The left brace is somewhere on my roof - hopefully I'll find it in the spring. The locking button froze when I tried to add another length to reach higher. I was using it on what the meteorologists are calling ""champagne powder"" when it started to disintegrate. It WAS effective in clearing a lot of the snow but I had to rebuild it first."
4,The Price is Right,"After reviewing varouis drill presses it came down to the tried and true Jet. This drill press has been around and quite popular among fellow end users,and what I found in this 17inch class was 2 manufacturers offered 4 inches or more quill travel: Jet JDP-17MF @ 4-3/8 inches of travel and Palmgren @ 5+ inches of travel. Prices were close until my local Woodcraft broke the dilemma with a sale on Jet. Since then I have added accessories on to the drill press; Rockler table w/fence & dust port, laser light, jacobs keyless chuck and a HTC mobile base. Also i bought some drill rod, chucked it up ,and ran a dial indicator to check run out: .0012 not bad for being made in China. Why only 4 stars ? the belts are starting to get flat spots on them and its getting a little loud, an easy fix."
3,Pleasant,"Musically, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is no blockbuster. But it's never less than modestly entertaining and, at its worst, only pleasant. I imagine this made a wonderful theater experience and might make a fine college production today. I doubt I'll ever get a chance to see this one, though. So the album will have to do."
3,Okay,"My dog suffers from food allergies and occasionally has a skin reaction. If she chews, it sometimes develops into bacterial infections and yeasty skin and then turns into dry skin as it clears up. I was recommended this product from my vet and paid $16 for it.I was not impressed with this shampoo. I did not notice it to do anything better than any other decent hydrating/sensitive skin shampoo from a local pet store.For this price, I do not know if I would recommend this product. It does have a pleasant almond scent."
2,Playtex 18 hr #4395 bra,My fault as I accidently ordered the incorrect size and had to return it. Waiting until after the holidays to re-order the correct size. Pat
5,Easy Spirit Medley,"I have worn these shoes for over 10 years on my daily walk. The most comfortable and durable, especially on long walks."
3,Easy spirit shoe,"This is going to mixed review. The good is that these are the most comfortable pair of shoes I own. The negative is that I had to take to be repaired after only wearing them a short time because the sole separated from the uppers. They just aren't well made. I returned the first pair I owned because I thought I had just gotten a bad pair but the same thing happened to the second. But, because, they are so comfortable I decided to go the effort and expense to have them repaired."
4,Love these shoes.,"Very comfortable, good support without being too big like a sports shoe. Only complaint is the rubber trim at the bottom does tend to start coming apart faster that I though it would."
5,The Original,I have been looking for this Album at a reasonable price for years. I had one of the original Cassette Tapes of this amazing work second only to Handels original score. The reoccurring takes on the Young Messiah were good but nothing like this album. It cost a considerable amount more than it did in 1990 which I attribute to its genius.
1,black stuff in water,"I have had two of these so far. The first one leaked when water was filled all the way to the top. Therefore I was only able to fill it up about half way. Soon the lid also broke so that each time I poured water into a cup, the lid would slide off. The second one I got was fine. But every now and then, the black carbon particles would end up in the filtered water. Sometimes the water would taste as though it had not been filtered at all. I rely on this product because it is the only realistic way for me to get filtered water here in my college dorm. I really wish there was another company that made a better product."
2,No good,"Can't recommend this product. Have been using this brita pitcher for over a month now, and the filter continues to leave small black carbon particles in the filtered water with each filtration. As such, the filter is unusable, and I'm deeply disappointed."
1,Not what I EXPECTED.,"I was not happy with this product at all. The style is nice, slim design and great for in the door of your refrigerator however, the waters taste nasty. I thought maybe it was because it was new but even a couple days after changing the water out everyday it still tasted horrible. I have drank many different types of bottled water as well as city water and well water but this stuff is just horrible. It leave a very bad after taste. If you know someone who has one of these, try the water 1st before you spend money buying one of these. Everyone in my family agreed this water is not drinkable."
5,Great item,This product filter my tap water and makes it taste great. Its a great slim size so it doesn't take a lot of room in my fridge. The replacement filter is reasonably priced to change out after a few months. If you are looking for a small pitcher that doesn't take alot of room and filters your water properly then go with this Brita 42629 Slim Pitcher.
5,Great for fridge doors!,This water pitcher is great for dorms! It fits perfectly in the fridge door shelf.Although it might be too small if you are sharing it with 2+ people.
5,Brita Slim Pitcher,There are just too many chemicals in our water today and if you aren't using a system to filter out the polutants from your water then I recommend that you try the Brita Slim Pitcher. Takes up very little room in your refridgerator.
5,Love It!!,Wantd to try the Brita water filtration system but did not want to spend alot of money and did not want to get a really big one. This one was the perfect size and since we got it we have decided to get a bigger one.
5,Good taste,"Very good in condition. I prepared the filter as described, and had no problem about carbon dust in the filtered water. Water tastes better significantly. The open spout is the thing that should be carefully considered."
2,Annoying!,"I am so disappointed in my Brita!!! I bought it on 5/3/12 at Shopko. I have used it consistantly, and every single time the top falls off, and it's very annoying to have to hold it on. It doesn't seem to fit securely at all. I have not kept the box, etc. so I can't take it back. It is the slim model. Thank you!"
4,"Small, but doable.","It's a Brita water filter pitcher, follow directions and put filter in. It work and doesn't leak. Just make sure to put the filter in correctly or it will let water leak though.Pros:-Makes any tap water bearable to drinkCons:-Doesn't filter fluoride-A little small for a pitcherOn a good note, I did like how Brita included a sticker to make sure you change the filter when it says. Although, I can sensitive taste buds so I know when it is going bad. I recommend spending a little more and getting a larger one. Then again, I just drink a lot of water."
4,"Great pitcher, but too small.","I am a college student so I bought this pitcher so I wouldn't need to waste money on bottled water. Overall, the pitcher has been great. The water is clean and tastes pretty good. The only negative is it is TOO SMALL. It only has a capacity of 40 oz. I am the only one who drinks from the pitcher and I blow through it pretty quick, especially on hot days. It kinda is a hassle to refill it during the day. It takes a few minutes to filter the water and then it is not cold and I do not have any ice. So it is a couple hours in the fridge before I have cold water again. I highly recommend Brita pitchers, but I would suggest getting a larger one."
2,Quite small,"I like the Brita concept. Water does seem to taste better from Brita, whether or not it's healthier or not. But part of the concept includes having enough water to drink. What good is purification if it only applies to a few cups? That's the problem here. The design is quite narrow. This helps it fit into a fridge door but limits the possible uses. I find that I fill up the pitcher all the way and then use it to fill up my metal water bottle. By that point the pitcher is practically empty. It's tedious to go back and forth to the sink and keep refilling it.I'm left to wonder who this is intended for. Does anyone have such a small fridge or so many food items that they would need to cut down on their Brita pitcher size? I would opt for a larger version."
3,Okay,"It's a little small and doesn't save that much space in my fridge compared to the large one. Also the whole white insert part tends to fall out when you pour the water out, so you have to hold it on. I'll keep it, but would buy the larger one if I were doing it over."
4,Brita Filter - Good!,"This was a good purchase - now I have fresh, clean water without paying by the bottle! Fast and refreshing! Would buy again!"
2,the inner device pops out,I've owned a few Brita pitchers and never had a problem. the only problem i have is that when i pour the water out i have to be careful or the inner plastic device (that holds the filer) falls out. None of our other larger pitchers have this problem so maybe it's because this one is smaller...? not sure. I will be calling them tomorrow and see if this is normal or if it's defective. Water quality is good; i believe i soaked the filter for over 15 minutes.
2,Didn't get what I expected.,"Pros:- No need to buy bottlesCons:- Small... too small for 2 persons, we always need to refill the pitcher, if you drink 4 glasses of water, you will have to refill it.- The water tastes like... the water from the faucet. It seems that it doesn't work. The water still tastes like chlorine, it's really annoying and makes me sick.So far, we will have to buy bottle again...##### EDIT - Monday February 14th #####We have been using it still until we don't have any filters (I don't like to waste)... and we discovered that the cylinder where user put the filter was not totally round. Therefore, the water goes through without being filtered. If not only this would happen, some particles of black things (charcoal ???) go out from the filter by its top... and because the cylinder is not round the particles fall into the pitcher.You can try by yourself to see it in action: Turn the filter so its head is in front of your hand and shake it. You will see that particles are coming out."
4,"Works great, but a bit small","I got this for my dorm room, and for three girls, this pitcher is too small. This one, the smallest available, is too big for tiny dorm fridges, so you might as well get something bigger that'll let you go longer between refills.Otherwise, this worked great. I got this because the water in New Haven is comparable to pool water, and the chlorine taste and smell completely disappears after using the filter. Good stuff."
3,Good product for the cost,"I bought it in a deal for $15 and I am ok with what I have got.Pros: Looks good, light weightCorns: The filter comes out in the filter chamber when I pour water in a glass. Also, the filter itself spits out black particles which require constant cleaning.Overall, its good product for the cost."
4,Best spent 8 bucks,"This Britta filter is amazing! I am having hard trouble with chlorine smell in my drinking water. So read thru the reviews at Amazon and yes, it works teh way it should. Only grivance is, it is tiny. I don't know how many times I have to fill up on these hot sticky summar days. The construction is also looks pretty fragile, I have not dropped it yet but I think it will be dead on touchdown."
1,Poor,I followed the instructions down to a T and each time I pour water inside the filter I keep seeing some black stuff in the top of the filter. I have to keep washing out the top of the filter. At one time I even say some cloudy stuff inside the jug it self. I have been using this filter for three weeks now. I had a Lotus filter before that I bought for half the price and It did a way better job. I am totally disappointed
4,it's good,"this is the perfect size for one person, especially a dorm student.the only complaint i have about it is that the spout is open to the air and the water can take in some of the smell/taste of the foods in your fridge. just something to keep in mind."
3,Does the job,"It filters water fine and fits well into my small refrigerator. Fair warning -- it's small, will only hold about 3 cups of water.My only complaint is that that it could have been designed a bit bitter. There's not a strong catch/lip for the lid so it often lifts up or opens while pouring, creating spills. Sometimes if I hold the lid down, it's top heavy so the whole filter slides out.All in all, is a good product and great for storage. But pouring is sometimes an issue."
5,Good deal for the price!,"We don't have running water so we wanted a pitcher to filter our hand pumped water, and we needed one that was rather small to fit in our rather small refrigerator:-). This little pitcher is great, nice and sturdy and does the job. You have to be patient because it takes a little while for the water to run through and although I did soak the filter like it says, I still have black spots inside the filter chamber...but that's not a problem because it stays in there and doesn't get into the water. I would recommend this pitcher for one or two people but if you drink a lot of water or have a family you might need more than one or get a larger one."
3,it's okay,"This is an okay way to get purified water. The brita filter is fine, but it's the pitcher that doesn't work so well. It only holds so much water (maybe a half gallon) and after you put water in the top to be filtered, you can't move it without spilling water. You just have to put water in the top and let it sit there for a while."
1,HORRIBLE,"this is horrible, just like everyone else said black granules in your water resulting in gray water. be careful, get another brand."
4,Infernal Affairs meets Wall Street,"Great movie. Full of suspense and drama. Think of the movie ""Infernal Affairs"" meets ""Wall Street"" and ""Eagle Eye""."
5,Awesome tripod,"Very solid build, easy to use, awesome price. this is a must have for any photographer. Ive had this for almost a year and its held up very well to some pretty tough abuse."
5,A great sturdy tripod,"A great tripod which can be used for very low heights as well it has the option for a spin of head on the tripod leg top which enables low heights as well, a good one which serves all my purpose, would have been the best option if it would have had a monopod in it as well, in this model which would have made this tripod with almost all the options that would require in a single product."
5,A great book,This is an incredibly moving book that appeals to all women of all ages. An amazing read!
3,Misleading title,"I may have to read this book again in say, 10 or 20 years. Maybe it will make sense then. I must agree that there were some good parts in it. In fact, I did take a few interesting ideas from the book. Overall, an interesting, riveting read it is not. If you view transcending time as akin to traveling through it, this may be a book for you."
4,Time Travel.,"The Yoga of Time Travel is written clear enough for anyone to understand, and will answer most of your questions pertaining to time travel. Once the author explains to you the science and it's limits, when it comes building a time travel machine, he will show you the metaphysical side of time travel.There is no way a book on time travel will satisfy everyone's beliefs. Quantum Physics can only explain so much, and when one starts to write about the spiritual side of time travel, there are just too many beliefs to be able to use the right words to keep everyone happy. In other words, read the book and enjoy the book.Naturally there will be books that go more deeply into Quantum Physics and books that go more deeply into Yoga but this is not what the author is trying to do. He is giving the reader a clear look at where science and metaphysics is at when it comes to time travel. So do like I did, and enjoy it."
1,Horrible,This book was a large disapointment. There was no time for the charachters to develop any sexual tension before they were in bed together. They never had any time (although the book is quite long) to develop into real characters either.Save your money and your time. Buy something else.
3,It is an action figure not a toy.,"The figure is just fine. My daughter wanted it for her room. She loves dragons.But it is hard to review this item because it is not a toy. I mean, come on,""how much fun is this toy?"", it sits there. But my daughter loves it!"
1,Improperly assembled!!!!,"The joker in India that assembled this thing should be fired (yes, it's made in India). The collet was installed backwards in the nut. I'd hate to think of what would happen if someone actually tried to use it as assembled."
4,Decent gun,"Was skeptical, but hopeful. Other reviews were decent and I didn't want to make the mistake of getting a cheaper gun like I had before and being disappointed. Design is par for this type of gun. The pressure wheel is very good for adjusting how much or how little pressure one wants the gun to have. The 2 I bought have been in service for a month now and I am going to purchase another for a spare.Don't bother sending in the registration card...it was returned to us as non deliverable."
3,Nostalgic Fun,I quite liked this. I only vaguely remember the show but on the evidence of these excerpts it was funnier than I thought. It does appear to be extremely well acted.The sound quality is decent but there can be quite long pauses between tracks. It would have been nice to have had a few complete episodes.This is quite enjoyable but with so much `To the Manor Born' episodes being on You Tube it is perhaps not really necessary.
4,My dad had been wanting to see this movie again for many years...,"My daddy had been wanting to see this movie again after seeing it YEARS ago. He actually had it recorded on VHS and it was recorded over many years ago. He was hoping that one day he could just find it again on VHS, but much to his surpprise, I was able to find it for him NEW on DVD! He was quite pleased with the quality and the fact that the price was SOO reasonable and that it got there so quickly. Thank you!! Kudos to the vendor!!!"
3,Eye candy from the golden age of free love,"I actually saw this in a theater when it first came out (ok, I'm old, get over it) and I'd been really curious to see it again. It was just as bad (and good) as I'd remembered.It's just as Austin Powers said: consequence free, unprotected free love. And terrific miniskirts as well. I watch it for the fashions, and Roger Vadim's make-out scenes are more appealing than hard core."
2,The cover is not that great,"When i first got the cover and had it on my macbook it was fine and I loved it. However, when I took the cover off I noticed that the plastic around the edges of my laptop were starting to crack. I think it was from the pressure the case exerted on the laptop. The seller was awesome. I got the product within the estimated shipping dates and was in perfect condition, I would not recommend this product but I would recommend this seller."
1,I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM,I just took my cover off after having it on for 2 weeks and it actually scratched my computer up more than it would have not having a case. Buying this product was a pretty bad decision. I'm so angry right now. My computer was BRAND NEW !!! Now it looks like I dropped my computer on the ground and kicked it around. The only good thing about this product is that it makes the computer look cool. I would not recommend this item to anyone trying to keep their computer looking new.
4,MacBook See-Thru Hard Case,"This is an excellent product; easy to fit and use. I like the fact that it protects my laptop, but provides full accessibility to the computer and ports without undoing any zippers, buckles, or velcro. It's hard plastic so it won't retain any moisture or dirt like neoprene or other padded material. It really enhances mobility of the laptop without adding any bulk. Highly recommended."
1,Just Horrible,"I've had this product for much over a year now but only used it for 3 months. It scratched not only itself but my precious mac computer as well. The precise reason for getting the product inevitable occurred anyway BECAUSE of the product....quite ironic right? I tried to return the product and called millions of times but no one ever answer my call or replied to the numerous voice messages I left. I wanted to share my awful experience with this product with potential buyers. Not only is it not worth the price, it's not even worth 1 stinkin dollar! I've been using one I purchased from ebay for only 10 dollars for almost 4 months now and it's perfect. Word to the wise: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!! UGH!!!! ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!"
3,This case damages the hinge!,"Other reviewers have noted that this case limits the movement of the screen on the Macbook. That's not all. this case damages the hinge itself, and it's happened twice. The first time, I paid Apple $300 to get the screen replaced and got a new case from Speck. I reinstalled the case. After a period of use, the screen would become wobbly because the hinge had become loosened, and I would remove the case to find that the wobbliness would go away. I kept the case on just to protect the MacBook. Today, I noticed that the macbook hinge was actually becoming loose on the left side. I immediately took off the shell. I'm getting a different case."
5,Nice but expensive,"I think this will provide protection from dings on the computer, however it is expensive. I tried to find it elsewhere but Amazon had the best price."
3,Useful,"I really like this product. It fit my computer, snapped right on, and makes it look nice. The colors are bright and fun, and it really helps prevent the scratches that my Mac was getting."
4,Touching Story,"This is the first book that Ive read by Susan Macias. Her writing flows nicely, with the nice touches of humor and steamy sex scenes we romance readers love. Courtney and Matt Stone are literally spun into 1873 by a mystical tornado. There marriage is on the rocks, on the verge of divorce, and what could make two opposites more overwhelmed? Correct!! Going from microwave ovens to montrous black cook stoves. :) I thought Courtney and Matt's story was sweet, two lovers discovering that there is more to a relationship than just sex. I liked Courtney, though at times she did act a bit selfish. But the great thing about it, was that she admitted she was selfish and apologized for it. Matt is the typical cowboy. He couldn't be happier to be in the Wild West. But dealing with his wife who can't boil water is an adventure that can't be missed. If you want a nice love story, with a blend of humor and humility, this is it!!!"
4,RollerCoaster Tycoon,fun game but hard after being at one park . do not do mission at first. and get a lot of Mechanics to fix the park. after all it's a fun game
4,Good gayviators for the $,They are certainly worth the $3 I paid for them. Thinking about buying a couple more just in case I break these ones. They are a bit flimsy and the plastic ear parts seem loose like they might fall off. But for the $ they are great. Buy some.
5,everything i wanted out of them,great stuff just what i wanted and on the cheap. They are full mirror just like they say.
4,Sun Glasses,My grandson was very pleased with these glasses. They are sturdy and he hasn't managed to break them yet. Recommend this vendor.
3,aviator sunglasses,"Delivery was timely, product was in good shape. Glasses are nice but joints for earpieces are weak and bend easily, wear with care."
4,Excellent for the price.,"I bought these back when they were only $6 for two pairs, and if needed, I would purchase them again at the current price, $12 for two pairs. The pair I received were in perfect condition -- they're heavy (but not so much on the face), a nice, classic shape for both males and females, and good for keeping the sun out without any glare. If I remember correctly, they also came with a little storage bag that I've lost, which was a nice touch."
4,Good Cheap Glasses,"These glasses look really good. The lenses are pretty big so it might look weird on people with small faces. The quality of the frames are also very good for something so cheap. Sometimes the glasses slip down my face a few centimeters but its not a big deal. These glasses really do not appear as cheap as they are and I get a lot of compliments on them. The view wearing the glasses is VERY DARK!!!! Almost too dark in fact. I live in South FL so the normal sunny days are fine but if its overcast or late in the afternoon I sometimes have to take these off. Overall these are really great glasses that look good. And if you lose or sit on them, no biggie just order another pair."
3,Alrighttt,When I got these sunglasses they were a little bit broken on the top right lens...you can't notice it unless I point it out so I still wear them all the time. Regardless if you can notice it or not I would have liked it if they were actually in perfect condition when I got them.
5,BUENO!!,"EXCELENTE PRODUCTO, MUY BUENA LA MARCA Y TOTALMENTE IGUAL COMO EL REQUERIMIENTO Y EL ENVIO FUE PUNTUAL Y ADEMAS DE ESTO EL PRODUCTO LLEGO EN MUY BUENAS CONDICIONES!!!MUCHAS GRACIAS!!"
1,Aviator Review,I did not like the product and am waiting for my refund. I will still purchase other items from Amazon but will not purchase anything from Knextion again.
3,Pretty good buy,"The glasses were pretty good. They were sturdy and very comfortable. They shipped within the correct shipping time and I have been enjoying them every sense I unpacked them. The only real flaw I have found with them is that they scratch pretty easly, but for the price they are worth every penny."
4,Satisfied ( and surprised),"I bought a lesser quality pair of aviator glasses and was not satisfied, Seller sent me 2 more pairs at no cost, very nice ones indeed. Thanks so much great service!!!! quick and friendly"
3,Pretty Generic,Pretty cheaply made. But they block the sun well and fit pretty comfortably. They work well as long as you aren't hoping they'll pass for an expensive pair
2,Mirror coating disapearing.,"I ordered three pairs of these sun glasses and the first pair are losing their mirror coating. I will throw these away and try the second pair today. I hope the second pair lasts longer. Oh well, if not, they were not too expensive."
4,"Good Product, Great Service",The Glasses where perfect for creating the costume effect that i was going for! Not to mention the great customer service i got from the seller in making sure i got exactly what i orderd.
3,"Great price, very dark lenses, esp. for nighttime","For the price, these were a good value. They were really a dark lens underneath the mirror so there was no way to wear them during the night time, which was a bummer for Trick or Treating. Otherwise, fun glasses!"
1,"Ouch! Steam, Hot!!","The prior reviews are on target. Just adding emphasis here.This product is a booby-trap.You will need an oven mitt to pour your tea water. Otherwise you will be scalded with the steam. Period.Trust me, the beauty of this product drops precipitously with each use.Save yourself!!"
3,TEA KETTLE,"THE COLOR WAS A DULL PINK, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A PEPTOBISMOL COLOR PINK, SO I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED. I LIKE THE SHAPE AND IT LOOKS TO BE A NICE ONE."
3,Whee!,"Instant early Pulp collection! Fun! I already own all these albums individually, but if you don't, you might as well have 'em all at once. To sum up: It is nice, in a naive sort of way; Freaks has many bland songs but also real flashes of brilliance, Being Followed Home in particular; Masters of the Universe is mediocre at best, and Separations is brilliant. I kinda wish they would've included some of the really obscure tracks that are virtually impossible to find otherwise here, but it's all good. There's plenty of great music in this set."
3,Misleading title,They items are as described. But the title is misleading. There should be no mention of the 72 ea/case if they are only selling them as a 6 pack.
1,Not 72 In A Case------6 in a case. That's alll you get.,I felt ripped off when I bought three of these cartons expecting 72 of the paper mask filters in each box as the label implies-------- 72 EA/Case [PRICE is per EACH]There are small boxes with only 6 of these disposable filters that can be used a few times at most. It becomes an expensive alternative. The filter isn't particularly more sophisticated to make than a coffee filter. I also had trouble finding these anywhere. So now after I dropped all this cash I'm looking at other types of personal protection equipment for dust.The mask/respirator works great and you need to replace these filters frequently. But there are other brands and types of dust protection. How can you advertise 72 in a case and then deliver 6.BOGUS!
5,The story continues...,"I loved seeing what happened after the Happy Golden Years, which left me wondering what happened next. In today's uncertain times, sometimes it is just so comforting to curl up on the couch with a LIW book and enjoy a story of simpler times. There were hardships, to be sure, but not the scary problems we face today. I loved reading about Laura and Almanzo starting their family together. I guess my only complaint is that I wished it had been a little longer."
4,Gordan wood and his modality of his book,the modality of this book can be applie shown through the pre revolution eutopia and the capital forming effects of millitry mobilization. But wood draciticy underestamates the socila dicintinctions of the wealthy and eapeacially the inherited wealth. This therefore shows his lack of ability to reconize the ignorant shown through his previous aligtions of other forming effets of the book.BUT HEY IM JUST A KID
5,Extraordinarily insightful,"I echo the previous comments. While brief, the book delves deeply into the ""Whys"" of the Revolution. The first 50-60 pages alone, which summarize the events, are worth the read...but don't stop there. Dr. Wood really hits his stride in the subsequent 100+ pages.Very well done."
3,Disappointing,"This book is interesting for the tidbits about the things to consider when moving, but it's very outdated. Italy has been using the Euro for what, 10 years? Every time ""lire"" was mentioned, I cringed. The timeframe for obtaining a Visa is days/weeks; definitely not 9 months. In summary, as I prepare to move to Italy I don't know how much I can depend on the contents of the book."
2,pointer not level,"My problem with the compass is that the pointer end is weighed down with the paint that marks the north-pointing tip so that if the compass is on a level table, the tip touches the bottom of the compass. You have to hold the compass at a tilt to keep the indicator parallel with the bottom surface. If you want to set it down so the need settles, you have to use something to prop up one side so the needle does not rest against the bottom causing it not to work."
3,Find CD of ' Alive She Cried' instead,"contains amazing version of 'Gloria', john sebastian joins doors on harmonica, on 'little red rooster' - you are tranported..wonderful.Jim talks...that's all you really need..."
1,3m pistol,"This tape dispenser is very hard to use. The tape gets stuck on the metal end of the dispenser every time, and it does not flow freely, so you have to constantly pull the ""stuck on"" tape away from the metal piece before it will release the tape. It does not do what I think it should. This is not a good machine."
3,Sticky Tape Dipenser,The only issue I have with this dispenser is that the tape is always sticking to the tape guide. When it is not sticking to the tape guide it works great.
4,I liked it,It fits the upper ear lobe perfectly. No pain and you dont have to take it off when going to bed. Good one!
5,Spectacular. Tried the Visual Quickstart Guide before this,"This book is a gem! The information is well written, with a great balance of visual and narrative information. The lessons are wonderfully easy to follow and even presented in nice 1 hour chunks. If you like a hands-on approach this book is highly recommended. I tried Visual Quickstart before reading this book and I was exasperated by the choppy narrative that left me feeling either over qualified or underqualified, but never just right. The Macromedia book has done wonders to recover me from that abyss."
3,Average book,"This book is okay if you are trying to learn something on your own and need step by step instructions. By no means is this a reference book for dreamweaver or xhtml.I dont have anything bad to say about the book, but theres nothing unique or intuitive about it either."
1,great look for halloween,"Looks like what your well dressed fashionista witch would wear on her feet. A very long, very pointy toe makes the shoe look like it belongs to a costume found at your local I-party store.It was marked down for a reason-be afraid, be very afraid!"
2,San Diego Padres Cap,It was not the correct hat. It didn't specify that it was a round snapback hat. In the picture it looked like a curved brim cap.
4,One fine tune after another,"Darden simply doesn't put enough music into the marketplace. If only we could get a CD this good every year - what a wonderful world it would be. This may be a little more mainstream than his earlier work (he even cut his hair for the cover photo), but like everything he does he makes it work. Don't think about it, don't read any more reviews, don't even check your bank balance, just buy it, listen to it, sing along, and realize that real emotion does exist for a rare few and at least one of those people can put it to music."
1,"empty book about a mean, obnoxious, lousy woman","I found this book superficially funny and superfically insightful, but nothing more. The lead character is the most un-woman woman in thought and deed that I have read in recent years. It's as if she is a man with a wig on. Nothing in her motives and her ""funny"" relationship with her Daddy (they're in love) rings true. I couldnt make it through this one and don't recommend it. I hoped to enjoy it being from the bay area, but no dice."
1,what's the point?,"This is funny at certain points, but what's the point of writing this? And reading it? A satirical look at ambition, and superficiality is the point, so you can't hold it responsible for being flat? It's a waste of time and reading energy. I'm bored with writers who write books with the ""I'm too smart for any moral conviction except that of my own intellectual superiority"" position. Doing nothing, saying nothing, is boring. What's the point?"
5,BRILLIANT BROADWAY CAST!,"I HAPPENED TO BUY ""THE WILL ROGERS FOLLIES"" BY CHANCE, AND NOW IT IS ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE BROADWAY CAST RECORDINGS(AND I HAVE A LOT OF THEM, AS ANY MUSICAL-FAN WOULD HAVE)!THE PERFORMANCES ARE GREAT, WITH GREAT ORCHESTRATIONSAND SOUND. FOR ME THIS IS A CLASSIC! HIGHLY RECOMMENDABLE!"
4,Wish I could take this trip,"Andrew Eames a British journalist recounts his travels by train in 2002 from London to Baghdad. He replicates the journey that Agatha Christie took back in 1928. Eames interweaves the account of his own adventures in the tumultuous Middle East with Christie's life story, providing background on the culture and history of the places en route. This is an interesting travelogue that is informative and worth reading."
3,"Bar is great, just don't order online","I love these bars, they taste just like candy bars. I put in an order for them and was extremely disappointed in the condition they were in. The choclate was supposed to be milk choclate, but looked like it had been melted and was white and chaulky. The caramel had melted in them and reformed at the end of each bar. They were horrible. The only good part was that customer service re-credited my credit card the full price for all of them. Like I said...these bars are normally REALLY good, but I recommend buying them at a store like SAMS, NOT online. As far as flavor goes I would have given 5 stars, but do to the condition they were in I only gave 3 stars"
4,Does the job and priced well!,"I'm not sure if some reviewers received a different model than I did, but I'm sure happy with my fitting tool. It feels sturdy to me and has a nice heft to it. No build issues here. It took me all of two minutes to fit my frame, and doing so couldn't have been easier. The sliding foot does rotate a bit, so parts aren't perfectly parallel and in symmetry with the frame. If you're hopelessly OCD and don't like the foot rotation, then this might bother you, but, in actual execution, the results are quite nice. I also appreciate that the tool came with points, so I didn't have to run out to my garage to get brads."
4,"Important, compelling work","This is meaningful work in a genre that has, for the most part, ignored our gay and lesbian experience. I hope the author will continue to research this subject area and publish her results. I believe there is a big demand for more information about gay and lesbian near death experiences, both scientific and anecdotal."
2,Unsatisfying,I really didn't care for this book and couldn't finish reading it all. Reading near death incidents is unpleasant and disturbing. The stories were sketchy and choppy and poorly written; some made no sense--explanations were often lacking. It still doesn't say why we are all here and why we have to go through all this on the physical plane.
5,"If you only buy one ASP book, make it this one.","Many teachers and books have put me to sleep while droning on and on about every little detail of a language -- not this book. This book is great! It provides chapter after chapter of real, full-blown web applications. You get to see real-life examples at work and see how they are implemented. You see the tricks of building real applications.In addition, the first two chapters give you an overview of the concepts involved so you have just the right amount of information that you need to start understanding the scripts right off the bat."
1,Excessively simplistic,"This book would only be useful to ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS.The applications are excessively simple, and the explanations are long.As a professional ASP programmer I bought this book for the ASP code, hoping to fond some to short-cut my own development, and learn some more along the way. NO WAY. The applications are excessively simple - not even worthwhile as a foundation for adding your own code.Wrox Press' Professional series are still the best in my opinion."
1,Stay away!,"This book is jumpy, and makes very rough and incomprehensive transitions from simple topics to more complicated ones. Very inconsistant, and often times, incorrect use of terms, which can really throw you off when you're trying to learn a programming language. The worst part is that the author does not explain many parts of the code that for some reason, he assumes you already know. One thing I've learned from these reviews, is to not just look at the rating, but also reviews that cover aspects that are important to you. The high ratings from this book came mostly from more experienced programmers that just needed a reference or some quick scripts. The bad reviews came mostly from begginers who quickly turned away by the author's vague tone. Judging by the title, and even the first chapter, this book markets itself as a beginner's tool which it is not. I picked up Sams Teach Yourself Active Server Pages in 21 Days, and it's a much better publication."
4,buen sonido,Aunque es dificil la instalacion de los drivers. tuve que desintalar los drivers creative de mi X-fi xtreme music (que son los mismos) para que pueda reconocerla. El sonido es de lo mejor con mis logitech Z 5300.
3,opt for the cheaper model,"Quality of construction, of sound, and features are what I've come to expect from Creative. Installation is simple, ten minutes and you're ready to go. Suffers from Creative's well known bloated software package, you may want to install just the drivers. But - you're paying a premium price for 64meg of ""XRam"" which is not even used unless your game or app is programmed to access it; and there are very, very few developers who've pursued this. Opt instead for one of the lower level X-Fi cards; same features, same sound, no XRam, much cheaper. I would have awarded the full five stars if the XRam was functional for all apps."
4,Superior sound,All I can say is that this card makes a huge difference in sound coming from your pc. I listen to a lot of instrumental music and it feels like I'm standing at the conductor's position listening to each sound the insturment makes. Of course I have a logitech z-5500 5.1 HD surround sound.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this utensil drying rack to go with the small stainless steel sink drainer. The size and appearance are perfect, but my spoons, forks and knives all slip right through the open slots on each corner, and pulling them back out is not easy. It's so aggravating I quit using it, and am looking for a different model."
1,Disappointing,I have had this for four months and while it fits perfectly it is already rusting at all the places where the metal crosses. Need to get another one that won't rust. Not worth the money.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,This product begins to rust at each connection point in the grid that forms the basketThis will happen in just a couple of weeks use....
2,this item needs more competition,"First of all it is small, and secondly the flatware falls through on both ends because it is not closed well on the corners. If you want to throw away $8, this is a good way to do it. Otherwise, the product is non tarnishing and seems to be all right"
2,Relief Valve Failed,"I have a unit made by Gilmour for ""DoItBest"" Model 2D1B. I have had for only 6 months and the relief valve failed. I tried to take it off and it appeared to damage the fixed side threads that are part of the screw on lid/pump assembly. I am not sure how or where to get a replacement part(s) , assuming they are available."
1,just bad,"The song you hear on the radio is the only good one, in my opinion this cd sucks. just not my style maybe."
5,Skyrockets in the night,"a work that delighfully pries open rigid brain cells, stimulates them to expand marvelous new synapses and leaves the reader brimming with revolutionary ideas.Unusual, unique, elegantly researched but hope-filled theorized notions that will rock your world. Sitchin takes you into the outer limits and you become the better for it.Very entertaining reading."
2,Nothing but theory and stretching to make a connection,"I dont know how any of the reviews that I read that made me buy this book could of possibably be talking or reviewing this book. Its awful, it makes long stretches to ""try"" and make a connection to the writings of the sumeritians to that which our current science fields theorizes but has no way of actually knowing...a hypothesis of many varieties that none even make sense or a connection. And, mind you, very little ancient sumerian text or comparision to text is offered. Really, this book is nonsense, only sad I bought another of his books, I'm sure it is as un-enlightening as this one is. People, write reviews after you've read the book because I'm telling you, the majority of the reviews are complete bogus- after you read the book you will feel like somebody is taking ""selling- artistic liberties"" and have not even opened a page in the book."
3,"Fun to think about, but...",I saw this book as a way of speeding up the process of getting through Sitchin's ideas as the prospect of reading the full series was a bit daunting - and I love to read! My previous experience with his books were of very dense prose not exactly easy to read. Lots of material. This book is a bit quicker and less intense. Not that Sitchin doesn't present his usual evidence and theories. I enjoy allowing my mind to take up his ideas but there always seem to be a point where he makes a jump of reasoning. Not that he's necessarily wrong. It's just that the presentation of evidence doesn't necessarily continue up to the point of making a conclusion. Too bad the book is even now significantly dated in terms of interstellar developments.
4,Brubeck,I purchased this album after a fellow Red Cross Volunteer I was working with recommended it. I Love this album.
5,"A beautiful, moving novel","I was happy to see that Belmondo Style is a finalist for The Publishing Triangle's 2005 Fiction Award. I read Adam Berlin's novel last summer and thought it a powerful book, one that has stayed in my head long after I finished it. An anti-gay hate crime is the catalyst for this moving novel between a live-for-the-moment father and his thoughtful sixteen-year-old son. These are fascinating characters with a bond that breaks easy father/son cliches. I hope the award nomination renews interest in this beautiful, layered novel."
1,WARNING: NOT A 'ROCK' CLIMBING GUIDE,This is not an actual review of the book. Thought this was a rock climbing guide. It's not haha =D
2,Poor reading,"Very redundant. I found myself reading the same exact text from one chapter that had been cut and pasted to another chapter. Good section on EEC-IV computers, but lacking in actual real tuning for performance."
2,Bones,"Let's start on a high note: the cover is beautiful, the title is intriguing, the concept fascinating. The bones of a great tale are here but it is woefully lacking in meat. I persevered to the end, slogging through pages that were boring; full of disjointed and trite narration and dialoge, hoping to find a reason to like Runcie's offering. Disappointed, I closed the cover and put it in the 'donate to the library book sale' box. Someone should take Runcie's idea and run with it. The potential for a great book lies within."
3,it's ok,"With the admittedly beautiful cover and enticing-sounding quotes on the back, I too was expecting so much more from this.Fortunately I know nothing about the background, so the inaccuracies didn't bother me, but the characters are flat, the dialogue is unnatural, and the examination of religeon is lacking in depth and adds little to the story. The whole first section is unecessary. It's enjoyable enough to read, but little more than that."
1,It is not even a song!,"Its a poem set to a techno beat, not a song. Also it is simple every day wisdom anyone except the stupid don't know."
5,UT2004 Rocks,I must say that I have been playing UT2004 for some time and the multiplayer and multiplayer AI is the best I have seen yet. I give it two... three... maby five thumbs up.
1,Yawn,"Very pretty, but as usual, gameplay suffers. Nothing new here. They ruined the sniper rifle by having smoke blind you whenever you shoot it. And the zoom sucks. Personally, I'm sticking with UT 1999. Like Quake 2, if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
1,Tape was old and adhesive dried out,Both rolls of tape appeared to be ancient. Most of the adhesive was dried out and stuck to the upper layer. Not usable.
3,Eeeh,its just heavy duty hvac tape. I wouldnt trust it to seal an exhaust flue on anything. On a clothes dryer duct it would be perfect
2,"not exactly happy, bad batch maybe??","I purchased this and used it on my pellet stove pipes. It's good tape but did not come off the roll evenly leaving some of the adhesive stuck to the outside of the tape. Could be because of the product sitting around I suppose. None the less it works and did the job.EDIT: So I was trying to use the rest of this roll and well I can't actually..... because the tape is only sticky in spots and in spots it isn't the adhesive is stuck to the top of the roll underneath. This makes it difficult to come of the roll with getting little ""peices parts"" I am not sure that it's the tapes fault but believe it's either a bad batch or possibly an old batch. Unfortunately I need this tape for my pellet stove so now I have to buy more even though I have half a useless roll left. ARRRGH."
2,a bit light weight,"I bought these as a Christmas present for my son. He usually likes heavy tee-shirts, so I fear he won't like these. The material is very thin. I suppose if he wants to wear long sleeves on warmer days, he can wear these, but I am disappointed in the quality."
1,Avoid. Useful only as a coaster!,"This book is long on wind and low on useful information. Most info can be found in the how-to's. This is not a well written book and is hard to follow at times, and somewhat disjointed. If you want a good Linux book, keep looking. This book will take a major rewrite before it is useful to both the master and the newbie."
2,RedHat Linux 6 server,"Poorly written..,IDG does a very poor job of control quality. Typo's are apparent through out the book. The direction of the author is unclear he rambles into examples without indicating what the hell file he would like you to edit! The WEB server chapter is very poorly written. I have not found anything in this chapter that may help the beginner in displaying web pages. Mohammed J. Kabir assumes that you have compiled html pages already! This is my first and last IDG book.., they are poorly written and offer little information for real network professionals."
1,Look elsewhere...,"This book is so bad I don't know where to begin. FIrst, it fails to be an adequate description of, or encomium for, jury trials. (For that, see Jeffrey Abramson's book, WE THE JURY.) Second, it fails to apply real jurisprudence (like Lon Fuller or HLA Hart) to this ""new"" area of thought, and it fails pathetically to mix in critical theory. (Why is Hannah Arendt thrown into nearly every paragraph?) I regret that I didn't click on the ""look inside"" feature of this website. Two pages of nonsense would have been enough. Save your money, save your time, by ignoring this brain-dead drivel."
3,Loss Of Voice In DVD,It was ok the voice on the dvd drops out halfway through it and it says nothing.
4,California's Red Light District,"Fascinating documentary on SF's underbelly, the Barbary Coast, the Storyville of California. A must-know for California history and for residents of the Golden State."
5,Brilliant,"A great book, easy to read, savage, bitter, ironical, distrubing, and wickedly funny. Fantastic. I recommend it to anyone open to the world and interested in a fresh new voice."
4,Delivers the Goods,"The internal balance of Bass and Treble meets my needs. My IPOD Touch slips right in and doesn't jiggle. The ease and quality were a great match for my desire to port one system about the office, back porch and into my room when travelling."
5,Magnificent!,"Emma Donoghue's latest collection of short stories is extraordinary. Each story is a perfectly polished gem, with the depth of characterization and emotion that you would expect from a great novel. And she's funny, too. Donoghue captures the family, with all its pain and humor, and her wry and compelling observations on relationships are not to be missed. If AOL allowed it, I would give this collection ten stars."
1,"Disappointing, poorly written","After reading positive reviews on this book I was looking forward to reading it. I was very surprised to find the quality of the writing so utterly lacking. A high school honors english class has better writing skills than this. And the synopsis at the end of each story?? ::rolls eyes:: Please spare me the ""life lessons"". Frankly, its simply corny. I dont expect stories of this sort to be Proust, but this is downright terrible. I can not recommend this in good faith. Do yourself a favor and pass!!!"
1,Wrong Data on CD- Sucks,"I ordered this CD and it was new in the package. It said ""Word Smart"" but it contained Grammar Smart COntent. I was very dissapointed because it was for my middle school. We needed it in an urgent manner. Please do not order this on CD. maybe Casette will be better. I like Grammar smart, but I wanted Word Smart."
2,You'll be sorry!,"This unanimity of opinion about this movie duped me into buying it. Big mistake.This movie boggles the mind: no plot, no story even, no characters, nothing. Will she marry James Garner? Well, of course, she's going to marry James Garner! He's James Garner! Maybe you have to be a fan.Well, I like Sally Field a lot, but she had no role worth playing in this slice of life. Slice of life is a hard enough thing to pull off, but when you pick such a dull life, it's a joke.My advice: talk to someone you trust before you put your money on this movie."
