5,A wonderful cd,"This is a lovely collection by Luciana Souza. To me she is like Monica Salmaso, a curator of wonderful songs. Every song is elegantly presented and the liner notes are helpful in conveying the meaning to those of us who are linguistically challenged. Luciana Souza's intelligence and the beauty of her work is the antidote to the ""American Idol"" style of singing that sells so well, but means so little. It is music for grown-ups."
3,Nice,"I prefer Rosa Passos. Luciana's voice has an uneven tone throughout most of this collection. She has a nice ability to do brief scats, but to my ear they do not add much musically, sounding more like technical agility than musical expression. Somehow the album lacks soulfulness."
5,More than expected,I have always liked Kansas so I bought this one. However upon viewing and listening it has surpassed all my expectations
1,Elvis Crapello,"I don't know. I loved EC and I loved country...I even went to see him on the tour afterwards...what a waste of my precious time back then...and of my money. This is self-indulgent and badls played...I do not understand the point really. Buy some real country instead...George Jones, Johnny Cash, anything instead..."
1,MONGOOSE GREATNESS TO FAILURE,"I grew up with Mongoose BMX bikes- remember the ones you could crash through the trees on and it would be just fine?Mongoose!! Where have you gone?I gave this item to my son one week ago.satisfied that it would be great, it is after all a Mongoose.NOPE!THREE DAYS LATER it is broken.The pedals fell off a few times, and it was nearly impossible to assemble correctly (it appears to go together, only to find they are not at the right angles). Then, the axle and shafts do not connect right. spins, no wheel action. I am told it needs to be welded or replaced. Both cost as much as the unicycle!!!seat is also VERY uncomfortable for boys/young men (girls as well, but much worse for boys). Replaced with a Torker Unistar- excellent alternatative!!!Initially, Amazon charged me 20% of the cost in order to return the defective merchandise, after a scolding, they immediately refunded the restocking fee, with sincere apologies."
2,ehhh,"this was good when i first started riding but not for long. everything on it is made out of pot metal so the threading on the crank to the pedal literally shredded off. the cranks on mine started falling off. its a nice design and i like the big wheel but trust me people, dont be sucha tight wad n get yourself something a little better or youll regret it."
2,You get what you pay for,"I received one as a gift; I am looking forward to using it, however it arrived with a defective tire tube and the directions were useless. A part is being shipped and the customer service was acceptable. It is also quite heavy."
4,im too short...,"its hard for my to ride because my leg all the way up to my knee is too short, other then that its great and i can ride really far, i love the big wheel, just not the way the the four squid things hit my knee(only because im too short)this unicycle is gret if your over 5ft and only want it to ride dstances(oraround your driveway)hope this review was helpful btw im 13,and short"
5,WURLITZER FREAK,TOM HAS PASSED ON BUT HIS MUSIC WILL LIVE ON.HIS BEST AND WILDEST CD IS ECHO OF MINN. EVER HEARD DIXIEPLAYED ON 32' BASE TUBES. HOUSES SHAKING.I MEET TOM A THE CAPTAIN GALLY PIZZA IN REDWOOD CITYAND GOT UNRELEASED ALBUM SIGN BY HIM. HE WAS SHOCKED IHAD ONE.I WOULD SAY IF YOU LOVE THE MIGHTY WURLITZER YOU WON'TGO WRONG WITH TOM PLAYING IT.
5,super book,great excercises for dexterity. it's no wonder this book is recommended.this book will make you a better trumpeter/cornetist.
4,good,hardto find in the stores- and the product was what they said and arrived in good time and in good shape
5,Movies,Both these movies are wonderful - not just the silly stuff that seems to be the trend now a days.
2,not as informative as one might wish,"I thought that this book would tell me about safe places, particularly beaches, where dogs are permitted to run off leash. Instead, it tells, in overblown prose and for some reason always referring to the dog as ""she,"" where one may walk one's dog ON a leash. I don't need a book for this information. There are some beaches in Florida where dogs are allowed to run. I know this because I eventually found some of them myself. This book was not a help."
2,Poorly Listed,"I'm sure this throat plate is fine for the correct saw, but Amazon has poor lableing. I had to return it. Listing it as the insert for 'Delta Contractors Saws' is an error. It fits right-tilt contractors saws, not left tilt. The left-tilt contractors saw throat plate is listed as the one for left-tilt Delta Unisaw, but is the right item for their left tilt contractors saw as well."
5,Indigenizing the Indigenous,"Taiaiake Alfred presents a thought prevoking and straight forward critique of today's aboriginal politics. Filled with understanding, insight, and challenging thoughts, he states the facts in a clear and honest manner. This book is a must read for everybody, especially those wanting a better understanding of traditional aboriginal politics and thought."
3,Novice to Digital,"This is really my first digital and I have only had it a couple of weeks. However I find the delay between when I press the button and when the picture is taken far too long. It averages 6 seconds on auto and 2 or more on the sports setting, which I am told is as fast as it gets. By this time my kids are halfway down the block. I have a lot of pictures of my yard, empty doorways, and blank walls. At least I know I have to take the picture again because I can view it immediately, but somethings can not be repeated. Is this delay normal for other cameras...?"
2,This is a later edition that took out all the good dirty parts!!,"Good factual stuff and very well-written, but:I read the original hardcover a while ago and it was full of raunchy sex, and lots of it--men, women, cats and dogs. and more men. and women.this is a later edition I got for my partner and all the gay sex has been taken out. Mick must have made a monetary offer the author couldn't refuse.oh well."
5,Best cards I've ever sent!,"Lighten up--to the one who claims to be an insulted ""Christian"" by the 12 Dogs of Chistmas cards. For Pete's Sake, these cards were recommended to me by one of the nicest Christians I know! The card with the Maltese as the baby Jesus is just precious. The message I get from these cards is that God loves his animals too. (Especially the Maltese!) Since I have a Maltese who looks exactly like the one on this card, it's the perfect card for us to send. Everyone who knows me knows that I love my dog more than *just about* anything else in this world. This Christmas, these are the perfect cards to send to your dog loving friends & to your friends who know you love your dog. Wise Christians will not be insulted in the slightest."
2,Shoulda read the reviews first....,"It has been a while since I laughed this hard...The 'Various Artists' names are in tiny faint print on the back of the CD... I expected a tribute record, but got a tribute band :)They do a decent job, and I actually learned a few words that I had never been able to pick out from the original versions.Worth a listen, but not $13."
2,not various artists,"One thing i would like to say is that this is not various artists. It is 5 or 6 guys playing their favorite beastie boys songs. i give them creadit for trying and being pretty good at it but it just sounds like a crappy karioke version of these songs, And the scratching! I tell you what, i can do the scratches in these songs better than their DJ. One good thing about it is that it made me want to listen to the real B-Boys more."
4,Compensation Book,"I am very pleased with the service and product. The book was in good condition at a great price, and arrived in a couple of days after placing order. Used book had minimal highlights. Shopping Amazon has been the best way for me to purchase school books at a great price."
4,About time,About time a man's t-shirt proclaims his love for his geek girlfriend...and not the other way around. I bought this for my boyfriend for fun and he wears it quite often. The quality of the shirt is good; the writing is clear; overall a good quality t-shirt.
2,Meh,While the shirt was the correct size and my wife loved it. The shirt started coming a part at the bottom after being washed one time. It continues to do so every time it is washed/dryed. So i'm not happy with the quality of the product i got.
2,"Great knife, but tip broke off after one month","We were amazed at how great this knife was at the price! But about a month after owning it, the tip of the knife broke off! Spend the extra money and get the more expensive version."
5,Great knife,"good blade, solid handle, have put it thru everything from butter to frozen burger.. still know need to sharpen."
1,no rating - really cheap chinese product,"i ordered 2 of these after having a similar kind but of a better quality made in Italy. Both did not have the spill proof valve that is usually on the other end of the shut-off clamp and the liquid just leaks. What in the world are they selling incomplete/mal-functioned products. I have not been able to use mine since I got it a few months back. So annoying and a waste of money.I will not even give this a 1 star, basically it is off the rating list."
2,Could be better,"The concept was good... but the outcome was bad....like someone mentioned below, the flow control vault tend to leak, there is nothing you can do about it....suction cup is not as strong as you think, once you filled up with 2 litter of water, it cannot hold the weight of the bag.the plastic part where it can hook to the suction cup is not strong as well, well break easily..."
3,Pretty Good. Even If It's A Fake.,"""Area 51- The Alien Interview"" is a tape I rented at the local Public Library just out of interest (besides, at the library rentals are free, no loss of money). Maybe I don't buy the actual alien tape, but I thought the documentary as a whole was pretty well done and kind of creepy. The mixture of documentary footage, dramatizations, video and film is really good and makes the movie kind of more interesting and exciting to watch. I also liked the creepy conspiracy theories that have some of that X-Files lore, even if they weren't exactly believable. Also, ""Area 51- The Alien Interview"" is vastly superior to ""Alien Autopsy: Fact Or Fiction?"" which was more hogwash than this any day. At least this tape made the theories and scenerios believable in a creepy way, ""Alien Autopsy"" was just too bogus. In the end, this isn't a ""great, great"" video, but it's nice to watch to kill boredom. I didn't love it, but I liked it."
5,Very real footage,"This is some of the best Alien footage I have seen. The documentary itself has good writers. The only thing I didn't like were the re-enactments. There is a part in the video, where victor says ""This interview is terminated"" and he gets up. You can see part of his face out of the shadow it was in.Very good video. Highly reccomended!"
2,"Slow, slow slow","What more can I say (the title says it all). The best thing about this modem is the USR iBand software allows you to see the Tx/Rx info so that you can tell how slow this thing is. Is there really a modem in the box. The iBand software allows me to appreciate how much faster my Apple USB modem is, and that thing is no speed demon. Glad, that I only blew $15."
5,Fascinating and unusual portrait of a usually hidden group,"I first saw this exhibition in Madrid in summer 2002 and could not forget the images on display, so I was delighted to learn that a book was in print and available on Amazon. This is not just a photo book--though the photographs are amazing in and of themselves--it is social commentary of a most unusual sort. Yes, one hears about the decadent wealthy Mexicans, ten of whom are on the Forbes 400 list, but to actually see them in person, revelling in such lavish surroundings, is quite astounding.I would say, though, that this isn't only about Mexicans--it is about rich people. These images could just as easily have been shot in Hungary, in Hong Kong, or in New York City. To me the interesting thing is how similarly the wealthy live, regardless of where they are."
3,The Chevrolet of cabinet saws,"THis is a good, solid saw at a very competitive price. It is much better than the older Deltas. Stll, it just doesn't stack up to the Powermatic, the General, or other saws that cost s few hundred dollars more. The table milling is average, arbor tilt mechanism is pretty good, belt connection to blade is prone to gathering dust and slipping during heavy use. The best features of this saw are the excellent laminated table extensions and the Biesmeier fence. Overall, this is s good saw for home or school shops, but it doesn't have the weight, solidity, acuracy, or refinement that you'd want for serious can=binet work or production runs. Oh, and the Delta mobile base is very very good and stable."
1,False and dangerous advertising,"The description for the product leads you to believe it is ""milk free"". Having a severe milk allergy, that is the primary reason I purchased it. When it arrived, I looked at the ingredients. The cocoa is listed as ""may contain soy and/or MILK. If I hadn't read the label, and used the protein powder, I would have gotten very sick. PLEASE, if you have a milk allergy, or wish to stay away from dairy, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
3,Looses out on Power+Glory and Octopus,"It's too smooth, the pleasurable edge of Power+Glory or Octopus is missing."
5,Elvis Costello's heyday,"In my book, this album embodies one of the summits in Elvis Costello's career (he would have several successful 'comebacks' later on). Catchy melodies (though not all the way through), lush arrangements, overall musical and artistic exuberance. And the songs like 'Everyday I Write The Book', 'Element Within Her', and 'Shipbuilding' (with its sultry trumpet) are veritable gems, by a long shot."
3,"elvis' most ""80s"" album....","....and that's not a compliment. good tunes, for the most part, and lots of energy -- but it just hasn't aged well. go back and look at your old high school yearbook picture and all the funny haircuts and you'll know what i'm trying to say here...."
2,Fluffy and abrasive,"Aside from the beautiful ""Shipbuilding"", and the awkwardly endearing political tract ""Pills and Soap"", this album has nothing to offer worth listening to. The bulk of the writing is terrible, and the TKO Horns are abrasive.The song ""The Element Within Her"" is perhaps the worst song to appear on any of Elvis Costello's albums. The chorus of ""La la la la la la la"" is enough to send shivers up my spine.Worthwhile for the completist, anyone else would be well advised to avoid this CD -- it is the weakest of all Costello's albums. Consider it an expensive CD-Single for ""Shipbuilding"" and ""Pills and Soap""."
5,Extraordinary,"For a person who loves classical music but is not a musician, I particularly enjoyed the book. I found the introductions to each division and summaries after each contributor extremely helpful. Aside from the content of the text, I very much liked the Picasso cover."
4,Nice Pen for the Wacom Tablets,This is a very nice pen for the Wacom Tablets. I have a Grip Pen that came with my Intuos 3 but I thought it would be nice to try another pen and maybe keep a different nib in it so I could swap out using them. I have found that this pen is a little small for me - I have larger hands - so this is not as comfortable as the larger Grip pen. But it functions just fine and I still use it quite a bit.
5,Absolutely Precious Doxies,Being an owner of three precious longhaired doxie babes - this card is the very best. I just sent out my first card last week and already received a email thank you for the 'cute card'.
5,grabbed tight,"frasier/weir grabbed my attention immediately.she has a knack for deveoping a crazy protagonist.her detectives are tough,no nonsense professionals.in this book,blondes do not have more fun."
5,Awesome,"Fast paced and exciting. There were absolutely no lulls in this novel. I plan to read ""Hush"" next but can't find it. Hope it is as good as this one. Recommended if you like the thriller type."
2,Good But...,In felt that this story was building up to a great big finally and boom there it was...the end and...I don't know... I felt let down. This was really a fast paced read up until the end and without giving up the ending I was left scratching my head as to how they figured it out and hello how they came about it. Still this was an okay read... certainly not one to rush out and buy brand new but one that is worth picking up second hand or from the library. Don't expect Lisa Gardner or Linda Howard but do keep an open mind.
4,Addicting Read *Plot Spoiler*,"""Sleep Tight"" is a great airplane/beach/doctor's office/hotel room read. Very well written, solid character development, expertly woven story...I could not stop reading. In fact, one night I said ""I will keep reading until the author reveals who the killer is"" but when I did, and realized (at 4AM) that it was some random guy who was not even on the suspect list, it was quite disappointing. I thought that was the most major flaw in the book. The only other thing was some of the behavior/dialogue of the killer was a little stereotypical, kind of what you'd expect if the average person described what they think a serial killer would act like. Other than that, very interesting story that keeps you reading into the wee hours!"
3,Useful,"As an aside, after reading ""Data warehouse toolkit"", ""Building the data warehouse"", and now ""Mastering data warehouse design"", I am none the wiser about the supposed chasm between Kimbalites and Inmonista; the book cover promises ""a cutting-edge response to Ralph Kimball's challenge to the data warehouse community"", but its pages did not even tell me what that challenge was, and I would be hard-pressed to define Imhoff's own ""Corporate Information Factory"". More to the point, I consider MDWD a worthwhile, substantial read, while noting a certain disjointedness - it's as if five heterogeneous articles have been put together - and complaining about, shall we say, not the most helpful explanations of implementation specifics. (This caused real annoyance, so three stars). Kimball's book came across much better in this regard, hence the thought ""Has Kimball written about this?"", but if you like your reading with a bit of challenge, Imhoff's is a good choice."
1,Wished I would have read the reviews first,"I purchased this product without reading the reviews first, DON'T BUY THIS. I wasted time reading the instructions to figure out how to develop a commerce site and realized that numerous steps were skipped or out of order. I contacted technical support with questions and suggestions and their response was just as vague/unhelpful as the lame manual. I never did get the commerce features (tables) to work, but it looks like when you download orders or update products that the website has to be ""locked"" while you do this. What a pain!"
5,Really Great!,"Let's think about this: the first three Elvis Costello albums were released in succession, with a year for all of them being recorded. They are all the same quality of songs, with minor upgrades in technique across the year. I am not implying that any one is better than another one. They are a good set of albums for the music poetry lover. In fact, the best course of action, would be to just buy all three. I find them complementary as well as, music for the times! This review has nothing to do with the lovely female friend I mentioned in my last EC album review. That's really my opinion."
1,Don't Bother,"I did not enjoy this book at all; I could not see the point of it all. Exley also seems to be quite the bigot, maybe he should have talked about that. Would have been more interesting then reading about his boring life. Don't waste your time on this...."
5,Simply my all-time favorite book,"Of the Trilogy, ""A Fan's Notes"" is by far the best. The cast of characters Exley introduces is as well-conceived as any I've ever read. I would have enjoyed another 200 pages on the enigmatic Mr. Blue alone. What haunts me most about A Fan's Notes, is that as I read, I was sure that Exley's writings contain more truth than fiction. It's a book I recommend to all my friends, and those who've taken the time to read it always thank me."
4,A Lonely Life,"I read this book after reading ""Misfit"", Jonathan Yardley's biography of Frederick Exley, and now feel that I have a much better understanding of Exley's talent. ""A Fan's Notes"" is not an easy book to read. Exley writes brilliantly and humorously, but the underlying depression, anger, frustration, and loneliness of his life makes the book almost unbearably sad, at times. It is unfortunate that so few people seem to be acquainted with this book, and Exley's life and works, in general. ""A Fan's Notes"" should be on any American literature reading list (and I regret it was not on any of mine when I was in college in the early '70's!) as a wrenching description of middle class American family life, the pursuit and worship of wealth and fame in our culture, and the despair of the ""average"" citizen."
5,Hilarious and Sad Warning about the Pitfalls of Self-Pity,"As many critics and nay-sayers have said about this book, about a sports fans who lives vicariously through sports heroes while drinking and watching life pass him by, this autobiographical novel is indeed an indulgent exercise but that is the point. Self-indulgence, self-pity, self-absorption are killers. They leave us inert. Exley's self-deprecation and humor elevate this from naval-gazer narcissism to a theme about men and their meaning of life crises. Many American men obsess over sports because sports provide a venue for their fantasies of masculinity, heroism, and self-worth. That Exley was able to take this subject, which affected him very deeply, and make the pathology universal is a great achievement in this book, a novelization of his life told with brutal honesty, self-introspection, and wisdom. For an updated novel about today's adults, still trapped in adolescence, check out Tom Perotta's comic novel Little Children."
1,too bad,"I do not find fault with mutts being in this scene because I think there is anything wrong with it. I do find fault with it because I like mutts best, but I prefer less religious Christmas cards!"
4,Celine Dion - All the way,"Great mix of live, studio and video tracks. Interesting to see the different styles as the DVD covers the whole range of Celine's career"
2,"Made in Germany ??? C'mon, Amazon, I'm in the USA !","Bought this several months ago, too busy to watch until now ..... and still can't. I guess I failed to see the made in Germany sticker on DVD wrapper until it was too late. Can't play it since it's wrong region ??? I thought Amazon only sold region 1 DVD's and that I didn't have to worry about country of origin. Or am I too naive to the process ? Can't find receipt, so I have no clue who duped me on this. So be warned - look closely when DVD arrives. In the mean time, I'll ring in the New Year with another Celine DVD."
5,For Celine lovers!,This DVD is for Celine Dion lovers. It has very nice vedio clips plus a collected songs from previous concerts which makes this DVD the best of Celine Dion on DVD. You can watch it again and again and agian and you'll never get bored. Also I have to mention here that the DVD qality is superb.
1,Kind of makes one sick.....,"I do not see the appeal of this singer, when she sings, it sounds like a cow going into labor. For all the songs and videos, It just shows me that great music is dead and gone in this day and age."
4,The creeping adoption of a cat,"As someone who has taken in several stray cats, I can relate to this story. Dancer is a cat that suddenly appears at a house where there are already two in-the-house-cats. While Dancer does not seem to be malnourished or haggard in any way, it appears that she has no home. Therefore, in true cat style, she adopts this one, living out in the garden and the potting shed. Of course, after some initial hostility, the two house cats grow fond of the interloper and at the end, all three cats have bonded into a play unit.This is a nice story about cats, how they can melt your heart and come to dominate your behavior in a way where you do not mind being the dominated one."
2,royal reveng,royal revenge supermystery is one of the best books i have ever read.i really enjoied reading this book because it really kept you thinking .i love all the nancy drew and hardy boy mystery. i started to read them when i was in fourth grade and i loved ever singl one of them.in royal reveng bess marvin nancys close friend falls in love with a boy named cass carrol .cass finds himself in a lot of trouble when he is the main supspcet of a muder.nancy drew and the hardy boys find themselves in tight spots.but the one bad thing that i will have't to tell you is that once you start reading you cant stop i fell that if you have a very good imagintion you will be pulled into the pages and understand other charters point of view.i would recomend this to anybody that love nancy drew or the hardy boys.
4,"Just right, but could be a bit sturdier","This works great, and with my mobile base. I would suggest a 90-degree adaptor with a 6"" length of hose to make it a bit easier to hook up to the rest of the system.Requires the removal of the lower shelf (at least so far), but I don't really use it anyway."
5,Can Bob ever top this?,"Although Husker Du were one of the greatest bands of the 80's...This is one of Bob Mould's all time masterpieces!! It is one of those albums,to paraphrase Neil Young, that will never rust. This is simply the tightest album in Pop and punk history.......ever!"
4,Bubble gum cut with fiberglass insulation,"One of the great releases of the 90's. ""Hoover Dam"" has soaring, rushing synth work, ""If I Can't Change Your Mind"" could be covered without the guitar noise and be a straight up pop hit.It's a terrific power pop album with extra doses of both power AND pop hooks. Everything Sugar released is worth hearing but this is the high point."
5,Criminally underrated!,"I haven't listened to Copper Blue much since my college era, but feel I owe it to the band to recommend this to everyone, as it gave me infinite audio pleasure for years! Bob Mould is a legend and I say that on the strength of his 'Sugar' work alone, as Husker Du were before my time. The songs are of a catchy, feel-good nature, with NO cheese whatsoever. You know you're onto something when a CD can be played from start to finish without needing to skip for poor stuff. A few years old (1992), but this makes no difference, it's class! In my Top 5 albums ever. Even more underrated (in the media sense) is 'Beaster' - 1993 mini-album. Get this too! Loud, sometimes happy, sometimes dark and very thought-provoking. If there was ever a band that deserved to be rich, it's Sugar - for these two releases. I hope they are."
2,Unless I Missed It...,"This album is the worst of all of EC's albums, but this is coming from someone who enjoys the less liked, later albums. It is a transition album in the worst way and by not choosing which path to go, it is unfortunately very weak. Stay away from this and Kodak Variety, if you enjoy most of EC's work. I may be alone on this.. but I believe that I'm correct."
4,"Good camera, Olympus made good on bad CCDs","I have owned my 5050 for coming up on 3 years now. It's a great camera, although many were effected by the bad Sony CCD issue.Mine went dead just after 2 years of use. Olympus covered the repair under an extention of the basic warranty for this problem only(announced just about the time miine broke, and they rebated earlier people who had paid for the repair). Took about 2 weeks to turn it around, and they did a nice job.There are some other longevity issues, many relating to the capacitor that preserves the settings when the batteries are out of the camera. Olympus is not covering that problem.I do love the camera. Takes great pictures, especially with the Olympus FL-36 flash attached. It has a fast, bright lens and works wonderfully after you lower the default sharpness setting and move the ISO mode to 64 or 100.Fears of longevity issues keep me from rating it a 5. Love of the pictures keeps the numbers high."
4,if only someone wrote this before...,"My review is going to be very valuable for those who bought already and have problems with Olympus C-5050 digital camera. That's the reason I post this as a Negative review although I think this is a very good camera when you understand how to use it. Here it goes. Read my lips: do NOT use Auto ISO - you'll get a lot of noise in your pictures. Configure you own settings (using My Mode) and set your ISO to 64 at all times. Any ISO higher that 64 (even 100) will produce noticeable noise. Also, while configuring ""My Mode"", set Noise Reduction to ""On"" and, the most important, set Sharpness to ""-4"" or ""-5"". If you do all the above, Canon G3 owners will be jealous of your shots."
5,Best Non-SLR digital available on the market!,"Typically, digitals have suffered from two major problems. Shutter lag and poor performance in low light situations. The Olympus cameras (particularly this one) suffer none of that. The shutter opens when you push the button which is crucial when your subject is a two year with the attention span of a gnat. Additionally, the f1.8 aperture lens is as good as it gets for a non-slr and consequently this camera does a great job in low light situations. Combine this with the incredible # of features (umpteen shooting modes, you can shoot the shot in Sepia, save to SmartMedia, CompactFlash, & XD picture cards), this is one great camera. I simply could not be more pleased. Finally, if you learn to master a decent photo editor (e.g., photoshop, paint shop pro), you can produce near works of art with this camera that people are willing to part money for. I have."
2,Breaks down !!!!,"take great pictures!!! But keeps on breaking. My sister and brother and me have the same one and all broke in a year. (3 camera ) all lemon? what are the odds? cost $175 to fix it. My sony cybershot digital camera produces poor quality pictures. I also own canon 20D and it's kinda heavy for disneyland, but has superb pictures, my dad has the Canon Sd canon 550 and it works good. I might get the same one..."
4,"Pretty good, a few issues.","Been using the 5050 for while now. Very happy with the quality of most shots. Features and flexibility are pretty good. The shooting modes are nice, programmability is good. Memory card flexibility is great (accepts Compact Flash, Microdrive, xD cards and Smart Media). The camera also offers a lot of resolution and compression options (including seperate TIFF AND RAW modes, in addition to other JPEG compression settings. Also includes a charger and rechargable batteries. Nice touch.The onboard flash is a little aggressive, causes lots of hot spots on subjects' hair, etc. Even with home-rigged diffusers it's a bit much. Fortunately, the hot shoe is not a dummy (it has contacts) so perhaps a suitable external flash can compensate for this.Images come out with significant noise in low light situations. Combined with the flash issue, this makes for problematic indoor shooting.I will probably keep this for the studio setting and pick up another camera for point-and-shoot stuff."
4,Needs a wee bit of improvement,"Pros:The camera takes wonderful photos which is the most important of all. The rounded grip makes a one handed hold very comfortable.Cons:There is no protection for the LCD display on back (unlike the Canon Powershot G1-3 in which the LCD folds in) so I had to purchase a separate LCD Protector for it. The little ""wheel"" knob under the on/off switch forces you to have to use two hands to make adjustments to the flash mode, macro shots etc."
3,Not quite worth the money,"The case and accessories that come with this kit aren't too bad, but not too great either. We bought one for each of our kids. One arrived with headphones that didn't work, and the headphones in the other one stopped working in about 2 weeks. I don't feel that the quality of the quality of the accessories are worth the $30 price tag. Other than that, the kids are happy with the kits."
3,50 Years Old```,"This book was written 50 years ago. Just thought I would give a heads up to Amazon buyers.Back then there were very few books on the subject and this was one everyone said to read.I did not like it, but that was 35 years ago when I was just starting my career as a Professional Dog Trainer."
2,Looks nice but doesn't work,"Unfortunately, the middle caster assembly developed so much play that it is not able to lift the base high enough to move the saw on my concrete floor.I'm going to have to try to see if Delta will provide me a replacement part, but the caster assembly part number identified in the manual is listed as ""not found or no longer available"" on their on-line parts catalog."
4,"Good, but should have been shorter","Nicely done story of two WWI units of ""minorities,"" or racial others, and how they served in the Great War. Slotkin is a good writer (although anyone who has been forced to read his earlier book, Regeneration through Violence, may be surprised.) Unfort., he does not seem to have been willing to leave out anything he found, and as a result he has come forth with a massive tome the size of which may scare off many readers."
2,It is nothing special and much too short.,"Although the graphics and backdrops are well done (much like the art in finer children's books) the puzzles are simple and the game is too short. An adult could easily complete it 2-3 hours and it has little or no replay value. Also, some of the dialog is corny and dumb and the character of Alice does not meet the standards one would hope for or expect. It is somewhat dissapointing over all."
1,DELTA 34-998,THIS ITEM COMES WITH NO HARDWARE.IT SHOULD AT LEAST COME WITH MOUNTING HDW FOR THE SHELF.
1,Got Me Too!,"I too thought that the problem would be fixed by now. Why they have a PCMCIA card reader to USB in the photo, I'll never know. We are lucky that Amazon has an excellent return program. This is my second attempt at an adapter."
5,Divining the Body is Divine!,Great book! I bought this on recommendation of a friend and love it. The book has some great new ways to reconnect with the space we carry around with us. Gave me a new appreciate all the wonderful different parts of me. I highly recommend it.
5,Important Questions...Practical Answers,"Collins and Lazier wrote this book for those who seek answers to questions such as these:1. What kind of leadership must you provide to your organization so that it will achieve the performance, impact, reputation, and longevity it needs...not only to succeed but to sustain that success?2. How can you formulate an appropriate vision for your organization and then galvanize the commitment and efforts of others to achieve that vision?3. What are the tough decisions to be made when selecting those strategies which are needed?4. Meanwhile, what must be done to create and then sustain a culture within which innovative thinking is not only encouraged but nourished?5. What is ""tactical excellence""? What must be done to create an environment within which it is achieved and then (once again, a key word) sustained?If you need answers to these questions, Collins and Lazier provide them."
2,Power cord needs revision,"A couple of years ago I bought this machine. In the first week of use the arbor (sticking out on the right side) caught the power cord as I pulled the blade toward me. The protective plastic had spun off the arbor earlier... so the metal chewed right into the electrical wire. The biggest concern I had was the potential run-away blade due to the wire wrapping into something. I called customer service and they didn't seem to care. I visited a big chain store recently and tried to see if anything had changed... it hadn't. On a display model I easily replicated the incident (without the power on). Delta needs to make the cord coiled, or shorter, or longer. Maybe the Consumer Product Safety Commission will tell them so after someone gets hurt. I sent mine back. It was too dangerous."
3,Best of an misunderstood artist,"Behold the fact that this is by no means a greatest hits album; Yoko Ono has only had one hit throughout her 28 year old career (the title track). Although several tracks on this compilation have been new-wave cult favourites, it is doubtfull that the average person will find even the most accessible material very enjoyable. Die-hard Yoko fans will claim that is because the music is so profound (which is often the fact), others will try the tried-and-true excuse that rejects her work as simply not interesting. This album contains many good songs, but as it does not display a full spectrum of her musical talents as does the ""Ono box"", I would not recommend it as a starting point for listening to this artist."
3,It's Ok,"It is a ok CD. The vocals are great and everything, just a bit old. If you love the old music that's great, this is the album for you. The CD is a great CD to own, but it is not my type of music. If you listen to Michael Jackson and junk this is a great Cd to have, but I am too young to remember this decade. As I said be fore the vocals are great, I think this is the best CD they have made in a long time, so I suggest you should try it out, you never know you might fall in love with it."
1,"casting broke,versa feed did not even turn on","bought both these,mount broke&the feed wouldn't even power up.have called&called but no one will return my call.WHY?"
2,Bad Movie Made Worse,"Troma doesn't really know their target audience. Seems to me they take perfectly sleazy movies and cut out most of the sleaze. I refuse to believe the director of Rabid Grannies would have filmed copious amounts of cheesy gore simply to have every scrap of it edited out. Troma's claim that this is the ""director's cut,"" is a load of fiber. It's almost as if they cut out all the gore so they could fill up their ""EXTRAS"" area. I suggest avoiding it."
4,Good Buy,"This outfeed table is well worth the price paid. Assembly took me about half a day, but I wasn't in any rush. It color-matches the light grey of the Unisaw nicely. I really like the 12"" fixed portion of the table- it helps on follow-through for smaller work pieces which don't necessarily require use of the full outfeed table. I'd like to reiterate what one of the reviewers said earlier that, unfortunately, when the table is not in use and hanging down adjacent to the saw, the single support leg of the table completely blocks the saw's exhaust port. I would rather see a support leg on each corner of the table, which would allow access for a 4"" hose to attach to the exhaust port AND would provide a bit more stability for the extended outfeed table. A hose can still be attached, but the lowered table will not be able to drop to a completely vertical position. I would still recommend this table."
4,great accessory,"Real good addition to the table; set up was simple; I think this is a must for this table given most users will probably by laying full size plywood sheets on it; you really need the stability to safely work; I tried a single roller stand initially but it was unreliable and unsteady which is why I bought this table; one gripe is my saw is on a moving platform, the standard leg for the extension table has these rubber feet that drag along the ground as I move the table; when I lower the table the end actually rests on the ground; I don't think it's a major problem though since I can probably replace them with wheels later."
4,Back in time...,"Yes, its the one your parents listened to! Brings back all those old Christmas memories."
1,Not the Original Narrator for Disc 1,"Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Jacob & Joseph Disc no longer has the original narrator reading from the King James Bible. Reader's Digest must have purchased this from The New Media Bible and decided to dumb it down. The authentic music and the bible verses read by an amazing voice, have been replaced by an annoying narrator who tries to explain the stories for a pre-teen who's never read the bible. I've been waiting 15 years for these films to be converted to DVD, and now I'm extremely disappointed that they've been ruined. I've never seen the other 5 discs, so I don't have a reference as to whether they've been changed from the original version. I will be buying the VHS and converting it to DVD myself."
4,New Grad's Opinion,"I am graduating from college and I just purchased this book to get ready for my first job after college. What information is out-of-date? I don't want to embarrass myself at my new job.From what I have read so far, this is a good book. It offers a refresher on etiquette, and notes some things that I hadn't considered."
2,Very Basic,This is an extremely basic overview of business etiquette. Some of it is out-dated. I would not recommend this book for a classroom.
2,A Few Interesting Tunes But It Wears Thin After A While,"This disc would be OK for a little while at a party. Songs like I Can See Clearly Now, Red Red Wine, Murder She Wrote, and Oh Carolina are pretty cute. Clapton's cover of Knocin' On Heavens Door is decent and Tommorow People is decent. Wheres the rhythms are fairly enjoyable, the chord progressions are way too repetitive. Couple that with some nothing special lyrics as well as a few tunes(?) where the lyrics are totally indecipherable and I get the feeling of a headache comming on. A few more quality Bob Marley tunes are needed here."
4,Server 2003,Very well documented. It touches all the relevent topics an administrator needs to know.
1,dreadful,"This title was only $10 so I didn't expect a great game. But I was hoping to at least get my money's worth. Hard to say if it was worth even half of that.More than just your money, don't waste your time on this. If you must have a racing game for your PSP, try to save more money for the much better titles like Ridge Racer or Burnout Legends."
3,For Sax Lovers,"If you're a sax lover, you probably want this album. I wanted a couple of songs from it, and ended up enjoying just that. An entire album of sax is a bit trying--at least for me. I really appreciate the up-tempo wailing songs, but the slower songs just reminded me that I was listening to a saxophone, which at times sounded too alone."
4,"The Voice, The Stage was meant for this type of concert","Given the fact that this was filmed a while ago, her confidence has grown, as has her music. I found the concert to be full of life, passion, and true emotion. I can't help falling in love, just has to be seen to believed. The power of celine is captured well in this concert. A must for all lovers worldwide, also check out Live in memphis, another massive concert from 1997 It's just gonna get better."
5,"Finding the ideal location - some tips.Then,simply enjoy!","As others have written, the feeder may cause hungry birds to fly into glass windows and end up crippled or dead. We got around this by choosing a shaded window facing a wooded area. The result? No glare or way for birds to mistake a window for the sky or reflected space.Placement did not seem to decrease the bird population which stopped by. In our case, we bought the feeder to provide variety for a bird lover who was too ill io leave bed. It did the trick-and wonderfully. We all loved watching the birds as well as a squirrel which (luckily) seemed far more intent on pulling stuffing out of an old porch pillow.....for a nest?.....than raiding the feeder. We are very satisfied with our purchase (we are keeping an eye on that squirrel,though, in case it starts diving for the feeders) .Happily, our bird lover also enjoys watching squrrels so we have an additional spot for them. Is that a mistake?"
1,needs to protect the seeds from moisture,"The bird food is not protected from moisture. Therefore, the seed gets wet and hardens so that the birds can not get to the seeds,"
4,Pretty good,Over all I belive this is a good effort from Eve...but like the first Cd it has a few Good tracks and a few bad ones...Got what U need has a pretty tight beat..and I thought that Whos that girl was good. If your looking for a Cd to bounce to in your ride..this will keep you busy.
1,Not great,"I purchased this cd used for the song ""Who's that Girl,"" only. The rest of the cd does nothing for me. To each his own, I guess."
5,"Eve, the queen of rap","Bow down to Eve, she is the queen of rap, her beats and rymes are second to none, she doesn't have filthy disgusting lyrics like Lil' Kim. I am a huge fan of Eve ever since I heard her last album, this album is a better effort there are a lot more bumpin' songs on this album. My favorite track has to be ""Who's that Girl"", which had radio play, but desrved more, other good tracks include ""Cowboy"", ""That's What it is"", ""Got what ya need"", ""Be Me"" and of course the big hit off the album ""Let me Blow ya mind"". I eagerly anticipated EVe's next album, and I think any rap fan should pick this one up."
3,chgo music lover,"The cd is nice, but it doesn't hit like Who is Jill Scott? It's listenable, but not worthy of my replay button. I wouldn't say its a waste of money because its still a rather decent album, but it pales in comparison to the first. Maybe the comparison isn't fair. I mean afterall, Jill was hungry then, and you could hear it in the music. I feel like this is a combination of throwback tracks thrown on an album just to please the fans."
3,Not as good as the 1st! CD,"I enjoy listening to Jill Scott. I instantly fell in love with her first cd when it debuted in 2000. Just about every song on the album is a hit. With her second album, I was expecting it to be just as good or better than the first. There's only one other song that I like besides the two songs ""Golden"" and ""Family Reunion"" that is being played on the urban radio stations but the rest of them are not as catchy. Hopefully the rest of the album will eventually grow on me as I continue to listen to the rest of the songs."
5,Refreshing Variety,"Jill Scott has once again released a spectacular album. I must admit that I was expecting (and would have been perfectly happy with) something more along the lines of her phenomenal first album, but that's not what you get here. Scott has decided not to play it safe here, she's trying new things musically. She experiments with traditional big-band jazz (peep the second half of ""Talk To Me"", it's sweet) , neo-soul, and other genres. W&S 2 is definitely more polished than her debut album, it has an organic feel rather than a raw feel to it. The album is much more different than ""Who is Jill Scott?"" but it is definitely a wonderful album that I play nearly every day."
5,Beautifully Human,"I love this cd! I can easily play this cd all the way through over and over without skipping tracks, although i do have my favorites. I think she is truly a poet and it always shows through her songs. I can't say I like this one better than the 1st though, they both are good. I can relate to just about every song on there and the beats are tight too. I can't wait for Vol. 3!!"
3,FOOL'S GOLD?,"While I love all of Jill Scott's material, after 2-3 listens to her latest CD, and I find it a tangible letdown of sorts. While I cannot fault Jill's sterling vocal control, technique, and sheet lung power (!), I think she needs to work with some outside writers - many of these songs/interludes set a sexy, introspective ""mood"" but don't deliver the goods in terms of hooks and memorable SONGS, save for the stunning, uplifting single GOLDEN - if you don't tap your toe on that one, check your pulse. I also respect Jill's infectious spiritual take on things. She just needs better material next time out. But I saw her do GOLDEN on Jimmy Kimmel last night, and she TORE IT UP with a jazzy-scat-breakdown, WOW! See her LIVE, wait on this."
5,Ms. Scott has done it again. . .,"It is of no surprise to me that Jill Scott has created muscial beauty with ""Beautifully Human."" The words she speaks are enduring. When put to music they are electric.My favorite track ""Just Run Across my Mind"" speaks volumes to women and that one (or perhaps) two men in their life that was no good for them, but thought of often nontheless.Simply Excellent!"
5,"Oh,Yeah!!!!!!!","Jill,this album is OFF THE HOOK!!!This album is so ''Golden''!My favorites are :''Warm Up'',''Golden'',''The Fact Is(I Need You),''Spring Summer Feeling'',''Cross My Mind'',''Bedda At Home'',''Talk To Me'',''Family Reunion'',''Can't Explain(42nd Street Happenstance),''Whatever'',and ''Not Like Crazy''.This album really grew on me!It is better than Who Is Jill Scott?Words And Sounds,Vol.2.I love it!!!!"
4,My First Real Exposure To The Force Known As Jill Scott,"Let me say right off the bat that I have listened to a lot of Jill Scott's stuff over the years but this is the first album I have ever purchased.The song that sold me to this album was ""Golden."" I personally find it very inspirational and uplifting! The rest of the album was average to above average. ""Golden"", in my view, is the only standout track.Many reviews say this is Jill's weakest album. Well, if this is her weakest, then I want to hear her best because her ""weakest"" impressed me enough to purchase her stuff in the future!"
3,Sugar free Tussin,"Was not impressed with this product. Tastes nasty, and the amount I got for the price was very small. Much better buys (and taste) from one bought in the stores."
3,My Secret Life in the CIA,"I have read many books about CIA and found the book to be really interesting This is just tip of the iceberg, Mr. Mendes surely will not expose all the really good information. I guess some is better than non."
2,Started out great,"The beginning was good and fast moving. As I read along, it got harder and harder to stay with it. It got too ""wordy""."
5,Fast-paced & Factual,"This book is fast-paced by keeping the facts brief and relevant. It's not an expose so much as a pleasant example of an agent who is sharing his more interesting missions in a catchy, intriguing style. A quick, worthwhile read."
3,Interesting spy story,This book is very interesting about how our spys work. It is not a gripping thriller. More of an explanation of their lives. I have only read 2/3rds of it because it is easy to lay aside for a while. I definitely will finish it.
5,great book,This is a wel written book and very informative. I was captured within the first several pages and it held my attention all the way through. Antonio sure seemed like he had an interesting life and his descriptions of his trip through the CIA was fascinating. I highly recommend this book.
3,Amazing Story,"Okay, so he kind of brags, but after what he's done, I guess he has bragging rights. After seeing Argo, I have to read more about Mendez, and this satisfies much of my curiosity. Not the best written book, but worth reading if you are as fascinated as I am about ""the craft."""
3,Master of disguise.,This is an ok read it tends to drag in some places and gets pretty fast paced in others. I bought this at a discount price because it has been out a couple of years. Glad I did not pay full price.
4,CIA just who is it?,History buff / CIA unknown just who they are/ found book very intersting andenlighting. My thanks to Mr.Mendez for all he has gone through for our freedom.
5,good book,"This is a good book on what life is like in the CIA as an ""artist"" in the technical disguises division. Best to read after you have either seen the movie or read the book Argo. He writes with humor so the book is an easy read. He gives away no secrets of the CIA but wrote this with the CIA support."
3,Historical,The inception of the CIA to the toil of covert opperations that impacted history. I was engaged by the suppense. I always liked reading spy vs spy as a child.
3,Spooks,If the CIA approved the release of the book then I expect it to be a superficial work of spy mastery
5,Great Read,A truly intriguing look into the murky world of Intelligence gathering between nations. The amazing thing being that this book barely scrapes the surface of what must be going on daily.
2,"Boring, poorly written",This could have been so much more - but was poorly written. Lots of material that had the potential to be exciting if it had been handled correctly.
4,Interesting reading,"A friend lent me this book and was a great introduction to palmistry (for me, anyway). It has a little bit of everything,like how the size and shape of your hands is a reflection of your personality. It is a fun book to read if you want to learn a little bit about everything."
2,Don't Finish Listening,"Since the first ten tracks were so uneven, there was really no point in finishing the album, which I bought because of ""X,"" which I have learned is a mistake. The whole compendium of West Coast guests can't turn this album around, and, if you are a West Coast gangsta fan, I would instead recommend Tupac-All Eyez on Me, Dr. Dre-The Chronic, and Snoop Dogg-Doggystyle instead."
5,X TO THE Z,"THIS IS X'S BEST ALBUM YET. HE HAS TIGHT BEATS AND SWEET LYRICS. THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR ALL HARDCORE RAP FANS! THE BEST SONGS ARE FRONT 2 BACK, AND X. ALL THE OTHER SONGS ARE PHAT TOO. PEACE OUT!"
3,Far from great....just ok....,"Big letdown---Dre only produces 1 track on here, and co-produces 2 more....plus, I am not really a big fan of xzibit's voice... he is great on backup or for chorus, but it gets old when he is rapping for 3-4 minutes straight....he is a good rapper, I am not saying he is not...I just think the production on this record is a little weak...."
5,Not just another Surf xmas album!!,"Most of the reviews note the surf sound. I agree that it's catchy for the most part. But for the sentimental seeking ballads, you MUST hear White Christmas, and Silver Bells!!"
5,Ventures' Christmas Joy,"My mother was a Ventures' fan when I was born. She bought this LP wondering ""how on earth can they do Christmas""? They do a fabulous job that's how they do it! I was also raised on Johnny Mathis' Merry Christmas LP and that's wonderful too! The Ventures' didn't try to change their style - if you are familiar with their music, then you hear a touch of Walk Don't Run, Diamond Head, Tequila, etc. They are close to the real Christmas song and its great! I have purchased CD's for many friends/family that I turned onto this album. The only catch I've found is at the end of Frosty the Snowman, I want to say Tequila! Highly recommend this to people who are light hearted and like original ""rock/pop"" instrumentals. This is fun, not gospel or Trans-Siberian. Its for a rockin' good time."
4,The Venture's Christmas Album,"Even if you can't paddle out or find yourself land-locked on Christmas, just throw this classic album in and it'll be like you're chilling in front of the bonfire at San O' between catching some waves with your family and friends. It's the classic, clean surf sound the Ventures can be counted on for, only this time it's to holiday tunes!"
1,What do you expect?,Could not watch the first 20 minutes of the movie. It skipped and acted like it has a scratch but their is nothing visible. Could quite possibly chalk it up to bad luck....
2,"Sorta like the ""The Hangover"" but without the funny parts.","It's supposed to be a witty and clever film, but.. It gets dark and misses the funny bits.. You end up taking the brunt of the insults as a personal affront, instead of the women he's supped to be insulting.. It made me sad..."
2,Not funny!,"Knock off of too many other movies. It escaped me why others recommended this to me, but we are all different."
4,Adults only,"Definately not for kids. I've heard the book is better, but the movie is pretty good. When they make a movie out of the other book I'll get it too."
2,Horrible Acting,It was painful to watch the forced acting. There was no natural flow to the conversations and I ended up hating the main character with an intense passion.
4,Immature but I laughed my @$$ off,"I don't know what's up with the bad reviews. If people don't like this kind of comedy, why do they watch it. And if they didn't see the film, then they shouldn't be posting bad reviews. I thought this had a good story to it. And it had some really good toilet humor. Now Ima have to cop the book cuz you know the old saying...."
5,Awesome,"This movie is a must have for dry sense humor folks that understand the beauty of a nonchick flick that stands. GUYS THIS ONE IS FOR YOU. Great humor, raunchy cast and adventures throughout. The only people that would find this movie boring or etc. would be individuals that don't like a little raunch alondside with their humor. Great movie."
2,"Book yes, DVD no","Based on a bestseller that had a few chapters that were screaming funny. Somehow, this just did not translate into a great comedy movie. I consider myself right in the wheelhouse of the target market too; lovedThe Hangover (R-Rated Single-Disc Edition), Naked Gun, Monty Python movies, Jim Carrey fan, Animal House, etc.I found myself in scene after scene trying to like this because of the book. That should never happen, and did not bode well. To be polite, this movie had a few moments. To be honest, it was sophomoric and forced, and painfully unfunny. Not even a grin. Not once. Fast forwarded through more than a few scenes. May have to retaliate next year for getting this as a Xmas present."
2,A little thin and overlong...,"The film started well, but lost its way in the middle section (when Tucker was MIA). If it were trimmed it probably would have been a decent road trip movie."
4,Blu-Ray Quality (Short n Simple),"I recently added this movie to my Blu-Ray collection. The sound is 5 stars. The visual quality is 4 stars. There are no annoying black specs but the video quality seems a littly fuzzy on 1080P. Overall, if you enjoyed this movie it is most likely worth upgrading from DVD."
5,The man,This guy is what every college student dreams of becoming! Couldnt of asked for a better purchase. I highly recommend his book too
1,Disappointed,"I've never posted a negative review before but I was very disappointed in this book after reading the other reviews. It does cover the basics (eliminate debt, invest, have your own business) on very broad terms so perhaps might be useful as a primer if you haven't read much on personal finance before. But if you already know to do those things, I doubt you'll find much useful information here and you won't find much detailed guidance."
2,Out dated Classic,"I purchased this book after it being quoted in one of Gerald Loeb's books. Sadly while it offered some good advice I was disappointed in the writing style and it made for boring burdensome reading. I advise all readers to skip this one and buy William O'Neal's: ""The successful investor"" for a quick clear read with the same basic information and updated in modern form.Here are some quotes from this book:It is better to own the wrong stock at the right time than the right stock at the wrong time. (Bear markets take them all down).Play a trend and get out when it seems to be stopping.Never hold on to a loser. Sell it!Don't talk about your investments until you are out of them.(Excellent advice)Great advice is buried in these pages, but there are much better books out there that are effortless to read."
4,Very well written intro to storage virtualization,"A concise and well written book on storage virtualization. Starting with explanation of file meta data and storage meta data the author uses good illustrations to dive reasonably deep and explain the concepts behind each mode of virtualization starting from server down to switch, appliance and array-based virtualization. The book is not wordy nor does it waste time on pointless rambling on the history of storage networking etc.. I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in truly understanding the concepts behind this upcoming technology."
3,"pretty, but small","Unfortunately these are much smaller than I had hoped. I'm keeping them because they are pretty, but I wish they were twice the size. I'm sure the size is listed on the description and it's my mistake for not noticing."
4,"Very pretty, very very slight defect.","These earrings are great. It's nice to have such pretty studs. However, I am nit-picky. One of the pearls is slightly off as far as symmetry goes. It's something that bothers me because they are a $50 dollar pair of earrings (not earrings from Claire's or Target). Still, they're beautiful."
3,Try Pampers instead,"While I hardly would consider myself an expert on baby wipes, I started off with the huggies wipes and diapers and had some issues with the diapers, so switched to Pampers which are a thousand percent better. Then once I depleted our supply of huggies wipes we switched to Pampers wipes which are a lot softer and more pliable. My advice is to go with Pampers over Huggies but you may find the Huggies work better for you."
2,COME AROUND IS HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL,"PULLING INTO A NEW TOWN I FINALLY GOT INTO MY HOTEL ROOM AND THE RADIO WAS PLAYING ""COME AROUND"". THE SONG HAUNTED ME SO MUCH I CALLED THE STATION UNTIL THEY ANSWERED AND TOLD ME WHO THE ARTIST WAS.MS RICHIE HAD ME IN THE PALM OF HER HAND WITH THAT SONG, BUT GETTING THE CD WAS LESS HAUNTING THAN HOKEY.... SEEMS SHES CAUGHT BETWEEN SINGING JINGLES ,TWANGING COUNTRY AND DOING MIDDLE OF THE ROAD POPTOO BAD INDEED."
4,This book is cult,Although it has been written 15 years ago it's anything but antiquated (apart from the cover maybe). Easy to read and very descriptive. I read it first when I started climbing 13 years ago and it has accompanied me ever since.
3,Make a living crashing planes for movies?,"Dick Grace made his living crashing planes for the movies between WWI and WWII, and this book tells of those 47 crashes. (He died of natural causes--emphysema?--in his 60s.) No ILM here: he had to really crash wood-and-fabric airplanes as the scripts required, so he had to make the airplane and its crash target survivable for himself. Must hit the ground straight down at 110mph...must crash into a barn so that the whole airplane disappears into the barn... I recall this much from a Readers' Digest Condensed Book version I read over 40 years ago. A fun read (but that, from me, is like a drunkard saying a fun drink), informative about its topic and era, reasonably well written, different from most of what's in bookstores...I won't press it on you (read the Bible, God's own book), but this'll tell you a little about ""Crash Pilot"" and perhaps help increase or decrease your interest. (With a little poking you can find a little about Dick Grace on the internet.)"
3,A little disappointed!,"Wanting something different from the other activity tables available, I sought this toy out about six months ago, finally finding it on-line. Sadly, my now 15 month old son has had very little interest in it except to attempt to climb onto it. I will hang on to it, assuming he might get more interested (in the train for example) as he gets older, but so far he has not even really gotten into it at all. Ironically, his aunt got him one of the other activity tables at a garage sale a few months ago, and he loves it!!"
4,Watch the legs,"This is a fun toy and my 3 children play with it a lot but since the top comes off to flip over, my baby likes to take it off and sit in the base as a chair and this is NOT safe. the legs come off too easily. any amount of pressure and they flop out. so even if you have a little one leaning on it for balance trying to play the legs fall off and they end up on top of the toy on the floor. so the top is lots of fun just take it off the base before the recommened age plays with it."
5,Great Job Xzibit,"I Brought this CD on itunes and I really loved it when I heard the album straight through. he has some great guest appearences from Nate Dogg on Been A Long Time, Dr. Dre on U Know, From Krs-one on The Kenny Parker Show 2001 and Eminem on Don't Approach Me. Here are the standout tracks on the album.Front 2 BackBeen A long TimeXThe Kenny Parker Show 2001Don't Approach MeBest of Things"
3,Cute and Fun,"This skooter is pretty small. The handle bars are low. It probably can't carry anyone more than 100lbs. It has a very small area to stand on so not good for the older siblings to try since they can't fit their feet on it, but fun for my eight year old daughter who cruises at slow speeds."
1,Not great,The wheels are too small on this product to make it fun for the kids. It does not roll well. It did come mostly assembled which was a plus. I never would have purchased it had we seen and tried it in a store.
4,Solid but HEAVY,"I expected these to provide ample protection from blowouts, but these might be bullet-proof. They are VERY heavy, so expect your ride to get a little tougher. Mine is a short commute, so I don't care much, but if you're riding long distances, keep the weight of these tubes in mind. That said, I think they perform as advertised."
2,better off paying more,"If you live in an area where you can catch thorns - do yourself a favor and buy an expensive brand - like specialized, or just go tubeless (worth it if u are truly nuts with ur riding)."
4,My eyes are still bleeding...,I inhaled this book two months ago and my eyes are still bleeding. It sure is a triumph of good over elvis. I listened to the records at the same time and took it in the ears as well as the eyes. A great man once said 'I never met a man I didn't like' But then I wouldn't trust anyone who listens to the Royal Trux. I think I hear my mom calling...
1,Misleading Title,"""A First Look at Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks..."" might be a lot more accurate. It does a good job of covering the concepts. What it doesn't do is address any of the issues of implementing a fuzzy system in an embedded environment. If you don't know what a fuzzy set is then you should consider this book. If you want some tips or ideas for creating an inference engine for an 8 or 16 bit processor I suggest you look elsewhere."
3,Engineering Rules,One's tragedy is others' way to demonstrate own talents too often.What mysteries of demolitions?Just more engineering should be added while considering JOINTS of metal frame roads.
1,So what next....?,"So if everyone who has seen this film really believes that the US Government is behind the September 11 attacks then what exactly are you doing about it?If you aren't doing anything about it, I doubt that you really and truely believe this stuff.That said, why go to all of the trouble to implode WTC 1 and 2? Were they really concerned that destroying the buildings in a messy way would cause too much damage downtown? Come on."
5,comparrison to other 9/11 Documentaries,"To date I have seen most if not all of the 9/11 documentaries. None has been as complete or as compassionate as 911 Mysteries part 1 Demolitions. The producer has presented some horrible but real evidence, in the softest and most caring way imaginable. Especially for those trying to share the truth with those easily turned off by an aggressive approach, this is the documentary to use."
5,the partridge family shopping bag cd.,the partridge family shopping cd is fanastic and i reccommend it to anyone who loves their music!
4,Like a Sniper with a Rocket,"Amy LaVere's CD ""Anchors & Anvils"" is a catchy mix that entertains & intrigues. The opener ""Killing Him"" marches to a steady beat as the lyric reveals the surprise that ""killing him didn't make the love go away."" Carla Thomas' ""That Beat"" is a great track with Bob Furgo's gypsy violin accentuating its soulful strut, ""He gives me nothing but trouble; He keeps disturbing my sleep."" ""Washing Machine"" throbs joyfully as thoughts of all the more enjoyable things one could do other than laundry fill the lyric. ""I bought it for a song I had saved up in my pocket & I tucked it in my coat like a sniper with a rocket,"" Amy sings on the lethal ""Cupid's Arrow."" Amy transforms a Dylan song from his CDEmpire Burlesqueto a soft last call closer. ""Anchors & Anvils"" is memorable for LaVere's wry vocal delivery and distinctive song selection. Enjoy!"
3,Great Potential!!,"This movie was good. It had excellent potential. It is the female ""Barbershop"". I was disappointed that lil kim received credit as well as appeared on the cover when she was only in the movie twice. Whitney Houston on the other hand put in a surprise appearance, but did not allow her name to be used in the film. Bobby Brown played his normal ""bad boy"" role well. The actors all did a great job. The script was well written. I also loved that oriental actors were also used in the film.I would definitely reccommend viewing this film of talented people of color."
1,Very poor effort...,"I didn't have high hopes for this book, and it didn't disappoint me. The F-15 pilot can apparently fly halfway around the country on afterburner before fueling, and can defeat many-on-one scenarios at will. Anyone that has the slightest knowledge of modern day fighters and weapons would know that this scenario could never play out. The book seems more like some daydream of a teenager than a well thought out techothriller."
2,A Brief and True Report....,"I got this one for my Kindle and I really enjoyed it, BUT, be forewarned! This book was written in the early 17th century, the syntax, structure, spelling, and nomenclature are archaic and difficult. The author never read Struck and didn't have spell-check!!! You will put some real effort into reading this book, but it's worth it, you will gain insight and knowledge about the place and period that you didn't have before."
1,"COFFEE, CHEESEBURGER, FRENCH FRIES.","This is a series of 2 films. A man gets scratched by a radioactive cat and develops strength and the ability to light cigarettes with his laser eyes. He battles against a group of jungle thugs led by a Satan worshiper with a stick that shoots fire. People run around and beat each other up for no apparent reason while the bad guys talk about taking over the county (Thailand?) and then the world.In the second episode, the remaining gang attempts to get a nuclear starter, whatever that is.The films are poorly dubbed, almost to the point you were wondering if they didn't change the film. Guns would fire whenever someone would simply carry a gun, no pulling of trigger required. The martial arts aspect was more comical than serious. The same dubbed noise was made if someone punch the face or a body's soft part. The tales are idiotic. The cartoon front is a deception. These are not kid movies.Parental Guide: F-bomb, pre-rape activities. No nudity."
3,Dodgy remixes but good music video included on the CD,"Tout Est Bleu was the wrong choice of CD Single for Jarre's mostly decent and partially vocal album, 'Metamorphoses.' A very commercial track and quite dancy it fits nicely in between the tastes of Jarre fans (hardcore electronic music) and mainsteam dance and thus appeals to no one. It didn't enter the Top 75 in the UK.However, the music is passable, and worth having if you're a completist. Of course the best aspect of this CD Single is that (thanks to Sony's Multimedia department) it contains a Quicktime / MPEG video of the music video for the Eiffel 65 remix. The quality isn't quite as good as the C'est la Vie video but it's enjoyable nonetheless.As for the remixes, don't expect much, that Phats and Small remix is much like one of their previous tracks (but I like it), and Eiffel 65 is a cliche from start to finish."
4,Import includes Without You!,"The duo's latest is a collection of classic as well as not so well known soul songs all done the H2O way. Also included are three new compositions from the guys that fit in with the overall flow of the album. The bonus track included in this Japanese pressing is the cover of Badfinger's Without You (and not Me & Mrs Jones as indicated in Amazon's writeup). The song was used for a TV commercial in the land of the rising sun (check out the duo's official website for a link to the commercial).Overall, the album is a tribute to the music that shaped Hall & Oates' sound over the years. Nothing particularly stands out in this album; it works as a whole and is a pleasant listen from start to finish. Essential for avid fans of Hall & Oates and the cover of Without You is great to have (it'll make you forget all other versions except that of Nilsson's)."
3,What A Voice!!!,"First off, the 3 stars isn't for Dusty Springfield or her music...those deserve 5. But this collection could've been better. First off, as already mentioned, the sound quality is a bit questionable. The other big problem is the annoying ommision of ""Son of A Preacher Man"" which was one of her biggest hits. I bought the album mainly for two songs which are the 60's pop classic ""I Only Want To Be With You"" and the gorgeous ballad ""You Don't Have To Say You Love Me."" Also included is the 60's pop staple ""Wishin and Hopin"" and the seductive ballad ""The Look of Love."" Other gems are ""All I See Is You,"" ""Little By Little,"" and ""I'll Try Anything.""If you are a casual fan or just curious *like me* this is an ok buy, but if you are looking for a little more, I would look elsewhere."
3,A self Indulgent study of doubt and moral uncertainty,"I wrote Mr. Krakauer a letter after his article appeared in Outside. He chose to include that letter in his book. I am identified as ""an attorney from Florida"" towards the end of the narrative. I can only reiterate what I said then. This is an account that need not have ocurred. Mr. Krakauer uses us as his collective therapist, to attempt to assuage his own doubt and uncertainty regarding his motives and morals."
5,Once in a long while...,"Once in a long while, you'll find a book that leaves you spellbound...""Into Thin Air"" is one of those books. It's like finding a rare gift. The story was on par with the best fiction/adventure. I found Mr. Krakauer's writing ""adequate"", but the drama potrayed, overpowered any deficits. I felt the heady challenge and discovery. I wept, felt the helplessness, and eventually the sadness on the frailty of human beings, but uplifted by the strength of the human spirit.It left me wanting to know much more about the people and world of climbing, particularly the Himalayas."
5,Harrowing,"There are few subjects of which I have utterly no interest. Before I read this book, mountain climbing was one of them. I don't know how he did it, but Jon Krakauer's account of the 1996 season on Mount Everest has a gut wrenching immediacy that I have seldom, if ever, encountered. This book was all I thought about during the time I read it, and for quite some time afterwards. This has to be one of the all time greatest true adventure stories ever written. Just read it."
1,What a way to make money,"The author claims that he is a liberal. He critisizes people like Sandy Pittman, who in his opinion was unfit to climb Everest. She was there only because she was rich and able to pay 75,000 dollars. At the same time, however, he wrote a book about the tragedy, which made him a lot of money. He was no different then the rest of the paying customers. As much as he is trying to convince the reader that he is a professional climber, it is obvious that he has no idea how to behave on the mountain. 90% of the story is full of self pity and excuses for not trying to help the others. All he thinks of is his own survival. He also critisizes the brave Boukreev, who rescued three people (God rest his soul) while Krakauer was sleeping in his tent. This book is the work of a mediocre go-getter. Read ""the Climb"" and forget about this pot head."
4,good transaction - slow delivery,"Good transactions, yet I expected to receive the product in less than 14 days. Most likely not an issue with the merchant, but moreso with the Post Office."
1,"Like ""Into the Wild,"" ""Into Thin Air"" was way too long.","As I was reading each, I couldn't help but think I was reading an elongated version of his ""Outside"" magazine articles, painfully stretched out into a book version. Both books he claims he ""had to write"" -- ""Into the Wild"" for the family's sake, and ""Into Thin Air"" to get it off his chest. I think maybe he had to write them for the money -- and/or fame. Both books would make fairly good reading if 50% shorter (like forget the first half). It made me angry that I had to waste my time reading the fluff before I could get to what the book, its reviews and its cover promised it would tell me. Shame on Jon Krakauer! Next time I'll happily settle for the ""Outside"" articles!"
2,The Krakauer Disaster,"I have to admit that I was rather frustrated with this book. Krakauer actually shows how thin hir report of the 1996 Everest desaster is. Nothing against his points of view but this book contaisn too much the word ""I"". I did this, I did that... Not to mention that Anatoli Boukreev's heroism is totally overlooked. Nonetheless this is a book worth reading. However, if you are interested in the persue of what really happened above 29,000 feet on the Everest summit, please don't stop at this book. Read also ""The Climb: Tragic Ambitions on Everest"" by Anatoli Boukreev and G. Weston Dewalt. I would personaly start with the Boukreev account."
4,Should cure any rational person of wanting to visit this mountain,"Covers the disastrous 1996 Mount Everest expedition which Krakauer covered for Outside magazine. This compelling story should cure all rational folks of any desire to climb Everest, and lends valuable insight into the character of those who set out to climb the world's highest peak."
5,A gripping tale,"If you have any interest in Mount Everest, climbing or real life tales of tragedy then this book is a must read. What a gripping account of a doomed ascent of Mount Everest."
4,Rare Insight into a Perilous Set of Events,"This book is both an engrossing account of a perilous journey up Mt. Everest...the ""top of the world""...and a deeper study of what drives individuals to willingly take on great, and known, risks. It is this unique balance of best-seller caliber action and deeper content that make ""Into Thin Air"" stand out for me.Krakauer's writing caters to a wide audience and he brings credibility and first-hand experience to the subject matter. When delving into the larger question of what drives people to take on risk, however, his own point of view looms large. As the title of this book includes the words, ""A Personal Account,"" this is understandable, but I found the author's personal outlook overshadowed the theme of life and risk.Overall, this is a book well worth reading. It offers a gripping account of a harrowing set of events in the loftiest areas on Earth."
5,One of the best book I ever read,I have read several books regarding everest and mountain climbing. I love this from cover to cover.
2,Forcing myelf through,"I'm on page 143 of this book and am pondering throwing it out. I've had many friends tell me this was one of the best books they had read. But, so far it is quite boring. I'll probably end up skipping every few pages until the drama hits. Then I won't feel so bad about wasting the money I spent to buy the book."
2,Great Writer / Unfair and Unbalanced Account,"Krakauer is a superb writer, as evidenced by this compelling read. The book does not appear to present a balanced or fair account of what went on during Krakauer's time on the mountain, however."
5,It took me to the summit!,A great read - one of those stories you never forget. An amazing account of the climbers on Everest that takes you inside the mountaineering world
4,Into Thin Air,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was very interesting to learn all the difficulties faced by those who climb these extreme mountains. I never realized how many other dangers were involved other than falling yet those who face the challenge are obsessivley pushed to put their lives on the line for that moment of glory at the top of the world. Sadly May 1996 took it's toll on so many, both the seasoned climbers and the less experienced. It definately makes one respect the power of nature."
4,"I enjoyed this book, and found it fun and educational.","I found the book Into Thin Air, by Jon Krakauer, very entertaining and informative. I liked the book a lot because it included all different types of genre; adventure, mystery, drama, and suspense. I thought it was a very educational book as well. Those interested in mountain climbing, and even those not interested were given important and educational information about Everest and mountain climbing in general. Considering it was based on a true story, it kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. I didn't find a slow moving or boring part in the book because it seemed to remain at it's climax from start to finish. It had increasing amounts of suspense and drama consistantly, and kept the reader interested in the book.I enjoyed this book a lot, and would recommend it for people of all ages, and people interested in all sorts of genres. This is a fun-filled and suspenseful book that all people should take the opportunity to read."
5,I read this book in four hours,"Wow! Since you already know the ending, what can he do to keepyou awake? Plenty: There are a plethora of facts about climbing,altitude sickness/difficulties, geographical rivalries and politics. Then, there are the personalities and the greed -- Sandy Pittman wasn't the only fool on the hill -- and all that hubris. Finally, there's the evocation of the tragedy itself, meticulously dissected and flawlessly tracked. This book doesn't rate a ""10"" (I can't think of many that would) but, by sheer dint of his courage and art, Jon Krakauer creates wonderful literature out of snow and ice."
5,WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!,I love mountain climbing so this book intrigued me. I would recommend it to anyone who has ever dreamed of conquering the elements.
4,Step-by-Step Protrayal of Life and Death,"Jon Krakauer came away feeling lucky to be alive and guilty at the same time for surviving. During his journey to get to the top and back down again Krakauer paints both flattering and unflattering portraits of the various primary and secondary players in this true drama. You can't help but feel admiration for the fallen leaders of the groups and scorn for those others that refused to help them.One area he does a very good job at is to bring you face to face with the steep, cold, harsh sides of the mountain. An environment devoid of air to breath and filled with biting winds. As the life and death decisions are made you start asking yourself why anyone would want to put themselves through such an ordeal. Alas we as humans do strange things for 1-2 minutes of fullfillment."
4,a heart pounding story that brings mankind down a notch,A well written story that doesn't allow one to put it down. Jon Krakauer has done something beautiful in his description of climbing Everest. It is an enlightening story that everyone should read...it is pure excitement...enjoy
3,A good read but...,"The three star rating is misleading because it's more in the 3&1/2 range. Anyway, I liked the way Krakauer told the story. Great attention to detail. But on the other hand, I didn't like the book because I just felt like he was laying all of his problems of dealing with what happened on Everest on us.This is one of those books that you'll read and be entertained, but a month later you'll remember it about as well as you would your basic hollywood blockbuster. You remember what went down, but it doesn't matter much."
5,I found Into Thin Air an interesting and exciting book.,"I thought Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer was a very good book. In a kind of backwards way, it made me want to climb Mt. Everest. The descriptions of the aclimatization exercises are fascinating. The Icafalls sounded extremely frightening and exhilarating. The fact that the author was really on the mountain gave the whole book a different sound. It gave an inside look on what each experience made him feel. I loved the descriptions, and feeling like you could be right up on the mountain with them."
2,Into Thin Air: The true Story,"Into Thin Air is a true story writen by a magazine writer and climber Jon Krakauer. Jon worte the history of Everest from how he was assigned to write a behined the scences story about it to how he stuggled to the summit and on the way down came faced with nature at it's worest. As he struggled down the mountain fighting to make it the camp he passed some of his fellow climbers who were dead or deing from the lack of oxygen and cold. Out of a group aorund 15 climbers, 6 made it back alive. When Jon returned to Seattle he felt horribly gulity and wrote this book for his friends who died on Everst."
4,Interesting Book,"This book was recommended by my son and I read it and gained a whole new insight into mountain climbing. Wow, What an ordeal! If my son ever considers it, I will lock him up, tie him up, sit on him, or whatever it takes to keep him off a mountain like that. I have great respect for the author and the impact his experience had on his life and many others."
1,Rec'd wrong book. Vendor is great and tries hard.,The vendor selling this book was great. It just wasn't the book we wanted even though we tried really hard to communicate which edition we wanted.
4,Made me glad to be near the fireplace,This book is a chilling look at human behavior in extreme conditions. Its narrative is a testimate to the self-preservation instinct and to self-sacrifice.
4,Exciting Read,"I found ""Into Thin Air"" to be a completely enjoyable and enlightening book. Mountain climbing is not a topic that ever interested me, so if a friend had not recommended this book to me, I never would have read it.Like so many others, I found myself completely into this book once I started reading. The characters, the circumstances, and the predicaments all become very real. The author tells a story of actual people facing life and death situations, and the decisions they make are the difference between living and dying."
5,The Best Book I Have Ever Read,I kon wthis sounds childish and silly but this is the best cook I have ever read. And I have read it many times in the last year. It has turned me on to climbed to the point where I have a small* library on mountaineering. Ire commend this book to anyone mountaineer/armchair moutaineer or reader. You will LOVE this book. *Small in relation to the library of congress
5,Thriller of a Lifetime,"Into Thin Air was and intense thriller of a book where action occurred every single page of the book. This book starts out with Jon, the main character, introducing himself as a reporter for Outside magazine. He goes with a large group of people to scale Mount Everest, the ultimate climbing experience. On the way there many events happen, and miraculously everybody survives. On the descent many people die in a variety of events. I think that this book is an excellent thriller and every person in the world should read it. Even though I don't know much about mountaineering, nor will I ever care, I still thought that this book was written with superb effort by Jon Krakauer. He is an excellent writer and I plan on reading his other books such as Into the Wild and some others. This story is a very influential story since it teaches people to believe in themselves and to not give up on your ultimate goal. This is an excellent book."
4,enjoyed it,I really enjoyed this book. The story was compelling and well written. I finished it in three days because I was so engrossed.
5,A perfect example of the adventure-novel genre,"Jon Krakauer does a beautiful job of recounting the terrible accident that occured on Mt. Everest. Although at some point throughout the book his poor literary skills do shine through, in this genre of writing they are not necessary. Reading this book made me realize both the beauty and anger of nature in a way which I have never thought of. I highly recommend it."
4,Great even if you know nothing about climbing.,I couldn't put the book down! It was very exciting reading. A day has not passed since beginning the book that I didn't think about the men and women who were in the Everest Disaster in 1996. This book is worth reading even if you've never been interested in climbing or Everest before.I now have a strong desire to travel to the mountain just to see it. I really admire those who dream of climbing Mt. Everest and attempt to make it. Even with all the danger and the disaster in 1996 - it makes a person ponder whether or not they could make it.
5,"Got Me, A Couch Potato, Hooked on Climbing Books","I enjoyed this book so much, I became totally hooked onclimbing books, even though I get winded going over a speedbump.Now I've read books on climbing Everest, K2, Annapurna, etc., and am a walking encyclopia of climbing.Into Thin Air remains the best book in this genre. Not a dull moment, and you feel like you are there on the mountain. Krakour's account is concise, like a good journalist, but also intensely personal, a perfect mix."
4,Why Climb Everest,"This book bears the eternal question....why do people climb this mountain?! It is a throughly engaging book. Like a train wreck, it's hard to tear your eyes away. Very well written and fast moving."
3,"A good first read of the May, 1996, disaster","Briefly, Krakauer's account of the events is no doubt accurate, but in spite of the quality fo the actual writing, the analyses and conclusions drawn leave something missing. Perhaps Krakauer's own judgment was simply altered on the mountain, as well, preventing a completely clear view of the events.Krakauer's observations don't always jive with those of the other climbers on his and other expeditions, and after re-reading the book recently, I feel Krakauer himself wasn't in position at the right time to justify the conculsions he makes.Nonetheless, a good read, but only in conjunction with other books on the same issue. Boukreev's ""The Climb"" is a far better account, and serves as an excellent follow-up to ""Into Thin Air""."
5,"Gripping, facinating adventure turned (foreseeably) tragic","I have never been interested in mountain climbing or the people who do it, and my impression of the Everest tragedy was pretty much that of a bunch of rich amateurs getting what they deserved. Krakauer, writing from his unique perspectives as one of the few skilled mountaineers on the trip, wholly draws one into the drama, tragedy, and (for some) triumph of the grueling endurance the Everest parties waged at 28,000 feet. At the end of this book, you will marvel at the stupidity and arrogance of the tourists who paid for a guided walk to the top of the world, the failure of judgment of the expedition leaders, whose ambition exceeded their and their clients abilities, and the sheer will power, determination, and combination of luck and skill possessed by the survivors. Gripping, riveting, narrative! Since reading this book, I have absorbed every related article on the subject and look forward to the IMAX film, when it comes out."
2,Writing as self-help?,"I've read Krakauer's earlier book (""Into The Wild"") and found this latter work hauntingly similar. Rather than being an unflinching account of the facts, his books seem to be based more deeply in his ongoing struggle to figure himself out. I don't know where his faith lies, but he seems tortured by the compulsions to blame (alternately; others and himself, generally the former). In both books I scanned through the paragraphs that seemed self-serving to the author. I kept reading because I found his descriptions of nature and events to be very well crafted. Anatoli's account of the expedition seems to have been written to defend against the attack by Krakauer. Even at this, Anatoli's version seemed much more factual. I appreciated Anatoli's stoicism (contrasted to Krakauer's blaming). I laughed on reading the quip: ""$6.98 - Into Thin Air"" in one of the other reviewers comments. Krakauer - Please, next time spare the psychodrama, it comes off as daytime TV set in the mountains."
4,Excellent! A page turner and very well written.,"Makes you realize how strong and mixed up human emotion, drive and ego can get. The descriptions of this unfortunate disaster are so vivid that you can sometimes feel your feet starting to frostbite."
2,Know what you are reading,"I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants to read the truth about what happen on that ill fated 1996 expedition to Mount Everest. In this book the author makes many assumptions that were not his place to make, as well as ignoring the truth when it was given to him several times. His portayal of Mountain Madness Guide Anatoli Boukreev was horribly unjust. Let it just be said that while Jon Krakauer was asleep in his tent at Camp IV Anatoli Boukreev was selflessly out in the blizzard rescuing clients from both the Mountain Madness and Adventure Consultants Teams by himself! The better book to read for a better and more truthful account of what happened would be The Climb by Anatoli Boukreev and G Weston DeWalt."
1,What a poor book...,I do not agree with the majorities of reviews: 1. Krakauer is no good writer - compare him to other classics of mountaineering 2. Just by reviewing articles and other books on the tragedy on May 10th you will find out that he keeps A LOT of events and facts out of the story. The biggest mistake probably is to present Boukreev as the scapegoat... the one guy who did more for the rescue of all the remaining climbers than ANY OTHER PERSON up on the mountain at that time. Sad that he seems to need that to create a Hollywood like drama...
4,wow not me,Great for anyone who likes adventure. Try this and find out what reaching your dreams is all about. The people who climbed would read this book and still attempt their climb.
2,Into Thin Air,"A premature and rather hysterical account of events on Everest in 1996. Gripping at the time but deeply flawed and overly emotive. For a fuller account, I recommend The Climb by Anatoli Bukreev, the true hero of the day, and A Day to Die for by Graham Ratcliffe, for a full understanding of the events on Everest in 1996. Krakauer's book is an embarrassment of inaccuracies and subjective invective, when viewed fifteen years after this avoidable fiasco."
1,THE CLIMB vs. INTO THIN AIR,"If you have or plan to read INTO THIN AIR without also reading Anatoli Boukreev's book THE CLIMB, then you are only getting one side of the story. You'd also be participating in an injustice to the unfortunate people who lost their lives on Everest, people that Mr. Krakauer would not help in their hour of need. Read both books, and one gets a clearer picture of what really took place on that mountain. ""Everyone has their side of the story, and somewhere in the middle lies the truth."""
2,"Well written; tragic, but.... so what?","Granted, it's well written, for the most part. And, yes, it's hard not to feel empathy for those who lost their lives and [moreover] for their friends and family, but.......... that empathy is tempered by the realization that these people decided to put themselves in deadly peril, NOT to explore new paths, NOR to accomplish something of benefit to humankind, but merely for RECREATION. To me, it seems terribly hubristic and self-centered, not to mention costly. In a way, this is a paean to death as the ultimate ""thrill"".A note to educators: PLEASE do not ask your students to post reviews of books you have assigned them! I'm sure I speak for many in saying that most people read these reviews for the opinions of people who have actually chosen to read these books, however much they may eventually regret the choice. Finding a review along the lines of ""this book sucked because my teacher made me read it"" rather defeats the purpose."
3,"Death at 29,028 feet","""Into Thin Air"" was a book that I didn't expect. when I read the summary, I thought it was going to be biography's of the men and woman who died. But it was way more than just that. It told the story of the whole tragedy, I didn't, however, like the history of the mountain and past expeditions. Towards the end of the book, I really started to get into it. By the end of the book, I really felt sorry for the victims and their families. I would recommend this book, but only to a person with the kind of patience to get through all the histroy. But once you are all through that, its a way worth read!!!!!!!!"
5,Excellent summer read,"This is an EXCELLENT and riviting account of the quest tosummit Everest in 1996 where a number of people died making theattempt. Jon Krakauer is an fantastic writer who tells his story in a manner which makes it IMPOSSIBLE for the reader to put the book down. The story flows from beginning middle end seamlessly, the character development is excellent, his own view as a narrator seems extremely balanced and fair given the highly charged and emotional circumstances in which the story takes place. From the dizzy socialite to the postal worker who worked two jobs to scrape together the money to attempt Everest, the group who assembled at base camp in Everest in May of 1996 makes a cast of caracters worthy of a major motion picture. In addition, the reader can learn what it is like to survive at 26,000 feet and to experience tempatures where human beings commonly freeze to death. It is, in the end however, an uplifting story. This is a must read!"
5,An astounding thriller that's bound to captivate you!,"INTO THIN AIR was an exciting novel robust with a sense of danger throughout it's pages. It is a historical documentation of tragic happenings, and as you read, it is hard to believe the events have actually occured to real life people. The most astounding aspect of INTO THIN AIR is it's intricate descriptions. Krakauer made you feel as if you were actually ascending Everest's powerful face."
4,The Everest Mission,"Every mountaineer's dream is to reach the summit of Mt. Everest. But when they had reached the summit, they have another dream- to survive. Into Thin Air is about Jon Krakauer's personal account of climbing Mt. Everest, including his every step up to Everest, the snowstorm, his unsuccessful descend, and the distressing narration of the loss of five people on his team. This is a great book for readers who enjoy adventure books and non-fiction."
3,"Too much character usage, Great Description of Ascent","Into Thin Air is a good book, yet if you don't have a character list next to you while reading this book you can easily become confused like I did. Mr. Krakauer will go on a tirade of character usage and will completely lose the reader's interest because the reader doesn't know who he is talking about. When Jon Krakauer talk's about his personal expedition to the top of Everest, he does such a good job describing the climate and surroundings that it feels like you are there yourself, climbing Everest. At these point's in the book the detail is so great that it is really inticing and interesting, it locks the reader in."
3,disorganized,"Perhaps the author intended for the book to be disorganized to more accurately reflect his mental state. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I also were deprived of oxygen. Perhaps he could have spent a little more time and put more effort into it. Had he done so, I could have rated it more highly, but as it stands, the book was adequate. It does present an accurate picture and provides insight into the highly technical and expensive journey- truly an ideal for the rich. And from the tales told, the foolhardy and inexperienced."
5,"For a balanced account, read ""The Climb""","This was a great book, albeit a little melodramatic. I just finished reading ""The Climb"" by Anatoli Boukreev and I have a whole different perspective of the diaster. Read both books, Into Thin Air and The Climb for balance."
5,Strong recomendation for The Memory Program,"The Memory Program is a concise and straightforward source of information regarding both the causes and treatments for memory loss. Dr. Devanand has taken information from his own research and personal clinical experience and has presented it in such a way that it is easily generalized to the public at large. This book inculdes discussions on the vast majority of causes, treatments, and preventive options for memory impairment. Despite the wide range of material covered, the book is organized in such a way that the reader does not get lost and is able to synthesize all the information. In short, this book is an excellent source of information not only for those people currently struggling with memory problems, but also for those interested in the prevention of such problems."
4,Works great,"Catches the black sunflower seed, but had to purchase a different plug to attached to feeder (different brands). We used a rubber plug and works fine."
3,Eh.,"Sophie B. Hawkins' Tongues and tails is really quite, well, dull. I mean, her songs have anger, but the anger is moronically displayed. This CD, to put it simply, is less than mediocre. It's some sort of messed up, whiny, rocky, PMSy, so-called album with a hint of something remotely resembling modern jazz. I regret buying this CD. Of course, this is my opinion, Ms. Hawkins can scream and yell about sex all she wants, but I'm not going to listen to it."
2,One Gem for Mining,"Overproduced and overwrought, Tongues and Tails nonetheless has one certifiable, should-be-in-everyone's-collection gem, a cover of Dylan's I Want You, which in Hawkins' version becomes a bitter, longing, slowed-down torch song. The way she spits out the line ""You know I wasn't very cute to him, was I?"" is reason enough alone to give her a listen. Three other cuts also succeed -- the infectious Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover, Before I Walk on Fire, and Saviour Child. As for the rest...she often sounds like Enya on steroids to me and the production relies way too much on synthesizers, overmix, and a really annoying tendency to use spoken dialogue. Saviour Child in particular is damaged by this last effect."
3,Review of Stroke: Recovery With Oxygen by Polly Houston,"Stroke by Polly Houston is an eye opener for someone who has had a stroke or a caregiver for a stroke victim. Written by an older lady who had a stroke, it tells you first hand about the problems that a stroke victim is subjected too. Although it is not written by from a medical research point of view, it is very helpful in trying to understand the problems of a stroke victim.I recommend it for anyone looking for solutions for stroke victims.Doug Kincaid from Kincaid, WV."
4,The Sylvers Greatest Hits...,"I have a sentimental weakness for this group, as they made an impact upon my teenage soul, back in the early through mid 1970's. I play their music, look in the mirror and see what I was, what life was, and life to me was sound. The only reason why I won't give this collection 5 stars is simple. Where's the song ""Keep on, Keeping on""? You can't find it anywhere. I can't be the only one waiting on the ""Showcase"" LP to be released to CD (hopefully re-mastered!). My favorite tunes on this collection are the following:1. Through the love in my heart (Nice mid paced song!)2. Fools Paradise (70's pop song with a message)3. Wish that I could talk to you baby! (Nice pop ballad!)4. Misdemeanor (Foster's hit - Need I say more!)If you can get it at a good price, I say, buy it!"
3,Slyvers CD,"Was present for my wife, ""Misdemeanor"" is our favorite cut (for being the disco era). Didn't think the price was right for music but it averages out. I give the album a 2-1/2 stars."
1,bubbles,"I ordered this to use for ""special"" effects in a community theater performance. It was so messy and ineffective, we did not use it. Would have returned it if it hadn't been so much trouble so we kept it and hope it will work for something in the future."
4,little known gold,this album is great! if you like Crowbar and such sludge metal bands... buy this! this little known band dishes out some great songs and music
4,Memphis Bleeks debut album shows some 'Coming of Age',"Memphis Bleek's debut album does show some coming of age for the young rapper. His debut includes many many hot beats along with solid guest lyricists like Ja Rule, Jigga, Beanie Sigel, and Noreaga. Bleek hits you with hot sh*t like 'What You Think of That' and 'I Won't Stop'. At times Bleek's lyrics can seem uninspired and just about nothing , but the beats in it save the weak lyrics. This album is something to pick up and bump real loud in your ride."
3,Some good tracks... and plenty of filler material,"memphis bleek has got a future. i heard a few of the songs (memphis bleek is..., stay alive in nyc, murda for life) and i loved them so i bought the album.. however, some of the tracks on the album sound a little rushed and dont flow so well... bleek is an awesome rapper, but this album didnt quite what i was expecting... i admit the beats are all great but the album as a whole just doesnt quite cut it. bleek has potential. maybe he'll shine on his next album."
5,Memph bleek is... da bomb,this cd will get ur car bumpin. u gots to buy it. Memphis Bleek is...is tha phattest song
2,Probably too young,"This could have been better, but this Queens cat couldn't hold it down. I think his age shows on this album, the tracks sound immature."
3,3/4 fearless,"3 1/2A relic from the brief period when trip-hop displayed artistic value, this interesting import compliments excess and campiness with diverse, sometimes astute production."
3,holds,works well holds my playstation 3 good looks good nephew likes the cool blue light which you can shut off
3,bright lights,nice little stand for the fat ps3. the led's that light up the stand are pretty bright and may not be for everyone.
5,All in the Family,"I was shocked to see this site! I happeded upon it by accident, and friend of mine at worked actually found it. Authur Alexander was my uncle, and a very great person to be around. I actually lived in his house in Cleveland, and my aunt still lives there. I never really heard him complain or say many bad things about anyone in his life. He was loved by all of us and we miss him very much. I am very happy that he touched so many people as he did our family for many years. Thanks for all of your kind words."
2,Abysmal Product Support,"Sony's product support was so bad that I decided that I would never, ever buy another product with their label on it. Within days of my purchase, the software became obsolete and they refused to update it."
2,a soap opera,"This book diverts from the earlier ones since it concentrates on the intrigues of court, rather than the adventures of the four musketeers. However, it is probably necessary to set up for the thrilling conclusion. Since this is the middle book, it is a must read, but be prepared to be bored."
3,"Well...maybe, maybe not.","If you're looking for some good rap-core, this isn't it. This band is rather bland and not really creative. Not to say they don't have promise, but it isn't their time. I would recommend P.O.D if you wanted something to really rock to. If you like it great, but I wouldn't suggest it."
5,Awsome!,"These guys rock!This cd has the adrenalin Korn, manson,limb-bizkit, I have hade the cd for about a year now and are still loving it.Highly recommend it to all hard music fans"
2,"Some nice special effects, but poorly acted / written","Contains some nice work by Harry Harryhausen in creature animation, but this movie has a very weak Harry Hamlin in the lead role (he makes Arnold in Conan look like John Gielgud). Hey, I like the mechanical owl though. Too much of this movie is also very slow-paced and even though it is essentially and sword and sandal adventure spends way too much time being talky. Jason and the Argonauts & the Sinbad movies were alot better."
5,Great Movie,"I bought this movie because I liked it when I was younger and I enjoyed it just as much. I haven't seen the remake yet, but I heard that the original is still better, and it was a great price."
3,Harryhausen's Finale,"Assisted by animator Steve Archer, CLASH OF THE TITANS would be the last movie to showcase the stop-motion magic of the legendary Ray Harryhausen. With this film Harryhausen returns to Greek Mythology and brings forth a world of the Gods of Olympus (played by Sir Lawrene Olivier, Maggie Smith, Ursula Andress, Claire Bloom), hero Pereus ( Harry Hamlin, LA LAW) , damsel in distress Andromeda (Judi Bowker) with supporting work from Burgess Meredith and Tim Piggot-Smith. There are monsters a plenty: the evil Calibos, Medusa, the two headed hound, giant scorpions and the Kraken! While not as good as his earlier foray into the world of Greek Myths, JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, still an entertaining film and fitting finale to a career on the big screen that began in 1948 with MIGHTY JOE YOUNG. A short conversation with Harryhausen is the only real extra."
4,cool flik,"It's been a long time since I've seen this movie, and it's been hell finding it again. I loved it when I was a kid, and I still think it's one of the great still-frame animation films."
3,Still a great movie,"This is still a great movie for the kids! fairly accurate as to the legend of persius, so it does bear some educational content."
4,Good movie from the 80's!,"It would have been cool to have lived during the time of the greek gods!! This is a good movie, and not bad for the era of time. It was a great deal at $6.99Watching it shows how far we have came with technology! Fun movie!"
1,Not dts audio sound track,I was looking forward to getting this. When I got it it had a cool book. When I watched the movie there is no where to change the audio. My receiver will say dts on it when playing a dts sound track. My just says prologic. Basically false advertisement. These companies make me wonder.....
5,LOVE IT!!!,"Great cd...Great band...Great music. I wish the band would get back together and create some more music. For a 3 piece band of pianao , bass & drums they have created some of the best pop alternative...and I love it."
2,Teaser book for the Power of Compassion,"This litle book of wisdom is a compilation of extracts from the ""Power of Compassion"". I give it a 3 stars because I thought it was a compilation of selected sayings from all the books and/or interviews. However, every Dalai Lama's book to me is a precious fountain of wisdom and I love all of them but I am just dissapointed with this one in terms of publication."
3,rust quickly,"It fit perfectly and looked great for all of about 2 weeks. I keep the grill covered when I'm not using it, but the heat plate still began rusting almost right away. It still functions fine, but will likely need replaced again next year."
2,Original artist would have been nice.,The sound track was ok. KISS sang their songs. Why did'nt they have the original artist sing the other songs on the sound track?Hope the movie is better then the sound track.
5,anything with kiss on it is worth buying,"from what ive seen this looks like a killer soundtrack, i would say its worth buying"
5,Nice book,"A quick and simple read, but a fun read. Nice illustrations. Cute story with a nice message. Three more words required."
2,no title,"The audio quality is sub-par because the audio sounds ""pre-high fidelity"" since the songs evidently came directly from film sound tracks; it should have been enhanced with today's technology."
1,shockingly bad,Even when this album was first released in the early 90s it sounded hopelessly dated. Time has been even less kind to this unlistenable mess: this is the worst collection of songs I've heard. As a long time fan of Lene I still only managed to listen to this twice before binning it. Avoid.
3,Does the job.,"they used to be made in Colorado, but now after I looked for them I find out they are now made in China."
3,Allen Assault Case,Case is a good started case. I like the six pockets for extra mags and tools. I use this one for my ar-15 22. Not as thick as I would have expected but does the job just fine.
3,"Not bad for the price, but it won't last long","I'm not impressed with the construction. Very light weight, and the zipper doesn't look like it will stand up to heavy use. But it's cheap, so if you need to save bucks it's worth the price. You get what you pay for."
1,Nothing Right,"First delivery was 19 days late, after I ask about it, but that was OK, I just wanted the Gun Case. Then the topper was when I received the Case to find out it was a 37 inch and NOT the 42 inch case I had ordered. And the bottom line, I was charged the price of the 42 inch Case and not the lesser price of the 37 inch. No I will not buy from them again............"
2,Don't buy this!,"I wish I had read the previous reviews before I bought this tool. I would have run the other way. First it is almost impossible to get the machine out of the styrofoam. It took two of us pulling for a couple of minutes. The fences are extremely hard to aline. The edges are extremely sharp on the top and scratch your wood. You have to push the wood thru the bit so hard because the top catches the wood and won't let it slide. I have noticed the spindle actually moves backward when running wood through. I am a professional carpenter who was lookin for a light machine to use on the jobsite, so I guess I will have to just keep looking. This machine also needs a variable speed or at least a couple of more speed settings. does not produce a clean cut on smaller bits."
2,It's only okay,"This is not a quality piece of equipment, but I liked it for two reasons: 1. The cost; it is at least $... cheaper than the cheapest shaper that I could find on the market. 2. Portability; my garage is my workshop, and I did not want an infrequently used piece of equipment (such as a shaper) taking up critical floor space. This unit fits nicely on the shelf.Another good point is the dust collection, which worked well for me.However, the fence is junk. There is no fine tuning adjustment, and it is difficult to attach feather boards in the right places. Similarly, the fine tuning on the cutter height is clunky; it works only on the way down (not on the way up). And the hole in the table top is not big enough to handle the panel raising bit that I wanted to use; I had to buy a smaller bit.But the unit did work well enough for me to build raised panel doors for my kitchen."
2,Delta is selling this?,"I purchased this without looking at the reviews, boy I wish I had. This is not up to Delta's rebutation. The fence is terrible and I consider it unsafe. The grooves on the top have too many sharp edges. Larger bits do not work with the size of the opening.The only thing I like is the thought put into the two wrenches to change the bits.(...)"
5,great and easy transaction!,This was a great and easy transaction--fast shipping and product arrived in great condition. I would definitely recommend this seller!
4,"Yes, it is cumbersome but you won't miss a step","I used this book while earning my Master of Arts in Training and Development. It is not a simple method and it will initially give you nightmares. Nevertheless you will absolutely develop instruction that captures all necessary steps and stages in the design and development of a course. I think that every true Instructional Designer should own this book.Audra M. Akins, MATDInstructional Technology Doctoral Candidate"
2,BORING!!,"This book is required for a college course. So, far I'm one week into the course and this is a horrible book to have to read. I absolutely can't focus on it. It's stlye of writing has left me not only bored, but unclear of what they are talking about. I'm sure it's loaded with information, but I can't pay attention to it to learn the information. I only hope I gain the knowledge I need from the instructor and the other matrials."
2,Ewww spiders from Mars,This really wasn't what I was expecting. Especially the part about Costa Rico. The bikers on Harleys challenging the guy to put a big hairy spider on his head. I thought there would be more factual information.
4,Good tunes for good times,"Maybe I wanted to relive my youth just a little when I bought this CD, but I'm sure glad I gave in to that nostalgic moment. The memories it has brought back to me of sitting in my room as a ""tween"" and listening for hours on end to the melodic songs on this Partridge Family album...ahhhh. The songs are well arranged and full-bodied and David Cassidy is singing. Well, there you go. My favorites being ""Umbrella Man"", ""Morning Rider on the Road"", and ""She'd Rather Have the Rain"", are all smartly written and sound so good after all these years. If you were ever a Partridge Family fan, I recommend this CD. So sit back, put on your best bell-bottoms, wallabees, and paisley shirt, and have a listen."
5,The way we Were,"The songs of the Partridge Family/David Cassidy bring back the good olds days , like the Barbra Streisand song. The quality of this record it excellent.Enjoy the music, feel the groove."
3,Unnecessary expense,It's a good idea if you have the feeder hanging high enough off the ground that a squirrel can't jump up to the suet or whatever you have hanging below. My mistake was not realizing you can accomplish the same thing much more cheaply by drilling a hole in the normal plug and using a common screw-in hook.
5,Great feeder,"This truly is a great feeder; it is sturdy and the birds here love it. Seems to be the favorite of our six feeders. The primary birds using this are the Chickadees, Nuthatches, Titmice, and the whole array of finches (house, purple, and gold). Beginning this fall the cardinals have also taken to it. Just enough room for them. I'm going to order another for the back of out house. Highly recommend."
3,The beginning of an early-music and prog-rock blend,"Gryphon was a '70s band that combined early music with rock to form an unusual but catchy prog-rock blend. The band centered around bassoon/krumhorn player Brian Gulland and keyboard/recorder/krumhorn player Richard Harvey, with guitarist Graeme Taylor and David Oberle on drums/vocals both capable players. On ""Midnight Mushrumps"", bassist Philip Nester was added and rock was added to the mix. Here you can hear the beginnings of the unique sound that reached its peak on the superlative ""Red Queen to Gryphon Three"" album. The centerpiece of the album is the 19-minute title cut. The melodies on this album aren't as memorable as on ""Red Queen"", but ""Mushrumps"" is still good. My favorite cut is the closer, ""Ethelion"".(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"
1,"Thanks again George, we knew we could count on you","The demand for the original Star Wars trilogy to be released on DVD without the Special Edition added effects was huge when the box set first came out a while back, and now they're finally here on DVD in all their original glory. The only thing is that these versions are identical to the laserdisc versions from way back when; meaning non-anamorphic widescreen and Dolby 2.0. Yeah, I know what you're thinking; that Star Wars fans should be happy with what they get, but it's inevitable that all six films will be re-released later on with the original trilogy the way it was meant to be in anamorphic widescreen and Dolby 5.1. You know it will happen, as long as there is money to be made George Lucas will milk the franchise for every cent he can. The best thing to do is avoid these upcoming releases, and hope against hope that Lucas will release the un-altered original trilogy in the format that it deserves to be seen in."
4,Awesome movie.,"Its an awesome movie, but the good thing is Lucas cleans this video up in the Special Edition, otherwise I'de hate it. The part with the Wampa ice creature is on of my favorite parts. I rate this 4 stars."
1,"Total waste of money and a big, big insult to the Star Wars fanhood","Tell me something, wouldn't you agree if Fox, or Lucasfilm, releases the original versions together on a DVD box and not separately with the extra special edition DVD? What is wrong with them? All Star Wars fans already bought the trilogy DVD in 2004, with the bonus DVD and everything. Now they're going to make us buy the movies separately so we can see the original releases and compare them with the updates?I don't want to think that George Lucas came out with this idea. This is too much snake oil's salesmanship and cash cowing, even for him. I encourage fans to not to buy these movies separately. Either wait for the original theatrical release DVD pack or, better enough, the 6 DVD Saga pack...because they're going to release it!"
1,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed that I must buy the special edition discs (which I already own) in order to finally enjoy the original version of the films on dvd. I am also sure that Lucas will decide to release another ""extra-special"" edition in another two years that will recycle this same nonsense over again with some slight modification. This formerly die-hard fan will no longer be pushing cash over the counter just to line George Lucas' pockets. If a non-scam version of the original films is released (at a non-insane price) on DVD, then I might consider buying them at that time."
1,"The ""original"" versions are 4x3 letterboxed...","The ""original"" versions are 4x3 letterboxed...For anyone with an HDTV or widescreen regular TV, these DVDs are a major disappointment. The original versions are matted from their original 2.35:1 aspect ration for 4x3 TVs, so they look like crud on an HDTV or other widescreen TV.They appear to be made from the same transfers used for the laserdiscs.The other versions, from 2004, appear to be identical to the DVDs previously released."
3,Why does George Lucas have so little regard for the Original?,"Do not get me wrong. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is very good Science Fiction / Space Opera. But, it is not in the same class as the original Star Wars movie (Episode IV). Somehow, George Lucas got a little off the track in putting this second movie together. The re-do of this movie that Lucas did in the 1990s is worse than the original version.Personally, I do not believe that Lucas ever understood the phenomenon of the original Star Wars movie.Oh, well. Do see this movie. Just, do not expect the same magic that the original Star Wars had."
2,why complain?,Well basically because we're being jipped from having 5.1 and the best image possible. instead we are getting a dated 2.0 audio track and no anamorphic.All we ask for is the improved sound track from the special edition release and the cleaned up footage!!! They already did it...we just want it minus the horrific additions Lucas made for his kids!-edit- ohhhh the agony!!! people have already ripped this on the internet and made it anamorphic themselves!!!!
5,Best of Both Worlds,"As a long-time Star Wars fan I wouldn't think of getting any of the original trilogy without also the theatrical version, which is one of the main reasons why so many people are upset over the blue-ray releases. The Empire Strikes Back is easily my favorite of the six movies and although a few spots were cleaned up in the 'special edition' I can't bring myself to watch it due to the change in Boba Fett's voice. This is a great pair to have for any fan as it tries to appease both generations, something that Lucas doesn't seem to care about anymore."
5,Greatest Movie Ever Made,This is by far the best of all the Star Wars movies.It's darker and full of excitment. I would recommend this toall sci/fi fans.
4,"Original edit good, new version horrible","It's amazing how George Lucas went from genius to bozo in just a few years. The ""improved"" star wars is unwatchable. Horrible. I didn't know the best movie of all time could be butchered this badly."
1,Move along. These aren't the DVDs you're looking for.,"If you love the original Star Wars trilogy as much as me, it is time to send a loud and clear message to Lucas that you will not endorse a subpar, inferior product. Do not get too excited when you pop this DVD into your player to watch on a widescreen TV. The 1980 version will appear as a tiny, low-resolution image. It is a non-anamorphic transfer (which in 2006 is NOT an industry standard), so it is NOT enhanced for 16x9 viewing. Get ready to enjoy Star Wars like you never have before - as if you were watching it through a mail slot!!!Boycott this DVD until Lucasfilm acknowledges and corrects this. This trilogy's most loyal fans deserve better."
5,Love to listen to Kci and JOJO,The X album by the brothers kci and jojo is fantastic I mean you will enjoy every track on the album just as I did when I continuosly played it over and over again.
5,the kind of danceable album I liked the most,"Although, I haven't got the sylver's album yet, I must confess that this album is 2001's one accrding to the reviews of the other customers.But I have the chance to listen and watch the videos of their hit singles: ""turn the tide"", ""forever in love"" and ""forgiven""in a german channel. the kind of music I love the most. Sylver's music has a singular thing that I called ""MAGIC"". I really can't help moving to the sound of their beat. It's melodic and the voice of Sylvy added a plus to the music, very sensual and innocent.I'm really unlucky not to have their album and if someone could help me to get a copy of their album, I woud be very thankful. Go ahead Sylver!!"
4,Spilling Memories,"A feel-good read for those who like weddingsThis story takes the reader into the wedding as it happens. It can trigger memories that the reader may have from weddings that they have attended. Maya, the narrator and main character of the story, tells the story in a way so that the reader can easily visualize what she is describing.Great illustrations that have a real-life feel to them. True Mexican traditional wedding."
3,One MAJOR missing piece,"Sorry I have to break the 5-star-spell here. How you could put together a ""Best of"" for OMD and not include ""Men from Earth""'s FLY AWAY HOME is beyond me!!! It's a moral outrage! It's worse than torture!!! It's.... okay, I'm messin'. But still, that is a terrific piece, their greatest in my mind, on all counts, and could easily have been in this package in lieu of ""Jackie Blue"". Never understood the popularity of that song, whimsical though it is. Anyway, do get Men From Earth just to hear, or at least to hear, FLY AWAY HOME. Country Rock at it's best."
3,A bit dissappointing...,"There is no doubt Jason Mraz is a creative and original artist. I loved Waiting For My Rocket to Come, and I was really looking forward to listening to his new cd. After hearing ""Wordplay"" I thought that this cd would be a lot like his previous cd, but I was wrong. There are about 3 songs in total that are upbeat. The rest are rather boring and sound unlike what I would expect from Jason. All of the songs really are just OK. I can't say that I really love, or even really like any particular song on this album. Most of it sounds like a lounge act. In one song, it even sounds like there is an opera singer in it. His writing is still very creative and original, and I love that about his music, but I really didn't feel that southern hip-hop folk kind of beat that he had previously. Really, I would pass on this album and just stick with WFMRTC."
2,Blecch.,"I have listened to this album countless times because it is on the co-op playlist at the store where I work. At first I thought, ""This is nice. Catchy songs, decent voice, not too in-your-face yet artistic."" But through repeated exposure I soon learned its true nature: tame and lame. I'll give Mr. Mraz credit for cuteness and apparent sincerity, but he is just a one-boy boy band, and this album should only play on soft-rock stations. So basically, if you like Jack Johnson, you'll like this."
1,Just bland,"I'll keep it short for anyone wondering whether they should or should not buy this album. In short, don't. There are no hits on this album, and the music gets annoying very quickly. DMB's latest album Stand Up falls into the same category. No real hits, no good melodies...although DMB have like 20 albums out, Jason Mraz is already done with just 2."
2,Mr. A-ZZZZZZZzzzzzz,"Dextrous wordplay doesn't come close to his smug self-absorption. The most un-sexy artist to muse about sex since Adam Levine, his sophomoric cramming of too-many-puns-per sentence showcases his contrivance over deft, gauche over piquancy. This is humiliating on all levels - like bestowing a record contract to Jimmy Fallon. If his preoccupation with teenage sex seems congruous with his goofy frat boy geekiness, it makes it more depressing that he ain't got the skills. It's abundant enough to renovate your credence in Elvis Costello. My grade: C-"
5,Whats up with MRAZ??,"I love this cd. I def. felt that I got my moneys worth. I like every song on the album and that doesnt happen often anymore with the crap coming out today. Some people are complaining that he ""sold out"" b/c hes not focusing on his guitar skills on Mr.A-Z as much as he did on WFMRTC. But I feel that hes already proven himself as a guitar player and on this album he shows his vocal range, which is amazing, and a trip to listen to."
1,disapointed,Not nearly as good as his another cd of his that I have. I listened to it once and threw it away!
2,Buy Waiting for My Rocket to Come instead,"I waited for this cd to come out for a long time since ""Waiting for my Rocket to Come""- my favorite cd in my large collection. However, I was greatly disapointed with this cd. The only songs that really match up to the greatness of the other cd are ""Plane"" and ""Live is Wonderful"" which you could just download off the internet. ""Wordplay"" is an okay track but pretty run of the mill pop. It only gets worse from there. His tracks that start out good drone on too long and anoyingly. His other tracks sound simply like washed up pop."
2,Definitely Not Jason,"My friends brother got me absolutely hooked on Jason about a year ago. Waiting For My Rocket to Come, Jason's debut album, spent many weeks in my cd player and when I discovered Live At Java Joe's (by far Jason's best cd) I declared myself and avid Jason fan and was counting down to the release of Mr A-Z..So much so that we drove 35 minutes down the beach on vacation to get it the day it came out. This trip, however, turned out to be quite a disappointment. Mr A-Z is completely different from the mellow, mainly acoustic stylings of Jason and encompasses many genres which Jason just doesn't work with. His voice is still amazing, and a few of the songs are highly addictive (ie. Wordplay) but the CD as a whole, if you like Jason and his style, in my opinion, bombs."
4,"Overall, worth the wait!","I had pre-ordered my copy of Mr. A-Z and couldn't wait for it to come on Tuesday. I listened to the entire thing right away, and, overall, I love it. ""Geek in the Pink"" and ""Clockwatching"" have been in my head for three days straight now- ""Clockwatching"" might make my list of all-time best songs by anyone ever.However (there had to be a ""however,"" right?), I do think this album is over-produced. There are so many times that Mr. Mraz's voice is altered-- why, why, why? He has one of the best voices out there, and it's much better in its natural state. And some of the songs are wonderful and then do something weird at the end; ""Did You Get My Message"" is a perfect example. Great song, and then this awful outro.However, it is still Jason Mraz, which is better than anything else out there today. I'm sure it will get better the more times you hear it, just like WFMRTC."
5,This guy is a major songwriter,"I've listened to a lot of great songwriters carefully, from Frank Loesser to Paul Simon to Sting, and attention must be paid to Jason Mraz: ""Life is Wonderful"" is one of the best songs I've heard in years. Lyrically, it reminds me a bit of ""Less is More,"" by Rupert Holmes (another great songwriter). Musically, I love the way it builds in rhythm and emotion. For this song alone, the CD is worth owning, but there is much more to cherish here.I wish Jason Mraz a long and happy career. And I hope this kind of literate songwriting craftsmanship will be heralded and treasured. More songwriters should aim this high.One last thing: This guy can really sing, too!"
3,It's not that bad,"This book may not be Tom Clancy's best, but I really didn't think it was that bad. I think he had some strong characters but the story dragged in some places. I'm not sorry that I bought and I would recommend it with a warning: It's a little hard to follow, so you have to read more than one chapter at a time."
5,squirrel proof birdfeeder,The Yankee Flipper is the 1st squirrel proof birdfeeder that I have owned that really works. We have had the feeder for several weeks and have never seen a squirrel beat it. We have not been required to recharge the battery at all.It is entertaining to watch the squirrels try to feed from the feeder also.
5,this one works!,This bird feeder is excellent. It has held a charge for almost a month and is not showing signs of needing one yet. And it has had a large number of squirrels trying it out. The squirrels spilled so much seed that it caused a problem with rats coming up to eat the seed on the ground. Now there is hardly any seed on the ground. I highly recommend this feeder. Donna
5,Droll Yankee squirrel flipper bird feeder.,This is a replacement. We have hundreds of squirrels around because we back up to a wooded area. They monopolize the bird feeders and we don't like feeding them so a daughter gave us the original flipper. It's so much fun to watch them trying to beat the mechanism. They must try it daily because they seem to know as soon as it needs charging and won't flip them off.
3,keeps the squirrels and birds away,"Oh yes, it keeps those pesky grey squirrels away, but the birds are not really interested either. I had a lot of activity with my regular feeder but hated the squirrels eating all the food. Now I have very little activity and I think Id rather deal with the squirrels than not have any of my birds"
4,"It works, not a lot better than other options though","Pros:- As a squirrel proof feeder it works, period.- Also, it holds a lot of seed and keeps it protected from the elements so you don't have to refill too often.- Well made, should last a while.- Easy to use and set up.- Battery lasts a long time.- Allows large and small birds to feed.Cons:- Battery powered. Do you really need a battery powered bird feeder?- For what it is, it's overpriced. Lots of equally effective and cheaper options out there.- Once the battery needs to be replaced, you might as well buy a new feeder because the battery isn't cheap.I like it but I think the ""over engineering"" raises the price too much. Check out the Squirrel Buster Plus bird feeder before making a decision, I like it a lot better and it's way cheaper. I will continue to use it but once the batter is gone forever I'll buy a different one."
2,Mediocrity,"WARNING: This book's basis is that for things to be fair and equal for everyone, we must all tend to mediocrity.What I hear from this book is:1. The disruptions on the family (parent's television time) by being forced to help their children do homework (learn to read, write and understand mathmatics) is atrocious!2. Children should be allowed the freedom of an unfettered mind. To discover the world on their own instead of being forced to learn from other's mistakes.3. Homework limits learning on a massive scale by taking time away from activities that would be more productive - like hanging out with friends playing games (like World of Warcraft).I feel like singing ""We don't need no education...teachers leave them kids alone!"""
4,Good Intro to Chinese Vegetarian Cooking,"This book does a good job of introducing Chinese Vegetarian Cooking, by discussing methods, equipment, and includes an ingredients glossary. The recipes are delicious, and healthy, and generally easy to prepare. Most ingredients can be purchased at a reasonably stocked grocery store. We use it regularly, and find it's creative recipes both tasty and inspiring experimentation. We especially like the Hot Pepper Rice Sticks with Peanuts. Yummy!!!"
1,I have never made even one recipe from this book. Why buy it,"I cook Chinese and other ethnic vegetarian dishes nearly every day. Yet this book never once tempted me. I found the recipes to be mundane, even boring and the seasonings inadequate and uninspired. Exotic ingredients, sure, but they're not always available. And the authors' sermonizing about low-salt soy sauce and low-fat oil and other unnecessary instructions to make an otherwise exciting and healthful cuisine simply tasteless truly offended me. Aren't I old enought to choose my own soy sauce?"
3,On the fence,"This keyboard is consistent when using with a MacBook Pro. The functions change without notice, not all keys are responsive. It was enough for what I need at this time. It is light and convenient but you get what you paid for. Perhaps would be better with other OS."
3,almost ok for Sibeilus on Macs,"As for many folk, it'd be nice to have a numeric keypad for mac laptops for well established shortcuts when using software. In my case it was for Sibelius (great for music notation). There were mixed reports about Mac compatibility in Amazon. My experience: On a MacBook Pro (2010, Snow Leopard), most of the keys were interpreted correctly after plugging in and ignoring the keyboard recognition popup (the Enter key was misrecognised, and the arrangement of the top row of keys was off by one -- a little off-putting). On my old PowerBook G4 (Leopard), in textedit the numbers were interpreted correctly, but in Sibelius almost nothing was correctly interpreted. Ah well -- I'll keep looking; the Adesso arrived today and will go back to Amazon today. (Interestingly, the Adesso site has a tag for this indicating MacOS compatibility, but in the spec listing only lists various Windows OS.)"
4,Worth the read,I think this book is great if you have had the opportunity to learn from Dr. Sapolsky. The only thing I did not like was that the pages were stuck together. They were never properly cut in a portion of the book. I tried to pull them apart and tore a few pages. I went back and cut the rest.
1,DON'T EVEN BOTHER,Do not buy this product. I couldn't install the drivers since the files were corrupt. Wasted 3 hours of my time trying to fix it. I even took it to my IT guy and even he couldn't fix it. We tried to use the drivers from the website but even those wouldn't work for some compatibility issues with Windows XP.
3,Good fix for the price.,This product is exactly what I needed to fix an old laptop. The USB ports had been broken off the motherboard. I was lucky there was one port that still worked because the USB card needs power supplied from a powered USB port. If you want to use this as your only USB port setup any gadget that needs a powered port will not work with this card. Other than that pretty good for the price.
4,"Fine, but non-slip backing peels off","One year later I am still happy with the item, gives extra counter space and doesn't go anywhere. Didn't give it 5 stars because the non-slip surface is peeling off and I will probably have to look for a new one to stick on next year.This is a big item that needs to be put away every time you use the stove - make sure you really need the counter space other wise it's a hassle."
2,Waited and Waited!!!,"I have been waiting to see this film...I am so glad that I waited for it to come out on DVD...this movie was one of the strangest I had seen in a long time...:( I quickly became uninterested in the plot of this film. It jumped around way too much and the premise was just weird!!! The trailers really have a way of sucking you into ""wanting to like a film"" and then when you get there to watch them...they suck...some of them. This was not a film that I could stand to watch all the way through...I turned it off!!!! Ben has got to get another agent....this is a good actor going to waste...even his talents could not pull this one out of the water. Gilgi...now this!!! What the hang is next!! Save yourself Ben!!!"
2,Another one bites the dust...,"Basically this movie suffers from flawed science, predictability, too many coincidences, poor script and dialogue. It is another Hollywood shallow and mindless movie similar to Timeline which is also another major flop. If you are over 14 years old don't bother."
1,A complete fiasco.,"Another butchered Philip K Dick story turned into a big budget chase action movie with a hole-fille plot to keep adolescent audiences awake. No thinking is required when watching this movie.The essence of Mr. Dick's story about the nature of humanity and memory has been stripped and replaced by Hollywood empty glossy action scenes.Wooden acting by Ben Affleck, and Mr. Woo's cheesy signature dove shots makes this movie a complete fiasco, enough to make any true Philip K. Dick fan sick.Avoid if your IQ has triple digits."
2,Interesting idea but......,"This is the sort of movie you could watch on a bus or a plane, or in a hotel room if you were desperate for something to watch. A good time filler and mildly entertaining, but not much else. The story idea is interesting enough but the movie itself doesn't really have staying power. 5 minutes after you've watched it you struggle to remember what the movie was all about. I must confess my main interest in seeing it was for the motorcycle chase, that didn't disappoint me, although the sound effects for the bike sounded a bit fake.But don't get me wrong, I wasn't disappointed in the movie. But that's because I didn't really expect too much out of it to begin with. And neither should anybody else who wants to see this movie."
3,more like 3.5 stars,"this movie, though a wonderful movie, was dissapointing in its plot. i fealt that it could have gone further. ben affleck did wonderful acting though! i would see it, yes, but put it in the top 50 movies? probably not."
1,don't,"uma and ben dont have chemistry. michael (ben) has his brain deleted so he has to figure everything out. he had fancy computers, a total copy off of minority report is this supposed to be something new, exciting. it wasn't"
2,The action is faster than the plot holes,"Fun to watch, as Woo throws the action at you faster than you can spot and think about (most of) the plot holes. However, thinking about it after the fact will create a list of unexplained plot holes longer than your arm.OK for two hours of brain-dead viewing. Just don't ponder it afterword, it will completely fall apart with just a few minutes of basic thought. In other words, it was just how I expected it."
1,The movie title describes the gig,"Like John Woo's other American films, ""Paycheck"" shows none of the innovation, excitement, storytelling or other qualities that made such movies as ""Hard Boiled"" so incredible. ""Paycheck"" is a science fiction movie with no science, an action movie with very little action, a romance without any passion. Even the McGuffin, which should be super cool, is just blah and unexciting. The film makes no sense, includes plot holes aplenty, and doesn't have enough energy or fun to compensate. Affleck, Thurman, Giametti - all of them are good actors that have made far better movies. It's not their fault; lazy scripting and direction are the culprits here. Spend your paycheck on a better movie."
2,"Nothing impressive, simply ordinary","Like ATB, Mark Adams Allison really doesn't have much to offer in the world of trance music. Every song on ""Star Machine"" uses the same beats and female vocals that any other dj would use. The songs aren't terribly bad. They are catchy and I do like the female vocals he used but otherwise this cd is simply too average and lacks the kick that djs like Paul Oakenfold, DJ Tiesto, and Paul Van Dyke adds to their music. The cover of Til Tuesday's ""Voices Carry"" definitely could have used a punch in the stomach. I guess for anyone looking to check out trance music ""Star Machine"" would be a good beginner but overall I would rather recommend Paul Van Dyk's ""Out There and Back"" than this coma inducing cd."
3,Homegirl Should of Kept Silent,This cd is below average. I just wasn't feeling her. I enjoyed one track and that was Saddest Day track 17. Now being a consumer spending my money. I expect to enjoy atleast half of the joint. To bad I cant say that about Foxy Browns latest effort. One Love.
3,Not Much Better Than Yo Average Brown,"Fox Brown, that eccentric Queens rapper, has laced us with another album. Unfortunately, it's not all it should and could have been. Not that I'm a hater, but Foxy never really could rap, as we have already seen on 'Chyna Doll'. 'Broken Silence' is just that little bit better. WHile some trackz like 730 light up the album, other wack tracks really let it down. One of the singles, B.K Anthem, is just plain stupid if ya ax me, and Oh Yeah ain't much better. And the last track sound a lil too much like 2Pac's Until The End Of Time.I prefer to recognize Foxy's realer trackz such as her brilliant role on Affirmative Action. This new album is kinda fukked up, which I can't say for AZ's or Cormega's new joints"
1,poo!,YEAH SHES SO GOOD NO ONE WILL GIVE HER A RECORD DEAL...SHES SO GANGSTER SHE WANTED A TRUTH WITH LIL KIM.SHES SO TOUGH SHE GOT BEATS FROM REMY AND JACKI O FOR RUNNING HER MOUTHSHES SO TALENTED...TRINA COULD WHIP HER BUTT IN A RAP STREET BATTLE.FORGET HER MAN...SHES WASTED AND PAST IT. GO BUY KIM AND TRINAS NEW ALBUMS.
3,"Nice CD, but the lyrics get to you after a while....","This is overall a good CD, definetly better than Chyna Doll, I am not sure if I would say better than Ill Na Na. The songs are overall pretty good, just I wish she did not have to remind us every 10 seconds that she is ghetto or hood. I think I got the point after the first 50 times she mentioned it. All the lyrics are about how she is so hood, and how she is suffering and has thought about suicide, but yet she still considers herself the best rapper. The songs beats are still good and will get stuck in your head, just the lyrics are her pesamistic."
1,Why would Lou Gramm want people to hear this?,"Lou Gramm was with a group called Blacksheep before Foreigner. By that time he was demonstrating talent. Before that, where was any glimpse of a future rock star? There isn't a good song or vocal performance to be found here."
3,kool,"kool speakers, i bought them them just to replace my stock blowned out one's i have from my 92' accord am using a high bypass to filter out the bass on them .. bass comes from the rear ! thx for reading ! any comments pls feel free !"
2,LITTLE EFFORT FROM MILTON,"KIND OF MIDDLE OF THE ROAD OFFERING FROM LITTLE MILTON, NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS HIS ORIGINAL STUFF HE RECORDED IN THE 1950'S AND EARLY 60'S. I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS CD, SINCE LITTLE MILTON MADE SOME GREAT BLUES MUSIC EARLY ON. SKIP THIS ONE AND GET HIS GREATEST HITS INSTEAD"
1,Avoid!,Spammers are promoting this movie with mass emails. Do not purchase! Some of the gushing reviews below look like fakes written by spammers as well.
2,A well written but unedifying work,"I was recommended to read this book. I looked forward to it and enjoyed the first chapters. Once my interest was caught, I became disappointed time and time again at the moral decline in the book. As many readers, I have a vivid imagination and felt assaulted by the acts committed in my mind by the characters. Literature entertains and teaches us, but it should not be at the cost of obscene desensitization to the reader. I would have liked to give this book a higher rating, but I was left more harmed than benefitted upon reading it."
2,A Frightful Story,"A ghastly, horrifying story depicting the absolute chaos resulting from all but one person in a city going blind. As you can imagine, ALL systems broke down, people suffered terribly, deaths were frequent and gruesome. The love and caring of the one sighted person, the doctor's wife, was the only comforting thread in the story.The format and writing were just as difficult to stomach as the storyline - interminable sentences, and paragraphs, sparse and inadequate punctuation.Revolting as the scenes and events described were, I kept on reading as I had to know if there would be any reprieve for those poor souls."
3,"Interesting premise,.....but","I read the book first, then saw the movie. The movie was just""o.k.""--it left out some of the story, but that was probably due to editing and movie time.The book, however, had sentences and paragraphs running together. This could be because of the translation. The story also ""droned"" on and on so I had to skim thru alot of it.On the positive side, though, the story idea was thought-provoking and had you thinking; if this happaned to me, what would I do??"
4,good read,"I found that this was a really interesting book. Something that kept me constantly interested. There is one thing that really bothered me as I was reading this. It is actually quite hard to read. There is basically no punctuation. I went through a whole page of the book and there was not one period, there are no quotes, every thing is seperated by commas. It was not something that was to horrible, but when trying to read a conversation between people it is very easy to get lost. Other than grammer I thought this was a decent book, but not the best ending. I think it deserves 3 1/2 stars and I would recommend it for a weekend read. Enjoy!"
4,Engrossing,Jose Saramago's writing is absolutely brilliant. I could not put down this book and i felt like I was living in the nightmare with the characters. A great first Saramago read if you haven't yet experienced his style.
2,"High hopes, low return",The Blindness metaphor was forced and strained. Two stars because I was able to stick with it to the end and it kept me away from the TV. Hard to believe they saw fit to make a movie out of it.
2,What Were They Thinking?,"My first thought after finishing BLINDNESS was ""Certainly someone in the world wrote something more worthy of a Nobel Prize!"" The prize must be as political as its critics claim it is because this book's plot was at the level of a high-school senior's attempt at fantasy. It plodded along through some of the most stilted and ineffective prose I've ever read. Though I finished the novel, my disappointment in the Nobel Prize Committee was such that I threw the book across the room and have yet to pick it up. What a waste! I'll save myself the trouble of wading through any more of Mr. Saramago's work."
1,Saramago continues to disappoint me,"For a nobel prize, Saramago continues to disappoint me. I had read ""Seeing"" and thought that the author's lack of creativity was particular to that book. Blindness is another flop. No depth in the characters. Very weak and unrealistic plot. For example, why would the only person that do not go blind chose to submit herself to sexual humilliation instead of leading, right from the beginning, the revolt against the thieves that control the food supply? You would think that sight would make her a powerful leader, but yet she takes action until after she and other women are raped by a group of blind men. How pathetic. A huge credibility gap there. I have wasted my time enduring two books of Saramago's mediocre writing. Do not waste your time."
1,Too Savage,Horrific read and too graphic for my taste. Our book group did this book and many could not read beyond the first 100 pages.
1,I couldnt do it.,"I was excited to get this book, the subject matter was interesting to me. I couldnt get past the punctuation and lack of sentence structure, no he said she said, it was all one huge run on sentence and I couldnt get over that to enjoy it. I felt like I was 10 years old and trying to hold my breath underwater as long as I could while playing Tea Party in the shallow end, and you all stare at eachother and try to enjoy yourself until you have to take that breath and come up to the surface. I was drowning in this authors choice of format, and I wanted to enjoy it so much!!!!"
2,The idea of this story was good.,"I can see why it is a good and thought-provoking book, but I find that it is not realistic enough in telling the frustrations of a suddenly blind person. It sounded easier to be inexplicably and abruptly blind than I would imagine it to be. Basically the epidemic was simplified to the extent that I thought the book was ridiculous. This story is really like a dream.What I found was not ridiculous but quite true was how uncivilized humans can be if they were being tested. A thousand years of civilization can easily be brought down in an instant."
5,Five stars for the dog of tears.,"This is another boonie dog book review from Wolfie and Kansas. ""Blindness"" by Jose Saramago is a bit deeper than most of the books we review. However, not only is ""Blindness"" a powerful book for noncanine animals of primate derivation, but there are some aspects of the book that appeal to our species.""Blindness"" is about a plague that turns humans blind, causing human society to collapse. This book shows that a species which relies primarily upon one sense, sight, is inferior to a species that can also get by with highly developed senses of smell and hearing. Indeed, in some places in ""Blindness"", it seemed that packs of dogs were about to inherit the earth.Canine readers will also be pleased that Saramago introduces a scene-stealing canine character, ""the dog of tears"", late in the book. This dog displays more moral sense than many of the human characters, and provides some respite from the novel's compelling, but generally grim, tone."
3,blindness,Watched the movie first so had to have the book answered some questions i had after the movie its a good book
2,Not a quilt,"I was disappointed in this book. These are not quilts, but wall hangings, so to me the title is misleading. I also thought the book was too theme oriented with regard to the quilted wall hangings. I inherited alot of handkerchiefs and wanted to make a large quilt."
5,book,"Book was received very promptly and in excellent condition. Not quite what I was looking for, but did get some ideas from here on how to use my hankiers...would order from here again.....^i^"
3,good for young children,"I purchased a number of books related to Navajo culture for my step-daughter. She just turned 11; this book was cute, but VERY short and aimed more at a second grade level instead of 5/6 grade level."
3,pricey and disagreeably shrinkwrapped together,"Other than vanilla, almond extract is the other necessary extract to stock for baking especially Italian baking."
3,Not Thrilled.,"As a former fat child, I already know the devastating effect being overweight can have on one's psyche. Reading this book just reminded me of my miserable childhood and of the horrors my daughter must be experiencing. In fact, I haven't been able to finish the book because it's so upsetting. Maybe there's some comfort and positive advice in later chapters--I hope so."
3,"Educating, but the logic needs work","This book doesn't provide an inescapable chain of logic leading to Regan's conclusion. Few people will be convinced of his position out of pure reason unless they were headed that direction already. However, the book is good for educating the general public about what goes on in the animal use businesses. Most people are overly optimistic about the usual procedures, and if they were more aware they might reduce their animal consumption or boycott the worst companies."
2,It is going nowhere....,"I read this book because it was frequently mentioned to be (together with the Lord of the Rings) one of the books that are at the root of modern fantasy. In my opinion this book could be placed in other categories as fantasy. It has nothing to do with the sort of novels i consider fantasy. Yes, mister Peake can describe things in an excellent way, and his world does keep some promise. But in this first novel he does very little with it. So i guess i won't read the next (unless i am completly without other interesting books to read). this definitely is not my cup of tea and if you like books written for example by Tolkien, Jordan or Martin, you should get this from the library and try it for free instead of buying."
1,"Seventh-day Adventist, not a Christian","While this book is a testimony of a man true to his faith during hard times, his faith is not the faith of a Christian. He was a Seventh-Day Adventist who believed that he had to keep the law of Moses to be accepted by God into Heaven. He lived through the whole war keeping the weekly Sabbath day of rest and abided by dietary laws of Moses.This book should not be touted as a ""Christian"" book, but rather a Seventh-Day Adventist history because they are NOT one and the same.For a stirring memoir of a Christian German family during WW2, you may enjoy One Woman Against the Reich."
5,Zen and the Art of Professional Coaching,"Ms. Craddock does a brilliant job of taking us through the often painful process of finding ourselves and then bringing the best of ourselves to the workplace. The Authentic Career is about finding and living the authentic self. It brings us back to the things we might have once been told by a well-meaning friend or a self-help lecture; it makes real and fleshes out exactly what we need to do to work through core issues of our identity and find our ""true bliss"" in the workplace.What better person than Ms. Craddock to show us the way. She went from making million dollar business deals to working with mental patients to try to find her bliss and to bring the fruits of her labors to us, in a very readable,usable form. I have benefitted greatly from reading this book!"
3,I no longer view negative co-workers the same.,"There is a section in Ms. Craddoock's book that hits home with me. I could not understand for the life in me why co-workers sometimes took a dislike for others on the job for no apparent reason. According to this book, it turns out that individuals bring a lot of baggage from their childhood to work. One person in this book admitted to not liking their co-worker because they resembled a relative who had mistreated them in the past. Is that wild or what?"
1,Review What ?????,"I can not review the Lentek PD01C dog trainer that I ordered. I was sent a different type of dog trainer/repeller without contacting me. The unit I got doesn't even have a strap, is smaller, and doesn't work against barking dogs. This review is for Amazon.com. I am unhappy. I should have been contacted before I was sent a substitute. Now to send it back I have to pay shipping and a 20% re-stocking fee. So I have to spend more money for something I didn't order to get back part of my money. Amazon.com you suck."
3,Bigger than you can imagine,"I had read reviews about the sizing of this item, but I bought it anyway. It is way bigger than a 'small' should be. I really needed a soft pouch to hold a 3/4 lens for my olympus P-2 but this item wasn't ever going to fit in my handbag. The lens would have been swimming in it too. I returned it. The company was aces about letting me return it. Very, Very nice."
4,Great little TV...,"I bought the 1.8"" TFT model and it works just fine..the stations come in nice and clear and the sound is decent too. I like the built-in stand and input/output jacks. I had a Casio and this ones much nicer. A little larger than some but still pocket sized."
2,50% breakage,"Heard the broken glass rattling when I got the box out of the mailbox. The worst packaging I have ever seen. However, Amazon issued a refund quickly, so I got over it."
3,It's difficult to wash it since it's narrow and long. .,You can't reach to the bottom to wash it. Looks and feels are just OK. Don't like them.
3,...Not THAT bad.,"For band collectors this will a needed addition. For others, skip it and pick up the classic Children or Carved in Sand."
3,If you've heard and loved 'Lucky'...,"When I first bought this album I was a little disappointed- the only Bif Naked song I had heard was 'Lucky', and I was hoping for more of the same. So people who are only familiar with Bif from the Buffy soundtrack will be in for a surprise- 'Lucky' has a totally different vibe to the other songs on the album. But 'I Bificus' is still worth a look. They're the kind of songs that get under your skin- in a good way. You find yourself singing them without realising you were thinking about them. I particularly liked 'I Died' and 'Any Day Now', but 'Lucky' remains my fave."
4,smooth and melodious,"bif naked comes out with some great melodies. she has such a soulful smooth and beautiful voice and she has good range. the lyrics are both juvenille at times and clever at others. she does sound like no doubt's gwen stefani at times but with my collection of 600 cd's how can you not cross old territory?bif's strengths lie in the fact that she comes across as innocent and worldly at the same time. her voice is soulful, genuine and passionate and her songs rock. this is defineitely something different from the norm that is pretty damn good."
5,Emiliano makes good!,"I must admit, I really had no idea that Eduardo Verastegui could sing. I came to his television works rather late, enjoying his youthful irresponsibility in the Galavision telenovela ""Sonadores"", and his rather stellar yet disturbing dual roles as Emiliano and Mauro in ""Alma Rebelde"". He conveys his roles well, proof positive that there can indeed be the ""artistic trinity"", as he can look good, act good, and after listening to the CD, sound good.My favorite on the CD is ""Por la falta de tu Amor"". Offering something decent to listen to when you get tired of the genre pushing the likes of Ricky and Marc, it is nice to see the dark horse ride up to the microphone.As I said, ""Emiliano"" does good."
3,Disc Sander Review,"The sander went together easily and all the parts were included in the package. My sander sits on a sealed concrete floor, and the vibration when running caused it to slide around the floor. I placed the legs on a foam sanding pad and that put a stop to the sliding around. The sander itself works well and seems to have plenty of power. The dust collection works well enough to keep the dust out of my shop, so overall I'm quite pleased."
3,"Works OK, but could be better.","I needed a stationary sander, and Delta's 31-695 was the unit that was in my price range. It went together well, and sands satisfactorily, but just seems to lack something. I didn't want to spend the nearly $800 for the Delta sanding center, but in the long run..., I probably should've held out. The cast aluminum table for the disc sander is flimsy, and does not adjust well to angled sanding. I've already stripped out one of the retention knobs and have noticed a little difficulty with belt tracking. Other than those issues, it's OK, I wouldn't purchase another one though."
4,sanders,This sander is heavy and seems to be well built. The shipping carton was damaged extensively upon arrival but there were no missing parts. Delta needs to use a stronger carton. The internal styrene packing does not properly support the contents. The assembly was simple and easy and the instructions were clear. I have used the sander several times and I am very satisfied with its performance.
1,Bad Description,"Although the word ""blur"" was used once in the the product description, nowhere did it state that this was a collection of completely blurred photographs. Art? Perhaps to some. To me it was just a waste of money."
2,smaller than expected.,"The stands are smaller than I expected, if you have a small plant you may like them; but they did not work for me."
1,Serious Disappointment,"I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. Amazon will not accept the return of a software product that has been opened. I could not test the product without opening it. Adobe Premiere Elements 3.0 would not load on my Emachine with a 2800 AMD Athlon XP processor. I got a error message SSE2 Instructtion set missing. How was I to know about the lack such an instruction set without try to load the product? But both Amazon and Adobe have covered themselves legally and I am in the lurch.I tried to load it on my laptop; it did load, but the laptop was too slow and had insufficient hard drive space for the program to work effectivly. So now I have a program that I can not use until I upgrade the computer, at the cost of $400. Or buy another computer, $700. Both alternatives are poor choices. Thanks for the opportunity to complain."
2,Faulty car,Got this as a gift. Has had problems since day one. Music sometimes sounds as if batteries are low or even doesn't play at all. Often makes a high pitch squealing noise instead of music. But when it does work well my son loves it.
5,Brighton Beach Memoirs,"Brighton Beach Memoirs is a play about a fourteen-year-old boy growing up in 1937. The boy's name is Eugene Jerome. The play is divided into two acts. The first act is one night in Eugene's house. The second act is a week later in his house. Eugene is growing up in a hectic and eventful household of seven family members. He writes memoirs in his journal about his family and different events occurring in his life. During the play, Eugene share's his own personal thoughts with the audience. This really gives the audience an inside look on Eugene's life. I reall liked having this inside view. It really kept me into the book. Brighton Beach Memoirs was a real page turner. I highly recommend it!"
3,other sources for the one good song,"There is at least one other cd where one can find ""Dancing In the Moonlight"" and also get other GOOD songs from the 1970's. I'm not sure which volume number it's on, but DITM is on one of Rhino's ""Have a Nice Day/Super Hits of the 70's"" discs. It's on one of the higher numbered ones, even though it's from earlier in the decade; Rhino apparently came by the licensing rights (or just decided to include the song) later on in the series, as they did a few other early 70's titles which appeared near the end of that 25-disc series."
1,Not a children's story,"I am apalled this book is touted as appropriate for eight-year-old children. It is far too explicit for that age group. Jets screaming overhead dropping bombs, killing his father, the boy dreaming of being hit and dying, his sister hit by a truck her legs broken. The fact he lives in a mud hut and eats only a small portion of bread and water everyday almost seems cheerful in comparison. Then, the boy talks about the significance of each color in the rug he is weaving ""white for the shroud we wrapped my father's body in""...""Red is the color of the blood of martyrs."" Finally, never mind using the story as any sort of a springboard to illustrate giving and helping others less fortunate. The boy states his carpet weaving training is made possible by someone far away ""a sponsor."" And they even took his picture. Then he goes on to say that once he learns the trade he will be able to hold his head high for the sake of his father...who would never have taken aid from a sponsor."
1,Trite as can be and for non-travelers only,"The prose here is trite and superficial, and so are the experiences related by the author. Anyone who's ever traveled will cringe when reading this because Lansky is the kind of tourist that seasoned travelers stay away from--a loud, obnoxious, ignorant frat boy on tour."
3,Lukewarm,"Disappointing. Dull. The only saving grace is that the travel stories are short. Like pulling a tooth, at least it is over quickly."
5,Lansky weaves a tapestry of not-to-be missed adventures.,"Doug Lansky must have been Sheherazade in another life! He weaves a tapestry of not-to be-be missed adventure stories, totally capturing the reader through his unique style. His tales are fascinating and amusing-we want more!"
3,Delta 50-287 tool stand base,The Delta 50-330 univeersal tool stand fits loosely in the base. Neither of the two holes in the base lines up up with the one hole in the stand. I'm not sure the stand and base should be bolted together but it seems drill press mounted to the stand might be top-heavy or unstable. Additional info from Delta would be helpful.
5,The Blues Man,"You can't think about downhome blues without thinking about Bobby Bland. Even though he has a more sophisticated style of singing the blues, his singing will put you in a bluesy mood."
1,How to train a monkey to write.,"With her collection of fill-in-the-blanks exercises, Ramos's book suggests that writing for children is a formulaic activity. No creativity is necessary. This book might be useful for folks who care more about the paycheck than their message. For those of you who feel you actually have something unique to share with children, <u>any</u> other book would be more useful."
5,Must Read,"Must Read:This is a definite ""Must Read"" for all Muslims, not just converts.He writes with sensitivity beyond what one usually finds in a biographical work. I did find,in reading this, many of the passages in the Quran became clearer.I had set out to read only religious material during the month of Ramadan and this was the first book I chose. After reading it, through my local library, I immediately went into Amazon.com and bought the book. I did this with the next book I read also. That is ""In The Footsteps Of The Prophet."" If you want to see what I thought of that one, then check out my review when they send me the request to do so. :)Br. Emerick is a marvelous writer. I am now going to write my review of his ""An Idiots Guide To Islam"" Insha Allah. YUP, bought that too!"
2,Biased and Unscholarly,"This is a book for believers. I found its treatment of Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians unfair and, frankly, uninformed. A quick example: the author casually discards the Persians as idolators, whereas the Sassanids, for all their faults, were noted iconoclasts. This book may be well-written, but it is not well-researched."
1,Don't Buy this CD,"This CD is cheesy - even for preschool-age kids. They deserve better quality music than this offers. Buy a nice Raffi CD or I strongly recommend Hap Palmer for more ""activity-oriented"" music (Try ""Rhythms on Parade"")I teach music to Preschool and Pre-K students and this CD is not very fun for them - the music is of poor quality and the activities with the bean bags seem a little forced. Don't waste your money, there are much better CDs out there for kids."
5,"only like half of this CD, but that half makes the whole CD worth 5 stars !","The first 7 tracks are superb, except for the ridiculous lyrics of Smooth Operator (the posturing is laughable, c'mon guys). I found the remaining tracks boring and trivial, except for 13 (Got Plex) which is GREAT. So out of 17 tracks, I listen to 8. And I STILL give this CD 5 stars, because the 8 are so powerful and wonderful and creative, they so outweigh the crappy other tracks. If you are a fan of rap, BUY THIS CD, listen to it several times, let it settle in, do some 'net searches if you don't know the regional lingo, and enjoy !"
4,some amazing songs...,"i have to admit alot of these songs on this album (to me) arent very good.. i liked them at first but later they got old.... but there are a few really great songs such as Girl, Just Paul Wall, Sippin Tha Barre, & Drive Slow. all of those songs are great. lyrics are real, tell a story, and are relavent to the things last said. the beats are awesome and never get old, and the way paul just flows on these tracks are just chill, he spits the lyrics smoothly and makes it sound good.. there are a few more good songs on the album but those are my favorite... anyways i think for around 5 bucks this is a great buy. not to mention u get 2 CD's"
1,Chopped and Screwed is correct.,I bought this cd not knowing there was a difference in the Peoples Champ albums. This version is terrible. This dj slowed down all of the lyrics to where they do not sound like the artists. I would not reccommend this cd to anyone who has any taste in music.
3,Sorry Beats,This cd is not as good as everyone in Houston thought it would be. He really got screwed on his beats. The people that produced the beats for still tipping and sittin sideways should have done the beats for his whole cd. But it's nice that he added a little love song 'girl' and of course everyone here in Houston loves that 'internet goin nutz' I do think if the beats would have been better his cd could have been better. I guess we will have to see what Chamillionare comes out with. Like I alwayz have said from the beginning him and Paul together are just natural. Maybe they can work together in the near future to make something good.
2,NO!,"This CD is okay. Its not painfully bad, but it is no where near Great. Paul Wall to me is a knock off of Mike Jones. However I like Mike Jones because he has a groove. Paul Wall - NO! If you want this CD, save your money and burn a copy. It is not really worth the money they sell it for."
3,He ok 4 a whiteboy,"This cd is alright, the only time i jam it is when im drivin down the street, sippin some drank and smokin a sweet. He has the same flo, it gets annoyin, he has talent, but needs to improve on writin his lyrics. Download it, dont waste your money."
1,played out rhymes,"paul walls cd to me wasnt good at all, he has nothing to rap about besides his grill and his candy paint, maybe he should have spent more money on the production of this cd instead of his mouthcop ""the sound of revenge"" by chamillionaire, cham always brings the heat on the mic"
1,Booo!,"This album stinks! Featured artists include people he has gave discounts on grills to. Pow Wow is ""The Little Engine that Could"" or if you prefer ""The People's Chump!"" Buy Bubba Sparxxx. Avoid this album at all costs. East TX blew up these artists not Houston. It's sad that Swishahouse got to rep TX. As far as TX albums, get Chamillionaire, Z-Ro, Scarface, Bun B and/or Devin. In other words, stay away from anything Swishahouse."
5,A must for all Judd fans,"Love can build a bridge tells the real-life story of Naomi and Wynonna Judd's rise to fame. It also chronicles the devastating way Naomi was forced to leave it. The movie depicts the tumultuous relationship between mother and daughter, and the strong bond between them. It is based on the book of the same name written by Naomi Judd. It is definetly a must for any Judd fan."
2,thigh high leg avenue tights,"It says these ""one size fits all"" tights should fit someone weighing 90-160lbs, I weigh about 130 (give or take a few pounds) and am about 5 feet. My thighs buldge out the top of these tights(not cute). I do have thick thighs so might work if you have skinny thighs (like the girl in the picture). Also if you are short they will be way too long. They are cute and cheap but its too bad they only come in one size."
3,keep your manual.,"THIS CAR SEAT HAS WORKED GOOD FOR ME THE PAST 4 YEARS OF USE. I HAD A MINI VAN SO THE SIZE WAS NEVER A PROBLEM. BUT NOW THAT MY SON IS READY FOR THE BOOSTER SEAT SETTING, WELL I CANT FIND THE MANUAL. THATS RIGHT I DIDNT KEEP MY MANUAL IN A SAFE DEPOSIT BOX OR IN A SEALED VOLT SO I COULD USE THE THIRD SETTING. WHO WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THIS SEAT WAS SO DIFICULT TO FIGURE OUT. SO I AM ASKING FOR A HUGE FAVOR.. IF YOU STILL HAVE THIS MANUAL WILL YOU E-MAIL ME A COPY OF THE BOOSTER SEAT INSTRUCTION PLEASE. ( PHOTOBRAT2003@YAHOO.COM ) THANK YOU SO MUCH."
4,A nice car seat-just vague installation directions,"This is a really nice car seat and my 8 month old seems to really like it. The installations were a little vague however. We use the latch system and the way the directions said how to install it, there was no way to get the seat tightly installed. I finally figured out on my own to thread the system through the seat, under the padding, which was not easy to do, but it was the only way to get the system tightenend. Other than that, it is a nice seat!"
4,Go Missy Go!,I have never been a fan of rap but Missy has changed me. Great tunes in this album. An album definitely a must get.
2,Not really good at all! And not so explicit.,"When I buy something, specially where it is marked Explicit Lyrics, I'd hope that nothing is blanked out. But trust me a few words are.I was expecting a great album from Missy E,. But this album is """". To much R-N-B, and I hate R-N-B. Missy has a great singing voice though. And the beats aren't that ""Addictive"" as she claims."
5,Get Ur Freaky Ears On,"No body, no looks, but she's the hottest rapper-songwriter-producer today. Missy Elliott has her hands on many albums and she's got the midas touch. Whatever she touches turn to gold...and on her solo outin, she invites a host of frenz (look at the list of who's who in her thank you notes) to guest on her third album.Nonetheless, her thunder is never stolen. The guest artists serve to brighten her star. On the terribly funki Get Ur Freak On, the beats are irresistable. A pity that the Amended Remix featuring Nelly Furtado was left out here. Other notable tracks are one Minute Man, Lick Shots and the retro Old School Joint which sounds possibly like what Daft Punk may sample on their new album.With two top 10 hits including the #1 Lady Marmalade off the Moulin Rogue soundtrack on the charts, Missy Elliott's emergence has totally changed the rap landscape.A 5***** follow-up to the equally superior Da Real World!!!"
5,the artwork of missy,"Missy Elliot is one of the hottest and talented artists in the music business. However, i don't feel she gets proper notarity. Everything she touches "" turns to gold."" Hopefully, in the future, missy will get the awards, press and attention that, i feel she is not getting now. All of her cds are well worth buying.Robbie Adamo."
3,Go with McAfee if you have a Compaq PC,"From the moment I installed this my computer simply went downhill, eventually resulting in consistent crashes and a probably unrelated motherboard failure.However, I have many friends with this program that have great experiences with it.Bottom Line: It's a good product...if it doesn't slaughter your system first."
1,Stay with 2002,"I upgraded rather than just paying for the virus protection subscription for NAV 2002, because it was cheaper after rebates. That was a BIG mistake. Since then my cpu is pegged at 100% and my system is unstable. When I remove Norton's products the pc runs fine. Re-install it and it's back to not being stable. I'm searching for a new vendor as Norton is not it anymore. Symantec has yet to respond to any of my support questions and I refuse to pay by the minute when their software has obvious problems."
1,norton internet security- 2003,"This is one of the worst designed pieces of junk I ever purchased.I installed this on my computer and it promptly froze access to most of my programs. It failed to recognize my status as a supervisor even when it recognized me as a supervisor. You can't even uninstall this mess because it requires supervisor status to do so. Symantec tech assistant e-mailed me that they knew they had a problemand suggested uninstalling it, which you can't do as it won't let you. I took it off my computer and returned it for credit. Norton {symantec} has zero creditibility with me."
1,Don't Buy This Product,"I made the mistake of purchasing this product, which appears to have been prematurely released for sale to the public. I am running Windows 98, with Outlook Express as my e-mail program. Outlook Express has been around for a long time, and predates the release of Norton Antivirus 2003. After I installed Norton Antivirus 2003, I couldn't access my e-mail account. After trying, without success, to reconfigure Outlook Express with the help of a senior Tech Advisor with my Internet Service Provider, we finally UNINSTALLED Norton Antivirus 2003. This solved the problem immediately. I then purchased and installed McAfee VirusScan 7.0, which worked perfectly. I believe that McAfee is the better product. Simply stated, it works."
2,Cheap versions are not full versions,"I have bought inexpensive versions of Norton system utilities and Norton anti-virus. Both were limited versions, either a beta release or a 90-day version."
4,Good protection!,"The Norton Antivirus is good virus protection software. I previously had Norton Antivirus 2002, and 2003 is a great improvement over it. The 2003 version automatically scans for updates, whereas the 2002 popped up to let you know updates were available, but you had to do several things to prompt it to check for updates. This can be set to do a total scan for viruses automatically once a week. This is an easy, convenient choice for antivirus protection on your computer."
5,Francis J George Sr,"Again the best. Does what it says and does it right. Not a lot of bells and whistles, but I am not paying for pretty, I'm paying for results. It doesn't get in the way. I forget it's running, but it reminds me when it grabs a virus, etc. Been using it since the early years. That's it plain and simple."
3,A good historical perspective (I think),"A good review of people involved in the story before, during and after Einstein's famous equation, with a little physics thrown in. The problem is that the section about Chandrasekar makes it sound like he was the first to conceptualize black holes, which he certainly wasn't -- Newton considered the possibility and Einstein was initially surprised and doubtful when it was pointed out to him by Schwarzschild that his field equations led to the inevitable conclusion of black holes. What Chandrasekar did on his voyage to England, which was no small feat was to prove mathematically the largest white dwarf that could resist becoming a black hole (the 'Chandrasekar limit' which is about 1.4 solar masses). This error in the book sort of poisons the well and makes me wonder what other historical 'facts' were not quite."
4,enjoyable read,Bodanis personalizes the famous equation so that even i could understand its significance. Bodanis tells personal stories of famous characters associated with the equation including WWII secret missions and anti-semitism. Bodanis does a good job making the equation understandable. This book has made me look up at the sun with whole new understanding.
3,Liked the movie... loved the theme song!!!,Wierd... kind of surreal movie... a 3 in the morning vibe. A little dorky in spots. Very funky jazzy disco song for the theme... I dug it.
1,I may be in trouble,"I'm probably in trouble with a family of good friends who let me spend New Year's Eve with them because of this movie. He came all the way from the other side of their considerable domicile to ask me to hold it down, I was laughing too loudly. Low budget? Yes. Predictable? Iffy. Hilarious? Oh, yes. I managed to hold it down but I think I pulled a muscle, my ribs hurt in the morning. Maybe you have to be a Shatner fan or know some of his history, but he got some good licks in and the situation was priceless!"
4,Fun,"Tattoos are really nice, but the ink part (markers) wash off easily. The black tattoo outline seems to last several days."
3,Disappointed...,"When I ordered this machine I felt that because it had the delta name that it would be well made but now after using it I am disappointed in it. First the dust collection system built into the machine does not work at all. The dust bag that comes with the machine is useless. You have to attach a shop vac to it or you will be covered in dust. Second there is no arbor lock on the machine to help screwing the spindle on and off. Last of all, the motor seems weak to me. A stronger motor would be much better. It is poorly designed and not up to the quality I expect in a tool made by Delta."
1,EWW- this video is unappealing on so many levels.,"This is a B-rate, 15 minute film that looks like it was shot in the 80's. It's largely uninformative, unsexy, and the two ""instructors"" resemble a father/daughter pair, which makes the whole scene even weirder. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU DO NOT PURCHASE THIS VIDEO."
1,What a rip-off,The actual content of DVD is about 19 minutes long and the good part looks like some kind of Powerpoint presentation with almost no pictures. The actual demonstration of clit massage is less than 5 minutes long. And the woman in the demonstration is almost silent. The demonstrator tells how the woman is aroused but the viewers have no way of knowing. I'd rather recommend Loving Sex video series.
5,serenade her with these hits,"Here are some easy piano arrangements for popular love songs, including 'A Moment Like This,' 'Breathe,' 'I Do (Cherish You),' and 'Don't Know Why.' Just because it's easy notation doesn't mean it sounds simple. And these pieces are easy to add your own flair to."
3,Great for a one-night stand...,"I am one of those ""weird"" people who likes a little plot and character with my erotica. Most of the stories in this collection seemed to lack real plot, and for that, I was disappointed. The stories succeeded in turning me on, but many failed to make me care. While an occasional ""we met, we got turned on, we got it on"" story is fun, I prefer commitment to my reading -- like in real life, I guess. Maybe that's why I thought Herotica 6 was better. I'd recommend 6 over 5."
1,You dont really get your Bang for your Buck,"I have to say that I was really dissapointed in this book. I know it says there are 23 stories, so I should haev been better prepared for short stories...only some of them were only like 5 pages long, and on top of that, they were just plain stupid. I think this was a waste and I know I will not buy any moer books that have large groupings of stories in them. Hey, I like a good hot juicy sex scene as much as the next person, but i think i would prefer a little more depth of the story than what you get with this group of stories. Some of the stories in here would have you going ""huh?"" after you read it. What else can you say..."
1,"For suburban fools, by suburban fools","The newest installment in this increasingly redundant (as if it hadn't been redundant to begin with) series of ""erotic"" stories has about as much heat as an unplugged electric blanket. It's more propaganda in the service of sex as a perpetually Good Thing, with nary a mention of damage, pain, removal, coldness, or anything sex-related that gets less commonly propagandized because it's just no fun. People who mistake books like this for any kind of deep truths about human sexuality -- which is what the ultimate aim of this kind of medicinal-pleasure nonsense is all about, anyway -- are the butt of a joke that they probably aren't even aware of."
4,Good basic educational read,"I'm an LEO and a SAR coordinator. When I started getting tasked in assisting with management and manpower on forensic searches, I purchased this book. It's been very useful not for the search theory but for the basic, ""executive summary"" type technology review (ground penetrating radar, infrared aerial photography, various seismic type systems)as well as a basic overall methodology. I use the section on recognizing graves for instructing volunteers. I don't know if evidence folks and the homicide dets are exposed to this technology, but if you are tasked with trying to find a remote grave site, this is a great first book."
5,Great POSSESSIONS,David Kline's writings are beautiful. His knowledge of nature is gleaned from working intimately with nature and appreciating it as a gift of God.a
5,sniff this one out!,"The inspiring story of a female police officer who hit on the idea of having bloodhounds search for lost pets. It's incredible no one has hit on such a wonderful idea before. Her Weimaraner, Rachel, took to the training right away (""Find a cat and earn cheese? It was a doggy dream come true!""), but it was disheartening to see how many people, friends included, who laughed or dismissed her pursuit as unworthy of good search dogs. Still, her perserverence paid off, and there are some heartwarming stories of successful rescues (as well as the inevitably sad outcomes of less fortunate pets). The book also contains some good advice on choosing a pet, along with some very helpful tips on what to do if your dog or cat has run away, not to mention a listing of online resources. Highly recommended, and a good companion piece with Melinda Roth's THE MAN WHO TALKS TO DOGS."
3,Don't Try To Unistall Norton 2003 Professional,"I purchased SYMANTEC's Norton AntiVirus 2003 Professional from a local software suplier. After the installation an error occured in a file. The uninstaller was advised and used but alas it left a file some where in the system. I reloaded the antivirus again and again, but, to no avail. On return to the store of purchase the saleswoman explained to me that it is a bad batch of CD's and they are not getting anymore and refunded my money. This hasn't solved the problem of an error on start up. I would apprecate if any one could assist on sending an email to sgtacc2001 @ hotmail.comCheersFalcon"
4,Lots of pockets but poor zipers.,"I pretty much love this pack, which I've owned for over a year. I just have two caveats. The first and the biggest one is that both zippers have crapped out. For some reason the zippers catch on the fabric that attaches them to the bag and wear a hole into the fabric making in a hassle to zip the pack because they catch every time. The second issue is that when loaded with a laptop there's only room for about 2 or 3 notebooks or two textbooks tops. For the most part I'm pretty happy with it and when I've tried using other packs I end up coming back to this one."
3,Good resource!,"This is a very helpful resource in the field, but I didn't find it to be as beneficial as another source. Students who bought this dictionary complained of the high cost for low gain.The content itself is excellent, though I couldn't always find the terms I sought. The bilingual explanations are helpful.Buy this book at the used price and the other one and you will have most of the words you need."
5,VanChair,"I was nervous after I read that it would take a long time for the book to come. I think it said somewhere that it could come in like up to 16 days, or something like that. Well, I had already just added the class so I didn't want to wait. In just three days I decided to write them to tell them to cancel, because they didn't put that my book had shipped, so I thought that it wasn't even shipped. I waited one more day, due to being busy and then the book had came that morning. It was pretty fast for it being sent from oversea's. It was shipped from England to Los Angeles. I am happy that I recieved the book so fast. It was in perfect condition too."
5,Best children CD found,My entire family loves this CD. My 3 & 16 month old girls dance and dance until the very last song!!
2,Difficult to read,"I bought this book because it got great reviews here on Amazon. Well to be honest, I couldn't even finish the book (I got about half way). First it was very difficult to read, the author gives so many statisitcs that your head is swimming with numbers, if your like me, a new mom with very little time to read w/ a demanding baby, your probably looking for some straight forward info on the best (fastest and least painful) way to get your baby to sleep. Second the testimolials he gives advocates cry out methods, which if your child is like mine, would not work. The whole reason I bought this book was because I strongly do not believe in the cry out method (my son would make himself sick before he would fall asleep). On the positive, there is some interesting information in this book about ADD being linked to sleep deprivation, and the release of a stimulating hormone when we are over tired and how it prevents us from falling asleep.(...)"
2,Ugh,"Ugh - this is my comment on this book. Firstly, as others have already noted, this guy should have hired a good editor. There are inconsistencies all over the place with regard to his recommendations. More importantly, though, the author advocates letting a 4-month-old cry it out alone, with no checks or consolations or visits, for the entire night. That's right: according to this guy, it's OK to put your baby down in the crib, shut the door, and do not return until morning. Help! Who does this?!?!??!? Don't bother buying this book unless you are a sociopath."
2,Disasterous failure for me ...,"I never thought I would let my daughter cry, but I had known so many people who this worked for and after months of sleep deprivation I was ready to try it. To my horror, I did it for 3 weeks and instead of getting better, things just got worse. By the time I gave up my 9 month old daughter had developed an intense fear of her crib. When I would walk towards the crib to set her down, a look of terror would pass over her face and the hysterical screaming would go on off and on all night long. I know it works for a lot of parents but it just didn't work for us at all. My daughter was too strong-willed for this.I had much better success with Good Night, Sleep Tight by Kim West. A much better method for us. Also, we had been cosleeping prior to trying this and I think all this method did was intensify her separation anxiety. If you are transitioning from cosleeping but are still okay with some tears I would strongly recommend the Kim West book instead."
1,this book is child abuse,"This book is one of the scariest thing i have ever read. A true book of horror.This book misses the whole idea that children are children and should not be expected to act like adults act. I know adults that dont sleep through the night and forcing a child to sleep through the night is awful. Let the children vomit? Ignore them and clean them up after they are asleep?We cannot treat prisoners of war this way, but somehow it is ok to treat our children this way? I dont see how any parent can use this and be able to sleep at night... even if it makes their child sleep (which it probably wont). The last thing we need to teach our children is to not trust their parents and that their cries will go unheard because of their parent's selfishness."
4,Good advice so far,"The book came in very good condition. I just started reading it so I have not finished, but so far it has some great advice."
1,I Hate This Book,"Extremely inhumane. It's weird what people will do to their kids and themselves just to get some sleep. I know how hard it is, I've been there too. My suggestion to everyone is not to trust everything that doctors say, I think Americans have an ""expert addiction"". Which is just to say that we tend to ignore what our hearts tell us in favor of some scientific method that some doctor guarantees will work unless of course we don't do it the right way. Think about that for a minute. Your instinct is to soothe your child(ren), do it. Stop listening to the ""experts"". I truly can't stand this guy and I hope I never meet him."
4,A Great Help!,This book worked like a charm. I dont know if it was that my 6 mo old is just a good sleeper or this is the answer to all sleep issues. As soon as I put the book's suggestions in to action she started sleeping through the night. It really worked for us.
5,Nighty night!,"This book helped me and my whole family get a good night sleep. I had no clue about sleep until I read this book. Weissbluth taught me what I needed to know to ""sleep train"" my kids. Now they are both good sleepers."
1,Not pratical!,"The book was awful and way too lengthy to read for sleep deprived parents. I read the reviews and bought it anyways and regret the whole 4 dollars I spent lol. It was too jumpy, didnt make sense and totally contradicting!The ONLY helpful tip I picked up was to look for baby's sleepy cues...such as yawning, fussing, tired eyes..etc, and to be honest I might have read that on an previous review.If your looking for a straight to the point HELPFUL book, then buy Everything You Need To Know For The Modern Day Parent an A-Z guide by Mark Cohen...great book, and VERY straigh to the point. My son is now 12 weeks and sleeping through the nights:)"
3,Sound advice but heavy reading,"As a first time mom, I found the advice to align with my natural instincts. At the same time, much of the content is dedicated to the research behind the approach making the book difficult to wade through. While this lends credibility, it's not easy to process the steps recommended by the author. This is a learn by doing method but the book doesn't make the recommendations for ""doing"" easy on parents--especially if you're living off interrupted sleep.Maybe you're supposed to read this once before the baby arrives and then use as a reference after baby is actually a part of your life. (Not necessarily easy with limited time.) There must be a way to organize the book and parse out the research (maybe have a section in back you can go to with the details) from the advice."
2,frustrating writing style detracts from any potential points,"Dr. Wiessbluth may have had some good points in his text, but the editors should be fired for not helping draw these points out. As a sleep deprived mother I found this book very frustrating to read...I made it through about half the book before finding the style so infuriating I quit and decided to ""wing-it"" on my baby's sleep program instead."
2,"Good Ideas, but a bit harsh.","I got some good ideas and information from this book, but a lot of the ""let them cry for an hour"" seemed harsh. My 10 month old son didn't make it to 20 minutes before he would get so worked up he would projectile vomit across the room and choke on it. I found the No Cry Sleep Solutions to fit us much better, especially since we have co slept his whole life so far."
2,"Okay, if you're looking for support to CIO","Pros:-Sleep is very important, and the author makes that clear. He gives you a good idea for how much sleep a baby needs. We have started putting our daughter down for a nap 1-2 hours after waking in the morning which makes a big difference. We would never have thought of that if not for this book.-The author suggests keeping a sleep log, which is also very helpful. We haven't done it exactly as he said (make a bar graph, yeah like I really have time for that!) but just writing it down has helped us to see patterns in her sleep. We have a small spiral notebook where we write things like ""Wake: 7am. Nap at 8:30""Cons:-This is a Cry it Out book. His advice for when CIO doesn't work (because the kid vomits) is 'don't let them cry so much'.If you're looking for validation on your decision to CIO, I recommend it, but if you can't do that (like us) then try something else."
2,Impractical,"I liked the information about sleep in this book but it was hard to read, very boring. Otherwise he recommends putting your baby to sleep from 6-8 in the evening because that's how the babies circadian clock supposedly works, but that just doesn't work for us and I felt judged for not wanting to put my kids down to bed at sunset. For some people this might work but for most modern parents unless you want to be tied to the house while you have small children I wouldn't recommend his methods."
3,Good ideas in theory!,"This book was recommended to me by my cousin and while the patterns and ideas in it worked for her, they did not work me. Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child is laid out well with specific chapters for each stage of your child's life and it has personal stories in so new parents can relate to someone else. However, this is designed for the stay at home mom and will not work for everyone. Due to this one sided way the book is written, it did not work for us so I not would recommend it to anyone who is a working parent."
1,"500 Pages, 10pt Font of Confusing Drivel on a Basic Concept","I'm a ""bottom-line""-it kind of person. Don't buy this book. I totally agree with the many reviewers who say this book is poorly written and structured. It's worse than most confusing text books. It is not laid out in a an intuitive way and has weird little text boxes with ""tips"" throughout which are labelled in different ways so you can't even really scan it successfully.It's kind of a joke to be sleep deprived and then to think the answer lies within this rubix-cube of a book. One reviewer says to 'save your time and ask a doctor'; YES to that times a hundred. Seems like it's 500 pages of 10pt font of random back and forth thoughts on sleep."
1,"This book needs an Editor, Badly!","This book probably has good advise, but its burried in so much unimportant information that I got so frustrated and gave up on it. It was like the book was never properly edited and was compiled by a college student pulling an all-nighter to get it done on time. From what I could get out of it was let your baby cry it out - Is that news to anyone and is it worth dedicating an entire book to deliver that message?"
3,Good info but not my style!,"I think that this book was useful in the fact that I learned a lot about the scientific importance of sleep. The concept of sleep scheduling and theory was also insightful. However, the methodology that the doctor prescribes is simply not the right medicine for the parent who cannot tolerate their sweet baby crying endlessly. I think a better book to try would be ""The No Cry Sleep Solution,"" it was much better suited to a gentler style of parenting."
4,"Good background, wish I read it sooner",This book is very informative about the amount of sleep most children need and what the possible effects can be of too little sleep both short and long term. It offers good advise on setting routines and rules for insuring sleep and reassurance to know that it won't be easy at first but will be helpful to both parents and baby in the end. I wish the book offered more insight into breaking bad habits but at least it gives insight into setting the right ones.
3,SLOW start,"This book is incredibly slow starting out. I did not read this book while I was pregnant and don't have time or interest in statistics and sleep studies of hypothetical infants. I got this book as my baby turned 3 1/2 months and is beginning to want out of her swaddle. I thought it would provide easy (or at least present straightforward tips) on how to create ""healthy sleep habits"" but so far that's not the case. It also makes a LOT of assumptions about breastfeeding, which I find to be insensitive."
2,A little disappointed,"I was a little disappointed in the book. It often seemed disorganized, vague or at times talked rather lofty. There were a few good nuggets of info, such as 'never wake a sleeping baby' and knowing how many hours of sleep a baby should be getting and at what intervals. However, I was looking for more step by step - do this to get your child to sleep, but it seemed more like anything goes - no real strategies for dealing with my child. And there were lots and lots of horror stories from parents about their children crying for hours on end, and now I'm quite petrified to deliver mine..."
5,worked for us!,"Dr. Weissbluth is not just a sleep expert to us, but also our pediatrician. His sleep method has helped my son Jonah very much. As a new mother, it really helped me understand how to organize Jonah's daytime and nightime sleep schedule and how important it is for him to have his sleep times match his natural circadian rhythms. I sleep trained Jonah according to the gradual extinction ""let cry"" method and even though it was excruciating, within four days Jonah was sleeping through the night. He (and we) are all better rested for it!"
5,Baby has been sleeping through the night since 7 weeks,"Wonderful book. Borrowed it from a friend when my baby was only sleeping 2-3 hrs at a time during the night. Decided to follow the book one night and he has been sleeping during the night ever since. He usually sleeps 10 - 11 hrs at night and goes to bed around 7 pm. The book is also correct that the better a child sleeps at night, the better they will sleep during the day. I would highly recommend this book."
2,Might be good if you read before delivery....,"I read this book when my daughter was eight months old. I did NOT find it very helpful. He contradicts himself often and cites numerous research studies and goes on and on and on for nearly 500 pages. Now, what parent, who is having a difficult time with their baby sleeping, has the time to read this book?!I am a follower of the Baby Whisperer method (Tracy Hogg) and his philosophy is opposite hers. He prefers the crying it out method. He says it's fine to let the baby cry for an hour.He also writes a lot about ""colicky"" babies and this was something I didn't have a problem with and therefore a large section of the book was not important to me.If you read this book before delivery it might be helpful. I did not find it helpful as I'd already discovered many of his insights on timing the naps/bedtime, routine consistency, etc by the time my little one was eight months old.Good Luck"
5,Sleep-deprieved parents: Do yourself a favor & read this!,"The most interesting thing about this book is that the advice Weisbluth offers flys directly in the face of conventional wisdom about children and sleeping. Specifically, Weisbluth debunks the myth that by keeping kids up later, they are more tired and therefore sleep better (and or later). The bottom line according to Weisbluth -- a well-rested child sleeps more and sleeps better. Who'd a thunk it? You have to read the compelling research he presents and then take it on faith (although its hard to believe) and try what he tells you. It is amazing how well his techniques work!!! No traumatic Ferberizing, minimal (if any) crying. Just good ol' fashion sleeping -- for you and your little one. Sweet dreams!"
1,Terrible,"This person has some interesting ideas, and I'm sure he's a good doctor, but he has no business writing a book! He uses terrible grammar, repeats himself several times, and goes off on tangents that have nothing to do with the paragraphs around them. This book lacks organization, and is very difficult to read."
1,"Contradictory, Disorganized, and No Help at All for Colicky Babies!","I'm a medical student and new mom and bought this book because my son is colicky. I'm an information junky and usually take a lot away from any book or article I read. Not so with this book! It is one of the most poorly organized books I've ever read, the information is contradictory, the studies he sites are worthless (small sample sizes, no true cause/effect relationships--he says too little sleep causes bad temperments, but can't a bad temperment be the cause for less sleep?!), and he provides no solid method to apply! Basically all the book does is confuse the reader and make her feel worse because not only does she have a child who is sleeping poorly, she also just wasted time and money reading a worthless book. Don't buy it or read it. Just look for signs of sleepiness in your child and do whatever you can to get them to sleep and stay asleep for as long as possible."
3,Poorly edited,"While I think that the ideas in this book are sound and very well researched, I gave it 2 stars because it is a nightmare to read, especially for a sleep deprived parent searching for answers to help her baby sleep. The book is poorly organized and edited which makes it difficult to understand the basic principals that the author is trying to convey."
3,There's good advice in here -- somewhere,"This book has a ton of great info, but is HORRIBLY written. Dr. Weissbluth clearly knows his stuff, but if he were really interested in helping sleep-deprived parents, he would hire a good writer to clean up this mess."
2,"Good ideas, poorly organized","The book's argument is that babies and children need adequate sleep, and that much like hunger, it's counter-productive to ""starve"" a child of sleep. So far, so good. What I found lacking was the step-by-step strategy on the cover. The basic idea seems to be to attune oneself to the child's cues, and rush them to bed before they become overtired, but I had to wade through hundreds of pages before getting to that insight. And there's little guidance for parents who aren't comfortable with the ""cry it out"" method."
5,An Eye Opener!,"So simple and logical but we were missing it. We thought our daughter was sleeping too much because we could get her to sleep at night. I didn't realize that children needed so much sleep. We were completely missing her ""window"" because it was so much earlier than I could have ever imagined. This was an excellent book and I have given it to many new parents as a gift."
5,THIS BOOK IS THE BEST!!!,"I received this item as a gift at my baby shower. Since then, I swore I was going to buy a copy for every new mother I know! Gives sleep averages and patterns by age group from newborn to toddlers. After reading this book, my daughter slept through the night since 4 months old. She is now almost nine months and still sleeps through the night with two regular naps a day. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
1,methods are too harsh for me,"I read this book, and found that what Weissbluth recommends is letting a child ""cry it out"" - for three or four hours at a time, if need be - starting at ages as low as two months. This approach may be necessary for some families, but I personally couldn't do it. I can handle only a few minutes of crying, and only after the baby reaches the age of six months or so, myself. I found Richard Ferber's book, Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems, to be vastly kinder and more humane, besides explaining things much more clearly and providing many more alternatives. If you have a problem with the idea of leaving a child to cry for more than a few minutes, I would strongly advise that you try Ferber's book first, and progress to Weissbluth's only if Ferber's methods do not work for your family."
2,Didn't help at all,This book didn't address babies that wake up during the night several times because they haven't learned to fall back asleep at all. No help from this book. Eventually figured out its just something they grow out of on their own.
2,Didn't work for me.,I'm not a proponent of letting a baby cry it out. It physically hurts me to hear my baby cry uncontrollably and gets him so worked up that it takes at least an hour to calm him down after letting him cry for 15 minutes. He is 5 months old and has had severe colic so I feed him to sleep every night. I would not recommend this book for anyone who has a colicky baby. Their advice is to just let them cry it out at so young of an age I'm afraid it would damage their sense of security.
3,Too Complicated,"When your newborn doesn't sleep who's got time to work this hard? The good piece of info is that a daily schedule does help. The reality is that the only way to get a baby to sleep well in a crib is by letting him cry, not too much, but cry. And good luck not letting a newborn fall asleep at the breast. They all fall asleep at the breast! Some parts of the book are helpful but overall the writing isn't clear and concise enough and the plan was too unrealistic for me."
1,Abuse packaged in a book,"Of course babies that are ignored will eventually stop screaming, you are telling them that they aren't important and you are not responsible for them when it is dark. Dogs get better treatment that Weissbluth gives children."
5,Dr. Weissbluth knows exactly what he is talking about!,"It is uncanny, and exceptionally wonderful, to see the superb results of Dr. Weissbluth's advice with our 5 month old. After meeting with Dr. Weissbluth and following his consultation to the letter, we have a very happy baby, and we are likewise happy parents, because a schedule for sleep benefits both the caregiver and the child. I highly recommend this book and the Weissbluth method for any parent who is just starting the sleeping ""game"" or for any parent who is looking to adjust to a very healthy regimine for a child. Three couples that we are close with have all used the Weissbluth methods with their children, and the results are invariably positive. In fact, we believe that healthy sleep is as important as good nutrition for our babies. Three naps for our infant and three cheers for Dr. Weissbluth! If you are considering this approach, don't hesitate - dive in to the book and put your heart into helping your child sleep."
3,helpful,"This book is a little hard to read, but the information is definately helpful and encouraging knowing that your little one will eventually sleep better. Not so able to follow the advice of putting my baby to bed at 6:30 tho."
2,hm...,"the book is all over the place, extremely repetitive and useless.at no point did I feel like he is giving clear guidelines of where your child should be and what to expect next.the only thing I got from it was a better understanding of what sleep is.from this book I went onto ""the no cry sleep solution"" and it helped us much much more. without a tear being shed."
2,Nicole,This is a difficult book to follow - not what I was hoping for. The autho tends to contradict himself a lot.
3,"good EXCEPT for the ""cry it out"" part","This book has good information EXCEPT for the suggestion that you sometimes have to let your baby cry until he or she gives up and goes to sleep. There are gentler alternatives, and the kind of rest a baby gets after sobbing alone until exhausted just can't be the healthiest. Buy Elizabeth Pantley's ""The No-Cry Sleep Solution"" in addition to, or instead of, this book. It explains how you can teach your child the same healthy sleep habits without leaving him or her to cry."
3,Good ideas... hard to follow,"As far as amazon getting the book to me and making things right when I received the old edition, rather than the newest edition.... that is 5 stars. The book itself really wasn't all that easy to read. The ideas were good, but I ended up having to outline the important information and write out a cheat sheet of sorts. Would have been nice if there was a chart included that shows the stages and what you can expect and what you should be doing. DON'T download the app for your iPhone because it doesn't tell you much more. The ideas are good, and I plan to implement them.... however, getting through the book was like reading a college textbook :/"
5,Desperate for sleep!,"After 12 months of very little undisturbed sleep, we realized that we had to make a change. Our son was sleeping 8 hours per night (waking 2-3 times) and taking two 1-hour naps. He could not fall asleep unassisted, wanted to nurse to sleep, and was often irritable during the day. We just thought he was a ""bad sleeper"" when in actuality, we hadn't taught him to sleep. Dr. Weissbluth's fact-based approach showed us that crying it out would help him become self-sufficient. Our son has effectively learned self-soothing techniques and now sleeps 13 hours per night with no night wakings, and takes one two-hour nap per day. An added bonus is that my husband and I have every night from 6:30pm alone to spend quality time with one another. This book is the single-best thing that you can do for your child and your marriage! We now give a copy to all our friends that are new parents."
2,"Good info, just hard to find","This book contains several helpful suggestions, but be prepared to flip around quite a bit to find them. If you're looking for help for a 0-6 month old in particular, the information you need is not well organized. In addition, the examples provided by the author tend to describe extreme sleep issues, not the middle ground."
3,Hard to Follow,"I eagerly began this book, but quickly found myself struggling to get through it.To me, it isn't organized very well, and it reads awkwardly, with a ""tone"" that I thought was a bit preachy. I found the citing of statistics to be tiresome and overused. There were chapters full of statistics, personal histories, etc. on the ""postcolic"" child, but not so much on babies who didn't have colic, they just weren't sleeping well. I kept saying to myself, ""Where is the SOLUTION part of this?"" I realize that finding out why children don't sleep well is important, but what about correcting things? The book was much too vague on what parents could do to make better sleep happen, in my opinion.It has potential, and I got some good information from it, but I would love for it to be easier to read, more concise, and better organized."
2,From a novice beader,"I found this book a little skimpy for the price. As a novice, I found a lot of information that was useful but still didn't feel ready to start a project. The glossary of ""standard terminology"" was exactly 11 items, including the information that a bracelet is 7"" long and goes on your wrist. In a book only 44 pages long, I think there is more important information to include.I think you'd be better of surfing the web for instructions.That said, there were some nice illustrations of the standard tools and clasps, etc. Overall, this book was useful but in no way complete."
3,Bought for a First Attempt at Beading,"As a novice, I found the knotting portion of the book clear enough, but there wasn't enough information on attaching clasps - I had to purchase a book by another author."
3,Won't work for us.,"Ours are hunting dogs and between daily exercise and regular field work, we figured the engraving would be illegible within a month or two. Amazon customer svc connected me with the seller who said they would replace them if they didn't hold up. Said they are guaranteed forever!"
2,Norton GoBack = Good / Rest of Package = Trouble,"I installed this software suite on my home PC about two weeks ago. The problems started almost immediately. I should have read some of these reviews more closely before purchasing.#1: Get ready for your system to slow WAY down, especially when you boot up. There were numerous complaints about this from purchasers of Norton AntiVirus, so I'm assuming this is the particular piece of the package that causes the problems.#2: I upgraded to DSL about a week after installing SystemWorks, and the trouble really hit the fan then. DSL safety also required that I install a firewall, and Norton seems to have no idea how to handle this very well.I'm not a techie, and my advice would be to find something else unless you've got some serious PC skills. The only thing that is useful is the GoBack software, which lets you restore your PC after serious problems develop...Ironically, I mainly use it to restore my PC after it gets screwed up by another Norton application."
3,GoBack component of SystemWorks is unreliable,"I'm using Windows XP Pro on a new Dell PC with Norton SystemWorks. GoBack is part of SystemWorks, but a file called goback2k.sys made my computer totally unusable. After putting my computer in suspend mode, every time I tried to restart the computer I got a blue screen with an error message referring to goback2k.sys. I couldn't even get Windows to start in Safe Mode; the blue screen appeared every time with the same error message referring to goback2k.sys. I had to reinstall Windows to solve the problem."
1,WINDOWS XP and NSW2003 = CRASH!!!,"Like so many others, I installed NSW2003 as an upgrade to a perfectly good NSW2001. This was probably one of the worst things I have done since I got my first computer 20 years ago. I have Windows XP HOME and the first thing that happened was a warning box that would popup at boot that claimed ACCESS DENIED DRIVE C. Within minutes my computer started slowing down and I was having trouble running programs. Finally, after the third resart, the computer crashed. My 9 month old DELL had been operating flawlessly until I installed this software. I tried SAFE MODE and tried to uninstall this renegade program, but it wasn't there. I ended up having to slick the drive and start all over again. Subsequently, I read a number of critical reviews on this product. I only wish I had done my research before installing this dangerous program."
1,Listen to the Negative folks....The have a real Axe to grind,Forget that Norton has a good name... I even executed a system rollback to try and rid my computer of it after it failed to uninstall. That just damaged it enough to cause a blue screen....
1,SystemWorks 2003,This is the biggest piece of junk that Norton has ever released. After numerous attempts to upgrade from 2002 to 2003 my computer was finally fried and I had to do a system restore. I have used Norton for about 3 years without problem but this release is a lemon. Stay away from it.
2,Too many appications to work with!,"This product has too many different utilities to work with. It often gets confusing and frustrating to know which tool to use. I have found it to slow down PCs considerably, especially with the Norton System Doctor running in the background. Stick with the utilities your Windows operating system originally gave you."
2,Not what I expected,"I've been using NSW 2.0 for the last 3 years, and I love it. But NSW2003 loses some program functions I used all the time. The antivirus for it is great, but as a whole, I am very disappointed with this release."
2,Not as good as the first two albums,"I was huge Just Ice fan back in the day, trippin threw all these old school reviews i thought i would comment on this album being the first. I remember when Just Ice got quite a bit of video play on Yo MTV Raps. His first two albums where hardocore rap at the time and in my book is still hardcore. This album Gun Talk just was not the same, i listen to a few tracks and couldn't bare to listen to it anymore. It wasn't the hardcore Just Ice in the previous two albums which is a must for any old school rap fan. You can pass this one up in my opinion."
2,Disappointing,"I ordered two of these at the same time, one for myself and one for my wife. Neither has been satisfactory, each for its own reasons.The multi-function button on the first one was difficult to push and required too much pressure on the in-ear speaker, making the headset uncomfortable to use. Any background noise rendered voice commands completely inoperable -- not that they worked well even in a quiet room. Finally, after about 6 weeks of light use, it simply quit working ... period!The second one seemed to have none of the problems of the first, but one evening I forgot to remove it when visiting a family member. I put it into my pocket, sat down to eat dinner, and when I got up the speaker had just snapped off.Think I'll try something different this time."
5,Old school collection of urban myths and legends,"Strangely Enough is a fun collection of old wives' tales, ghost stories and legends. I remember reading this as a kid and I recently bought a copy of it. I wish the original version in it's unabridged form was available. But other than that minor complaint it's quite an enjoyable read."
1,Is this a joke??,"Michel's voice is OK, but the interpretation of Dylan's songs, and the sonic mess that Montecrossa conjours up, is totally ludicrous. Chicago public radio has a 5 minute show each week (anything more than 5 minutes would be cruel and unusual punishment) called ""The Annoying Music Show,"" for which all songs here (and on all other Montecrossa recordings) would be prime fare.There is nothing redeeming here due to Montecrossa's bland singing style and the over-wrought synthesized production. It sounds like Peter Frampton meets Tubular Bells. Don't bother."
3,not quite what I thought,This CD does a great job of what it tries to do.. show the balance and movement of the human figure in motion. It isn't quite as usefull as an aid to figure drawing as I thought it would be though. I suspect someone would have to be pretty seriously involved in animation or advanced painting to make effective use of this resource.
3,China in the World,It is a movie about modern China where mosaic of characters' interactions has been assembled on a landscape of The World Park presenting iconic landscapes from around a globe.
1,Hugely Frustrating Waste of Time and Money,"I would like to echo the sentiments of many of the previous reviewers.Having happily used NIS2002 and Systemworks2002 for a year, my subscription was expiring, and I decided to ""upgrade"" (HA!) to NIS2003.The problems started as soon as I installed the software - it did not work on my system (p4 1.7) at all. Then I discovered that to even speak to a support techician would cost almost $30.I repeat - even though I bought a product which did not work AT ALL, I could not get tech support without paying almost $30.Next, I tried to uninstall the program, but it would not allow me to (it told me I had anti-virus running, which I did not). I finally had to search around on the confusing support website to find a program which would uninstall the software.Now, I am returning the product for a refund and switching to one of Symantec's competitors. It is a real shame because I thought the 2002 versions of internet security and antivirus were great products."
4,Norton Internet Security 2003,"2003 IS SO MUCH EASER TO LOAD THAN 2001. IT HAS INTUITIVE LOGIC FOR ACCOMPLING TASKS. IT WORKS WITH IE5 WITH IE5s PATCH. DOWNLOADS FROM SYMANTEC ARE EASE. VERY GOOD PACKAGE. BE SURE TO UNINSTALL ANY CURRENT VIRUS PACKAGES ON YOUR SYSTEM.. MY SYSTEM RUNS WIN 98, STANDALONE. ALL THREE OUR PCs ARE STANDALONE."
1,Awful! Don't Buy It,"I've always liked Norton prior to NIS 2003. Now I'll never ever buy a Symantic product again. I've had nothing but problems with my computer since installing this buggy software and Symantec does not support the software unless you're willing to pay for them to debug their code. It was a complete waste of my money. I had to buy other software to replace this junk because the internet was incredibly slow with it on, pages wouldn't display unless I refreshed several times, and I continuously had fatal email errors after installing it. I can't say enough bad things about this CPU hogging software.This does not even deserve 1 star."
1,Breaks software then forces to pay for new license,"As mentioned by another reviewer, Norton Security 2003 was broken by their LiveUpdate patch last week if you were running Windows XP.I have been corresponding with their tech support for the last week trying to get it fixed. They finally told me I had to uninstall and reinstall following their specific instructions. I uninstall and now cannot reinstall because I'd originally downloaded the install file and do not have a copy of it. They will not give me the install file even though I am subscribed for the year and they are the ones who broke the software in the first place.Symantec breaks their software then tries to force customers to buy new licenses in order to fix it. Do not trust them or believe what their tech support personel tells you."
1,Not quite ready for prime time,I've been a loyal Nortons user for years and recently upgraded from Norton Antivirus 2002 and Personal Firewall 2002 to the 2003 versions. The new Norton Antivirus works like a charm. The Personal Firewall 2003 (also a component of Internet Security) has a bug in it that prevents group emails (roughly 6-10 or more email addresses) from being delivered and forces a reboot of the computer to be able to send/receive mail again. Many dozen Personal Firewall 2003 users have duplicated the exact problem and reported it on Symantec's support site. Symantec agrees that many users report this problem but their support staff haven't found a fix yet.My suggestion is to wait until the problem is fixed before buying a product which limits the usefulness of email.
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, Id give it zero starts if I could.","I was having a problem on my computer that we discovered was corruption in NIS 2002 and since I was just a few months away from my subscription expiring, I went ahead and purchased NIS 2003. Big mistake. As of this moment, I still dont have 2002 entirely uninstalled or ever had a sucessful installation of 2003. My father is a computer programmer and familiar w/ Symantec products and we spent about 18 hours trying to uninstall and reinstall the two products this weekend. It's horrifying that Symantec would charge 30 bucks to customers for help fixing their installation bugs and finding help on their website was very difficult (even if you know what you're doing). I will never buy a Symantec product again. I will also be writing to PC Magazine to challenge their recommendation. BEWARE."
1,Do not buy this product!,"This software is a mortal disaster. Even when I tried to uninstall it, it would not uninstall properly and, of course, I cannot reinstall it properly either.Support from Symantec is nonexistent. 6 emails to them have gone unanswered, as soon as they take your money, they want nothing more to do with you.I cannot recommend this prodect in the slightest, it can destroy your computer ( as it seems to have done to mine ) and is, ironically, worse than the worse virus you could ever encounter to remove."
1,NIS 2004 - if I could give zero stars...,"This product gives 100% protection by blocking you from the internet completely. Worse, you can't uninstall it. Don't bother to call Tech Support as each phone call will cost about as much as buying a new product.Like other customers I had problems logging on as ""Supervisor"" in order to uninstall, as there was no log on/log off screen (contrary to what the screenshots in the manual show you).I finally managed to get access by creating a new Windows XP user with the same name as the NIS Supervisor account that I was barred from. I then logged myself off XP and logged onto XP again as this ""Supervisor"". Suprisingly, it worked. When I opened up Norton Internet Security, I found that it had automatically logged me on as Supervisor as well.Now that is Norton *security*.But anyway I was relieved; the bug allowed me to happily go about removing this useless software package from my computer."
3,old and good,the game was fun and good. my past experience in the game made it to easy but thats alright.definitly suggest this game to others.
4,Harry Potter is back ! ! ! ! !,Harry Potter is back in a great new adventure. When I bought this game it was so mutch fun that I did not want to stop. The game is so cool but sometimes it is very hard like at the giant spider aragog. You get to fly to Hogwarts batle your enemy's earn new spll's and be Harry Potter! I have so mutch fun. If you are a Harry Potter fan you should buy it and it is not vilent.
5,Great Coloring Book For Kids To Learn,"As alot of people, me and my kids are obssed with anything Titanic. This was perfect for my six year old, because she loves to color and can learn about the inside of the Titanic and can understand it better."
1,Poor quality.,"I purchased this same item from Home Depot not more than 6 months ago. I only do laundry about 1 to 2 times per month, so I'm not even using it that much. From day 1, one of the ties on the side had ripped. Now, all 4 are coming apart. Last time I was getting my laundry ready, I had trouble moving the wheels on the cart, only to discover one of them had already broken. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this item unless you intend only to purchase yet, another new one. Shame on you Whitmor for charging what you do for such a shoddy item."
3,My bag broke too!,"Although I love the apperance of the sorter, and have been a faithful Target shopper for many many years. I was disapointed that the bag broke after only a few days. I was less than hard on it in my opinion, and it is almost unusable now. My bag too, has had all four ties break off, and a large hole is forming. I have attempted to re-sew to no avail. A new bag would be great! To bad they don't make them that I am aware of."
3,canvas corners ripped quickly,"corners of canvas, and ties ripped quickly and easily come off if bin gets to medium fill. Can not find replacement canvas bag."
2,"Nice cart, cheap bag","I, too, have had the same problem with the ties tearing off, and also the compartment sides have torn. It is still usable but annoying. For the price this costs, the bag should be much more durable. I saw another one listed for cheaper that appears to have a more durable bag. I had been hoping to get a replacement bag for this one, but I guess I can't get one. Guess I'll have to invest in yet another laundry sorter. Ugh!"
2,3 Compartment Laundry Sorter,"The wheels off my Laundry Sorter have fallen off several times. The worst promblem is the Canvas Liner it is ripped and torn. The manufactor should offer a replacement liner. I would never purchase this item again,"
2,Bag is weak and flimsy,"I finally sprung for a nice, metal laundry sorter, b/c the plastic one I'd had before kept coming to pieces. I thought that a sturdier metal construction would hold up better. Alas, I did not anticipate that the bag would practically disintegrate in such a short time! The material is thin and the stitching is poor--the holes where you slide it over the poles have ripped open, and the pieces of fabric that separate the compartments have come unstitched also. I will try to contact the manufacturer as a previous reviewer suggested, but I don't hold much hope even if a replacement bag is offered if it is of the same quality as this one. Too bad, b/c the metal frame is sturdy and rolls smoothly--all it needed was a better liner!"
2,Nice but have bag issues,"I echo the reviews of the the others. The sorter is nice, but required a sew repair job to remain functional. Since then, it has been OK and even survived a few washings. I had it for two years and now the corner hook hole ripped and cannot be repaired. Given that the bag will wear out sooner (usually) or later, Target needs to make replacements accessible and available."
4,It works,"I love it, it keeps everything seperated so it is easy at when it comes time to do laundry. I have bought seperate bags for each section, that I can remove, this makes it easier to move the laundry for the upstairs to the basement."
3,"Useful book on twins, but over generalizes","There are some aspects of this book that I found very illuminating, but as a fraternal twin there are several statements presented as fact that are absolutely false. I suspect that she is viewing all her data through the lens of her experience as an identical twin and as a woman. Furthermore, her data set of 30 twin pairs is far too small to encompass all the possible twin combinations and relationship dynamics. I enjoyed several parts of the book, but some conclusions need to be taken lightly. Also, she mostly ignores the differences between boys and girls when examining twin patterns."
4,Still Missing Some Details and Organization (otherwise very good),"This is generally a VERY good book! Still, given minimal initial knowledge of Herpetology, the book can be somewhat ambiguous and disorganized and is missing a few essential details such as habitat and food for families of reptiles and amphibians in the necessary chapters. It requires more photographs and better taxonomic organization for clarity."
3,Some nice character bits but too much emphasis on Wesley!,"The book has some nice (but rather too obvious) links to the first season of The Next Generation (examples such as Dr Crusher telling Yar that she doesn't want to see her in her sick bay again come to mind.) There are also some 'touching' bits with Wesley trying despiratly to help a friend, save the farm animals and probably the known universe. The characters are not too obvious in the moral message (by Trek standards anyway) although the idea of the Enterprise transporting an entire community plus animals is a leeeetle far fetched. All in all an enjoyable book to curl up with on a wet afternoon, and better than quite a few Trek books I have read. Not one of the best though."
3,Marsha,"This product was OK, but its too small to be called large.Sorry.MarshaPS And a little too much cost."
5,Norton Personal Firewall 2003 runs well under XP,"Symantec seems to have ironed out the kinks in the Internet Security software running under Windows XP. The software installed and updated itself and immediately began protecting the system which uses a cable modem with a router. The AD blocking is working well. I plan to buy another copy to run on another computer that is on the same cable modem. The firewall rules were automatically adapted to my usage - where as the last version could never seem to remember the rules and kept asking about internet access - so much so - that it was uninstalled. The trace feature is kind of nice, I received a TCP illegal flags attack and it tracked it down to Minneapolis and one from Bejing China."
3,Be Careful With Upgrades & Live Updates,"I have been running Norton Personal Firewall 2003 for several months now and I have been happy with it. However, Norton has a Live Update feature which updates your software when new versions are available. Of course, you would think this process would be reliable but they recently installed a patch that has caused a lot of problems for a lot of users. When the firewall works it works well. When something is wrong it can affect a lot of your software. After making the last update my whole Windows startup is screwed up and many of the serices don't start. Don't expect any support either. If you can't find it in their Knowledge Base, it costs $$$ just to contact a Support Person."
4,Good,"This game is really good. The graphics are great for a gba, and controlls are easy to learn. The action is constant so you wont be board. BUT ONLY BY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE A GOOD GBA LIGHT OR A GBA SP. The game is really dark and its hard to see the small characters without good lighting. But buy this game if you have 35 dollars laying around, its worth it if your a fan of LOTR or of the RPG diablo style."
5,uuhhhhhhhhhh,"I am a huge rings fan and happy I bought this game. My only complaint is lighting in some areas, but there is a solution... buy a light(um duh)which is what I did. I especially like Aragorn and Legolas (where's Gimili?)because they have the best weapons and roles in the game. The best part of the game is the in-depth character cutsomization. You pick up enemies' weapons or armor and put it on yourself however you want. There are also stats and techniques you can customize."
4,Lord of the Rings 2,"If you saw Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and loved it, then you'll love this game! You can be Aragon, Legolas, Frodo, Gandalf, or Eweon. This game is challenging, and players will love it!Based on the movie, players will love it!"
4,THE best GBA game they could make!,"This game is so awesome! If you wan't a good Action/Adventure/RPG then get this! There is NO better game in the world!I'm very glad EA made it, Black Label did a lowsy job of making the Fellowship.Get this game I would pay a MILLION bucks for it!"
5,in love,my children and my students are in love with Kirikou. This is a great video and I hope they continue to make more episodes.
4,An important subject.,"Despite its age, this is a great book dealing with the end times and the final Battle of Armageddon."
3,Odd Ducks,"As a vocalist, Terami fills her tunes with an expressive midrange voice. Her keyboards on ""The Breathing"" maximize the creative tension. Her melody on ""Boxes"" sounds almost Eastern European. Her music is complex, more arty than catchy or pop. Some tracks like ""Fire"" and ""Falling"" fail to grab me. Her classicly trained piano is beautiful, but her songs seem like odd ducks as far as pop tunes. I'm glad I've heard her music, but don't find myself wanting to revisit it nor explore other releases. Enjoy!"
2,Poor NTFS/Win2000 support; few CDRWs supported,"I bought this to try and rescue a non-booting Win2k machine. Window's CHKDSK wasn't fixing the problem, so I thought I'd buy Norton's in the hopes that it would keep me from having to reformat and reinstall Windows. Even though Win2k is clearly marked as supported on the box, few of Disk Doctor's features actually work with Win2k's NTFS disk formatting. I ended up having to reinstall Windows and recovering what data I could manually.Ghost seemed like it would be really useful, but Ghost's ""burn image directly to CDRWs"" option didn't work with either of the CDRW drives that I tried (TEAC CDW28E or HP 8210e).Speed disk seems to work fine, which is about the only good thing that I have to say about SystemWorks so far. To be fair, Win98 seems much more fully supported, but that doesn't help my Win2k laptop! (And who buys Win98 anymore??)Summary: avoid for Win2000, maybe OK for Win98."
2,Banging My Head on the Desk,"I've had mostly good luck with previous versions of Norton's Utilities and Internet Security. Until now. For reasons that I still don't understand, LiveUpdate mostly doesn't work. Fortunately, AntiVirus updates but nothing else will. I went to the Norton site and waded through pages and pages AND PAGES of help documents. I was instructed to manually uninstall everything, including registry entries--a daunting task to the average user--and reinstall all Norton's programs. Still no luck. I keep getting a message that says the update program catalogs are unavailable. I've burned up hours and hours trying to solve this problem and I'm back to where I started. The most aggravating support document advises, ""Reinstall the products in the correct order."" What?? And the idea of paying $30 per event for live tech assistance is unthinkable.Sometimes new is is not better."
3,Does not work with Server edition operating systems,Buyer beware! This software does not work with any server edition operating systems!
2,Hard to Hear,"I purchased this CD having never previewed it but basing my selection solely upon reviews listed here. Unfortunately, I was most disappointed not with the content but with the audibility of the CD. My intent was to listen to it at bedtime but found Ms. Blumenfeld's voice too difficult to hear at a volume suitable for late evening. For me, the difficulty was two part. First, her sentences tended to fade out towards the end. Second, the soothing background music at times drowned out her voice. Rather than the creation of a relaxing experience, the strain of trying to catch what she was saying increased my anxiety and I put on Sound Healing by Dean Evenson instead! This tape may be fine for others but I recommend finding an opportunity to listen to it for yourself prior to buying."
5,A very practical book for non-lawyers,"With escalating competition from every angle; an extremely volatile marketplace; and mounting scrutiny that is being placed on businesses, their leaders are seeking new ways to continue to do business not only legally, but ethically, personably, economically. Goldman and Sigismond have provided a road map to threading on the legal mines without being blown away. For non-lawyers, like me, there is no doubt that this work will provoke a lot of interest and challenges to business leaders who find themselves dealing with a lot of conflicting issues today; and where legal and ethical ""maybes"" - the gray lines, are more prevalent than before. It appears that through the numerous cases, Goldman and Sigismind sensed a need to show non-lawyers how to navigate through the legal landmines safely. [Nwankama Nwankama]"
2,Only good if you're completely new.,Lot of book is common knowledge. Chapters too long. Examples at end of chapters aren't very creative. Definitely a starter/intro level book.
2,"Good for beginners, but likely to upset anyone else!","If you're buying this book for yourself, spare yourself the headache. It is certainly not of any academic value, and considering what I've read so far, it does even appear to be a business law book. The book chronicles very simple and basic legal matters, and presents these topics in such a way, someone interested in a thorough discussion of them would likely become upset.As I said before, unless you have a very basic interest in law, ignore this book as much as you can. Also, because the book is not state-specific, there's not much you can get out of the book. It presents general information, which is of no use to those who want to learn specifics.I've given it two stars just because it would probably be good for a beginner."
5,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!,"If you have not tried these marvelous sweet yellow corn treats (and you don't mind paying the asking price), you will find one of the most delicious snacks made! I MUST ration my consumption of these, because I ""could"" easily eat a whole boxful in a week, or maybe a day. :) So, I saved a few dollars by using the ""subscription plan"". Now I should always have a supply. Another point, if you share a bag, be prepared to have that person ""eat it all"". Everybody loves this stuff. I don't know for sure what the process is to make this, but it is NOT full of chemical junk. It is literally like having the taste of whole kernel corn (with the water removed) in a bag. Very lightly salted, too."
5,Mesmerizing,I love this movie! I've always been a fan of Colin Firth & he gives a wonderful performance in this movie. It makes you think about Vermeer in a whole new way. I recently bought the book. I hope it proves to be as spell-binding as the movie. Enjoy!
3,Not like the book,"I had high expectations for the movie and was pretty let down by it. There was just so much of the book left out of the movie, not only important events but also characters. I also didn't like the way the movie ended, with out reading the book you would never know what happened.But after reading the book, it was a lot of fun to see the characters on screen and see the book come to life. It's worth it to watch the movie if you have read the book."
2,"Great Artistic set design, Movie was a waste of time","Beautiful set designs, but hey - you were dealing with one the all time Dutch masters. Tedious acting - the main female lead doesn't speak for the 1st 15 minutes. Colin Firth was miscast - not at all believable in his role. 3rd rate effort."
4,The maid who inspired the artist!,"Beautifull, subtle and delightfull would be the words to describe this film. This film despite being brief, is really amazing and throws light on Vermeer quite well, played by the versatile Colin Firt. Scarlett Johannson was beyond words, her potrayal of the young maid was simply beautifull and so was Essie Davis in the role of the painter's wife. Truely amazing performences by everyone in the film. This is a unique, exceptional film, really worth a watch. My rating 4.2 / 5"
4,Near-Perfect Adaptation Of An Imaginative Novel,"This entire movie LOOKED like a Vermeer painting brought to life, as if the long-ago figures immortalized by that Dutch master had somehow stepped onscreen. An amazing feat in and of itself. This is a faithful adaptation of Tracy Chevalier's novel of the same name, and it elaborates on what is known (i.e. nothing) about the model in the famous portrait, and in so doing the motion picture crafts an entire backstory to explain the creation of a haunting painting. This movie is also a skilled depiction of life in the Netherlands three and a half centuries ago, during the one and only time that nation was a world power. And let's not forget the fine performances here by Colin Firth, and of course a siren-like and yet skillfully subdued Scarlett Johansson. This is one to see!"
5,Girl with the Pearl Earring,The movie was great. There were no scratches on the DVD and the case was in good condition as well. I would definitely buy from this seller again in the future.
1,Whats the big deal?,"Scarlett Johansson was excellent in Lost and Translation, however this movie was slow and boring and really didn't get deep enough into any of the characters. I left this movie with no understanding of Vermeers motives or struggles, no indication of how rough Greits life must have been, although it was attempted though that short montage of her doing the chores. Watch something else."
2,St. Luther,A slow and boring film which glorifies and worships Luther more than those who followed him during the Reformation.
2,not for me,This book has a lot off biophysics and so many unnecessary equations for a medical student. This book is probably for those who are interested in doing lab research or need a keen understanding of molecular and biophysical properties of cells. As a med student in 1st year this book when compared to other books is of no use. May be to take a peek now and then as i already bought it. sorry this book is not for me.
2,No breeze - decorative only.,"This fan looks good while it turns but 4 ""D"" Batteries provide no breeze what so ever. Bought with hopes of keeping bugs away! No Luck. Would not recommend at all.Sorry, TW"
2,I Think I Will Continue Using My Drill Press Mortiser,After reading your reviews on the Delta Mortising Tool I think I will continue Using my craftman drill press with mortising atachment. I thought this was hard enough to set up and keep adjusted sounds like I would just be spinning my wheels to buy a new DELTA MORTISER
1,At last! An X album I DON'T like!,"Here I thought they were infallible and they go do this one-off ""ner ner"" music that inspires intimate thoughts regarding blood relations and livestock. I played it backwards and not only did I sober up, but my wife came back to me, my dog came back to life, my truck got fixed, the bank took the lien off my house and I bowled a perfect game!Signed,epsteinsmutha"
1,Antique Trader Clocks Price Guide: Including All Types of Clocks - 17th through 20th Century (Antique Trade Clocks Price Guide),"A brave title with ""ALL Types of Clocks"" and it disappointed as it did not include many (if any) small Boudoir Clocks. Few 20th Century clocks only 1 electric clock. Few mentions of swiss clocks of note. NO INDEX - what sort of book dose not have an index.Like many American authors - if it does not happen in the USA it does not happen.I would not recommend this book to those who collect clocks from ""the world"" as the world is greater than the USA."
4,Decorating with Mosaics,"This book is great for the begginer such as myself. Pleanty of ideas to try, and also the start of designing something on your own. I looked at several other books on mosaics, and found them interesting , however, for the begginer and/or the craft person who dosent need to know the why's and wherefores, these other books, I found, were for the art student, or perhaps art teacher. For someone who wants to learn how to do mosaics in her/his home for the FUN of crafting, this book answered my questions, and gave me the oportunity to make some very wonderful mosaics projects! My friends are asking me to make some projects for them. What better compliment can one have! Thank you."
3,Another one-hit band with some other gems,"I saw Bubble Puppy back in 1969, when they (and Spirit) were opening for Canner Heat at Detroit's Masonic Temple. They were a pretty good live act, and it's a pity that the production standards of the time don't capture their live act very well on record.They had one big hit, of course, ""Hot Smoke and Sasafrass"" which is still heard occasionally on some oldies station. The rest of the album is nice proto southern rock, with a hint of the sound we'd hear later from the Allmans and even a bit of that Greatful Dead sound. Not bad."
4,Surprisingly excellent!,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this album. I knew ""Hot Smoke and Sassafras"" was a great tune, but thinking of my experience with many of the one hit wonder records of the genre, I had low expectations. This album is very solid and should have been a great party album for its time. Very reminiscent of Love especially their post ""Forever Changes"" period. Buy it if you are into that kind of thing or if you just like ""Hot Smoke"". The rest of the album supports it very well. Some of the bonus tracks kick butt too!"
4,Chef's Station,I saw the item at Home Depots Expo but your price was $20 cheaper so I got it and so has at least 2 of my friends.Thanks
4,no trouble,"No complaints.Thanks.I must write twenty or more words to satisfy the requirements in order to submit this review.I believe I have fofilled this request asked for by the staff.If not,I will recount the words.thanks again / John"
3,Outdated,Needs to be updated. Poor print quality. No mention of internet markets and customer ratings. Would recommend reading something printed in the current century.
3,A bit too much for me,While all the information was there the writer wrote as though he thought everyone had Phd's or doctorate. Had to re read and re read!
1,Crap,"Broke in five shots. It is junk. Lets try repeating that....junk junk junk junk junk junk junk. Seriously, do not waste your money. Also the arrows can't penetrate jack."
2,CROSSBOW,U get what you pay for......that is all i can say really.It shoots straight for the first 5 feet but after that watch out
1,Fluffy PR,Read more like a press release or company-paid pr fluff than a detached history of the company. The corporate-speak hyperbole was enough to make one nauseous.
2,fair fare,"As my previous reviews show, I'm a Dion fan. Not this pair of albums though. I was unfamilliar with them and soon will be again."
1,The Game is Not Afoot!,"If you are a Sherlock Holmes fan you will be monstrously disappointed by this cheap cash in on the Downey Jr reworking. The plot is ludicrous and infantile, as is the script and acting. Ben Syder is totally miscast as the detective, in fact, he is the worst Holmes I've seen next to Patrick Macnee in 'The Hound of London', and he stunk to high Heaven!"
4,Steampunk Sherlock,"English cast, steampunk, and Sherlock Holmes. What more needs to be said?If you want to read more . . . The special effects are good to above-Asylum-average. Some of the plot points are ridiculous, and some require more explanation. However, fans of Sherlock Holmes can fill in the blanks and appreciate the extra references regarding Holmes. Holmes is both intelligent and heroic . . . and possibly a recovering drug addict. Watson is not a bumbling idiot but is instead a doctor and everyman. Watson is not subservient to Holmes but his equal.Despite the shortcomings, it all feels correct. Even the ending makes sense and is fulfilling, unlike many Asylum movies."
2,As a Steampunk movie I kinda liked it,"I recorded the movie from Satellite and watched it later on. As a Steampunk movie, I kind of liked it and it gave me some ideas for Steampunk equipment and storylines. As a Sherlock Holmes movie, it tried, but was marginal. I think it was the actor who portrayed Holmes, he was nowhere near up to the standards of others who have played Holmes. It is worth watching if you can catch it for free on one of the movie channels or network movies, but I wouldn't pay money for it."
5,excellent,"this book is an outstanding review of global oil security and american foreign policy. it provides a comprehensive history, the book is well-written and easy to understand. really enjoyed it."
1,A waste of money,I am not sure what NBC was thinking when they made this video. If you want to see unedited series of snippits from games and then the last 20 minutes of the Women's final with the infamous GOOOOOAAAAALLLL being shouted until you are deaf then this one is for you. An embarassing effort!
5,Almost Undescribable,"A beautiful compilation of songs that seriously reach out and touch your heart. You won't be able to stop listening or get the songs out of your head. I haven't come across a CD as good as this in a while. It's so real, so personal, and so inspiring... it's almost undescribable."
2,How Predictable,"A silly, light read with a very predictable story line: beautiful girl washes ashore after a shipwreck, lonely lighthouse keeper finds her, you know the rest. Not nearly as good as Lakeshore Chronicle books."
5,Susan Wiggs is THE master!,"Every book Susan Wiggs writes is a masterpiece of the human condition. She knows how we think, feel, see, hear and touch our way through life. She does so in such detail that we are beautifully carried through each story with the same emotion as the characters in every book. As with all her books, The Lightkeeper is a total keeper!"
3,Straightening Iron,"Works great, however when using the steam feature the water just pours out. Not much steam."
3,Sound quality is pretty poor,"I bought a house that had this system through out it. Works good as intercom but the speaker quality is very poor for music. One was broken so I was stuck with this and I had to buy it, it does the job but I would not advise in buying it if you don't already have the full system and can still pick better speakers for music outside."
2,Nutone not a good as before,The quality of the sound in this recent purchase is much poorer than the same model purchased 8 years ago. Let the buyer beware.
5,Nutone Patio Speaker,I received the Nutone Patio speaker in less time than the seller advertised and it was in perfect condition upon arrival. It took about 15 minutes to remove the old one and install the new one. Worked perfectly.Good buy.
2,go with smaller pool for easier set up,We had a smaller version of this pool before and loved it. this one takes too long to set up and is cumbersome. smaller on is great
1,Do not buy!,"This pool's rim is so stretched out it will not contain more than a few inches of water. I drilled a hole near the edge and bolted it together to create less stretch, but it still will not contain more than 6 inches. Id had one like this before that worked very well but this one was a big disappointment. Don't buy."
1,Snapset pool is not a snap to fill,"Pool is safe with no sharp edges but is very difficult to set up, keep water from falling out (sides do not stand up and are way too flexible). Thinking about returning."
3,big hit at the party!,"this is a great pool for kids! it's not built to last, but we'll get a summer out of it! didn't expect to pass it down to the grandkids in 50 years."
5,LOVE IT,No compaints at all... set it up on a wood patio and it's plenty of room for myself and my two children (3years and 18months). I fill it about10 inches deep or so. Very happy with this purchase and would buy it again and recommend it to friends~
2,Great pool but it broke,"I absolutely love this pool - easy, big, fun. I had one previously for years, but got one this year and the side cracked after using it only a few times when someone fell on it. Quite a big disappointment."
5,WOW!!!!,"I first saw Blast live in Chicago. I received the DVD as a gift & was so excited. The DVD is just as amazing as it is live. I absolutely loved this show. knowing how difficult it is to march and perform a 20 min performance, it is even more amazing to see these people do so much more for 2 hours. There's nothing else i can say, except the title of this review, WOW!!!!"
3,Not bad,Film not bad. Moved a bit slow for us. Did have decent character development. Actors did a nice job with the material given.
5,5 STARS,"One of the better Vietnam War books. Well-written, interesting, enjoyable, and never self-promoting. Comes across as the Real Deal."
4,Pretty good,"I have these speakers in my sailboat. The sounds is good, but not exactly hi-fi. I'd go bigger next time."
1,Not Worth Your Time,"I'm a huge Sandra Brown fan and have read most of her books, but I hated this one. To me, the romance between the main charactors was appalling. An attractive prosecutor falls for a foul-mouth cowboy old enough to be her father, and who had sexual relations with mother. It's the first time I ever skipped over the romance scenes of a novel! Brown is the best storyteller for a great mystery, but in ""Best Kept Secret"" the build up of who-did-it ended with a big let down.I suggest reading another Brown novel. My favorites (in order): ""The Witness,"" ""Exclusive"" and ""The Switch."""
2,Not her best,"I thought Best Kept Secrets was all right. It was definately not a page turner like most other Sandra Brown books. I would recommend this one for a rainy afternoon when you have absolutely nothing else to do. Normally once I begin one of her novels, it's hard for me to put them down, but this one was not that way. I did manage to finish it, but it was definatly not the best I've ever read."
2,"Not the best, but not the worst","I thought Best Kept Secrets was an all right novel. It definately wasn't one of Sandra Brown's best, but it's not the worst thing in the world to read either. I would recommend this one for a rainy afternoon when you have nothing else to do. Normally, once I begin on of Ms. Brown's novels, it's hard for me to put it down, but this one was fairly easy to quit reading and do other things. It just seemed to drag on and on about the same thing over and over."
1,A lame stinker,"Somehow, for some reason, Brown has combined a lame specimen of the mystery genre with an explicit, bodice-ripper romance. It doesn't work. The plot and events are improbable, the characters are mostly shallow and stupid. It promotes a sappy and destructive concept of love and romance. I'm glad I was alone in the car while listening to the CD, since the sweaty scenes are not something you'd want your kids or mom to hear. Also, the actor reading the story was not very good. He sometimes mumbles unintelligibly and seems to mispeak on occasion. He does not do female voices well. They come across as a mocking caricature."
2,Blah,"I am very disappointed in this book. It has a lot of theory and analysis, but not the hands on care planning ideas I was looking for. Way overpriced for the amount of information in it!!"
4,Very erotic in parts...,"... but I also thought the plot was a bit weak at times. Early on there's a scene where a very dominant female prostitute forcibly seduces a fellow lady-of-the-night, and it was HOT!!! I mean, seeing a woman putting the moves on another woman is ALWAYS sexy to this viewer, but when she gets pushy about it it's hotter still! Nevertheless, the rest of the story about the police looking for a serial killer and as always going after the wrong guy was a bit too contrived for me. But I still think the girl-girl scene saved this video on the whole. Very creative and imaginative effort there by the writers, and good acting by the ladies involved! Applause applause!"
2,2 Stars for improper advertising,"I ordered this product because the product description stated that it worked on Jet mortising machines. I learned that the bit is much shorter than the bits that came with my Jet JBM 5 bench top mortiser. If you use this mortising machine, do not order this chisel. With the chisel inserted all the way into the machine, the drill bit is several inches short of the chuck."
3,Twain would appreciate your description.,"I am certain that Mark Twain would be highly amused to read your descriptive title of this collection -- ""The Unabridged Mark Twain (Abridged)""Keep 'em guessing, eh?"
1,Glasses made in China of inferior quality,"Glasses are made in Europe or China. Made in Europe, the glasses are a great value. Made in China, the glasses are of such inferior quality they are not worth the shipping. The risk of receiving the Chinese glasses are not worth the risk."
1,I only received 4 instead of 12,"I ordered these as wedding gift and had them delivered to the recipient. Only 4 arrived and my friend told me Amazon just recommended returning them for a refund as they couldnt correct it for some reason. THey are advertised as a set of 12, not 4.On the plus, my friend said they were of a good quality and just what she wanted, she just wanted all 12."
5,Sum & Substance Constitutional Law Audio CD Series,This is an excellent product for the study of constitutional law. My only regret is that I didn't purchase it prior to my mid-term exam.
3,Decent Overview,"For a law student who only works hard a week before the final, this was a decent overview of the materials for a Con Law course on individual rights and liberties (I did not use these CD's for the con law course on Nat'l Power and cannot say anything about those materials). It skipped over some important areas of law and was less detailed than it ought to have been. It would be best used as a beginning to an outline, one which needs to be finished."
2,"Bazooka BT6014 6-1/2"" subwoofer tube","Product was as described, except: In order to use this Bazooka BT6014 6-1/2"" subwoofer tube, you have to have Banana Plugs to hook up the wire to the unit. I have RCA Plugs on my Kenwood Car Stereo. I will have to solder the Banana plugs to the center wire of the RCA Plug............or I will sell it to someone on E-Bay using an Auction... As you can probably tell, I am not Happy with this Subwoofer..................................."
2,Sub-par guitar rock drone - their other records are better,"""Magnified"" is a very average record. Failure's 1st record ""Comfort"" and their 3rd ""Fantastic Planet"" (their last record before they broke up in 1997) are much more worth your hard earned cash. Still, if you like your guitars thick and loud, you may dig this one too. Coincidentally, there is a band named Magnified who have had their name before Failure used it. They are in New York City and are starting a huge buzz with their energetic, unforgettable guitar-based songs. Their independent CD is much more worth checking out!"
2,No answers,"This book is well written, but you cannot use it to teach yourself, since there is no answer key. The author includes review sentences that he wrote himself which would be much more useful if he included an answer key. There is no answer key for the Septuagint sentences, either, which differs from the Hebrew text, as the author himself admits. So I am puzzled why he would leave out English translations of those sentences, unless one has the LXX translated in English. A student must use an English translation of the Bible to check the New Testament examples. I cannot recommend this book, although it is much better than Vines book. I bought it by mistake."
4,very awesome movie,"yeah i admit the acting is a little cheesy but the scares more then make up for it,mimi kincade is a hottie,this is in my top 5 movies of all time,if u havent seen it then get it and scare the crap out of your girlfriend like i did :)"
4,great b movie,I looked high and low for this movie and 2 others and found them all on amazon .im sooo glad i found this movie its one of my favorite old time horror movies i enjoy the heck out of it . it cracks me up and isnt so scary as it is laughable . if you like corny scary movies you will like this one as much as i do its nice to every now and then to almost wet yourself from laughter than fright its not made to be funny when i was younger it did actually scare me now all grown up ive seen alot scarier movies.now i just need to buy number 2!
5,Evil Deadish,"Funny 80s horror, really sums this movie up. I loved it the first time I saw it. Alvin Alexis(Rog) responds to the statement ""if that was me"". The scene where he climbs the barbed wire is hilarious, Or when everyone is trying to get outside of Hull house and there is Rog outside of a window. Its also just edgy enough to make those humorous momments funny."
4,This Movie Rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I know, I know, when you first look at this movie, You say oh just another bad, low budget film. Well you're wrong. Night of the Demons is a GOOD low budget film!!!!!!!!!!It's funny and scary at the same time. The eerieness by which Angela moves gives the movie a complete and utter scareness that surpasses Evil Dead 2 by far. I watched it at night and believe me, it gave me the heebie jeebies. It's got a great story and an extremely unforgettable ending. If you are a fan of horror movies, get this one, you won't be disappointed!!!!"
5,Spindle Sandpaper works smoothly,This sandpaper leaves a smooth finish on hardwoods and it fits on the Ridgid combination belt and spindle sander. I couldn't find spindle sandpaper specifically for the Ridgid sander and took a shot on this. It fits fine.
5,Perfect mat for what I needed.,"Wanted a set of mats that actually protect the Rav, and these fit the bill. They fit very well and were easy to put in. They came with replacement carpet hooks for the drivers side, but the factory ones in my Rav fit the mats just fine, so I did not have to change those out. Very good quality on these."
1,not enough info,"it would be nice if you would put the dimensions of the product on the page. how long? how wide? How can buyers contact you? where is the contact seller option? when we select our truck to see if it matches, theres no option to put the length of our truck bed. no return information. very poor customer service."
4,Worth It,"I highly recommend the de luxe edition. In addition to the value of the content, the de luxe edition provides helpful laminated information cards, a detailed pull-out map, and an attractive cover."
1,"Ok, this is just dumb.","The creepy feeling and overall gloom that pervaded through Things Viral is completly lost here. The main problem being that is that the vocals are brought up too high in the mix. This was fine on Viral, but when the music isn't that interesting (It seems now that O'Malley is just hitting random chords), and Alan tries too hard to sound like Gollum (Feel me eat. Yeah, great lyrics there, pal!), it makes for a laughable mess. Perhaps I'm just not into this band as much as I used to."
3,Good book for a beginner.,"This is a beginner level book with very simple arrangements of about forty-five songs, none of them moving out of the first position. It's not bad for what it is, but I was expecting something slightly more challenging based on Amazon's description of it as a step into intermediate level playing. The author also has a book called ""Championship Flatpicking Guitar."" From looking at the excerpt online, that looks more appropriate for intermediate level players.A look inside the book would have quickly revealed the level of player this title is aimed at."
2,Disappointed,"We needed new recordable DVDs for recording shows and reviewing all that we found online about JVC products, decided to purchase these DVDs. Unfortunately, even though they are listed as one of the DVDs to use with our Sony, it does not recognize them and since we opened the box, are unable to return them.Hope you have better luck."
5,This is wonderful,"I cannot recommend this book enough! The short easy to remember stories stay with the child allowing him or her to create picture stories in the mind with the numbers. This is especially powerful for linguistic learners who may struggle with math. As an educator I know that it is vital for each child to have instant recall of basic math facts. If a child does not, one can be stuck processing the fact instead of learning a new operation. When the facts are known the mind can process the new information that it needs to in order to learn the new information. This book will really help children with the quick recall of multiplication facts."
3,Shaarei Shabbat,"Some of renditions on this cd are lovely, but the quality of the singing is inconsistent. Even though it is interesting to hear a variety of interpretations and most of these are well done, there is no flow, so the change from soprano to tenor comes a surprise, sometimes a jarring one."
4,Xerox Toner,"I purchased this for our company's Phaser 6180MFP. We used to have and HP MFP and that toner was a little more affordable. But the Phaser is a great printer and this toner, though more expensive, is very easy to use and works well. Off hand I am not sure how many pages it yields, but it is far more affordable then ink based printers."
5,Love moves mountains!,"This book explains how to get to the core of any desire and achieve your dreams. I love Jack Zufelt's's approach, that ultimately when we truly love what we do, we can't but succeed!Maria D.[...]"
2,not what i thought it was going to be,"To be brutally honest, I didn't like this book. At the beginning, the book purports that one shouldn't follow the age-old ""motivational tactics"" such as positive affirmations, writing down your goals etc, but then as I read along, that is exactly what this book is doing as well. There really is not much differentiating this book from all the other ""self help"" books that i've read so far...except for the fact that it's not one of the better ones. The examples of ""success"" are not very compelling, and the one part of the book that I really wish Zufelt would have elaborated on was _very_ skimpy -- ie, the part where he defines how to figure out what it is that you want. I was expecting this book to help my along my journey to finding the inner truth -- deep into the caverns of my mind to find out exactly what it is that i'm looking for. But, admittedly, maybe a book cannot provide this for anyone. Perhaps a career or motivational counsellor would work better."
3,Fun but a bit disappointing,"Seller: CD was in excellent condition and arrived quickly. Thank you.CD: I remembered ""Green Onions"" from my childhood as a really cool piece of music, and it still is. I was disappointed, though, that the rest of the album, with one exception, sounded like pretty much the same piece of music over and over. But for the price, I don't regret buying it."
2,"A movie featuring, but not necessarily about, The Clash.","This movie traces the steps of a ""roadie"", Ray Grange, as he catches on with the Clash during their rise through the English punk-rock ranks in 1977-78 London. The story is neither enlightening nor very entertaining, but for Clash purists, there are a few great moments, such as catching on film Joe Strummer in the sound studio laying down a vocal track, and Strummer sitting down at a piano back-stage before a show and lighting into song. Two stars simply for the 10-15 minutes of live Clash Music on film, which is so hard to find elsewhere. END"
4,Nice Series Entry,"As I have stated before, I do like this Mary Daheim series much better than the Bed and Breakfast series. The characters in this one are much more believable and the situations much more real-to-life. This episode revolves around a local judge getting a poison pen letter threatening her with exposure of a dark secret, about which she hasn't a clue. Ms. Daheim interweaves the current mystery with snippets from the past involving ancestors of the current Alpine residents, particularly those about which the story includes. She does a credible job with tying it all together and there were several aspects of this particular story I liked: Ed Bronsky, a character I do not care about, appears only in one scene; the story involves mostly Emma, Vida, and Milo; Emma is getting over the death of Tom. I would recommend this series to any mystery lover."
4,Should you buy the second edition or the first?,"A friend asked me whether he should buy the first edition for around $25 or the second for around $1.50. My response is below. I hope this helps anyone making the same decision!Here's what Pojman said about the changes from first to second editions:""I have made the following revisions for this edition: added a sectionon theories of truth to chapter 1, reversed the order of the twochapters on skepticism (chapters 2 and 3), revised the arguments inchapters 5 and 7 on coherentism, on externalism in chapter 8, and onnaturalism in chapter 10. I have also added an introductory 'Word tothe Student.' I trust and believe these and other minor improvementshave resulted in a better book."" (Preface to the 2nd ed., p. xiv)The revised arguments and added section on theories of truth seem likethey're important enough to pay the extra money."
3,Average,"This book is not the best orthopaedic book out there. It's organized into body parts as it's chapters and then discusses the anatomy, physiology, special tests etc. that is needed for evaluation. I had to buy this book as a required text for school, but I have hardly ever cracked it opened. If you are in need of a good ortho text I would recommend the Magee book as a reference, since this one is just ok."
5,A 4 star game but the price makes it a 5 star,"If you love FPS games, Serious Sam is for you. With Fantastic Graphics and cool 3D audio support this game will have you entertained for hours...The gameplay is nothing original, the enemy AI is not really impressive but it is still great fun by just the sheer amount of action you get(you will not believe the number of enemies this game will throw at you)."
5,Makes me want to try my hand at catching alligators.,Has continued to live up to the previous season's quality programming. Always an enjoyable show that helps to enlighten one to the diverse conditions faced when living off the land or in this case the swamp.
5,Great show,"Purchased for and by my husband, but I always ended up sitting down and watching a couple episodes with him. Very entertaining show, love most of the cast, will definitely be buying seasons to come."
2,this doesn't deserve one star...,"This movie is typical low-budget fare. I say low-budget only because the characters and the animation have a Saturday morning cartoon appearance. The cast is all-star, which might be the problem. All of the money was spent on actors!Snow White and the Prince are ok characters. There is an owl voiced by Ed Asner that could have been cut from the story, nothing against Asner. The owl is a perpetual cigar smoking violent character,nothing good there. The villan is the usual carbon copy villan with nothing new to add to the story.The movie had promise with the number of quality actors but fell short due to the writing and directing. I'm glad we borrowed this instead of buying."
1,worst ethnic movie EVER!,"I am simply amazed by this movies' ratings! How could people give such a junk movie 5 stars? I would have given it a ZERO. Why? Beacause it is a movie made by ignorant folks who have no knowledge of the Asian community. It is a highly offensive movie. It demonizes men as wife beaters (like nobody else on earth beats their wife), tyrannical father who ""all in all"" in the family and barely literate. Folks that made this movie, have absolutely no idea how Asians raise their kids in Asia and abroad. There are of course families that feels more attached to their roots and there are those who feels more connected to the new settlement. However, in this movie, it appears that the illiterate demon (the father) reamins a demon even after living 25 with an English woman. Watch this movie with ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"". You will see how racially insulting this movie is. Even you might feel ashamed that you have watched it. I know I am."
3,"Delta 37-380 8"" Jointer","This is a well designed, solid jointer, but Delta's pathetic quality control is aggravating. The 3 welds attaching the motor to the base were insufficient and in the case of one broken upon arrival. This was not difficult to fix but when you pay this much for a product you expect that it will be in working order. If you can afford the General 8"" model that is made in Canada (not China) go for it. If you stick with Delta expect flaws in workmanship and poor customer support."
2,Disappointed in Kenneth Cole....,"I purchased this as a Christams Gift for my mother. I know that KC has nice quality products under normal circumstances, but once my mom opened the watch she noticed that the leather on the band was cracked. Needless to say, I returned the gift and purchased another brand."
2,Fast Track to MDX,"This was a waste of $40. After creating a VPC I finally migrated all the examples in the book to SQL 2005 and SQL 2008 instances. However, since there have been so many changes since SQL 2000, the example database used in the book is totally irrelevant.I didn't notice that it was for SQL 2000. My bad.If anyone knows of a decent book on MDX for beginners to work with for versions of SQL 2005 or 2008, I would be interested.The book has a nice approach. Just not useful for editions higher than SQL 2000."
2,Tricky,"I found this book easy to read in spite of being repetitiveand very short (many pages have only a few linesand one screenshot).However, many important concepts were not explained well.I had some MDX queries that were taking hours to be completed.This book did not help me to speed them up.I had to get outside help. This book looks like ""MDX forDummies"" but without being the merits of that series."
2,learn a bit about SSAS,"This book appears at first read to be a winner. But one soon finds out that it is not all as easy as it appears. First and foremost, the included CD provides what appears to be a great selection of sample files, and great exercises that test your learning and knowledge of MDX; to use this software you need Microsoft SQL Server 2000. If you don't have this ancient piece of software accessible on a network, or loaded onto your own laptop, you will not be able to use the CD. Despite a new `Second edition' released in 2006, when SQL Server 2005 was available, the authors did not see fit to update the included CD to use this more easily available software.I eventually was able to locate and load SQL Server 2000 Analysis Services, and then load the necessary SP3; only then did the included Proclarity Software work.In the end, it turned out to be a great learning exercise. I did learn a lot about MDX, about MS SQL, and Analysis Services, an unexpected Bonus."
3,Addendum to my scathing earlier review!,"OK. I got Bugdom working after a little guidance from Tech Service.The problem was installing the OpenGL drivers. Once I had those set up properly AND new video drivers for my video card, I was off and running.It is a beautiful game that my seven year old navigates with ease.If it wasn't for the installation problems, I would recommend this game to everyone."
5,awesome!,"you wouldnt think that this game would be fun, but it is!!! i got it and love it! a must have for computer game lovers!!"
5,Very Dishy,This is an excellent set of interviews from real Chinese across China with interesting faces and sometimes moments of sheer comedy contrasting with the narrator's British accent e.g. Three ladies from Dongbei who look like ethnic Coreans hilariously discuss their encounters with the angelic Tibetans who enter their shop in Lhasa. The Uighurs get an up close profile with an emphasis on the women. I recommend this set without reservation to everyone not just Chinese.
5,One of Funniest Movie Ever!,This is one of the funniest movies we have ever seen. This is one of 4 or 5 movies that we view again every 3 or 4 years and it is just as funny each time. We laugh just thinking about the scenes especially Jose Ferrer with his flask.
3,The Other End of the Leash,I got some good information I could use so that was favorable. I was hoping for more training help rather than background (comparing humans to apes) vs. dogs. This is not a criticism but rather it was boring.
5,Brilliant perspective on human/dog communication!,"A must read for anyone considering a dog; there is so much that differs between us and dogs, it is not intuitive, this book drives awareness!"
5,Top Book about relating to your Dog,"Very readable.entertaining book to start with. The author's accreditations are very substantial. and this gives authority to the advice offered. The book interprets the many anecdotes soundly and from experienced that is easy to relate to and recognize. Guess I loved the book because it backed up many of my own intuitive beliefs of getting along with dogs and explains why this would be so. I feel much reassured from reading it and hope that it will benefit many other dogs and handlers to happy, comfortable relationships."
4,Excellent,"McConnell does a good job of increasing your insight of your dog's behavior. More important, it helps you understand what our actions communicate to our dogs."
3,"Good, but not what I expected","Patricia McConnell's book is a good read for dog lovers/owners, but it's an amalgamation of training tips, anthropologic observations, science of evolution, and personal anecdotes. If you are looking for a training guide to use in working with your dog, read this because it's interesting, but you'll still need a training manual."
4,"D's Voice, Lyrics... the Best Ever???","""...Poison..."" is, by far, PE's best accumulation of catchy, head-bobbing beats and clearly intense lyrics since ""...Black Planet."" After his incredible solo debut, ""Autobiography of Mr. Chuck"" (a collection staple for any sensible rap fanatic), Chuck D proves himself, once again, to be at the top of the game, both audibly and lyrically. Source Magazine hailed Rakim as the greatest of all time... I have a different opinion."
3,i really keep trying to like this album,"There are some good moments. THe intro, ""go our way,"" and LSD are stellar tracks. Flav does get annoying. His parts seem pointless on this album. Among the good and listenable tracks exist some let downs. When they start the chorus of here i go , or who's the real doctor death, it makes me cringe. This is an album i would probably sell someday if chuck didn't autograph my copy. If you are looking for pe, start from the beginning."
1,Clowns trying to rap...,This is sooo bad I had to laff all the way through that I my friend actually spent money for this.
3,Good Game,I enjoy playing this game. You really need a good video card in the later parts of a game to keep the great graphics.
4,"Great Fun, Teaching and Encouragement","This book is a lot of fun to look at and browse. The layout is clever and unusual and offers inviting illustrations of art technique and history. The knowledgeable and enthusiastic authors encourage beginners to dive in and start creating. I really like the open door approach. Unfortunately, the exercises they provide are often needlessly complicated, poorly organized and hard to follow. Other weaknesses are no page numbers (the table of contents has numbers though?) and obscure, rambling passages that might have been better left out. Still, this book contains many gems of technique and history - ready for discovery by the beginning and experienced artist alike."
3,Good story,"I enjoyed reading this old story of when Scudder was still drinking. Much of this is the same locked door/suicide that isn't a suicide that mystery readers may feel they have seen before, but Block is an entertaining storyteller, and this one pays off pretty well."
3,Short and easy!,"Having just come from a rather lengthy novel, a short story seemed just the ticket for my next read. This one is an old one, first published in 1977, but still works as a who-done-it mystery. While I enjoyed it and the brevity, I rate it as a decent read."
4,"Acryline 2, Temporary Denture Rliner,Kot","The instructions included with the kit was easy to follow but the product sets up real fast and I would suggest youput it in the fridge like the instructions say to slow down the setup time, prior to first time use.I am currentlyusing this product for about 3 weeks so far and I have not experienced any problems with it.I would recommend it."
2,Boring and not Woody Allen,"I thought this movie had a few funny moments, but most of the humor was simple and of the slapstick kind. The most disappointing part of the film was that I was expecting a parody of secular, Ashkenazi Jewish culture, a la Woody Allen, but it was a parody of so many Jewish traditions I never participated in or knew about (and I am Jewish), that I essentially found it uninteresting."
1,You'll love it or hate it,"Obviously I hated it.It's possible to do parody without being inane and boring. The sterotyping in HH was not only deeply offensive, it was trite and mostly unimaginative. Let's see... slovenly eating habits, chasing a penny, stupid Yiddish accents, fat oppressed little kids. Give me a break. And a lot more imagination."
5,Rorty's Greatest Postmodern Book,"In _Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity_, Rorty explores the end of objective realism due to linguistic faults in our language. I find Rorty's claims insightful and stimulating in this book, which is what we except from such a writer. In the book, Rorty examines the issue of our personal contingencies, and how the ideas that we have based on those contingencies should immediately placed under suspicion."
1,bolt breakers?,"this item seemed very nice as are my other denali items, but on the very first use, the handle broke clean in half."
2,wood working,"Hi,I inadvertently bought this item. However I find it to be too cumbersome and heavy. there is no belt sander and the disc is very difficult and timely to change. This seem to be more suited to large work shops . Not for the do it your self person.Sham."
2,"Shoddy assembly, cheesy parts","Not happy with this purchase at all. Seems to be a lot of variance in the units. I looked at a unit built some years ago, and had a chance to work with it, and it was a dream. Smooth, quiet operation, solid construction, precise, clean fit among parts.When I received mine, the fan cover had slipped, shearing off the screws that hold it in place. Amazon was excellent in getting a new one to me.The new one works as well as can be expected, but is extremely disappointing. The assembly and stop set to keep things in square is cheap and has excessive play. The milling on the mini table was miserable -- obvious quality control problems. I had to machine the table down myself. (I chose to do this rather than getting another unit shipped out.)I finally have a machine that works fairly well, but I had to put in a lot of effort and time to get it to that point. I would suggest carefully examining all other options before purchasing this Delta Disc Sander.Happy shop time...."
4,Pimpernel Gold: a great read at any age.,"I first read the Pimpernel Gold during middle-school, and then again in college. While it's prose at best is simple enough for a middle-schooler, the story is impossible to put down at any age.This true story has everything: evil Nazi's, a train full of royal gold, a young officer charged with shipping the gold out of occupied Norway, partisans hiding from the Gestapho, lovers separated by war, and plenty of near-escapes.If ever there was a WWII story worthy of a movie screen-play, this is it!"
1,Too many typos/mistakes,"As an introductory book to PLCs, this book is terrible. There are too many mistakes and typos. Since I don't have a lot of experience in this field, I wasted many hours trying to figure out why my instructions didn't work the way described in the book. People with PLC experience can probably figure out mistakes in the book, but newcomers will have a hard time following the instructions in this book. The sentence structure is also needlessly convoluted, as if the author is trying to sound smarter than he is. I feel sorry for the students who shelled out $180 for this book at their college bookstore."
2,Introduction to Programmable Logic Controllers,This book was more than worn and had extensive ink written notes through the whole book. Chapter questions had been answered.
4,"They're Only Human, After All","""Fallen"", Daivd Maine's newest work of fiction, illuminates the reader with a powerful and in-depth interpretation of the Bible's account of the first family. He thoroughly explores the psychology of the emotions that drove Adam, Eve, Cain, and Abel, revealing them for what they are, the basis for all humankind. He begins the novel at ""the end"" and slowly unravels the mysteries behind their motives as each chapter progresses toward ""the beginning."" This book satisfies the curiosity of anyone who has ever wondered ""why"" with regards to the story of the first family of dysfunction and the original fall from grace."
5,Quirkly and memorable.,"A dazzling Kate Beckinsale leads the cast in this bizarre and quirkly comedy about the Starkladder family. This movie captures your attention from the start and Schlesinger keeps the film on track. The film is amusing, but the true genius in it is the comedic but honest study of the human condition. Beckinsale is the perfect good-natured luftmensch and meddler and I loved what should be a classic line of ""I saw something nasty in the woodshed!"". The matriarchal contraints on the family was a riot to behold. This film can also be a lesson on how to deal with subtle verbal threats to your psyche and how perfectly far dismissiveness can go. At any rate, it's a clever and feel-good piece of fun which is always a good reason to see a film, I'd say."
4,Cold Comfort Farm,Excellent comedy with many unusual twists from the myriad of odd characters exhibiting strange behavior which makes the viewer view itself in a mirror!
3,Dull,Amazon.com recommended that I watch this movie because I like I Capture the Castle. Amazon could not have been more wrong. It was so dull that I didn't even finish the DVD. I hope the book is more ingenious than this.
2,"well, I suppose it was meant to be funny","Bad writing, bad acting, one cliche after another. It takes a very clever writer to satirize bad writing, and very good actors to satirize bad acting. These folks weren't able to carry it off. Too bad, I really like Joanna Lumley and she didn't have much scope in this program. Well, it wasn't all that bad, but I wouldn't recommend that anyone actually buy it."
3,The DVD could definatly have done better...,"I loved this movie, and the whole plot of it. When I purchased the DVD, I expected it to have in depth views of the psychological aspects of many of the characters, and why they were used. Basically the only really interesting thing in the entire DVD was the filming of it. The reason that I gave it 3 stars intead of 2 or even 1 is because of one feature that is hardly mentioned. How to make the bubblegum wrapper chains that she makes to quit smoking! But when it comes down to it, its a shame that they spoiled the awsome movie with such a poor DVD."
2,Too Predictable,"Sandra Bullock gets into a car accident, is sentenced to 28 days in rehab, goes to rehab, everyone hates her, she might get kicked out, then everyone loves her and she leaves rehab all happy and her problems are long gone. This formula is so predictable, yet so wrong. This movie tries to add a few laughs with a gay character, but I don't think this is the type of movie that should be generating any kind of laughs. I didn't like this movie from the start and ended up laughing at it instead of walking away from it knowing that I've learned something."
5,Sandra Bullock Shines!!!,"First of all, this movie should definitely be seen by anyone who loves great acting by a fantastic leading actress and love gripping dramas that really take your heart. Sandra Bullock shines as a woman who crashes her sister's limo from her wedding into a residential house and has to spend 28 days in rehab where she tries to find the person she really is behind her alcoholism. Throughout the movie, she lights up the screen with her dynamic acting mixed with some humor that would make this film a must see for any sandra fan or people who love a good drama with heart!"
4,The Revolving Door?,"I like this film, which can be a cleaner version of drug and alcohol addiction. Sandra Bullock and Viggo Mortensen are terrific but the film can be unrealistic regarding drugs and alcohol and becoming clean in 28 days. It follows the AA model and clearly a ""white"" addiction and fails to address the revolving door that any addiction can resume and lacks the prostitution aspect. However, the film displays usual facets of addiction recovery which can be relationship development, sabotage and a lack of the impact with family system development by only blaming the addict, and not addressing the vital forces of trauma, mental illness and co-dependency with addiction."
3,nice movie....,nice movie worth a watch...sandra is charming as usual.i liked the last part of the film where the guy goes to the shop to replace dead plant
5,great...,"WHOA! all the great ones are here! Astro zombie's, skulls, vampira, braineaters...and all tha rest! ..this one is great!"
5,Why can't we have some guts?,"The Misfits are probably the greatest punk band of all time. If not for the Ramones I could say that more definatively, but as it is I struggle between which of the two is better. However, I will say that the Misfits are one of the greatest bands I've ever heard and that I can listen to these short little punk songs over and over.This CD is probably the Misfits' best (though Static Age is definately up there). It has everything you could want from the Misfits...a little pop, a lot of punk, and a lot of horror business. Danzig's voice is perfectly balanced between ghoulish wailing, screaming, and Elvis-impersonating. Stand-out tracks include...every one of them. However, forced to choose I would pick ""20 Eyes,"" ""Vampira,"" ""Astro Zombies,"" and ""Hatebreeders."" I would say that this is one of the greatest punk records to ever be released and any Misfits fan OR punk fan of any sort would be amiss not to own it."
3,Misfits,"Alright, since i first heard them, ive been addicted to the misfits. I had some collections and Earth AD, but then i bought this one with static age. jesus, you guys are gonna hate me for this, but it sucked compared to static age. Both rocked (thats a given considering its a misfits album) but i just never really got into this album like i did static age or earth ad. Yeah rock on"
5,Classic Misfits,"Great cd, first listened to it on a crapped-up tape, but finally bought it... great stuff. Not political, like I usually like my punk rawk, but catchy as hell and gritty. What can I say, its good stuff. 20 eyes, of course, is a classic, as well as Nike a go-go, and I turned into a Martian. And you gotta love the live version of Mommy Can I go Out and Kill Tonight. The Misfits get a little repetitive and old without Danzig later on, but this album is the best. Buy it."
5,Like all the Misfits albums... its classic.,Probably the greatest band of low-brow punk. This is the most pop sounding of the guys' albums which is not a bad thing because Danzig's voice is very clean sounding here. Probably the best song these guys have done is 'Skulls' in which Danzig does some excellent wailing. Some of the lyrics are really sick when you actually listen to them but its so hard to notice that because the music sounds so upbeat and catchy.
1,Double-Sided but Half-Baked,"This product fairly reeks of the ""rush to release"" syndrome. The instruction manual comes with several separate ""Errata"" sheets attached, correcting misinformation inadvertently printed in the manual. If you use this scanner, you can't have any drivers for any other Visioneer scanners on your computer, which is frankly ridiculous -- for a scanner that costs $1000, you'd think the software engineers could devise a driver that doesn't cause such problems, especially since many people own more than one scanner. What's worse, they're not kidding -- I uninstalled the Documate driver and returned the scanner for a refund, but I still can't get my other scanners to work, because the Documate software screwed them up. This scanner is way too much trouble for the money. I wish I'd never heard of it.Update -- 4/2005 -- if you're looking for a duplex scanner, you're better off with the Fujitsu FI-4120C2. I found it, and it's excellent."
4,Murmuring Judges review,"I am studying this play for A level and I have found it quite interesting, although there are a couple of ways in which I would criticise it. I find that David Hare's style leaves too little to the imagination, everything is made explicitly clear, and, although this is good in some ways, in others it is a little bland. I think, however that to fully appreciate such a play it needs to be performed, because that is what it is written for. I also find the ending a little unsubstantial, although I thik it is meant to be so, to keep the reader guessing and to allow them to have a little imagination. Overall, it is good play and t makes a hard hitting statement about the quality and state of our legal and policing system which is far from perfect."
4,Gateway to the Backroads,"This is a guide to 21 road trips in California and 4 in Nevada. I've now taken a number of the backroads described in this book. There are some excellent suggestions for getting away from the interstates and finding the true character of these two states. The Martin's have a folksy style that I enjoyed. They didn't include much info about the scenery in between but mainly rundowns of the main cities along the way and places to eat and sleep. They really keep to the basics here. For example the section on ""The Silver Trail"" from Las Vegas to Virginia city is only 14 pages for a trip covering 443 miles. This book is a good starting point to get ideas for road excursions, but if you're going to spend any length of time on one of these trips I'd recommend getting further material before setting out."
3,Too small for everyday use,No room to add today's big sunglasses and/or anything else. Becare of eh measurments provided on teh Amazon webpage for Bagallinin bags - those measurements are for the shipping envelope.Otherwise it's very well made with lots of slots for cards and zippered pockets for small flat items. The colour is nice too -sage with the orange interior.
5,Ms. Mary is a dude,"You know that Ms. Mary lady that wrote the review below this one? Well guess what, she's a dude. That's right, Ms. Mary is a dude. A dude named Ryan Moore. This is his friend, John Toohey. You know all the other reviews for this album? They're all written by Ryan Moore, Jeb H., And myself. Now that the conspiracy has been blown open, you all can go back to living normal lives. And by the way, if amazon doesn't approve of any of the reviews that my and I friends wrote, they should know that we live in Silver City New Mexico. Now if you will excuse me, i must go back to grooming my pet rock."
5,"Authentic, clear and delicious.","I am Lebanese and this book IS the book. If you want one book...buy this one. Well displayed, described, delicious and genuine Lebanese food."
2,A Disappointment For Die-Hard Haggard Fans,"I love Sony/Legacy's ""Essential"" series and was really looking forward to the day they released an Essential Merle Haggard. That day has come and I am very disappointed. Granted, Haggard wasn't with Epic for very long, but this collection seems to be lacking a number of songs that could've been included (""Natural High"" for one). I was expecting a double disc, remastered and loaded with Merle's Epic hits (heck, they don't all have to be hits, either!). This sad little collection is good for the remastered sound, but little else for die-hard fans."
1,NOT HAPPY,"I'm sorry, but I was NOT happy with this mascara purchase. I usually buy Yves Saint Laurent mascara all the time. Perhaps I received a bad tube or an old tube? But the mascara was old and DRY. I was not able to use it. I was VERY upset that I spent $30 for mascara and can not use it. I am going to try to return this. This was awful to me."
4,great product,"This is a great product. well made I think, plus it arrived before I had anticipated the arrival. I was also well packaged."
4,"Easy, cheap and does the job!",I have several other small pocket and kitchen sharpeners but this one does the job on my pocket knives very well. I have tried other types but I get better results with this one. I don't know much about sharpening but I do get some sharp blades.
4,ONE FAULT,great little sharpener the only fault i see is the designof the endcap holding the sticks in the block just a piece of wood spinning on a woodscrew flimsy but it works poor design in my opinion but it sharpens really good easy too use as i only have use of my right hand R. Ramsden PTC. GA
4,Fun games at a great price.,"I got this as a gift for my girlfriend, who had tried the demo's and really liked them. This is a great buy and is almost guaranteed fun for any and everyone!"
1,Scandalous !!,"Hi,I just receive one of this bottle for my wife who used to have it for more than 10 years and .....like another say cooking oil !!!All the bottle and the perfume itself are false !I'm going to ask for my cash back but it's look like a good working affair for them.New bottles arrive time by time (at my time, there were only 2 now 5 more !)From where, Dior doesn't produce anymore this fragrance.Forget the idea to retreve this marvellous fragrance....not from this vendorKeep away !"
1,Don't buy this product!,"Not only is the software abysmal, GeoDiscovery accepts your return, but will neither provide the promiced refund nor reply to your communications. Their 'phone numbers go unanswered and unattended, I guess because they are unable to support a staff, never mind provide refunds."
1,DO NOT BUY A GEODE!!,"This product is essentially still in beta testing and you will just be paying to help them test it.Also, currently (as of June '01) the company is having financial troubles and their future is suspect.Don't waste your money!"
5,a great four seasons cd,Simon Standage has been a leading violinist for the English Concert for some time. Now he is independent and records with Chandos. Nowhere more he appears scarily demonic then here in Vivaldi's Four Seasons. I actually discovered this cd much later from other Archiv cds (with Pinnock): to my surprise it proved the best version as I could hear the violinist under the shadow of excellent Pinnock wonderfully conscious of his presence. Pinnock and the English Concert-as always-conveys the unerring sense of vitality somewhat different from Hogwood's. Early digital recording nevertheless sounds better with the authentic instruments. I really highly recommend this cd not only to Vivaldi-Pinnock fans but to anyone who are interested in Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
5,be good to your knives,"it's no fun to cook with dull knives, but most sharpening devices take off to much steel. This fine-grained alumina rod keeps your edge keen and aligned while minimizing the need to go back to the flat stone."
2,"Lansky 8"" Ceramic Sharp Stick","I bought three of these - two as kitchen gifts. These are like little toy things, and will break. If you need this sort of thing, look at Messermeister brand. For about U$25 you can get a real ceramic sharpener."
2,"Don't waist your money, this thing doesn't last","I bought this abou a year ago, and used it about one per month. After about 3-4 months of use, the surface of the stick became completely flat and no sharpening material left for sharpening the knife. I have to throw this away. If you want something that will last more than three month you should go with more expensive but better equipped one though price may be higher but you have to think about 3-4 months usage with $20 or much longer life with more price."
5,Nice sharpener,This ceramic sharpener is the first one I have owned. You can really tell that it sharpens a blade although my own skills in finding the right angle is very great.
4,Pressure Washer Alternative,"I came close to buying this model at BJ. The price was good and the quality seemed ok. However I found a different one at Lowes for $279 built by Troy-Bilt. It it rated at 2550 PSI, has the Briggs and Stratton engine 6.75 and works really well. It came with 3 tips and runs like a charm. Lowes also carry the exact same model with a Honda engine for $20 more or refurbished 3000 psi washers for $199. For some reason Lowes does not show their pressure washers online so you'll have to make a trip to the store to see what they have.All the models I was interested in have the extra clear hose dip to suck from detergent bottles, but none of the models offered a valve to control the flow of the soap. I found a small plastic valve at Lowes in the plumbing dept that I will be able to insert in the feeding line to solve this problem.Happy cleaning."
1,Not what I expected.,"The scanning specifications of the Umax Astra e5470 seem appealing. I chose this unit because of the indicated resolution, built-in transparency adapter, and reasonable price. I was not impressed.I spent a long day experimenting with this scanner, and I found that both reflective and transparency scans always come out blurry, even without cropping and/or enlarging the image. The result of scanning a photograph is dissatisfying, and the result of scanning a transparency is simply unacceptable. Scanned transparencies come out unclear and without true color, plus there are always disturbing lines down the middle of the scanned image because the transparency light reads and records imagery from the internal scanner parts which are located right underneath the area where it is necessary to place a negative/transparency. Aside from this, the included software is not good. I returned the scanner after one day of throughly frustrating use."
3,Too small,"Love these shoes but were way too small. Usually am a size 10, ordered a size ten, they could barely fit my sister with size 9 feet. They are also pretty narrow as well. They seem comfortable but unfortunately they don't have them in an 11 so I'll have to return them completely."
5,Fluffffffyyyyyyyy!,"If you're in the market for sheepskin boots and are actually looking at reviews...go ahead and save yourself some time and just buy Uggs.Are there other brands that make sheepskin/shearling boots? Yes. Are they as good as Uggs? No.I've tried many brands, and I still end up going back to Uggs for all my longterm use boots. I bought these for my wife because she continued to steal MY ugg indoor slippers and I wanted them back. Let it be known that she had been, until recently, an ""Uggs hater""...casually tossing them aside as a trendy item. But after using my slides and men's tall boots around the house, she's just as sold as I have always been. They're comfortable, firm yet supple, and EXCEEDINGLY fluffy and soft. Very warm and comfortable. I'm writing this in early February...Valentine's Day is coming up folks, if you're at a loss for ideas, don't hesitate. Buy."
2,warm but little else,These are the least comfortable slippers I have ever had. There is no padding in the foot bed and a single skimpy layer of shearling. Also no arch support. They keep my toes warm but that's it. Now I usually revert to socks and a pair of Birkenstocks instead of wearing these UGG slippers.
3,Spooky UK,"Spooky An Ending Is My choice. The other songs are nice, but An Ending is the Best style and best from Spooky."
4,Great Speakers,Installed easy and they sound great. I dont have an amp to push them to their full potential but they sound really good. Descent bass for the price. Overall great speaker. Awesome mids and highs. As long as you adjust your settings on your stereo you can make these sounds awesome.
5,Pure win.,"I put a set of 4 of these in my wifes aveo a year ago and they are still alive and pounding just as crisp as ever, I just bought a set of 6.5s and 6x9s for my s10 blazer and they are also amazing quality they look great have 9.5/10 lows 10/10 mids and highs you will be nothing but pleased. They come with foam gaskets that are really nice makes alot better seal, adapter rings to fit to a variation of vehicles, mounting hardware, and a really nice set of grilles. Buy them dont look at anything else just buy these lol. You wont get better for the price Ive heard some really really high end 150$ a pair type speakers that were slightly better but not by far."
4,Good speakers,"These are pretty good speakers. They aren't the best I've ever heard, but you get some seriously good sound for the price. I didn't drive the Prelude for a while, and when I got back in and turned these things on, I was surprised by how much better they sound than my truck's stock speakers."
5,these are IT !!!!!,Just installed these today in my 1990 4runner in the front doors and bought speaker spacers wich were not required. Hooked them up to a orion cobalt 600.4 amp wow these things bump!! Ive read some reviews saying they have no bass thats crazy! These little things got a lot of bass plus highs and mids! Maybe the past reviewers were not putting enogh power to them. I also have a new pair of boston acoustic 6/9 these things blow them out of the water in every way! So time to get rid of those and get another pair of these! Get these you will be happy!! Cant wait to hear how they sound in a month after a full break in period!!Update Sep 29 09 Just had another pair installed in the back and all I have to say is WOW!! Like I said before I had Boston Acoustic 6/9 s95 in boxes and they just cannot hang with these! You can get away without a sub with these! Love em!
4,G-Unit,"Put (4) of these speakers in my G-35 sedan... What a BIG improvement over the factory gear.. Clean highs and much richer & deeper lows. Can't believe my Infiniti factory speakers were ""Paper"".I also put (min amount) Dynamat behind the doors for better sound insulation.Overall I wish I had done this much sooner... The sound is clean and richer. I have No amp or sub (Not a Boom Box). I just want clean, richer sound, on a budget... Nice pick.."
3,It said it would fit!,"The specs stated it would fit my 2000 Honda civic, but nooo. The old speakers had 3 holes and these speakers have 4. rrrrrr / Sound quality was ok / no basejeff"
1,not happy- on way back,"I bought these after reading all the positive reviews and based on my own limited experience, which was largely positive.first out of the box I was peeved to see 2 separate sized quick release terminal posts, one of which was a 22ga and of course not included. It took about an hour of driving around to find a place that sold them (autozone) but of course they didn't have just a box of 22ga connects, I had to purchase a whole assorted kit for 10 bucks. (so add 20 bucks to the purchase price b/t gas and connector cost.)I don't recommend these for jeep sound bar application. I don't think they were engineered for the stress of the upside down mount in a jeep. Within 1 week of installation, the capacitor wire lead broke free from the terminal post (it was weakly soldered.) I re-soldered it but it did it again less than 2 days later.when the speakers are up and running they sound great. they just never are. sending back"
5,Kick A** speakers,"I recently purchased a wakeboard tower for a 2001 Glastron GX205 and these were the speakers that came on the tower so I decided to swap out two Sony speakers I had in the bow with these so they would all match. The two in the tower are hooked directly to an amp running full range and 150w each, and the other two are are wired to the head unit which is probably running around 50w peak and the sound that they put out is amazing. You can really crank these and the bass they put out is unbelieveable. I would highly recommend these speakers."
5,Yes!,"These speakers are simply stunning. I've had many cars and have installed many stereo systems and I have to say these Polk's are probably the best sounding speakers I've ever heard. The sound is well balanced, crisp highs - not too harsh and good tight bass and midrange. After dialing these baby's in, now their smooth as silk."
2,Horrid bass,"Replaced four door speakers in a 2009 Nissan Murano using the stock head unit. The bass is very muddled and can not be adjusted via the bass and treble settings on the unit. Added a 50 watt/channel Alpine amp. They sound better on the highs, but are very bright and the treble needs to be turned down for most music. The bass is still horrible. There is no low end clarity at all, just a low droning sound (listening to radio personalities with low voices is unbearable and the bass has to be turned almost as low as possible, music requires adjustment for almost every song). I rechecked the wiring, thinking I did not install them properly, but all is wired correctly. I am considering reinstalling the OEM speakers (while keeping the amp) as they produced overall better sound."
4,A tactical wargamers game,"If you're looking for an action packed, shoot'em up, blow'em up sort of game, then look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a war game that is challenging, very strategic, and engrossing and takes a little thought. Try RSG.Rising Sun Gold really is a good game. It is a little old and the graphics aren't quite like today's graphics, but I still love sitting down for an hour or two on a day off or on a rainy day marching around in Burma or hiding in thick Jungle waiting for a Japanese Rifle Platoon to ambush."
2,Horrid Smell,"Don't get me wrong, axe is generally a solid brand. Most of its products are pretty good and are worth using, but not the shower gel. This stuff doesn't actually clean your body like a body wash will, and while it has the axe scent of its corresponding body spray type, the smell wears off after 3 minutes, and not because your nose gets used to your fragrance, it never happens that quickly! Furthermore, 'Unlimited' is easily the worst axe scent, it smells like a cross between a sweating fish, a pomegranite, and an eye clinic. Stay away from this, just use some soap or body wash to keep your skin clean in the shower, and keep your axe collection strictly restricted to the body spray and/or dry deodorent."
5,"I Love, Love, Love this product","This bike is wonderful, worth every penny. There are several pre set programs and you can also personalize your own. Also when using the bike there is NO NOISE!!!! I highly recommend this bike"
1,poor,I received mine and the Santa was broke. I could return it but the kids already seen the darn thing and its now only on ebay for more money. Looking at the santa these are really not toys for kids to play with only for them to look at. The santa was in 6 different pieces in the packaging that shows me how easy they break. I paid 30 for it and I agree its worth a lot less than that. They are so tiny would be very easy to lose or break. If its for kids to play with skip it bc I don't see these lasting that long.
1,Rubbish purchase!,"The price is too expensive for small dolls,was a general disappointment, because evilcan play with them. Rubbish purchase!"
4,Good value,I needed a replacement after a deer got in our way and this was it price for value fit and finish I would give 4 1/2 stars.
2,Period abrasion,"I generally prefer hearing Bach on period instruments but this set of Brandenburgs 4-6 is pretty abrasive at times and recording emphasizes this. The violin solo in the last movement of No. 4 is unbelievably scratchy. I used to own this disc but have since replaced it with Tafelmusik's complete set, which is cut from pretty much the same cloth as Pinnock's but is more musically relaxed and easier on the ears too. Since this Pinnock's set was made, period instrument work has advanced a long way so this now is swamped by he competition."
4,Nice saw,"Just bought one a month ago. I did not have any adjustment problems (as mentioned in another review). The saw cuts well, the variable speed is great; overall a lot of fun to work with! The one gripe I have is that the whole thing is rather noisy. In particular, you better make sure you have a very solid table to mount it on, or your whole shop will start to hum in sync with the saw! Dunno whether other scroll saws are better or worse."
5,Great tool,This is one of my favorite portable powertools in my collection works great for junk yard trips and working on farm machinery.
4,A Friend of Mine Recommended and I love her for it,"A friend of mine recommended this book to me and I am so glad she did. A sweet and entertaining read that dipped into the more important parts of a young man's life. I loved Moehringer's moments of clarity that he disperses throughout the text - moments he remembers with ""the men"" that he knows shaped the man he was to become. Never overly sentimental but clearly emotional in a practical, thankful, respectful way. Well done."
2,Slow Moving but Interesting,"I am enjoying this book, as I grew up on Long Island at the same time as the author. The book is moving a little slowly though. I usually look forward to each evening when I can read a book to catch up on the next movement of the character. I feel that this character spends too much time in one place."
5,JR pulled me in,"I bought this book at the Goodwill store because it looked interesting. JR pulled me in with his story and style of writing. I was reading it in the Allentown, PA airport on my way back home to Atlanta and a youngish man came up to me and asked if I liked the book and said that JR is a friend of his. He said JR now lives in Las Vegas and is planning a biography of Andre Agassi. I will read anything he writes!! And I will read The Tender Bar again."
3,Good book,"This book is really good if you come from Long Island and grew up on the North Shore. He mentions so many places I know, it's kind of cool. The book is a little slow and hard to get through but worth it. A friend recommended the book to me and I do like it. I bought it for other friends but haven't heard if they like it or not. But very good, not great but worth a read."
5,A Milestone on my own Plandome Road,"Whew. Finally finished this outstanding memoir after about two weeks of savoring a few chapters a night. I haven't laughed or cried so hard in a long time. Moehringer's descriptions of Grandpa and the Shit House are hilarious. The book is a wicked good combination of the high brow, the middle brow, and the low brow, and how to make a meaningful stew from these is JR's artful gift. Highly recommended, especially for those who grew up without a father, or those with a fondness for or aspiration to elite American universities. As JR points out, it ain't so much the gettin' in--which of course one needs--it's the gettin' through that takes a village. And a place like Publicans."
4,The Tender Bar,A comimg of age story from the point of view of a young man with an absentee father. Great little book with vivid character descriptions. Just enough twists and turns to hold my interest through to the end.
2,Disappointed,"Having read Sutton by J.R. Moehringer, I was looking forward to his earlier work, a memoir entitled The Tender Bar. Unfortunately the book failed to download properly and I've been unable to read it. I hope to obtain a legible copy because he is an excellent writer!"
3,huh?,"oh boy had i heard great things about X! the best ever band out of LA (as opposed to nofx..?)!!! then i got the cd, and boy was it boring. maybe if john doe had done all the vocals...i don't know, it's just really hard to listen to in one sitting."
1,Bad isn't a good enough word,"I used to be of the opinion that Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo was in fact The Worst Movie Ever, but after having seen Party Animalz, my opinion has changed.I would like to say that as of now Party Animalz is the worst movie I have ever seen in the span on my life.Yes, worse than Troll 2, worse than Gigli, and yes...even more horrible than Pearl Harbor. Watch with caution."
5,Outstanding bag!,"Really. Outstanding. A zillion places to put things. It's adaptable, it's handsome, and a great buy. My husband loves it, and thinks I spent three times as much."
5,A wonderful metaphor for cross-cultural couples,"I first came across ""Frog In Love"" as a pre-school teacher. I was asked to read it for our Valentines Day celebration. I was deeply touched by Max Velthuijs's amazing ability to tenderly convey such a hopeful message that both young children, as well as adults can grasp easily. My husband and I were very much like frog and duck when we were good friends. Ironically, just as frog meets with an accident, so did my husband and just like duck, I was able to help him and we admitted our deep affection for eachother. Naturally I went and bought the story for my husband and read it to him. When I got to the last page, and read the words ""Love knows no boundaries"" we both had tears in our eyes. Someday when we have our children, we'll read this lovely story to them!"
2,NBC doesn't show up for the competition,"""Real"" wrestling is scarecly ever televised so my expectations of the Olympics were extremely high. After that bubble burst with minimal air-time, I was excited to hear that NBC would ship special tapes for these events. So I headed for Amazon.com to find my copy and it arrived today. Unless your thirst for ""real"" wrestling is so strong that anything is better than nothing, don't bother. They skim through a few matches in freestyle, with end up only focusing on maybe 3~4 matches. Yeah, my son wrestles, and maybe I'm looking for anything to give him an edge but NBC really wins the $$gold$$ here."
1,Can you give less than one star?,"This game is the biggest waste of time and hard drive space EVER. I'm not kidding. Skip this game, you will be sorry if you don't."
5,This Book will point you in the right direction !,"Leadership is a characteristic which is a key ingredient to obtaining success in today's society. Unfortunately, it is not something we are all born with. This book, however, will point you in the right direction to becoming a leader. It is very well written, clear, and easy to understand. Leadership From Within by Peter Urs Bender is definitely something I recommend to everyone!"
5,WOW,"I loved Material World. It is fascinating to see how others live. Although many of the belongings seem to be very limited in 3rd world countries, it is interesting to see cherished items that look like they have been with families for years. I saw a review that said the only purpose of the book was to shame Americans for their wealth. I like to think that this book reminds us of the blessings we have and our obligation to help those in need. Most critical however is to see how others live and the things that they value in their lives. It is sad that someone would be so critical of this book when it gives such insight into others' lives. As I said above, I love this book and the message that it gives."
5,Beautiful and informative,"An incredible piece of journalism and photography. It puts into perspective daily life around the world as well as the ""stuff"" we cherish."
5,Rated 5 stars= 4 paws and 1 tail,"I have 2 mini chihuahuas, and we all know how nervous they can be. When I go to work, I turn the CD player on and let my darlings enjoy their music in solitude laying on my---or should I say ""their""---terry bath robe. There is definitely a difference in Sasha and Nuggie's temperment at the end of the day when they listen to this outstanding collection of soothing music. You won't go wrong buying this audio piece for a pet or for yourself.......It's very relaxing and easy to listen to."
4,relax,"my dogs do not react to the songs, but i enjoy them :) good songs for people to relax.i still play the cd when i am away even my dogs dont care."
4,While You Are Gone ~Music Pets Love,This has great music for your pets to listen to my dog Duke and my cat Simba and my bird Woodstock have to stay home al most every day because I have to go to work and study. Before I got this songs i worried that they might do some thing to the house when im gone so then i went on line to see if any thing would help my animals and I looked at this and listened to part of the songs online and they were good and my dog was looking up at the screen and all most fell a sleep it was funny but then i bought this and my anamls loved it all of them my dog cat and bird so evey time i live home and can trust them and every time i came home the house was the same as it was when i left so i think people should give thid thing a try it worked for my animals and i hope it can work for yours.
2,Music for pets,"Bought to help calm my dog from her separation anxiety. I know music helps but this did not help her, but then most things I've tried didn't help as much as getting another pet to keep her company."
5,Compelling style--reads like a novel,"Lucy Daniels has written a book that will inspire hope in all readers who struggle to master the trauma of childhood. She is a gifted, award-winning author, whose compelling style combines with stunning candor to make this book read like an intriguing novel. And yet this is her true life story --one of enormous courage, creativity, and ultimately redemption."
3,It's ok not really the best but ok,"Seems so so to me, nothing outstanding to honest, I think I will look for another CD on this and maybe I will enjoy it more. 3 stars because Classical is very subjective, you may love it."
4,Super smooth and slippery,This smoothing serum smells smells wonderful! I like the left over scent of it on my hands. I have wavy hair that gets frizzy with humidity. I usually put this product in my hair after a shower. Then I'll braid my hair and let it dry. When I release the braids my hair has soft smooth waves. My only complaint about this product is that it is flamable. I'm not sure if it's good to use it for ironing hair. I got the product on sale at JCPenny for $14 and I have been satisfied with it since.
5,The Right Choice (for Husband and Wife),"After the purchase of an extra-firm mattress that I love, but that made my wife miserable, I was under pressure to find a cushioned mattress pad to make the bed more comfortable. My attention first went to hotel-stye feather beds, but they apparently need constant fluffing. Since we don't have a hotel-style maid for that, I opted for the wool mattress pad and it's been a huge hit. Very comfortable. Stays fluffy for long periods. My wife now raves about her bed!"
5,Witty take on the intelligentsia,"Six Degrees of Separation transports us to upper-crust Manhattan and draws us into a rarefied world of art, intellectual conversations, and posh penthouses before turning this setting upside down and exposing its inherent hypocrocies. What could have been clumsy, heavy-handed satire is instead two hours of delightful repartee in which the characters relate an engrossing narrative about a young man who charmed his way into their world under false pretenses.Those who know Will Smith mainly as the Fresh Prince of Bel Air or one of the Men in Black are likely to be astounded at the depth of his acting talent. Additionally, Stockard Channing's Oscar-worthy performance leaves the viewer thinking about the movie long after it has ended.Unfortunately, the DVD version is skimpy on extra features. While it features the original trailer, interviews with the cast or more information about the true story that inspired the play would have been a major enhancement."
4,A truly intense film-Stockard Channing blows you away!,"If you arent prepared to sit down and watch this movie a few times to get the full effect, dont even bother! This film was so incredibly intense, and captivating-I must have watched it 6 times...Will Smith and Sutherland did very well in their roles, however the true star by far was Stockard Channing! She was very thorough and acted with emotions only SHE could pull off...really, is there anything that woman can not do? A must see-very pyschological...take your time with it!"
4,True breakout role for Smith,"Every actor who expects to have a long career does a breakout role. This is Will Smith's. He gives a stage worthy performance. Instead of getting more roles like this, he's played in action movies where he's charming and funny but not compelling.The real story revolves around Smith and Channing. Love the ending shot of her. Sutherland here is thrown in as a nice extra. Glad they resurrected Anthony Michael Hall because nobody could have played this part better in film. One of the best screen adaptation of a play."
3,Fair tool,Good for yard tools etc but not great on knives or in my situation a Cold Steel Gladius. You are not going to acheive a razor sharp edge using this so be aware if that is what you are looking for.
4,It does its job,"I mean what to say ? It is a low budget sharpening stone for axes,machetes,lawn mower blades etc. Easy to use if a bit dangerous. Just pay attention and go slow !"
5,Excellent cd,I was waiting in anticipation for this cd to arrive and was not disapointed. Etta is the best
5,Today's younger generation should hear this album.,"This is what people who truly appreciate good music refer to as ""R&B;"". On this classic set of tunes sung with the kind of power and conviction that many of today's young singers tend to shy away from (or just can't bring, lol), you get the RHYTHM and the BLUES in one devastating combination. Etta James is one of this country's unheralded treasures and everytime I listen to this album, I am reminded of how much we need true artists like her to keep good music from going bad. No serious music collection should be without this one because it IS essential.Note: also get Bobby ""Blue"" Bland's 'Two Steps From The Blues' and play it back-to-back with Etta James' 'At Last' for an R&B; listening experience like NO OTHER! By the way, are these two in the Hall of Fame, yet!?!?!?"
1,poor disc quality,I order this disc twice...both were listed as new. The first disc would not track properly in my auto CD player. Returned the first and recieved the replacment...same problem with first. Will not track properly in the car CD player. I burnt the disc onto a generic CD-R and it works fine. I've been told that occasionally music labels will use less than quality material and have results similar to mine. too bad considering the cost of quality CD's today. No reason to cut corners.
5,Wow,"I ordered this CD from Amazon the day after hearing of Ms. James' recent death, something I had been meaning to do for, well, years. A short time after her passing, the death of another singer with, er, celebrity status occurred, and there was much public ballyhooing of the wasted talent, the great voice, yada, yada. Well, many are called and few are chosen. Lots of people have a voice; hardly anyone is able to make as much use of one's voice as Etta James did. News of the loss of this woman who had an amazing voice and an amazing career may have been eclipsed by other news, but her talent was not eclipsed by anyone's. For instruction on just how it is that singing gets done, and in how many ways, buy this CD. Buy it now. There is a singing lesson in every note."
2,Design of the pitcher,"After reading reviews, I did purchase the Kitchen Aid Blender. While I did not return this item, I found the overall design disappointing. The actual mechanism (blending) is very good; however, the design of the pitcher is questionable. The pitcher design wraps the blender and I feel I must be very careful not the chip or the break the plastic overall pitcher. I feel this blender must be used in a very careful manner or else !@#$"
3,A little less noise please!,"This blender does a good job overall. My only pet peeve is that I've read other reviews and they said that it wasn't noisy. Well, in my opinion it's fairly noisy. My guess is that it's due to the Polycarb jar that it comes with. I had $50 Krups blender with a glass Jar before this one and it wasn't as loud. If you plan on using the ""liquefy"" setting a lot I would invest in a pair of ear plugs."
1,Expected more,"My last blender cost less than half of this one. It wasn't the best blender, but it held up to heavy use for many years before I decided to upgrade to the KitchenAid. Big mistake. The motor on the first one I received smoked terribly, and had to be returned. The second one did indeed blend more smoothly, quietly and quickly than my cheaper model, but my happiness didn't last. After maybe three months I removed the jar from the dishwasher and noticed it was cracking all over. I continued to use it, and only washed it by hand after that, but within a couple more months it began leaking and had to be replaced. At this point, the motor had also begun smoking badly and the unit had become very noisy when I ran it. I considered buying a new jar, but frankly by that point, I had just had enough. Total waste of money."
2,Unhappy,"I bought this blender in September 2009 and thought a $100+ blender would last longer than this! After a year of light use, the blender pitcher began to leak and was really difficult to tighten. It never did stop leaking entirely. It's a different design than most blenders with a removable base and gasket. At first I really liked that, but the design of the pitcher means you can't wash it in a dishwasher without having 2-3"" of water collect in its recessed underside. Still, I was fairly happy until this morning when I put together a smoothie, pressed the button, and got a whizzing sound with no movement of the blender blades. Inspecting the base of the blender until revealed that the plastic part that engages the plastic covered nut at the base of the pitcher was fried. I mean fried--it looked almost melted. Of course, it's out of warranty and now I'm in the market for another blender....."
4,Great smoothie machine,"It is amazing how this thing crushes ice into a smoothie. Push ice crush and the blender automatically pulses then stops, then pulses, and stops, and turns my ice, fruit, yogurt and milk into a creamy milkshake consistency. The brushed nickel also looks great and the wide mouth jar feels solid and is easy to clean....Update after two months of use, the bottom of the jar where the blade is coupled is leaking. I called Kitchen Aid and provided a model and serial number and they are sending a replacement part. I read about this problem from other reviews; I wonder if there is some design or manufacturing defect with the one-piece pitcher design."
2,Disappointing,"I do not understand what exactly was the thought behind this performance. The tempi are all displaced, they sound either rushed or sluggish. There is no motivation or expression in the sound of either the choir or the soloists and the Kyrie is just awful! I have never heard such disjointed and pretentious phrasing. There is no feeling for the style nor the words! I'm a professional musician so I know a thing or two, and I would not recommend this recording to anyone."
2,Allergy,"My 4 year old love it for the 1st couple days, then rash begin on her waist and she refuse to wear.... need to replace back to underjams."
3,Clive Nolan is a keyboard god...,"...but ever since Paul Wrightson left the band, Arena has stumbled. Their last great opus was THE VISITOR which is a classic neo-prog album. To truly hear what Clive's keys are capable of and to truly hear the best neo-prog in the world, bar none, check out Pendragon...especially their last 3 albums. IQ is a close second in the genre. I'd place the current Arena behind both bands in a contest and probably add Porcupine Tree above them too...if you want to call PT ""neo-prog."""
3,"Easy to use, waiting for results",I just got mine and thought I'd give first impressions. Bought it for powdery mildew on my bushes. I mixed it one tablespoon per gallon of water and used a sprayer. All standard stuff. The product does have a light citrus fragrance and the one Reviewer who said it has a strong scent must have used a much higher concentration or didn't dilute it. It sprays clear and we'll see if it works. Instructions say respray every seven days until condition clears. The pint size makes 16 gallons.
5,Great Puzzles!! Another timeless classic...,"My children, ages 3, 4, and 10, loved playing with these puzzles at our pediatrician's office so much, it was difficult to get them to leave. When we found this set on Amazon.com, we purchased them immediately.Each puzzle comes with a plastic tray, a full-size black and white photo with the outlines of each shape, and a one-piece foam frame for the outside edges. Smaller children can put the puzzle together right over top of the black and white photo, making the puzzles simple enough for toddlers to assemble on their own. Older children can put the puzzles together without using the photo as a backdrop, making the puzzles a little more challenging as they grow."
5,own 'em all!!!!,"Oh, just buy it! This is a great listen over and over. You can, pretty much, piece together the 'rare cult"" if you shop wisely. This is part of the "" rare cult"" tracks."
2,cheap,cheap product and uncertain attachment. It also rattles on the spoke and only has a secure attachment surface in one spot. Won't use for long.
2,"33pgs are OK, The rest is just a reference","If you want a basic idea of what you need to do to get your kid into a school and some basics, this is not a bad book. The first 33 pages has some good information but its only 33 pages. This information is likely available elsewhere on the internet. I give this 4 stars for the first 33 pages and 2 stars for the rest.The rest of the book is a listing of schools and information on them. There is nothing in the listing that will give you rankings of the school nor recommendation so its just a reference and a list of all the schools. Most if not all the info you can get of the net but it is nice to have it all in one place so finding all the school online becomes easier. Worth $5-7 so get it used.This book is much better than the 13th ed of Independant school guide. The format is much better and easier to read and the front pages are better."
4,Better,"I actually had stopped watching this show when Grissom left as the only other character I really liked was Warwick Brown. I'm a fan of Laurence Fishburne but wasn't enamored when his character joined the show (the character seemed a little too gloomy for a weekly show). At any rate, I decided to give Ted Danson (D.B.) a shot and was pleasantly surprised. His character is slightly offbeat, like Grissom, but in a very different way. It actually spurred me to go back and watch the seasons with Langston and I found them to be better than I had anticipated. Langston was still a tad bit bleak, but not as much as I expected. I was glad to see Catherine go, so that also made this season better."
1,"good idea, bad product","I decided it was time to upgrade both my cable modem and my wireless router. I've generally had good luck with Linksys products in the past, and saw the wcg200 as compatable with Cox Comm broadband service. I've had some problems with dropped cable connections as mentioned, but I've had serious problems with the wireless, using every form of encryption. The wireless connections will randomly drop, then will refuse to correctly connect, despite the fact that nothing has changed. Then after hours/days of wasted time, the connections magically work again.I've had it with this piece of junk. I'm switching to separate modem/router devices, and this may be the last Linksys product I ever buy."
4,Great...except for one thing!,"The instructions suggest this will be an easy install: Hook it up, call your cable company to give them the MAC address of the modem, and you'll be all set.That would have worked, except the sticker on the bottom of the modem had the wrong MAC address! I only discovered it after three hours of trying to configure, re-configure, turning firewalls on and off, and rebooting the modem and the computer. Once I noticed the correct number in the modem's set up screen, I called the cable company back, and was going in two minutes.Once running, this is fine. It combines the modem and wireless-g into one unit, and unlike other Linksys products, actually has an on/off switch to allow for rebooting without unplugging.Smooth operation, although the firmware set up is a bit confusing and more complex than it needs to be."
1,"Oh darn, I bought a wcg200 Cisco thing also","Had a been flooded lost my motorola cable modem. Purchased the wcg200 without checking first and now I am stuck. BUYER BEWARECISCO IS NOT THE COMPANY THEY USED TO BE.I was a ccna, ccnp and I tell you what. I never would have thought Cisco would care less of there product. This complaint is 76 pages long going back well into early 2006.BUYER BEWARE CISCO IS NOT A GOOD PRODUCT"
2,"Worked well, until it didn't. got the drops after about 1.5 yrs","I love the simple one box solution. Got about 1.5 yrs out of it, really about one year before it started getting the high traffic drops that thay are prone to.Chatted with Lynksys on line and was shocked how bad the CS/TS is.I am seriously looking at the Motorola product."
1,Please do not buy WCG200 (0 Stars),Please do not buy WCG200 because it wireless disconnects every 5 mins. The router part of the modem+router is flawed. I did not research before buying WCG200 and had to return WCG200 after experiencing the well discussed wireless disconnect issue. I bought Motorola Surfboard which is rock solid although it has a fewer features than WCG200 and costs more.
2,Cannot run torrents wirelessly,"It's great having a wireless router/modem combination. This particular model, however, crashes when attempting to download large torrent files wirelessly. If you plan on downloading such files, get a different system. Linksys appears to be aware of the problem, but does not have any solutions.If you plug in to the router directly, the problem is resolved. This issue is repeatable. Don't buy this modem if you ever plan on downloading torrents.[...]."
1,Another miserable customer,"I'm having the problem that other users below are reporting - the WCG200 is losing its connection with Comcast when I visit steaming video websites like MTV.com (but it still functions as a wireless router for my home network). It needs to be rebooted in order to regain connection to the internet. Linksys tech support is useless - I've contacted them 4 times. They (laughably) claim that my ISP is the only one with firmware updates for the modem. My ISP, Comcast, says (of course) they don't support any hardware that customers buy, only stuff we rent. Also useless. I now have a $100 brick that nobody will take responsibility for. Pathetic."
1,Did not function well,It is a faulty piece or could be a bad product itself. I do not recommend it toany one.
1,Hell hath no fury....,"This book really is just a divorce tale with celebrities as the bait for the purchase. It is a dreary read. The author seems to be a lonely, living in the past with bad memories. As I tried to read the book I found that it involves the personal vengeance of an unknown journalist on unkown people that are already dead. It is more a sad personal diary of someone whose life did not work out than a book with a tale to tell."
4,lean and mean,"Stripped down, drinking, driving classic Scott Miller. More literary than past releases- a tad more understated. Stays with you for that very reason.I would give it five stars but I have to save that rating for Willie and Family live- and scott's next record."
2,Sounds like amateur night at the mic,"I love the music of Sentenced, especially the more recent albums. ""Cold White Light"" may be one of my all-time favorite discs. What better way to wrap up their career than with a killer live album?Sadly, this effort should be -- pardon the pun -- buried. These tracks display musicianship as stellar as ever. The two vocalists, however, appear to have stumbled on stage drunk, incoherent and unconcerned. Sloppy, off-key and seldom aware of the melody, the vocal performances are a sad foil to the power and beauty of these songs."
4,A quite good science fiction novel of what comes after homo sapiens...,"This is a very well-written novel about a man who possesses the gift, or the curse, of fully-developed telepathy. The protagonist, Paul Breen, is able to read minds, and has other ""wild talents"" as well. The author develops a very plausible story around this scenario. This is an engrossing novel and a quick read. Too quick, really.My main criticism of this novel is that it has an incomplete, rushed feeling to it. The characters are not fully developed, and the plot is hurriedly rushed to conclusion. The author is clearly capable of much better, given the fact that the novel as written is quite good.Four stars for plausibility, and as a page-turner. Recommended."
2,Not for beginers,"I bought this because we very much enjoy the ""Childeren's Songbook"" which is truly designed for the well, shall I say, nearly useless. The childern's songbook gives numbers for your fingers and allows you to plunk out each song, note by note. The amazon website it gives the impression the christmas book is the same way. It is NOT!!! You have to have I clue, which as you can surmise, I do not. Don't be fooled if you are looking for another very simple songbook."
5,Impressed,"This book is great for intermediate to advanced. Beginners will have a hard time. The huge list of Christmas songs is wonderful! I couldn't be happier with purchasing this book. The arrangement is classic, just as you recall the carols sounding, both traditional and contemporary, every Christmastime. But if you are a very advanced pianist, this may not be much of a challenge; I've been playing for almost 10 years, although not consistantly, and I found it just the right amount of challenge to fit my busy schedule to learn the music. It's delightful."
3,deer hunter,"Well this movie was pretty much childs play,i;ve seen worser films,like revelation wich has lots of violence and graghic gore and detailed."
5,A Must-own HD DVD!,"To summarize the whole thing, I've got to say this film is amazing.There are some of the most beautiful scenes ever put on film in this title. These are contrasted with some disturbingly hellish imagery brought about by the tragedies of war. The story is truly compelling.The HD DVD presentation offers the best picture you could expect from a 1978 film. The picture comes across as clear as the film can possibly be, finely detailed and very clean. The audio is excellent too for a film from this era.""The Deer Hunter"" is a three hour film, and for me the best way to view it was to hold onto it until having waken up at four in the morning one day and watch it with morning coffee...but that's just me. If you can stay focused on a film this long toward the latter part of the day then go for it. It's a great movie, either way.I very highly recommend ""The Deer Hunter"" on HD DVD!"
2,Feel sorry for the poor Americans.,"'The Deer Hunter' has some really powerful and moving moments, but the entire movie is just a bunch of bologney. The story is about a group of steel workers who go off to Vietnam, and because of the war, their lives are destroyed forever. The idea is nice, but the movie protrays the Americans as good-willed and noble, while protraying the Vietnamese as money-grubbing, mean-spirited devils. Many parts are extremely long, drawn out, and flat out boring.I wonder why the film doesn't show anyone protesting the war in America. I also don't remember hearing or reading about U.S. soldiers being forced to play Russian Roulette..."
2,Slooow,"I watched this in the theater in the late 70's and had nightmares about it, but I have memories of liking parts of it. Watching it recently I could not find much to like. It was slow. I expected more action and less character building or something. It is now in the garage sale collection... free to a good home."
3,Worth a view if you have the time,I dislike long movies and this is a long one. But it is decent and enjoyable for a Saturday afternoon.
3,Something missing,"I was eager to purchase this 100th Anniversary edition of The Deer Hunter, one of my favorite films. However, the only special feature in this particular edition is an audio commentary by the cinematographer being interviewed by a jounalist. While interesting at times, and I learned some things I did not know, the interview/commentary was very often flat and boring and spoke really only about lighting, location, camera angles etc, for 3 hours with a snip it here and there about the actors. Rather disappointing. That is all there is extra in this edition. Too bad. Another quite puzzling thing, this edition is missing an entire scene! The scene where Linda (Meryl Streep) and Michael (Robert DeNiro) become very briefly involved/romantically due to their overwhelming grief over Nick (Christopher Walken). So, simply for this reason, I would invesigate purchasing either a director's cut or otherwise uncut version of this film with more extra features."
2,Another WAY overrated 1970's flick...,"what was it about movies made in that decade? Was everybody so high that they thought anything controversial made for ""great art""? This movie was mind numbingly boring for the first hour, and felt like a bunch of pieced together demo reel's for the second two hours. I had heard many people compare this to ""Apocalypse Now"" (one of the greatest movies ever made), this movie was not even close. The cinematography and audio (including the musical score) was some of the worst I have seen/heard in a while. The ONLY good thing about this movie was it's grat cast of actors. At the end of the flick I had only one comment ""well that's another 3 hours of my life that I'll never get back""."
3,Tooooooo long.,The movie history is ok. The players were greats. But the edition was terrible. The first hour could be reduced to about 25 minutes easily.
1,"Five stars for the movie, one for this edition","1) I would like to say that the British and the French editions (zone 2) of this present double DVD have on disc 2, in place of cut parts of the movie, two interviews of Michael Cimino and John Savage, which I heartly recommand to those who love The deer hunter. If you can read zone 2 DVDs on your computer or DVD set, you can buy one of those editions (in English with optional subtitles) on amazon.co.uk or amazon.fr, and I bet you will prefer that.2) Though I really love Meryll Streep, I feel bad that her picture has replaced John Savage's one on the cover of this edition. Doesn't make sense."
2,"An overlong, bloated film.......","The Deer Hunter is an overlong, bloated film consumed by a sense of its own self-importance.Giving it a best picture oscar was one of the worst blunders ever. The film is practically pointless and rambles on and on. A great anti-war picture? There are far, far better ones (Paths of Glory, All Quiet on the Western Front). Is Deer Hunter anti or pro anything? You bet. It is anti-intellectual and pro mindlessness.A self indulgent three hour symphony of incoherent sentimentality, inarticulate dialogue and congratulatory posturing."
5,The best....,Seeing this film back in the late 70's after the war had ended was so real and seeing it again more recently and older of course I feel it is better now...this is not about the war per se but about the effects. The absolute best and I will never ever forget the last seen with Michael and Nicky. DeNiro was absolutely superb.
1,I'd give it zero if I could!,"What junk! I thought ""What a Wonderful World"" would be by Louis Armstrong, its not, but some poser who really sounds so bad, my ears bled. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. Maybe for a penny, it would be worth it for the case, but outside of that, STAY FAR AWAY!!"
5,Gardiner does it again,"I remember the words of the reviewer in the distinguished English periodical ""Gramophone"" who had just written a chapter on ""Missa Solemnis"" for a book on choral recordings - they were to the effect of ""If I'd heard this version before the chapter went to press, I'd have written it completely differently"". Amen to that. No other version comes close, and that's saying something, considering that some very distinguished folk (Karajan, Klemperer) have done it. Gardiner fills it with fire and passion which is often spine-chilling. Absolutely marvellous! My loans of the disc to friends don't last long, because they promptly rush out and buy their own!"
3,"Very compact, Good UI - but not the greatest pictures","I bought this for someone else who really wanted something ultra compact, and with a big screen. The screen is definitely nice. The UI is simple - also an important factor. The startup is also fast.This is not the camera to buy if you want great picture quality. The graininess on zoom in shows up always regardless of the settings and seems to be an artifact of the algorithms they use to compress the image. I have a Nikon Coolpix 5400, and have compared the images side by side. Even though you have more pixels on the Casio (and hence much larger files), the image is far better on the Nikon."
4,Very easy to use,"This is a great camera for people like me who mainly just want to point and shoot and not deal with too many settings. I was even able to teach my mother-in-law how to use the one we got them (she's a little technologically challenged). There are a bunch of different ""best shot"" settings that are easy to use, but honestly most of my pictures have turned out best using just ""snapshot"" or auto mode, regardless of the environment/time of day, etc. It would be nice if you could charge the battery just by plugging in the camera, but I guess you have to pay a little more for that feature. The photo software that comes with it is not good, but there are plenty of other things you can use out there for free."
3,Not too shabby,"Not the Best movie, but worth seeing. if your looking for a movie to make you laugh alot than thi isn't it. But its alot better than some other movie out there so just give it a chance"
4,Funny,Whatever Martin and Danny Devito plays in you can bet it will make you laugh. Great plot & funny movie to see
1,"What's the Worst That Could Happen? Well, Expecting this to be a funny movie for once","So not funny, I am a fan of Martin Lawrence's comedyflicks but this just isn't funny... and what's up with the gay fashion policeofficer?Danny Devito isn't funny at all in this film, and he ahas the lead in it so it gets really annoying watching it...Even BLACK KNIGHT was 5 times better... do not even rent this movie..."
1,What format?,The video wouldn't play on my player.I didn't read about a format for different players.It would notplay on my player.
5,Extremely funny!,"One of the funniest movies we have seen!Danny DeVito and Martin Lawrence are great together, great cast and story line! Guaranteed to make you laugh!Another movie you can watch over and over, great stress reliever!"
3,RapRetarded More Like,"LOL Just read that kids review below. I estimate he is about 14 years old at the most. That comment was the most ignorant and stupid comment I have read on this site. Classic stuff. As said before DO SOME HOMEWORK KID!!! How can you review an album without even hearing it? or knowing who the artist is? Also slagging off Snoop over Eminem is just showing your ignorance to Hip Hop in general.Admittedly this is not RBX's best work, but it is also not bad either. worth getting to fill your collection with and if there is nothing else around, but again as said above there are far better albums out there, and If you are new to RBX the without question seek out The Chronic and Snoops Doggystyle. Apart from being two of the best Gangsta albums ever produced the collaborations from the guest artists such as RBX and Daz make them all the more enjoyable."
5,RBX Has no MERCY and no REMORSE!,"RBX is a great find, it is a shame he does not have a big record company backin him or some promotion - nice beats and smooth dark rhymes - Highly recommended."
5,awesome,"Amazing. Folksy-blues-country-bluegrass. Call it what you will. You will love this. I can't emphasize how satisfied I am with this cd. I would not be surprised if these guys pick up some serious momentum within the next few years. Great music, smart, witty, and humorous lyrics, and great musicianship. This cd can literally turn a s***** day of work on the road, into a great time. If you are from any sort of rural area, you will love this cd that much more. I saw Jalan on youtube, and was so impressed I bought all of his cds. I have never done this before, for anyone."
5,Too small for the Nikon P6000,"Nice case for the money - for some reason I had figured this would fit the Nikon P6000, but I was wrong... the case is a bit too small. But, the case turned out to be a great add-on to my day hiking pack to hold stuff. Targus items are usually reasonable values."
3,WRONG DIMENSIONS,The bag is well padded and belt loop is great - however your product dimensions were wrong. It is much smaller than what description said. It may or may not work for me - would of been nice to know correct size of bag.
5,Love these bras!,"I wear a 38DD and after pregnancy and nursing my ""girls"" need all the support they can get!I found this bra when I was a maid of honor in a friends wedding - I had my doubts because I have NEVER been able to buy a strapless bra in a department store. I was desperate (I traveled 400 miles for the wedding forgetting my overpriced specialty store bra!) and I was THRILLED TO DEATH with this bra!!It held the girls up all night where they are supposed to be, I danced hard all night long and I didn't have to do any pulling or tugging at the bra. It never moved! I went back and bought one of each color and i use them all the time now - good grief, I was paying 3-4 times as much for bras from other stores to get the same support that this bra gave me for only $20!I kid you not - I can jump up and down in this bra and never fall out and need very little adjustment afterwards!"
4,Good Starter Tape...,"This is great if you are just starting out, but if you have been lifting weights even the little 2 pound ones..this won't do much good...It does move very fast though.."
5,Memories,Hadn't heard this music in years! Was glad to find it again! The tape arrived quickly without any problems. thanks
4,A great raunchy read,"I hadn't read this since my adolescence and (like a lot of things I enjoyed at that age) I was prepared to be disappointed. However, I wasn't ; this was a fantastically amusing and sexy novel, although never offensive (unless you are related to any of the real-life characters !)"
5,hilarious!!!,"Roald Dahl is truly a genius! When I bought the book and started reading it I couldn't put it down and finished it at one go. I don't remember having read a funnier, a more brilliantly written book!!!! The guy is a wizard!!!!!"
5,Dahl spins a fairy tale for adults,"As a kid, I loved Dahl's children's books. As an adult, he makes me laugh with his short stories, and especially with this thoroughly entertaining adult fiction. In it, he he tells of three characters out to collect the genes of famous or brilliant men, with their consent but not their knowledge. I giggled through the entire book in anticipation of each new ""collection"" scheme. This is a book for all Dahl fans."
5,Great Book!,I thought this book was great. I have taken a decorating class which included some of Winbeckler's flowers. This book expands on that class. With some practice I think I can easily follow his directions to create beautiful flowers for my cakes.
2,Wish I Had'nt Bought This Book,"I wish I had'nt bought this book! My only excuse is that I needed some guidelines for decorating in buttercream, and after reading the reviews, thought this book might do the trick. I was mistaken.I have given 2 stars, as the recipe is good (I have used it to create buttercream flowers learnt from other books), and the few colour photos look beautiful. However, as a teaching aid, there just is'nt enough detail to help the reader achieve what is shown. What is there is sketchy at best, with no clear instructions to help overcome problems a learner would face. The book is too thin for the price...it just feels like everything is condensed and crammed in.This book may help if you are already an accomplished buttercream artist, like the author, but definitely not if you're looking to learn something new. Winbeckler is'nt into giving away too many secrets in his book."
2,"34 pages with 5 pages of instructionss - the rest ""ideas""","I am taking a icings flower class from a bakery/cake supply shop. This is a suggested book, so I bought it. Waste of money. I did not read that it was only 34 pages. Every cake is based on the oval you see on the front. Just different beautiful flowers on each one. Very little teaching at all. The teaching is in black and white, too. I should not have bought this book. I am taking my second decorating class. This book seems like someone experienced would use. For the amount of money, you can find a book with alot more ideas.P.S Anybody taking any kind of cake decorating class should take them from a bakery/cake supply shop. It will be ten times more beneficial than the Michael's or Hobby Lobby's Wilton classes."
2,Not what I expected at all!,This item was not good! I burned my neck using it becuase in the picture I did not realize to clmap it down you have to open it. I never had a hair appliance that was backwards and so difficult to use. It is unfortunate becuase I was looking forward to using it :(
5,Purchased for Carpenter Son,This book was purchase for my son who has a side job doing carpentry work while in college. He's learned alot about bidding a job and putting estimates together for the side jobs he's hired to complete.
1,Give me a break !,"After it won an Oscar , I went to se it ... than I went to se Fargo , the one it did "" beat "" for the best movie . As result - I never watching Oscars .. no more !What do I remember about this documentary for the classes for bad acting by good actors ? SHOW ME THE MONEY ! That's all . I was trying to take a nap during the movie , but my seat was uncomfortable and I had a worst torcher of my life - I watched all of it . After seing shrink for few years ... I think , I am going to do better - I don't se the nightmares anymore ... and I don't wake up with scream out of my mouth : SHOW ME THE MONEY !PS : How much does it cost to "" win "" the oscar ?"
4,"In a cynical world, there's something good to it.","The first time I saw this movie was just a couple months ago, and the reason was I didn't think it would be worth the effort to sit and watch. But...I started to take notice of Renee Zellweger, and the various roles she played. Even this movie which made her an instant sensation overnight. Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is the most miserable excuse of a human being who has the job of a sports agent, and he gets canned from his job real soon. But as he gets ready to leave, Dorthy Boyd(lovely Renee) finds the courage to wanna leave with him. Jerry's only hope in wanting to stay on top of the game is to stick with his one client Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr. who really steals this movie). Ultimately, it is a movie about finding not just a love and respect from other people, but with the person inside you. And in the end, Jerry truly does find it with Dorthy who completes him very much. Not the greatist movie of all, but yes it's very appealing."
1,"Boring, Discusting and Pointless----DON'T WAST YOUR MONEY",It is a big mistake to buy this film...I don't see any drama in it...you will sleep if you saw this film. And the sex seen is so long...I don't beleive that some one loved this movie!!!!!
2,SHOW ME MY MONEY BACK!,"Who would have thought that Tom Cruise would play the all-american-loveable-but-vulnerable-goodlooking-diamond-in-the rough-worldly-yet-naive-all-around-hunky-good-guy? So, for everyone who has seen this film it's no shock that Cruise is back here doing the same old thing, only for even longer with more annoying co-stars (his love interest and her irritating son are appalling!) Cuba Gooding Jnr is great and is responsible for both of the stars I gave this film. A weepy, woe is me, glutton for punishment, chick flick which is only worth seeing if you think Tom is the man!"
1,Nothing but a chick flick.,"This is the most overrated movie ever. Glorified soap opera with a few sports stars to make it easier to convince the men to be dragged to this stupid, sappy idiotic piece of garbage ever to be put on film. Made me wanna barf. Buyer BEWARE!"
2,Hey Cuba!,"Hey Cuba! William H. Macy wants his Best Supporting Actor Oscar back for Fargo that you ripped of of him for your ""performance"" in Jerry Maguire!!"
5,Great special edition for a special film.,"This film is on my top ten list of best movies ever, because you basically have so much fun watching it. And it has comedy, drama, romance, sports, great characters and a great script. And Cuba Gooding Jr. rocks here."
5,a fun movie,"It was a great movie, plus I was an extra in the movie, when it was filmed in Phoenix, Tom Cruz, & Cuba Gooding Jr are two of my favorite actors"
2,Not a film worth spending money on...disappointing,"When I saw Jerry Maguire, I was in a word, disappointed. The plot was weak and, as were the characters. The one positive part of the movie was the comic relief provided by the little boy."
2,So What?,"A predictable love story with an ending you could see coming with the opening credits. Cruise plays, well, Cruise, as only he can. (The man can't truly act his way out of a paper bag-he is so one-dimensional.) Zellweger carries her role well, and Gooding is excellent. I bought the original DVD version at my wife's request (and she now wonders what she was thinking). At least I didn't waste even more money buying the SE version. I give it 2 stars - one for Zellweger, one for Gooding.That's another thing that frosts me with this industry. They hype the new release, you buy it, and later come out with the SE version. If it's a movie you really want to add to your collection, you get your pocket picked. So, the moral of this story is clear. Don't buy the first version - rent it and wait 6 to 8 months for the better version.Regards to all."
5,Perfect production.,"Cameron Crowe, Rene Zelleweger, Cuba Gooding and Tom Cruise were all at the top of their game. The superlative fluidity and cinematic thrill of this successful feature was facilitated by experienced actors in sync, and guaranteed by superb production and studio crafts. A timeless classic - In a class of its own."
4,Just a gosh darn good movie...,"Tom Cruise, Cuba Gooding Jr. and a really, really cute kid will warm your heart in this feel-good movie about the redemption of a sports agent's soul.There aren't a whole lot of surprises here, but for what it is, it is well done."
3,A muddled film.,"Jerry Maguire starring Tom Cruise didn't blow me away like everyone else. Yes there are some remarkable performances such as Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Renee Zellweger (in her breakthrough role) but the plot is so in your face and contrived. Cameron Crowe's films tend to disappoint even though fans and critics adore him. Zellweger's funny and touching performance as lonely single mom, Dorothy is the main reason to watch this film, I remember watching her performance and thinking - she is going to be a huge star back in 1996, she is such a natural. Cruise isn't too shabby either but his character is so smug, it's hard to believe this guy actually has a good heart underneath. Love it or hate it, Jerry Maguire is over-rated."
4,A great movie,"This is one of the greatest movies of the 1990's and definetly Tom Cruise's best acting yet. Renee Zellwager as Dorothy Boyd couldn't have asked for a better film to make her big break in. She is outstanding in this Romantic Comedy. The movie has a great plot, although it did seem to drag on a little at certain parts. It's incredible to get to go on this journey with Jerry Maguire as he learns that there is more to life than money. This is a great movie all around."
5,Wonderful Jazz Trio Recording!,"If you like jazz trios playing standards, you'll love this album. It's very well played as a group, and the solos are thougtful and innovative as well. Get it - you won't be sorry! And by the way, it maxes out a CD's capacity at 79+ minutes of music. You can't ask for more on a CD!"
5,Review,"I bought this just to listen to Anne Sofie Von Otter's voice on ""Schlafe mein Liebster ..."". Very beautiful."
4,Bach Beautifully Done,"This is an excellent version of the Christmas Oratorio, beautifully played and sung. Gardiner's approach is more reserved than Jacobs's (Harmonia Mundi), and Gardiner's choral and orchestral texture emphasizes cohesion and blend rather than pursuing interest in individual inner parts. The overall tone of the performance is quiet and peaceful rather than exuberant. The vocal soloists and choir are superb. The recorded sound is excellent, though it does tend to facillitate Gardiner's emphasis on blend."
1,not pleased,"I love uggs, I already had a pair of uggs before purchasing these. However I was displeased with the service and product. I live in VT, and the boots where being shipped from OR. by UPS. Usually what takes 5 to 7 buss. days took 14. And they were in stock when I ordered them. Next I had ordered the sand colored mini. The color didn't match up to the many different pictures I looked at online. The sole was really dark the trim was white, but the actual boot color was fine. Also the size was way to big. I had ordered the same size as my other pair of uggs that fit great, but these were easily 1 to 2 sizes to big.? So I sent them back."
1,Really?,"There are a few good things here, like the distinct sound of the harpsichord, and the beautiful voices in the choir. Von Otter does her part well and Augér is OK, but just barely. She has two voices, one of which doesn't work here.The list of bad things is long, though. The choir sounds unspired, the alto lacks both depth and clarity and the orchestra's timing is off. But all those things are just nitpicking. Then there's John Tomlinson. Honestly, he sounds like a drunk who's swallowed a fog horn. The yoke is easy, but this a joke.A solid 1/5. Is it really that bad? Well, if it wasn't for the basso, it would be rather enjoyable, albeit a bit dull and uninspired, but as it is, it simply doesn't work at all.Listen to the mp3 excerpts.."
4,Slow and ponderous,I kept wanting to grab the baton and speed the tempo a bit.Arlene Auger is marvelous!
5,Excellent version!,"I am not the biggest classical fan, but this is one of my favorites to listen to. It is a classic of classics with the Hallelujah Chorus, WOrthy is the Lamb, and others. Excellent buy!"
5,My favorite Messiah by far!,"I love this album with the virtuoso harpsichord playing by the conductor, Trevor Pinnock, on period instruments, and the near perfect soloist interpretations. The spirit is just right with it and you will adore it. I hope it becomes your standard as it is ours. God bless."
3,why until now i still have not received the book of security analysis,why until now i still have not received the book.could someone have to fixed it. i have waited for 3 monthes already
4,"this book and ""the inteligent investor"" is the bible of investment","a great book that shows you the fundamentals and practices of security analysis. if you want to learn about it, this is the book for you."
2,"A Great Read, But Skimpy Coverage","There are other, individual guide books for the Grand Strand and for Charleston that cover each respective area in much greater detail. I found the other guides to be indespensable, whereas Moon is a great fun read, but not nearly as useful."
4,Great,I bought this for my 4 year old - I thought it was to old for her - hey she loves it and so do I.It is easy to take apart - great job
5,Good Product,"Saved my wedding day and made it worry free with my strapless dress. Sticks so well, but also peels off without ruining the clothing. One note from a wedding perspective: it DOES collect birdseed! :)I would recommend this product."
2,Confused,"I have to admit to being a little confused why people are shelling out $14 for a book about a self-centered,immature kid. Nothing about him is likeable or admirable especially the way he treated people that loved him. He got what he was searching for, a suffering martyr's death. Krakauer is a good author but he definitely seems to be guilty of padding this one. Due to a lack of specific material to make a novel he continuously inserts long philosophical quotes and excerpts from his own wanderings and anyone else he can think of that had a similar journey. The world is full of people that have much more to be bitter about than this kid not to mention a world full of bums that make his adventure look like a ride in the park."
2,Gave the author a second chance...,"I bought ""Into The Wild"" after struggling with ""Into Thin Air"". The story of Chris McCandless in ""Into The Wild"" didn't have enough substance to fill a book. Then, as if to fill in the huge gaps, the author gives us an account of his own hiking stories like that would interest anyone other than himself. I would have felt that buying both of the books was a waste of money. I redeemed myself by giving them both to my boss asking him not to return them. I also think the practice of taking a paperback, making it taller and wider than most paperbacks and charging double is highway robbery."
2,Into the wild,I didn't really enjoy this book. I couldn't believe the lack of knowledge this young man displayed to venture into the Alaska Wilderness unprepared and alone. Living in the North I know the dangers and power of mother nature. I had to force myself to finish reading it as I knew the outcome right from the get go. Not much suspense!!
4,Tragic and compelling,"I must confess that I skimmed through Jon Krakauer's accounts of his own adventures into the wild, and chose to focus on the events related to the journey of Chris McCandless. These events are dramatic, interesting reading - especially in the context of other adventurers Krakauer has researched. This is an eminently readable book, and I feel sympathy for those who cared for McCandless and have lost his presence in their lives."
4,Somthing to think about,"Into the wild is well written and easy to read. In my opion it is not exactly an unbiased version of the story though. Krakauer is to like the character he is writing about to be able to write the story from an unbiased point of view. The story of Chris McCandless is an adventure and a drama. The book gives an insight into who McCandless was, making the story more personal. The book raises many interesting questions and I liked the way it made me think. Krakauer wonders a bit form time to time away from his subject, but other then that I enjoyed the book. Wether or not you can identify with McCandless, this book will give you somthing to think about."
4,Krakauer gives great insight into this disaster,"The examples explored by Krakauer parrallel McCandless' situation and add meaningful insight into why this tragedy took place. Krakauer himself gives pertinent examples from his own past that explores the minds of young men longing for something that they don't have. He is able to give a first hand account of what goes through the minds of men who put themselves into dangerous situations. By using his and other examples, Krakauer relates them to the story of Chris McCandless. There really isn't a dull point in the book as Krakauer continually brings intriging new details of McCandless' adventures. These adventures are brought into better light as Krakauer relates them to his and others' experiences."
3,Insane?,"While it is an interesting book, it seems to be nothing more than a collection of facts. It was much like reading a cross between a newspaper article and an editorial with the authors thoughts on why McCandless did what he did. McCandless was nothing more than a nice but disturbed young man that started out on the track to a normal life in society and then got the ideals of Thoreau stuck into his head which in turn clouded his better judgment. Even Thoreau would have never trekked off into the wilderness of Alaska with the provisions that McCandless had. Over all it kept my attention but just barley."
3,I was expecting better!,"Krakauer's style of writing made many parts of this book hard to understand. He skipped off and on the subject of McCandless many times. He includes his own testimony and the accounts of others on the same type of quest as McCandless, which in my opinion, was very unnecessary. I felt that Krakauer could have approached the circumstances surrounding McCandless' dissaperance in a more organized or chronological way. Krakauer states in the begining of the book that he will be giving an unbiased account of the McCandless tragedy, yet this book was anything but an unbiased account. I think that this book could have been a lot better, I was dissapointed by it."
3,Sparks adventure,"The way Alex behaves might anger you at times, but the kid sure knows how to have a good adventure"
5,Excellent and suspenseful...,"The first book that I read by Jon Krakauer was Into Thin Air, also an excellent book. After reading that book in just a day or two, I immediately ordered Into the Wild, and was not disappointed. Into the Wild is one of those great books, not only is it a exciting piece of outdoor/adventure literature, but it is very entertaining and has a familiar and realistic foundation. This is also an account of a sad, sad event. I am not an overly emotional person, but this author has seemingly found my soft spot twice. This is one of those books that you loan out to five different people before loosing track of it and are happy to have it in circulation amongst friends and family. A great read, and highly recommended."
3,Need For A Purpose,"Krakauer has effectively reconstructed the tragic tale of Chris McCandless' naive and fatal plunge into the Alaska winderness in search of his young man's need for a purpose. Death is often the catalyst of couriosity and this book does not dissapoint in it's complete analysis of when, how and possibly why McCandless died. Everyday young men and women set out on similar quests for understanding in unforgiving rural and urban windernesses. Most live to tell about it. Some, like McCandless, don't.207 pages is quite long for this story that could have been told effectively in a series of magazine articles or as part of a collection of shorter writings. I would hope that McCandless's tragedy will serve as a guiding light for others who seek ""the meaning of life"" and those who think they are ready to tackle life on the road and/or the true wilderness."
3,"Into the wild: good reporting, but less personal experience","In ""Into the Wild"" Krakauer does an excellent job of telling Chris ""Alex Supertramp"" McCandless's story. He goes into great detail with personal conversations with those who knew Chris. This was a great way to get the personal side of Chris's story, but when Krakauer intervined with his own experiences, it detracted from what should have been the overall purpose of the story, which is the story of Chris McCandless. I feel that if Krakauer, although a great outdoorsman, would have left out his personal experiences, the book would have been easier to understand and more well-rounded and enjoyable."
2,A reasonably good read about a fool,"The book as a work of literature is okay. I guess. It seems to meander about looking for something to say. In addition, I don't trust Krakauer as a chronicler, as it is my understanding that he played fast and loose with the facts in both ""Into Thin Air"" (to the fury of some of those who were there) and ""Under the Banner of Heaven."" My biggest problem with the book is that I found Chris McCandless to be a juvenile fool. Despite his alleged superior intellect, he behaved and wrote like a 14-year-old. I really see no reason for glorifying this idiot. His demise was nature's way of purifying the gene pool of a little lunacy."
2,Short story at best,This has the potential to be a great story if there werent so many fill in the blanks. You can read the authors note and pretty much be done with the book.Never have so many words been written about so little subject matter.
5,This book is for any adventurer.,"McCandless was intriguing. He takes what you dream about and does it. He lived simply after school, and I think the reason for a poor relationship with his parents was their inability to understand him and why he went where he went and did what he did. I can relate to McCandless in that respect. Some people want you to fit the mold, they think you should do it this way or that, and they certainly believe their way is the best. McCandless went against the grain of security and easy living. Instead he worked hard when he worked and ate and lived meagerly. He experienced all the highs and lows of life never fearing what may lie ahead. Nothing could hold him back, not even money - in fact to prove it he either gave it away or burned it. And one of the best things of all, he left an impression on people, he changed their lives and gave them a new perspective. You won't be able to put this book down and it may just change your life."
4,A journey into the wild adventures of Chris McCandless,"I thought this story portrayed the emotions and opinions of the main character Christopher McCandless. The author, Jon Krakauer, did a wonderful job showing Chris' frustration with his family and his need to be spontaneous. Krakauer shows how McCandless felt that the typical lifestyle of most of us is just not sufficiently adventurous. Krakauer demonstrated the way these ""hitch hikers"" or ""tramps"" feel by interupting McCandless's story with excerpts from other people that did similar things to what McCandless did. The excerpts helped reflect why some people desire to live a life of adventure and nature even if it means an unnecessary, painful death. Jon Krakauer does an excellent job of getting the reader into the mind of Christopher McCandless."
3,A hitchhiker's guide with a sad end,"This tale of ""Alex"" who started by driving, then hitchhiking and finally walking into the Alaskan wilderness has a tragic end. Jon Krakauer dragged up all kinds of information about the recent graduate's tracks, interviewing those that Alex had befriended on his travels.The story is somewhat disjointed - in part because Alex did not take the straight route to Alaska - and also because there's not that much to tell so the story is interwoven with Krakauer's own and other insights into venturing off on one's own.The story is an easy read and well written, conveying a sense of adventure. Alex may have been criticized for being unprepared - which he was - but at least he took the time to explore his country.Those contemplating escaping from the real world into the wilderness will find a cautionary tale and useful ideas. It will also appeal to parents of hitchhikers and to armchair travelers who want to learn what its like to be a bum."
3,National Bestseller that is for you to decide.,"""Into The Wild"" by Jon Krakhauer is a story that tells of a man with everything that you could want in your life leaving it all behind for the wilderness of the Alaskan outback. It has somewhat of a pulp-fiction beginning that starts with the conclusion of the story and then goes on to tell how Christopher Johnson came to be in the situation. Some may beleive that he is somewhat selfish by ruuning off during hard family times trying to somehow pay his family back for all the trouble they had put him through. Before you make any jugdements of Christophers action look into both sides of his action. He also gave his savings to charity and abandoned what looked to be a fairly successful career. After reading this book however do you think that peoples outlook on his story and life changes would have changed if he would have successfully stayed alive in the wilderness."
3,It is an interesting story told well.,"In the book, ""Into the Wild"", Krakauer does an excellent job of telling the story of what really happened to Chris McCandless. He uses a unique style of telling us the events which led to the death of McCandless. He collected many details and researched very throughly into the McCandless's journeys. This research however led the readers with mixed feelings about the subject. I feel that McCandless was very bold and almost foolish. I can respect the fact that he was fulfilling a dream and venturing out on his own. I, however, believe their is a line between being daring and being stupid. McCandless could have had a chance of surviving if he had at least entered the challenge prepared. Instead he accepted nothing from anyone who tried to help him. He entered the Alaskan wilderness with nothing and accepted his own fate, death."
4,Into the Wild Audio Tape,"I am using this with my ELL students and it works fine for that purpose. The reading is a bit ""dry"" but the story is great."
2,Hated It!,"I think that the book is well written; I find Kraukhauer's style and organization quite good.I hated the chief character. I think that he was a spoiled brat, young and idealistic, and irresponsible. Regardless of your anger to your parents who have given you everything, you don't walk out on them, break off contact, and become a vagrant. Yes, a vagrant.While reading this book I knew my next one was ""My Just War"" by Gabriel Temkin. I didn't know what it was about, but I knew that it was about a Polish Jew who was in the Russian Army during WWII. I knew that it was going to be about survival.Temkin book did not let me down. It was about someone with nothing and no one who survived, prevaled and made something of his life. This was quite refreshing, compared to Into the Wild where the main character throws everything away.If you want to read about surviving during an incredible time in a terrible place, read Temkin' s book."
5,~Magnificent Book,"I found this book to be highly engrossing and quite frankly hard to put down, I stayed up till 3 a.m. reading it one night. I think everyone can take something away from this book after reading it which is really a true compliment. I have to wonder about the people who gave this book one star reviews and who call Chris stupid, naive and foolish. People like you have no problem with governments drafting young people for ""their"" wars only to killed for whatever the goverments cause was. Well Chris died for his own cause and I personally can't fault the man for that. Secondly, each of us in the end has a chance to live life the way they choose or at least how they will approach mentally and this was his choice. We must remember that we are reviewing actual books here and how it was written not the actual person in the book. I want to encourage everyone to read this book and then do some serious thinking afterward taking that inward journey which will only make you stronger."
5,Poignant!,"The main charecter - Christopher, had a great insight on tragedy, spirituality, life, the value of family and the importance of keeping your individuality. However, not always in that order. The book was very thought provoking. I highly recommend the movie as well as the book, as the movie really gives you a visual along with the words. The movie emphasizes how he touched other peoples life as well as how the same people affected his life on his journey to Alaska. A remarkable human being, however short his life on earth."
4,"Good book, easy to read.","My wife picked this up for me yesterday, I read it in about 3 hours. I hadn't really heard much about the story, but I was aware of the movie.I really enjoyed the book. I found it easy to relate to the main character (Chris). If you're the kind of person who likes to ponder the meaning of life and the evils of society when you're hiking/biking/camping out in the woods by yourself, then you'll probably like the book too.Highly recommended. Would have given it a 5 if it had a bit more suspense."
4,inspirational,"A true story of a young man from the suburbs of D.C. who leaves his parents and secure future and adopts the life of a vagabond. Alex McCandless lived the ultimate adventure before he set out to live off the land in the Alaskan back woods where he died of starvation. This is the psychological autopsy, if you will, of an eccentric and brilliant man who saw life a lot differently than most folks. I found the book to be inspirational in McCandless' demonstrated strength of will and daring to live his life according to his own convictions."
1,Are You Kidding Me?,"Wow, an anthem for idealistic, self-serving morons the world over. It's a shame people glorify this kind of weakness in a human being. The kid was obviously mentally ill. I'd recently bought the book but decided to go ahead and rent the movie. What a disappointment. Sean Penn tries much too hard to sell this poor, stupid kid as some kind of hero. Stop begging Sean."
2,the story wanders as much as the topic,Sections of the book are great but most of it wanders around other topics and people. Could have been much more focused.
5,Lonesome pines in snow,"This is an excellent read! But more than that, it is one of most moving and human stories you will ever have the pleasure of encountering by an author such as Krakauer, a splendid naturalist with a true ear for epiphany. Krakauer has a style unlike any writer this side of the twentieth century, and makes his way honestly and earnestly into the psyche of the reader, unexpectedly portraying a very real and true, almost unspeakable understanding of the young adventurer, Chris McCandless. If you are American, you absolutely must read this book! It should be cannonized."
2,Cliche Adventure With Some Insight About Life,"The boring details of McCandless' adventures are a punnishment to the reader. While his philosophies on life are interesting, a recounting of each person he met (and basically each new person is once again won over by the educated ascetic) becomes rather dull. Also, an insert of the author's own adventure is both vain and not essential. He tries to draw comparisons between himself and Chris McClandless that are both disrespectful to Chris's eventual plight and to his family. This would have made for an excellent short story used to support the ideas of H. David Thoreau, not an entire book that rushes to the top of the superficial bestselling lists. I might add that the book already includes an advertisement for his next book which was due to come out the next year."
4,Great Story,A story that hit close to home and shows how actions of one person can affect many people. Definitely a must read.
3,Jon's Quest,"Jon tried to help us understand the unexpainable actions of a misguided youth. Only through Jon's vivid description of his own journey into the the Alaskan wilderness, did we come close to feeling Chris McCandless' intentions."
3,Into the wild review,"This book was okay it wasn't all that great, but if you like an autobiography then this is the book for you."
5,Good as the description,The book is just as the way it is described. I received it in proper time . want to say thanks for the book
1,"Completely forgettable, disjointed and uninspiring","What a disappointment. Self-indulgent loner commits suicide by burning his cash and wandering into the Alaskan wilderness so that he can punish his parents for something (I'm not sure what). The writing style is disjointed and uninspiring, full of meaningless details about landscapes (who cares) and pathetic characters. The only emotion this book elicits is sympathy for those people who were unfortunate enough to cross paths with ""Alexander Supertramp."" What a waste."
1,One of the most boring books ever!,I had to read this book for Freshmen orientation... and I was so bored with the book. And I never got bored of books hell I'd read the same books over and over and never gotten bored. The book to me was clinical and lacked personality. If I'm having to read a book that's biographical I have to feel more for the character than boredom and annoyance. I think the only time I've touched that book since 1999 was each time I've had to pack up and move. For all of you who have read it and loved it good for you... maybe I'm just one of the few who didn't like it.
2,Well-written. Too self-defensive. Too much justification.,"Christopher McCandless. Yes, I think his actions were foolish and reckless. Yes, he tried to live his dreams, but he could do so for only short periods, before he had to return to the life he liked to complain about. Yes, I would not have the courage to walk off into the Alaskan ""wilderness"" with a bag of rice. If one used this as one definition of ""courage"", it would have to be cross-referenced to ""stupidity"".Jon Krakower has glorified this kid by featuring him in a book. Well-written, but in the end a waste of time.McCandless did not live long enough to achieve anything near his goals. This kid lived off the kindness of many people including his parents. When those people weren't around, he died. Basically un-impressive. One can only feel sadness for all the people he left behind."
3,"fascinating subject, drawn out too much","Fascinating subject, but stretched too thin byvaguely related information made more so by asomewhat random, meandering approach. I was leftlooking for more substance.Much better if shortened or if additionalsignificant detail were added."
2,"Interesting story, bland book","The story this book follows is an interesting story, but honestly I couldn't finish the book. I found that the author spent too much time compareing the kid Chris to himself, which made the book really bland. I enjoy reading about adventures in the wild, but alot of this book didn't even talk about Chris. The fact that the kid was so niave wasn't even the problem, it was how far on a pedestool the auther seems to hold his (chris's) ignorance. I hope the movie turns out better."
3,why did he do it?,"Chris McCandless had a college education, a nice family and book smarts. So why did he give it all up to walk into the Alaska wilderness armed only with a bag of rice? Instead of beating eaten immediately by a polor bear or a pack of wolves he was found 4 months later, having starved to death. So what was Chris McCandless? Was he a Darwin Award winner? Was he crazy or was he simply a romantic young fool? The book never really tells us and even the author can't make up his mind. All we really know is that in Alaska a young man's boyish notions ran smack dab into cruel reality.It's an interesting book about an endurring mystery."
4,Into the Wild review,This was a book my son had to read for his high school summer reading. I have also been reading the book. I found it to be an interesting character study of a young man who was trying to find out who he was but met with a tragic end when he could not find a way out of the Alskan wilderness.
4,Well written. Odd but interesting story.,"Krakauer has an impressive writing style and an amazing ability to piece together clues to a puzzle for which there is no certain conclusion. Much like Junger/Perfect Story, Krakauer uncovers amazing detail as he follows the odd journey of a lost young man that mysteriously walks into the wild one day and never returns. Much different read from Krakauer/Into Thin Air as this is not a first-hand account and the subject is far less inspirational. If you like Krakauer though, you will like this book."
4,A True Life Mystery,"I thought that ""Into The Wild"" and ""Eiger Dreams"" were better reading, but ""Into The Wild"" was a sad and compelling story. The side stories served to show that Chris McCandless was not an aberration. The mystery of his death, revealed in the last pages, was truly surprising."
4,Into The Wild review,"I have enjoyed reading this book. Jon Krakauer, the author, uses many examples of metaphors and imagery. This book is good to read if you enjoy a story about adventure and troubles that are overcome. The most exciting parts of the book are toward the end so it was very easy to lose interest in the beginning of the book.I didn't like the fact that the book is a biography, meaning it has a lot of detail. With the main character not telling the story, it is all based on journal entries and letters sent to and from him. This makes the story more confusing.I chose the book because of the cover and title. It is a picture of a bus driven into a snow bank out in the middle of nowhere. The title caught my attention because it is Into The Wild, and I thought it would be a good adventure book, which it was.I wouldn't suggest this book to young children because of some offensive language. Yet, to anyone who can handle it, I would encourage you to read it."
3,into the wild,"I didn't find this book particularly interesting. It was hard to follow at times, because it skipped back and forth between stories. It's about a man, Chris McCandless, who left home after college to make a new life for himself. He gave up his $25,000 in his savings to charity and dumped most of his possessions. He travels throughout the country meeting new people, hoping to get to Alaska. Finally, he gets to Alaska, but dies soon after. I would recommend that you don't read this book."
2,"McCandless is a strange, strange man.","Jon Krakauer's book Into the Wild is a wonderous story about a mans ability to do what ever his heart desires. The main character Chris McCandless was an adventurer that too often didn't think before his actions, he went on impulse, whick lead to his death in the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. Krakauer's writing and organization in this book was confusing. It is very jumppy and hard which made it hard to keep interest. The book was not only about the McCandless story but what type of person Krakauer thought him to be. McCadless was definately had a screwed up head. Why in the world would anyone throw away all their money, and roam the world. What is even weirder is that he thought that what he did was noble in his own sence. Krakauer points out some instences in his childhood that could have contributed to his mental state. McCadless was mentally deranged to do what he did. He should have done more smart planning."
4,"Definitely a mixed bag, but worth listening to","I think the best way I can summarize this recording is that Musica Antiqua Koln take chances. Of course this poses problems, since when their approach doesn't work it fails pretty disastrously. What I have in mind especially are the first movement of the sixth concerto, and the outer movements (especially the last) of the third, that are taken far faster than logic allows, the results being downright unmusical. The advantage is that, whatever faults you may rightly accuse them of, MAK are never boring. My own personal tastes in this music are for a much more peaceful, humane approach, but try as I might I can't deny that often the music making here has incredible joy and sense of purpose. In the end, if you listen to this recording in it's entirety with an open mind, I think you'll discover a way of approaching these works totally different from anything you'll find elsewhere, and really, isn't that something to be treasured? Vive le difference!"
4,algebra 1 by dolciani,"Well, this book was pretty good (as algebra books go). I was a student who used it. It explains the concepts you need to know well, but sometimes you get lost on the wording. or at least I did, and it cost me an answer or two. But considering the whole book, thats not bad. Compared to those Chicago Math Books, it's way better, those i get lost about every other sentance. So anyways, i give it 4 stars."
4,Surprisingly Good Movie,"I love James Woods and also like Brian Dennehy, but despite there being two excellent actors in it, the movie's description made it sound kind of dated, a 15+ year old cop drama that I had never heard of. But I thought, hey, for $2.99 for Vid on Demand, what do I have to lose!Wow, I was really surprised what a great film this was: of course my two favorite actors were excellent as usual, but the film, direction, story line, dialogue and cinematography was really good, to the point where it was hard to believe it had been made so long ago. Excellent movie, fast-paced and unpredictable, with James Woods playing a character who was both oddly sympathetic and at the same time, a cold blooded killer--who else could have played this role but him! The development of the bond between these two men--the author/cop and the killer--was fascinating to watch."
3,Not realistic...,The story line is so far out there its hard to sit back and enjoy it. What hired killer would insist on getting his memoir written?
4,Gardiner's greatest success with Mozart's operas !,"Gardiner has recorded all of Mozart's operas as far as I know. Based on the recordings I have heard by Gardiner, I think this set represents Gardiner's best conceived recording of any of Mozart's operas. It is a very insightful reading, the performances of the singers are uniformly excellent and the sound as well as the balance between voices and orchestra is as good as it gets. I think the authentic instruments approach suits this opera sufficiently well whereas I don't think it does in the case of Don Giovanni or Figaro for instance. In any case, this is a beautiful recording worth having."
2,Dust build up problem,"I've had the exact same problems as mentioned by an earlier reviewer. One of two smallish width planks it handles well. Anything more than that and it clogs very quickly and while it is easy to unclog, well sorta easy, it is a pain in the neck.Installation is very easy, take 5 mins, and the cost is low, but it's really not worth it."
4,Great service- great car,"The first car that was shipped out to us came defective and wouldn't move- but after letting these guys know of the problem they rushed out a second car without me even needing to send in the broken one! The car is very fast and pretty durable, my little brother is having a lot of fun with it."
1,Useless piece of ***,"I can't even describe my frustration. I used this only 1 or 2 times, mainly bc the power went out every.single.time I tried to vacuum, and I had charged it the night before! You can only vacuum for strictly less than 5 minutes (no exaggeration) and then it just died.I had to throw it out."
3,Does the job,"Good little, if weak,vacuum. Bought this for my work as a pastel artist. It picks up dust from my easel fairly well as long as I don't have big chunks. Good for my keyboard though."
1,Needs more power!!,this vac needs more power it dosent pick up anything. Looking for a small car vac this is not it.
4,Works Fine,"For everyone who is disappointed that this won't pick up a bowling ball, be realistic. This is a ""detailing"" vac which works great for small jobs. I've used it for vacuuming the dust out of my computer and I am not disappointed. Anyone looking for it to do more, move on."
4,Great but can't find filters,"I was using this to keep my keyboard and area clean of crumbs and cigarette ashes and it works great for that purpose.But now I can't find replacement filters except for 1 place which seems to sell them for $9.99 apiece. Forget that. If you know where I can get filters, please let me know.Don't buy this unless you know where to buy filters."
5,Espresso machine cleanup !!,"I have mounted this very small unit beside my pretty high-quality espresso machine and higher quality grinder. Coffee grind mess is a given of espresso fanatics, and this is a perfect cleanup tool. Really nice without or with the brush attachment, and no, it does not have much suction (barely seems like it inhales more than an iguana might), but it does the job. I cannot say if it is useful for any other task, but for the specific espresso-cleanup one, excellent."
3,Good hobby vac.,I purchased this for my ammunition reloading hobby and it works well for picking up loose power and polishing media. Not really strong enough for spent primers but it does well at cleaning my press from drit and powder.
4,unrealistic expectations,"some times i laugh at my own ideas of how a vacum this small would suck dirt glued to my keyboard with food protien. this little bugger works as well as can be expected, but not as well as maybe a cleaner lifestyle would . buy it and try it"
2,description is not correct,the item was so small the only thing I can use it for is to clean my computer's keyboard. The description of the item presents it as usable for car cleaning but I will lose it somewhere if I use it in my car
5,Planer blades,I found the exact blades I was needing on Amazon.com My previous source was $20.00 higher. Thanks!
1,BIG disappointment!,"Someody forgot to harden the steel used in these knives. The previous Delta knives lasted for 1000s of feet of use...I was lucky if I got 1000' w/ these, even with flipping them. Knots never have been a problem. With these knives pine knots dinged them repeatedly. Don't waste your $."
5,Exquisite German Renaissance Liturgical Music,"This rendition of Heinrich Schutz 'Musikalische Exequien' is rendered by what may be considered an 'all star cast', lead by director, John Eliot Gardiner with His Majesties Sagbutts and Cornetts, The Monteverdi Choir, and the English Baroque Soloists. Imagine one's surprise that this lineup of Anglican talent does so well with these High German pieces.The first thing which sets this apart from so many liturgical works is that it is not a rendering of a mass, even a Requium mass, even though it does include motet(s) for the funeral of a German prince. Another thing which strikes me as remarkable is that these works were written at the height of the 30 Years War which ravaged central Germany (actually, the 'Holy Roman Empire').The highest praise I can give this piece is that it actually rivals Bach's lesser liturgical works, especially in the richness of mix of voices and instruments."
1,Salon Surprise Barbie,What a pice of junk. My daughter was so disppointed in this toy. The doll's hair color changes at a snail's pace. Please save your money and buy something else. Mattel should be ashamed of themselves for producing such garbage!
3,Paintings in the Musee d'orsay,"Shipping was veryc quick and arrived in good shape. I had expected the book to be like new as the seller saidd excellent condition, It is bashed in the corners and slightly used looking so would consider this to be in good condition, not excellent condition. I do like the book though and am happy to get it so soon and just thought that it would be beter to say slightly used rather than excellent. Nonetheless I love the book, Many Thanks for your quick service. Karen"
3,Good book to learn all about fluids,"Although in my class we did not go through too many of the chapters I found it fairly easy to follow and if you have a strong interest in fluids this would be a great book.For those who don't have a strong interest in fluids you may find this to be a bit boring. i didn't find it keeping my interest, I was bored almost every time I opened it."
5,excellent introduction on fluid mechanics,"I like this book a lot. So, I am surprised that it received only an average review. On the other hand, I had no comparison since this is the only undergraduate level fluid mechanics book I own. But I do recommend that people get a good book on heat transfer and thermodynamics since those three topics are closely related. For heat transfer and thermodynamics, I recommend Incropera and Moran."
1,introductory book for the students in this subject,This is a real good looking book. But it turns to be a nightmere for the students who has lack in mathematics. It is also a bad breath to look into the explanations it has in the chapters it contains.
2,did not help at all,"did not help my signal get better at all, was really cheap so i gave it two stars because i did not have to pay alot for it."
4,Great Reception,"A great purchase, I have not lost reception since I received it. There has not been any areas where I receive a ""no signal"""
2,kind of disappointed,"I bought two of these. They arrived quickly and in good condition.I mounted them on windows where I usually get two bars of signal on the outside, but one to none on the inside. The improvement is hardly noticeable, and you have to be right next to the window (within a foot of the antenna) to see a rare bump up to two bars, but usually one bar. Using the phone inside, even next to the window, is still unreliable, and impractical.I guess I just have wait for my contract to end and change carriers. Another company has much better signal in our area."
2,Not much help,placed in large window with cell phones about 6 ft away and noted only very little improvement. It was cheap and worth the effort.
1,Can I have my money back? Please?,"Do not waste your money on this dvd set. Period. The only helpful thing about this set is that it has proven to be a cure for my chronic insomnia. I am a novice when it comes to car restoration, but any book is more helpful than this dvd. My wife bought this as a birthday gift and we both feel robbed of time and money."
4,I have to disagree.............never hung up on me....,"I even bought this as a refurbished item here at Amazon and have had no problems. The only issue I've found has been that I usually use DVD-RWs or DVD-Rs per my video recorder, but forgot that this only uses DVD+Rs.....etc.I purchased this for less than 1/2 the original price and have no regrets. I must admit that I purchase too many electronics and stay away from brands such as Emerson and Coby..............but stick with Magnavox and Sanyo..........etc. You get what you pay for.I can't relate to the ""hung-up"" problem of other buyers, but will vouch that I've had this refurbished recorder for over a year and have had no problems whatsoever. I often record onto VHS and mostly used this component to transfer it onto DVD. Worked well..........took some time to get used to..........but always did the trick for me.I only hope it works as well for the next buyer.............."
2,Great..if you get one that works,"When I bought this recorder back in October, I was extremely happy with it. Yes the interface sucks and the manual isn't much better, but once you figure it out, it rocks. So, why only two stars? The unit began locking up and refusing to either record from the timer, or eject the disc. After calling Customer Care, I was informed to send it back for repair. What I got back was a dented, scratched unit with missing parts that has now been labeled ""renewed"" (even though I bought it brand new) and the warranty has been shortened from 1 year to 90 days. Repeated calls to customer care only yields""I'm sorry we've escalated the problem and you should receive a call from us"" Well guess what, it's been a month now, and I stillhave the damaged unit and no calls from Magnavox. Next stop, BBB."
4,EXCELLENT RECORDER...so far so good,"I had been reading the previous reviews, so I was very skeptical about this recorder...even though it was priced just right for me. Thus...I have been drilling this thing for one week...playing dvds, and recording for long hours. I have yet to get this to freeze up yet. (i suppose there still is time) So far, for the price, it had everything I need and makes fine recordings. Even in the eight hour mode, it has good quality. Definitely better than VHS. Like others said, the only drawback, is getting used to the on-screen menus and symbols. But...if you read the manual closely, it explains everything. For $200, you cant beat it!"
5,A tender masterpiece,"Better known as a latter day Marxist art critic, Berger has always balanced a social conscience with an extraordinary eye for the beautiful.This novel is devestating...Berger's terse and direct style has never been more appropriate. This is a heartbreaking story of doomed lovers who affirm love despite fate and death. In the end the book challenges us to say, 'yes, i will, yes.' but without the obstacles. as jeanette winterson once wrote: art invites.This is an unforgettable book by a writer whose due for a Nobel prize recognition--that is, just so he can refuse it and go about his merry ways."
4,Beautiful writing,"John Berger is one of the best unknown writers on the planet. This book shows him in his element, writing about France and Italy in a way only he can. As with the characters he creates and lovingly describes, it is the journey of reading the book -- and not the plot's end itself -- that gives one pleasure. He is so sure-footed with his descriptions that you can sit there and roll the images he has created around in your mind. He brings a tenderness and wisdom to the story that, as with previous novels of his, make it feel less than just ""a story"" but rather something timeless like a fable or myth passed down for generations."
2,Sorry but I disagree...,"I am going to be the lone voice in the wilderness... I could not get into this book, could not make it past the first thirty pages. The narrative voice rambles from first person to third person, often it is not clear what is going on... I think this is a challenging book and most certainly is not a novel for somebody who is looking for a light read."
3,Black Sand,"I purchased this sand to use in a discovery bottle (items hidden in the sand that can be ""discovered"" when shifting the bottle around). It worked okay except that it coated the inside of the bottle with a thin black film."
2,The Protector that Needs Protection,"This cover looks nice for the first week, then winds up getting dented EASILY!!!!Buy if your VERY careful"
2,cheap science book,"this books detail and consice managing is good but laks interesting experiments/inventions.for kids it may be fun and get a few laughs but when it comes down to work and when it comes down to ""does it work"" it fails the test.yet this book is still two stars!"
2,"Ohhh, how cliché...","Hmmm.... Very familiar. Seems like a compilation of every drug-culture movie I've seen. It's basically a collage of ripped-off scenes and ideas. I recommend that you spend your money on something like Trainspotting instead. Same drug culture, more originality ;)."
2,Lets get serious....,"The monster of Peladon is a silly re-hash of what was not the best plot line to begin with. At least this one has Sarah in it, which made it a little more tolerable, at least for me.One thing though - I know that this is a pretty rare tape as far as Doctor Who's go, but anyone who pays NINETY_EIGHT BUCKS for this stupid episode is bloody well out of their minds.98 bucks? That mother better be signed by every Doctor that ever was. Rediculous."
4,new,"great book. good stuff. well thought out for our class. as usual, more information than can be taken in in a month and half class."
1,Akward keyboard,"I'm going to return this one. If you need an ergonomic keyboard you probably won't appreciate that the keys require an unusual amount of effort to press. The trackpad is also in the middle, which is not as natural as my old lite-on keyboard which had it under the arrow keys.This was the only usb ergonomic trackpad keyboard I could find but I think I'll just get one without a trackpad."
5,Personality Theories textbook,Item was in good condition just as described and received in a timely manner. Thank You!!! :)
1,racist trash,"A disappointing book from the author of the excellent book ""The Moorchild"", but not out of character for the times when it was originally published (1952). The main character is torn between his white side (responsible, hardworking) and his Indian side (inconsiderate, untrustworthy). You have to wonder why the publisher dredged this nauseating racist garbage up in 1986. Don't buy this poison for your kids. For more information on just how little credit Indians are given for anything and why, see Jack Weatherford's ""Indian Givers"" and Eqbal Ahmad's ""Confronting Empire""."
2,Good Bones,Cannot rview Margaret Atwood's writing because I quit reading it after the second page. There is no table of contents so you cannot select any particular story. The paragraphs are seperated by about 4 or 5 empty lines causing each page to have far less lines than it should. This was a waste of money.
3,Not much character,"Bostridge's voice is attractive, but quite small. Nothing to rave about. Many of the songs on this album are beyond his dynamic range and he doesn't quite capture the nature of the lyrics. Poor placement of the microphones also leaves much to be desired, which might have helped him in the end, had it been done well. Another typical recording of lieder. I was on the fence about buying this one, but ended up getting it at the recommendation of a friend...I would leave this one on the shelves."
4,Peter Greens comeback.,"After disappearing from the music scene in 1970, Green came back with this album in the late 70's. Although his voice is a little rough, his guitar playing was spot on. His work on ""fool no more"" is fantastic and some of the instrumentals are great.""Seven stars"" is another standout track with an explosive solo in the middle. The album has a loose and relaxed feel to it. All in all, a great comeback from one of Britans greatest blues guitarists. Two albums followed this release and then he dissappeared again until the 90's.This was definately the best of the comeback albums. There were rumors that Snowy White, the rhythm guitarist on these tracks actually played lead for Green. You decide."
2,Bad acting and lame jokes,I would love to see (Mystery science theater 3000) are (the Crew) add this to their collections are possibly someone do a complete voice over comedy of it. The little bit of skin action kind of makes up for the bad acting but the lame jokes are just that lame. In some parts this film try's to take itself too seriously and in others bad jokes and even bad banter make you roll your eye. It's worth a watch if you just need a B movie to fill the gap between A and C movies. Try to rent cheap are even better watch for free with a prime membership. Have fun with it.
2,Very amateurish projects; look like they were done by kids,"This book would have been great if it had been written for small children with help from Mommy and Daddy. However, the projects look so amateurish that I find it very hard to believe that these were intended for adults to give. IMHO, you'd be much better served with Charlotte Lyons's Mothers and Daughters crafting book, which WAS meant for mothers to make with their daughters (but would be just as appropriate for fathers and daughters, mothers and sons, grandparents and grandchildren, etc.). Some of the projects were the same, and they were done better in that one."
1,disappointing,"I was excited by the premise of this book, but was disappointed in the projects. The ideas aren't very inspiring, or attractive for that matter."
3,"Can a ""chick"" really write about Bangkok?","I enjoyed this book for the most part, especially the thinly veiled speculation about the dissapearance of Jim Thompson. The only thing that really soured me from time to time is how the male characters are written. They seem like a woman's version of a man."
4,On Old Age,"The book was needed for a Latin course at the University of Iowa. It came in good condition right before classes started. The professor chose a good piece of material, that both taught essential concepts of the language as well as provided good historical context too."
3,The Ultimate Christmas Album Volume 3,"This is a pretty good Christmas CD. Some of the songs like ""Christmas Vacation"" by Mavis Staples are not easy to find."
3,"It Has The ""Christmas Vacation"" Theme Song","I bought this album only because it has the theme song from the movie, ""Christmas Vacation"". The only other album I've found this song on is the original soundtrack, which is long out of print. The only reason I give it only three stars is because I don't care for half the other Christmas songs. That's typical for any album, though. I'm very happy with my purchase."
3,partying as an escape,"This was not quite what I expected in a book about college partying. The book is very raw in areas, I suppose under the front of ""honesty"". The author also conveys a cynicism that makes you wonder if his search for mind altered fun isn't really just a shell in which he is trying to hide. On the bright side, the book has many areas that make you laugh."
5,No Intelligent Rebuttals For This One. . .,"I've been watching the whole ID/evolution debate for several years now, and am quite impressed by David Swift's presentation in this volume: It is a top-notch showcase for normal human reasoning in address of the oft-obfuscated problems surrounding the universal application of Darwin's theory of evolution.After over 400 pages of thorough research discussion, this scientist said:""The popular perception is that increased scientific knowledge inevitably closes the gaps in our understanding, and progressively removes any need for non-natural explanations. However, biology is a clear example - perhaps it is the only example - where our increased knowledge has served to widen the gap rather than close it. Success in uncovering the molecular mechanisms of biology ... does not explain how biology (began). In fact, the more of molecular biology we uncover, the stronger does the case for (intelligent) design become.""An excellent resource for the thoughtful reader."
4,"Good, not his best","Things Falling Apart is quite interesting and Trent Reznor's cover of Metal is probably the best song on this CD. But for the most part this CD does not keep me coming back for more. Despite Metal most of the tracks, after a few listens, gets tiring. This CD is definitly not Trent Reznor's best, but compared to other Industrial artists it is very good. I think we have become to expect more from Mr. Reznor."
2,Another weak remix album,NIN has done it again with their remix albums of slightly changed versions of songs released of previous efforts in an attempt to milk the hard-core ninnies; hard to beleive i was actually one at a point...
5,"Gary Paulsen's ""Rodomonte's Revenge""","Gary Paulsen combines action, adventure, and humor into a wonderful book! Just because the book is small, it doesn't mean that the story is dumb. Give it a try!"
2,Better than nothing!,"Although this CD was extremely weak sounding as compared to the original recording, it is better than nothing at all if you truly love the music. If you get a chance to see them live, GO! Just because the album was mixed and/or produced poorly does not mean that this band has lost it's bite. I saw them on tour for this album and was amazed at the power of their live performance. It's just a shame they couldn't capture the power of their performance on this CD!"
1,"Evade, evade, evade!","Driving long distance surfing frequencies on the radio, we came across Questionmark & The Mysterians' ""96 Tears""... and to be blunt about it, it was the worst thing we ever heard! After hours of thinking, we couldn't come up with any song that was worse. This includes Bob Dylan! We're talking BAD here!Painful! Listen to the sample and find out for yourself!p.s: no offense for those of you who actually LIKE this kind of stuff, and if you do take offense, you should think about getting an opinion of your own. Perhaps finding what YOU like and DON'T like and forgetting about whatever else is being said about ""your"" music. Just a thought... PAL."
1,keep the kids waiting,Kids waited forever for a disappointment. Didn't crush ice and kept jamming. Returned immediately. Daughter and friend had to wait for me to hand shave the ice to create their frozen treat. Not a fun Christmas surprise.
5,Adorable!!!,Looks sturdy and very nostalgic!!! Just like a real efficient machine. I'm giving it to my 6 year old neice for Christmas. She'll have a lot of fun with it while sharing with her friends.
3,It's ok,I put in ice from my refrigerator and it chops it up but no better than any blender. I was hoping for real light flaky ice. Still it's not bad just not what I hoped for.
4,My daughter loves it,So far it works very well. We've only had it for a few months. My daughter loves it. It seems to be just as I expected it to be.
5,Snow cone machine,Have bought several snow cone machines in the past this one by far is the best. Easy to use and clean. Would recommend.
4,trash heaven,"Anyone who expects to see a balanced political view is in for a big disappointment but fans of bad made-for-TV bios will be in hog heaven. James Brolin is a dead-on as the clueless Reagan, although his performance and make-up are just this side of a marathon SNL skit. Judy Davis, meanwhile, doesn't look much like his calculating wife (the movie should have been called ""Nancy Dearest"") but nevertheless steals the show by suggesting what would have happened if Judy Garland had been cast in the Angela Lansbury role in ""The Manchurian Candidate."" This one gets my vote!"
1,Should Have never been made...,"I have never seen this movie, and never plan to. May President Reagan rest in peace. Was this movie based on Donald Regan's book (him and Nancy never got along). People thought Nancy was there for the fame and lime-light. But when President Reagan revealed that he had Alzheimer's and went into seclusion, Mrs. Reagan went with her husband because she truly loves him. Like him or not, Reagan was a great man and he doesn't deserve this smear-job."
5,These Chants Rock,As a yoga instructor and massage therapist I cannot get enough of this CD. If you are into devotional chanting I urge you to listen to The Love Window. Benjy's remarkable talent and Heather's ethereal voice are a true inspiration.
2,rarified parenting,"If I were a freelance, watercoloring, ex-Yalie, who enjoyed endlessly sitting in cafes and name dropping when I wasn't eating at expensive restaurants perhaps I could find something compelling in this overly sentimental memoir. The author is rather smarmy and self-congratulatory even when he thinks he's being self-deprecatory.I wasn't sure why I was supposed to sympathise with apparent tragedies like there being no more blueberry scones at the coffe shop that he seemed to live at. I felt Mr. Cooper's love for his child to be deep and sincere and his worries and joys of parenting to be honest but a book of any real interest this is not.This recent overbearing need for parents to tell these warts and all stories of childrearing is becoming tiresome to say the least."
3,Good but only 20 projects offered,"So far I have made four of the projects in this book: a candle holder, a plate, a picture frame, and a candle sconce. There was room for improvement on my part with the candle holder, but everything else came out pretty much the way it should have according to the book. The photos that accompany each instructional step really have with projects such as these. There is also a pictoral index of the ingredients and supplies needed to complete the projects introduced. I love working with salt dough and have been giving dough ornaments as creative (and terribly cheap) Christmas gifts for two years. This book is a great beginners book for the novice artist looking to tackle a new medium to work with. It's VERY fun."
4,"Solid writing, good plot and interesting speculations","A surprisingly good read dealing with a fairly depressing end of the world scenario. The adventure of the explorers stranded on planet ""Deepsix"" forms the core of the story, with plenty of support given to the innovative rescue efforts. In truth, the most fascinating topics are archaeological- dealing with the intelligent species that lived on the planet.The final revelations are somewhat unexpected and well thought out. Jack McDevitt always delivers in this aspect.Definitely worth reading, and sure to keep you thinking long after you close its pages. Solid writing, good plot and interesting speculations make for a most satisfying read."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"This is another Priscilla Hutchins novel. She had previously discovered the existence of the Monument Makers and a probably location for their homeworld.This is more of a rescue mission book, as an orginal Deepsix mission gets into trouble with dangerous alien lifeforms, and then again, when Hutchins is involved another pull out is needed.The planet is of interest because of signs of past life that had not been noticed before."
1,As advertised on Glenn Beck,"I understand that Oreck is still advertising on Glenn Beck's show. The handle on mine broke off. They fixed it, but the bag is ripped. It came with headphones for a radio that you could never get in tune. Now, it will be $120 to repair it...or just go to Target and buy a similarly priced vacuum that will do the same trick."
1,"Missing screens, typos... it's a first edition!","Why anyone would use a book like this in a first edition when so many other books are on the market that are *not* first editions is beyond me. It is riddled with typos and mistakes, and misses many key screens. I found the examples hard to follow, and the end of chapter material, while voluminous, is very superficial. This is not a very good book, even though it may appear to be at first glance."
5,Does the job!,"I used this on my cats before taking them to their first cat show. I heated it first, and the result was great. My cats never looked better. I would definitely recommend this to anyone else."
1,I wish,"Man I wished it actually did something for my truck, it was cheap and I got it fast but that's the only thing I can say good about it. Save your money, absolutely no change when added to a diesel engine!!!"
4,Great field guide to everything in the Keys,"This is a great field and tour guide for the natural world of the Florida Keys. It covers places to go, the plants and animals you may see on land as well as the fish and seaweed in the sea. If you only get one book about the Keys, get this one."
1,Zero Stars not an Option,"I based my purchase of this book on the cover. It looked as though it would have been a well designed and beautifully executed book. I expected the high quality pictures that usually accompany guide books of this type...which I have shelves and shelves of because I am an avid traveler. This book is horrible quality and not worth the paper it is printed on. I wish I could review on the content but I couldn't get past the fact that it looked like it was made using an old Xerox machine. Even if it is overflowing with useful information, I wouldn't pay more than $6 for it."
3,A little rough,"We used this guide for our last trip to Red Rocks. The quality of the images and editing are sub-par and the descriptions are rather haphazard. The writing drove my wife nuts (she is an english major) with its errors and tortured formations.The approach info is OK and it eventually got us to the walls we were looking for. Route grading seems accurate. The topos were rough, but usable."
5,An unsurpassable performance,"This recording of Francesco Maria Veracini's orchestral concerti is yet another of Reinhard Goebel's and Musica Antiqua Köln's outstanding performances of the music of the Dresden Court. The effect a period-instrument performance has on the quality of the recording can only be described as ""electrifying"". Veracini combines good Dresden solidity with wisping, virtuosic Italian brio and gusto. A true fiery rival for the stale, traditional repertoire of Vivaldi, Bach, and Handel. Another marvellous, incredible feat to the honorable credit of the performers and a genuine gift to the friends of music. END"
2,Buy for the photos only....,"It's unfortunate that Ms. Rinfret doesn't write as well as she designs. The photos of her work (and her work) are excellent, but the text is sophomoric at best. The number of self-aggrandizing ""I"" statements led me to abandon reading midway through the second chapter and just peruse the photos - which is the only reason to buy this book."
3,"Oops in ""Bell Haven""","I would have liked more photos of the exteriors to really capture that Greenwich style, but worse is the misspelling of ""Belle Haven,"" the most exclusive area in town. That made the whole book less so."
3,Being critical,"The book condition was fine. I ordered the book from a photo I saw on a blog. In the book,the exteriorshots of the houses were quality, but I, personally, felt the design quality was ho-hum. I can appreciatesafe decorating that pleases the client, but it is just not my cup of tea."
1,Piece of Junk,"Just got this item today.All kinds of problems:-Speaker phone does not work.-Time on LCD screen not the same as voice time.-Recorded outgoing message sounds staticy and poor to incoming callers.-Does not actually ring when there's an incoming call, even when the ring volume is set to high.This is a piece of junk. I'm not sure if Coby has ever mad a good product but this one is certainly not it. Avoid Coby and their cheap products."
1,Callers...Beware!,"I hate this phone. I have it at my desk at work and it switches to speakerphone without notice and when this happens the speakerphone light doesn't even go on. I actually thought that this was an isolated problem and switched it out with the same phone at an empty desk. Low and behold....it happened again. Also, the sound quality is horrible and my callers can never hear me without me having to speak loudly, No matter the volume level. It's weird because this phone USED to work for me, but I guess if you have it for more then 2 months...you're outta luck.Bottom line....cheap phone...you get what you pay for!"
3,A Lukewarm Reaction,"I have mixed feelings about this work because of its strange combination. While I feel it to be a fairly good background on some of the basics, with sound folklore and scholarly background, my problems with this book stem from the fact that all of the ritual practices follow the four element ritual spread common to Wicca, when there is next to no evidence to support that this is what the druids actually did. Thankfully, the author does not imply that these practices are authentic, and even informs the reader that he will be borrowing from several sources. Still, many readers who cannot make the same connection on their own are going to believe that this is true and authentic practice of the Celtic Druids. A more scholarly work, such as ""The Druids"" by Peter Berresford Ellis, would shed some light on what is known about the Druids, and what is simply inferred."
1,Musicality of this group is poor to fair.,"This CD sucks. ""I Do My Balling in the Bathroom"" is the high point along with the title song. The subject matter may interest some for shock value only, but over all this is not an album for those who are looking for good lyrics or easy listening."
4,Looking for the rest of it.,"I have on complants here, Real good picture and sound, I would like to have bought the other two or so seasons of it as well Hope they come soon"
5,5th grade and Middle School Dictionary,"The dictionary has easy to understand definitions. My son has had to use an adult level dictionary to look up some words from 5th grade advanced vocabulary that were not in this one, but perhaps that is to be expected."
5,An entirely excellent book,"Of all the books I have purchased for my daughter, the entire Clay Carmichael ""Bear"" books are likely my favourite. This true story is an emotional tale told from the viewpoint of the stuffed bear. It is absolutely perfect in tone and delivery for 4-7 yr olds and beyond.Bear feels worn out and looks the part compared to other animals so he begins the process of avoiding anything that will make him ""more worn out"" out of fear of being tossed out as rubbish. His owner surprises him by making him a bear suit to wear, so she can hug him all night and not wear him out. This perfectly parallels a problem we have for my daughter and her stuffed cat. (Said cat now has a cat suit a la Bear, so she will not wear out!) Any parent facing this scenario with a well-loved object of their child's affection, will want this book and idea to preserve the critter and share the story of the security that we all crave."
4,80'smetal fan,"I was a college soph in the fall of '85, tough time for metal/rock fans, VH had just called it quits and we had wade through hours of Springsteen, Dire Straits and Talking Heads on the Radio or MTV to hear one Motley of Ratt song, salvation was still about 18 months away in the form of ""Appetite for Destruction"". Anyway ""Rescue Me"" was a good, solid, overlooked rock album. It is difficult to believe once upon a time MTV Actually aired JLT Videos But it is true. While we are on the topic of under the radar 80's music, do yourself a favor and hunt for a band called ICON S/T and NIGHT OF THE CRIME. Excellent melodic hard rock, Really good at what they were trying to do. Kind of a blend of Ratt and Skid Row NOTC is one of my favorite records of all-time. My objectivity could be clouded by nostalgia, But listen for yourself"
5,We are indebted to Callas,"To start things off, I am a Sills fan who acknowledges greatness. And boy is this Lucia great! True, it's a live recording, but these flaws in my opinion, are easily overcome by the dynamite acting courtesy of La Divina. And again, she may not have the vocal resources of Sills and Sutherland, but she DOES have a great technique. I've heard high D's from her before, and they are solid! Plus, she makes this role very dramatically entertaining! Callas made this a dramatic vehicle, so both Sills and Sutherland are actually indebted to her. I do not have perfect pitch, so fortunately I'm not as bothered by the slight tone inaccuracies that another reviewer pointed out."
5,An operatic wonder,"This is the best performance I have ever heard of any opera together with Rossini's L'Assedio di Corinto, with Beverly Sills, live from La Scala 1969. Lucia di Lammermoor in the live version with Karajan in Berlin is nothing but a wonder. All sings as this was their last possibility to perform in an opera and they give all they possibly can. My God, what intensity and verve! It's very moving indeed to read in a biography of Callas that she - after this performance - went to her hotel room and in her loneliness cried, as she thought she had failed. She most certainly had not. She had made a miracle come through."
3,REA review,"Good book, the history section is too detailed, be sure to know the vocabulary lists thoroughly, they are easy points. The exam is tough but do not panic the results are usually better than you would think."
5,A Revelation - Not A Revolution,"Forget all the prissy arguments over period instruments: this recording is a revelation not a revolution.Listen to the interpretation and the performance. This is a masterful rendering of a masterpiece.Wake up your ears and your mind and treat your soul. Take a few minutes out of your life and listen to the excerpts above and prepare yourself for an insightful revelation.Then add this disc to your collection. This one is well worth the price. It is an informed, studied and above all, a genuinely alive, vibrant, intelligent, moving performance by all of the forces.First class."
2,Below usual standard,"I like the C. Muffin series, but this book does not live up to the usual standard where there is very little violence and a lot of outsmarting each other.In this book there is more violence than usual, torture even which I personally find unnecessary and somewhat tasteless.Also, the description of Charlie's smarts seems postulated as if the author has tired with it and believes that since reader already knows how smart Charlie is, he doesn't need to come up with story lines that support it."
5,Great....,"Originally, I didn't really care for Lenny, but I grew to appreciate his work....Glad I have added this to my collection!"
1,this is a crock,"to put out a greatest hits cd like this and slap a piece of garbage song on it like ""again."" who let bryan adams take over lenny's body?the rest of the songs on this cd are great, but if you buy this cd, you are a putz. this is hardly a selection of his best stuff. get the original albums."
2,dissapointed at this compilation,"i'm sorry but this is just a brief reminder of his talents lennys best songs had never been release as a single ,this greates hits is most radio play and if you want to know how good he really is just buy all his cds instead there are at least 40 songs that i could easyly name as his best"
1,Outrageous.,"I cant understand why sometimes people need to consume this kind of bad art.Lenny is ,1-A mediocre instrumentist,2-A mediocre composer,3-and a mediocre vocalist,He is that kind of guy that needs to be arrogant to hide his selfindugence.Lenny go to do another thing Music is not your way,maybe his mother said to him that he is a good musician ,and he belived .Take a listening on Fly away for example,he copied the lirycs of Elton John in Skyline Pigeon,this is ridiculous,and the music is structuraly talking very poor,Lenny leave us alone ,please."
2,this guy's a bum,"why do i say kravitz is a bum?: 1) very bad musicianship, he doesn't play guitar better than someone with 6 months training; 2) unoriginal compositions which ""borrow"" heavily from others; 3) he's a big phoney that's more interested in looking like a rock star than making good music.don't buy this stuff, you're only supporting more bad music from the record labels. and that's something none of us need.just my opinion."
5,About Time,"I have never really been a big fan of Lenny's albums as i think that they containing too many weak tracks, but i jumped at the oppurtunity to buy this album. Lenny knows how to write great singles so this album contains everything that i wanted, all the hits without having to shell out loads of money with the chance of being dissapointed. This album has not dissapointed me it is fantastic. Featuring the hit singles Again, Are Yuo Gonna Go My Way, It Aint Over, Black Velveteen and the Uk number one Fly away. This album will appeal to all fans of Lenny Kravitz and may even attract new ones"
3,Not Bad,"It's alright. The CD has it's ups and downs. Hardcore Lenny fans will love it. Some of the songs sound alike but..well it's ok. I don't regret buying the CD. My faves are ""fly away"" ""american women"" and ""again."""
5,A another breath-taking Lenny Kravitz CD!,"This time around, however, Lenny puts together a greatest hits record and it will be breath-taking all over again when you listen to it!"
2,"Okay, if you're into repetition","Personally, I don't own this album and would never condone actually shelling out the cash for an album as simple as this, but if you like standard modern pop/rock, this is one of the better choices out there. His earlier stuff is clearly where his strengths lie, and until Kravitz gets out of this string of stuff that has absolutely failed (his cover of American Woman is abyssmal, and while Fly Away rocks, a lot of the other songs off that album were repetitive and dull, not to mention the horribly bland Again which really makes you wonder why it is on any album at all), I suggest biding your time with those earlier albums, if any of his stuff at all. His songs really don't develop much beyond the standard verse/chorus blah of pop, and his guitar prowess (which I do question) is certainly not a focal point of this album in any way."
5,Every little one needs one!,This toy grows with your little one. It is super! The activity center is educational and fun. The price is great for a product that can change with your child's needs.
5,hard to explain,"This book is a true story and it says so in the authors note. This book is very sad, interesting, and violent. It is about a 16 year old boy who heard of a shooting war. His name was Charley. He wanted to enlist for the army but they said that you must be 18 to go and enlist for the army that would take place in the shooting war. Charley lies about his age and gets in without question. He gets training and fights in the army and in the battles he fought in he learns what it really is like to be in the army. He learned that you always think you're going to die. He learned that if someone is having a slow and painful death because of a wound they will want to shoot themselves. Charley learned a lot in the army and that is why this book is called soldiers heart. My favorite part is the whole book because it is so interesting and sad. I don't have a least favorite part. This book is good for people that like stories that can show them a lesson."
4,Soldier's Heart,Soldier's Heart is a book that is about a boy that is father was killed by a horse. He is going off to war to become a man and too earn money and see what the real world is about. He is only 15 but tells the men that he is 18. He has falling in love over a dozen of time when the girls would give each man something to eat on their way down south. He try to help people but is not able to. He dies and before he dies he think about his life.
3,Soldier's Heart Gary Paulsen,Soldier's heart by Gary Paulsen is about a young man named Charley Goodard who wants to go to war so he fakes his age and enlists in the war. He goes to war and through out the battles he keeps thinking he will die. I think this book is an alright book. Some parts are really good and some are not. I rate this book an 8 out of 10.
2,Soldier's Heart,"Charley Goddard is going to go into the Civil War, but when he gets there it isn't what he expected. I think that this book was too simple for me, which is probably why I didn't like it all that much. But for an elementary student, I think it would be really interesting."
2,Gary Paulsen wrote this?,"Having grown up with Hatchet - after reading Soldier's Heart, I couldn't believe Gary Paulsen had written this book. I enjoy him immensely as an author but couldn't finish this book as I just couldn't get into it enough to stay interested...sigh."
5,Soldier's Heart by Gary Paulsen,I purchased this book as a gift for my granddaughter. It was on her 8th grade book list of required reading. She enjoyed it very much.
4,Great!,"Soldier's Heart is placed in the Civil War. A boy, Charlie, fights for the Yankees or the Union. He goes and fights he witnesses things a young boy should not witness. Charlie went through 6 years of hell. A person should read this book because this book is full action and the action is non-stop."
5,soldier's Heart sole my heart,SOLDIER'S HEARTSoldier's Heart is about a kid named Charley he was 15 years old .He went to Fort Summter and signed up. He was in the Civil War.I think Gary Paulsen is trying to show us that war is all about and to teach us war is not cool or fun.I liked the whole book but my favorite parts were when two bullets headed for his head but they hit each other and fell. I also liked when a canon ball went though a horse and it did flips. I liked the end because it's peaceful. If you want to find out what happens red it you will love it.
3,"Interest, but only interesting...","A short read about a young man seeking adventure and excitement. Going into a war he thinks nothing big will happen but why miss a chance like this? He soon finds out he was wrong, DEAD wrong. His life soon turns into a nightmare of death and a struggle to survive the savage rebel attacks.Quickly having to adapt to this new chaotic world he finds himself in, he slowly turns from a loving young man seeking adventure to a beast trying to survive. This is a book of action and survival and not a bad read."
5,A Great Depiction of the Civil War,"The book ""Soldiers Heart"" is the best way of showing what the Civil War was like. No textbook or school teacher can show you this kind of realism. This book makes you believe you are actually in this story. Its a great story about a boy who gets in the army and follows him through the battles and after the war. It's a terrific book. I would definatly recommend this book because i know a good book when i see one."
5,Powerful!,"Soldier's Heart is a powerful story about 15 year old Charley Goodard and his experience as a soldier in the Civil War. A major theme throughout this novel is the horror of war. Gary Paulsen allows readers into this horror with the descriptive details that he provides--every moment, readers are able to see and feel what Charley is experiencing. Readers witness the traumatic changes Charley goes through during the war. When Charley leaves for war, he is excited and ready to fight. When he returns home he is in constant pain and looking forward to his own death. Gary Paulsen uses true events to help readers understand the brutality of war, which will assist junior high and high school students, who are studying the Civil War, to gain a vivid picture of the details of each battle. This is a novel that will not be forgotten!"
3,Not what I thought,"I thought I was getting a CD with equal songs by Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn. Unfortunately, it was mostly Loretta Lynn, which is fine, but not what I thought."
4,AN ELABORATION.,"I have been asked to elaborate on my earlier review of this recording. The ""Five Greatest Traviatas on Record"" are: 1.Callas 2. Caballe 3.Sills 4.Sutherland(with Bergonzi) 5.Ponselle(live from the Met,1935) unfortunately out of print."
2,Big Disappointment,"Let first start by saying that the rating is shown as X. Well in all honesty, this film is probably equivilant to an R rated film. The sex and nudity is muted, particularly the sex. This came out of Munich Germany. There were others that came out of Munich about the same time that were much better. They may have come from the same studio, I really don't remember. Three come to mind, ""Girls Who Love Girls"", ""Six Swedes On Campus"" and ""Six Swedes on a Pump"". These were all German sex comedies andwere pretty good. There were others of the same type probably from the same studios. This was not one of the better ones. If you are curious, youwould be better off renting it if you can find it. Charlie S."
2,Why is Gardiner so accaimed by critics?,"I saw Gardiner lead his orchestra in these two masterworks last week. Little has changedin the ensuing years and I fully agree with the comments by dv. Mostly superficial, if well played with good ensemble. Gardiner had me thinking of original instruments under his baton as a bit of a gimmick. He did at least wake up to lead a powerful rendition of the finale of the 5th. With regard to the inane liner notes by David Hurwitz, this ass has no business being taken seriously as a critic. His notes for this CD are sensible compared to something he wrote on his online site several years ago: that Bach and Handel would have favored abortion and a woman's right to choose. I kid you not. Actually there is a consistency between the two: both show Hurwitz does not respect classical music."
3,NOT THE BEST,"I prefer Karajan's version (ASIN: B00000630V), i think there he had his best moments. Maria created with that recording a School of singing."
5,Callas not having the drama?,I can only laugh at such ignorant lies! Callas was known to be the most dramatic Lucia ever! And her coloratura is great!
4,Benise...an artist with a world view of music,"I very much enjoyed the Nights of Fire CD and seeing Benise in concert live recently. The music flows from one country to another, each flavor different but similar and Benise weaves his musical story throughout. If you are a fan of flamenco guitar I would highly recommend this CD and his others. You will not be disappointed and soon you'll be waiting for Benise to visit your city or town because seeing him live is the ultimate icing on the cake!"
5,great,loves magic school bus movies and books; ordered this per son's request for Christmas and wasn't disappointed. great quality for learning and fun entertainment
5,Fun & Educational,I love the Magic School Bus series. It teaches Science in a fun & educationalmanner.
2,NOT MAC compatible,"I'm annoyed that it was not clearly listed in the description for this product. Purchased it for my little nephew so that he could play it on his parents' Mac computer, although it will hopefully work on their TV. This information should be clearly stated in the product description. My comments are not directed toward the quality of the content, as I have not seen it."
