5,Mathematical Methods For Physicists,I bought this book to help me advance my knowledge of physics math beyond two books I will soon be studying carefully. This book is good for the advancement of knowledge in physics math.
2,An oversized APPENDIX rather than a useful text!,"This book was used as a text for an advanced undergraduate/1st year graduate course. Unfortunately, this work is becoming the classic text for such courses. The text is too concise to be useful for most students at this level. However, it may serve as a good reference book for those who have already learned the material. Good luck to those trying to learn it for the first time! The book is loaded with oversimplified examples of tough concepts and then leaves the difficult problems AS AN EXERCISE FOR THE READER. You will definitely need a supplemental text or two! Try Mathematical Physics by Eugene Butkov for a more thorough treatment of the concepts."
2,"A decent reference, mostly for its large glossy text","This book is pretty encyclopedic, and is quite easy to look at, but please to not attempt to actually LEARN from this book. Some of the sections are good, but many are shamefully terrible, such as the treatment of complex variables or Green's functions. Overall, the book just seems sloppily thrown together. The quick-reference equations in the front and back, for instance, are conspicuously mis-indented and mis-aligned. Really a shame, because his book has a lot of potential. As an alternative, I would recommend the cheap paperback by Dennery, which, though slightly less comprehensive, is much more consistent."
1,Not the optimal means to master mathematical physics,"This was the book used for a graduate level mathematical physics course at the University of Houston. Yes, with enough time you can learn the concepts from this book. But I found it far more efficient to check out half a dozen different books on the individual topics: complex analysis, advanced diff. eqns, group theory, vector analysis and others. The elaboration saved me alot of time. The time saved I used to work additional problems in Arfken. The problems in Arfken are very helpful."
2,The Humdrum Guide to XXX Anime,"While this book provides detailed coverage of much of the dark side of anime, it is marred by very lackluster writing and a dearth of illustration. The writers shift back and forth from a dry academic philosophizing which sometimes borders on apologising for Japanese tastes to an equally dry reporting of film contents. This should be a fascinating subject. The Japanese have focused considerable writing, illustrative and musical talent on sexually oriented anime, and this strange little book seems to want to downplay all of that. Hopefully someone else will be inspired to create the book this should have been."
1,Boring,Stand in the Wind is really a boring book! It really wasted my time. I couldn't help skipping pages. Don't read this book!
2,Cell phone holder,"Nice, but after approximately 6 months of everyday use, the metal that is beneath the black material on the part that hooks over your belt/waistband cuts through the material and pokes you in the side."
1,Falls apart after washing.,"After washing this by hand (per the instructions) the inner lining of the mask is peeling off. The material underneath the lining is irritating to my skin, so after it finishes coming off, the sleep mask will be useless. It also lets light in around the nose."
1,RIPS your hair out - NOT for women,"This product is NOT for women; which is funny because they all have a feminine design. If the velcro touches your hair it will stick to it and God forbid your hair get tangled up in it during the night. I wore this one night and one night only. Terrible design, terrible purchase. What were they thinking? The person who designed this either has no hair or sleeps standing up."
2,too warm and hurts ears,"I saw all the great reviews so i got them . The one strap digs into my ear and I wake up with sore ear on the top ridge of my ear . i dont wear them to tight either . 2 thinner velcro straps would be better , one for your upper head and the lower one for under your ears/ lower head ."
2,Cheaply-Made Product,"When I received the item, it was apparent that it was a cheaply made product. I now understand what others have said about the velcro joining the two strips in the back of the head. It'll create a bump where the strips overlap and I'm not sure how comfortable it'll be. I have not used this item yet, but will be taking a 5-hour red-eye flight and connecting to a 6-hour flight this Saturday. I'll see how it goes."
3,Very Comfortable but Not So Durable,"I bought my first one of these about a year ago to help block out the light when I had to work at night. These are very very comfortable because unlike other eye masks they do not put any pressure on your eyes and are very lightweight. However, about 6 months after everyday use (always at home, very gently used) they started to fray at the edges.I bought another pair because I really liked how comfortable they were but the foam padding completely separated from the eye mask in less than 2 months of use.I tried a few other different brands which were much more durable however they all put too much pressure on my eyes which I found very uncomfortable. So I finally broke down and bought my third one of these in a year a month ago. It's still in excellent condition but time will tell.5 stars for comfort, 2 stars for durability (3 pairs in 1 year!!)"
2,"Was good for about two weeks, then...","Top comments you see here are all correct - they let light in around the nose for sure, and the velcro strap is super uncomfortable behind your head. Also, if you leave some of the velcro strap exposed at either end it sticks to your pillow so you basically have to wear it at one length and completely loose the usefulness of the strap.Last bad thing: SEE THE SECOND PICTURE AT THE TOP WHERE THE BACK LINING CAME OFF. THAT HAPPENED TO MINE TOO, AFTER ONLY A FEW WEEKS. So dissapointing.Those bad things being said they are very light and nice otherwise. I never think they are that bad while I wear them as I fall asleep but my body hates them so much that I literally wake up every morning and I have tossed them on the ground next to the bed in my sleep."
2,"Hmm, this product WAS great.","Okay, I'm giving this product two stars instead of one because it was the best eye mask ever unntil it started falling apart. The lining eventually peels apart from the foam. I still wear mine even with the flopping lining, but I am in need of a new mask now. Bummer because the product is EXCELLENT until the lining starts peeling. :("
5,Snuggle up and start reading!,"I love it, I love it, I love it! I thought that Jude Deveraux's story was the best. Save it for last! If you read Judith McNaught's story, be sure to read 'Remember When'"
5,Outstanding photography with easy to read descriptions.,This book is an excellent reference book for Florida trees. The photography is absolutely beautiful. It allows the reader to easily identify a tree and then read about it as a layman or a more advanced horticulturist.I believe it is a must buy for newcomers to Florida as well as anyone interested in flowering trees in the south.A must for your Florida flora collection.
2,Was missing the song I wanted.,"I purchased this sound track because because of a particular song which I didn't know the name to. I thought it would be in the soundtrack but no it wasn't. I did even hear samples of the songs but was confused by the Balloon Escape song, I thought that was the song I was looking for. I now know it's Lou Reed's song called ""Rouge"" on his Ecstasy album. The other cuban sounding songs are pretty cool actually but I don't really listen to it. You should get this if you are mainly interested in the cuban music (that's what I""m calling it) that is played in the movie."
3,Dated Homiletics Book,"This book was the classic text for homiletic in the nineteenth century. It is interesting as a study of what preachers were being taught about preaching back then, and one can glean nuggets of wisdom, but otherwise it's a rather ponderous read. The author has a section on rhetoric that is especially helpful, even for modern preachers, who could learn a thing about the basics of communication from it. Given the almost absolute dearth of books out there that actually talk about how to actually write and preach an good sermon, this is still not a bad choice for the preacher who wants to improve at his craft."
4,Good Read,"Mrs. Keckley presents her life as well as those around her duringthe era of slavery and post slavery. Her accounts of Mrs. Lincolnare documented in other of my readings on Mrs. Lincoln. She presentsa moving account of her loyalty to the First Lady during and afterthe years in the White House.L.Meyerle, CTAmazon Verified"
4,Interesting and inspirational,"I very much enjoyed this book. I thought the descriptions and tone the author used made you fel you were right there. I thought it was very gracious that Ms. Keckley was very kind in her dipiction of Mrs Lincoln and shed light on why she was such a demanding person, due to her priveleged childhood. The author makes one understand the mental anguish that Mrs Lincoln suffered and the embarrasment she endured after the president was shot. I recommend this book"
4,Lincoln movie plus next must read,After I left the Lincoln movie I was driven to learn more about the relationship of Abe and his wife Mary. My interest was piqued after learning her seamstress free slave Elizabeth wrote a tell all book about her time in the White House. The icing on the cake was to learn Lincoln's son Robert burned all the books he could find. Hooray to Amazon for having copies.
3,So So,"Not much to hold my attention..only finished half before it put me to sleep..Maybe you'll like it, It was missing something."
2,LOUSY !!!!!!!!!!!,"This book was VERY,VERY DISAPPOINTING!It had only 2 chapters on 30yrs.of being a SLAVE(if you can believe that!) and 13 CHAPTERSon 4 yrs. in the White House!!GO FIGURE!!!!! I am SO SORRY I had my daughter get this book for me for Mother's DAY!"
3,Great first hand account,"I recently came across a book simply called ""Mary"" about Mary Todd Lincoln. It is written as if Mary wrote it herself and I was enthralled with her life and what she endured as a woman of her time. It references Mary noticing this book by Mrs Keckley in the window of a bookstore and her reaction to it. When I found it free on my kindle I had to read it to put it all in context and was not disappointed."
3,Interesting but scattered,"As a confidant of Mary Todd Lincoln, Elizabeth keckley had close assess to the White House during Lincoln's time in office. A former slave she would eventually buy her freedom and settle in Washington. A dressmaker she would be hired by many prominent politicians wife's including Jefferson Davis. The book is somewhat scattered and quite short but does shed light on the rather tragic life of Mary Todd after her husbands death.Interesting detail is shared on her attempts to raise funds by selling her clothes. Todd was furious at this publication, in particular, letters written between them. Definitely worth reading for any Lincoln buff looking for some new information."
3,Repetitious,"Too much exactly like Mrs. Lincoln's Dressmaker. It was o.k. but if I had known then what I know now, I could not have bought it."
1,"NOT DIAMOND , DO NOT BUY","I BOUGHT THIS WATCH I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I TAKE IT TO JEWLLERY SHOP TO EXAMINE IF ITS REAL DIAMOND ,IT WASNT , ITS COMPLETLY NON REAL , HE SAID ITS ZARAKON STONES , AND EVEN THE BERCELT COLOR WILL CHANGE IN FEW MONTHS. IT WAS A VERY LIGHT WEIGHT WATCH LIKE THE VERY CHEAP CHINES WATCH COPIES"
5,great light,Have had light a couple weeks now and it works great. Other LEDs that I have had go bad within a few weeks due to bouncing in pocket. This one is holding up real well. Good bright light.
5,"how bout deez guyz,eh?","if you like this,you'll like cornbugs too.this would be the cd for people to start with because it's the most pop-oriented of the prax's-the tunes are catchy as hell!then get ""metatrom""if you're impressed.I describe praxis and the other ""funk-weirdo"" projects as funk/ambient/hip-hop/dj/new age/metal(death+regular)/fusion/dub/comedy/and pretty much anything else a tripper could ask from santa for christmas!it's soul food in it's heartiest form."
2,It is Boring,This game is not worth your money. The controls are slow it does not always do what you tell it to. Ok it is fun beating up the guys but dont buy it. If you want get the demo. Any real PC gamer will know what I am saying is true
4,A Great Kids Halloween Book,"The Witch Has an Itch is a terrific kids book for Halloween. It isn't scary and there is no blood and guts and actually has a moral - type ending. The witch likes to do mean things and when she does, different parts of her body itch until she realizes that she should make good ,not bad. It is a nice repetative book and lends itself to many language activities."
5,Beautiful!,"Philadelphia has a bad habit of ripping down its historic buildings. Preservation of history is never on our council's mind.Some of the most interesting historic places in Philadelphia are the cemeteries and the churches. This book highlights the churches, and, by extension, many of the burial grounds.All religions are represented. And, because the Quakers were more accepting than others at the time, there are more religions to represent here than one would imagine.The text is informative. The pictures are beautiful.Pick one up and enjoy it!!(*)>"
1,What an anorak!,"Mr. Moss seems to be an anorak, as this book seems to be poorly researched and contains many factual mistakes. He also implies that we should go and visit these churches just for their value as a building, which is quite silly. Churches are for worship and not museums. I for one am not going to bother people trying to worship just to look at the inside of a building!If there was an option for no stars I would give it."
4,Schwager covers a whole lot of material,"Very comprehensive book. Much if it is difficult to understand. Excellent writing, the clearest in the business, but author gets into some complex info. I feel he is not always fair in giving credit to other authors.One side issue, a book this costly and technical should have a durable binding. Mine fell apart the first time I opened it. It's glued together like a paperback novel.All in all it's the most complete single source I have seen in the commodities trading field, even includes chapters on economic theory. It's worth the price. Info on fallacies in fundamental analysis (reading the news) is unique and helpful. Also lots of very wise trading tips"
3,Oily residue,"Not sure if it is normal, but these leave a bit of an oily residue in my whipped cream canister. A little cause for concern."
1,would not buy again,"while i suppose this is a form of history, it is boring in the extreme. why i bought it was the title-got disappointed. if i were her grandchild, would not really want to know all this."
3,A good cast but an okay western,"The story of the Pony Express riders and the obstacles they faced is the story here. This picture was Charlton Heston's second western and in spite of good casting, some fine action scenes and beautiful color, the film was okay but nothing special. The script is sprinkled with several light moments that clash with the more serious plots of Indian uprisings and sinister white men who don't want the express riders to succeed and unite the young country from coast to coast. There is good chemistry between Heston and Forrest Tucker but Heston's romance, such as it is, with Rhonda Fleming is corny. Henry Brandon, Pat Hogan and Richard Shannon are good in minor plot roles."
4,Pony Express,I enjoyed the movie and feel it is a classic western. Charlton Heston was superb in the role he played and it was very exciting.
2,okay but fake,This CD represents a westerners wet dream look at Gnawa music. It has little to do with hardcore Gnawa
1,are you serious?,charging $33 for a poorly written book that is not new; that can be purchased new for $6 elsewhere is robbery. shame on you
5,Excelente,"Necesitamos actuar rápido antes los cambios y quizas antes que estos sucedan....no tengas miedo....si necesitas inspiración lee este libro de inmediato, te aseguro que te gustará y te hará reflexionar."
3,Que hacer ante el cambio,"Quizas ha sido el libro que más rápido he leido y el que más me ha afectado mi vida, me ha enseñado que debo hacer cuando las cosas cambian... todo el que necesite saber que hacer ante los cambios debe leer este libro. Lo recomiendo ampliamente"
5,beautiful,george winston can calm anyone down great music to relax i recommend it for commuters and new parents and anyone trying to be romantic
1,"Beware, BOOTLEG version","This version is a Red Sun bootleg, buy the newly remastered ""Sword Masters"" edition and support legit Shaw Brothers releases."
5,"A dear, sweet book about being happy with what you have","This is a dear, sweet book about being happy with what you have. ""The Birthday Presents"" is Paul Stewart's short but sweet tale about two pals, a rabbit and a hedgehog, and how they go about trying their darndest to pick the most wonderful possible birthday gifts for each other.Deciding that Rabbit's hole is just a mite dark, Hedgehog bottles up a bunch of moonlight. Simultaneously, Rabbit worries that Hedgehog might be bothered by the sunlight while sleeping out in the open--so he packs up a mossy box of darkness. Of course the pals are disappointed when they open their gifts, but they later figure out on their own the good wishes behind each gift--and the best way to put the gifts to real, everyday use.Any small child can begin to learn from this book the secret of choosing to be happy with what you have, instead of worrying about what you don't have, and parents and kids alike will get a kick out of Chris Riddell's vivid illustrations."
2,Way Overrated for this Judy Fan,"I wasn't pleased. I bought two. One was for a gift, after I'd read a write-up in a magazine praising the album. I didn't give the other and donated both to a charitable resale shop."
3,Good listen,"Considering how old this recording is, it is a must-have for any Garland fan. My mom was a huge fan and I grew up listening to this classic 40s-50s voice. For any singer, live performances should be better than studio, and this does not disappoint."
2,Ah memories!,"I remember listening to this album in college in the 60's. It wowed me then. Not now. It seems so un-rehearsed. So many pauses for the band to come upstage, for Judy to determine what the next song is, etc etc. Disappointing. Shouldn't mess with great memories, I guess."
1,Out of Date material,This book is out of date and is not suitable for the current PMP certification.
1,Watch Out!!!,"I'd be real careful before purchasing this book. I found lots of errors in the book, which really hindered my ability to study, as you kept going back to double check things. Worse yet, it left you feeling unsure about what you really knew - or didn't know.The CD of test questions was especially problematic. It did not work originally, and you have to go online to download a fix which will provide links so that diagrams referenced in the question can actually appear. But get this - even then, the WRONG diagram would appear. Nice! Real Nice.I then purchased an EXAM CRAM 2 book which was a good choice. I can't say if it's the best choice or not, but it did the job for me as I did pass the ceritification exam.I'm not happy about giving a bad review. However, I hope to prevent someone else from experiencing the problems I faced."
4,Great desserts!,"The thing that makes this book worth having is the dessert section. I haven't made many of the savory recipies as I can manage without a recipie book for those, the thing I think every vegan needs help on is puddings and sweet things. As a vegan I really miss things like 'steamed suryp pudding' and 'chocolate cheese cake' and 'rum truffles' - untill now. This book is great because it doesn't assume that because you're vegan you only want to eat low fat carob things, it gives great recipies using proper chocolate, vegan buiscits and vegan cream. This is heaven for those of you who really miss dairy desserts - you need never go without treats again!!"
2,boring,"i lost interest almost immediately. i should have read the description better because i was under the impression it would be more of a instructional video for beginners where you have more to look at besides the teacher the whole time. would have preferred some written music showing up now and then or for him to raise and lower his voice. some reviewers say it's good for beginners but i disagree. i can read music and prefer to stick with that, not make up my own songs using chords."
5,"When the market moves, Will You be Ready?",The book is very instructive and very useful for novice as well as experienced investors. I recommend it very highly.
3,Not what I was looking for.,"I guess I didn't understand the previews of this book. It's all about LSD used in a controlled setting. I don't look to drugs for my enlightenment, so this book was not for me. I read about 25% of it, and then tossed it out. It's very well written, by a man who knows his subject, and I certainly don't mean to say it's not a good book. If you're looking for a book about the affects of LSD on the brain, it's for you."
5,Out jackie Collins - This book is a page turner.,"An extremley superior Mills and BOOM! All the necessary ingredients for kicking off your shoes on a wet Sunday afternoon. Love, reglion, a medic and a woman mad for it. The climax of the book is when our herione gets scarlet fever, but Dr. Shannon (probably with bronzed torso toboot!) saves the girl, saves the book, saves you finishing the entire bag of wine gums and any other excuse you need to waste your life.Read it. Live it. SORT IT!"
4,"billy idol really is a ""hits"" artist anyways","but a very good artist at these ""hits."" rebel yell, white wedding, and dancing with myself are defiantely great songs that may persuade a casual listener to go ahead and purchase his other albums. i really suggest that you just stick with this because i really found myself quite bored with his actual albums."
3,Don't trade your 'Vital Idol ' for this one.,"More is not always better as this album proves. It's very nicely remastered but some of the takes are quite different than the 'Vital Idol' album, notably 'Flesh For Fantasy' and 'To Be Your Lover', which lose a lot of it's impact in the shorter versions. There are some gems here however, 'Sweet Sixteen' being quite a surprise. There are two takes of 'Rebel Yell', studio and live version. A good companion to 'Vital Idol', so stick them both in your CD carosoul."
5,It's a nice day to start again...with Billy idol.,"Billy Idol was one of those rockers I always admired, but never got around to buying his albums. Then one day, it hit me that I should run and get this CD. It rocks! All the hits are here, and, even better, we get the album versions of these songs and not the edited single versions. Even a track from the misunderstood ""Cyberpunk"" release surfaces here. Pop music has really been suffering a slow death in the last 10 years, but if you want to check out a compilation by one of the most vivid rockers of the 1980's, then you can't go wrong with this excellent release. It'll only make you long for Idol's return with a new studio album."
4,Hot in the CITY!!!!!,"I've read everyone of the reviews listed here and was shocked to see no one mention one of my favorite singles and songs from the 80s ""Hot in the City"". I think I first heard the song in the movie ""Big"" and the scene where Tom Hanks sticks his head out of the sunroof of the Limo. Such a piledriving chorus and infectious arrangment. I love this song. It's the type of song I can see Bruce Springsteen bring the house down at one of his concerts."
5,Billy Idol rocks!,"If you loved 80's music then you have to had listened to Billy Idol at some point in time. This is a great cd, and has all of his #1 hits!"
4,Classic rock at its best,Love remembering where I was when I'd have the windows down cruising down the road with the Idol cranking. Still doing the same thing today
1,SO incredibly outdated!!!!,"I am glad that I didn't purchase this DVD. It was the only childbirth DVD available in my local library and I thought that since the publication date was listed as 1993 that it couldn't be that bad. But when I started seeing hairstyles from the 1970's, I knew that I'd been misled.Please DO NOT WASTE A DIME on this DVD! Honestly, this DVD should either be updated or just completely pulled from the shelves. Many of the practices shown here are totally outdated from delivery in an operating room (like seriously, do hospitals still do that?) to VBAC births. And if you're interested in natural childbirth, you'll get a kick out of what the good Dr. Tyson had to say. (Honestly, I wonder if the guy is even still delivering babies!)DO NOT GET THIS TRASH!!!!"
5,I Love These,"Not only are these great for dj'ing, they are confortable and heavy duty for everyday use. They are durable, and affordable, and has excelent bass response. I highly reccomend these headphones for anyone looking for quality durable confortable dj phones!"
5,Great headphones,The sound is awesome. Isolation is great. Quite comfortable fit. The detachable chord is a plus. Highly recommend to any DJ.
2,Joints & Headbands Break!,"I've owned two pairs of these. I agree with the other reviewer that they sound the best out of any DJ headphone that I've owned, but they are not durable. The headband and joints broke with both pairs within 6-8 months. I thought that I may have been hard on the first pair while using professionally, but the second failed after a few months of deliciate use. Dissapointing, especially at this price point."
5,Ngugi,It is indeed depressing that these series of short stories are out of print. Is there a way to get them back into print?
3,Music of all kinds,"This is the first solo album of Arnaldo after he leaves the band he have been with for more than 10 years, the ""Tits"", and is a very experimental and imaginative album. Great poetry (he also writes good books) and a music that shows a brazilian music not limited to african or latino influences, a music that is of all styles but yet a new style that we could call just ""the brasilian style""."
4,Good Fan,"Good fan. Effectively moves the air quite well. Only downsides are that its a little loud, even emitting turbine noise at low speeds and...its made in China. Shame on Patton...they used to make fans in America..."
4,Another fine novel of the old west,"Many of Louis L'Amour's heroes are loners who are riding away from trouble but take the time to detour and assist folks who find themselves in harm's way. That is the basic plot of this interesting story in Arizona of a rancher on the run who helps a man and two women protect their cache of gold in the heart of Apache country. A ruthless bounty hunter also complicates matters by laying claim to the gold strike as Indians search the canyons and mountaintops for the small party of whites. L'Amour had a gift for weaving philosophy, logic and romance into his plots and the elements all work well here. The story is a quick read but captures the flavor of the deserts and mountains of the arid, dry southwest."
4,"Good toy, but frustrating","I really liked this toy... when I got it to work. It took an hour or so to get it spinning for a couple minutes and hovering in the air. I haven't gotten it to do that again since that first time. It is incredibly difficult to get all the settings perfect, between the weight of the top and the leveling of the base. I would not recommend this for children or impatient adults. I consider myself a patient and persistent person, but even I eventually got frustrated with it and gave up on it."
3,A great idea - but maybe rough on the setup?,"I actually don't own this but sent it via Amazon.com to a friend for a holiday gift. He thinks it looks really cool and loves the idea - but still hasn't had any success in the setup. And this is a med student/ Navy nuclear submarine specialist! I have encouraged him to keep trying, but he's a little worried that his 1 1/2 year old son will have to set it up for him.I'm a little disappointed that this gift I have sent hasn't been fully appreciated yet."
3,An ok entertainer,"I bought this activity center for my son at four months old and he is of average height yet his feet do not touch the ground even though it says for four months and up,he also can't reach some of the toys which gets him extremely frustrated. I am sure he will enjoy it more in a couple of months but they should up the age or do something about adjusting the height."
5,Echo echo echo,"I must echo the positive comments of others who point out Bickersteth's solid treatment of Scripture, his clarity of wonderful truths expressed to Christ's sheep, and the book's usefulness in combatting the wide range of attacks against such a precious doctrine. The primary focus on Scripture is key. Bickersteth shows that the Trinity isn't based on Catholic dictionary definitions, pagan concepts of God, physical analogies in nature such as water, arbitrary numerics, or even in the Church's creeds that faithfully represent Scripture's teaching, but in God's inspired revelation of Himself to His people. If you embrace the ideas of this book, you will have a much greater appreciation for the Triune God Who expresses perfect Love within Himself (1 John 4:8) eternally first, and then reaches to share that love with His people (1 John 1:1-7). Then you can appreciate the God to Whom Christ submitted and prayed in His human nature, and called His Father, being 'like us' as our example."
5,WHAT AN ANGEL!!!!,"JUST PURE FAMILY ENJOYMENT. GREAT MUSIC, GREAT SCENERY, GREAT PERFORMANCE BY DOLLY ALL WRAPPED UP INTO 1. THERES A SEEN WHERE DOLLY IS LAYING DOWN AND IS MISTAKEN FOR AN ANGEL WHERE SHE REALLY LOOKS LIKE AN ANGEL. BUY IT FOR SHEER FUN!!!"
1,Purchase not rec'd,"I order a video on October 18,2002 and have yet to receive it. I contacted the seller after 3 weeks and again at 5 weeks. The reply was ""it's in the mail"". At this point I believe I've lost out totally."
2,Disappointing,I was expecting a very authoritative volume. This collection of information just skims the surface - no new knowledge or techniques were expressed.
5,The Healing Crisis,Excellent book! Everyone who wants to achieve a good health should read it. The lack of this knowledge would be a roadblock to health. I personally experienced several healing crises. If I couldn't recognize them for what they were I would have not been able to achieve better health--I would have been dead by now.
5,Recommended after 2 years of use,"I've had this lamp for just about 2 years now and it was a good purchase. No problems whatsoever, dependable, the light tone is nice, aestheticly pleasing, high quality."
4,Verilux Heritage Desk Lamp,"I intended this for use as a reading lamp on a small chairside table. It works very well for that purpose. It is sturdy, can be easily positioned, and provides excellent light for reading and writing. The rotating head allows one to turn the light away from the eyes while still lighting reading material. It would have been nice to know ahead of time the exact dimensions and travel of the adjustable arm, but it turned out to fit in my space anyway."
3,"Hitler, Stalin, and the German invasion.","As one of the previous reviewers have already stated, this book promises more than it delivers. However, it does cover in detail what happened in June, 1941. Stalin was deceived by Hitler and the Germans even though it was well known that those 185 divisions sitting on the Russian border were not there for the climate. The information was so well known that at least a dozen sources issued the alarm before the invasion actually occurred. The author does a good job detailing the state of Stalin's mind and why he was deceived. Both Stalin and Hitler had a healthy respect for each other.This is an OK read about a fascinating event. The German invasion could have turned the pages of history, but other events (Japanese actions) actually sealed Hitler's fate. The author is a respected historian and offers some new insight on some minor details."
4,Death Dance of Monsters,"I found this short book enlightening and a fascinating glimpse into the minds and characters of two of histories greatest villains, responsible for the deaths of tens of millions. Their interactions, and distrust of one another, led to the German invasion of the Soviet Union which surprised no world leader, except Stalin, who had been completely duped and made to look like a fool by Hitler. Fascinating read."
2,they're not punk enough,sorry i used to love blink 182 but then i got into THE MISFITS and DANZIG and to put it into short terms they're not punk enough for they are to much like pop groups
2,Disapointing,"I love blink. I have their 4 most recent cd's so i decided to check out the old stuff. The vocals are terrible if you are familiar with the new blink. If you want to listen to blink buy enema of the state , the new cd, or my favorite take off your pants and jacket"
3,"Certainly not Blink's greatest feat, but a good CD","Although this is not a fantastic CD, it is rather enjoyable. Most of the tracks are funny, as Blink 182 songs often are, but, unlike some of Blink's more recent albums, they sometimes sound monotonous -- they are all essentially the same. If you are a Blink fanatic, this would be a good CD for you to add to your collection, but if you have just discovered their music, I recommend one of their more recent albums instead."
5,The best Blink-182 album ever!,"The music in this cd is a lot different than say ""Take Off Your Pants and Jacket"" Instead of the pop lyrics with no punk beats, Cheshire Cat has pop lyrics with punk beats!I still enjoy listening to this cd, and learned to play all the songs (I'm a bassist) In my opinion, this cd as well as the first three are the best. Five stars without a doubt."
5,A Great Debut,"I've been a fan for a while now, and only recently have I checked into some of Blink's older stuff. I wasn't disappointed. The lyrics are simpler and funny, and it's just interesting to hear what they sounded like before all the fame and popularity.My favorites are Carousel (I LOVE this song), M+M's, and Wasting Time. Cacophony shows off the band's talent very well, too. Heck, they're all great songs. The only thing that keeps some people from buying this, I think, is the poor sound producing, but once you learn to ignore that, it's the best. Buy it."
4,Good cd,this is a good punk cd. its funny how unpolished and new blink was. there 2nd best cd only a couple songs kinda blow
1,blink-182's worst cd,Cheshire Cat sucks bad. It is so not worth the money. It should cost three pennys its so bad . Don't even think about buying it.
4,...,"Cheshire cat is good, no doubt but if you say take off your pants and jacket is trash then your messed up. They have travis, enough said. Tom and mark are both much better and they write much better songs. ... take off your pants is prob their best cd yet. They write more illicite songs and better riffs and better just to listen to. ..."
4,Not bad for made in China,"Just right for a pleasant game of chess on the porch. The pieces are a traditional design and do not feel too light or plasticy. The magnetic catch holds things closed well. The printed instructions are in very small type, poorly translated from chinese, and completely worthless. If you need instruction help with these basic games, turn to the internet."
2,Disapointing Sleeper,"I read ""The Big Sleep"" expecting a detective novel which would keep me up at night turning the pages, finishing it in one or two sittings. It lasted a month. The plot isn't all that exciting, and frankly hard to follow. There is little to no character development. I certainly felt the cigarette filled rooms smelling of booze and rumpled detectives, but the storyline was uneventful. I will rent the DVD to see what Hollywood made of the book. Certainly, there must be other intriguing works of detective fiction, perhaps even by Chandler, that would be better than ""The Big Sleep."""
4,Hardboiled,"A very good detective novel that whisks you away to the gritty underbelly and ornate mansions of 1930's Los Angeles. Beautifully written with razor sharp dialogue, a strong central character (Philip Marlowe, Private Investigator) and atmospheric description. The story's infamously labyrinthine plot with it's twists and turns is challenging but doesn't come close to being impenetrable. My only real complaint is that the book to me seems more like an exercise in style and there really isn't too much substance. All in all, an excellent read if you're looking for something well written but light. Recommended."
5,a fun resource,"My *only* gripe is that it doesn't cover all 10 seasons, but it was complete at the time of publishing. A new edition is definitely needed. It's a fun reference."
2,Key Disappointments,"It's so difficult to find a dual analog and digital watch, especially at this price. I ordered this watch from another vendor and was very disappointed to find that the digital display is BARELY visible. I called Bulova and was told by their engineering department that the photo of this watch (as are many watches) is significantly enhanced. I was further told that Bulova has received complaints about their analog/digital models (although I haven't see any others from Bulova). Bottom line is this is a great looking watch (rubber strap extremely cool) but has an unforgivable flaw, you can read it! Do not buy this watch based on the stock photo. You will be disappointed with the digital display. One other thing, if you do buy this watch and are reading the instructions, please note that to my knowledge, it does NOT have an alarm check (as the instructions indicate) nor do you press the B + C buttons to enable/disable the hourly chime. It's the A+B buttons."
1,Only if you want to look bad..,"What a badly designed jacket. I was given one as part of a management gift at work and I was shocked. The jacket is all outof proportion, with the arms being extremely large and puffy. also it seems the arms are way to long in comparison to the body of the jacket. The tapered back of the jacket (there are 2 pleats) gives the wearer the appearance of a hunch back as well as giving the wearer shoulders that are wider than the rest of the body. The only good thing about this jacket is that your dog would love it as a bed since it is overly bulky. Mind you the jacket is stiffer than Andie MacDowells acting... Not a good choice of jackets..."
1,the content is totally unrelated to the PRAXIS exam,"I do not recommend this book as a study guide, as the content is totally unrelated to the PRAXIS exam"
2,"Good quality, but not attractive in my opinion.","If you like this design, then go for it, because Peora has good quality pieces. However, after seeing this in person, I can tell you that the setting is too big and overpowering for the size of this gemstone, so it ends up looking a little weird. It might look better with a stone that has more brilliance than citrine (perhaps blue topaz?), but either way I'd look for a different setting."
2,Some random information for your convenience.,"This CD is a live recording of Jane's Addictions first show. The sound quality is just dreadful and makes the disc practically unbearable to listen to. It is an interesting peek into the bands infancy, but this is not a CD you will play frequently.When this disc came out, many thought it was a bootleg because it was a live recording not put out by either Warner Brothers or Triple-X records. However, this is a legitimate release by Eye Scream records. This was apparently released with the blessing of Perry Farrell himself. I am assuming it was either recorded too early for Warner Brothers to have the right to it, or the quality was so low that Warner Brothers didn't have any interest in it.Unfortunately, the disc just doesn't live up to the price it is commonly sold for. The sound for Had A Dad cuts out in a number of places and is spread across several tracks; it is really hard to tell if it is coming or going."
4,Weird cool,"I have the second generation model of this, the Aduki Ni, which I recommend over this model because the Aduki Ni also looks a metal sculpture when turned off. Anyway, this is a nifty decorative item that people are certain to ask about. It can be used inside or out, and includes a strap to hang it from a tree or whatever. The light generated by this isn't sufficient to use as illumination, but it definitely adds color to a scene and looks pretty bright in a darkened environment. The effect can also be seen with indoor lighting, in which case it looks like it's just changing color like a chameleon.On the downside, it must be kept charged. Not only does it take several hours to charge (18 hours out of the box) but there are strong warnings against letting it run down to zero. I don't know what happens in that case, but apparently it's not something you can just leave on and forget about. I have had mine on for a little over three hours continuously though without it running down."
5,fast moving,"This book moves fast and is never dull. It is not a Christian book, but is written by someone with a Christian world view. This means it is probably more Christian than so called Christian fiction is today. I loved it!"
3,drawing techniques,The book have techniques that I already knew but can be helpful if you are trying to learn
4,Feed - Alex O'Loughlin,"The best thing about this movie is Alex O'Loughlin. Not only is he fun to look at but this man can act. It is so apparent in this film.I would have never considered seeing this film if it had not been for him. The producer was smart enough to see that he had a goldmine in this young and ambitious actor. I am sure he is kissing Alex's feet right now. He is breathtaking to look at, even with his bleached blonde hair.Alex is going to be one of the finest actors of our times and this movie is a good example as to why. He takes a rather disjointed story and turns it into something to pay attention to. I simply fast forward past the other scenes that do not include him and watch him do his magic.Alex fans, watch the interviews and extras first before you actually watch the movie. It makes the whole thing easier to watch. Alex makes Michael Carter a memorable, hypnotic character and the reason to have this film in your library."
1,Unique idea for a horror film isn't enough to keep it from being AWFUL,"This has more of a porn feel to it than a horror movie feel. It could have been a neat thriller/horror based on a sick sexual fetish, but it was just so poorly done that it fails. The one standout in this otherwise sloppy mess, is the performance by Alex O'Loughlin. He was pretty awesome. Other wise feel free to avoid. The ""shocks"" are really yawn inducing."
3,Different,"It was... different. Feed is a good name for the movie, in the beginning and the end. I guess something like this could happen, but I'd rather not think about it. This was a very different role for Alex."
4,I'LL HAVE 10 PIZZAS WITH EVERYTHING!,"Good Lord! This has to be the sickest film I've ever seen. It even beats the infamous ""SALO"" (in some ways). It is also very well made in all respects, and a must-see for fans of Mondo movies and the like. Tense, brutally graphic, and way over the top nauseating. I liked it! I hope this fetish does not really exist. Now when is a good vomit fetish flick coming out? After I saw this flick, I had two cheeseburgers."
2,Bigger Isn't Always Better,"Feed's got a very interesting concept, and unfortunately that's all it has. Basically this film is just another one of those serial killer flicks in the vein of Kiss The Girls/Taking Lives//Bone Collector, take your pick. Maybe with a dash of Saw as well. That's why the movie's so....blah. Outside of a killer with a unique modus operandi, this is pretty by the numbers, and not all that well done I might add. Tortured detective with baggage of his own? Check. Sly, intelligent, philosophical and charming killer? Check. Tons of herky-jerky, speed up/slow down MTV style editing that's looked lame since Natural Born Killers? Got that too. I do have to give this movie something for managing a feel of ickiness without using much gore. This movie isn't as gruesome as people say, but it manages some yuckiness by using gluttony for it's ""eeeewww"" factor. Watch if you're curious, but you've seen this before."
3,been using it for over a year now,"really happy with cover, though i wish it was a hair longer. i really like the piping , ads a bit more quality to the product. would buy anothther one again if needed."
1,MIxer cover-does not fit,"I bought this for my new kitchenaid mixer. It came from a company in Florida. I tried to put it on my mixer and it did not even come close to fitting. It said it fits all kitchen aid mixers. NOT TRUE. I called the company and they said they would send me a postage sticker to send it back. They did, but the post office would not take it, as it was dated for the week before, even though I tried to return ASAP. So I Paid to ship it back. I called the company again. They said they would credit account and refund my postage. Well, it ended up It cost me to ship it back as they did not refund that amount. Not happy with this company and Amazon. I tried to complain to Amazon, but got no where with that. The add is false advertising, as it does not fit. It was at least 3+ inches too short and the top barely fit, and since it was material, when washed it would never work. Amazon, take this off your site!!! Goodman's was the name of the company. FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!"
5,Wonderful!!,"This item keeps the dirt and dust out of my wonderful KitchenAid stand mixer, and it was extremely reasonably priced and a very fast shipment!! Thanks!"
4,Not my kid's kindergarten,"I think this book is charming, and my younger child loves the animal illustrations. But my kindergartener isn't interested in it, and now that he has actually started kindergarten, I can guess one possible reason why: the classroom shown in the book bears ZERO resemblance to his kindergarten room. Where we live, kindergarten in the public schools isn't about toys and art and dramatic play. It's about desks and workbooks. So the classroom in the book shows my son everything he misses from pre-K. In his shoes, I think I would hate this book for that reason. And as a parent, this book makes me all the more unhappy about his real kindergarten. This is not the book's fault, of course, but it's a small lesson in unintended consequences for me as a parent."
3,A solid entry in the Spenser canon.,"This is not a spectacular book but a solid one. It took me over 2 decades(!!) to acquire a taste for Spenser but am now caught. Drug trafficking is almost a McGuffin in this book about drugs but also about dedication, honorability, pursuit of truth, corruption, and painful tragedy. Parker does not write easy books, but, as far as I have read him, does not write bad books, either. Solid and entertaining."
5,A classic,"This is a great book on several different levels. As a guide to drawing the human figure, it is unsurpassed and contains formulas, tricks and theories that would help anyone who wants to learn how to draw people. As a piece of nostalgia, the text is interesting because this book was written in the 1940s for commercial artists. In particular, the ""ad layout man"" who had to know how to draw people for comp work.As for myself, I bought the book to help in the life drawing class I'm taking. If you're involved in figure drawing, this book is a must have."
5,Terrific Find,"I just received this book today and I am really happy with my purchase. There is an abundance of helpful information that I wish I had in one reference of this quality a while ago. Loomis includes quite a bit of text as well as many example illustrations covering issues which commonly trip up the novice (yep, that's me) such as realtive proporation, changing perspecitve, foreshortening etc.; it's a substantial volume and seems pretty complete in its treatment of the subject matter. Are there a bunch of statuesque, 50's- era ladies in nothing but high heels, as some reviewers have lamented? ... Why yes, but the techniques are valid regardless of the subject matter. The principles are not outdated. (Does anyone else think we need to cut back on the fast food after reading this book?) Final analysis - This is a great book for anyone wanting to improve their figure drawing skills. I now have Loomis's companion book on drawing the head and hands on its way."
5,"If you're just starting out, better than a dictionary","I took this to an immersion camp having had absolutely no Japanese before arrival, and found it more useful than my dictionary. As Japanese sentence structure is not so intuitive (to native English-speakers), the included phrases are a must to understand how words and particles fit into sentences. I also prefer it over other phrasebooks as it is arranged alphabetically, not thematically, in the English to Japanese section, which is the majority of the book. The grammar section and culture notes are also helpful. I absolutely recommend this to anyone who has never studied Japanese before, and needs a dictionary that will help you make sentences."
2,Boring and uninspiring,"As a fan of the Seasons...my Dad drove me all over to see them play in concert, this is probably one of the weakest recordings ever done by the band. Frankie's voice is gone, clearly augmented by the back up group known as the ""Seasons"". The mixing clearly lowers Frankie's microphone so as not to make his voice the main voice.That it is only 76 minutes in length is a bigger dissapointment. How can 30 years (At the time) of material be whittled down to only 76 minutes. Too many great songs left off the set, which could have been added had they dropped the lame 50's doo-wop stuff.I'd rather see a documentary on the history of the group, including t.v. performances and other concert film from their prime. The Seasons have gone through more line-up changes than Yes. If they really want to do a reunion, cure Gaudio's stagefright, make amends with Joe Long and dust off Tommy DeVitto's guitar.On the plus side, I think Larry Lingle won Mullet of the Year Award for that hair style!"
3,"Not Good, Not Bad","Being a Eddie Van Halen fan is the reason I purchased this CD.Unfortunately, Eddie only plays on 3 tracks. Those are truly the only inspired songs on the disc. If you MUST have this CD because you're a Eddie freak I'd say go for it, if not listen to Fair Warning instead."
3,Solid 3 star movie with 5 star elements,"Fun action movie with a good story. Some of the acting & dialog is a little awkward, and some scenes seemed rushed, but overall it was a good adventure. The CG is great; I'm pretty impressed with the way the actors and eyeborgs interacted. I'm looking forward to Eyeborgs II."
2,Good cgi. If you like B SiFi movie's go for it.,Poor production quality and directing. Not much to the storey either. Toward the end of the movie a woman cop gets killed during a shootout with the robots and a few scenes later the same scene is used again. If you like the movies that the SiFi channel makes you will probably like this one. I had to fast forward through all the time wasting arguing scenes (a favorite way to fill time when there's an idea for a movie but no storey). I would say it could have been cut down to 30 minutes with the material they had to work with.
2,my eyes hurt,"Eyeborg: An eyeborg or eye-borg is a cybernetic body apparatus which typically fits on the wearer's head, and is designed to allow people to perceive color through sound waves. It is mostly used by blind people or by people with visual impairments such as color blindness or achromatopsia.Not this movie."
5,Porter Cable 4216 Super Jig - Dovetail jig (4215 With Mini Template Kit),Very good product.I made all new dovetail drawers for my kitchen. I watched a lot of videos before I started and made twenty one drawers.Once you have it set up you just keep on making them. Great product!Would recommend this product!!Thanks Danny
2,Not enough Science,"The polyanish attitude of Zubrin to dismissing real hurdles to a Mars mission makes this book more of a cheerleading manual than a science treatise. It's a good read if one leaves science at the door and flips the pages for an adventure story. He creates a cult following of those who enjoy Star Trek, Star Wars, etc. and don't have the ability to distinguish science and science fiction.The book deserves one star for Science but I'll add another star for enthusiasm. 'The Chariots of the Gods' reader will enjoy the book."
5,Excellent,"This is a very logical, clear, good argument of a decline in American culture and how that decline is reflected in the acceptance of Bill Clinton's behavior by many Americans. Those who support Clinton should really give this book a chance. Bennett makes some very thought-provoking statements about the U.S. Constitution which are worth the price of the book."
1,Buy it used for $0.01? It is a waste of your money.,"In this era of narrowmindedness and conservative and reactionary clap-trap, this serves as a sterling example that if you fill a book with enough vitriol, someone will buy it. I long for a day when the two nations of the United States (The ""right"" wing and everybody else) will be healed. Perhaps this is just a resurfacing of an even older wound, namely the Civil War. The Republicans of the South (and elsewhere) continually defending the Confederate battle flag (note: it was only a battle flag, not the CSA national flag) and by proxy segregation and slavery. It is with bitter irony that a Republican freed the slaves, since now they are the party of the elite.This book is like all the other Clinton bashing books, high on venom, low on truth. If you like that kind of book...well you can buy one for a penny used. For everyone else, save your penny; God knows you will have to save more than that to survive this Bush economy!"
1,Simple minds are easily bemused.,"Methinks the self-proclaimed pillar of virtue named Bennett doth protest too much. He does casuistic cartwheels and Puritan pirouettes in order to project continuing Republican shame over Watergate onto the Clintons: a stomped-to-death tactic that does not, has not, and shall not yield another bitter grape, let alone the wine of salvation. Bennett's collage of Utopian morality, tired, glittering denials of human nature, and one self-replicating argumentum ad hominem after another speaks volumes about the hypocrisy, cynicism, and self-serving affronts to critical reason that will come to be seen as the true Reagan legacy. But why expect more of a failed ""Drug Czar"", who never quite succeeded in recovering from his addiction to tobacco? That anyone could take Bennett's death-knell of statesmanship and partisan harmony seriously suggests that outrage indeed is dead: The title says it all, if not quite as its author intended."
4,Bill Bennett says what the cable pundits ignore.,"I'm not a religious person so I had reservations about buying a Bill Bennett book. However after reading it I'm already ordering some of his other titles. Mr. Bennett uses the media's own quotes and headlines to explain exactly what the Clinton scandals have done to our society. Bible thumping is not included (okay but very very limited) which pleased me. My only complaint is that the book was written in the early summer of '98. If Mr. Bennett would have waited a few more months it would be interesting to note any changes. Even though it is well worth the read, for Democrats and Republicans alike."
5,Bennett explains why America not following Lewinsky affair,"In Death of Outrage, moral leader and Larry King guest Bill Bennett presents a brilliant analysis of the corrupt and depraved Clinton administration and scolds the American public for largely ignoring all of the wrongdoing in the White House. Bennett accurately describes the media's strange lack of coverage of the entire affair, as well as the American public's lack of interest or knowledge that the Lewinsky affair had even taken place. Hence his ingenious title, ""Death of Outrage"". Bravo, Mr. Bennett. You are a man of impeccable morality and intelligence and decency and god bless you."
4,"A clear, step-by-step discussion of what's at stake","The good news is that books aren't dead. They are a key forum in today's on-the-edge public debate. This book by William Bennett examines the case against the President and what's really at stake in his troubled presidency.The bad news is that books like this get slammed by partisans who, as partisans do (or rather do not do) listen. Read this. It's good, well reasoned and lays it all out. It's also mercifully short, only 154 pages of good, clear writing. Good writing is really the product of clear thinking. This book qualifies. Whether you are for or against the President, read the arguments and what they really mean. We need to get beyond ""spin"" and use our minds. This will help."
1,Totally irrational and abusive,Mr. Bennett is so abusive and irrational that it would amaze most people that this book could find a publisher. This book belongs in the trash can.
5,Good reference for the newbie.,Mr. Duane has done a good job discussing different pool tables and their care. This is not a price guide but it will help you determine what a pool table is worth to you. It will help you determine whether that table on craigslist is a steal or a ripoff or whether it is even worth paying someone to move it. I recently acquired a vintage table at an estate auction and according to the book I feel like overall I didn't do too bad. The only problem was that the book arrived after the auction. If I had the book I probably would have bid slightly differently. I recommend it to anyone who is serious about acquiring a new or used pool table.
3,good album,I'm glad i picked up this album. Its probably the best of Ali AKbar Khans playingThis is probably recorded in the mid 60s when he was at his prime.
4,Cassidy finds soulmate in Brown for superb treatment of some,"The Other Side is a duet studio with Eva and Chuck Brown. I have never heard of Chuck Brown either but he fits her like a glove. His vocals and piano playing remind me of Charles Brown at his more soulful. Like Blues Alley, this is a cover CD. Eva and Chuck sing some great songs from blues to jazz with a standard thrown in for good cause. Some of the songs feature horns, however it is the stripped down ballads that are the standouts. ""You Don't Know Me"", ""Fever"", and Ray Charles"" ""Drown in My Own Tears"" are great. However, the price of admission is Eva's rendition of Dan Penn's ""Dark End of the Street"". This CD has a more blues feel than Blues Alley, probably due to the song selection and the addition of Chuck Brown. However, it is just as wonderful."
4,Pleasant Surprise,"I did not know of Eva Cassidy. I heard ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" on the radio on some obscure station and loved it so much I wrote down the artist's name and immediately ordered the CD when I got home. I can't get enough of this rendition of the classic song. But, I did not expect the jazz/rhythm & blues tone of the rest of the songs on the CD. Great listening!"
3,A Clockwork Orange meets Desperate Housewives,"I have been a fan of Kim Bassinger for many years, I think that on top of her obvious good looks, she has a pretty good sense of comic timing and has on occasion showed some wonderful skills as a dramatic actress as well. I really quite liked her recent suspense filmCellular (New Line Platinum Series)so I was excited to see this DVD of a film I hadn't before heard of.But here's the deal... While Bassinger is pretty good in this film, the script is just not. The language is atrocious, and the story line is just silly. And if you can't just get into the spirit of ""Kill `em All !"" with all the bad guys, then you will probably be heavily dissatisfied with this movie. However, the very end is a bit of a surprise and it made up for some of the other parts for me.But maybe that's just me.2 & *"
2,Kim is really slumming this time - in this grizzly horror flick,"I missed this film in the theaters, though I big Kim Basinger fan. (Ah LA Confidential!). Now I know why.Here name on the package is almost as big as the title.I think I expected ""suspense"" not ""horror"" and it's quite a violent film. I certainly spent no time with the Director's commentary. (That would not convince me to like this film any better.) BTW, check out the ""rave"" quotes on the package. Folks like LA Weekly and NY Observer, not exactly the NY Times.I sure hope Basinger goes back to making quality dramas.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic"""
5,While She Was Out,I purchased this for my wife for Xmas and she hasn't viewed it yet but I know she will love it because it was in our Cart.
3,Easy watching,"Kim Basinger is the redeeming feature in this plot-lite crazed killer gang piece. The plot is remarkably predictable, except perhaps the ending, and the bad guys not especially scary or unusual. However Basinger is credible as an unhappy affluent suburbia disappointed wife, and the scenes at the upscale mall at Christmas time effectively conveyed her feelings of alienation and near despair."
3,"Good acting, but not much of a storyline","Kim Basinger played the down-trodden housewife and victim well. I thought Haas also did a fairly good job of playing the villain. The plot is a simple one and early on, one keeps hoping there is something more. However, it held my interest due to the good acting by Basinger. The ending was abrubt and unexpected, and as a whole, I did enjoy the movie. The blue-ray quality was pretty good, but don't expect any special features, as there aren't any."
4,Format is fine on a Kindle 3,"Contrary to statements by other reviewers, I can report that this text is properly formatted, at least on a Kindle 3. The lines are occasionally short, but only because the following word is long, and Kindle can not break and hyphenate words. That said, I find it very legible.A serious student will be disappointed by the absence of book and section numbers, the standard way of making reference to passages in this classic text."
1,"Terrible! Not what is pictured not even round,",This is not worth it! The globe wasn't even round as my husband put it it was more like a smushed apple. In the picture and description it says blue waters ours came clear! Terrible terrible
2,Not at all as pictured!,"Is an inexpensive item so I did not expect it to be super ""high quality"" or anything, but it does not look AT ALL like pictured. It is clear with no blue whatsoever, and the continent colors look a lot different than in the picture. Definitely not smooth & perfectly rounded like in the picture (lopsided with flat area on the bottom), but I kind of expected that to an extent. I used these as a decoration for a ""Holidays Around the World"" show at an elementary school, so didn't need perfection, but being totally the wrong color & not matching the other decorations was a real bummer :("
3,Ok tub mat,Works great for a small child. Once they learn to pull the edges up it is time to find a different product. Also needed to scrub between the suction cups frequently to remove build up from the water that had trouble draining from underneath the mat.
5,Favorite Fragrance,"I love this fragrance. It's strong, but sweet...It's a powerful smell, but not overbearing. My wife and I stumbled upon this parfum years ago in a fragrance store and it was my favorite out of probably 30 choices that we tried that day. Since then, it has continued to be the #1 perfume for me that my wife wears. I don't know how to describe it very well, but it's not flowery or powdery. To me, it is maybe a little musty, but when I smell it, I am passionate for her. It is rich, full and dreamy!"
2,Magical?,"Senna tea is truly magical in the way it temporarily replaces your internal organs with bees.I guess I must not be worthy enough in the constipation department to truly reap the benefits of Senna, and so the gods of this truly magical herb treated me instead to merciless abdominal pain and rear-ended agony.Does it make you poop? Yes, you will poop everything that is inside you, including your innards."
2,I dont like the price not the product,Why Senna tea has become so expensive!I been ordering Senna tea for years.Price used to be 2.50 a box. Now its 7.50!
5,redeeming value?,"In response to Shawn Sutherland's ponderance as to whether one might find redeeming value to reading about such a fellow as Carl Panzram, perhaps one might question what created such a man? And by discovering this one might prevent another such creature. Of course I'm presupposing that you find Mr. Panzram's actions to be something that this world couldn't use. I find myself admiring Mr. Panzram and striving to be more like him. Can you blame him for being disgusted with his fellow race? I find myself hating you more with each passing day. You allowed a man who has caused much more havoc and has done many more ""evil"" deeds to be elected to the office of the President of the United States. Yet you find fault with Mr. Panzram? You are a strange person.If you want to know what your society is making of men, then read about Carl Panzram. Perhaps then you will get an inkling of what you are capable. Dare you be as humane as Mr. Panzram. For is it not human nature to war on one another?"
1,Pierre Cardin Women's Diamond Collection Diamond Accented Watch,"I decided to buy this watch after I read the reviews and the overall rating.When I received the watch I was very disappointed to see that the words Pierre Cardin on the top and Diamond on the bottom were not written in straight line (as they appear in the photo, i.e., parallel to the upper and lower sides of the rectangular frame) but instead they were going upwards (kind of diagonally).The diamonds are really tiny as it was mentioned in other reviews and the watch does look substantial in terms of weight. Another drawback is its clasp. It is really very hard to open and close.However, the diagonally written ""Pierre Cardin"" and ""Diamond"" words, makes the watch not wearable since it is very visible, plus it raises questions on its authenticity."
4,nice watch,the watch was smaller than i thought but still it looks very elegant and classy for a woman. i got it on sale so i dont regret what i paid.fully recommend the watch.
3,DVD Drive too loud,"The good:- plays multiple formats (DVD+R/-R, VCDs, etc)- DV input for burning from camcorder- my old VHS tapes played very clearlyThe bad:- DVD drive was very loud when playing discs (more so than any other DVD player I've ever had). It's not extremely loud, but very irritating -- especially if you're a bit of a nit-picker like me.- no HDMI- remote worked well, but the labels on the buttons were very, very large -- great for someone who has trouble reading small writing, but it's just ugly to me.The noise on the DVD drive was annoying enough so that I didn't even get to try the recording feature of the DVD drive before returning it."
1,"Biased Hack ""Journalist""","This guy is absolutely outrageous. He seems to just write things to create controversy, thereby increasing publicity on himself. His articles are pretty much merit less given the fact that he knows the subjects/players that he writes about as well as he knows a salad. He is a shining example of the kind of shock journalism that is so prevalent today. Please do not buy this book! It is bad enough that he draws a paycheck from ESPN, The Kansas City Tribune, and his publisher; do not give him anymore unearned money."
5,A Powerful Tribute to Disciple and Guru,"Towards the end of his life Pandit Nikhil Banerjee had decided that he wished to spend the rest of his life following and learning from his beloved teacher, Ustad Ali Akbar Khan -- hailed by Yehudi Menuin as the greatest living musician on earth. Revealed by the beauty and spontenaeity of this CD's ragas -- where quite clearly Khansahib's sarode leads Banerjee's sitar without impinging on any of the student's own creative genius -- is the true depth of Banerjee's and Khansahib's spiritual and musical connection. The emotion evident in both exquisite tracks is even more poignant given Banerjee's untimely death in 1986 at the age of 55. His loss has left a void in Hindustani classical music that has yet to be filled. Khansahib, thankfully, continues to this day to create the same magic he did on that blessed day in the 1960s when this recording was made."
1,Sample before you purchase,Thin viscosity lube much like water. Dries rapidly after application. I strongly do not recommend this product. Its cost far exceeds other silicon lubes that outperform K-Y.
3,Night Crew engages only to disappoint.,"I must admit I was pleased to see another Sanford novel, even if it was not a ""Prey"" book. The book started off promisingly, but ultimately leaves one in the dust wondering what happened. The ending is far too abrupt and I had the feeling that Sanford simply ran out of gas. As usual, the nice touches abound; Anne Batory is a non-practicing pianist, Creek is a veteran and the ex-cop is a lawyer. These touches are not unlike normal L.A. life where everyone is someone else. As a pleasant evenings diversion, this book suffices, but for re-reading, far too much is telegraphed and the ending seems more like a ten car pile-up."
2,Out of control woman chases false leads to bizarre ending.,"I found Night Crew to be far below the level of all the Prey books by Sandford. What plot there was went in so many directions, I, as an accomplished reader, needed a road map. It's not very often I have to go back and re-read pages to stick with a story. Having characters with similar names: Jake, Jacob, Jason led to confusion as to whom was alive, dead, or waiting to be heard from. Speaking of characters: Please find me any person that could possibly take the physical assaults Anna received and continue on to ""solve"" this chaotic ""thriller"". Even V.I. or Kinsey would have been hardpressed to handle all this violence. Developing a more in-depth study of Anna's relationships with other characters would have helped to give better insight into Anna as a person. A film crew at night chasing news stories has a lot of potential. Kooky characters and violent events can still be used. Just keep it believable."
3,The only John Sanford novel that I have read that is not five-star.,"I have read about six of the Prey novels, two of the Kidd novels, and two of the Flowers novels, and would give 5 stars to all of them. This book is a fine beach or airplane read, but it is not in the same class as Sanford's other books."
5,This guy can write,"I'm really glad to have discovered this author. He writes so well it's scary how bad the competition look in comparison. I rushed out to find one of his ""Prey"" series and devoured it in twenty four hours."
3,"Very Nice, But...","I haven't seen the PBS show ""Take Me Home"" but I watched the new DVD last night and was disappointed by the set and the weird lighting effects. What was with all that heavy blue light and the spot sweeps of the audience? It seemed like they wanted to make it more like a rock concert; the set and lighting for the first show's DVD was superior in every way.As other reviewers have mentioned, the repetition of so much of the first show's music, fifteen out of twenty-nine numbers, seems excessive.That said, the music is beautifully done and the five men's performances as fine as the first show. It's time to give Damian McGinty some more mature material. He's a young man now. And it was nice to see George Donaldson able to cut loose on 'I'm Gonna Be"""
2,Not up to the original standards,"The original is one of my all time favorites. ""Take Me Home' is OK but the production standards are nowhere near as good. A mix of previous selections with a few new. Seems to me an attempt to capitalize on the success of the original."
2,Horrible Production,"As I've read in many reviews already, I was totally disappointed in this DVD. I have all of their other DVD's and have played them over and over. I'm not sure I'd even play this one a 2nd time. The lighting and videography stunk! The guys are terrific singers and entertainers and the look of this DVD was so awful, I could barely stand to watch it. Nothing new really except 2 songs by Damian and the band was also great, as usual. Whoever threw this one together made a lemon this time. The guys and their whole production crew (orchestra, musicians) as well as their fans deserve better! I wish I had purchased the CD this time. I think DECCA needs to make this right and do a ""make-over"" on this one. I hope they never use that set again for any of their DVD concerts....AWFUL, just AWFUL!!"
4,CT Take me Home,"Another very nice performance by the guys. Damian's new voice is so different it takes some getting used to. Video production however, is terrible. It detracts from the overall effect. Take me Home theme song is very good. Enjoyed Paul's version of You Raise Me Up."
5,Uplifting Music,"I discovered Celtic Thunder Through PBS and ordered the CD and DVDs from Amazon and the music helped me get through a difficult time with the loss of my husband of 30 yrs and the loss of my mother at Christmas. I could listen to the music and escape my saddness for a time. I enjoyed their music and watching them so much that I have ordered all their cds and DVDs from Amazon now and am going to one of their concerts in October. I am looking forward to their newest DVD ""STORM"" to be released for sale."
5,An entertaining and engaging mix of pathos and humour,"Drawing on her life experiences, which range from a poverty stricken childhood in a dysfunctional family to a mature woman who has through hard work and determination achieved a comfortable lifestyle, Billie Hughes Locke has woven a rich story that is at times heart wrenching, poignant, and endearingly funny. A compassionate and spiritual person, Billie has an amazing ability to find a positive lesson in all situations, no matter how dire. This is a lovingly constructed story that will leave a lasting memory on the reader. Having known Billie for sixteen years, I know that it is also an honest and open account of her life."
3,ONLY ONE DOLL!!!,"The doll is great, and if I saw it in a store it would get 5 stars. The reasons for the lower rating is the misleading advertising...this is not two dolls, it is one two-sided doll. Very cute, but it's a misleading ad."
3,it's OK,"It looks good, but the size is smaller than I thought. You need a small head to put it on. We tried to use it for a prank at a wedding, and had trouble finding anyone with a small enough head......but it does look goooooood"
1,This is Junk,"While Howard's ""Secrets of"" videos are probably the best DVD learning tools available today, this 2 DVD set is worthless. The video is basically chopped up pieces of lectures given at his September 2004 Poker Fantasy Camp. The limited amount of information given is marginally valuable at best. My guess is that this video was promised to the people who attended. I would suggest this video is not a great advertisement for future participation."
5,THE SD 10 excellent muti purpose /Infared Camera,Great Camera with kit lenses that far surpass Nikon Kit lenses. The Foveon censor should not be compared to standard CMOS ccd's This is a whole new way to get quality Photos. The camera shoots in raw but can also be saved using SIGMA PRO at double the file size .You would have to buy genuine fractals software to accomplish what you get out of the box.Another huge plus for me is the several hundred dollars I saved not converting my Nikon digital to a dedicated infared camera. Because with the sd10 you can easily remocve the hot mirror and take some infared shots put it back and continue with regular shots.Try this with any other camera and you will void your warranty . This can not be done with the SD9.
4,Good info,"I have enjoyed this book. Although I've been cooking for years, I learned some new tips/trick and feel it was a good purchase. I'm sure newer cooks would like it even more!!!"
3,low budget funny not bad,if your going to watch this and bitch the whole way throught your review stop no one wants to read it .it wasnt the best but it wasnt the worst Z movie i have seen . low budget not to bad watch and see
4,Text for class,"From what I learned so far from the text, it's a good historical overview for individual interested in policy. It's easy to read and understand. I am truly enjoying the book so far."
3,First Act Accordion for granddaughter,We ordered this accordion for our granddaughter for her birthday (she had requested an accordion). We ordered this First Act accordion after reading the favorable reviews. When we received the accordion there were no instructions or playbook. The description of the accordion stated that an instruction booklet would come with the product. I did email the company and they emailed me a copy of the instruction manual but it was 43 pages and I could not print that many pages. I requested that a manual be sent to me (since it should have been included in the packaging)but they informed me that they didn't have any physical copies. The accordion is as described but I would have ordered another brand that included the instruction booklet.
1,Fascinations Levitron Cherry Wood Impossible to levitate,"Not so simple to use thsi Fascinations Levitron Cherry WoodThe Quality Control seem to be a little bit absent here, the washer was missed, the overall quality is very low.The starter seem to be made for something else because the size of the cone is wrong.In fact after a lot of time and a lot of try I am not able to levitate the spinner.My experience is totally negative, before you buy a Fascinations Levitron Cherry Wood will be best to make a real personal test."
4,My 17 month old loves it,"I bought this seat for my one year old and we love it. I only gave it four stars because it was a hassle trying to find a bike that it would fit. You need about 2 inches on the frame to mount the seat and it took me a few months to find a bike it would fit. (I guess that is more of an issue with the bike than the seat really). Overall, I love the seat. My daughter points and things and says ""Weeee"" while we are riding. I can't imagine having her on the back of my bike. The instillation was very simple and the seat comes off easily if you don't need to use it. I am very pleased with this product."
5,From a tape connoisseur,I ship a lot of items and as you may know packages ago through a LOT of wear in transit. A quality tape makes all the difference. I tried a few different brands and am now sticking with this because it is the best. Very thick and uber sticky. Gets my packages to my customers in one piece.
5,Best Shipping Tape On the Market,"I have been in business for 15 years, shipping my products all over the USA. This is the best tape I have found. It has never failed to my knowledge, and the price is right. Thanks for making it available through Subscribe and Save."
1,mehh..,"This tape is thick and silent. When you use a tape dispenser it doesn't make that sound that other tapes make.The downside:- Sometimes it doesn't really stick. You really have to smooth it out for the tape to really stick.- Dispenses way too easily. Sometimes I end up over using the tape!Honestly, I'd rather have the thinner ones. Where I don't have to hassle about trying to use it!"
1,Drama Absent of Drama...,"I do my best to find admirable qualities in all films, yet 'Everyone' left me wanting those 90 minutes of my life back.The film follows five dysfunctional couples through a gay wedding. The acting is tolerable at best; the dialog painful. Perhaps my biggest disappointment of all is an utter lack of a plot. The characters are flat and unchanging. If there was any comic relief, I missed it through my cringing.To be optimistic, it could have been a decent movie... after a total rewrite of the script and recasting. But as it is, I couldn't recommend it to my worst enemy."
3,I wanted to like it...,"It's an okay movie about a gay couple on the day of the wedding / ceremony of union.Some reviewers talked about the bad acting...which didn't seem all that awful to me. My main issue is that after an hour and a half of all this drama there was no satisfying resolution to these stories. While that may be lifelike, for a movie it really sucks. I wanted to like this movie but it just wasn't to be."
3,Don't be fooled,"I rented this recently and it looked to be ""My Big Fat Gay Wedding"" as one of the characters described it. AND it was in the comedy section. This film is in no way a comedy. It may be dark but that is just the situations that present within the film. This is a film that almost defies classification. There are comedic moments, but I never laughed once. There are dramatic situations, but not enough to pull heartstrings or keep you on the edge of your seat. This is a normal slice of life character piece. And that's it. It's almost like watching the nanny-cam in your neighbor's house. Not dull but just not that interesting either."
3,""" Let Go and Let God""","Samuel L. Jackson plays a detective named Lorenzo Council. Council is instructed to vists and question a carjacking victim (Brenda, played by Julianne Moore) who is presently in the emergency room. In the course of questioning her, Lorenzo learns that Brenda's child, Cody, was in the car, ill and sleeping when the crime was committed.This begins a search for the child and a police shutdown of the Armstrong projects, to which Lorenzo is intimately connected. This is the neighborhood where Brenda works and where the carjacking occurred. The projects begin erupting with issues of race and violations of civil rights while the story of Brenda and her child slowly unravels.The ending is decent and the performances of Samuel L. Jackson and Julianne Moore are very good, although the movie is not all that captivating. I would say it's worth watching once."
4,"Interesting, well acted and intriguing",Again Julianne's acting is full of depth and in my opinion she carried off her characters complexities exceedingly well...Samuell was good throughout although I was left feeling his role was undeveloped though he was playing a cop I was left feeling at times he had more to say about his own story not negating the racial tensions created by the Police Dept clamped down on the 'Armstrong Community' with Julianne's son going missing. The lead actress who represented the missing childrens parents group was very good too (plays the lead in Nurse Jackie) and her scene played with Julianne at Freedomland was totally captivating and believable and helped us get to the gut wrenching truth behind Julianne's story and her missing son. Again the performances were great and touching. This movie is well worth it.
1,a waste of time,"This movie was confusing and pointless. The plot jumped around, involved God, and made little sense whatsoever. Watching the first half an hour made me wonder if I was watching a sequel, because I had no idea what was going in. The ending was mediocre and didn't resolve anything. The characters just took up screen time. Julianne Moore was superb in her role but her emotional outbursts, while constitute great acting, did not add anything positive to the movie. This is a movie trying desperately to relate a message on race relations and father-son relationships and who knows what else; it fails miserably in all aspects."
3,crash vs mystic river,i thought it reminded me a little bit like crash witht he races yelling at each other and mystic river when the dad was looking for girls killer now its mom looking for sons kidnapper
2,Moore HORRIBLY Miscast!!,"Julianne Moore, as the desperate mother whose car was carjacked with her son in the back seat, was totally, completely unbelievable in the role. Not a scene or inch of dialogue rang true, and her acting was incredibly sub-par and annoying to the point of ruining the movie. Jackson does his usual great work, but her performance, the unrealistic scenarios of police 'procedure,' and the choppy direction did the movie in. Pretty darn bad...."
4,The Foundling by J. R. Kinser,"This book is a ""quasi-thriller"" fictionalized accountbased on a worse case scenerio of not only the moralbut the legal implications surrounding fetal cell research.The reader is caught up in the possible dark side of themedical research field using fetal cells to achieve whatmany rationalize as ""The ends justify the means"", but legalimplications are introduced which could serve to complicatethat end. This is a must-read for those who have thought thatthe use of stem cells from aborted fetuses could offer nothingbut advantages. Even those readers with a limited medicalknowledge can readily understand the significance of themessage this book presents."
4,Good choice for expanding knowledge of ASL,"I wanted to continue teaching my (hearing) 17 month old granddaughter sign language. She knows more than 20 signs already using Baby Einstein's ""First Signs"" DVD, and ""Talking Hands"" DVD. She is now learning her colors, and names of food so this DVD of ""Favorite Things"" met my needs.The Pros:Nice mix of songs, live action, cartoon frog, and different age children signing and talking including Rachel's daughter, Leah, who is deaf. Rachel's use of color coding her fingers, and simple explanations of each sign is very helpful.Cons:While the 30 minutes run time on the DVD is perfect for showing during meal times, and snack times, I feel the cost is a little high compared to other educational DVDs. The number of signs covered on each DVD is not that many unless you include the ones used during songs etc. However, as long as my granddaughter continues to show an interest in learning sign language I will continue to purchase new DVDs."
4,Thumbs Up,"Many reviewers of the book have been to the restaurant(s) and have sampled its menus ""live"" - I have not. My comments are purely on the book. It is a very good bar-b-que book. The recipes in it are mouthwatering, and I don't mean just a few either. The ""hook"" in many of these recipes is that they utilize an all-purpose red rub recipe and/or a basic sauce recipe (the Mutha Sauce) provided in the book. I have made both recipes in order to try many of the interesting recipes. My only complaints are that the Mutha Sauce produces a very vinegary sauce and the one quarter cup of pepper sauce in it may, for some tastes, be a little over the top. If it suits your taste, fine. If your taste is more to the sweet, either amend the recipe or use another red sauce that you prefer."
5,Really Good game,This is a really good game. I love being able to swim with the animals and teach the animal tricks. I think this adds on to zoo tycoon 2 really well. it really makes it more interesting. I can play this game for hours with out getting bored. The only bad thing is the walls on the tank get dirty really quickly. But other than that this game is worth you money for sure!!!!!!!!Heather
4,It is interesting,"It takes a long time to train an animal. Even to hire it done. I love the items you can purchase. It is fun, just takes a while to train."
4,Tried a Demo,"You can find the demo of this game in the latest summer Playstation Underground Jampack. Unlike what the editorial review states, this game is still to this day displayed in a low resolution. Granted, the game isn't finished yet, however, Sony would only have a month to change resolutions, which may take more than a month to complete. Still, the gameplay is fun, and definately different. Might be worth checking out, but I'm gonna be careful after such sony bombs as Legend of Dragoon and Dark Cloud."
4,Ico,"Mixed feelings about this one. Overall, I like it; it has a grandiosque dreamy quality to the visuals. Very large scale surroundings but it seems to be a bit foggy and light at times (intentional i'm sure; certainly NOT due to PS2 capabilities)--graphics-wise, I was expecting better. The story is quite original. I do like the fact that there is no health bar to worry about...you 'die' if you fall too far or if the villian shadows capture the girl. Its a puzzle-based game and it can get quite tough at some times (I find myself hitting online playguides). The interface is simple, you can pick it up in about 5 minutes."
4,Wooden Shoes,The makers of this game did a wonderful job paying attention to detail. The landscapes are almost breath taking and and the sounds are very realistic. The play control seems a little choppy to me but that could be expected since he wears little wooden shoes. This game has some great scenes and was fairly fun to play. I wouldn't mind playing through again.
4,Thumbs up!,"This game has its own value to the gamers. Eventhough I found it's frustrating....it still rocks!!Sometimes the girl is not cooperating with me(silly program) though.Overall, this game meets my expectation and so do you."
4,Excellent Puzzle Game,"This game is one of the best I have ever played! The graphics are magnificent and look almost like an oil painting. The music is great and the puzzles can be real mind-benders. All in all, a fantastic game! This may not be everyones piece of cake however... If you don't like to think, then don't get this game! The only bad things about this game are that it lacks story and is very, very short (took about 5 hours!). This game is really great, but you may just want to rent it first!"
5,Best Adventure Game for Non-Pubescent Males,"If you are an adult with lots of responsibility and little time to camp out in front of the TV playing video games, Ico is the adventure game for you. It is true that the game can be completed within 10-15 hours if you NEVER look at a guide book. However, since those of us in this category may only spend 1-5 hours a week playing video games, that's enough to make the game worth our precious hours of game time. The game is simple to learn. No complicated fight combos and fighting is only occasionally warding off ghost. No graphic gore or bouncing breast, making this a good choice for kids and women. Control of Ico is excellent and the storyline is outstanding. The game is worth playing to the end, the VERY END!"
3,Not really worth the money ..,"It's a pretty decent game to play and it's well made but it just too short and has a pretty disappointing ending.If you buy it, don't pay much for it."
1,"Promising game, but BUGGY !!!!!!","This game is a neat puzzle/adventure game, and I liked it except for the fact that it seemed quite BUGGY to me. Quite often the game menu popped up spontaneously during game play. It would not go away until I unplugged my controller and plugged it back in! That got old real fast. However, I was willing to live with that until the game CRASHED during a cut-scene. The letterbox view came up and then I just sat there, waiting forever.In a word.... Unacceptable. Console games CANNOT crash."
4,"I hate this book, yet it is good","I am taking my History capstoneatfor my undergrad and I have to say I hate this book. Appleby, Jacob and Hunt all teach history at UCLA. Not known for it's ultra-liberal persepective. SO they bash the church, white males and consevative historians. THey have done their work and the book is well done. I wish that teachers using this book would show the other persepective of historical progress."
4,A two disk set-for a wonderful afternoon,"The first disk is a rerelease of two ragas recorded in 1955. The first is based on a traditional melody, the second is his own composition. The tabla is played by Chatur Lal. The second disk was recorded in 1994. The two ragas are again a traditional and composed melodies. The tabla is played by Zakir Hussain. The insert is filled with information about his music."
4,Story of a man propelled through life by fate and luck.,"""BEING THERE"", by Jerzy Kosinski was a great read. I could hardly put it down ( not for long though, it is only 118 pages). Kosinski puts together a well thought, interesting story with a very relevant theme. His main character, ""Chance the gardiner"" is an excellent example of kosinski's power of creativity and cleverness. In the story, Chance has been locked away all of his life. One day he is suddenly thrust out into the real world. He has no education, only the nowledge of a garden he has spent his whole life growing. The story shows just how far he gets on luck, fate, pure personality, and his knowledge of the garden, which he uses to answer the complex questions people ask him. It will make you wonder, and question our society. A definite must read for anybody."
4,I think that Being There was a confusing book,"Being There was an interesting book. I liked how Chance always referred to his garden when he didn't understand the topic of conversation. I also found it somewhat confusing. The reason for this is because the author would be talking about politics then Chance would relate to his garden. Overall, the book was very enjoyable and I would recommend it to all my friends. I also liked the hopitality the Ran's gave Chance when he lost his house after the old man died. Another thing I enjoyed was how E.E. began to like Chance."
3,Pick one of Pat Conroy's other titles instead,"It's short and easy, but it's just an okay read. I like books about inspirational teachers, but Pat Conroy spends a little too much time patting himself on the back while criticizing everyone else involved."
2,A Disappointment,It was Free. That's the only positive thing to say about the book. It is now in my Kindle Archives.
2,Fey fo fum,"I guess i am one of the few that was looking for more of the ""merry"" fey type and MORE of that story line than trying to get historical data. It was a nice read but I am Glad it was a free download since i wouldn't want to pay for it. Not a book to read 2x."
5,THE book on camera acting... IF you put work into it.,"I was fortunate enough to have known a personal friend of Tony Barr, and attended on 3 separate occasions a small private training workshop done by Tony himself. I have to say that what you learn in this will mean nothing unless you put the exercises into practice. He was one of the rare teachers that never really told you what to do but knew how to pose questions that got you thinking in his method. The techniques put into practice can have you prepared for a character by the second reading, which is an invaluable asset in the hasty Hollywood environment. The techniques are based upon how real life works. The simple concept of listening, motivation, and crossing the bridge are invaluable to writers, animators, filmmakers & any profession of understanding interaction. Even though I am giving this book 5 stars, after being there with the author it is light years ahead to put this into practice, or even attend the Film Actors Workshop."
3,Snowlove,"Good book, however I bought it for my little sister who is learning acting... and this is for pros. People who already know how to act and need extra tips.A little worn out, but it's to be expected since it's a second hand book, other than that, it's good!"
1,Paver advertisement,"I purchased this based on the 4 star review it received, but it was a huge disappointment. Every single photo in this book is taken directly from a paver catalog, which you can get for free. And they all start to look the same after a page or two. It is just the same configurations against different backgrounds. The captions under the photos were the only text in the book and they were pretty bland. I have been reading a lot of home and garden design books as research for a project and this book was by far the worst I have seen."
3,Need new singer!,This cd has some good music on it but the vocals need to change. Try being original instead of ripping off past greats like Danzig. Build your own legacy and be original. Stop killing music with con artists.
2,Was a let down.,"I seen this movie on Amazon and was anxious to see it because I am a major Don Knotts fan. All the other Don Knotts films are on DVD and I wondered why this one wasn't. So, I ended up ordering an extremely old verison to check it out. All I can say is it was a major let down and I realize why this company never bothered to put it back out on DVD. If you are a Don Knotts fan I suggest watching the Ghost and Mr. Chicken instead. It is a lot better movie.This movie tried really hard to be funny but somehow it just doesn't make you laugh. I really thought it was just a werid and an actually pretty boring movie."
2,Dissapointed,"The writing is fairly decent, however the author's reading of the material is hard to tolerate. The thick New York accent detracts from the material being read. I would not recommend the audio book."
1,cheap diffuser,I bought three of these lights from Home Depot for a finished basement. During installation one of the clips that holds the diffuser in place punched a hole in it. Now it doesn't hang properly. The acrylic diffuser is really cheap and very easy to damage. Home Depot does not carry replacement diffusers and I have not found a source for a replacement on the web. A real disappointment coming from Litonia. Guess you can't trust that name anymore.
2,"Good Product Advice, Bad Color Choices","Paula Begoun does give some good advice on products in this book. However, I must disagree in her assessment of what makeup colors a woman should and shouldn't wear. I don't believe that EVERYONE should stick to neutral shades and avoid blues and greens or other ""unnatural"" colors anywhere in their makeup. She adds this well intentioned but horrific photo spread of herself, showing how to put on makeup. The demonstration only helps to make her look muddy, flat and uninteresting. The excellent classic ""Color Me Beautiful"" by Carole Jackson is a better choice for makeup colors. Go for the rest of her advice but skip the color recommendations."
3,Interesting but too short.,"Ghosts of the Carolina Coasts is just what it said it is on the cover - stories about haunted lighthouses, haunted plantations, haunted historic sites, people who went missing, mysteries and other unknowns. But at just over 150 pages there is very little meat on the bones. It took me only a few hours to read and each story is nothing but a simple story - no details, just the simple facts that take up two or three pages."
1,Disappointing!,"I was disappointed in this book! The writer simply failed to interest me with her tales. The stories, which were only about a page or two each, seemed to be written more for a child rather than an adult; they were too short and lacking in detail. I read a few of the stories and then tossed the book aside. My greatest regret was that I'd paid nearly 10 bucks for this book. There are many other much better true ghost story books out there. If you're looking for some truly chilling tales, start with Haunted Heartland, Historic Haunted America, or USA Weekend's, I Never Believed in Ghosts Until..."
4,From the cover,"From the back of the book:The author invites readers to explore the dramatic story of Jesus which Matthew tells. He connects that story to the first-century world of its author and early readers. The commentary then shows how Matthew has shaped the church and still speaks to the life of the Christian community. Much of this presentation of Matthew was developed and tested in Christian education settings. The book helps readers wrestle with Jesus' gospel and mission, starting small, but for all nations."
1,Horrid Crap,"This band along with GC, Simple Plan, etc. make me sick. The whiny vocals are enpugh to give me a migrane coupled with their lyrcis is truly a horrible thing. Why do you people listen to this crap?Send hate mail to Auragorn@aol.com, hahaha."
4,A Must Listen From The Midwest. . .,"The All-American Reject's debut album is an amazing refreshment of pop/punk tunes that captivate all those open to new sounds. I love the fact that their style is a little left of center. Tunes like ""My Paper Heart"" and ""Your Star"" lift spirits and motivate minds. This CD is definetly a must buy. I can't stop listening to it, and I know that others will agree. And Good Charlotte loves them, so join the club and pick up the album! BE A FAN!:-D"
4,aar are great,"i really love this cd. it has good songs with great lyrics (i think they say ""i beseech you"" in one line, kinda odd but hey!)all the songs are great to listen to and all have different sounds, unlike a lot of rock bands we see today. they use more instuments than the normal bass guitar and drums in a few songs, and the lead singer has a really good vioce (and he is really cute!) the only thing i didn't like about this cd is that every song is about love girls and breakups, though every song is distinctive.i would definetly recomend this cd."
4,Really Good,"This is a really good album, most of the songs are great and if you like that kind of punk-rock style, this is a great album to own."
2,Rejects?,"Being an Oklahoman, I've had this whole album, especially ""Paper Heart"" and ""Swing Swing"", shoved down my throat by the local radio stations and friends with bad taste for months now. The All-American Rejects are typical corporate rock, catchy and generic licks, a whiny 12-year old lead singer, all-american boy looks, songs about love and pseudo-angst, and the worst drum beats I've ever heard. Check out the drum part on ""Paper Heart""- it sounds like it should be on the Flashdance soundtrack. Bland, wholesome, corporate rock fun."
3,"YOU MAY JUST WANNA REJECT THE ""ALL AMERICAN REJECTS"", but...","um well. to tell you the truth i bought the record because that dang song got in my head, and it was [$$$]at walmart. so yes it is worth [$$$], but i think it was only for today only.the record is trite, and contrived. you know for a fact that these boys have never had a single expierience that they sing on the album, but the clever power chord accompanied by synth effects works. until the 6th song where you find yourself growing tired of the same pattern.a note to the rejects: experiment.EMO IS A DRAG. but a few of the tunes, probably 4 or 5 of them are decent, maybe even fun. so for [$$$] it is a gem. but don't count on them. and don't pay over [$$$] dollars for the record.the biggest let down is the fact that they thank the lyndsay diaries in their liner notes. :("
5,All-American Rejects are a hit,"I picked up a copy of The All-American Rejcts album on day one and It's been playing non-stop in my cd player ever since. Where ever I go the album goes and I'm always singing their tunes through out the day. This album is a must have for any All-American Rejects fan out there. My favorite tracks are Swing, Swing, My Paper Heart, One More Sad Song, and Too Far Gone. The whole album is awesome but those would have to be my favorites. Once the guys hit my area I'll be sure to check them out live on tour! Awesome job on the album guys!"
5,Rockin' Good CD!,"The All-American Rejects are one of those bands you NEVER get tired of listening to, and this CD shows it. Every single song I love pressing ""Repeat"" to on my CD player. This CD I recommend if you have the slightest interest in anything that isn't classical, country, rap,or jazz. This CD (of course) isn't Bach, but even my parents enjoy it (a rarity!). So no matter your age, you can jam to this one! :)"
5,rock on rejects,"I found out about the All-American Rejects from the webmaster of a Something Corporate website. I downloaded ""One More Sad Song"" first and I loved it so I proceeded to download more and I'm telling you, this band is amazing. They have a truly unique sound, unlike any other band I've heard of. The lyrics aren't bad either, they've got that emo-ness that I love. After downloading all the songs off their album, I still went out and bought the enhanced one when it came out. Although I was a little bit disappoined at first because the sound was definitely different than before, it grew on me and now I just put on my AAR album and rock out in my room. :D The All-American Rejects is a great band and they've definitely got potential."
5,"Don't ""Reject"" this CD","The all - american rejects is an awesome band! This cd is enhanced and includes the hit single swing swing and many more awesome songs that you'll love. One listen to this cd and you'll be hooked on it. You'll have this cd in your boombox or discman for days. BUY IT! So don't ""Reject"" this cd."
5,A Must-Buy For Your Collection,[...] I ended up falling in love with the catchy lyrics and upbeat rhythms. This CD will have you singing along by your second time listening to it. I recommend it to all!
4,Not bad!,"I hate New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, etc. I love All American Rejects. What can I say? Instead of bands trying to sound like they're making music, every single one of AAR's songs just click. Everything works; the lyrics, the melodies, the vocals. Do not dismiss it as pop. It's one of those rare albums that appeals to a wide variety of audiences, except for those determined to hate it."
4,Good CD with multi-generational appeal,"This CD belongs to my 15 year-old son, and I find myself borrowing it quite a bit. These songs have very catchy tunes. Good, clean, upbeat rock with a fast-pop beat. Good guitar and vocals.No bad cuts here, some of the more noteworthy: Swing Swing; Time Stands Still; Why Worry; My Paper Heart. Sure, a common theme of the lyrics is failed love, but this is no different than it was in most of the music we baby-boomers grew up with. This release should have broad, multi-generational appeal.If you are a fellow boomer, looking for something new and fresh, but a little less edgy than, say... Linkin Park (I could swear Sam Kinison was back assisting them with vocals) give the Rejects a listen. And be prepared to share it with your teenager."
2,Punk or Pop?,"Look, we all know that the rejects managed to catch a radio hit with ""swing, swing"". And because of that song, i ended up wasting $$$ on this ... cd!Literaly, the only good songs are ""Swing,Swing"" ""One More Sad Song"" ""The Last Song"". EVERY other song on this ... !Everything about ""Drive Away"" makes my skin crawl.The lyrics are questionable(to say the least) and punk doesnt work for the rejects. Mind you if ""my paper heart"" is anything to go by, niether does pop!All in all, do NOT buy this album. If you absolutely must have it then download it!But do NOT under any circumstances pay more than nothing for this worthless pice of plastic!"
1,horrible,The all american rejects are rejects. get it. Ha ha. This cd is horrible horrible horrible and if you buy it youre an idiot fool.
5,cd worth buying,great cd! has the best lyrics and swing swing is a great just-dumped song. time stands still is a great song with great lyrics too. the all-american rejects rock! this is a cd worth buying.
4,NOT LIKE GOOD CHARLOTTE,"Many people compare AAR to Good Charlotte and Simple Plan. They're flat out wrong. Tyson Ritter's vocals and lyrics separate him and the band from punk rockers. They're not poppish but rock and they experiment with different sounds, like the organ in ""Swing Swing"" The lyrics are catchy and Ritter sings with emotion. I like the cd, but I would listen to them on their website http://www.allamericanrejects.com/ before buying it"
2,ugh HORRIBLE DONT BUY IT THERE EMO!,"well when i got this CD for chirstmas i was excited because i really liked there song ""Swing Swing"" but when i listend to the whole cd i thought what the hell!? I mean all there songs are about crying and girls so clearly they are AWFULL song writers...totally emo!!! The only other song i liked was ""The Last Song"" The all american rejects are really rejects!! dont buy there cd its really bad!!!!!"
1,"If you have any taste, don't buy this CD........","I know that most people reading this have probably heard the song ""Swing Swing"" on MTV. Given that some of the songs may be catchy at first, they are ultimately bland and uninspiring. The best comparison I can think for their music is Disney's ""It's a Small World"" song: catchy at first, but it drives you crazy from listening to it. Their music is mostly the same recycled stuff MTV shoves down peoples throats all of the time. There is no originality to it whatsoever. There are plenty of bands that I don't particularly like their music, but I can respect what they are doing for their originality and style. This is not true for the All American Rejects who have no talent at all and need to be avoided at all costs. On a side note, I have seen them in concert and they were jerks to the crowd and put on a lousy show. It's sad when the band doesn't even seem to be enjoying their own music."
3,"""My paper heart will bleed...""","The All-American Rejects self-titled album was quite good when it was released in 2003 but hearing it now, this band isn't as talented as I thought they were. The lead singer's voice is pretty nasal and childish but the band can play their instruments really well so that makes up for the monotone singing. Songs that I do still enjoy include: My Paper Heart, Happy Endings, Time Stands Still, Your Star, Swing Swing, and The Last Song. I have to admit a lot of the tracks sound like one big song so that is why I give this album 3 stars. It's a good try but not a solid debut from America's favorite ""rejects."""
4,Battery charger,"It was exactly what I needed, small and it fits easily into the camera bagI'm glad I ordered it."
4,This is an Ok Sword,"What you see, is what you get. It's an nice Katana. True, there may be some scratches on the blade, and it does shake in the handle. But overall, it's a very nice piece of work, and it arrived very quickly. I was very impresses. Please note, that the blade is UNSHARPENED. This fact may disappoint some of you, however mayI suggest the Ophidian Katana or Ophidian Katana Set. I have not yet received this Katana, but it's description is that it's ""razor sharp."" Once I recieve it, I will write a review"
1,Worst... Book... Ever....,"Unfortunately, I am forced to give this book one star, since there is no lower rating. This is possibly the worst book ever written. The writing quality is low, the similies are horrible and the alliteration is forced. Synonyms for standard peices of military gear includeGrenades - death ballsfiring a clip of ammunition on automatic - commie caliber deathThis is a book that was written for the teen age male crowd in the late 80's and failed to reach its target market."
2,Cute BUT....,"this did not work well for our room. Though it is cute, I would not recommend. It did not help out for my sons congestion, left the room feeling cooler but did not get the sense that their was any moisture to help out his little nose. Gets dirty quickly and if you miss a day or 2 without cleaning, it starts to smell up the room. Don't put it up too high cause it can start to leak.We're going to try to a warm mist one instead."
2,Defective Hello Kitty batch??,"I've just purchased 3 crane humidifiers (frog, elephant, and hello kitty). All run fine but the hello kitty one. The first one I received has a sticker on the bottom of the tank pointing to the nebulizer. It was not working at all and I guess this is a returned defective one and they don't even bother to fix it and repackaged it and sell it like new again! Then I did an exchange and guess what, the next one I received runs only about an hour and the nebulizer stopped working! I hope this is just an isolated incidence and others who got the hello kitty one will have better experience than mine. If you want a more stable one, choose frog or elephant. Though hello kitty is quite cute for girls!"
4,Cute & easy to use,"After reading many reviews, we finally bought this for our kids' nursery. It's not as loud as I expected and provides just a quiet kind of white noise. I like that it has a good range for its output - light mist for regular use; heavier mist for nights when we have the heater on and the air is unusually dry. Our twins used to do a little dry cough periodically but once we got this humidifier, it seems like that's gone away! It's pretty easy to clean and so far, we haven't had issues with mold. It also helped on a couple of really warm nights, as we used the humidifier in conjunction with a fan. I think it really helped keep the room cool for the kiddies."
1,Heighly Unreliable,"I bought this unit two months before. It worked great until now. Two weeks before it started blowing vapor from bottom and stopped pushing vapor from its mouth. Today it completely stopped working, would not make any vapor. It does not know anymore that it has water and always has empty tank indicator when the water is in the tank.It was great while it worked. But it is highly unreliable. It wasn't very expensive to buy on the bright side."
2,The inside plastic melted,"The humidifier worked fine for a couple of weeks. The design looks pretty cool and our 2 year old daughter loved it. The cold steam that comes out is visible, and that gives a pretty good feeling that its working.But, once we forgot to switch it off and it kept running without water for sometime at night. That melted the plastic at the bottom that holds water, and making this completely useless."
1,"Hard to hold the water container, breaks easily","Summary: container oddly shaped, and made of a flimsy blend of plastic; bet you'll crack it in a few weeks.I have large hands, I usually have a hard time finding gloves that fit, and I am quite dextrous too. Having said that, I had a really hard time handling the water container of the cow shaped humidifier. It has a handle, but you can only use it when the container is empty. And, when you fill it with water, you have wrap your hands around upside down the half dome. Well after barely 1 week of use, one night the *empty* container slipped from my hands, and cracked.Good luck holding on to yours if you get the cow humidifier.We also got the hello kitty for the other room, that one is somewhat easier to handle."
1,Disappointed!,"I purchased the Crane Penguin 1 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier and received the product in 4 days. Once I filled the water in the tank and placed the tank on the base, I noticed all of the water was leaking from the bottom of the base. I tried this again to see if I did something wrong by putting the tank on the base, but again the water started to leak out from the bottom of the base including where the power cord is attached to the base. I have asked for a refund will try to find some other brand that have better ratings."
4,Impressed so far,"Everything about this cool mist humidifier is great, except for a little inconvenience with refill. It's adorable, doesn't run out of water even after a day and night (on a lower setting), it's almost silent, and fits well in smaller spaces. Only downside is that refill is a little tricky, because of the penguin-shaped top (when you turn it upside down to refill, you can't set it down in your sink). Recommended."
2,"Junky and cheap, but cute.","This thing is defInitely cute, I'll grant them that. But it's 3am and both of my children have croup. The baby has the frog in his room and the older boy has a humidifier from the 80's that my mom used for me when I was a child. Guess who is in his crib hacking his brains out because there is absolutely no moisture in his air? The poor baby. The older humidifier works like a dream after 30 years. The frog puts out mist, but it falls to the ground after about 3 inches. And more importantly, it simply isn't humidifying the room. It's done nothing for him and I've had it. It's going out with the trash tomorrow."
2,problem with mildew,"The humidifier was placed on a table in the bedroom next to the bassinet. After a few days of intermittent use the bedding was mildewed.I would not purchase again, prefer to have the baby in the bathroom with steam."
3,Don't be fooled,"I purchased this humidifier a few months back. The first month was perfect - even the light on the front and the trickling noise didn't bother me. I wrote a great review and posted it.About one month into owning this cute humidifier I noticed that when it was turned to full blast, by morning there was water puddled underneath it. Thank goodness I had set it inside a plastic pan or my wooden table would be ruined. The next night I turned the humidifier to only half output and for a few days everything was great. However within four or so days it started to leak even then. Since then it has been pretty much the same: me putting it at a smaller output and finding it still leaks.Do not let this product fool you. I did months of research and was suprised to find this particular humidifier with the best reviews and at such an affordable price. Now I understand why it was so cheap."
2,This humidifier only gets the second star because it's so cute,"I have to admit that I bought the frog humidifier mostly because it is cute, and it matches my son's room. I was happy with it initially, but the product started working poorly after about a year. The humidifier is not long for this world. The motor is really loud now, and almost sounds like it's grinding. Some nights it is so loud that we can't use it. It is only a matter of time before it stops working altogether. If you replace these types of items after 1 year, I guess it's a great buy. I certainly expected for it to last long enough for my son to go to preschool."
2,Not Durable,Bought this for my sons room. Cool concept and very appealing to children but not constructed well. Had it for one month and was refilling tank one day and it slipped in the sink- wouldn't even say I dropped it- and plastic tank cracked. Now its completly unusable and replacement tank is almost as much as buying another one. That is most disappointing of all when parts cost as much as item itself. Not ideal unless you're ok with things breaking easily.
5,Love the Cow!!,I got the Cow last year for my daughter. It's been wonderful when she has cold. I put it on in her room at night. It's so quiet!!! Sometimes my daughter has coughing fits in the middle of the night. Not anymore since I put on the humidifier!!! It's been wonderful.Now I'm back because my other daughter wants one as well. This time we are getting a frog!!
3,cute,"we love the cute pink piggy. It's not as loud as our former one, so it's more suitable in the bedroom"
2,"Lovely, but only lasted a week!","I really liked this humidifier as did my 2 1/2 year old. It pumps out moisture well and raises the humidity even in a large room.BUT.... and it's a big but... the nebulizer stopped working after a week (it first started putting out large droplets then stopped altogether) I returned it and didn't get another one after seeing that many have had similar issues. If quality issues could be addressed, would be a great product."
3,Not bad for the price,"This item is not bad, for the price. The first one I ordered was defective, so I was sent a replacement very quickly by Amazon (I love Amazon's customer service). An almost full tank of water does last for more than 12 hrs, so you're not constantly worried about re-filling. The mist is strong enough, so crank it up if you have a very large room. Overall, easy to use product."
2,Good Bye Kitty!!! Disappointed Kitty!!!,"Got the ""Hello Kitty"" humidifier and just loved the looks of it. However it only worked for 1 night and a few hours, the second night it had stopped when I woke!I am really bummed, because I could feel the difference it made.So this one goes back, but maybe I'll try and reorder again, as I need one. From the reviews a few other people had to try more than once to get a good one!I usually have no complaint with the stuff I buy here and I am a very frequent customer, so this is unusual.So anyway just for FYI"
1,Broken,Piece of junk. Plugged it in nothing happened. No light no sound no humidifying. This is just a waste of time.
4,Much better than my old humidifier!,"Cute design and super quiet. My old humidifier was so loud you could hear it from downstairs when it was running in an upstairs bedroom. This one is so quiet you barely know it's on when you are standing right next to it. The on light is not very bright so it doesn't interfere with sleep. The dial allows you to adjust exactly the amount of mist you want. My only complaint is that after you clean it it takes a couple of days to completely dry out. But, maybe all humidifiers are the same way."
1,water leaking,"The tiger shape is cute and my daughter likes it. But if I turn the mist to maximum, the water leaks. I kept it on all night long to keep my room humid, and I always woke up with a lot of water around the humidifier in the morning. Disappointed! I will soon replace it because I'm tired of cleaning the water from my floor every morning."
4,"fun design, my son love it","I was a little apprehensive about buying this product...usually the ""cutesy"" electronic devices seem to die out pretty quickly. We have been using this non-stop for about a month and it seems to be doing well for us. My son loves the design and can't stop saying ""ooooowwwwllll"" every time he sees it.I only have two gripes. The LED on the front is wicked bright, so we covered it with duct tape...and the inside of this thing is a little tricky to clean so we are following the instructions to soak in vinegar/water and that seems to be doing the job so far.Overall, I would recommend this to a friend."
3,Dragon not quite as good as Elephant!,"We ordered the dragon humidifier for the babies room - we both liked the look of it but it was so BRIGHT to put on our own bedstand! Pleasantly surprised when we got it - it is just as red but not obnoxious - we wanted it back for our room then LOL. However, we have the Elephant in our room and it works great - really pushes the steam up and out. The dragon pushes the steam out holes behind the eyes (it looks very cool) but it tends to drop down very fast. Would absolutely recommed IF you can put it up high. We use the demineralization cartridges because our water eats everything - they seem to work pretty well and the units create minimal 'dust'. Overall happy with it - but be aware the Elephant you might get away with putting on the floor or low down, but the Dragon needs to be up higher!"
1,"CANNOT be set on carpet, floor, or wooden furniture - so where do you put it?","Just pulled this thing out of the package (the frog model) and discovered what is NOT spelled out on the outside packaging: that it cannot be set directly on carpet, floor, or wooden furniture because the cool mist comes out the BOTTOM of this model. WTF??? Who thought this was a good idea? Think about it: the only way for this thing to function completely effectively is to set it up on top of an open structure of some kind. (Because cold falls, heat rises -- so the cool mist will go *downward*, not up to where my child lies sleeping.) Do I have any openwork structure like that in my house to set it on? (I guess you could use one of those plastic milk crates.) At ten-thirty at night, do I want to go wandering around looking for something appropriate to set this thing on? No, I do not. Crane, some bachelor engineer must have designed this thing for you! I'm returning it ASAP."
4,"Does the job, quiet, easy to maintain","pros: It's aesthetically pleasing, quiet, doesn't require a filter, and only has to be refilled once every couple dayscons: You have to take the head and body out in order to refill it, since the cap is on the bottom of the unit. It'd be cool if the cap was on the top so you could fill it without taking it apart."
4,pretty good so far,"It's very powerful, increases humidity for both my living room and bedroom quickly (about 520 square feet).I have just used it a few times. It's pretty good so far."
3,its ok,"the product itself is cute and all, but there are a few things that i didnt like.. i was under the impression that it automatically shut off when out of water but it has not done that. i got it to help my newborn with her congestion but i really dont think that it makes a difference at all. other than that it is ok. shipping was fairly quick and it is really cute"
1,Did not last too long,I have had the penguin humidifier for a year and it stopped working already.What a waste of money.It leaks a lot and the red light always comes on which means there is something wrong with it.Do not buy the penguin humidifier.
1,"Might be cute, but the humidifier fails after 2 month","I bought the penguin humidifier when my daughter had a cold. My wife and I picked it out, because it was cute, and a decent price.Every time we filled it, (and yes we followed all instructions with the unit) the output knob had to be adjusted, so that mist would come out. This just kept getting worse and worse. After about 60 days (using it only at night) the unit quit working.Evidently Crane does not exist on the internet, nor can you actually find who makes these units, to try to get a replacement.All in all a complete waste of $30. Dont get it. Get something more expensive, and a brand name you can trust."
1,Thomas Humidifier,"I should have looked at the reviews before buying. My son loved being able to have Thomas in his room. However, much like the other two reviewers giving this a bad review, the plastic light piece on my tank also disengaged and fell into the water tank after very limited use. I was hoping there might be some way to fix it (as I figured it out before putting it on the base unit) but because I can't reach the piece, I have no hope of using waterproof glue to reattach. I agree that this is a major hazzard and the product should be recalled."
1,"Cute, nice but didn't last 2 months!!!","Makes me sick. This lasted 2 months tops. I loved it if it would have lasted. Going back to Vicks, a product I know and trust."
3,Should Not Be A Night Light,"Wanted to test before putting in nursery. The light bulb gives off a pink glow and the green LED 'on' light is very bright. Had to tape over the green light with black tape and removed the main bulb so I don't have a glow throughout the night. Instructions tell me not to place unit on wood, towel, cloth, etc. Legs are quite stubby for proper air intake from the bottom, hence those instructions."
2,"Cute Yes, Quiet No","I've owned a Vicks vaporizer before that steamed the water and I thought that was noisy.This Crane humidifier just took the World Guinness Record for noisiest humidifying device. As I bought this for baby's room it's entirely too loud, it sounds like there is a traction engine in there.The mist comes out just fine and yes the unit is pretty cute, but I'm afraid the noise is too much and this unit is being returned ASAP."
1,LEAKS,"This humidifier started to leak shortly after purchase, and even with a fair amount of effort to fix it, we were never able to stop it from leaking. Very cheap construction."
1,Broke in 2 weeks,"It just stopped working after 2 weeks, i should've listened to people who said that on reviews... we kept the head part of the penguin caz kids loved it, the plastic penguin head pice was $50, i guess. pretty expensive!"
2,Mist hovered around sponge bob,"The steam/vapor never rises above Sponge Bob's Head. This humidifier will not help anyone. It's very poor, and we don't recommend it to anyone. The only thing that is great about this humidifier, is the night light. sorry."
4,good humidifier,"this is a good humidifier. if you have hard water you have to purchase a filter and replace it i think every 3 months. if you dont use a filter you will get white powder all over the place.... but other than that, which is my water's fault...i like it...and it's cute."
5,My true love,"THIS IS THE CUTEST LITTLE THING EVER!! i am 28 years old and i live by myself, call me crazy but this is the best thing i've ever invested in. Works great, easy to clean, looks adorable. Friends who come over love it."
3,OK,"First one broke in a couple of days, but Amazon quickly replaced it. Works well now and right price. I would recommend for those looking for an inexpensive humidifier."
1,It stopped working after one month,I ordered the product at October and then it stopped working just after one month. Please check other people's review before you order it.
1,Broken. Terrible Customer Service,"Item did not work despite being brand new. Called Crane and they sent me other parts which did NOT fix the problem. Took two days to get a hold of them, no one answers the phone at their customer service line. After two weeks, multiple phone calls and extra parts being shipped I asked for a refund and I was told they ""don't do refunds"" and I have to send the product's power cord back and they will send me a new product. Quite frankly I'm not interested in a product that doesn't work, nor did I buy the product anticipating a two to three week issue. We actually needed the humidifier so I had to go out and buy another brand (which works wonderfully). Maybe my product is a fluke but I was utterly unimpressed by the customer service"
1,"Broken and VERY Poor ""Customer Service""","This penguin while quite adorable, did not work and therefore became not so adorable. It did not function what so ever. When I called the 800 number as I was told to in the trouble shooting guide, I was only left with the option to leave a message. After doing so twice over the course of a day or two with no return call, I decided just to try a few more times not leaving a message but hanging up instead when I reached the machine. Aparently annoyed by my calling, a very rude man told me to stop calling and hanging up! Wow! What a horrible company this was to deal with, and I would recommend you stay clear as well."
3,Worked 1 year with no care,"This misted well for one year and we probably used it almost daily for 4-6 months. We did not clean it in any special way, nor use any filters. Last week, it stopped misting although everything sounded like it was working. We then cleaned it with white vinegar per the instructions and tried everything else the manual suggested. I left it running for about 15 minutes and then the motor or fan stopped."
4,Cool Mist Humidifer,The humidifier is small in size but does a very good job of humidifying bedroom. Easy to fill and care for.
1,Horrible built product leaks all the time,"You can not move this item after putting water in it. Even after use when the water is all used up, it continues to spill when moved. Horrible design."
3,The dragon wasn't the best choice,"I got the dragon based purely, of course, on how awesome dragons are. I wish I would have gotten the penguin in the video review that somebody else did, due to the direction that that one shot the vapor. I thought the dragon would be like the penguin and direct the vapor up and away, perhaps out of the nose. Instead, the vapor comes out of.... the top of the eyelids?? Yep, the top of the eyelids. Pretty unique dragon in that regard. The result, aside from the failed aesthetics, is that the vapor goes straight up and falls on the dragon & the surface you placed it on, and gets redirected easily by the slightest of air currents. If I had the penguin, I could have directed the vapor to go right over my sleeping head. Instead, I get a wet nightstand, even after standing it atop a one foot tall box, which, incidentally, I never wanted on my nightstand but now must be there to help mitigate the moisture problem."
4,Wonderful humidifier,"IT pretty much does what it sets out to do provide a easy to use and maintain, cute humidifier for small areas. It's perfect for the baby's crib area, and keeps the baby fascinated too because of it's bright color.It requires regular cleaning and maintenance, but so do all humidifiers.There are a couple of things to be taken care of like using it off the floor and not placing it on a carpeted surface (both requirements ensure a good airflow) -- so read the instruction manual thoroughly.I recommend it."
2,"Cute, but lots of problem units!","The first one we received didn't work: no mist whatsoever.The second one puts out a mist but even on the high setting it is so slight that it does not add any humidity to the room.At this point, 4 months into owning it, we cannot recommend it and are very disappointed - you're better off with a cool mist for $15 from the drug store."
1,"Nice for a year, but then broke","Worked fine last year, but it just stopped working recently. Used it for a total for 4 months, probably. Buy a better humidifier!"
1,Potential safety hazard,"I read the negative reviews and choose to ignore them. Bad mistake. Yes it looks cute and yes it performs ok while it works. However after only a half dozen nights, it stops working, making a weird gurgling sound. The worst part is that then the water started to overflow from the base and leaked everywhere in the room. Imagine almost 1 Gl of water pouring on your furniture, floor and over an electric appliance connected to the outlet. Kinda scary picture in a baby's room. Read other reviews. Does not seem like an isolated incident. Seems like a potential product defect."
2,Cute but poor quality.,"I've gone through two penguins and one frog. They last for several months and then spring leaks. No visible cracks that could be caulked; one minute they work fine, the next the floor is covered with water. So far I haven't had a problem with the Sunbeam 1120."
1,doesn't work at all,"Please don't purchase this humidifier at all. Only if I could give it a ZERO STAR!!! it has been no longer than 3 months before it totally broke down...Even if I tune to the highest mist, nothing comes out of it. At the beginning, it worked and then it didn't work at all. I was really disappointing coz it's not a cheap one. And I didn't use it often. I don't recommend it at all, please don't waste your money!"
2,"Good humidifier, but didn't last","I bought the frog humidifier back in 2008 and it's still working great. When we had another child I got another one for his room, because we liked the first one so much. This time I got the penguin. Worked great until last week, now it doesn't have any mist come out. I am very disappointed in how long it's lasted, less than 10 months, and we didn't use it that often (only when he was congested)."
3,First humidifier,"Well I work in the HVAC field so I know about humidity. I haven't taken a meter to my room yet to measure the actual humidity level on and off but I think my morning dry throat has been lessened since using it. It's a piece of cake to use. I have city water so I don't get dust. I fill it every two days with it on the medium setting. I rinse it with bleach every two weeks, no sign of algae. I'm a 25 year old dude and I don't mind that it's a cow. His name is Phil."
1,really wanted to like it!,I really wanted to like the hello kitty humidifier. It was going to look great in my daughter's room. I tried so hard to like it that we tried 3 of them! Each one of them left a big puddle of water on her night stand. I called the company after the first one and they said that it sounded like the motor wasn't working correctly there for not sending the mist up high enough in the room. So we returned it and tried again. Same problem! I thought it must have been the 'lot' so I went to Target and purchased a third unit. Not only did the third one leave a puddle on the table but it wouldn't turn off without unplugging it from the wall. We bought the Crane 'Frog' and it is working beautifully. But it doesn't look as cute in my little girls room!
2,Works but useless,"You can see the mist coming out, but, there is no change to humidity even 5 feet away from it. Returned and bought a warm mist humidifier"
2,BEWARE OF RUST,"The thing works, but BEWARE of rust! The spring which holds the holding tank closed while upside down started rusting after a few weeks of overnight use. After four weeks I saw that the remaining water in the basin was red tinted and noticeable rust stains from airborne rust were all inside the unit. I took out the spring so I just need to rapidly turn it over and put it on after refilling. But i was shocked to learn I was pumping rust filled air into the babies room!"
4,Excellent customer service from Crane,I emailed Crane to let them know that a little plastic piece on the thomas water reservoir broke after one year's use and they are sending me another reservoir free of charge!That's awesome service!
2,Not enough umph,Maybe I made a mistake with trying to go with a humidifier that has a fun look. The mist just doesn't get out far enough into the air and after using it a couple times I've let it sit for a few weeks.Recommend spending the extra money and getting the normal box type.
3,IT is noisy,"It is cute alright. but it is quite noisy, at least to me. Mine stopped working after only 3 months."
2,broke very quickly,"I liked it very much ,but it is already broken .It keeps going to the red light and at the same time it is full of water.When the red light is on does not work.I am very disappointed. It worked only a few weeks."
2,"WHEN it works, it's great.","i bought this humidifier almost 2 years ago when i was pregnant. originally it was for my daughter's room. i used it when i got sick while i was pregnant...it was in use almost constantly for 1 week. then i cleaned it and stored it...when i got it back out to use it once my daughter was here, it wouldn't work. there are no broken parts and no obstructions. it just won't turn on anymore."
2,terrible,I'll go with the pro's first....Its cute and blows lots of cool mist. Thats it.The cons: It is MESSY. Its awkward to dump. There is no place to hold it right. Water spills out every time I dump it all over the place. It leaves the surface I put it on soaking wet from the mist. I have to bring a towel with me and wipe it down. Its hard to clean the inside. After 2 uses pink mildew was already starting to build(which is probably from my city water hardness etc..) When you set it back on the stand water leaks and spills everywhere...To sum this product up it is just plain messy. My kids love the looks though.
5,"Fantastic product, quiet and very fine mist","I am very impressed with the Crane Hello Kitty humidifier for my baby's room. I've previously tried several others, Vicks, Honeywell brands purchased from Target stores. First thing I noticed with those are the low fan noises that I can't stand. The Crane unit is whispering quiet, and I believe they're all ultrasonic units, so no fans inside. I use only distilled water, so should require less cleaning. The mist is so fine, it does not leave any moisture on the furnitures around, which is also something that other brands can't do. Overall, I am very impressed with this unit and for the price ~$38, it's great! I am ordering a 2nd unit, the penquin for my own room."
2,Do not buy the elephant,I bought both the panda and the elephant. The panda has two holes in which the mist can come out so it works great. The elephants trunk is not a big enough hole so its leaks out of the sides. I do not recommend the elephant and would stick with an animals that has two holes for the mist to escape out of. I am returning it today!
2,Stopped working,I purchased the frog one year ago. I had problems with it off and on and now it doesn't work at all. No vapor. Cute but not worth the money if it doesn't work!
2,meh,"I bought one of these for my son (a red dragon version) and it's great. I love it. This Hello Kitty one though is rubbish. Sometimes we turn it on and it works, sometimes it doesn't and when it doesn't it makes this really loud whirring sound that wakes up the baby (and anyone in either of the rooms next to hers). It's done this since we got, we should have sent it back but never got around to it in time."
1,Did not work at all,"I just received this product and it was defective--did not work at all. It actually looked like the box had been opened. Maybe it was a previous return that was not taken out of inventory. Anyway, whatever the reason this is poor quality control.I am returning it and trying again."
2,Poor quality,"Bought this product less than a year ago and used it for a few months during winter at which time it worked without any problems. Recently, it stopped working for no reason. The motor inside started making funny noises and no vapor comes out. We stopped using it to prevent a fire hazard. It is a cute product but quality is very poor. Will try to contact with the manufacturer to see if we can have it replaced or get a refund (which I doubt!!!)"
3,"Good product, but too low and too cute...","I've found that this humidifier needs to be on an elevated surface -- say, a low table or dresser, otherwise the floor/carpet gets wet. This causes a bit of a tripping hazard with the cord, especially as a Thomas the Tank Engine humidifier is usually used around kids.A further issue: this humidifier is so cute and toylike that I have a hard time preventing my toddler and baby from not playing with it (which is a bad idea -- it is, after all, an electrical appliance containing water. That being said, they do love watching the 'smoke' coming out of the choo-choo.As far as humidification goes, it does a fine job for an average size kids bedroom."
2,water sensor was wrong!,"although cute, not nearly as good as my penguin crane humidifier i bought a few years ago. maybe they changed them a little, but the red light was always on. i had to jiggle the machine to get the green light back. returned it to bed bath where i got it and am now testing out the duck. they didnt have the penguin!"
2,Horrible Humidifier - cheap Vicks one works better,"This humidifier is horrible. First of all, it is made of the #7 plastic that has all the toxins including BPA. Why are corporations allowed to use this in children's products?????I left the thing on all night and when I went to check on my son, I noticed no noticeable difference in the humidity and my carpet was soaking wet. All of the mist went up and then straight down into the carpet.I didn't have good luck with this humidifier. Good luck to you if you decide to purchase it. I know others have liked it, but it just didn't work for us."
2,Cute but useless,"I originally bought this humidifier because it was inexpensive and had a small footprint (ok, fine, and it's cute). However, after using it for about a week I found that I wasn't getting any benefits that are supposed to come with a humidifier. I put a humidity sensor in the room, right by the humidifier, and found that humidity was at an average of 4%. Turning up the density of the mist had no other affect than making the carpet wet.I am looking elsewhere for a product that actually works."
5,so worth it,"we ordered the elephant crane humidifier and at first wasn't sure what to expect but when we tried, we were amazed with how quiet it is and how much moisture we see coming out of the spout. this is our third humidifier and the first one that really worked well for us! I highly recommend it. it is just a little pain to clean the water container. It is also so cute that my daughter loves it."
2,hello kitty humidifer,It worked great at first but the motor now makes a grinding noise and will no longer run. 3 weeks of good use but no more. The nightlight is very good.
1,Not as good as previous model,"I bought a Crane penguin humidifier in 2009 and it worked fine for 1 year before breaking down. I wasn't too upset as this was a lower end model and I had used the humidifier everyday for at least 8 hours.To humidify with my extremely dry apartment, I bought a new crane penguin humidifier. Unfortunately, the new crane penguin was not up to standard! Crane has improved its design, making it easier to clean. However, do note that this new humidifier produces ONLY A FRACTION of the mist (1/5 of mist compared to my 2009 model)! I think this is an attempt to increase the intervals (approximately once every 48 hours) before one needs to refill the humidifier. I actually bought and returned this humidifier twice before giving up and switching to the SPT penguin humidifier (cheaper and works well)."
2,Died after about a month,Had to return it after about a month of on and off use because it stopped producing steam. Other than that we liked it a lot--will probably try again.
2,BREAKS after only a few weeks,"This is a great humidifier... for a few weeks. It does not last. After a month of good function, this humidifier starting making loud noises and stopped working. I have tried to contact the manufacturer several times, but they do not reply. DO NOT BUY this product if you intend on running it all the time. It will NOT last. It is poor quality. It is my third one that I have purchased and I am DONE with it. All three have broken in the exact same way. Save your money and buy something else."
4,wonderful item,"I only gave it 4 stars because our first one was a flop, it barely blew out mist, the light did not work and the water was boiling hot. After an easy exchange with amazon the new one has not had one problem."
1,Worked great for two months,I purchased the Hello Kitty model and as my title states it worked great for two months then quit putting any moisture out at all. I realize that we live in a disposable society but this is just ridiculous! I will NEVER buy a Crane product again. Cute but very poorly made is my opinion.
3,Cute but not practical,"I've been using this one for about a month now and it seems to be as efficient as it is cute. However, it has one rather significant disadvantage - the water container (specifically cow's head) absolutely cannot be cleaned. My attempts to use Clorox in order to get read of organic residue and algae that tend to accumulate on the walls with a frightening speed had gone in vain. The entrance port, on the other hand, is a way too narrow for a hand to reach, and will not allow to use a standard brush neither. It's, indeed, one of the most adorable models on the market, and definitely does a job for the money, but I'm not sure how much one can benefit from a device that while raising the overall humidity on the premises starts shooting mushrooms in the air two days after it was purchased."
1,Noisy leaking humidifier,I have hard time understanding why this item is popular. It's very difficult to fill. It leaks all over. It makes so much noise that you can't keep it on a night stand next to your bad. I've had a replacement but the issues were not resolved. I returned it.
2,"Cute, but not worth the frustration","When I saw this humidifier, I thought it was so adorable. I bought the red dragon design for my son's bedroom. For the first week or so, it worked great! You can see the mist and everything. But then...it started making loud noises. We're not exactly sure why it is so loud. I think it's just an unfortunate feature of ultrasonic humidifiers. They are really touchy and we will never buy another one ever again - of any brand. We tried using distilled water. No dice. We also tried the demineralization filter thing that crane offers, but it still had problems. My husband has to jostle and shake it for about ten minutes every night to get it to run quietly. NOT WORTH THE FRUSTRATION!!!I would have given it only one star, but it's adorable and when it actually works, it works well....but that's only about 30% of the time."
4,Very cute! A lot of steam! But leaks a lot!,"It leaks!! Big time! I'm not gonna stop using it I just put one of my baby's disposable pads underneath it, it does it's job very well regardless of the leaking high quality even in the low setting there's a lot of mist and it also has a lights very very dim that won't disturb nobody's sleep"
5,"Works great, totally adorable","You can adjust how much mist comes out AND you can turn the head to point the mist in a certain direction (the mist comes out of the beak) -- it's better than the frog for this reason.PLUS, it's absolutely adorable!! I am an extremely satisfied customer."
4,Do not place towel under humidifier,"I learned the hard way that placing a towel under the unit can impede airflow and cause the unit to fail. The manual DOES warn against it. If you are concerned about water damage to furniture, just make sure you are setting the output properly. Another alternative might be to place it on one of those thin plastic placemats for children. Other than the sometimes difficult-to-open tank cap, I have no complaints about this product and feel they have been essential in keeping my family comfortable through the Winter."
2,2nd Crane to die early,"My daughter loves Hello Kitty. We live in dry air, Colorado, therefore I like to keep humidifiers in the kids rooms. I have four kids and 4 Cranes. They are adorable - you can't go wrong there. However, the fan on this Hello Kitty is outrageously loud and not functioning properly after only 3 months. This is the second Crane that I have had this problem with. In the past I have just thrown them out and began again. This time I will see if I can get a replacement. If this turns out to be an easy process, I would rate the humidifier higher. Again - it is adorable! If not, I will likely stop buying Cranes. While they are affordable at the outset, they are not when you have to replace them every 3 to 6 months."
5,Great humidifier,"Great humidifier and works very well. We got the penguin one. The ""steam"" comes out nicely and is pretty quiet, even on high. I never noticed the ""on"" light being to bright so that definitely wasn't a problem. It's easy to fill and fits in a bathroom sink to fill up whereas my other one didn't so I had to fill it up in the bathtub. It's easy to clean and take care of. The only thing to remember is to NOT carry it by the handle when it is full of water. My husband accidentally did this and it shattered. We immediately bought another one because we loved it so much."
2,Quiet but did not work well,Cute but... I had it for about a month and it cracked but was still usable. You could not turn it up too high or everything underneath it would get all wet. After about 6 months of use it stopped working. It was also difficult to clean.
1,Crane Humidifiers: Only good for a couple of months!,"Just a note on the Crane humidifiers. I started out with the Hello Kitty one, it stopped working after 3 months. Crane replaced it with a new one. That one stopped working after 1 month. So I figured I'd switch characters and Crane replaced the second one with the Penguin. That worked great for the rest of last winter season (maybe 3 months?). Then I plugged it back in again 2 weeks ago...and it didn't work. From my experience with Crane, I would say they are nice in replacing their faulty humidifiers, but all three of their humidifiers that I've used lasted no longer than 3 months. I would not recommend them. (Sorry if this post sounds a little miffed, I'm tired of sending them cut-off humidifier electrical cords so they can send me yet another faulty humidifier so I'm giving up on them.)"
2,Would love it if it worked all the time but....,I believe the unit came defective. It worked perfect for a short while but then started making a bad revving noise and the mist would not rise thru the chamber. I tried cleaning it extra carefully with vinegar thinking it was due to mineral deposit. It the worked off and on but finally conked out for good just past the 1 year warranty date. I should have called immediately since it was clearly a defective unit. Hello Kitty Model
1,This humidifier will make you go deaf!,"I've gone through two of these humidifiers now and they both ended up with the same problem. The first one I had for about 2 weeks and it worked great, and then all of a sudden the motor started sounding like a car without a muffler. Even my husband who sleeps through everything couldn't sleep with it on. It was extremely loud. It was still under warranty, so I figured I just got a defective one and exchanged it for a new one. The new one I only used for a few nights, and then I didn't need it anymore for a while, so it sat in it's box. 6 months later, I take it out again, and it's suddenly horribly noisy like the old one. Unfortunately, since it laid in the closet for several months, it's warranty is long over, so I'm stuck with an adorable, but completely useless humidifier. The claims of it being ""whisper quiet"" are simply not true."
1,Terrible Crane model,"Terrible model. We have the Crane Cow and LOVE it so decided to buy another Crane. The 1st one arrived quickly but was defective, knob to control mist did not work. Sent back the next day, Amazon immediately sent me a replacement and this one is junk, mist barely comes out even if on high and goes straight down to floor....completely ineffective. My Crane Cow the mist shoots straight up w/ force and makes the room like a rain forest, the dragon model was awful. Returning this one to buy a different model at a local store in case I have to return."
1,"Cute, but it only worked for a month.","We got this about a month ago for our 3 month old. We have run it for a month and it worked well until this week. The fan started running very loud and wakes us all up. (Our baby sleeps in a bassinet in our room.) My husband took it apart to see if he could fix it, but a replacement fan is not available for purchase. We have written the company to see what can be done. In the mean time, it is a big, plastic, expensive piece of junk. I'm so disappointed."
4,Its worth every penny!,"I bought this last week and I must say its worth every penny. After researching for weeks about which humidifier i should purchase it all came down to this one. Surprisingly this one has tons of more positive reviews than those that even 100 dollars plus. Right when you plug it in, it starts steaming instantaneously. I suffer for eczema and during the winter months i used to wake up to dry cracked skin. Every night before bed i would have to put hydrocortisone where my skin irritated most. Now with this humidifier I don't have to do anything. I read reviews saying this would just last up to 6 hours but i was stunned when mine lasted for 4 days on half speed with juts one fill. It is a pain to refill but it does get the job done. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a humidifier."
2,broken and never replaced,"the plastic water Reservoir was broken, so I returned it and it was never replaced"
1,Straight to the trash can,"This is a great product. At first it didn't seem to work but the problem resolved itself once I found the right surface. I bought a second one in the shape of a pig, and both humidifiers work very well.These products are quite powerful for their price. You need to make sure that there is enough breathing space under the bottom of the unit, otherwise it won't be able to function."
1,This is not a Humidifier!,"I used this product for about 10 days. I have two different hygrometers whose reads typically differ by a 1%. Both of them didn't register any (any!) variation in the humidity of my (small) bedroom after hours and hours of operation with the door closed! They do register important variations when the shower is on or something is boiling in the on the other side of the house. This is a nebulizer, not a humidifier. The water goes on the floor as soon as it is ejected. Absolutely useless. I am so going to return this item."
2,Messy,"Be prepared to put down a towel or two in the mist path as this will make your hardwoods nice and slick or your carpets cold and wet. If used at lower intensity it is less messy, but then again, less humidity for those little noses."
1,The fire department just left.,"I purchased a Hello Kitty humidifier for my daughter on October 28th. It's been run and well-maintained in a the few weeks we've had it. Unfortunately, tonight the motor caught on fire. Thankfully, the smoke alarms alerted us and the fire department before a tragedy happened - my seven year old was asleep in the room. I will be alerting the manufacturer and amazon of the safety concerns, but in the meantime, you might want to skip this purchase until it's deemed safe. I will not forget the haze in my daughter's room when the door was opened tonight for a long time.The fire department confirmed that the problem was with the humidifier, although it was being used correctly. Hopefully this was an isolated incident, but please be wary of this product."
3,"Works ok, but messy","I bought this for my child when he is having bad allergies. Before buying this, I've been using the Air-O-Swiss which I was very satisfied with. According to Consumer Reports, the Crane humidifiers are better than the Air-O-Swiss, so I decided to give it a try. I was sorta disappointed. It's really cute. It's simple to use. Just one knob. But my problem with is when you try to lift up the head to refill, water spills everywhere. This doesn't happen with my Air-O-Swiss. I know it's not a defective product, but rather a design flaw. Overall, if you're looking for something cheap and fool-proof to use, this is it for you. But if you're looking for something nicer and sturdier, buy an Air-O-Swiss. I would've liked this product more if it comes with a humidity-gauge, which the Air-O-Swiss had."
1,Poor Product,"First one did not turn on at all. Second one was extremely loud. Going for refund, not a replacement - again."
2,Cracked item and weak mist,I just received the Crane Cow Humidifier yesterday and already there was a big CRACK on the right side. I tested it by filling the tank with water to see if it still work. I told myself returning it would be too troublesome if it works. After 10-15 minutes the mist didn't come out of the top. I opened it and saw really weak mist stationing inside. The setting was on MAX too. I dropped it off at the Post Office today and placed an order for the PIG. Let hope it doesn't come damaged and actually works!!! >(
3,Works find but power indicator light too faint,"When I look into the little hole where the light is supposed to be it's just dark, but when I look down at the unit (placed on my kitchen counter) I can sort of the see the light near/through the little hole, very faint. I suspect the light was not accurately placed when assembled. Otherwise the unit works fine. So I'll not go through the hassle of the returning and trying another one."
4,birthday gift,I got this for my 4 year old because she wanted to play with her daddy. the guns are fine but the belt was huge still she has funn using ti for dress up it was a good buy.
3,"Whatever Happened to ""Just Press Play "" ?","This would be a 5 star release if it weren't for the maddening and terribly frustrating navigation. Instead of a straight forward menu there are cutesy icons pointing the way to various ""rooms"" which again are full of more icons and hidden extras. You just never know what you're gonna get, until you watch it enough to commit the icons to memory. And, really, who has time for all that ?? Pop music and pop music videos should be fun to listen to and watch, and this is just far too much work."
1,Censored DVD,"I would give this five stars; but the songs on the DVD are the ""clean"" versions... It's great to see the videos; but the censorship ruins the whole experience. I would like to give it zero stars; but I will settle for one."
5,Very cool DVD,"Everything worked great on this DVD. The only problem I had was after viewing the pictures on Murdoc's laptop, my computer froze, but I'm almost certain that was a problem on my end. I loved all the great music videos and animations, and there's lots to explore on this interactive DVD. Recommended for all Gorillaz fans."
5,"Norstrilia, a must read neglected classic","This book has been published several times yet it's always difficult to find. The world created by Smith is fascinating and compelling on every level. Animals fighting for their own rights, benevolent (we hope) dictators pulling everyone's strings, and a young man who corners the market on the most valuable commodity in the galaxy - by accident.If you only read new science fiction I would really recommend that you broaden your horizons by trying this oldie."
5,Good product,"Nice tape, good price, most of these are much more expensive when they include metric. It's a good size and easy to use, very happy with this product."
5,Best value for the price,"I ordered three of these.I constantly have contractors working on my place. Invariably, someone swipes my tape measures.I need a low cost alternative to the expensive Stanley's I had been purchasing. This unit measures up for one third the price.The housing is Ballistic plastic (like a safety helmet) and wears well with scratching, dropping, etc. The plastic housing tends to protect the spring mechanism if the unit is dropped.The scale is easy to read and marked off in centimteres and inches. The blade is nylon coated, and, a flat yellow finish (which makes it easy to read in direct sunlight). The tongue is stainless steel, as is the clip on the side. The steel is in place for maximum wear protection on the most used parts (the tongue and clip). The color makes it easy to spot when I am looking for it in my pile of tools.This is one of the best buys one can make on a quality tape measure that is price-effective."
1,alternator,you cannot get any warranty on this alt.if it is any more than 30 days old.when other stores offer a lifetime warranty on same product.mine failed in 6mo.
2,Navigaion - aaggghh.,"This book is fine,to read and recline,but navigateand you will be latefor to find a poem in kindis a pain in the behind.But because it is freeit's quite a catch you see."
2,"Good light quality, slow warmup","This would be a great product if it didn't take ten minutes or so to warm up and put out full light. The quality of the light is excellent, but waiting in near-darkness until it warms up is highly annoying.No matter what our government says, compact fluorescent bulbs are not ready for prime time and probably never will be. They rarely outlast a much cheaper incandescent bulb, contain toxic materials, are too big for many fixtures and have numerous problems besides the warm up issue.Another example of our stupid intrusive ""special interest"" government. I'm glad I purchased about 50 incandescent bulbs before the ban. Buy the time these are gone, LED bulbs will likely be practical and affordable."
1,Broken Camera,"The Casio Exilim I received was broken upon delivery. I was unable to take a single picture and as I had purchased it to take on a cruise and paid extra to have it mailed in two days, it was a complete disaster.To add to the difficulty, when we called the company to return it, they said there would be a 20% restocking fee.Needless to say, as a person who purchases many items from Amazon, I was terribly disappointed in the purchase and the poor customer service by Expo Electronics. a company that Amazon utilizes as a vendor."
1,Casio rip-off,"My $200 camera went bad from a VERY COMMONLY reported manufacturing defect ""camera stabilizer is not available"" error message in the model I had. Since this is a common defect from the manufacture, they should have fixed my camera at their expense, but they refused to fix it without me having to pay $100 something for their manufacturing defect plus shipping charges! Don't buy Casio products! They don't stand behind the quality of their products."
1,Terrible camera,"2 cameras in 3 months. A stabilizer error appeared in both instances. Now, it looks as if I can't get my money back and I'm stuck with an unreliable camera. If you like calling 800 numbers to check the status of your repair, this is the camera for you."
1,Horrible camera,"I bought this 6 weeks ago from bestbuy for 300. I am having the same problem as many other are having. It worked ok for 4 weeks. After that it started saying ""camera stabilizer not available"".Having said that, when it worked image quality was ok but video quality was horrible. May be I need to change some settings but out of the box video is horrible.I have used other casio cameras which were pretty good but this is one poor camera."
1,BORING!!!,"This book was ssssssssooooooooooooooooo boring! all it did was drag on and on about nothing that was important. In most books there is and interesting twist that makes you want to keep reading, but not this book! DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!!! IT WAS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!"
1,Obscene,"While the cover of this book claims its content varies from ""the delightfully droll to the truly tasteless,"" almost all of the jokes fall into the latter category. I don't mind a dirty joke or two, but I was heartily disgusted after flipping through this book for five minutes.Unless you are looking for obscene/offensive humor, spare yourself the indignation and choose another joke book."
1,"pretentious, predictable, and a total letdown!","I bought this book because of all the rave comments.....shortly into it, I was already having regrets....These characters don't ring real to me, there is no real depth to them, and they all do exactly what you expect them to....everything seems so choreographed....and then towards the end, it just gets way over the top.....I actually threw the book in the air and went to bed I was so irritated. I will not be paying money for future books by this author...."
3,A Midwest Horse Whisperer Story,I can still recall the horror and surprise I felt in the middle crisis of this story. I reread it several times to make sure I had not made a mistake. From that point on the story became more trite though it did have a mystical aspect to it. I felt that the author left the reader dangling in the end with a lot of gaps and holes in the plot. Still it was an interesting read but I wouldn't buy the book- get it at the library. It reminded me quite a bit of The Horse Whisperer but it wasn't of the same caliber.
1,Misguid book that only makes Christianity look like a cult..,"While there are merits to this book, this author unfortunately goes too far in his theology, giving us a pretty impossible form of Christianity. I've studied the ""Death to self"" doctrine and the related biblical phrases, and there are significant problems with it, which I will not go into detail here(I will say that the biblical phrases that inspired this doctrine have a lot more to do with Persecution and Martyrdom than discipleship). The form of Christianity Bonhoeffer suggests however has inspired other 'cult' leaders who have told followers to 'cut themself off' from the world and their families to 'follow' Christ. If one studies Dietrich's life story, however, he himself was a hypocrite in this regard, as he was quite involved in worldly politics and close to his family.One is safer reading the historical and theological contexts of the bible--such as an unbiased commentary-before following the words of someone else."
5,Someone Who Practiced What He Preached,"""What does it mean to be a Christian?"" For too many evangelicals, this question is answered with a statement on a profession of faith, and the sentence ends there. However, 20th century German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer argued that Christianity required someone to heed Jesus' words, ""Follow Me."" Bonhoeffer defined these answers as Cheap Grace and True Grace, respectively. He has done an amazing job of outlining the case that Christians must take their faith more seriously by becoming true disciples of Jesus, rather than pervert the message by treating it as no cost fire insurance, and his example (dying because of his efforts to fight the Nazi regime) is a shining example for all of what it means to take one's faith seriously."
1,impossible to retain,"I found this book very hard to retain in audio form. He reads quickly, fires off a gazillion lists and bores, to be frank. I was so disappointed having loved his more off-the-cuff lectures to live audiences. This deadened the mind and left me with nada..."
4,Truman Capote's wonderful Story,"A Christmas Memory by Truman Capote is the most moving and truly sincere book I have ever read. The sincere love Buddy showed toward Sook was entirely inspirational and unique in all aspects. During the time that Buddy was at military school, Sook showed her devotion to him by sending him letters (with a dime for a picture show) and fruitcakes. Buddy was growing up but he still loved Sook and refused to revoke his love for her. When the horrorindious news arrived one day, something in Buddy had already told him it was so. Buddy looked toward the sky, as he expected ""rather like hearts a lost pair of kites hurrying toward heaven. A Christmas Memory may be just a story, but once you enter the pages of the book the lives of these people come to life and entwine with your own."
5,Dan in Mass.,"I searched all year for a DVD of A Christmas Memory that was of good quality; unfortunately, none seem to exist at the moment. I decided to give my daughter the book, instead. As great as the original broadcast was (I remember it from my childhood), the book as a Christmas gift was so much better. My only regret was that the illustrated treatment of this book, makes it appear to be a book for a very young child. The wonderful, colorful prose of Truman Capote could have stood on their own, without the illustrations. Nonetheless, a terrific book to give as either a Thanksgiving or Christmas present."
1,Even if it was not a good quality,I just want the company to know even if the quality was not good. Amazon was quick to refund the money satifying the customer which is a good thing. I am very happy to buy from Amazon and will continue to purchase from them. They are customer people and whenever there is a problem they clear it up quickly. Thank you very much Amazon.
2,Body Ball,"These seem to be very good quality, sturdy enough for heavier people. A good size. Very easy to use."
4,Strange & good,"Not being an expert, this seems to be a good collection with very able liner notes & reasonable accoustic quality. If you're not into the all too harmonious and sweet and prefer the rather harsh and eccentric sides of country & folk, this will be for you."
4,Excellent book if you're committed to PL/SQL,This book is excellent and the author's proficiency in Oracle/XML is second to none. I like his News Portal and Pager explanations. This is the first book I've seen to talks about the issues when paginating result sets using XML or otherwise. I particularly like his approach to using XML as the model and clearly separating the presentation from the model. He preaches this throughout the book and demonstrates how to do this effectively using XML and XSLT. The one critisim for me as someone who isn't 100% committed to using Oracle is that he makes a lot of use of PL/SQL and Oracle features. I accept this because it's after all a book about writing Oracle XML applications but it takes away from the reusability of his examples for me.
3,"Ball fun, but popped easily.","The Valeo Ball was fun for my kids for exactly 18 hours, when it popped suddenly while a child (110 lbs) was sitting on it. For the price paid, I expected a more robust product."
4,Valeo Body Ball reccomendation,My purchase of the Valeo Body Ball turned out very well. The 65cm is just the right size for me and I use it every day with the recommendation from my physical therapist. It is great for lossening your lower back and fanny muscles and good for strengthening the back. There were a lot of similar products online but I used to own this brand before so went back to an old favorite. Hope this review helps someone else.
5,Great purchase,"I bought this to use as an office chair, and it is working out great. I had ordered a different ball that was smaller than advertised and took forever to blow up b/c it only came with a small hand pump. This one comes with a foot pump that is much more effective. I inflated it with no problem and am loving it. For anyone interested in replacing their office chair with a balance ball, I recommend this one. I am 5'8"" and for my height most people recommend a 65cm ball, but I find the 75cm ball much more comfortable. If you are tall and have long legs, I would recommend purchasing the 75cm ball."
4,order this if you are short,"only order this if you are less than 5'3"" which i am - it is actually a bit too small for me altho i can use it ok for my purposes - my grandson inflated it easily with the foot pump sent with the ball - good strength and texture"
2,Didn't work for me....,"This is the second or third one of these that I have purchased. I have issues with my sciatic nerve and I can sit on this ball and watch tv and it doesn't set off the nerve. My problem is that it doesn't hold the air and it's hard to fill correctly. Maybe we're doing it wrong, I don't know. Otherwise, when it's blown up, it's great."
4,A pretty good ball,"Well, its a sphere, inflatable, kind of bounces but not so much, comfortable to sit on. The pump could be better though."
2,This ball reeks!,"Functionally speaking, the ball works like it's supposed to, as does the foot pump it comes with. But it came out of the package covered in a film of greasy residue, and even after wiping it down with lysol wipes and letting it air out overnight, it still REEKS. It smells like a mixture of car tires and plastic cups melting in the fire. The fumes are making me sick. I hope the smell goes away... but I have bought other yoga balls and did not have this problem."
2,ball developed hole after 1.5 months,"This ball randomly sprung a leak after only 1.5 months of use. I was initially relatively happy with the purchase, given the price and positive reviews. However, after my experience, I would not recommend it.Furthermore, the really cheap pump that comes with the ball cracked during the first pump, and I had to use duct tape to hold it together to finish inflating the ball.I would not recommend this as a quality buy."
5,Good and sturdy,I work with this almost everyday. It is well made and is large enough for a tall man (6'2).
2,Low Quality and Pump is a Joke.,"This ball took me 5 minutes to inflate using an ELECTRIC pump. You could never inflate it with the pump provided. In addition, the ball is ""sticky"" compared to other balls I have used in the gym I frequent. I bought this because the price was low. If I were you, I would pay more for a better ball."
5,exercise ball,I bought this to stretch the muscles in my back. It seems to be doing the trick. I have problems with tight back muscles.
1,cheap disappointment,"i thought this ball was a great deal with so many great reviews on it but i was really disappointed when i received it. you really get what you paid for. i got a different type of pump than the instructions called for and it was missing a plug, so we couldn't even keep the ball inflated after we went through all the trouble of blowing air in it. it's made of cheap materials and after i started reading the 1 star reviews of it popping during usage, i decided to return it. i can't risk that since i'm pregnant! amazon is a great place to buy stuff because you can see all the reviews - i'm just so surprised this has an overall 4 star rating! don't get it! spend an extra $5 or so for a better one. amazon was great for returns and refunds though."
3,As much about Barfield as about Lewis,"Owen Barfield is probably my favorite unknown author. Everyone who has an interest in philosophy or religion ought to read his masterpiece,Saving the Appearances. This book on Lewis doesn't belong in that category, though I recommend it nonetheless because of Barfield's graceful way with words and the occasional interesting anecdote concerning Lewis. You will learn something of Barfield's own philosophy, but less than a reading of his masterpiece will teach you. So: a qualified recommendation. If you really want to deepen your knowledge of Lewis, read his correspondance."
5,Fantastic show,I am truly waiting for the remaining seasons. Everwood is a fantastic show and one of the few that you can sit down with the entire family and share in lessons without the violence and profanities now viewed as normal. I hope they release the remaining seasons.
5,"Please release the rest of ""Everwood""","I just finished watching all of season one on DVD. I have rarely seen a TV show that captured my heart and mind the way ""Everwood"" does. I don't watch much TV, because I get so tired of the lame plots and scripts. This show was really different, and I would purchase every season on DVD, if I could. Please, if you liked the show, and are here because you want to buy the rest, add your comments. Perhaps we can persuade the folks at WB to release it after all."
5,I LOVE THIS SHOW,"I loved this show and I want all the seasons filmed available for purchase on DVD and NOW!!! Lots of inferior shows have been released but this one, one of the best ever on television has not been released which is unbelievable! Get with it guys and release all the seasons that were filmed, okay?"
5,Been watching TV since the 60's. One of my fave 3 series ever.,"Ok, the other two are Star Trek the Next Generation (not season 1) and Sherlock Holmes with Jeremy Brett. Man, each week this show came on our family was set to enjoy it. Truely, an excellent combination of story line, lead actor (check him out as the substitute teacher/military expert in his movie, he's great in it) and each supporting actor just fits perfectly. Both young men, the lead guy's relatives and his main love interest, the young ladies, everyone just nails it. Excellent dialogue, great Colorado setting, strong story lines, consistent humor. I mean, I can't think of a weakness. Only weakness was they ended the series. It was sweet that they wrapped up the story lines for us in the final season. What can ya do? God bless."
2,Crappy magic light,I really wanted a shadow lantern similar to the one in the movie Sleepy Hollow. Instead this was all I could find. The price is right but that's about all to recommend it. First it's an energy hog. I went through two sets of batteries in 48 hours. The lamp was not bright either. So I tried wiring it to a power supply but the lamps keep burning out. The poor quality reflector and dome distort the images. I'll use this as a stopgap measure until I can find a more suitable lantern from the movie.
1,not worth it,"i thought that this toy would create a beautiful atmosphere for Halloween in a dark room but it's too dim, you can hardly see the figures ..not worth it"
4,nice watch,I am very happy with this watch and it looks great the only promblem i found was that the links keep on poping open
4,An Excellent Historical Reference,"I was very impressed with the information provided in this book. One of the nice aspects of reading a piece such as this is the fact that as it was written in 1848,it was only around 64 or so years (1 full generation only) since the Revolution. Considering this fact, the information provided is pretty closely knit to the time frame of those men actually involved; thus the reader receives a sense of both a writing style and substantive endeavor of an author living in the era.The author isn't afraid of utilizing the current ""politically incorrect"" comparative label of just who led a ""Christian"" life, and each ""signer"" is placed in a light where his works are clearly presented; some of which might just surprise you.I would recommend this work to anyone seeking an excellent historical reference of The American Forefathers who sacrificed both their very lives and well being so we could have the blessings we enjoy in America today."
5,Excellent historical document,Each signer of the Declaration was brought to life due to the writing skills (and research) of the writer. It's well done and reflects the mores of the day and time.
5,This book was great for a Civics project on the signers,"This book is educational and helpful to all Civics students that are working on this area. It gives an in depth view of the past, and educational look at the present and a great view of the Declaration of Independance that we so love in our country."
3,A fun project BUT needs help!,This engine is quite realistic and fun to build. Take your time and make sure that all excess plastic is removed before glueing anything together. Also do not use the metric screws that come with the kit. Use the ORGINAL 2-56 screws that came with the kit back when it was made in the USA. The metric ones are too big and will cause the parts to have to be modified before they will fit together corectlly. The other flaw are the pushrods. they are to weak and need to be replaced with metal ones. Welding rods make good ones. This is because the camshaft journals are not supported as in a real engine block. It is great fun for and adult to do with a kid or in my case grandchild.
2,Plastic Nightmare,"I am a very patient guy and this model kit has destroyed it all. Do mind, that is a given when using glue that there will be some kind of mess. Regardless, the way the manufacturer created all the parts I expected little to no REDESIGNING of parts. I quit building this 3/4 of the way once I realized I will never get the pushrods to actually function with the valves. The plastic camshaft bends the pushrods instead of pushing it up. The pushrods do not even contact the valve lifters.On the brightside, this monumental project does look good after u get the cylinders in and watch the motion of components.I will not recommend this to any of my peers for it is a doomed project from the start. Plastic components are just not made accurately nor precisely and will never fit together unless you make a living re-engineering a catastrophe."
2,Disappointed in so many little ways,"I bought this expecting it would be like the old Revell model I knew as a kid...Alas, it is a poor copy. No motor, no lights, lame instructions and cheaply molded.I should have read the reviews first. Teach me."
4,Non-Electrical Visable V-*,"I remember building a Visable V-8 as a youngster. I was motorized so that as the pistons reached the top, a red light would go on as if it actually ignited the fuel. Wish the description clearly stated it is a hand crank model."
5,The greatest of these....,"I read this book at least once a year to keep me focused on what's important in my life. Love is the greatest, most important force in our universe. This book explains the essense of love and provides profound insights on it purpose and how we may employ it in our daily lives. Read it, learn it, and do it. Your life will be fulfilled!"
4,Great compilation,This is a beautiful thing. I just picked this up still in the wrapper at a local discount book/music store here in Ohio for $7.98. Seeing the price on here it makes it oh so sweet. Great tunes. I think I like the first CD out of the three the best though.
1,This toy is an extreme dissapointment,"(...)my best friend and i split the cost and bought this toy with our christmas. We had spent hours in front of hasbro.com lokking at the features of it. We thought it would be great. We could talk wenever we wanted. Wen we finally got them we opened them with anticipation. What a disapointment! the pictures are blurry it dosenot work if you are over a mile apart, it is way bigger then an acual cell phone. IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK. THE TOY IS A PIECE OF JUNK DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. My friend and i let my mom sell them on ebay. peoplle acual biddid on them. we got payed 200 dollars (of course we split it) now i have an acual camera flip cell phone. And with the lef over money we bought a paif of really good walkie talkies with a 50 mile range. Please take my advice. DONT BUY THIS TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Awaken your Sixth Sense!,"An interesting little tome on the art of learning psychic abilities - most fascinating to me was the chapter on crystal gazing, which I always found a little hokey (maybe I've just seen too many gypsies doing it on bad Hollywood movies), but the science behind it is really quite interesting. A fun little book to have and to read."
1,Some one should get Huang a tutor,"The worst part about this book is not that the text is unclear. It's not that Huang glosses over important topics. It's not even the uncreative problems at the end of each chapter. THE TEXT IS RIDDLED WITH ERRORS. Did Huang proof read this or does he just not know physics well? Who ever hear of approximating n ! by n ln n - 1 for large n? Apparently, Huang did. He wrote a whole chapter about it, and derived several results from the erroneous statement. Typos are acceptable, but systematic errors should not be present in a teaching text."
1,Dull,"For some reason my last review is being touted as a ""kid's review"" which I find rather unfortunate since I just have to write the review again. I also feel sad saying that I wrote the last ""kid's review"" since I imagine many educators being pleasantly surprised to see a 12-year with any articulation.Anyhow, this movie takes a great historical movement and reduces it to a badly executed story about a guy who couldn't keep his wife from getting kidnapped. There's also the best friend who betrays him and the mother who keeps giving him grief. The music is terrible. Everything feels like it was made in the 1970s. The action sequences are glossed over. The human emotional scenes are melodrama.Terrible movie. Avoid."
1,Terrible...,"Quote from the movie:(GK):""- I will go as far as I can; with every land I conquer, more borders between nations will vanish. People will travel freely and trade will flourish. Cultures and customs will be honored and all live well""Some woman soldier that he respected and hardly went to bed with her - believable considering the fact that 11% of the Mongols share his genes - he must have sworn an oath of chastity - other ""historic truth"":""- But make war and there will be more bloodshed...""(GK):""- That is bloodshed that cannot be helped to ensure that no future blood need be spilled.""Come on, just a bit more and they would have turned him in Dalai Lama... Too bad they had no ocean handy, otherwise they would have made him join ""Green Peace"" in ""Save the Whales"" program (not that is something wrong with that)..."
3,Better Than a Documentary - Not an Oscar Contender,"I wanted to see this film because I like history and I didn't know much about the life of Genghis Khan. From what I can tell this film puts a lot of the right events in the right places but perhaps idealizes the hero too much. The film also suffers from being a foreign film with English subtitles, or else foreign film with dubbed English dialogue, depending on the setting you use when watching. The subtitles and/or Elglish dubbing drains some of the passion from the film and makes it stretch a little long in a couple of areas. Other spots so rivit the viewer's attention that the dubbing and/or subtitles are barely noticable. I would never give this film a five, but had it been originaly filmed in English I might have given it a four."
2,Inauthentic depiction looks Japanese,"Viewers in the west may not readily recognize the subtle inauthenticity of this opus. The production is Japanese, and it looks, well.. Japanese, with an unwarranted kinship to samurai epics. There's a lot of flags and swordplay that stylistically don't fit the subject matter. A much more authentic production is MONGOL on the same subject. But neither go very far in the career of Genghis Khan. Here he comes off as a sensitive, considerate kind of guy. You don't see any of the mass slaughter as he and his hordes moved west. Mostly what you have is the early Genghis, as he's starting out, his travails, up to the point where he begins his conquests. So if you're looking for how he amassed the largest land empire on the earth you won't find it here. The subtitle is ""To the Ends of the Earth & Sea,"" but in this production he doesn't get very far."
3,It's a film,I look at this film as a historical film that tells us the story of how Genghis Khan came to be the historical figure that he is. What I really liked about the movie was the cinematography. Definitely a well done visual epic tale. I did learn which is always good for me. The constant struggle for self acceptance by the main character made the film more enjoyable. I would not buy the film. If I were doing research on Genghis Khan and wanted to visually get an idea of what it may have been like to be in Mongolia in the 1200's then this would be an ok film to rent.

5,TODAY'S SPECEL A GREAT CHILDREN SHOW FOR KIDES,I LOVED THIS SHOW WHEN I WAS A KID IN THE 80'S. THIS SHOW IS HARETWARMING THE WAY JEFF COMES TO LIFE AND PLAY'S. I LOVE WHEN MY LITLE COUSAN WACHES IT I CAN WATCH TO IT BRINGS ME BACK TO WHEN I WAS A KID AND HOW I FELT TO WATCH SUCH A WONDERFULL SHOW. I AM SO GLAD I GOT THE INTENET OR MIT NOT HAVE EVER HAVE FOUND THE VIDEO AGAIN SO I COULD SHOW IT TO TODAYS GENERATION. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS VIDEO BE SURE TO GET IT FOR YOUR KIDS. THANK YOU
2,not practical,"I got chatnow for christmas and and loved it and all the cool features until I tried to communicate with a friend I coulld not recieve ""any"" signal and it is ok for communicating on the same property but to communicate with a friend that lives some where else you practicly have to be some where with no trees or anything in the path of the signal-the phone over all is cool but its communicating skills don't work for me."
3,I don't know what to do!!!!,"I got two chatnows for Christmas last year and we have never been able to get the call or the text message to work. My brother and I really want to call each other and text message each other, but it won't work. We don't know if we are doing it wrong or if we just got bad chatnows. If anybody has an answer to our problem, please write a review answering my question as soon as you can. Thanks!!"
1,A Bad buy,Do not buy this product which is both antiquated and incapable of working on Windows 7.I was trying to update an earlier version of this product and discovered that my older version worked while this did not.
3,Good Teenager product,"I bought this perfume for my niece. She loved it. Of couse, perfume taste is very subject. I am sure teenagers will love it."
2,DVD automatically displays English subtitles. (Frustrating!),"My DVD automatically displays English subtitles as the default setting. This happens every time we play it. I got it for my niece who's 4, and she always has to ask someone to reset it to display no subtitles. ( She otherwise can just hit the play button to start a DVD.) I was NOT happy with that. This info should have been stated on this website. I would never have bought it if I knew this. Poorly made cartoon, although my niece still watches it because she likes Stuart."
5,An excellent and creepy book,"A young, teenage couple leave their hometown for a weekend and when they return, eveyone is gone and there is no trace of life elsewhere on the earth. (They find this out by calling people on the phone.) They soon discover three other poeple in the town and its a mystery how these 5 came to be the only ones in exstence. This is an good book with chilling parts."
2,Bo just kept re-writing the same songs!?!,"I was so dissapointed with this set. What shocked me was that Bo just kept writing the same songs over and over (and over...) again, and again, and again. Sad that he needed to do that. The CD does have his great stuff on it, and nice to have those, but SO MUCH is just sadly poor revisions of his own old hits, with new words, or whatever. Cannot just put the CD on and sit back; need to skip around. Oh, and seems they are all out of chronological order? Poor editing."
5,Bo rules!,Great great collection. Bo wrote some classic blues and rock tunes. And no slouch as a guitar player. And these tracks got great sound too. A+
1,Don't waste your time,"This movie was a waste of my time. I bought this movie since it had a cast of actors I like, but I wish I had read the reviews first. I watched it twice since I fell asleep when it was on the first time. The plot was boring and the acting was terrible. I love romantic comedies, but this movie was not funny or romantic. I didn't laugh once. In fact, I found myself rolling my eyes at how stupid the movie was. I would rather watch a made-for-tv movie on Lifetime or the Hallmark Channel any day. I wish I had never seen this movie."
4,Blonde expectations,"Let's not discriminate. Whether you hate or you like Jessica Simpson, the movie was all in all fairly cute.It's a chick flick, a light romantic comedy, an ideal rental (although I wouldn't have wanted to watch this movie at the theatre). Fairly unreal, over the edge, exaggeration... but fun to watch.Predictable, but aren't all movies such as this?When we watch this kind of movie we cannot expect oscar-winning acting and complicated story lines, we should just take it as is... Blonde Ambition."
1,really bad....,"I'm so disappointed with this album...don't know where to start.Sounds like the band have totally lost it and have had a lack of songwriting talent where this album is concerned.""I'm so excited"" is possibly the worst cover version I've heard and I just don't understand why a band who have been so vocal, political and exciting at times have come up with such a bad album and to make it worse on a MAJOR label."
4,Damn!,"I had heard of this band a while ago, but I didn't want to spend money on yet another flavor of the month. However, this disk was so awesome! It was clever and smart, but it made me want to get up strut, swagger, and dance!"
2,"yes, you can dance to this if you have no rhythm",All I can say is that I'll be sending this back. Why do Le Tigre have to always be so preachy for the sake of it? They should have concentrated on making a great album instead of trying to be like some politico figureheads. If I want to hear the great Susan Sarandon making an anti war speech then I would rather listen to it without Le Tigre's insipid weak beats in the background. Very poor.
2,Unfocused,"Le Tigre have let me down. A couple of good songs and then wham, just rehashed ""Oh bondage up yours"" crap mixed with B-52s ish fodder. >2.5 Yawns."
3,2nd. edition needed.,"I like the basic organization of this book.Many useful photos and easy to understand trail maps.(But do not reply on them while hiking.)I use this book to get an idea for my next hiking destination.However the 2nd edition is needed to correct some easyto spot errors. Fo example, ten photos are described with wrong mountain names."
4,It would take an idiot not to understand these maps.,"Almost didn't get this book because of the reviews I seen saying that the maps were hard to understand. After looking at the preview pages I decided to risk it anyway and I am glad I did. It would really take an idiot to not understand what the maps are doing. They are set up so that you are looking at the trail in 3D from the trailhead, not in a North, South top down orientation. They make great sense when you are standing there with the trail live and in front of you and it does not take much of a stretch of the imagination to figure it out without being there. My one bit of advice, if you can't figure out the maps in this book, you should reconsider going into the wilderness, because you are not ready for it. And in my opinion, you don't take the book with you, you take a map. The book is just for helping you figure out were it is that you want to go."
3,A likeness to 'marriage'?,"I came to this work from Boswell's famous 'Christianity, Social Tolerance and Homosexuality', and found it quite a different sort of book - less panoramic in scope, less assertive, and somehow lacking the zealous excitement of the former work. Maybe that is just an indication of the impact 'CSTH' has had on our understanding of gay history. I would advise the general reader to read CSTH first, and - if you only read one book by Boswell - for CSTH to be it. 'Marriage of Likeness' is probably one for the more specialist library. Having said that, I found 'Marriage of Likeness' fascinating - and very relevant to the current debates of 'gay marriage' - in the way it focusses on identifying the real nature of heterosexual marriage, in order to open the way to a recognition of the true significance of same-sex unions. Finally, if you are planning a 'union' ceremony, 'Marriage of Likeness' contains an extensive selection of historic texts, with plenty of words that still resonate."
2,Disappointed with Hanes women's ankle socks,I was disappointed with Hanes womens ankle socks which I expected to be much thicker and durable. One of the threads snagged and came undone after only one wear and the socks do not appear to be holding their shape after one washing.
3,da king is slippin,"mayne c'mon t.i. u can do better than this mayne but fo'real though overall this album wasnt hot it was str8...if u dont have them go out and buy ""trap muzik"" and ""urban legend"" cuz they sho enuff wuz betta than this cd by a landslide"
4,King,"This album, in my opinion, is more for the masses. Not saying he didn't keep it through - its more so about production. Can you blame any artist for creating a piece that will appeal to more CONSUMERS. Dude knows how to make an album. I think that it is safe and daring all at the same time. He has some sure winners on there and the rest you'll warm up to. I would have gave it a 5 if he said his name - know what i'm talkin' bout."
2,has its moments,"Too violent, too hokey, too predictable, too shallow.The violence is the part of that that's a surprise: The characters suffer crippling injuries, near deaths, and ruinous destructions of property time after time after time. On the plus side, the director knows how to make explosions big."
4,i love my barbells..,I give 4 stars because the shipping took 2 much time..i ordened them last friday and i recived them today thursday...I bought them because the normal size is too short for my tongue..i bought 4..And i love them..u can screw both balls...i was wondering if they were that way..and yeah..they are !:D <3
1,Pull string is of very poor quality. (New Product from Amazon.),"I would never order this product again. When you pull the chain and let go it's supposed to stop the water from running automatically, it doesn't. I can't tell you how much my water bill went up before I caught this leak. This product is definitely defective and should be worked on due to the leaking after the chain is released. I should be due a refund for this product for my $60.00 water bill but instead I'm letting the public know this if not worth the money. Dave G."
1,Bad a out of the box,"Received this valve today and installed it. When I turned the water on had a leak, this was not a drip but a inch stream. Moved handle a few times to see if there was some thing in the valve. Well go to the store, try to repair with a new/better seal. Would not buy this product again."
5,"I want this, but....","I have been waiting for years to finish off my Cell Games collection, because my son is into it now and we watch Dragonball Z together. But what kind of glue are you people sniffing to think that anyone is going to pay 70 bucks for a DVD that isn't worth anything more than $14 tops? Would you please come to your senses and lower the price already? I need Sacrifice and this DVD, but hell will freeze over before I invest 70 bucks in this, considering the box set will probably be out next year and I can get the entire Cell Games saga for $30. These last few episodes are excellent, but hold off on buying it here."
5,Inventive lyrics and charming person,"I had the pleasure of attending a concert of hers last night. I do not speak Spanish, so I was rather grateful that she explained the genesis of each song before perfoming it. If she were in the business of writing generic love songs, one could be spared the lecture, but no--this is a person who can find something to say about the age of six (not merely five or seven), a flower's life, and other generally uplifting themes. I speculate that had Kate Bush been born in a warmer climate, she might have written songs like this!After the concert I bought this CD, had it signed by the whole band, then listened to it when I got home. The quality of the recording satisfied me, though I only listened to it on a laptop. The cover proudly claims that the latest 24 bit-96KHz recording technology was used, if it is of any consolation. The only thing I missed was her charming theatrics."
4,seemed to work,Seemed to work. My wife had a weird skin rash and the Doc. tried all sorts of remedies which did not work. Finally a friend said try this stuff.
5,Something to look up to,I was only ten years old when this series came out and I've loved it ever since. It was a trend setter for many urban shows and a goal to reach for many others. I've been waiting and waiting for the seasons to come out. Can we please set a better example for our youth? I believe A Different World is a prime example of what our youth should stive to become.
1,Boo,"In theory it is a great product. Unfortunately when I received it, there was a crack on the top of the item that was very noticeable. Amazon sent me another and the second was in worse shape - two cracks even more noticeable. Amazon says they will be issuing a full refund, but three weeks have passed and I'm still waiting. It has been an annoying experience."
2,Dry - and I'm not talking lane conditions,"I agree with one of the reviews that I read here about this book. BORING. Unless you are a robot, do not buy this book. I like lots of detail on the mechanics and science behind the game with illustrations. The book accomplishes this on some fronts by showing the 3021 technique and some other useful tips, but it fails in not showing others. It does not delve enough into the hook release and shooting at strikes + lane conditions.This book does have a lot of illustrations and it does give you the basics, however, this book focuses mostly on bowling drills."
5,Honest to Goodness is very true..........,"I am a Springfield, Illinois native and can tell you that these recipes are well known in the Springfield area. The recipes in this book are very very good.Some of my favorites include.....Lemon Shake-Ups as seen at the Illinois State Fair, Steak Diane as served at Baur's On the Green, Funnel Cakes And the all time Springfield favorite... HORSESHOES... if you don't know what this is I urge you to buy the book for that recipe alone! You will love it!"
5,The Sheltering Sky review,An excellent read. The book explores deeper into the characters psychies as the chapters continue. Mr. Bowles writing has ignited my interest in his entire works and I plan to read all of them.
2,Not about Morocco,Read this before we left for Morocco to get some background on the country but it was a somehhat dark tale about a dysfunctional relationship.
3,chicago soul,"the chi-lites were known for their early 70s masterpieces HAVE YOU SEEN HER and OH GIRL. there's a lesser hit called A LETTER TO MYSELF which really borrows a lot from their first big hit. and theres a few more sound a likes since they thought it was a winning formula. they never reached the heights of groups like the o'jays, stylistics, spinners and the like. i bought this for a very minor hit since i had the three previous hits. a song called MY HEART KEEPS ON BREAKING. it was so long ago but i remember really liking it. surprise surprise when i heard it again. it was a real stab at country for them. its funny to hear it now. the cd is nicely remastered and the booklet and liner notes are extensive and there might be another gem or two i didnt mention."
3,"good book, but too analytical","This book is good for introducing the concept of anima and animus. But it lacks some good examples from real life. Instead it gets hung up on analytical details to the extent of being ""anal."" I recommend this book but it does not make it into my favorite collection."
5,San Francisco 1982,"This CD captures a unique moment in the Saqn Francisco gay community pre-A.I.D.S. - the band is talented and has a great groove! The recording is live so audience participation can be heard and the quality of the recording is not studio-based. Favorite songs include 'Killer Purses', 'Sit on my face' and other Bay-area favorites! The sound and style of the band is a mix of bands that came later in the late 1980's but is thoroughly enjoyable and at times unique to itself. A good time warp listening experience!"
5,You can go home again,"You can go home again or at least the closest thing to it by reading this very entertaining book set in the coal region. As an ex-patriate of Shamokin I found the book to be a quick and enjoyable read. The people and places ring true and the fictional storyline of drugs and corruption provides some real excitement.Anyone who has grown up in a small town with ethnic communities will ""get"" this book. It's characters are universal. I've had the pleasure of meeting Jim(and his lovely wife Marie). Proving it's a small world we have both landed in Atlanta GA and live just a few miles from each other. We've enjoyed sharing stories about our lives and families in Shamokin and I'm looking forward to reading his next book(s)."
4,A testament to American Individualism,"This is a thoroughly American view on political theory given the emphasis on the individual coupled with the call for civil disobedience. Definitely not for the faint hearted, go into this with a grasp of the events of the day and a willingness to read the entire essay at least twice to fully appreciate Thoreau's points."
5,Don't buy this.,"I give it 5 stars because Civil Disobedience is a masterful bit of writing. However, save your money on this. It's my own fault for not reading the item description closer, but this is only the essay. It is 24 pages with no commentary or analysis provided. The essay is available to read freely online at numerous sites. I HIGHLY encourage everyone to read this essay, just don't spend your $$ for a paper copy of it."
3,Entertaining,"The movie is take from Sven Hasels Non-fiction books which have now been proven to all be made up. The story is fiction and should be treated that way. It is humorus, but a dark humor. Many of the actors have gone on to much bigger careers.It is not inteded to be a serious war movie and should not be taken that way. It is entertaining and makes light of something that was so serious.It is worth watching just to see what was in Sven Hassels books."
1,Cannot get to work on Windows XP,"After installing the game, when I tried to run it I get an error message that says ""need 3mb of virtual memory free"". I have plenty of virtual memory and my husband who is a computer expert could not get this program to run on our computer. We have Windows XP and it will not run in the compatability mode. My husband tried to tweek it to get it to run but could not do anything to get it to recognize our virtual memory. There is no technical support available for this game any longer."
1,Badly written tripe,If you're looking for a book that explores the true character of Martha Jefferson and her relationship with her husband...THEN DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. I can only assume that the other glowing reviews on this page were posted by the author's family. This book is not history--but romance- and it's not even well-written. Anyone associated with this thing should be embarrassed.
3,Pictures please!,"I was a little disappointed in this book -- didn't think it was nearly as good as Pearl Earring. But my reason for posting here is to talk about the physical book, rather than the writing. I loved the cover treatment and compliment all those involved in creating such an interesting presentation. But I can't help but wonder why color photos of the tapestries were not included -- I think they would have increased the reader's enjoyment enormously. For future readers, here's the link to the Museum of the Middle Ages in Paris, home of the tapestries. You can see them all online here: (...)"
1,Umm..did I read the same book as everyone else?,"What on earth did everyone else read?!?....this book isn't even worth 0.1 of a star. It's terrible! I'm pretty sure 20c mass produced romance novels are better than this drivel. I'm not really a fan of historical fiction, but it was given to me as a present so I felt I had to read it. The 'plot' is terrible. None of the characters have any depth or any real storyline.Our protagonist, if you can call him that; Nicolas, only has one trick up his sleeve to ""plough"" his girls...a tale about how a unicorn's horn makes everything pure. He then sets about trying to sleep with basically any girl over 12. There's a bit of talk here and there about tapestries...but I think a primary school course in art history can give you more meaningful information than this book. The story is complete nonsense and VERY poorly expressed and to be honest with you, I cannot believe it ever got published, let alone sold and read."
4,Tapestry History and Mystery,"The Lady and the Unicorn is Tracy Chevalier's fourth historical fiction. The Girl with a Pearl Earring remains my favorite, but this one runs a close second. Brussels and Paris are the two cities where the artists and tapestry weavers work for years in producing these six fine tapestries on display today at the Musee Cluny. The lady and maiden in the original paintings age and the author weaves a plot of fascinating contrasts with rich and poor. Tapestry history and characters laboring 24/7 to meet deadlines are conveyed in all their complexities. The sixth tapestry remains a mystery and makes one want to reread and look again at its beauty."
3,not as good as the Yoshiesque mixes or Penetrate Deeper,"Sharam and Ali return to GU with their second mix. Following on the quite lackluster Moscow (i'd give it 1.5 stars), which was sprinkled with some decent tracks (Word Unspoken and Rise as two examples), but at the same time cluttered with boring fare like Dido, iio, Fatboy Slim and Markus Schultz, this is definitely an improvement. Toronto is housier and groovier than the boys first GU.The first disc is overall very good and will garner repeat listens. The second disc, however, is disjointed in flow. I suppose it's worth the price if you're a GU listener who's been around since Tony de Vit's Tel Aviv and want to keep your collection complete. But, if you don't own Yoshiesque 1 (or Yoshi 2 to a lesser extent) or Penetrate Deeper (which is being re-released in Spetember of this year), then get these two first. I have all of Deep Dish's commercial work and these are my favorites."
3,Waited all this time for this?,"As Deep Dish fan for many years, I couldn't wait for this mix and bought it for a long road trip. After hearing the first couple tracks, I got pretty excited to listen to a much different Deep Dish sound than on their earlier mixes. Unfortunately, I was let down hard in the middle of CD1 and almost all of CD2. Instead of sounding like a set of highlights from a live set, this came off as a random portion of a longer set with lots of filler between good tracks. Maybe splitting resources across 4 CDs was too much to ask. Or maybe the lack of their own remixes/tunes due to licensing (Coldplay) or lack of time to make (P Diddy) is the cause. Either way, while not a horrible mix, it certainly lacks the Deep Dish punch that we have all grown to love. Until their next one, I'll probably be spending some time doing my own remix into a best of Toronto / Afterhours."
2,Suspenders BeltOutlet,"I ordered 54"", received 46"". Ask to send me 54"" I will return the 46"". No charge for shipping or exchange."
4,DM's Guide,"This book is pretty useful, it contains lots of info and the such on things such as poisons and reincarnation and even a chart of character flaws."
3,Short life span,"don't get me wrong...this iron works well at straightening your hair and it gets REALLY hot. However, it only served me for about a year, if that long. Last week, I went to turn it on, and ten minutes later the plates were still cold. I dont know what happened, because it was not dropped, the outlets were fine, and it showed no signs of wear. I was displeased with its short life span, because when you spend 40 bucks on something, you expect it to last more than a year."
1,Unsatisfied.,"This item was working great until just a few days ago. I only just bought it in December, 2005, and already it is broken. One of the sides no longer heats up! This is the second item from this brand I've had bad luck with."
2,Good While It Lasted,"It worked well, but the handle cracked near the change shortly after it was out of warranty."
4,good book,I love this book. The seller shipped very fast. The only thing that i dislike it is that I wish this book is that has list of many products that we can not find at all in stores. they had been discontinued.I think this is due because this book was published years ago and now most products no longer exist. But overal the book is a good book and easy to understand it.. I Need an updated version of it.
5,Women should read this before spending another dollar on cosmetics,"Although the book is too heavy to lug to the cosmetics counter, it is loaded with insightful, practical information on almost every product line out there. Some pricey products are actually worth their hefty tag, while others are not and there are less expensive and often more effective products available at the drug store.You'll find out here. I mainly bought it out of concern for harmful ingredients,I have sensitive skin and I do not want anything with parabens and pgb's and other potentially harmful chemicals in them. This book is helpful for any future cosmetics purchases I'll be making, and I've shared it with my daughters and friends. Its a worthwhile purchase for any woman."
2,Paula Begoun has her own cosmetic line which makes this book,"lose a lot of its credibility in my eyes. It was helpful in some areas, but I think it's fair to say that the majority of her reviews are very negative."
1,"Honestly, you should go to the counter without her!!!!","Coming from a clinique counter I can personally tell you that a lot of her information is incorrect. Now I believe that not every product is for everyone but she is giving you wrong product info. For instance she states that turnaround cream is a good moisturizer and that is it, Actually turnaround cream has NO moisturizers at all, it is a chemical exfoiliant maid to break down dead skin cells refine skin and diminish signs of aging. Or she states that All About Eyes can be a very good moisturizer for all over. Please don't do this, it is not a heavy enough moisturizer for your face, it is a hydrater and also it has a active ingredient of Caffeine to stimulate your capilaries to pool out some blood and thus reduce dark circles and puffiness. Please talk to a consultant before using a product. We are here for you and one last thing, she has nothing to back herself up in, she isn't a chemist or a doctor."
3,Use as reference book !,"I would suggest potential buyer to browse this book at a nearby bookstore before actually purchasing it. I read the book and although I didn't find her remarks sarcastic, I have to say that it would only be useful to people who wants to ""check out"" a new line of skin care or cosmetics. It was helpful in that it could provide insights to some of the VERY EXPENSIVE line, so in general it's a good reference book."
1,Misinformed,"I have read her book and, I am thankful that I went to the library versus buying her book. I have found a few errors and, am curious if she is being held liable for misinformation. I was an employee for a company that she reviewed and, I can tell you that she made false claims or incorrectly listed an ingredient in this particular line. Which completely discounts her credibility in my eyes. I encourage the potential buyer to be aware and check her credentials.You may be better off with an ingredient dictionary. 2 that come to my mind are A Consumer's Dictionary of Cosmetics Ingredients or What's in your Cosmetics."
5,the best book on beauty - the only one you need,"I will be short..after having read a handful of supposedly beauty books..this one does it : goes in depth in all hype trends...de-constructs all stupid claims..explains why expensive is not = to results etc......I have reduced my beauty bills from a lot to not even 50 usd per month all included (make up, creams etc...)"
1,The most ridiculous book I have ever read!,"This book is not to be taken seriously.First of all,the ratings are based on Paula's own preferences as a middle aged woman.Notice that she gives a bad rating to a lot of color cosmetic products based on their color or whether or not they contain shimmer rather than performance.I personally like blue eyeshadow and shimmery blushes and have tried many that stay on and look great.This book would have been a lot more helpful had Paula just stated the facts and left the ratings up to the individuals own judgement."
5,So happy with my new book,I love this book. It is full of knowledge. Talks about ALL cosmetics. It is very informative and worth every penny.
1,Disappointing,I had a similar experience to the prior users. I had to reinstall after a computer crash but was left high and dry by these crooks. The program wasn't that great to begin with (for the price)!
5,A very understandable Logic Text Book,This is an easy to understand text written in a light-hearted manner on a difficult topic. The topic is likely difficult because most education has now dropped formal logic from their offerings. We need to challenge how we think and this helps do that.
3,Gordon Scott IS Tarzan,"""Tarzan and the Trappers"" was a film re-edited from three 1958 pilot television shows for NBC produced by Sol Lesser. The pilots never sold NBC on the profitability for such a series. They starred Tarzan, Gordon Scott. The re-edited episodes followed conventional jungle drama concerning the whereabouts of ""lost treasure."" It is just average. ""Tarzan the Fearless"" has never been a faforite of mine so what else can I say. Buster was OK but just not one of my favorites in the role. I do like Gordon Scott and he saves this DVD. His performance as Tarzan was sincere and very effective. He was dedicated to the ideals of what Tarzan is all about."
4,Groovy French House...,"This 74 minute long cd is perfectly suited either for warming up before going out or dancing to at a party. If you are a fan of the French Disco House sound then tou will probably like this one. There are 22 tracks on the cd and they all very a lot in length. If I should compare this cd with another one then I would probably mention some of Dimitri's and Bob Sinclar's work (check Sinclar's lates release ""Africanism""!). The sound is traditional harmonic French House with a lot of funky and groovy Disco beats. But if you are looking for a ""deeper"" cd that you can listen to at all times then I will not recommend this one. This cd is more or less suited for a party or for warming up before you go to a club. But it is definetely worth buying!"
4,Great history of Engineering Feats,"I like the books by R.L.Stevenson so its really cool to see how he came by his experience. Granddad was a driven guy who forced everyone into the family business. R. was lucky to escape to become a no-account writer. Well books turn out to last longer than bricks. But still, its amazing to read that some of these lighthouses took ten years to build. The first summer's work having been washed away by the winter's storms. Plus the social aspect of the coastal towns which made their living from plundering the treasure (recycling?) of wrecked boats. They weren't all that interested in helping to put these lighthouses up. Eventually shame at the death of the sailors and persistence by the Stevensons got the job done.Anyway if you love books about the sea, you'll like this one. (typo's not withstanding)"
2,Disappointing,"After their amazing first album, which was the perfect blend of bilingual metal, jazz, and salsa, this one comes off as a huge disapointment. Somewhere, for some reason, they lost most of their salsa/jazz influences and went generic nu-metal (the downfall of metal) with latin percussion, something Sepultura masterd a long time ago (true metal, not this nu-metal [..]). There are still some gems, like Si Aja, Pa'Ti Pa'Mi, and Ahorake and the production/musicianship is still as good as before, but I found myself skipping through most of the songs. Get Fundamental instead."
2,Poorly written,"I was looking forward to reading this book, having read ""M; The Life of Caravaggio"" in the past. I was very disappointed. The writing level is extremely low. The characterization, dialogue, and description are around the level of a generic romance novel.Further, I recently read David Hockney's fascinating and convincing book ""Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters"" that demonstrates how optics were almost certainly used by artists of the time (and Artemisia is specifically sited with examples). Since the author of this Artemisia book seems unaware of the evidence (published in 2001), this book suffers from passionate descriptions (although not exacting) of foreshortening practice and other techniques that were unlikely to have been used by the artist. This poor research throws the authenticity of the whole book into serious question.If you're interested in painting, I would suggest you look elsewhere."
2,Definitely a novel...,This book is very interesting. I am disappointed that it can't be more non-fictional because Artemisia was an amazing painter for her time. Books that have half truth and half fiction are hard to deal with because one has to wonder wether it is real or not.
3,"Interesting Subject Matter, But","There were enough parts of this book to make me want to read to the end (exploration of an artist's thought processes, street scenes of Italy, the very fact that the character was the first woman admitted to the Florentine academy. Really enjoyed the side story of Graziela and thought that struggle between confinement and freedom, religious sacrafice and artistic freedom could be a book all of its own.) I found this writing detached and cool and very unpassionate. The dialogue was especially weak and it didn't help that it was all in modern vernacular overlaid on top of 1615 Italy."
5,A fun read especially for artist types,"I enjoyed this book. I'll read anything by author Susan Vreeland, after having read a couple of her books and been drawn into her stories fully during that time. A good read."
4,"Enjoyable, but not Girl in Hyacinth Blue","If I'd never read Girl in Hyacinth Blue I wouldn't know what this story doesn't have. It doesn't have the depth and fascinating details of Vreeland's Blue. But, it does have a good story, and one that made me want to know more about the non-fictional Artemesia. The stories behind the paintings were intriguing, and enough to keep my interest. I hope there are more artist books to come."
4,Artemisa,"Loved it to death... an easy read with historical inaccuracies and even a dash of bodice ripping...but who cares? Vreeland tells a vibrant story about craft, father-daughter wounds, passion for calling, and feminism.Females artists have come a long way...but not nearly long enough. Susan Vreeland clearly lives inside her characters."
4,"Excellent murder mystery, well worth reading","The edition I have of this book quoted Agatha Christie as saying ""I feel I am justified in saying [this book] is among my best"". It is definitely the best of the dozen or so Christie books I have read. A breezy 160-pages, unfortunately. Pick it up anyway. Read it in a day :)"
5,AC/DC As Loud As Can Be,"This was the first live album I ever owned, and it has made it nearly impossible for me to listen to studio tracks of anything. Because of ACDC live, I judge a band on live performance above all. Just about anyone can sound good in the studio, but it's a lot harder to sound this good live.I really recommend this to anyone, even just casual ADCD listener. You'll know all the songs, and you'll get caught up in the excitement of the crowd and the band."
4,You have to go to a live show at least once,"I went 15 years between concerts and the band doesn't miss a beat. I recommend seeing the concert, going back and buying ""If You Want Blood You Got It"", and just turning this release up until the neighbors knock down your door with the police and/or your parents kicking you out of the house. Brian Johnson mixes some classics from present to past honoring the late, great, but never straight Bon ""may you always rest in peace"" Scott."
2,Oops!,"I used to have an old tape of live AC/DC that had some of the best guitar I'd ever heard. I wanted to recapture that energy and, after quickly scanning the line-up, mistakenly picked up this CD. Johnson's attempts at Scott's creations don't cut it and Angus seems a bit tired compared to ""If You Want Blood..."" (which is what I meant to buy). ""Rosie"" is the best cut, but again, doesn't compare to the younger Angus' frenzied masterpieces found on ""If You Want Blood..."" (Bottom line: go there first)."
2,to indulgent for most tastes!,"In 92 Ac/dC live came out in both single and double editions. Neither one is really that great! Ac/Dc is one of hard rock/metal's best groups,but just like everyone else, not everything that they do is good. One of the biggest flaws of the album is that it is too self indulgent. Most people don't want to hear songs in excess of ten minute running times. Another flaw is that the Bon Scott era is not represented very well, I know he's dead, but most of Ac/Dc's better albums were from the Bon Scott era. Highway to hell is only represented by the title track, big mistake there Highway to Hell is just as good as Back in Black if not better! Also not enough from High Voltage. The sound quality isn't that bad, but the song selections could have been better, so I must only recommend this album for die hard Ac/Dc fans, the ones why buy everything they release whether good or bad!"
1,"Same as others, ripped off on volume.","I guess I should believe the reviewers. If I got 75 feet out of this 100' roll, I'd be suprised. What a ripoff, stay away from this manufacturer."
3,Not 100 feet,"Everyone else is right. I only got 85 feet on my spool. But the wire does what it is supposed to do.If you buy this, plan accordingly and assume you will be short changed."
4,Great Speaker wire,This is great speaker wire. The reason I only gave 4 stars is because the image on the product page is not the actual same packaging for product I received.
3,It's not even a 100 ft long,"I bought 2-100ft wire and during installation I noticed that I'm short by 10ft, yes it's only 90ft long. So I open the other one and same thing. But I have to install it since I have the time, it's a little tight but just made it where I want the speakers to be. I always like to put some extra in case I need to move the speakers. The wire itself is a very high quality product, no regrets on getting this wire it's just this company seems to be a little short on their product information.So I called Amazon the next day to inform this and they immidieately refund some money to me for the missing 20ft cable. Amazon is know for best service and that's the reason why I'm still buying from their website.Hope this helps.John"
2,These wire don't come in 100 ft spool,"I'll second all these previous reviews about these wires don't come in 100 ft per spool. I ordered two 100 ft spools, one spool comes with only 80 ft, and the second one comes in two pieces:60 ft and 30 ft. I've concluded the manufactuer don't have the intention to fix the problem. If you can live with the quality control of the footage, these wires appear in good quality and the price is reasonable."
1,100 feet is only 88.5feet cable is short by huge amount-china,"This is the worst case of stealing from the consumer in a long time. The cable is not all copper, just one side and the length is 11 1/2 feet short of 100ft! wow! This product is shown on other sites[google search] as almost always short by huge amounts of feet not 2 inches, but eleven plus feet short.I had to drive 70 miles to pick up a cable after this lemon came. I could not finish the install that day. waste of time for this raptor wire.very poor of the china manufacture...buy USA"
1,It is too bad I couldn't choose zero stars,"This book appears to have been thrown together without anyone trying the recipes to see if the results are actually edible, or if all the ingredients we were asked to gather were used. It is frustrating to be told to mix ""all ingredients,"" then two sentences later be told to put in another of the ingredients. This is one example of many. The directions are sketchy or downright inaccurate. There are so many obvious typos, that I wonder how many of the ingredients and amounts are accurate or are also typos. I dislike this book so much that I will not even give it away. What a waste of money. This book may be good on the ""lore"" side, but it is not a cookbook. I am still looking for a good cookbook tailored to home storage. This isn't it."
3,"The information itself is Recommended but if spelling errors annoy you, stay away from this one.","A helpful book in that it includes information on rehydrating freeze dried and dehydrated foods, how to cook and combine them, how to substitute stored foods in place of fresh ingredients and includes many recipes that a normal person would eat on a normal basis - soups, casseroles etc. But there are so many typographical and grammatical errors it is hard to believe this book made it through any proofreader at all. Although that aspect is very annoying, it is still the best reference cookbook available in this category and the most helpful."
2,Be caucious when trying out new recipes in this book.,"Some of the neccessary ingredients are not listed in many of the recipes, which makes me wonder if the authors ever tried out the recipes themselves. Many of the recipes are old family heirlooms, that may have been written down, without trying to re-create the final dish from the written directions."
5,Cookin' with Home Storage,We keep FD and dehydrated food products at our little vacation place and this book makes it so easy to use them. Lots of old recipes and great tips. Saves hauling groceries in and trips to the not-so-close market. I really like this book
1,Not what I expected,"A Mormon cookbookThe book starts off with a historical background on Brigham Young and then leads into recipes like ""Brigham Tea"", ""Mormon Sage Tea"" and ""Mormon Soda Biscuits"". No Thanks."
1,Dont waste your money,I had hoped this book would save me from having to delve into the complete Roberts Rules of Order.Unfortunately it is too basic and does not go into any depth.
3,Disappointed first-time Eco reader,"I recently heard Umberto Eco interviewed on NPR regarding his new novel ""The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana"" and was intrigued. However, upon reading the book I was extremely disappointed. The concept was original, but the book was monotonous and unrealistic. What man loses his memory and then seems to accept blindly what others tell him? Although he returns to his country home of Solara to regain his childhood memories, at no time does he receive professional help or seem to be really bothered by living among strangers. He accepts everything as if it really doesn't bother him to not recognize or know anyone. He certainly is an emotionless character and the reader doesn't feel any empathy. The book was dry and emotionless. The most interesting part is when he is in a coma. I would not recommend this book. I feel like I wasted my time. Maybe his other works are better-- I just don't have any interest in pursuing them anymore."
5,From South Florida,"Incitive and breathtaking storytelling! Anyone who was alive during any of the mentioned periods, lived abroad or traveled either physically or by reading, will acknowledge the influential significance of propaganda, of smells and tastes of our past, of music and encounters. I was excited and filled with significance and fear and appreciation of our world as I read this beautifully written story. Umberto Eco is a master storyteller and he has awakened memories and senses which udually are pushed aside as overrated nostalgia, but are clearly components of our current existence."
3,Drop the Heavy Dream like prose please,"This is a very engrossing book, both in respect to its literary references and in the glimpse it provides of Child growing up in Italy in the 1930's and 40's. I marked it down to three stars solely because of the last fifty pages. I understand that the author is trying to create a dreamlike stream of conscious atmosphere, but the prose so difficult follow that the ultimate result simply confusing and should not be accepted as a replacement for literary depth. I would blame it on the translator were it not for the excellent job he accomplishes in the earlier section of the novel. The outstanding illustrations are the only redeeming quality to be found in the final pages."
5,I LOVE this book!,"This book is giving me such insight and such a different perspective on things I've read many, many times. Some days I can hardly wait to pick it up as I study God's Word in an effort to gain new insights! I've already recommended this book to a number of people."
4,Pretty Good,"My favorite songs on this album are probaly Back Here, Next Time, and Gohst of You And Me. It's not my fave album but it's pretty good."
4,Good album,This album is good for a first try. They aren't your typical boyband either. They play their own instruments and wrote half the songs. The best songs are Back Here and Ghost Of You And Me. Some songs are weak but overall this album is great
5,My BBMak Review,"If you like the goo goo dolls or 98 degrees then you will love BBMak's cd(sooner or later). they have awesome voices and they harmonize great toghether. It's a really great cd and you don't have to skip any songs because the songs are all great. My personal favorites are ""I can tell"", ""Love is leaving"" and ""Can't say"" but all of the songs are good, so if you don't have this cd yet, I urge you to go out and buy! They are really talented and their sound is not like the sound of ""boybands"" today...their sound is more unique and soothing."
5,The Most Therapeutic CD Out There,"The sweet harmonies and wistful melodies on BBMak's CD Sooner or Later are one of the most beautiful things that have ever reached my ears. The 95% of the songs are written by Bbmak and the instrumentals on the tracks are also played by them. These three very talented Brits are a refreshment from the cookie-cutter boy bands and girl bands that have been invading the pop scene lately. This is a real band!! Whenever stressed out, these songs about lost love, true love and love that is just out of reach totally relax and exhilarate the mind!"
1,"Should be titled ""A little more LOUSY!""","Does Lindsay Lohan and Ashlee Simpson share family genes? They must, because they both scream alike and both suck as singers! This wanna-be Brittany Spears (AIN'T SAYIN' MUCH!), better stick to the Hollywood party scene and join the valley girl's cheerleading squad! This one star rating is a gift 'cause it doesn't rate that! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR EARS!"
5,LLo proves herself 10 fold!,"This is an awesome album! Run...don't walk to buy it (I did) and believe me it's worth it! L.Lo rocks out on this album with personal songs like secret windows into her life, you'll definitely feel deep and fall in love with this CD. I'm surprised but so proud that she seems to be coming into her own style of music, instead of just dishing out the same been said a million Xs before type pop songs..(as everyone else seems to be doing). Just get it, ASAP!My favorite songs so far1.Confessions of a Broken Heart2. Black Hole3.I Live for the Day4.My Innocence5.A Little More Personal6. If it's Alright7.If You Were Me8. Edge of Seventeen9.A Beautiful Life (and that's more then 1/2 of the album so it's definitely worth the buy!"
3,No difference at all.,"I'm actually a little disappointed by her album..When I heard her song,Confessions of a broken heart,I thought her album would be a bit like Kelly Clarkson's;strong vocals and smooth voice..but by listening to her sing,I feel uncomfortable..like she is forcing herself to sing..(its just how I feel) her songs are all about the same tune and beat...its really not a nice album..her album is not better than her previous one,Speak.At least Speak has different tunes..hmm.Rating: 3/10 (poor singing and songs)"
5,"Excellent, Classy Album by Lindsay Lohan","I love this album, the style is old fashioned. The lyrics are deep, cute, and enjoyable. I'd loved every second of it! Awesome, awesome album.Worth every cent."
5,Incredible! Keep singing Lindsay!,"IF Lindsay has improved this much from Speak to A Little More Personal (RAW) I can only imagine how amazingly awesome her next album will be. This is one of my favorite albums to listen to right now, her voice is sheer emotion. Very pleasurable listen."
5,"Live it, Love it, Lohan...","The CD is great. I started off only listening to a couple of the songs I had heard previously (Confessions of a Broken Heart and Edge of Seventeen), but within the second day of listening, I started to love the rest of the songs as well.They are all great, and they all say something different.If you listen to the lyrics close enough, you learn a little bit more about Lindsay, and love her even more. It takes some listening to get used to the songs and fully enjoy them, but they are all good and definitely worth the buy."
3,Livin' la vida Lohan,"Lindsay Lohan transitioned from movie star to a semi-successful musician. On her debut record she delivered the typical Ashlee Simpson-ish pop/rock, but on A Little More Personal (RAW) she lets go and delivers...in most respect. Though not nearly as listenable as her last, RAW's power lies more in its softer tracks, like opener and first hit ""Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)"" and the album's thought-provoking closure. It may not be as irresistible as her first, but Lohan proves she is becoming a musical power to be dealt with."
1,can this girl od already,"sick of lindsay, sick of her going to jail, sick of her doing drugs, sick of her confusded sexuality please anna nicole was less anooying buut don't worry folks lindsay won't see 35."
4,When life make us create a darker ego,"Well this is the second album of Lindsay Lohan, i must confest that is much darker than the first one, but in the end is a little more of the same. However this second album is an excellent feast for the ears and an excellent piece of creativity and psychological work. I recommend this album when you are so much angry and hate the world, after listening the entire album you will feel a little more raw."
3,A Decent Followup,"I enjoyed ""speak"", Majority of the songs I would sing along to and just have a good guilt free time. Then I stumbled across Lindsay's second album A Little More Personal. When I first listened to this, I could see that Lindsay was trying to be a little more serious in her songs. The emotional Confessions Of A Broken Heart and the depressing ""My Innocence"". It's completely diffirent material than speak. But when I heard this album more and more it wouldn't sink in. Speak was just plain pop fun and A little more personal well is sort of bland. I do like black hole and recommend listening to it. Overall I give this album three stars.."
3,Good,"This albun is a lot better then ""Speak"". ""A Little More Personal"" shows more maturity and growth. The production was, unfortunetly, very rushed and more money and time should have gone into it. The best song, in my opinion, is the title track ""A Little More Personal"". Another good song is ""If It's Alright"", they should both become singles. ""I Live For The Day"" was originally going to be the 2nd single, but I heard that it will be ""Fastlane"" becuase that song will be featured in Lindsay's new movie.Overall, I'd recomend you just download the good songs from iTunes."
3,Good read,There is really not much material available on Neil Diamond. So in that respect the book does quite well and sheds a lot of light on some of Diamond's albums and singles on the chart. Wish there was more stuff on the subject himself.
2,To much of the authors opinion of what Neil thinks,"Don't Judge this book by its Cool Cover. I LOVE NEIL but this is a puff piece, way to much of the authors opinion of what Neil thinks. Her opinions of the bands and the era's is a joke. It's like written by the church lady. I hope I can find another book with a more Neilistic view.I did learn some things but overall I was kinda disappointed and Wanting a whole lot more."
3,Doctor finds Lawyer = struggle ensues!,"Part of the series(5minute Bride, and Troublemaker Bride are the others), this Leanne Banks' heroine is fun, feisty and independent. She has reached a point when she wants more than career and an old childhood friend returns with more on his mind than winning or catching up to Jenna in a race! This time he says he's ""gonna keep her!"" It's the typical situation when the girl doesn't understand why she's drawn to him--he certainly isn't her type but he has set his goal and all her friends can see the sparks between them! A good read for a beach vacation or an evening when you just want to escape into someone's perfect life! Both main characters have reached success in their lives but need the things in life that really matter!"
5,Good,"It was good as far as the history of beer and beer makeing. I am a home brewer I was hopeing for a little more info that would help with my own beers, still ti was a fun read."
5,1255214104310102168001431211 [5],This is a very good cd. The cover is beautifully created. The music is very soothing to help you relax. I highly recommended [4]
5,great speakers,"Well worth the 250 dollars I spent on them. The sound quality is very good for the size of the speakers. I will be purchasing a pair of floorstanding speakers and may be replacing the center channel with a larger one, but since my stereo supports 7.1, it won't be a total loss. Beats Bose any day of the week."
1,hate it,the jokes are not funny!!!!!!!!!!!! I hate it!!!!!! 0 out of 5 star don't buy it!!!!!!!!! try the sample to see what I mean!!!
2,Cruel and Unusual Punishment,"Like the revolution that forms the subtext of this book, the story of these women while interesting lacked that crucial element - characterization. The three principles were alternately whining, mean and supremely egotistical. The only one I vaguely sympathized with was the mother, Sumin? (Who could have become a person with a mother like she had?) The other two were not fleshed out enought to illicit any real feelings for them (the grandmother (Celine) at best two dimensional through her historied past - the daughter (Cameron) simply a narcissistic brat.Perhaps I don't understand the Chinese mind well enough to appreciate the strange stinginess of these characters souls..."
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"Think twice before you spend the $ for this grill. It's not worth it. In the spirit of full disclosure, this is my first gas grill. I have used charcoal for over 20 years. But, the time had come, or so I thought. First, gas grills add virtually no flavor to the food. The flavorizer bars are no substitute for charcoal. Second, and more relevant to the Summit C, is the built in smoker. It's a joke. Yes, it works well and creates lots of smoke, but the smoke directly exits the grill housing. Because Weber put it on the side, the smoke does not even touch the food. Instead, it snakes up the side wall and exits through the back vent. Without the smoke or real grill flavor, the Summit C is nothing more than a glorified outdoor oven. Do yourself a favor and get a cheaper model if baking outside is your plan. If not, don't even bother. What a waste."
3,Reminiscent of self-help books,"The research presented in this book is quite interesting, but stylistically, I found the writing to be a bit too verbose and redundant. I also felt that at times, the book verges on self-help territory; however, Csikszentmihalyi is one of the most renowned psychologists of the last few decades, so his advice comes with a lot more credibility than your average self-help guru."
5,Changed my life,This book was life-changing for me. The research behind flow is fascinating and I highly recommend all of Dr. Csikszentmihalyi's books.
3,Why is the Kindle edition more than the paper edition?,I don't understand why you are selling the kindle edition for more than the paper edition when the kindle edition has negligible reproduction costs. Please pass on the computer savings to those of us who want to buy this book and any Amazon book as an ebook.
3,It's almost perfect,"I bought this product a few weeks ago. It's a bit too long for me, I'm 5'6' so I wrap a little bit of the rope on each side. It makes a loud wooshing sound, which was a bit of a downside for me because I prefer to exercise discreetly in my yard. It also leaves welts on your body wherever it hits. You learn not to make any mistakes lol.But it's a fine product and almost perfect."
1,"Bought 2, both Defective - unable to adjust","I am sure I am following the instructions correctly. I have read all the positive reviews here, and understand what they say about how easy it is to adjust the length. If it is that easy, mine are just defective. I pop the caps off the handle, and try to slide the rope out the opening, but it will NOT budge. The metal cringe is kinda stuck on the top side of the plastic handle, where I cannot reach to even tinker with it. Heck, I bought this after reading the overwhelmingly positive reviews, but have to say that I must belong to the small minority that got saddled with the defective pieces."
2,"Very Thick, not that great","I recommend getting the RX rope, with bearings and optional wire sizes. I went through two of this style - Nike's and this one, before I finally caved in and bought the $35 RX brand.Not terrible, but anyone doing double unders or wants to use this on a regular basis should invest in a better one."
5,Perfect for me,"I'd definitely dock some points if I had to make any adjustments to the length of the rope, as I don't see how that would be easily done, but these fit me perfectly (I'm about 5'10.5 with average wingspan for reference).Durability is pretty solid -- a friend who I workout with had his jump rope handles snap on a similarly priced pair within only a few uses, and these are still going strong for me."
2,"Great quality, Hard to adjust.","Had no problems w/ delivery (and I live in The Bahamas). The high quality of the rope is noticed upon opening the package. BUT, my major issue (like some of the other consumers state), is adjusting the rope. Wish it was easier to adjust. I ordered the right length 9' for my height 5' 11"" meaning I should NOT have to adjust it @ all but I do and the caps (on the package it says to remove them) on both ends won't budge, I'm stuck and honestly thinking of purchasing another rope."
5,pretty great,I like it. It was easy to adjust to my size. I use it regularly. Seems to be good quality. Feels definitely nice to handle. Just make sure to wear some kind of shoes if you do not want to hurt your feet.
5,Jumping for Joy,I bought this jump rope for exercise between weight lifting sets as a way to keep my heart rate up. The handles have nice cushion to them and the rope itself has a decent amount of weight. I've used jump ropes in the past that are so light that I trip over them frequently. Not the case with this one. The product seems well made and I'm glad I bought it.
3,an OK product,"Decent product, really long so you have to cut some off more then likely. Only real downfall of the product, is if you have it rolled up like the picture, or folded, or in any way compacted, it really likes to stay that form, ie not straightening out for the workout."
1,Ugh...,"Same problem; couldn't get the clamp out of the handle. How do you mess up something as simple as a jump rope? Seriously, you're better off finding a rope and hooking swivels and wood to the ends yourself. It's that easy. I wish I did before buying this."
2,Hard to adjust and knots up easily...piece of junk,"As everybody else said, adjusting this thing is a big problem.Some other reviews said that it came with and extra crimp but I don't recall receiving on of those with mine. When I went to adjust it I tried just cutting off the extra and tying a knot, but when I put it back in it didnt fit and messed up the bearings inside so I couldn't jump for more than two skips with it.I'm exactly 6 feet tall by the way and it was a few inches too long for me, so unless you are super tall I wouldn't recommend buying this.On top of that, the rope curls and knots up really easily making it even harder to use.The only reason I give it two stars is because it's only 7 dollars...you get what you pay for, I guess."
5,Good Value for the Price,"So far, this jump rope has been a good addition to my work out collection. I have not had to adjust the length, so have not run into problems like some people have. For the price, this jump rope was a good deal."
3,it loops on it's self.,"Don't get me wrong, it's a jump rope and all, but because of the material and the way it was packaged, it has tons of ways and crinkles and while I'm skipping, it loops on it's self. It's what I deserve for you know 3 bucks."
4,Good Speed Rope,"I liked this rope a lot. The 1 year warranty is very nice as well. I am 6'2"" and I had to shorten the rope a little bit. I noticed after the first really hard/long speed test the rope appears to be melting/wearing down wear the rope touches the handle (about 1 cm out from the handle). The ball bearing works fine, it just appears that this may become an issue. I have been using the rope for two months however and it seems to be holding up fine (plus there is the warranty). All that aside (it is just a jump rope after all) I would would recommend this rope to anyone... its like 8 bucks. No Brainer."
1,This jump rope sucks,"I literally used this jump robes for 3 times, and it broke right in the middle of the rope.It is ridiculous, I will never shop this brand again, so disappointed."
3,"Great for jumping, but adjustable?","It works great as a jump rope. However, I expected it to be adjustable multiple times. I did not know, until it arrived, that it was a metal crimp which could take a one-time adjustment for permanently changing the length. This will not work for multiple people using multiple lengths over and over again. In the average customer's eyes, ""adjustable"" means over and over again. Not one-time."
1,Impossible to Adjust!,"I'm not sure if there are several different designs on the market, but this speed rope was IMPOSSIBLE to adjust. I'm pretty handy and have access to lots of tools; didn't matter. After 20 minutes of swearing Valeo to the depths of hell, I gave up and returned it. I bought two of these speed ropes. Out of four handles, only one end of the rope could be extended through the handle for adjustment. This resulted from an obvious design flaw of a narrow passage on the handle. Save yourself the trouble and buy a competitor's rope."
1,Lasted only three months,"This was a fine jump rope while it lasted. I purchased it in May and it was pronounced dead by the middle of August. Rope snapped off at the end of one handle, as if the friction of turning had burned it clean through. I skip rope outdoors for about thirty minutes four or five times a week, so it's not like the Valeo endured excessive wear. It's just made of cheap materials, I suspect. I won't purchase again."
1,Adjustable Fail.,"This rope comes at it's max length with very difficult to adjust metal clamps. First, the directions to adjust the rope are not comprehensive. Secondly, the metal claps which hold the end of the ropes in the handle are too easy deformed making it extremely difficult to do it correctly and/or to be able to slide it down the rope to the appropriate length. I failed at this and tied a knot instead because it was becoming too epic. However, if that happens there is a 100% chance the ball bearing on said jump rope with no long function on the knotted-side handle thus creating tangles in the rope almost immediately.This product is trash, the design and the construction of the clamp is absolutely criminal and goes against every law of common sense and engineering. Therefore I highly recommend buying a similarly priced but superior product from a competitor (as found at local stores near you for similar prices)."
4,A first jump rope I can be proud of,"It took just a minute to adjust the length; the instructions on the flip side of the package cover made it all very clear. It's true that the rope seems to want to twist a little after jumping a bit, but I think it's probably just my inexperience. With time I'm convinced it'll ease up. I like the quality of the handles and the color (solid black). For the price, I don't think you can beat it."
2,Two days and it broke!,"It could have been a great product except it broke already after only two days of use, no abuse or anything, never hit anything while using it on a very open space with no obstacle. The cable snapped while I was using it, However, it was great when it didn't break it was a little pain adjusting to it but as long as you have pliers it easy to adjust (I actually used two pliers.) I gave it one extra star, it may be just a fluke that I had a bad one but I'll give this another shot."
1,dont waste your time,"ya ok its a nice rope for the price of 8 dollars. Adjusting it is not a problem, but if you are really into jump rope training i recommend the aero speed jump rope by buddy lee. it may cost $40 but it is all worth it, easy to adjust, delivers a great workout and you will never need another rope. just check it out for yourself.Aero Speed Hyperformance Jump Rope"
2,Useless,"The adjusting is not the problem, took 2 sec (though remember to measure twice, cut once) The rope itself was useless though, winds up into a useless ball"
1,Do Not Purchase,"I'm a fairly skilled jump roper and always keep on in my gym bag to warm up or as an alternative to speed runs on certain days. I purchased this jump rope a few months ago and thought that once I had broken it in, it would do the trick. Unfortunately, after months of bruising myself during basic exercises, I tossed it and I'm currently looking for a replacement. This jump rope is not worth one dollar, don't waste your money."
1,...,"Looks like I wasted my money on this. I should've taken 1 of the reviewers advice and not buy it. This jump rope clearly states that it has cancer causing chemical/materials. I was afraid of using it so I threw it away. Oh nevermind, I used it once but it isn't a great jump rope at all. For the price, you have a chance of getting cancer and a not so good quality piece of rope."
2,Not very good,I was expecting a bit too much but after 3 weeks of use the jump rope handle ripped from the rope itself. You get what you pay for so find a better rope but this one please try to avoid. Its not worth it
3,The price..,I found it kind of funny that after I put this box set in my wish list the price went up. I wanted it but I don't want it that bad.
2,Not what it is cracked up to be...,"While the text of the book is useful, none of the promised web material (source code to the examples) is available."
2,Cuban Cheese,"I'm usually a fan of ""tribute"" CD's, unfortunately I found this one to be a disappointment. A few of the selections have interesting rhythmic and acappella arangements, ""Because"" and ""Hello Goodbye"". But most of it just comes accross as rather cheesy. It sort of sounds like a Carribean cruise ship band recorded this. It could use a little more edge. Where's Ry Cooder when you need him?"
3,Interesting CD,This CD was more interesting than anything. Some of the renditions were outright goofy but enjoyable overall. I'd say buy it to support the Cuban musicians that made it.
5,Great book,This is a great re-print of a book which I had been after since I saw the earlier Leather Bound edition. A great book for anyone interested in rifles and shooting thru the ages
1,Don't buy this toy,The ants all piled up in the tubes and died. It was very hard to feed them and they all ran from starvation into the tunnels and died there.
2,That's him all over.,"SHOT TO PIECES(2002) a very low budget direct to video biography docudrama similar in style to THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS of one William F. Bartlett who, a Union officer in the Civil War, managed to fight in the Battles of Ball's Bluff, Yorktown, Port Hudson and the Crater leaving pieces of himself all over as he went along.Not bad. Not good. There."
4,Great Performance in Mediocre Sound,"This is a recording of very fine live performance at La Scala in either 1951 or 1952. It has an ""all star"" cast, with the finest Falstaff of our times, the inimitable Mariano Stabile. Unfortunately the sound is not good - probably a four or five on a scale of ten.For a full review of the performance (in what I believe is the best remastered sound) seeVerdi: Falstaff."
1,junkij,Kworld is everywhere and its all junk i've tried so many of there devices just to have to deal with crap software and strange delays
4,Now This Makes Sense - It's a Mammoth,"I tried to listen to Dillinger Escape Plan, and I just didn't get it, so I tried Converge, and like it better, but I got a headache after a while, so I tried Mastodon - and now I love this album.If Metallic had any balls, and stopped playing the same chords over and over, they'd have come up with this genre way before these guys from Atlanta. Great songs, catchy riffs, and is that more than one singer I hear? Believe it or not, playing so hard, so heavy, so fast, and so complicated is, well, complicated. Dillinger does it, and doesn't make any sense. Mastodon does it, and rocks it out.This album is apparently inspired by Moby Dick - a real whale of a tale, I hear. If you like Beyond the Embrace, get Leviathan, it's so much better. I even hear a little early Prong (like Forced Fed) influence. As for Remission, the band's first release, I think they kind of sleep-walked through that one. A 200% improvement over that. Leviathan is a Whooly Mammoth."
1,Mastodon is so bleh...,"I realy do not know what people see in mastodon ? I mean, mastodon's songs are so fogetable,annoying, cheesy and whats with the southern rock feel ? It just doesn't fit with the agressive sound at all...What's mastodon trying to be? Down? If so, they need to stop it, before Phil beats them up. Ha ha. If you guys wnat a band that has songs you will foget three minutes after you hear it and a sound that just doesn't do anything for you but either bores you or makes you angry of how cheesy it is. I always felt that mastodon's music has always been rushed and you know what? It has and i hope they suffer for it. If you love true metal, do not even bother!"
4,sea bed sludge,four stars because the mix is so precambrian it never leaves the muffled slime....just listen to iron tusk it is like being on the platform of a busy station...some one remaster it please
1,Jurado's license has expired.,"Jurado's earlier attempts, in particular ""Rehearsals For Departure"" were complete successes- ""Postcards and Audio Letters,"" however, is the worst purchase I have ever made. Amazon.com fails to mention that this is a spoken-word CD- far beyond the reaches of Jurado's poetic license as a virtual nobody in the music world. Everybody should own some Jurado. Nobody should own this this particular Jurado."
2,Jordan,"I put two stars because they technically are pens and I'm sure they work, but they aren't the solid and respectable colors advertised. I got them for a seminar class where key and annotation is required and using pale pink, purple, fuscia and other pastel colors won't help me very much...again, working pens, not the multiple colors that are in the photo."
5,Anointed and slammin!,"I thought this album was wonderful. Very anointed, and is what I expect from Rodney Cunningham. I know that this project will go far, and bless the world.Minister Rodney Archie"
4,DashMat,"This product is awesome, however on the description it says it attaches via velcro, ell the velcro didn't come in the box. So noway to attach my dashmat to my dash board."
2,Not satisfied,"Book condition not as good as describe, dented at book cover. No Study Tool CD-ROM attached together with the book."
1,Possibly a Perfectly Horrible Text,"The circuitous and unsubstantiated pathways in this textbook caused me to drop the class the first time I entered physics. Many chapter questions are not covered clearly enough in the reading, which I pored over time after time. Many males seem to appreciate it however, which makes me wonder if there isn't a gender slant (or boost) in the style in which it is written.The following year I switched to a class using Giancoli's text and scored an A - and it wasn't because of the professor."
2,this for the the small pack,this is for 3 small limewood air stones they don't indicate that this is for small not happy doesn't fit my skimmer
1,SORRY FOR NOT PUBLISHING THIS EARLIER,"The same performance is found in ""Europa Konzert From Palermo"" togather with Brahms's violin concerto that I bought four years ago. The performance was very good and the picture was quite good.I bought the current disc thinking it is a newer recording with better picture. It turned out to be the same recording and no improvement in the picture, although it has half the music and they could reduce the picture compression.It is also rediculous that this disc is more expensive. So buy the Eoropa concert, save some morey and have more music."
1,"Run, don't walk.","In over 20 years of working with commercial software (for 8 years as an editor for a major computer magazine), I have rarely come upon a program as bad as this one. It crashes constantly, it runs slowly, it does not provide error messages to guide you. Prior to installing EMC8, I rarely had problems with Windows XP Pro; now, the system hangs frequently, always when some component of EMC8 is running. The ""support"" for this product is a joke. In my experience, on-line ""chat"" is never available. The ticket-based help system takes forever to respond--if they respond at all--and good luck trying to find a phone number to speak to a live person.I have no idea if other programs work better than this one. Before buying EMC8, I read many, many reviews and they all seemed equivocal about pros and cons. I bit the bullet and bought EMC8, a decision that I will regret for a long time."
1,This product is not intended for people to use,"This is poorly designed and poorly tested software. Really common and basic capabilities like file-->open for editing exising labels don't exist or work sensibly, on installation all dates on jpg files are changed (modified date)to the date the software is installed, slide shows don't rebuild without fiddling around with the audio files, check boxes for audio don't activate when displayed, sound tracks on DVD slide shows skip and don't sync when new pictures are added to a show. Ignore the professional reviewers, this is awful.However, if you like puzzles, Media Creator is for you. Roxio didn't have a concept of how people use computers with version 5.0, it's gone downhill from there."
1,I felt violated,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Unstable, resource hog and nearly unusable. Burned 3 DVD+R DL coasters before I got a working copy. I felt like I had been violated by Roxio with the money I spent on this garbage."
3,Tivo2 Problem out of the box,"Just installed Roxio Creator 8.0 Suite and I'm now in an endless loop with a TivoToGo ""Enter Playback Password"" loop. Even a reboot won't get rid of the endless nag. No password will shut it up either. Apparently it is related to the Roxio Media Manager Services. Now let's see about that legendary Roxio Customer Support..."
2,Summary of Easy Media Creator 8.0,"The new version does not stand out as well as the old Roxio, 6.0 or 7.0. - Roxio 8.0 does not burn as fast as promised. - The system requirement are too high, and it takes up to much ram to use Roxio 8.0. For the average PC it is useless. It is not as user friendly as the previous (2) version. I would like to return it. The labels are not as good as the previous one!!!-I do hope the next version will be an inprovement over this one.Viola B Sith673 Alta View CourtWorthington, OH 43085"
1,Product is not reliable,I purchased Roxio Easy Media Creator 8.0 to archive TIVO content. This product does not work as expected on my PC; it often freezes up and I have to reboot. The Roxio product has been available for several months yet they have NO online updates to this product.I have been using Nero 6.6 for the past year with no problems. I like the Nero product but it does not support TIVO content.
1,A waste of money!!!,This program is totally a waste of money! All Roxio has done is copy other programs and tried to present them as theirs!! This program does not work as claimed by Roxio! I had to remove it from my PC to get it to function again!Also by buying this product from Amazon I know I would never be able to return it! I suggest that you try another program of this type for burning CD/DVD's but NOT Roxio and NOT from Amazon!!
3,A BIG Bundle!,"I have used other digital media software over the last couple of years but am an amateur generally. For the price this package is a great value. However, the scope of the package is also a drawback. This toolbox of media software contains many different items some of which appear to overlap. If you are starting out I'd recommend a more focused approach using a narrower package with better instructional material. For example, if you are starting our with photo organizing and editing get Adobe Elements. When you move on to video get MyDVD for example. A great value is not always a good buy."
1,Problems with projects created by 7.0 and opened by 8.0,"After I installed 8.0 I had to reinstall 7.0 to get my previous Video Wave projects to work correctly. First, 8.0 would not display any text added on the overlay line. When I double-clicked the overlay, I could not edit the text, which was invisible. Also, the ""pan and scan"" that replaced the ""motion pictures"" edit was a huge disappointment. Even in advanced mode, Roxio seems to have simplified the process so that it actually does less than it did before: you cannot conveniently adjust the slide duration here, you cannot zoom in as far as before; and the pre-set ""start"" and ""end"" points are quirky to override and the scan point settings sometimes seem to have a mind of their own. I loved it the way the ""edit motion pictures"" function was before and was hoping that in the new release that you'd be able to ROTATE the panning frame as well. What I didn't expect was a dumbed-down version of what worked so well before. Maybe I ought to go pro."
4,Fun for the family,This is a great book for littlies and big kids alike. I love reading to children and this book is so much fun I felt I needed it for my home collection. Enjoy!Cows in the Kitchen
5,"Well, it IS Amazon","If they had bad service they wouldn't be one of the largest internet stores around, would they?"
2,Don't believe the hype...,"After reading the reviews and hearing the buzz about The Aristocrats, I was anxious to see it. I appreciate a good dirty joke as much as anyone and am not easily offended. But this movie STINKS!!! The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of Larry Storch's brief interpretation of the joke using a British accent, which was the only truly funny part of the film and even that part was cut short. The joke itself is not funny. With very few exceptions, the comedians' interpretation of the joke is not funny. It's 90 minutes of self indulgent comedians cracking themselves up over something that is really not all that amusing."
1,People think THIS is FUNNY????,"I had to check out this film on the recommendation of a close friend. He enjoyed it, and it sounded like a clever idea for a film/documentary. I love offensive humor. I also like it when it's delivered in a funny, or clever way. This movie is about as funny as watching your lover get a colonoscopy from the rear. I didn't laugh a SINGLE time, and I'm not that hard to please when it comes to comedies. Simply a LONG movie about a joke (or lack there of) that isn't funny. Waste of money! UNRECOMMENDED!"
1,Don't Bother,"It's not really that this movie is so bad ... it's bad alright, but it's really more boring than bad.Do the comedians use foul language? Yep. Do they say obscene and dirty things? Yep. Do they say basically the same dirty things over and over for way too long? Yep.And ... so what? If you're older than 11 or so, you've heard all these words before and if you're older than, say, 21, you probably aren't the least bit shocked nor are you particularly amused by scatology (ie., bathroom ""humor"").If you're amused by the sight of adolescent boys teaching each other obscenties by using them over and over with each other, then you'll love this movie. Otherwise you really must have better things to do with your time than to sit through it.The fact that I went to an early showing in New York just shows the power of marketing (the New York Times, no less, reviewed it favorably on the front page); the fact that I am writing this review reflects how mad I am at myself for falling for it."
2,a movie that is not rated but still warned im just trying to put something in there,this is for any celebrity who likes hearing the same joke but whitc there isnt very anything to actually want tosee this movie for the actors in this movie dont try to make dirty jokes but the people who made this movie arent trying as hard this film is about art and the things that they make fun of this movie is trying to make people board
2,this great but sometimes stupid,they getgood comedians todo this but they just kept ontrying toffend viewers when i saw this i nearly knew this would be a kind of film that would try and offend and make you laugh but it didnt nearly you would try and make a better movie about whos saying the joke like people like who are better to do a dumb worthless comedy like this that isnt even funny or offensive there were some funny parts but it still would please you to pay for a movie like this now here the other dumb reviews
1,heres amovie you wanta see,people inthis documentary have to be so rude and gross with there humor will any rebview you wonna know they are wrong if peole want to see this the they should not because this a waste of money and time it wont have the kind of stuff you heard about like this movie is really disgusting but its not its just bores people on a joke that doesent act like a joke just people tring to be slang and crude and dumb but they arent there acting like idiots starring inthis aand so dos paul provenza and gilbert gottfried buit this shows a different kind of scene from south park tghat will probably be the funniest thing in the movie for any of you that are a big fanof south p[ark but not then thats the only scene youll like in the movie because of how much that they are just trying to do there same joke whitch they are simmilar but also bad and intriging
4,"Very Nasty, Worth Every Penny","The packaging leaves alot to be desired. Whatever you think is your limit, this movie will push it. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN!!"
1,Refund Please,"I borrowed this DVD from the library, but I still demand a refund in some way. Someone owes me 20 minutes of my life back, as that is all I could stand. The only thing I found offensive was how boring and unfunny it was."
2,Filthy,"I'm no prude, but I reached my limit of the filth of the various tellings of ""The Aristocrats"" about 20 minutes into the film. Frankly, I reached my limit of the entire premise by that point. This would have been much better as a half-hour special on HBO because beyond that, it's too repetitive.The highlight of ""The Aristocrats"" is Kevin Pollak's telling of the joke--as Christopher Walken. One thing the film will show you: there are a lot of professional comedians out there who are really not funny."
3,"Funny, but 90 minutes of it is a bit of a yawn.","There are several great deliveries of the Arisocrats joke in this movie, and you get some truly insightful takes on the craft of the stand-up comedian. After awhile, though, there is only so much momentum that the one joke can sustain. The viewer becomes immune to the intended shock value, and a lot of the comics' schticks become predictable. You get the feeling that you are in a college dorm with a bunch of drunk or stoned guys trying to outdo each other, and it gets a bit tiresome.On the other hand, parts are hysterically funny. This is worth seeing, particularly for the Mime, Segat, the South Park Sequence, Whoopi Golderg, Sarah Silverman, and a few others. Avoid it if you have delicate sensibilities. It's testosterone driven ( even when women are performing), scatalogical, crude humor and it pushes all kinds of politically incorrect buttons."
4,Oh My,"Vile and vulgar are understatements, but I laughed nonetheless. Do not see this movie if you are easily offended. My favorite scenes were Mario Cantone's imitation of Liza doing the joke (hilarious), and George Carlin's version. Really, stay away if you can't handle a truly filthy joke."
5,Not for the prudish,"If you can get over the language & crudeness this is a brilliant study of the comic mind. Having lived with 2 comedians, this was a great insight for me. Comedians of almost all stripes are included.If you bought it & didn't like it all I can say is - who buys before renting anymore, not me. Remember I lived with comedians, I can't afford it."
2,A L-O-N-G journey for a few laughs,"Yes, the increasing vulgarity and bawdiness is funny at times as it culminates in Gottfried's telling of the joke. But an hour and a half of this is just a waste of time. It is amazing that anyone would devote an entire documentary to this. You get the impression that a lot of these comedians are given screen time in order to satisfy their egos because many of them aren't funny and many of them repeat each other. Did I laugh? Three times. Was I ready to eject the dvd during the movie? Yes, two times; it was getting to be boring. This should have been a comedy short - twenty minutes or so. That is all it deserves."
1,What a stupid movie,Don't waste your money or your time. This was one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. Do yourself a favor and buy a FUNNY movie.
2,And The Problem is...,"The joke itself, which the movie is about, is unfortunately, not funny. And maybe that IS the joke."
2,"""Not Star Trek"" was a fun flick.","I enjoyed watching ""Not Star Trek"". The story didn't make much sense, but who cares. ""Not Star Trek"" is still an ""ACTION-PACKED ROLLERCOASTER RIDE"". Lots of shaky cam, things blowing up and don't forget Spock's homemade strawberry Jell-O.Antonio Banderas needs to play Con in the next installment of the FRANCHISE!!"
3,Makes you miss Capt. Kirk,"Good story line, but, without original crew. Scotty will be missed 4ever! He can never be replaced in my opinion. Was glad to see Lenord Nimoy playing his father. Live long and prosper!"
3,Pseudo Star Trek,"Wow. Does the Star Trek franchise have a problem with moving the storyline forward? I appreciate the prequel of Enterprise, but this? I understand this movie was made to draw in a younger crowd but, to me, this takes everthing us older Trekkies have appreciated over the years and rendered it mute. I agree with the comment that this is space action with the Star Trek name slapped on it. My only hope is that they might get the alternate time-line restored in the next movie (heaven forbid we have two Spocks running around!)."
3,Misdirection,"When you buy a Blu Ray Hi Def movie you really don't expect the Director to shake the camera and create camera glare with flashlights to make it look like an old 8mm home film with an hand-held camera. The story was enjoyable, but direction was shakey and annoying. Message to young directors: Take a lesson from Clint Eastwood."
4,Great movie,"Well acted. I'm usually not a fan of prequels, but this one was well done. I've watched it several times already."
5,Excelent movie even for a non-Trekkie,Saw this in the theater and even my wife loved it. The casting while fresh is very complimentary to the original cast. I watched it twice the day I got it and then we had a viewing party to look for R2D2 in the film (He's in there just don't blink or you'll miss him). I like having the option of downloading a digital copy for my portable video player and the extras are nice as well.
5,Great Twist on Star Trek,"This movie was excellent for so many reasons. It takes the original Star Trek universe and changes its history thus creating a whole new dimension for the characters to exist in. If your a Star Trek fan then you want to see and own this movie.Can't wait to see what they do in the next ST... will they base it on ""Wrath of Khan""? I sure hope so!!!"
2,Just a film for teenagers ... as Twilight,"The production effects are good, but the rest is weak ... actors, direction. I saw it in DVD and in Blu-ray. Like I said, a film to teenagers !!! Something like Twilight !!!"
5,Just excellent...,Wow. I happen to like J.J. Abrams direction of this movie (although he seems to have his critics). Very well done in my opinion and an excellent addition to the family!
5,Star Trek,I liked this original pre star trek edition. The special effects while not 'spectacular' were still great and as always Kirk gets the ladies. The romance between early Spock and Lt. Uhura was also a nice touch to this fast action movie.
4,Star Trek 2009,I enjoyed this movie. Simple as that. Anyone that watched the original series and has seen most the previous movies will appreciate all the call-backs from this installation of trek. The back story for Kirk is just meh. And Kirk running into Spock Prime is just ridiculous. All in all a good action sci-fi moving picture.
5,As advertised!,The digital copy was what I was looking to get my hands on and I was not disappointed. Everything worked as advertised. It's an excellent movie.
5,Star Trek Fan,"I am old enough to have seen TOS when it ran on NBC in the late 60's. I have followed all the subsequent TV series and the movies. This is another excellent chapter in the saga, and allows a new story line to develop with new actors, and personally I cannot wait for the next movie. This gets two thumbs up from me."
5,One of the best,"I have never been a Huge fan of Star Trek. I did like the Next Generation movies. I went to the movies to see this movie and this version is good for anyone, fan or not. I highly recommend this movie for any collection."
1,"Fantastic movie, Choppy Video experience, not in HD like I ordered","I ordered this movie in ""HD"" off my Roku XD box on a cable connection which is considered ""high-speed"". About 1 hour into the movie, the connection basically stopped, the video became choppy, and basically unwatchable. Ruined the date and movie night.It also was not in HD after the first hour and was in what seemed like a poor video resolution as it definitely wasn't clear. More than once, it blacked out and said it was ""loading"".The movie is fantastic, but the poor performance of the network or the delivery mechanism through Roku ruined the experience."
2,STICKEM'UP,"Attention Universe: This is the layman (normal,regular guy-expects what he paid for ).As a long time STAR TREK fan I thought this movie would ENTERTAIN its paying audience.Having purchased the BLU-RAY disc and viewing it on my BD player, a great disappointment unveiled. ALL logic has been pushed to the wayside. It was like watching a two hour SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE spoof. Once the cobweb / crustacean-like Romulan Spaceship exited the (wormhole?), things just went south. No need to elaborate(see review by GURMAN SINGH BAL), too bad I can't get my money back.As for Blu-y Quality, it gets 2 stars. If you really want a Blu-ray reference, see the BD versions 'ZULU' (Michael Caine) and ""HOW THE WEST WAS WON"" (ensemble cast). I gave the BD Transfers on these two movies 5 stars and so did all the other reviewers. I got what I PAID FOR!"
2,"Fun movie, annoying product","I enjoyed the movie when I saw it in the theater. Sure it has some things that jarred me out of my engrossed stupor, but it was a good movie. The reason for the low rating is based on the product. I'm not even remotely interested in two extra disks of stuff I'll never watch. And there is no Star Trek blur ray single disk option listed anywhere I can find. I hope decision makers for producing these products read plenty of comments like this one. A cheaper single disk product is what some of us prefer."
2,Terrible story offsets great cast,"What is it when J.J. Abrahms has a great cast he saddles them with a terrible script. He had Phillip Seymour Hoffman in Mission Impossible 3 and that movie was terrible and PSH's awesome acting couldn't save the film. It is the same thing with Star Trek. Let's never mind that it destroys Vulcan, something totally out of sync with everything else in Star Trek, but he makes the characters almost cartoonish in how they act.All of this great acting talent almost overcomes one of the worst scripts of the past five years but it fails because the script runs like a roller coaster from point to point and there is no point to any of it. Spock's father, a major figure in his own right, is like a fly on the wall. It is really just such a shame that all this talent was wasted and what could have been a great movie is very, very weak."
4,"Big JJ Abrams fun, but this film setup for the next one","It's a good action flick with use of special effects nicely woven in. I think Chris Pine isn't my favorite choice. He comes off a someone Michael Bay would cast. Female roles were great, passed the Bechdel test.I felt that when it was 20 minutes left of the movie, that the movie was halfway done. It could have been longer with more action."
5,Love this movie!,"The wife loves Star Trek and this one is no different. Love all the extras on this 3 disc edition. Bought it used and in excellent condition, saved alot of money. Only negative I see is one particular curse word one time in the movie that I hate-gd."
5,StarBlazening,OOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH this was GOOOOOD!!!!! Just about the best one of them all!!!! Can I have more????
3,Overated,"Is this a good film? Yes, but it is nowhere near as exciting or interesting as you might have heard. The main appeal here is the visuals and the terrific cast. The story is muddled and flat, plus the villian is rather one note and cartoonish."
1,Poor script with poor editing,"I'm a long time fan of all the Star Trek series and movies and this one just didn't cut it. Too Manny impossible coincidences, flawed premise and script. Patched together scenes that flowed poorly and many seemed cartoonish. Had many good scenes and good actors but a failure overall."
5,Star Trek,"All trekies/trekers must have this movie in their collection. The love triangle between Spock, Kirk and Uhura continue; yes, this triangle existed in the original tv series! Real trekies won't be upset about this."
5,ESPETACULAR !!!!,"Despite some week points on the history, this is an wonderful movie and this 3 disc version go deep on the Star Trek universe, and it is a must have item for every movie collection.The extras worth it. Image is outstanding, one of the best I ever saw and the same for the sound. I have watched several times, and still like it very much every time. The actors were just perfect and the dialogs memorable. J J Abrams did a very good job, and in my opnion the history is even better than Avatar. I don't know why it did not get, at least, more Oscar indications, maybe it was just prejudice...Buy this Blu-Ray, you won't regret."
2,"Beware, replica falls apart","I ordered this set back in November. I didn't open it until the beginning of March because I didn't have a Blu-ray player until then. I was excited to crack the box open and proudly display the replica of the Enterprise on my desk, but as soon as I pulled it out of the styrofoam packaging, one of the warp engine nacelles just fell off. My bad for not opening it sooner, but now Amazon does not have any of these left to replace it and I'm left with a ship without an engine. Poor quality control here folks!! The Blu-ray is awesome, however, so don't waste your money on this set, just buy the Blu-ray and wait until better models are available (which I hope is someday soon)."
3,No Special Features included,"I had previously purchased this item on DVD when it was first available and then recently decided to get it on Blu Ray now that I have a newer TV and a new Blu Ray player.The reviews for this item stated about all the great extras and special features that were included.I ordered it and went to watch it. To my dismay the only extra was the commentary and an option for BD-Live.Maybe I didn't do enough research, but when the second or third prominent review lists all these great extras, one thinks that they are getting the works.I personally think that review should be moved to the delux edition listing so as not to confuse others."
3,Disappointed,I love the movie. The background music was good. But the speaking sounded very distant; not just quiet. I was very disappointed with that. It downloaded easy enough.
3,To boldly go again,"J. J. Abrams's reboot of the Star Trek franchise is great entertainment. It's a by-the-book blockbuster that ticks all the usual boxes but doesn't deliver anything unexpected or leave much of a lasting impression. But that's fine because that's what blockbusters are all about. It's a shame, however, that the storyline is a tad formulaic. The cast are uniformly good, and manage to portray the familiar characters convincingly. Overall it's a good, solid couple of hours of fun. 3.5/5."
3,One of the best star trek,"When I saw this movie months ago, I though, It definitely will become one of my collection, but with the price of $39.99, Well I think, I have to wait longer before the price going down.Just do not understand, why the studio have to release the pricey three discs + Digital copy version, A lot of buyers would be more than happy just to have the movie only disc without have to pay more."
3,Star Trek [Blu-ray],"The movie itself was spectacular in Blu-ray (I had rented the standard DVD before I got a Blu-ray player). I was VERY disappointed that the only extra was the director's commentary, especially when he referred to all the deleted scenes that ""would be on the DVD."" I haven't bought a lot of DVDs lately and didn't think to see if there was a deluxe edition. It would have been helpful if the deluxe edition had popped up when I was looking at the item, or had been listed with the ""people who bought/liked this item also bought X"". I would have bought the deluxe edition instead of this one, but since I've already spent $20 on this and can't return it as there's nothing wrong with it I am reluctant to spend another $40 to get a second DVD of the movie just to get the extras. Obviously I have learned a lesson, but I am disappointed."
2,"enjoyable movie, problems with Amazon streaming","Enjoyed this movie. It was our first (and so far, only) streaming video rental from Amazon. We have a 10mbs FIOS connection so we should have been able to stream the HD version of this movie (which we paid extra for). However, the stream rebuffered and we had to watch in lower quality. My advice, stick with Netflix. HD streaming is no substitute for Blu Ray."
3,Its Ok.,Typical of hollywood in these times. Special effects and mediocre acting. Once again it is shown that you cannot remake a legendary IP. When will hollywood do something original? If you are a collector and its the only one missing from your collection then buy it if you must and watch it if you dare. This one was most certainly not made for Star Trek fans.
5,A terrific popcorn adventure and a spectacular home theater showcase,"Hardcore Trek fans may balk at the plot-lite action-heavy nature of this latest outing, but for anyone looking for a fun, humor and action-packed movie evening with friends and popcorn, this is highly recommended. And the blu-ray is a wonderful showcase for your home theater system - the visuals are crisp and colorful and the sound will have your neighbors quaking in fear. There are a lot of extras exclusive to the blu-ray release, so if you own a blu-ray player there is no reason you shouldn't be adding this film to your collection."
4,Good one,Excellent restart for a very good series. The kind of entertainment that one hopes for in the sci fi realm.
3,Star Trek Movie and Enterprise Replica,"I like the movie, and have seen it a few times already. The Enterprise replica is all metal as described. The ship is a bit small, but well detailed on the chrome stand. However, as said by others, the packaging and certificate is a bit cheesy. Nothing special about the box to keep or even display the Enterprise, and the certificate isn't numbered, so there can be more than 5000 sets out there.I'd rate it another star if the packaging was better, the ship was bigger, or the price was lower. So the question is: would you spend another $70+ for a metal Enterprise replica??"
3,"Better than I expected, because JJ sucks","Abrahms is a poo-flinging monkey hack of a writer that has screwed up every idea his crack addled ADD brain has ever discharged, and I love Trek. So I really expected to hate this movie. I didn't.If you read the one star reviews you'll get a sense of all of the plot holes that could have been avoided if JJ bothered to watch some Star Trek or sucked less. They are real and it's a shame there are so many of them.But the movie, despite it's faults, is not just watchable but fun. The characters should not be meeting the way they do, but every one of them is cast well and does a great job and are pretty consistent with the old Trek cast. The action is great, the way they are gathered around finalizing the assault on the Romulan mining ship and then execute is, it works. I came away not just satisfied but thinking it was in the top 4 of the movie series. Upon second watch I still think it's fun but there's too many inconsistencies. Maybe top 6."
4,Star Trel (2009),Many aspects of the Star Trek lore have been followed but i do not like the relationship of Spoke and Uhura. it doesn't fit the character.
1,Non-stop action that's a big yawn,"I wanted to like this movie. I was open to the concept. But this movie just dragged on and on.Like the Star Wars prequels, the most fun is just identifying characters and drawing connections to the Original Series characters and events we know and love. On its own, though, it's just not much of a story.What the movie lacks is heart. The surface plot doesn't suffice. The only character that makes any sense is the bad guy who's flying some big ship that looks like what the Babylon 5 shadows would fly if they had giant battle cruisers.Look, if you're going to mash up Star Trek, at least make it fun! Give us something to sink our teeth into. This cotton candy grows stale a good hour before final credits.Side note: Zachary Quinto did a pretty good job at capturing Spock's body language, but the voice was all Syler. That was distracting. I kept expecting him to point his finger at someone's forehead and...."
2,Great Effects. Poor Story.,"Undeniably, great special effects. Unfortunately not sufficient to make a good movie. The story line is poor, linear, and barely compares to the Star Trek universe. This version is more like space cowboys. I am a The Next Generation fan. In TNG, Captain Picard is constantly faced with situations that require a discerning and strategic approach, combining smarts, negotiation, creativity, tactical maneuvers, not just the boring ""let's blow them up with a bunch of proton torpidos"". Zachari Quinto (Spock) is the only excellent actor in this mascarade."
2,Lens flares and crappy sets + wasted potential,"While the movie had a lot of cool CGI, the sets and locations were pathetic. A brewery with computer desks lined up by the vats? I admit it was hard to see with the flares though. The actors did a fair job but the plot was unsophisticated and clumsy. Adding stupid twists to the well established Star Trek universe added up to a parody. This is not an acceptable work to add to the original vision. This is a low rent version that has none of the class of other Star Trek movies. It's really a shame this movie was made."
5,great flick....nice to be able to view it at home.,"really enjoyed when seen in the theater, but nicer to be able to really see, hear, stop and enjoy some scenes in more detail."
5,Not a Star Trek fan but..,Really enjoyed this movie. Will watch it over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
1,Sock Em Boppers,"these toys are so much fun, and the injuries are very minor. i have a sock'em boppers tourey with my friends and we have only suffered 4 concussions from the fights in almost 5 weeks. the best part is when they pop and instead of punching them with an air filled fist, you actually hit them very hard. the next best part is when the seams break open and start hissing out air every time a blow is dealt. along with the minor injuries come broken noses, open head wounds, and even fractured ribs. so far, there has been 18 people who have gotten the wind knocked out of them. although these injuries sound severe, they are all worth it when you beat the crap out of your best friends, and they wake up a week later with no memory of it. i love them."
1,Terrible,It poped in the first 5minutes but those five minutes were fun But it doesn't last it should be like five dollars
2,Prone to Breaking,"I should have suspected that these bands may break fairly easily due to their inexpensive price. I purchased them for the P90X workout, and during the first workout I broke both the handles off the second heaviest band doing exercises they show on the box. (Standing on one end of the cord while pulling the handle for a tricep workout). Once the handles broke off I do still actually use the bands themselves for the workouts, not near as comfortable...but still has decent resistance. During our second workout the handles broke off the red heavier duty bands as well. I sent an e-mail to Valeo directly to see if they would send a replacement but I never got an e-mail back."
5,Excellent book,"This is a very informative commentary, it is thorough and very satisfying, i was very surprised with the quality information provided along with hebrew words and their meanings.Wonderful book for all bible students."
2,"too simple, poorly organized","I've read the book cover to cover, but I can't say that it gave me any cooking ideas I didn't already have. Also, the recipes are simply listed sequentially, without being organized in any meaningful way."
1,not pleased,This book is great if you want to buy unscented soaps and add oils to scent them but no information on truly createing your own formulas.
3,"Brian, Brian, and more Brian",A nice quick read. Gives you enough facts to keep you interested but not a lot to overwhelm you. The quotes section has some of Brian's best remarks (they're extremely funny!)A good book for fans his fans who are interested in knowing more about him or who would like to read about the formation of the band in chronological order.
3,Useful but flawed,"The authors of this book obviously conducted a lot of research and cared a great deal about their subject. As other reviewers have said, it does contain a lot of useful information for someone thinking about retiring to Islands. Unfortunately, however, the book suffers greatly from two serious flaws. First, it is incredibly poorly proofread; it is replete with distracting and annoying spelling and typographical errors. (One wonders what the publisher was doing!) Second, large portions of the book provide information about matters that change very quickly. In particular, the prices cited are already wildly out of date. I think it would be great if the authors, perhaps with some help from an editor, updated the information and cleaned up the text."
5,"Amazing - Focus, ask, read, and learn","This is truly a feat of man and nature. We have found a way to query and hear from the same underlying forces of nature that influence our lives. Thus, giving us invaluable insight to the significant issues in our lives."
1,"Could be good, but unfortunately isn't","This film is one of those films that you watch and continue hoping to the last minute that it will get good, because throughout the film there are good moments, but in the end it is sadly, a flop. Danny Aiello is a good actor, so he makes his scenes believable,as does ann archer, but Angelina Jolie seems to be reading the lines right out of a script. A big flaw in this film is that throughout the movie it appears as if the characters are insane and crazy, only in the last few scenes all characters seem to suddenly turn boring and normal. This movie is not to be recommended. However if you do like this film or if you like the sort of mystical style, I recommend ""Arizona Dream"" which has similar qualities and in my opinion, is very good."
3,A differant kind of Movie,"It is a little hard to follow has almost no story line and all but wierd, but it kept me glued to see what was going to hapoen Next, And Besides it has Angelina Jolie it."
3,entertaining,You can read it and takes you till the end.Wondering how the others books would be? anyway was an entertaining experience.
2,Old-Fashioned? Only in the title,This was a bad cookbook. There are very few pictures or helpful hints and the lay-out just looked like someone threw together a bunch of different recipes. There are no references as to where the recipes were obtained and many seemed like modern spin-offs rather than actually old-fashioned-like Salad Dressing Cake and Tuna-Potato Chip Casserole. There was no way to know what the recipe would taste or look like from the book and some sounded awful like Anchovy Pecans and Stuffed Prune Salad.
2,"It does work, but it's as annoying any Microsoft product","It is pretty amazing that you can turn your PC into a competent GPS. You can also cut and paste addresses into it.It does not work as well as the Garmin dashboard units. If I want to find the nearest Peet's Coffee; S&T; can't do it. It can show me dozens of ""restaurants - other"" in my area (oddly excluding what I'm looking for). If I search for Peet's it finds only 6 of the many dozens of Peets stores.It has a category for grocery stores and for shopping centers, but not for hardware or office supply stores.I had S&T; 2006 and the GPS broke. I bought the 2008 thinking they'd have improved it. I can't see any improvement; it looks exactly the same and has the same odd little deficiencies.My father-in-law has a great little Garmin unit. I was a fool and tried to save money getting S&T;."
2,Not much different,"For anyone that does not have S&T; with GPS it is a GREAT program. I travel to multiple clients each day and the program does a great job of mapping out the trip for me. Dropping all the client addresses into the program couldn't be easier.I have used S&T; 2006 for over a year and thought it was time to pick up the latest version. For those of you thinking of upgrading to 2008, I have found that there is not much to see here. Other than a new perspective map view, and the auto-calculate new route, the program operates and functions the same as 2006. Maybe it has more ""points of interest"" than 2006, but I really don't care; I'm on the road to see clients, not to find a coffee shop. If you are using 2006, or 2007, stay with what you have."
1,can't update,"too bad you can't update the maps. that, and the availability of google maps makes this just not worth anything"
1,Old Version No Longer Supported By Microsoft,"I bought a copy of 2008 Streets & Trips with receiver. A couple months later the program crashed and wouldn't reboot. After several uninstall/reinstall attempts I began to search the web for a solution and found that many people have this same problem. The only solution was to call Microsoft support and have them fix it. When I called today, they told me the product was no longer supported as of October 2010 and they couldn't help me. My feeling is Microsoft shouldn't stop support on a product if it has a fatal flaw with one of it's own operating systems, unless they are going to pull it off the shelves.Love the features + GPS when it's worked. I suggest buying 2009."
2,Not that good!,"When in the city, it will be a little to slow to provide anticipation for turns... Slow to redirect you to the correct address... sometimes it gets disconnected for no good reason... in the countryside it works well."
1,"good shipping, poor product...","great shipping.But, GPS is not good... the voice instruction was confused, and direction by GPS was too late many times. my old navi on my car (2004) is much better."
1,Campground POI's shown incorrectly,RV Park and campground POI's are shown incorrectly to the SE (as much as 30 miles) from where they should be. Also many Canadian campgrounds are missing all together. The sites that I tested show up correctly on the older 2006 version.
2,map is not up to date,the map section is old need to update the map.need to list what date the map was printed.The new printed maps are up to date.
4,The best Adam Sandler movie I've seen!,My husband and I were chuckling through the entire movie. Adam Sandler was truly funny (rather than just acting stupid) in this movie. Great screen writing. Highly recommend. Too bad there were a few mild curse words or else I would have let my 6 year old watch.
1,Simply a bad movie.,"Mr. Deeds is, quite simply, an awful movie. Sandler has done some funny stuff in his career and some really bad stuff in his career. This movie is near the top of the 'bad stuff' list. It's no secret that Sandler is not an actor so because of that, I would expect a very funny script to help make up for that fact. There is hardly anything funny in the movie. Even his high-powered co-stars can't save this one. I wouldn't recommend anyone rent this movie, let alone pay money to own it."
1,About as charming as a toothache,"So I guess Sandler bought the rights to Capra's classic and immediately cast himself in the starring role. First big mistake. Sandler is as winning a protagonist as Weird Al would be in ""It's a Wonderful Life."" He's no Gary Cooper. I wonder if he even watched the original.And no, Winona is no Jean Arthur.The original depression-era rags-to-riches classic is here reduced to an annoying ""I'll show you"" vehicle to make Sandler's fans cheer but the rest of us to ask, ""What were they thinking?"""
3,"Watchable Adam Sandler film, but not a keeper","This is kind of a by-the-numbers Capra tale, but lacking a sense of script sophistication that could have made it better. The script plays like a good first draft that has yet to be touched up with better touches of pacing.The actors do a fine enough job, but the dialogue sounds like it was written from a crib-noted version of a Beginning Screenwriting course.The weakest script and movie moments occur in the hero's small, idyllic New Hampshire hometown. The offbeat locals are a bit TOO offbeat and seem to be written as walking punchlines, though they just aren't all that funny.Sandler's character seems to move from situation to situation because the script and plot conveniently call for it, but not because there is a logical through-line in the script itself.This is a sometimes pleasant comedy that never really offends viewers but never really rewards them with anything original or too intelligent either."
1,It's a Snore,"Sandler's movies are hit and miss, and this was definately a miss(although not as deplorable as Happy Gilmore or Little Nicki). Sandler plays his simpleton roll by walking around as if he's half asleep and completely disinterested in everything around him. Winona Ryder's performance is actually painful to watch and you have a sense through the entire movie that SOMEONE, ANYONE else would have been better in the part. The only redeeming performance comes from John Turturro who plays the butler with the odd foot fetish with character and charm. Don't even waste a rental fee on this one!"
1,didn't get too far,"To be fair, I am not an Adam Sandler fan anyway, but my kids wanted to watch this. All of us decided to turn it off shortly after it started because it didn't seem worth the effort. It was boring and unfunny."
4,All Adam Sandler movies are the same. Except Punch Drunk Love,"A ll Adam Sandler movies are the same. They are all funny, but predictable. A dumb, but lovable character falls in love with girl that is way out of his league. She almost bails on him, but eventually comes around. During all that semi serious drama hilarity ensues. This movie is exactly the way I just described. This time John Turturo is the highlight. He really steals the show in this movie. This movie is worth watching just to see his character, Emilio. Mr. Deeds is a classic comedy everyone needs to see."
3,Silly,"Adam Sandler is charming at times, like he usually is, but the original is much better.At least it isn't as offensive as Little Nicky!"
1,pieces are not wooden,"unlike what it says in the description, the pieces are not wooden, they are plastic. I bought this chess set because I thought that it would all be made of wood."
2,Disappointed,"We have just opened and viewed the videos of Babylon 5 - Epsilon Chronicles and are greatly disappointed in the quality of the tapes. Having subscribed earlier to the Columbia House versions of Babylon 5, the quality of these videos leaves a lot to be desired. They appear to have been dubbed on a less that optimum vcr. The subject matter is tremendous and the ability to select which sets to purchase is five star, however, I wish they had been first run quality. I will continue to view them for I am a five-star Babylon 5 fan. Be prepared to be disappointed."
1,Give credit where it's due.,"The Berlin speech. The wall was already coming down whenReagon said""tear down that wall"" The Pope was very instrumental in this , but got no credit."
5,Beautiful Book!,"I needed pictures to help me figure out how to design a Country Western style art gallery. This book had beautiful pictures, gives an overview of the history of the western culture, and provides names of companies and/or creators of furniture pieces. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes the Rustic/Country Western style home; this book was absolutely wonderful!"
3,Short and concise,"Because it's written by an MD and written for parents plus professionals, you'll find alittle bit better advice than most sources. Chapters cover general information, causes,""looks like ADD but isn't"", learning disabilities, perceptual motor difficulties, mood,evaluating ADD children, treatment, drugs, and management techniques. Its short andconcise. You won't waste a lot of time reading through tech stuff OR fluff stuff."
3,The doggy dictionary,This book is a great resource if you're keen to learn all about the inner goings on of your jack russell. An insightful book that is witty and interesting find out not only why your pooch behaves like he does but how to prevent him from becoming the puppy from hell - amicably.Cheap pet therapy!
4,Robbie goes Rock,"This is a much more rock-influenced CD than Robbie's previous work. That said, fans of sophisticated pop will also love this CD. The first 10 songs on the album are accessible to new Robbie Williams fans, while the remaining songs fall back on his more eclectic, tongue-in-cheek, British style and might take several listens before becoming palatable. ""Me and My Monkey"" is the low point of the album. ""Feel"", ""Sexed Up"", and ""Love Somebody"" are particularly strong tracks."
4,A Well Rounded and Diversified Collection,"Mr. Williams has come of age with Escapology. Robbie has proven that a member of a Boy Band can grow mature and nurture. Escapology is a well rounded diverse collection of Pop Songs that are deep with feeling and broad with scope.Take a dash of Journey, add a hint of Dave Matthews and sprinkle with just a touch of Garth Brooks. Couple this with Robbie's strong unique voice and surely you finally have an excellent Pop Album that even the American Public will find palitable.This is a quality collection that deserves to be heard - especially by Justin Timberlake who's recent work pales by comparrison."
2,Not his best album,"In comparison to his other albums, escapology is truly not his best album. I am disapointed that I actually wasted my money buying this album, its a complete waste. These songs are nothing compared to the songs -Supreme,Millenium,Let love be your energy.So if you are a big fan of robbie, go ahead buy it but keep the bill ready cause you are gona exchange it."
4,Robbie is my hero,"I bought this album last fall through the Amazon UK site (for about double the price). I think it is such a shame that Robbie hasn't been more accepted by the American public. If you are a Robbie fan, I am sure you will add this one to your collection.""Feel"" is the first single, but I love the song ""Sexxed Up"". Revolution, Monsoon, Nan's Song, the list of great songs goes on. Hopefully people will see the humor in Robbie's songs such as ""Me and My Monkey"" and ""Handsome Man"".If you haven't listened to Robbie yet, check this and some of his earlier albums out."
2,Disappointed Fan,"I couldn't be a bigger fan of Robbie Williams, but this CD was a big let down. First of all, be warned, its full of bad language. My 13 year old son is also a fan and I won't let him listen to this one. Secondly, this is mostly Robbie bragging about himself and his prowess. He just signed a big contract and I think his head is about to explode. He also puts down his fans saying, basically, that he is just using them for what he can get. The melodies are nothing new either. The two stars are for 'Feel' which is a decent, thoughtful song. Sorry, but most people can't relate to the rantings of a British pop star."
1,Just say NO to cheating record companies,"I urge you all to refuse to buy discs like this one that are not proper CDs, but abuse the CD name to sell you something that cannot be played on many CD players.Just say No to cheating record companies!"
3,Listen to Kim hughes,"I love robbie williams and what he does, he not frank about what he hear for and I enjoy him.Listen to the online editors review by Kim hughes. I miss her comments here in Toronto. He on air voice, and attitude she brings to the music industry.I'll listen to this one day, but I rather buy Sigur ROS, or Hayden."
4,Best CD in years,I can honestly say this is one of the best cds that I have ever heard in my life. 98% of the songs are excellent and very pleasant to listen to. This is the first time I have bought a cd from robbie williams and am planning to get some of his other stuff. Anyone who likes good pop music should get it.
3,Little Disappointing,"I absolutely love RW. I still don't understand why this man is nowhere to be seen in U.S. television or heard in U.S. radio. But in regards to Escapology, I am honestly a little disappointed. The one thing about ""Ego Has Landed"" and ""Sing When You're Winning"" is that in each CD I find that most songs are really great. But in my opinion, Escapology only has a few great songs (""Feel"", ""Sexed Up"", ""Something Beautiful"", ""Revolution"", and ""Nan's Song""). ""Me and My Monkey"" is really funny, but not his good stuff. I think that the album was produced while he was experiencing an emotional low. In summary, I don't think that this is Robbie's best work, but I think that some great stuff is coming in the future."
1,Poor,"What is it with this guy, each and every album he produces is different to that of the last one. That has probably been the secret of his success in the UK and Europe, but at the age of 27 surely he should have found somekind of diretion.Alas this album highlights that Robbie Williams just follows the latest fads and changes. When I think of the music produced by British artists over the years I think of Radiohead, The Beatles, The Sex Pistols etc bands that actually pushed the boundaries of music. Now all we get is this guy who seems to think that the world revolves around him, without him actually achieving anything.What with the garbage being churned out in the music industry today it is hard to see how this album will fail."
2,Robbie William's Worst,"I think this is the worst CD Robbie Williams has released to date. The music is so unappealing. I bought the CD in Europe and I was particularly irritated by the copy protection that won't let you save the CD in your hard disk (this protection should be illegal in the US, right?)--and by the ... euros I had to shell out. Why it is being sold in the US for $... beats me, but I don't think it's worth it, either."
3,Patty Larkin,"Correction -- the Patty Larkin song isn't called ""Anyway the Main Thing Is,"" it's the title track from her ""Regrooving the Dream"" CD."
3,"The metal ""party"" song is...",Bombshell...by Powerman 5000...and yeah...scores to movies like this are truely good if they offer the soundtrakc as well...gotta maximize your audience..
1,No theme song,"I bought this soundtrack for many reasons, but one of them was to hear the song that is used as the theme for the movie Evolution. The new version ""play that funky music white boy"" is used throughout the movie, in every trailer, and other reference to the movie. I was very disappointed to find this song no where on the album. Don't get me wrong the rest of the music is okay but it doesn't include the movies main song."
4,Intrigue + Interest = this.,"Sara King's style is evident in all of these poems. While there are obvious strong pieces, there are several that should not have been included in this collection.Any description that I could plot down with letters would not equal the range of emotion reached by Sara King's metaphors. Therefore, I will not try. I will urge you, however, to read the ""Laundry"" poem and you will agree with me. (I heard this poem via Garrison's Keillor's Writers Almanac program on NPR.)I will admit that I did not, indeed, purchase a copy of this book--I read the complete text via the Publisher's Web site, but believe me: this is worth buying. I intend to order my copy this week.Allan St. JamesBowling Green, KYAuthor of Banner"
4,A Book About and For Girlfriends!,"Highly entertaining and enjoyable...although I couldn't believe sometimes how gullible Misty could be regarding men even though she was quite competent and professional regarding her career. This is a book that I recommend to others especially reading groups. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll get upset but you'll still want to read this book until the end."
4,"""A funny and entertaining read for women of the '90's!","""I loved the way ""Scenes"" gets into your head and spells out some of the things all women think but, dare not put into written words. I had fun with this book, Misty and Reesy are my friends, co-workers and neighbors. Truly a book for ""sistahs"" of ALL colors. A great read"
3,this book was alright,This book was ok. its not a book that really stands out though i mean i even forgot i read it. but it was a book that was not that bad.
2,Same old stuff,"Haven't I read this book, like, 50 times already? Upwardly mobile Black women with the looks, wit and material goods that any woman would kill for, living in relatively lavish conditions, working jobs that pay ludicrous amounts, but can't quite figure out the whole relationship thing, no? The only thing differentiating this from the other three hundred Black books on the market now just like it is that she opted to only use 2 women instead of the (stereo)typical 4. When I want to read Terri McMillan, I'll pick up ""Waiting to Exhale"". When I want to read a bad take on Terri McMillan, I'll read ""A Day Late.."" When one of the rave reviews for your book is from a strong safety for the Miami Dolphins..."
3,Entertaining,"I read this book in 2 days, and i must say it did not match the hype it produced. However, it had a cute storyline and was an easy read. Very entertaining but alittle too predictable."
5,Familial Bias or Just Good Taste?,"I sat here like a dumb heff. staring at this page of entries for the past two months (of course I took breaks) before it dawned on me that this was interactive. So now that my brain stem has finished fusing together, I am determined to show some love for my sister Lo! Anyone who is considering buying this book, go ahead and take the plunge! Lo is a true talent! Show her some love! Support Black authors! Support female authors! Make sure that she stays on the bestseller lists! After all, how else is she going to afford her packs of braid hair? ;-) Much love, Lo. XOXO"
5,"A Definate Must Read, Great Story","I laughed, I Cried, I got angry and I cheered. This is one of the BEST book I have ever read. In fact I read it in a day and a half and I am ordering the next one. Lolita Files definately got it going on. Keep writing these great books."
4,MOVING,This CD doesn't grab you right away. But after a few times it's hard not listen to it. Very moving CD.
1,Big disappointment,"Ever buy a CD you had high hopes for and when you got it - it became one you quickly decided you would only listen to once? That would be my experience with this. Over-orchestrated, there is nothing subtle about this recording, it is loud and bombastic. Many of my favorites - such as the Lion King pieces -were reworked and changed miserably. I absolutely loved Zimmers' ~ Millennium: Tribal wisdom and the modern world."
4,This should be considered the classic of the Korean War,"This book treats the war as military history, from the power struggle on the penninsula following the end of WWII to the final Armistice. The Korean War is a complicated conflict (you wouldn't know it from watching MASH though) which saw both sides surge north and south, with new belligerents getting involved in the war at different points and with a mix of WWII technology on the ground and Cold War technology in the skies. Max Hastings does an excellent job of putting the conflict together not just in terms of the ""big picture"" but also in the eyes of those who fought it."
4,The First L'Amour Book I ever read,I really enjoyed this book. Tap Duvarney is a good protagonist and the showdown in the thunderstorm storm at the climax is particularly exciting. This is a good starter book for those new to L'Amour!
5,beautiful watch!,"I purchased this watch as a birthday gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it. It is a beautiful watch and a great value for the price. It has a very nice leather band and the is a good size. All the original packaging, etc arrived in tact. I was very impressed and highly recommend this watch for the man in your life!"
5,Gift Basket,"This is the favorite candy of my son, and he is the one who received it. They just loved it."
5,The court of the Crimson King is back!!!!!!!!,"And what a comeback!!!! as a quartet now the Crimsoms are back in bussines to offer to us a Heavy-Progressive album with sublimme instrumental pieces and schizophrenic explosions comming suddenly out of nowhere , this masters of soundscape guitars cut our breath with no need of virtuossism but with innovation, experimentation and instrumental techniques that no other band of this genre or from another genre offer to rock scene, artwork as usual is very characteriztic of this band and is deligthfull for the whole combo of progresive sound and visual concept, great album, great bandHM"
5,The Power is very Powerful,"Mr. Fripp and his team of musicians (Pat Mastelotto - Drums, Trey Gunn - Bass, Adrian Belew - Guitar) are forces to be reckoned with. They are on point for this incredible album. I absolutely love to turn up the volume very high on track 2, ""Level Five"", track 4, ""Elektrik"", and track 7, ""Dangerous Curves"". I like Bill Bruford, but Pat Mastelotto's style is amazingly tight, elusive, strange, Hypnotizing, and uncompromising. Trey Gunn's basses are also on point, using sounds so different from your typical bassist. Adrian Belew's guitar and voice are just as impressive. Robert Fripp's guitar is better than ever. I never get tired of playing this album all the way through."
2,Not very good....for King Crimson!,"This is better than their last CD,but where has the fire gone in the music? The ""songs"" are much better than the forced sounding dismal ones on the last release,""Construction of Light"",but the instruments never ""ignite"" into the passion that is the trademark of the best of Crimson.Are they trying too hard to fit into their new found ""prog-metal"" nich?(Much respect was shown towards KC by a Black/Death Metal fan friend of mine in a recent conversation.)Only Fripp knows.But this Tony Levin /Bill Bruford-less Crimso is a flat firecracker so far,as far as I am concerned!(NO BANG,just one long fuse...!)The Pre-CD EP,""Happy With What..."",kicked this to PIECES!Ah well....I'll hope for better next time."
1,I don't get it!,"I read the reviews, bought the product and really don't understand it's appeal. If you like dry,almost tasteless, light calorie snacks go for it. If you want taste, crunch and some substance get a bag of chips. And, the chips are cheaper too!"
1,Horrible,We bought two of these suitcases (shame on us) because we had previously had great luck with Samsonite. Both of them have broken due to the cheap plastic used in the latches.. We had to haul them 30 miles to get repaired (with the same cheap latches).
4,"Feels good, but can't be secured","I use this pad in one of my kayaks, and so far I like it. It is ""held in place,"" if I can say that, by your body weight and a (mildly) no slip surface on its underside. It has three tiny loops (as pictured), but in my boat, at least, there really isn't any use for the loops. I was worried that it might slide around when I am paddling hard, but that hasn't happened. There isn't any way to adjust the size, so you should measure your kayak seat to see if this pad will work in your boat."
2,"ok, not worth the price","Bought a couple of these to place on hard plastic kayak seats. Our butts would hurt after about 1.5 hours of paddling. After adding the yakpad, our butts hurt after about 2.5 hours of paddling. Not worth the money to me; I expected more."
2,It's ok.....,"This is not the best cd, definitely not the worst. Maybe I haven't put enough time into listening to this cd, but it didn't really capture my attention. It's pretty monotonous. I pretty much listen to it to hear the song about the hooptie that's on one tree hill, and number 6. that's about it. That's a good waste of 13 dollars, if you ask me."
5,From A Tracker!,Hey guys! It's ScottyLsGurl!This is one of my new CD's and I haven't listen'd to anything else in a while! I love it that much I think you will to! If I have to describe Tyler I would describe it as a rock blues soul mix and theres a song in here for everyone!
5,great cd,This is a great cd. i highly recomend that everyone buys one. my favorite tracks on the album would have to be either pink and black or kiss on. Tyler sounds like a mix between ryan cabrera and john mayer. if you like either of those artists you will like tyler. buy the cd and help support tyler hilton.
5,Tyler is great,"Tyler is great his music is so fresh and new and like nothing i have heard before everybody should buy this album his songs Glad and Pink and Black are brilliant. Tyler is just what we have been waiting for. He also features on the One Tree Hill soundtrack and duets with Bethany joy Lenz and they make a fantastic duo.If you like Tyler then join his website at www.tylerhilton.com, Review by Sarah O'Keeffe"
5,one of my absolute favorites,"Tyler Hilton is one of my absolute favorite musicians because I think that he's really real & very grounded. This cd is absolutely amazing, I love how catchy the songs are (his songs are the only ones I don't mind having stuck in my head!) and how meaningful the lyrics are. Fantastic cd."
5,The best singer... ever!,"Tyler hilton's cd is just feel good music. His songs keep me singing for hours and I love turning on this cd and just hanging out. Not only is Tyler's voice perfect on the cd, but he isn't fake; his voice is also perfect in concert too! Buy this cd and you definitly won't be disapointed. Great for ALL ages, guys and girls, just feel good music!*shazaam"
3,Good for the KitchenAid Mixer,"I have the KitchenAid Pink Mixer so I had to get the matching spatula. I only use this Spatula when I am using the mixer. It's the perfect shape and has a good weight. I dont like for cooking, however. The silicon ones from the cooking stores are much better. For baking and using the mixer, this is perfect."
2,"KitchenAid Cook For The Cure Mixer Spatula, Pink",This spatula is too stiff! I gave it to my daughter and stuck with my old one. Not worth the money.
2,Outdated materials,"This is a good basic book, but some of the sources depicted in the book are no longer around! The book is too old and should really be updated with modern suppliers of parts, services, etc. I believe the book is over 2o yrs. old?Ted Mena, Florida"
1,GROTTY,"In general, during press confrences and interviews, the ""fabs"" were usually bored, tired, stupid or oh so very stoned. On this CD they're all of the above."
1,Screw?,"I was really excited for this to give to my boyfriend who is a physics teacher. However, when he tried to put it together, he realized that the screw that was sent with this item doesn't even fit through the hole of the base! And the base is all scratched up! Unfortunately, we are very dissatisfied with this item :("
3,They Missed AGAIN!!,"Sorry, I can't endorse this latest Grace Jones collection because Universal failed to include enough material from the SUPER RARE 'Muse' & 'Fame' albums (BTW, I have both on a single disc!), 'Seven Day Weekend' (fr.'Boomerang' SDTK), 'Slave To The Rhythm' (which is one of Grace's BIGGEST HITS without question!!), and the rare 1978 B-Side to 'Do Or Die' titled 'Comme Un Oiseau Qui S'Envole' (which I'm lucky enough to have on CD!!!) would've been a nice track to include here!!In closing, 'The Grace Jones Story' (VERY OVERPRICED BY THE WAY!!) was supposed to be the FIRST comprehensive collection / anthology for Grace Jones fans, but alas..the record company fu**** up again!! And they wonder why fans insist on making BETTER compilations at home ? Hmmm...NEXT!Peace, SD(of 'Chaka's World')"
4,Great wine rack,"Great wine rack for the price. It has a nice espresso finish looks like a high quality furniture piece. It was not too complicated to put together sturdy and stable once it is tightened correctly. You are are using threaded screws into predrilled wood holes, so take you time and get it right the first time.The packing could be better as the middle shelf had a dent and became seperated in shipping. Otherwise this would have been 5 stars for the price. Amazon replaced it right away with a new shipment, but I did not like the fact that they had to ship a whole complete set rather than just the one piece. I did get the new one in teo days though and just had to remove the damaged piece and have UPS pick it up."
2,flimsy!,"I'm not sure if my husband has, but I have never taken the time to review a product until now- I had to warn other people. I give it two stars instead of one only because it looks nice from far away. But it's misleading; this piece of furniture is SO FLIMSY and cheaply made! We are going to have to nail it into the wall for fear it will fall over. For this price I would expect much higher quality. Shame on this company. Do not buy this!"
2,difficult at best,"I opened the package and checked off all the pieces. I was missing 2 screws but figured I could use some of my own. After putting the right side and back together, I couldn't get the bottom piece of the back to stay in. After 20 minutes of fiddling around, I realized that the side piece was broken. I figured I could glue or drill a screw in to keep it together. I then proceeded to try to put everything together on the bottom half. Two hours and a lot of swearing later, I realized this thing was not going together. I ended up packing it up and sending it back. I'm happy Amazon will refund me the money. I'm very disappointed."
5,wood wine tower,It was nicer looking in person that in the picture. I ended up painting is black semi gloss and it turned out great. It was a house warming gift for our son and he loved it. Would definately recommend it
4,An Important Work,"I acknowledge the importance of this book and on that alone I would like to give it five stars. However, I just did not connect with the book. I tolerated it. It had nothing to do with the subject matter as my mind is as open as anyone's could be. It just seemed to drag on for me for the longest time. I was so happy with the ending because it was finally over with. Well, that, and it did have a happy ending. That was refreshing.The book I had was the audio version. The narrator was very good, but perhaps that had something to do with how I felt about it."
1,T.R.A.S.H,"Urggh!!! This is even worse than the greatest hits of Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Zoso album of Led Zeppelin. AC/DC are simply the most overrated metal band ever. All their albums suck, especiallythis. Touch Too Much has to be one of the lousiest and worst songever recorded by any band. Avoid this bad album and get Metallica Ride the Lightning insted."
1,I'M GLAD BON SCOTT'S DEAD,"AC/DC are one of the most overrated and worst artists ever. And this album is really really bad. And that singer...Bon Scott he'sso angry, why can't he stop screaming and sing properly like Billie Joe Armstrong, or even Mark Knopfler? They rock and they are sure part of the 3 greatest rock bands ever. Each and every song on this album except for that Highway to hell song is awfuleven the horrible TOUCH TOO MUCH. This is just as awful as allthe other AC/DC albums. If you've heard Back In Black and thinkAC/DC's great...then you are an idiot because they suck! Like tosay...this band is just as overrated as Aerosmith and QUEEN!!!!!!Stay away from this awful album.....even if radio's play this album. And one more thing, if Bon Scott was still alive today...they better kill him because of his rusty angry voice.This is noise....all this is is sex drugs violence and liqour.DIRE STRAITS GREEN DAY AND GNR ARE THE BEST."
5,Rockin',I've listened to the original cd and I wanted the remastered version and it is awesome! It really clears up the sound and it blows my mind every time I listen to it. This is a cd to have if you want to hear rock the way ac/dc really made it!
5,uAU !,"I'm not being boring, I love ""Back in Black"" and other AC/DC albuns with Brian Johnson, but, try to be neutral and you'll see, in ""HIGHWAY TO HELL"", that Bon Scott was one-thousand times a better singer than Johnson, both technically and evaluating the charisma between him an AC/DC's style of music. The trouble is that, in this CD, this is clearer than ever! The band is at his peak and I wonder if, had they not written the stupendous material that formed ""BACK IN BLACK"", would Johnson stay in the band for so long."
5,Classic album that sounds awsome!,"I'm not going to waste my time describing this album because I'm pretty sure all AC/DC fans are familiar with it. The thing is that I really don't understand how a reviewer said that this remastered cd sounded bad. The sound is clean and clear. The guitars are more ""alive"" than the original cd version. If you don't own a copy, by all means go buy one. Walmart sells all of the Epic remasters for $9.72. I even saw some of them for $8.64."
4,The best with Bon,Highway to Hell is considered by many to be AC/DC's best work. I agree that it is their best with Bon Scott but not their best overall.AC/DC again explored some bluesey riffs on Walk All Over You and Night Prowler but they had honed the skill since 1976's Dirty Deeds. Don't get me wrong this is a heavy album. One of their heaviest. The songwriting is excellent the Young brothers' guitar work is crisp and clean and Scott's vocals are delivered with his trademark snarl.This is an outstanding album and should be a staple in any hard rock/metal fans collection.
1,Foreigner and Dire Straits are billions better..................,"AC/DC are just as bad as Nirvana. Bon Scott sings so horribly, and just sounds like a dying duck who just screams. The fact is, AC/DC they've only made a single decent song in the title track ""Highway To Hell"". The rest of the other albums and songs are terrible. I'm glad both Kurt Cobain and Bon Scott are DEAD!!! Thankfully they will never annoy me again. For good lovely music, get Foreigner and Dire Straits instedwho were a billion times better than this lousy AC/DC album.Avoid this and Nevermind of Nirvana 2 of the worst albumsever."
5,It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This.,"I remember standing in a record store in some strip mall in Bellevue, Washington, in the late fall of 1979, asking my dad to buy me this record. I was 12 and didn't really know anything about the group; I had just noticed that the title track, Highway to Hell, was number 2 on the charts (or something like that), and I thought I would give them a try. The album blew me away (much to the irritation of my parents, and even my older brother, who thought AC/DC would never be as cool as KISS).For me, AC/DC never got any better than this. Back in Black may have the song everybody knows - You Shook Me All Night Long - but in terms of songwriting, musicianship, and production, Highway to Hell is the ultimate AC/DC disc from first note to last. Every song on this album is great. And this remaster is excellent; the recording sounds new, and appropriately raw as ever.Bon Scott, you will never be forgotten."
1,Good album,This isnt AC/DCs greatest albums but all the songs are great. Its rare that someone likes every song off an album by an artist but who cant like all these songs by a great band. I give this album three stars since its not the best rockin AC/DC album. The best IMO is Let there Be Rock since most of the songs have a bigger guitar sound to them thats what rock is about.
3,Remastered Quaility???????????,"What is the quaility of the REMASTERING???????? Does anyone really need these long winded reviews of old school killer albums? You either like it or you don't. If the album has been remastered, i would be more interested in the quaility of the remastering than of anyones opinion of the albums, as if we have all lived under a rock for the past 30 ys. Three stars because who knows the quailty difference from the original."
2,"Don't believe the hype -- I'm a fan, but this album is weak!","Sorry, I just don't get the hype surrounding this album. Maybe it's because it was Bon's last-- so fans are being overly sentimental, but it is not the strongest of the Bon era material. I love early AC/DC -- but this album pales in comparison to High Voltage and Dirty Deeds. Yeah, the song ""Highway to Hell"" is a classic -- and a couple of other songs are merely okay (The Girls Got Rhythm, Shot Down in Flames, Love Hungry Man). But this album is nowhere near a classic. If anything, it is the most monotonous album AC/DC ever made. You can skip this one. If you don't believe me -- fine, buy it. And watch how, after a couple of listens, it starts to gather dust."
5,Highway to Hell RULES!!!!!!!!,"Highway is definately one awesome cd. This was the first AC/DC cd i ever had. Highway to Hell (the song) is one of the greatest songs of all time. I would reccomend this one with back in black, also i like almost every song and ANGUS RULES!!!!!!!!!"
4,Can't go wrong with Hank,Mr. Locklin has always been one of my special sounds in country music. This particular CD was picked for the variety of his songs.
1,Red & Navy Changing Pad Covers,"Very thin and they are too big for my changing pad, which is a standard size. I was disappointed in the quality and will be returning them. The navy is not a true navy, instead it is a bright blue."
3,White Strings,I was a little disappointed when I recieved this RED bumper pad and found that the strings to tie it to the crib were WHITE. I thought I was buying a solid red pad. It looks pretty tacky in my opinion. Other than that it was fine.
3,It is what it is ...,"Beautiful, fade-resistant colors ...I bought two of these - one in Navy and one in Red. They are very soft to the touch (and stayed that way even after a few washes), but they are SO thin. I was really shocked.I actually had a well-worn Simmons changing pad cover that was very plush (I was buying these to replace it), and I ended up keeping it to use UNDER these. I have a hard time complaining about such a low price, but a person should really know what they are getting.So, if you buy one and don't want to be stunned by what comes out of the package - keep these things in mind:1. They are THIN ...2. Very stretchy/gauzy3. Stitching isn't anything amazing4. They do wash nicely5. Liquids pool on the top (if you have a toileting accident, it buys you time before it soaks through)6. Each one has crescent moon-shaped slots for the changing table pad's safety straps"
5,"I'll Be Damned, It Worked!","I get dry, red patches with scales on my face and outer ear canal along with oozing. This is the first treatment that was OTC that actually worked. It removed the scales, stopped the itching and got rid of the redness.Just make sure you use a moisturizer also to counteract the drying effects of the benzoy peroxide. It cleared me up in about four days. Just make sure you use it three to four times a day."
3,Works--with help.,"This was purchased for our child to watch DVDs in the car. It doesn't draw enough power to work from the cigarette lighter, so we have a small transformer that allows us to use a wall plug. This works for us because I generally have a laptop computer that needs the transformer anyway. The battery doesn't stay charged enough to watch a total 2 hour movie. Other than that, the screen works well, the speakers are more than adequate (she uses headphones and we've added a dual headphone jack for two listeners) and it's lightweight. It's adequate but not outstanding."
1,DON'T PURCHASE FROM GO VIDEO,"My player didn't work properly within the first 4 times using it. I sent it in for warranty repair and received AN EMPTY BOX back! Can you believe that? THEY SENT AN EMPTY BOX! Now, I have been trying to get a replacement or even my original unit back but the Customer Service is HORRIBLE. It seems I am not alone on this issue and I wish GoVideo would get the pants sued off them for Fraud.If you have issues, call the Attorney General of the State of Arizona. I am doing that right now. 1-800-352-8431.You can also call corporate and get EVERYONE's voice mail (does anyone really work at GoVideo?) I think they exist to rip people off. I would recommend Amazon.com and other retailers STOP SELLING THEIR PRODUCT. It makes them look bad."
1,Lasted 4 months,"I also read a positive review in CNET and bought this - it started being flaky after about 2 months, and it's completely dead now at 4 months. I wish I read the Amazon customer reviews before buying it. Whoever gave this 5 stars either works for GoVideo or hasn't used it for long before rating it.I will not buy another GoVideo product again."
3,It's Not That Bad,"After reading that this was a severe disappointment as a sequel to the excellent A Charlie Brown Christmas, I was prepared for a stinker. Perhaps keeping expectations low is the key to enjoying this cartoon. I liked it.True, there isn't much to the story. There is another Christmas play, Charlie Brown is trying to find money to buy the little red-haired girl a present, Snoopy steals the candy canes off the Christmas tree. It seems It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown is really just a collection of comic strips brought to the TV screen.However, new and old music by Vince Guaraldi adds to the mood, and this is a pleasant enough way for a Peanuts fan to spend a half hour."
1,Hideous,This version is nothing - absolutely nothing - on the Katharine Hepburn version. See that one instead.
1,Thoughts of the book...,"This book had too much going on, there should have been more focus on particular scenes and thoughts instead of just touching base on many. The charaters were totally exasperating and stubborn especially the ""heroine,"" she just got on my very last nerve. The word ""brat"" does not even begin to describe her. It was one thing to have her described as kind and giving in the story, but Ms. Thornton could have at least had Serena display those characteristics. Bottom line, try Whisper His Name (also by Thornton) which is a much better book."
4,Great Program for Forensic & History Lovers,"This is a delightful and character-driven program full of wonderful historical perspectives not usually seen on television. After watching the interviews and art director's run-through of how the shows were shot, I was even more impressed with the inventiveness of the crew's and the book author's careful conveyance of forensic history's development in the industrialization of the New World. I'm buying the rest of the series and hope that the funding keeps coming for more shows. This is a must-see for the history-ignorant youth of today."
1,Poor Quality,"I received the product and the quality is unbelievably poor. The bamboo slats on the scale surface were misaligned, making it look like it was assembled by a second grader and the surface had a scratch on it. I sent it back."
4,Review from the Synthesis,"What do you get from the Dwarves' new live DVD? As the cover suggests, you get a riotous good time that's a mixture of sex, violence and, of course, raw punk rock. Punk as real as a bloody nose and just as messy. At the Continental in New York City, Blag Dahlia and the boys play to a frenzied crowd that adds to the entertainment by frequently helping out on vocals and occasionally colliding with the band during their 18-song set. From ""FEFU"" to ""Must Have Blood,"" the Dwarves' musical mayhem is captured with suitably straightforward camera work. Bonus features include split-screen viewing with alternate camera angles for a couple songs and six R-rated music videos.- Connell Burton McDanielSynthesis.net"
5,A+!,"A+! Easy to put on and looks great on the door! What more can I say, other than it came quickly so I could get things back to normal."
2,Read before you buy!!,"Things you should know about this monitor1. Resolution and color depth is really poor. Watching DVD's on this monitor are practically impossible, all the people are RED and black. Its obviously not the DVD as I have a DVD player at home hooked up to a TV. The issue is not the brightness and contrast on the monitor as I have tried that as well.2. My monitor now has a wonderful WHITE line in the middle of the screen. The one issue is my monitor is 2 years old, but still this white line means I am going to have to throw this away. I initially paid 400.00 for it and now i really regret it.3. Please read point #1. I love watching movies on my computer, but I can't because of color depth."
4,Awesome and affordable,"This Westinghouse monitor works great right out of the box and it was reasonably priced.I was surprised by its vivid colors and sharpness. It shows no artifacts, I have not even messed with its adjustments.I just hooked it up to my old stationary Mac G4 and it worked right away.I have used it for about a month now and I am still very happy with it.Negative (the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars):Compared to my old trinitron CRT it is a little less sharp, especially small text seems to be a little blurred if you look closely, but it is a very minor issue, I use it at 1680 x 1050 resolution.An inherent problem with LCD monitors are the difference in contrast/light-darkness and color depending on viewing angle, and this monitor is no exception, but again it is still very minor thing and the monitor is very useful even for photo tweaking and retouching.Please note I only use the analog cable not the digital, so this may have an effect on the image quality."
1,My monitor is already going,"Less than a year after buying this monitor, it's already dying. Takes forever now to get it to turn on. I expect it to completely stop working soon. I have to keep pressing the power button on and off for about 20 minutes for it to finally stay on."
4,a Better Bradford Book,"Women of Substance was one of my all-time favorites.And Barbara Taylor Bradford followed that one with a number of books that, if not earth shattering ""mind grabbers"", were eminently readable. But in the last few months I have read several Bradfords that did not even begin to capture my interest. It is hard to believe that these books came from the same author. I have just finished The Women in His Life and was delighted to find a book that is right up there with Woman of Substance. You could almost tell from the first page that this was written by ""the first Mrs. Bradford""! Wish the author would slow down, be less prolific, and give us more of what we know she can do."
4,Obscure film deserves much wider recognition.,"""When Time Expires"" is a masterful sci-fi/fantasy which is not only well-acted but also has an interesting story line. It stars Richard Grieco, Mark Hammill & Cynthia Geary. Without giving away any of the main plot, the action takes place in a remote town where an intergalctic federation has sent agents to address a ""problem"" involving time relating to future events. If you enjoyed ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"" or ""Fantastic Planet,"" then you will love this film."
1,Dud,"This was one of the most boring works I have ever forced myself to read. I found it tedious, dull, badly written, and poorly organized. I was very surprised, sind Garrett is usually thought of as an excellent scholar."
4,Decent sequel,"As sequels go, this one was entertaining. Not a terribly sophisticated plot, but enough to keep me interested and watching on a Saturday afternoon."
2,Did not live up to the first one,"This movie did not live up to the first one.Every since the Star Wars: Phantom Menance movie, I have been completely turned off of and sick and tired of bratty snot-nose kids who disobeys and back-talks the adults and gets away with it and saves the day.The American Flags flown in the movie are the WRONG ones! If California was about to become the 31st state, then the flags would only have 30 stars...The map of the United States that they used is the WRONG one! That map showed the 48 states and there were not 48 states at that time.The story-line was not original. I had the 'been there and done that' feeling. All of the scenes were taking from one movie or another."
4,The Legend Continues,While it's not better than original. I found it to be a great sequel. What I enjoyed most that it wasn't predictable. It has a lot of suspense as well as drama. The movie starts with Elena and Alejandro divorcing as well his troubled relationship with his son Joaquin. Will it work out! Buy the DVD. Also the Special Features are great as well especially the behind the scenes footage.
3,Not Bad !!!,"You need to see part 1(The Mask of Zorro) first, not that it is a must but just to understand a few minor details. Not as good as the ist but a fair movie nonetheless..."
1,yawn material,I am a hardcore Dungen Family fan but Backbones Cd is booty bunk weak.The single 5-Deuce 4-Tre hyped me up for the cd but like most cd's you will not find over 3 or 4 songs worth listening to.Lord Have Mercy is decent and the song O.K. is just that....ok. Save your hard earned money and tape it from one of your potnas or just get the maxi single. Peace!
5,"""Lessons from the Road"" for real companies","The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean provides relevant, insightful information that I use on the job and in teaching others about the subject. The Five Principles define the fundamentals of a lean implementation and reminds readers that lean is about more than just waste elimination. It also addresses the importance of the organizational component which is critical to lean success. The chapter on the Common Lean Pitfalls is priceless. Well done!"
5,An Extremely Valuable Guide,"I liked the book, Rick. I don't make films, but in my horribly amerature opinion, I have to say that it nicely does the job of providing factual info to which a film maker can turn to when confused about something. The book is a manual. It's not supposed to be a thrill to read. (Chasing Amy sucked though.)"
1,Very poor product,"Bought to have for a time of need. Went through all conditioning steps. First time needed, although indicator says ful for fully charged, no power output. Will output power if you plug it in but then you already have power anyway. Complete waste of money. DO NOT BUY. An emergency ""generator"", actually a back up battery, should be available in an emergency and have high reliability. This one is completely unreliable and will not be any form of adaquate standby power in an emergency. The only function this product has served is to enrich others at my expense. Wish there had been a review such as this when I was making my purchasing decision."
3,The 1st one failed after 10 months,"I originally purchased a Duracell branded Xantrex Powersource 1800. I had the unit for 10 months. There was a power outage and the unit faulted to an E03 error.I opened a Xantrex support case online. After 2 weeks with no response, I called Xantrex directly and waited 20 minutes to speak to a service rep. He immediately knew what the error was and said the controller board had failed. An RMA was created and I had to pay to ship the very heavy unit back. It then took 2 MONTHS to get a replacement. I am pleased that the replacement unit was new (Xantrex branded, not Duracell) and not a refurbished one. Hopefully this one will not fail."
2,Grade C-,"Not much here. High Voltage, and TNT are about the only songs that are worth a repeat listen. Production is low, and the group really had not developed as song writers, if you want to call what they do song writing. This is not the AC/DC of later years."
4,The real one,"This is the real ""High Voltage"", AC/DC's first Australian release ever.I'ts not a great effort, the band is clearly stil trying to define their sound, but the roots are all there.An obrigatory purchase for ny AC/DC / Bon Scott fan."
3,Don't get what you see,You get one item not two as shown in the picture. It would be nice if it was clear in the ad that you would be getting only one gender changer.
3,I Wish There Were More Speeches,"The title is somewhat misleading, as only three of the speeches feature King, while the last is a speech by Robert Kennedy following King's assassination. There are only four speeches total in this volume, so one hopes there will be more to come. At least the celebrated ""I Have a Dream"" speech of 1963 is featured in its entirety. The speech still gives me the chills after all these years and remains the standard by which all speeches should be judged. It is the greatest speech of the 20th century, and for anybody to include it complete deserves at least three stars for including it."
4,NOT BAD BUT NOT THEIR BEST,"From Chaos is one of their best cd's but is still not the highest on my list. It was a good release to get the fans to the world warped tour this summer. As the lead band the release of this cd will attract the fans like nobody else. I believe ""full ride"" is the best song on the cd but it contains many scintilating songs.For all listeners of 3:11 this cd is still a must buy. i knew before the cd came out that it would be hard for them to top cd's of the past and they could not quite do it. Although it is not their best head to the nearest music store cause you must by 3:11's ""From Chaos""."
3,Only okay.,"This is by no means a bad album, but I think that the older 311 albums are better. The calm and mellow songs like ""Champagne"", ""Amber"" and ""I'll be Here Awhile"" compliment the harder songs, ""Sick Tight"", ""Hostile Apostle"" and ""Uncalm"" very well. There is a nice mix of styles and the cd flows easily. The production could have been better though, there are some parts of songs where the vocals and music (instrumental) don't really fit like the middle of ""From Chaos"". Not a bad effort overall but if you want to hear some 311 classics go pick up the blue album or Grassroots."
3,"Good, but....","It's a little too familiar. I spent all summer trying to find something to get excited about with this CD. The songs Champagne and Amber are both really great songs and show growth in 311 over the years, but the bulk of this CD is the EXACT same stuff that they have been playing for the last decade, and it makes you wonder if they are even serious about what they are doing anymore. I love 311, I really do, but I hate when bands end up like this, that's why Rage Against the Machine broke up, no new territory to cover. Right now 311 are just going through the motions and I'd rather wait 6 years for an awesome CD instead of 2 years for a mediocre one."
3,I was looking for something original,"Every album 311 seems to come up with something different for their fans, but this cd seems to try to repeat the blue album over again. Dont get me wrong, I think this is an album worth buing by a great band, but the blue album is almost the exact same style. Its obvious that ""Wake your mind up"" is a replica of the blue albums ""Hive"" and isnt worth listenning to if P-Nut didnt rock the end of the track with some top-notch slap. ""Uncalm"" is my favorite song on the album and probably the only one along with ""you wouldnt believe"" that arent replicas of the blue album. To end this review Ill say that I liked it better when 311 came out with a totally different and original cd every couple of years"
2,Highly disappointed,"Before the album came out, 311music.com said that this was going to be a beautiful album. Instead, it turns out to sound like ""Grassroots,"" only 5 times worse. Nick Hexum cannot write lyrics to save his life, and plenty of the songs sound similar, such as ""You Get Worked"" and ""Wake Your Mind Up."""
3,Driving Emotion Type-S,"The graphics are once again great with PS2 but it was difficult adjusting to the sensitive controls. The music soundtrack wasn't very exciting either. It sounded very 80's. The other thing I didn't like was the ability to select all the cars on the line-up initially. I guess they want you to get used to the controls first. In my opinion, wait for Grand Turismo."
4,easy to clean!,"i love my new mixer, its so easy to use and very easy to clean! It is a little on the large and heavy side but definetely worth it! Making bread is nothing at all when you use the mixer!"
3,Great mixer but woe is you if you need it repaired,I loved my mixer. After a few years of use something began grinding inside. The problem that I had was that none of the service companies given to me by Kitchen Aid for repairs were still repairing Kitchen Aid mixers. Mine has been sitting on the floor of my office for almost two years because I couldn't find anyone to repair it.
2,"Big on size, small on reliability","A friend of mine bought this mixer with the intended use of mixing mostly double-batch cookie dough.After less than a month in use, it appears that the speed controler has gone south. The mixer starts, runs 2 seconds and shuts down.She owned the 4.5qt previously. I own the 325W 5qt model. Both of these have been workhorses (i have been mixing bread dough in mine for 10 yrs - albeit infrequently- and have 'abused' it more than once.)General Pros of the Professional 6qt model: Large bowl, double-batch capacityCons: noisy, unreliable, too big for small batches, takes a lot of space.as much as i love my 5qt model, i would turn anyone away from this larger one. If you make bread in large batches, consider a Bosch or Electrolux unit instead.This model also appears to be over-represented on the refurbished/factory serviced market."
1,No! Please no more!,"If you like Sarah I guess you'll love this stuff, but it's depressing to realise how many do. This collection is more of the same: a thin voice that's so characterless it could have been computer-generated.Seeing on these pages that people who've bought a Sarah Brightman CD are also likely to have bought Bocelli and Celine Dion, makes one suspect there is a computer somewhere with an evil genius cackling over a keyboard.These singers have one thing in common: voices like fog horns with no tone, no finesse and a mechanical ability to hit notes that would peel paint."
2,I have to agree,"I have to agree with the above review. As an early fan of Sarah Brightman, I have almost every one of these songs already on previous CD's; the same recordings and everything. While she truly has a beautiful voice, I just don't think it's very fair to her earlier fans when they want something new and fresh to listen to. Everything on this CD is recycled; I could have made it at home on my own computer! There are no new tracks and nothing very enticing about this CD to make me buy it. If Sarah decides to start recording some new songs instead of continuously marketing her old stuff, I might, just might, buy it then. But only until then."
3,A bit repetitious but still good,"I've never been a huge fan of Obituary, or many other death metal bands for that matter, but some of there music is very groove laden and catchy. Much of what they use to do is what they do in this return to reform album. The guitar's are nothing amazing (actually pretty basic 3 chord riffs when you get down to it) but hey isn't what we loved about Black Sabbath(who is still my favorite band). This music has great production and the guitar sound production is impecable, and also the singer isn't quite as annoying as he once was, he even has more of a hardcore edge on this album which doesn't make it seem quite so outdated.So in closing average metal from a solid death metal band who still has some good tunes under there belt and are joining the ranks of many other fine metal bands that are returning to form. Any metal these days to me is good metal. Even if its not super technical."
3,Breathalyzer,"I would say that this product seems fairly good. I got the product about a month ago now. I haven't used it long enough to feel that it is very accurate or not. I was testing it for a while and every time that I use it with alcohol in my system, it blew out numbers around .1 to .15.A plus is that it is a complete hit if you are entertaining guests. Everyone who is drinking wants to try it.One negative is that it is less accurate when you have had a drink right before you use it. Overall, I think that this product was worth having but in no way would I trust this product to let me know if I can drive or not."
5,great stuff,parents of teenagers behold! a new way to keep the alcohol out of your home and help brace your teenager against peer pressure. This thing works great.
3,A fun party attraction,"Whether or not you agree that this thing works, it is pretty fun to have at parties. I like that there isn't a mouthpiece that would require constant cleaning and/or replacement covers, but having to blow into it is probably why the accuracy seems to waver. All in all, very fun and worth the $30 price tag."
2,not reliable but for kicks ok,This product should only be used to give you an idea of you B.A.C.. I found if you use it a couple of time in one night. It will start giving you what i know are unaccurate levels and sometimes it will stay at one level no matter how much more you my drink. You get what you pay for. You want something better you going to have to spend more money.
3,Seeking self improvement,"This book is somewhat helpful,for the first 30 pages I did not find applicable to me,and then it goes into oral board interview questions which I found quite helpful, especially if your a person who is somewhat nervous about oral board interviews. The rest is pretty much irrelevant so I rate this a 50/50 because the interview questions and answers were very helpful and the rest not."
2,"One Section is Great, while the rest is useless","The only section worth reading in this books is the example section they give you for what you might be asked in an interview. The rest of the content is readily available on the web for free if not already common sense (dress, positive thinking, prep, resume). After reading I would say this ""book"" is worth $10. (By ""book"" I mean some photocopied pages put together with a cheap binding.)"
3,ummmmm.... good i guess,this cd is good..... but definately not a five star.... hey ryan.. you ever heard of living sacrafice or zao maybe winter solstice or underOATH or even the BEST christian band ever BELOVED!!!!! those are some ideas for you all to listen to some good chritian music.. as far as Still Remains .. just another christian band i will listen to .. good job though guys
3,"""White Walls"" is a setup","yeah i'm kinda disappointed. ""White Walls"" was awesome. i loved the synth background and even got into the clean vox although i generally hate clean vox in metal. but if you're expecting the same dynamic sound throughout the rest of the album, don't. i gotta give their frontman some props though...he can scream like a madman. very powerful lungs. but the majority of the singing parts sound totally unnecessary and contrived. so that basically ruined it for me. Still Remains has a good concept in general, but they dont' run w/ it."
4,Consistently good,"After listening to Still Remains's 2 sample songs on their record label website (www.roadrunnerrecords.com.au), I went out & bought this album ""Of Love & Lunacy"". This band is ideal for someone transitioning from punk/emo to metal. There are elements of these 2 types of music & is evidently quite a good mix. Overall their album is quite ""moreish"" in a way where all the songs are consistent; there is not a song I don't like. To give this album a wow factor, one or two songs need to hit the roof with either the vocals or music. I have not listened to their previous album, so I cannot compare at this stage."
4,I have to get one of these,"Ok. I just HAVE to get one of these. I got games that have no case and they are being scratched up BADLY. Including my favorite, Suikoden.

2,"A stop gap measure before ""Back In Black""","Quickly compiled to bide time after the death of Bon Scott, ""Dirty"" is the rest of the material from the band's first two Aussie albums that didn't make it onto the U.S. release of ""High Voltage"".While it does contain some good songs (""Rocker"", the title track)most of this is forgettable. ""Big Balls"" is hardly classic AC/DC and the extra minutes added onto the end of ""Problem Child"" does nothing to enhance the track at all (the edit sounds so artifical that it ends up hurting it instead).""Dirty Deeds"" is a stop gap measure before the release of ""Back In Black"" and should be approached as such."
5,ac/dc dirt deeds done dirt cheap,great cd the music was great well done great remix of the cd . this was a geat cd when it wasa fist put out and has not gotten anything but better through all the years
3,It's OK,"Not one of the AC DC power ragers, but still a must for fans. I have had the album for sometime, and can tell you it sounds a grate deal better on CD."
3,"not bad, but not indispensible","like almost all ac/dc albums, this consists of 4 or 5 great songs sandwiched between bland soundalikes. of course dirty deeds, problem child, aint no fun & ride on are terrific, where rocker, there's gonna be some rockin are routine. big balls...well, you can think its the funniest double entendre song ever or just stupid, and love at first feel has a certain sleazy charm. bon scott could make almost anything worth listening to, and angus always tears it up, but this is pretty ehh..... buy something else"
3,Please release the original Aussie albums.,"It baffles me why the original Australian LP's aren't the standard. The sequencing is better and the complete 70's aussie albums would mean we wouldn't have to worry about EP's like '74 Jailbreak' and two Box Sets (the only track you'd miss would be the B-side 'Cold Hearted Man' and the two Dave Evens era tracks ""Can I Sit Next To You Girl"" and ""Rockin' In The Parlor""). Imagine the uproar if, say, it was the U.S Beatles catalogue as the standard instead of the U.K one.To date, the '93 CD's are now deleted (some Australian stores have old stock if your lucky) and the 1986 T.N.T is the only uncut version of as the '93 uses tracks from the U.S versions with the fade outs.Like others have said below, stick with the original 70's albums if you can."
1,ew,"waste of money, came late too, it does not taste anything like mango, in fact it tastes like a bad formula for kids"
1,Worthless,"Bought this to back up iTunes on Mac. Won't mount, no answers online, absolutely no tech support. Supreme waste of time and money."
2,Small pan and edges hard to define.,This pan was about 1/2 of a regular size cake pan and now I know why. It takes forever to decorate. When the cake is baked the outlines you need to follow are very hard to define and you have to use so many different colors of icing that it takes a very long time. If you are going to buy this pan then be prepared to spend about 5 hours decorating something that will be eaten in 5 minutes!
1,junk,thin burns easily don't waste your time or money on this piece of crap ordered it to make my son's birthday cake i used it once through it in the garbage right after.
5,Awesome this is the first series I ever read...,"And I loved it. I am a sucker for Merlin, and in this series his and Ninian's girls have been sent to the mortal world to be raised among mortals to keep them safe. The girls learn about their history and find their one true loves, only to have to fight a growing evil. I still have this series and probably won't ever sell it. I have recently read them again and I still like them."
5,It's a long path,The book is written in a way that does explain the Japanese karate training experience very well. I've done it for 35+ years and his book sums up a lot of things that take a long time to figure out. I was trained by a former JKA kumite champion who came to the U.S. with little english and a goal of teaching karate as it was taught to him and figuring out what he wasn't taught. He is still a great teacher although he has not reached out for the commercial aspects of karate.The book goes a long way in helping students understand the JKA and what is the essence of the karate training.It will be interesting to see if the author can write another book in 10 more years about what else he has learned.
1,If I could tear it in half I would.,"Firstly, I am pretty good with computers, a wize and excel and various other applications and to be honest I never have problems figuring things out, until now. This text lacks any supporting information whatsoever. Firstly, unless you have the exact tables they are using it is a wonder anything happens to work. Secondly, could it use more jargon?This text would be a great reference tool for someone who is well versed in the program, but not to someone using the program."
2,He doesn't have to worry anymore!,"The music was so-so. Just a bit off and can't quite place exactly how. Although, now that he's married Mariah Carey, it won't matter HOW many CDs he sells unless he's REALLY into his music."
1,Nick Cannon dissed B2K on 'Gigolo' since Lil Fizz spit back!,"Fizzle got a song called 'Dunka' with a crazy sample f/ MH & Snoop Dogg produced by Platinum Status that was probably left off of the ""You Got Served"" soundtrack... Callin him a ""Flowka"" AKA ""Wanksta""! I got 1 question 4 Nick... Wheres ur ""Cannon"" Nick?"
2,average at best but some Funny lines,"thanks to getting down with R.Kelly ""Feeling Freaky"" has some Funny Lyrics that cracked me up&also ""Gigolo"" which is a Cool Track.but Nick Vocally is so-so but He raps a little bit which has mixed results as well.but the Wit&Humor in His Lyrics are funny sometimes.I can't say where He will end as a Artist though."
1,AAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAAHAH,ummm nick cannon sucks thats all i got to say....only good song was gigolo and r.kelly made that song beacuse of his smooth voice.....i hope nick cannon gets a cap busted in the back of his behind
2,...Im a grown man/Not B2K... - Nick Cannon 'Gigolo' DISS???,"I dont get it when hes dissin B2K when their featured on this albums 2nd single. I told Omarion of B2K, when i luckly ran n2 him, at how much I luv dat song dat he did wit him. Den all of a sudden his 3rd single, 'Gigolo', appears! I suggest yall 2 jus download da damn thang cuz im only feelin jus 2 of em!BEST SONG: Get Crunk Shorty (f/ Ying Yang Twins/Fatman Scoop [Produced by Just Blaze])2ND BEST SONG: Feelin Freaky (f/ B2K [Produced by Track Masters, R. ""Pied Piper"" Kelly])"
4,"A Campy, stereotyped, black comedy, you'll love it !","Trashy, camp, bizarre, socially inept and smalltown bigots,all pretty much sums up the characters and storyline of Sordid Lives.Although at times some characters and storyline would be described as over the top, both are pretty much a portayal and reflection of the world we have lived in and still live in today.A very refreshing, realistic and somewhat disturbingly humourous movie, that will take you on the ride of your life.Watch it with your friends over drinks, etc and just watch as the characters become a part of you.Oh, and Olvia is excellent as trashy Bitzy Mae, a complete departuren from her usual roles."
2,Bizarre Movie,"Although the main character was a cutie, this movie was nothing short of bizarre. I felt like I was supposed to be high to get it. The main character has a secret that haunts him, a ""friend"" who is not quite friendly, who makes him do things he's not proud of. Only when he falls in love does he put it all in perspective. Still weird though..."
4,Great CD!,"I couldn't wait to receive this CD. I had their CD years ago, but misplaced it. I have played my favorite two songs over and over-Now That We Have Found Love and Try Jah Love. I had no idea that Stevie Wonder help write the song_Try Jah Love. Just loving the CD!!!"
3,Mislead,"I purchased this book after hearing about Hans Ulrich Rudel some years ago, I actually thought the book was going to be a full story about the man, but the book has mainly photo's so out five the photo's rate a 5/5 but the biography 2/5"
1,Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Celebration,"I returned the Diamond celebration blu-ray disk from a supplier through Amazon, it had audio, subtitles were fine, however, absolutely no picture throughout. I went from section to section still no picture. The return process was easy and efficient, thank you Amazon.I purchased the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Celebration again, this time from a different supplier through Amazon. Exact same problem as the 1st time, I can not believe it the exact same problem. My blu-ray disk player works fine.Same problem twice, from two different supplies, I got to believe the product is faulty."
5,Love them!,Such a good deal compared to the candy store! I live in the middle of nowhere and love to stock my own personal candy store!
5,Bringing back Neo Soul,"Because I can't see them in concert everyday this is a great CD to hold me over! Every time I buy this CD my whole house steals it to listen to it. Hence, this is the third time I have had to purchase it. If I needed to, I would purchase it again. This CD really speaks to the community without having to be vulgar or derogatory. It is all real talk! A great traveling CD...you won't skip a track!"
3,It's just ok,"I heard the single, ""Stars"", read the amazon reviews and ran out and bought this album. I'm mildly disappointed. ""Contentment"" is the only other song that I listen too besides ""Stars"". Kindred has a good sound together but the songs aren't quite there yet...."
4,Mosquitos-B-Gone,"I used the Love Bug at a family get-together. While the mosquitos weren't as heavy as I've seen them in past years, it did seem to work. Everyone had to find out what that cute bug we had was and what it did. I would recommend the Love Bug for an easy, non-messy way to repel mosquitos."
5,A Wonderful Story About Freedom For Both Men and Women,"As soon as I received Helen von Erck's novel, ""The Warmth of a Song,"" I found I could not put it down. I had bought for my husband who served in Vietnam. Since the book takes place during the Battle of the Bulge of WWII, I thought he might be interested in it. Little did I know that ""even though I am a girl"" I loved all the action, the characters seemed so dear and real to me, and the sweet spritual story that tied up the novel, hit a tender spot in me. I highly recommend this book to both men and women young and old as there's something that everyone will love about it!"
5,Blowing the Lid Off the God-Box,"As I finished reading Blowing the Lid Off the God-Box, I deliberately read slower, not wanting it to end. Reverend Robertson writes with clarity and insight, encouraging readers to look at the beliefs and preferences of others in a way surpassing tolerance. Hopefully my new found understanding will continue. If not, I shall read her book again. Blowing the Lid Off the God-Box will definitely be at the top of my list of gifts to give loved ones this Christmas."
3,shipment time,"It took much longer to be shipped (therefore received) than other orders I made with Amazong (and I make hundreds) so my nephew didn't get it until many days after his birthday. He is now out of town, so hasn't seen it yet, therefore I don't know if he liked it or now-it could be ruined by the time he finally sees it."
5,Great,The best out their and depending on how bad your infestation is it will work in a matter of days. just use a little bit around the mounds they will start grabbing them right away
5,Works for cockroaches as well.,It killed off the ants I had had problems with or years in less than 24 hours. Poof! They were gone but not just them; that night I noticed dozens of cockroaches eating the stuff as well. The loved it! In a few days I started finding dead roaches all around my driveway and front sidewalk.
3,Walking books,"I enjoy reading about Ireland, and thought this book would be like Bill Bryson's A Walk in the Woods. The donkey book was much more serious. I liked reading about the different people he encountered, but at times, felt that it was a glossary of names of potential buyers. I did enjoy his time with the travelers. He exemplified the attitudes of the 70's, and I think the book would have been more effective if he had written it 25 years ago. Still, it was a good story."
5,Incredible journey!,"I had the opportunity to travel briefly through Ireland last April - from Dublin to Galway, through the Southwest counties and along the Southern coast back to Dublin. Nothing close to this remarkable journey, but it was a great trip through the Ireland of my ancestors. When I returned home, my sister presented me with the book, ""Last of the Donkey Pilgrims"". I've just finished reading it. What a wonderful book. I felt as if I was walking alongside the donkeyman as I remembered many of the places and the wonderful people described in the book."
3,Good Read,This was a fast paced book. It held my attention the whole way. I enjoyed the different twists and turns.
2,Did I miss something??,"Why does everyone love this book? It's received such great reviews, I don't understand.I read ""The Poet"" and found it to be quite enjoyable and engaging. So I eagerly wanted to visit more of Connelly's works so I started at the beginning with ""The Black Echo"", however this book never captured me. I found myself screaming ""Would something PLEASE happen!"" Perhaps I was more interested in the serial killer plotline of ""The Poet,"" but it was a real chore to finish this one. Maybe it's the Harry Bosch character, or the slow plotting, but I'm hesitant to visit any other Connelly books now."
2,Understanding the Past to Better Know Bosch,"This captures the early Harry Bosch before some would describe him as ""too much of a killer."" The exploration of his past helps readers later on to understand his future."
4,Gritty Clever Fast Paced,"Harry Bosch is gritty and clever, often outspoken and seems always to be in trouble at work..This is a good, fast paced story and Connelly knows police work. I couldn't put this down and I'm looking forward to reading more Connelly."
3,"Good descriptions and narrative, but contrived plot.","This is a readable book, with some good characterizations and a flowing narrative. It is, however, spoiled by a hugely contrived plot which strains believability. As the plot is worked out at the end of the book unfolds it pretty much spoiled it for me. I'd read Connelly again though, hoping that his talents wouldn't be wasted as they were in this book."
3,A decent mystery novel,"This book was okay overall but took to long to finish. Also the very ending was rushed althogh the action beforehand was excellent. The middle of the book was where the action started so the beginning half was just a bunch of boring info. The ending left you very empty. Overall I didnt really get a feel about the book, it just came and went yet it does leave you with some intense scenes"
3,A predictable story by Connely,"This my third Harry Bosch novel. Connelly weaves an intricate detective story on the back of the Vietnam War. Bosch, a tunnel rat, is called to a crime scene of another tunnel rat. The initial prognosis is suicide by heroine, bt Bosch doesn't believe it. His cop's intuition leads him to an impressive bank burglary ring that tunnels into bank vaults and steals valuables. From here, the case becomes fairly predictable, but remains a great read."
4,Couldn't put this one down,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. For the first book by Connelly, this was exceptional. Harry Bosche is a great character who loves what he does. It was fun to follow the inner workings of his cop mind. The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars was the ending. It was somewhat unbelievable. Nice twist though."
4,Nice Collection,"This is a great collection for someone who hasn't read much Faulkner. Everyone needs to have at least read ""A Rose For Emily"" and ""Red Leaves."""
1,do not buy this machine!,"Even though I only ever print black type, the ""head cleaning"" process manages to empty ALL of the cartridges (including the 3 color ones) in only a few weeks. They run about $18 each so imagine how much fun that is. The great part is that the machine will not work at all if the color cartridges are empty. What a ripoff! Also the ""transport"" thing that holds the ink is easily damaged if you move it by hand.I will probably take a baseball bat to it one of these days. Serenity now!"
3,More depressing than funny....,"I like Louis C.K., and I like this show, so I bought it on the cheap during a sale. I had forgotten how serious the show is, with an entire episode about Jesus getting nailed to the cross... I will probably continue to get a lot more enjoyment out of his stand-up while this collects dust."
3,Not like a good wine ?,"I read The World and the Players of Null-A translated into French, some fifty years ago and, at the time, I rated them excellent. World and Players of Null-A beiing for me, at the time, among the best Science Fiction novels I had read (and I read a lot). Having recently read something about General Semantics, I took a fancy to read the books again, this time in English. I must confess that I was a triffle disappointed and I don't think I shall read it again. At any rate, If I do, I shan't wait another fifty years. Whereas I think I might read a third time the whole of Dune (by Frank H.), including number four and five which may seem a little bit dull."
2,Diluted Eau De Toilette,"My wife has a nose for scents, and this Dune is not like the expensive variety which is offered by your sellers. Something just does not smell right."
3,Not a perfect replacement,Ran into a couple of issues while installing this replacement:1) The float was incorrectly threaded. Since the rod was so long it required us to thread the float pretty deeply. Unfortunately the float was incorrectly threaded so the rod started gouging a hole through the float. Had to patch the float so it would not leak.2) The plunger. The part that is lifted to allow water to drain and *should lay back down to plug the drain (in order to fill the tank) doesn't use the normal hinge system. Instead it uses a rubber ring. This makes it to where it correctly plugs the drain maybe 3 out of 5 times.Not a huge deal since its our guest bathroom. Would be a huge deal if it was our main bathroom.
5,"Nabokov's version of Kafka's ""The Trial""?","A very underrated Nabokov book. This is an absurd, dark and above all hilarious book about a man sentenced to death for a reason he is not sure of. The executioner (who pretends to be another inmate in order to befriend the sentenced man) is one of the most brillant characters in any comedic work.Highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of absurd humorous books."
4,Nabokov is his own man,"Nabokov makes it clear that he is his own man, that he is not out to mimic anyone. Yet, Nabokov seems to compete with some styles of writing, explore things, he is not in dialogue with them like Flaubert was in dialogue, or Goethe, or Dickens. Nabokov is Nabokov first a writer second and that is about it; but with Nabokov it is enough. The book is peppered with some beautifully crafted paragraphs but not consistent. The story's effect is likely what Nabokov describes in his forward as doing although there is a formative element that one may find. I've been looking for Pnin II and haven't found it. That is my favorite Nabokov book so far."
2,Rambling and Incoherent,"I've read a lot of Nabokov and finished this one while riding on the Moscow Metro. This is not even close to his best work. It may have been the intention of Nabokov to keep the reader guessing about what was and wasn't real, but in the end it didn't really matter. I don't believe what the copy on the back cover says either. Cinnatus doesn't will his executioners out of existance. His head has been removed and in the end it is his spirit moving to this other existance. Apparently when you write copy for book jackets you are not required to actually read the book you are writing about."
3,"not bad, but not good","Very little of the text is devoted to analyzing Marx's most important work. For example, a total of one chapter (~30 pages) is devoted to Das Kapital, Marx's seminal work.On the other hand, excessive attention is paid to unimportant aspects of Marx. For example, most of the book is spent analyzing Marx's philosophical background, his obscure earlier works, his philosophical predecessors (Hegel & Feuerbach), and the effects of his doctrines. The chapter devoted to Singer's mediocre economic analysis is as long as the chapter devoted to Das Kapital!Although the book has some good material, that good material constitutes only ~30 pages."
1,"Awful, even the prof said so",This book is horrible. I am a graduate software engineering student and took this course at a local university. The prof said that the book is horrible and used his own exaplainations and skipped the books explainations. If I was forced to use the book's explaination and examples I would be S.O.L. The only reason every discrete class uses this book is because there are no other discrete books in competition. If you are a comp sci student they should break discrete math classes apart to discrete for comp sci and discrete from math majors. They should also have comp sci teachers teaching this because math teachers don't usually have a clue how to relate discrete math to computer science.
4,Major Reality Check,"Excellent book, a real eye opener.Another reason why I am glad we home school our children. Though written during the era of the cold war, many implications apply to today, and government's intervention between church and state, and what is being taught in the public school system. Our children are so easily swayed due to their innocence, and we must be aware of what they are being taught, and the motive behind those teachings. This book confirms that."
4,excellent,This book is especially good for the person starting out. It goes step by step in each training method and gives good pictures and drawings of the exercises to be performed. You are given traits to look for when selecting your K-9 partner as well as what to avoid. You are told exactly what to expect and if you do not get the desired result to repeat the lessons until you do. It was very benefitial to me with my first police dog.
1,This printer Sucks!,"I had a really hard time installing the ink cartridges in this printer, I called the 800 number that Brother provided and was told this is a very common problem...defective machines! I bought this printer after careful research (as I assume that you are doing)...but all I can say is you're wasting you time and money in buying this printer."
5,"Soul Music, the best story from Discworld.","Soul Music, does have good old Sci-fi rythem in it, in fact it is one of the best books in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series. Soul Music follows a young woman called Susan, Who is badly mistaken for a tooth fairy, finds that her world of people are starting to dance to a ghostly music called ""Music with rocks in"" its a lawless soul music that has appeared in Discworld, its alive... and it wont leave Discworld. Soul Music, is my absoulte favourite book in theD Discworld series, and it will be loved for those of all ages."
3,Close to the bottom...,"As a humor writer and as a novelist, Terry Pratchett has his ups and downs, with ERIC being the most complete failure among his 20-odd novels. SOUL MUSIC is not at the bottom, but it is not far above. Generally, any Pratchett novel featuring the character Death is disappointing, but this one has major problems with ALL its characters, none of whom ever come to life even for a moment. There is really no plot, no characterization, no meaningful action, and at the end there's a non-ending perilously close to ""why, it was all a dream.""Each of Pratchett's novels takes on a specific feature of our own world, and the closer the feature is to mass media, the worse the novel is. MOVING PICTURES (about the film industry) was bad, SOUL MUSIC (about the popular music industry) is even worse. The satire has little bite and almost no point, as if Pratchett were so offended by these media (as am I for that matter) that he can hardly bear to dissect them effectively."
5,What a wonderful ending.,"I've read all of the comments, but no one mentioned what a glorious ending the book has. I had a permanent smile on my face for like the last 30 pages. Soul Music is by far one of the best books I have read (and I'm always reading *some*thing), and I'm glad that most everyone loved it as well. I mean, how can you *not* just love the Death of Rats? Genius..."
3,Funny but flawed,"[For context's sake, I have been reading the Discworld books in publication order. Soul Music is #16.]I know that Soul Music is many people's favorite Discworld book, but it didn't come together like most of Pratchett's other works have. It took me about twice as long to get through--the pace plodded at times, there were one or two too many plotlines to follow, and the main characters weren't as relatable as in other books. There were some brilliant and hilarious ideas that kept things interesting, and things generally came together at the end, but even with the loose ends tied up, it felt like the book mostly just spun its wheels and stayed in one place. It felt like the whole thing was merely a vehicle for humorous music references, with no overarching goal."
5,An intense thriller with more twists than Chubby Chekker.,I first read this book 10 years ago and it is STILL fresh in my memory. The author takes you into the lives of the characters as if you were living the story yourself. The narration and dialect are superb. I'd love to see the story performed on stage. Graham Farrow's star is rising...Make sure you are there when something BIG happens!
5,Good Medicine,"Great ideas to help you learn to read situations and avoid a fight. Also, some good ideas on what to do if (when?) the above fails."
3,It was pretty good,"After reading the great reviews, I really had high hopes for this book. I read 40 pages the first day I recieved it, and was constantly left in a state of.... ( and...ok... when do we get to the USEFUL stuff.) It's a well written book, but it's all COMMON SENSE. I could of told you everything this book does. The pictures aren't helpful at all, in that you have no idea what's going on, or how to perform any of the very few moves described in this book. If you're looking to learn how to fight, look elsewhere. If your looking to read a book on common sense, DING DING DING, you found it."
4,Excellent Conservative Treatment,"Dr. Metzger's landmark encompasses a lifetime of scholarly work in the field of textual criticism and represents one of the best fundamental texts on the subject. While some have critized his method (Alexandrian and throughly influenced by Westcott and Hort), his research is impeccable and writing style emminently readable. A must for those who are being introduced to this complex and broad field of study."
5,Worked great for multi monitor setup,Worked great. Did what is was supposed to do. Received on time.Great price and value. Everywhere else cost quite a bit more.
4,It just does its job.,"It's a cable, nothing fancy or spectacular--unless you want all that money you spent on the HD TV and the HD DVD player to be for nothing. This is the link that gets the best out of your input source. Two HD connection standards have slugged it out and it looks like the other one (HDMI) is winning. But if your TV only has a DVI connection you need this cable. Monster Cable is well known for quality and it has the heft to prove its worth. Heavier cable means lower signal loss from source to receiver; that means more of the high definition programming is going to end up on the screen. It's just a cable, but you won't find a better one."
2,does it really matter?,"It is a cable for transferring digital signal... in the digital world, the smallest bit of information is either 0 or 1. In terms of electricity, it is like, either 0 volt or 5 volt. So unless the cable is so lousy that the device cannot tell 0 volt from 5 volt, in which case a gold or platinum plated digital cable is not going to do any good. It either works or doesn't work. There is no ""in between"".This is similar to DTV or HDTV -- either you get the picture or you don't. If you do, it is going to be prestine. If you don't, then there is no picture at all. Note that in this case, the analog (non-digital) portion of equipment still makes a difference, such as the antenna or the speaker cable that is non-digital.So an extremely expensive DVI cable shouldn't make any difference than an inexpensive one."
2,Plug too large for multiple monitors,"I wanted an extension cable for a new secondary monitor I'd also ordered from Amazon, and normally I wouldn't pay the extra $ for the Monster name, I figured the price was pretty good for a 4 Meter cable.I'm disappointed. I've got an NVidia GeForce 295 graphics card, which (like many graphics cards) has two side-by-side DVI ports for multi-monitor use. Unfortunately, because of the flare of the plastic part of the base of the monster cable, it can't be plugged in when there's an adjacent plug already plugged in. I tried other plugs, and they worked fine. At the price I can't be bothered to return it. I might be able to make it work if I spend a few minutes with my Dremel, but I really shouldn't have to.The build quality seems pretty good so I'll give it two stars, but if you think you might ever use a second monitor you shouldn't get this cable."
5,This May Be The Funniest Book I've Ever Read,"From Rabbis unaware that it's against Jewish law to eat pork, to petty insults stemming from a heated chess game by mail, this book has very many funny moments. It's a rare collection of some of the best written comedy you can find.Some of the essays are more enjoyable than others, so if you find yourself not enjoying one particular essay, press on. You're sure to find another that will make you laugh out loud."
5,Classic Willie singing the blues,"Great album. A must have if you are a Willie Nelson fan. The duets are incredible. Seven Spanish Angels with Ray Charles has to be one of the greatest duets of all time. And when Julio Iglesias sings ""To all the girls i've loved before"" I actually believe that there may have been quite a number (I still don't believe Willie when he sings that)."
5,A Must Have,I just love Willie Nelson.. This is a great combination for any Willie lover. It has a little bit of everything of Willies. This is a must have.
3,Not as good as I had hoped,Too much of the same kind of Willie Nelson. Most of his hits are not here. I was disappointed.
5,"From Austin, Willie is all good",Has all my old favorites. 2 cd set lots of tracks Enjoy! He has a lot of albums out but this is one of the best.
2,Quite Disappointed,"We were initially excited about this product since it seemed to fit our needs as a combination AM/FM radio, CD, and DVD player, in a very compact size that perfectly fit our entertainment center. After setting it up for the first time, we were surprised when the DVD tray wouldn't eject after the first week. Thinking that we would get it repaired, but still needing a mini-system, we ordered a second system, expecting to re-deploy the first to another room. The second system worked for about a month until, lo and behold, the same problem occurred! Perhaps it was a coincidence, but fool me once, shame on you - fool me twice, shame on me. We won't be fooled again. The only reason I've given it 2 stars instead of 1 is that the quality of the sound is quite good."
1,Search Elsewhere...,"I love Russian history and was hoping to find a book that dealt less with speculation of Ivans reign and more with the truth. Most historians tend to demonize Ivan based on little evidence, most of the evidence we have comes from letters written during his reign by a host of people, since I have read most of them I am not sure why I expected to find any kind of new information. She does a good job ignoring many details of what Ivan was faced with and instead decides to chalk everything up to, he was a maniac. Not a strong leader who was surrounded by enemies in and out of his own country, with several attempts made on his life due to the reforms he put in place, namely the Oprichnina. There are a handful of books I have found that can shed a much better light than this one, The Third Rome, Reinterpreting Russian History, and A History Of Russia Vol.1."
4,"An Excellent, Comprehensive History of 16th Century Russia","This work is a thorough history of Russia during the mid-16th century. The author presents a balanced view of the source material, emphasizing what is known, why it is known, and what is not known, about a critical formative period of Russia. That said, it is not a book for a beginner. It presupposes an understanding of Russian history and institutions, as well as some knowledge of the Russian language.One addition that would have been helpful would have been a set of ""family trees"" for the main princely and boyar families. The numerous Bel'skys, Shuiskys, not to mention the ubiquitous Iur'ev-Zakhar'ins (the later Romanovs) become very confusing. In addition, the author frequently refers to individuals by their initials, where the full name and patronymic would have been helpful."
3,"not bad but,couldve been better","the only 2 songs i really got into were severed ties yield severed heads and threnody for modern romance and the rest are...decent and listenable but,nothing special"
2,"Good, but..","I think that the album is good, but the production work is horrible. The only thing that sounds professionally recorded are the vocals, and even then they are sometimes lacking. Leave it to Trustkill to not take the time to put out a decent product... Oh well, if you want to buy this, I suggest buying the remastered version. Though I cannot vouch for it, I've never listened to, so if the production value is not there then you have my deepest apologies.The band is worth it, but this release is not."
5,Excellent Book,This is a great book. It features in depth coverage of all areas of DirectX and Direct3D programming of interest to game programmers.
4,"I like this book, as well as all those before this","I read this book during my tour round Europe. Once I started, I read and read continuously until I finish the whole book. In the end, I miss out on almost two days of tour. This is as good as all the other books that I have read before. Keep on giving us these kind of good novel to read, Jackie."
5,"Finally a complete guide to Denali National Park, AK","Discovering Denali includes information on how to get to the park, what to see on the way, where to stay (including campsites, bed and breakfasts, hotels, motels), side trips and excursions, and tips for fishing, hiking, flightseeing and even climbing Mt. McKinley (also know as Denali, ""the High One""). There are also bits of interesting history and folklore, extensive maps, and some personal insights by the author. It is the first and only source of information that provides detailed descriptions about the 43 individual sections of the park, including backpacking and camping information that heretofore has only been available upon arrival."
5,Amazing discovery!!!,"Anyone really serious about harpsichord music or baroque music should get this cd. The playing is gorgeous, attentive and creative. It is fresh and sounds new compared to many other versions. Do not miss this one, listen only to the first suite and you will get an idea of the clarity of this interpretation. Highly recommended!"
3,"Very informative, but confusing","I'm the type that knows nothing of car audio. I bought this book and was able to install my CD deck. However, when reading about amplifiers, subwoofers, etc I got lost. There is too much unfamiliar terminology."
2,Dissapointed!,"OK, this is the only DVD of Maynard I found on Amazon and so bought it. I've seen and heard him and have a few Cd's.. this one is terrible! What an old show to release on DVD. The audio is atrocious, there is a constant hum in the background.. could not they notch it out.. no.. like me if you have run out of music concert DVD's to buy then this one is for you!"
5,Great performance,"This DVD is for fans of Maynard Ferguson. It was produced from a 1974 public television broadcast and with that it in mind, the quality of the recording is great. I would reccommend this DVD to anyone who considers themselves a fan. The extras contained on the DVD are nice, but do not really add a whole lot to the overall experience of watching the performance. One extra is a dude who was sitting in the audience talking about going to the concert and the rest of the extras were live audio recordings of Maynard at concerts at other venues.These are classic performances of classic Maynard songs with an incredible wealth of backup talent. If you are a Maynard fan, you need this DVD."
1,Incorrect Track Listings,"Only 20 of the original ""Motown Story"" tracks are in this. Even though they state there are 58 songs, there are only 50. The other 30 on these CD's are not on the original set. I'm returning this order because of false advertising and inaccurate product detail"
4,Verne revived,"This is an unusual book, with a gripping story accompanied by unique illustrations and drawings. It has a masculine overview and will appeal to pre-teens and young adults who enjoy a combination of fantasy, challenge and the unexpected. Young Will Burrows likes to search for artifacts in and around his home town, often helped and encouraged by his father who is curator of the local museum. But his father disappears. Will and a school buddy then find a tunnel on one of their digs, and follow it - down, down into a culture resembling their own but of a past era. But there is danger, too. Then they learn that they are going to have to descend further, and into the unknown interior of the earth itself to find Will's father. What else will they encounter? This book is first of a series."
1,really boring,"don't buy this book if your in the USA... You wont understand any of it. It's for English, Irish, or whatever people... PASS"
2,"Some Errors, No Exercises, and Boring to Read","The book has errors in its formulas. Even the data sets used throughout the book cannot be found on the book's website. It is also very dull to read. I feel like I am reading a dictionary or reference book. It could be better if they contained updates that fixes the errors in its formulas, provided exercise problems to practice all the Excel skills it tries to teach you, and provided a CD or website location that contains all the data for the examples the book uses. It should try to relate its examples to real world problems or projects that you would actually use in a job situation. For example, the book can try to build several Excel models, with each chapter building a function or module of the overall model. All in all, I would not recommend the book. I'm surprised all 5 reviews thus far has given it 5 stars. It makes me say hmmmmmmm."
1,disturbing and sad,"This is sad. A total tribute to dog-faced overprocessed girls with zero self-esteem, working out their childhood damage with - you guess it! - a gross, lecherous man who can double for their grandpa. Sick. Great for pigs and misogynists, though! I wonder if they teach their daughters to act this way, though. Hmmm!"
2,Were the TONY voters on crack in 1998?,"I have this cd and have seen the show. I have the ""Ragtime"" cd and have seen the show. And I can honestly say that Disney's second musical attempt is more like watching the circus in your hometown than anything else. How can you even compare that to ""Ragtime""? This cd has a few tracks that are worth a second listening (""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"", ""He Lives In You""), but the rest are just bad reproductions of the movie or bad additions to the show. It seems as though they can't decide between a Disney spectacular and an African show."
5,BEST Broadway Show EVER,"This CD reminds me of the show, which was SPECTACULAR! I just ADORE and LOVE Lion King Show..."
5,It's amazing!,"I absolutely adore this CD. The show is in London now and I'm dying to see it. The music is so powerful especially ""Endless Night"" and ""He Lives In You (reprise)"". It's one of the best CD's I've got and I have a lot! If you love the film - you'll certainly love this CD even though a lot of songs are different. It's very strong and powerful, the cast are FAB!"
2,A Disney Spectacle!,"This recording proves a lot of things...First of all it proves why Ragtime should have won the Tony, because with out the bright costumes and special effects, you have this album - which besides ""Endless Night"" are all recycled songs from a cartoon movie. The Ragtime CD - which I highly recommend, is much more exciting and inspiring even just to listen to. A great musical (worthy of a Tony winning) should not rely on special effects, and should be just as affective as if the cast were in street clothes (which applies to Ragtime)"
5,Lion King a must before seeing live production,"This Lion King CD arrived very quickly and was a big hit with my granddaughter, who I am taking to see the live musical production in March 2009. Great music!"
3,Not Fantastic,"I bought to show in LDS seminary class. However, I don't think this movie would hold them."
5,"Lindbergh: In many ways, a mystery","This is a very interesting account of the life of the famous aviator. Narrated by Stacy Keach and hosted by David McCullough, it includes interviews with Lindbergh's widow, Anne, and their children, Jon, and Reeve. This documentary attempts to define a complex, and often controversial figure of the first half of the twentieth century. Also included: commentary by several noted historians. A must see for any Lindbergh fan!"
2,Phooey !,"Unless you have an unending supply of burl wood, you don't have a chance of making one of these. The directions are also very poor."
1,Worked great for about 3 months,"Great price, great sound but died after about 3 months of use. Not a good investment. I can't even get it to open up to remove my CDs. A very big disappointment. I hope that my experience is the exception."
3,It broke so fast.,I have had this mirror before and it lasted a long time.This one just broke where the ball on the mirror attaches to the telescoping part. I am so unhappy and feel they should send me a replacement.
1,I am glad the DVD was scratched...,We rented this movie thinking it would provide a great deal of humor and entertainment but it didn't. We kept waiting for it to suddenly become funny but all of the clever lines were used during the out takes before the film's premier. When this movie started skipping and then stopped it was probably trying to self detonate because it just was not funny enough to be worth the cost of renting much less purchasing and storing in your own home until the end of time. It was painful to watch and I certainly would not recommend it for purchase. The movie critics may say it was a fantastic work of art but I wanted to be entertained and I wasn't. This story line had a lot of potentional but sadly it missed its mark. I only gave it one star because a zero was not available.
2,Drags,"Is it just me or does this movie seem to drag on and on? I was expecting more from the director of ""Broadcast News."" That was an excellent movie and this is not. Adam Sandler should stick to comedy. This movie didn't come together like it could have. It was disappointing. The only bright spots were the acting of young maid and her daughter. Cloris Leachman is not a funny drunk, she is a stupid drunk. Let's not glorify drinking for the young kids, OK?"
4,Spanglish,This was good. It was hard to see Adam Sandler play more a serious role from the usual silliness he usually plays. This was worth seeing...I thought it could have used some more funnier parts than it had.I would suggesting renting this to see.
2,Okay,It was good in the begining but got VERY boring in the end. The whole movie was slow pacing without much excitement. I even fell asleep close to the end!
1,very bad,I want 2hrs of my life back. From now on I will wade through the fan-club reviews to read the more accurate reviews to weed out crappy movies.
4,Surprisingly Good!,"If I had known how good this movie was, I would have went to see it at the movies instead of waiting for it to come on a movie channel. The trailer didn't make it seem like a drama, I thought it was a comedy. This was one of those movies where I didn't want to miss a minute (even if the restroom was calling). Adam Sandler was surprisingly good and so was the rest of the cast."
2,Not very funny.,This film is a mess. It's not very funny. The highlight is Chloris Leachman. The rest is awful.
5,Great story! 4 1/2 stars.,"Either those giving this a negative review don't have any relatives with severe neurosis, or they don't recognize their own. Well acted by Sandler, Vega and Leoni. It's not a 'gag' movie or a typical 'Sandler' vehicle. Which may turn some off. And Brooks' fondness for insanity might play too big for some, but overall, a nice love story."
2,Holy Moly,"This stuff be kickin'! I mean seriously this stuff rocks. I mean that's what it is, rock. And it sure rocks a hard one. The mother of all rock. The mother of all c*ck. Oh wait, now I'm getting it mixed up so which one is it? Oh yeah now I remember it's the latter. It's a gigantic overrated piece of c*ck."
3,"Good, dumb fun, almost clean, even.","It's slow and silly. If you had trained your pre-teens to play this (hardly any skill required) you'd be clipping coupons and skiing in St. Moritz.The lyrics are dumb. The playing is sub-high school skill level.But a passing adult must have written, 'You Shook Me All Night Long.' As a celebration of lust, it's up there with Van Halen's 'Drop Dead Legs.'How do I know this stuff? Everybody likes simple, silly stuff."
2,most overrated band ever,"this only got 2 stars because its the best album by acdc... which isnt saying much. they are soooo overrated its not even funny. angus young is a terrible guitarist. this album is full of crappy commercial songs with simple riffs, horrible vocals, and subpar soloing. do not waste your money and time getting this album, its a disgrace to rock n roll. if you want real rock... where they actually can play their instruments... go pick some beatles, hendrix or rolling stones. two stars and lucky to get that."
1,A highly overrated album!!!,"I detest this album! It really is an overrated album and Brian Johnson is the worst singer of all time who only screams, why can't he sing? is he on drugs???? I wish he would die right now. Who buys this crap??? Avoid!! Get the Black Album from Metallica insted."
3,Gift for my son.,"I'm not a fan of AC/DC, my son is, but he really likes the album. As long as he doesn't blast it through the whole house it will be great."
5,Short but informative,"the album Back in Black by AC/DC is one of the best ones you'll ever hear. With the recent program Ultimate Album on the Vh1 channel Back in Black has gained a new audience. For a good reason too. If you want a nice slow but still rocking song to hear you go for Hells Bells, if you want a classic rock song you go for Back in Black, and the best song on this album ou go for Shook me all night long. And for great songs refer to any other song on the album."
4,Stop Whining You Tools,"For gods sake, 'brian cant sing' 'its stupid becaus bon isnt there' GROW UP. brian is a fantastic singer, even tho he might not hav the sneer of bon, he makes up for it in concerts. he gets the crowd into it much more than bon did A GREAT PERSONALITY. i gave this a 4 bcaus it is nowhere near ac/dcs best album, any of you who think this is ac/dcs best album annt fans. Hells Bells And Back In Black Are Great. But The Rest Is Filler"
2,Dissapointing..,"No lyrics, no new histories,no bonus tracks. Just amazing photos.I think this is not much for someone who already has this CD."
2,I don't have my cds,"Hello, sorry mi english...My order dosn't come! Today is october 25, and i don't know how where are my cd's!! please, tell me something about, i can not rastreate it!2 AC/DC cd's1 Weezer's cdThank you very much!!"
3,Doesn't compare to Bon...,"I loved this album when I was a freshman in High School, but can't hardly listen to it now. The songs are just silly. Bon's clever sneer is gone and Brian Johnson sounds like Rod Stewart with a hernia. Compared to Powerage (their best album)it hardly bears a second listen.Get the early stuff"
3,Excuse me if I sound a little annoyed here...,"BUT WHY DOES EVERYBODY LOVE THIS ALBUM? WHY? WHY, WHEN ANY OF THE BON SCOTT ALBUMS ARE TWICE AS GOOD? Brian Johnson sucks, as a singer, and only Malcolm's riffs pull this up to three stars. If I said it once, I'll say it again - Brian sounds like the ""Where's the Beef?"" lady. Simply put, this would have been the best album ever - no questions asked - if Bon had sang it, but he died, and Back in Black turned out merely OK. AC/DC wasn't just about the guitars, it was about great singing, too, and Back in Black and all the albums after that just didn't have it."
4,Please be quiet!!!!!,"all you people who gave this a 1 made me laugh by butt off. ""cry cry whinge whine"" maybe if you shutup for a minute and actually listend to it you would like it. sure, there is only 3 chords, but the way they are put together ROCKS. and to that emo who said ""blah balh no skill'"" METAL IS JUST PLAYIN 1. yes 1 chord over and over with heavy distortion and a guy trying to vomit on stage. and to that doofus who said ""whine whinge listen 2 dire straites and especialy enter sandman GROW UP. they arent bands, there an embarresment."
5,The Album that made me listen to everything else,"This is probably the single most important album I've ever heard. Without this, I wouldn't be anywhere with music. I'd be listening to all this new crap that sucks. From the opening gong of Hells Bells to the final note of Brian Johnson's favorite Rock N Roll Ain't Noise Pollution, you will not be disappointed. When I saw them in 2001 on the Stiff Upper Lip tour, they played half the album, or close to it. I saw Hell's Bells, they opened with Shook Me All Night Long, Halfway through I heard Rock and Roll..., Back in Black, and the second song was Shoot to Thrill. If you don't own any version, someone should smack you. Where have you been? This band holds the 2nd highest number of catalogue sales in the U.S. second only to the Beatles, but that's no surprise. Most of the album still gets radio play. Buy it now (probably the 2003 remaster) now. Then go back and listen to Bon Scott piss people off."
1,this F**kin sucks,Baby Squirrel nuts... that is... this cd is horrible. i hate music that sounds the same on every song. i'm 12 and i laughed when i saw the tabs for these songs. It is to easy to play on the guitar. i can teach my unexperienced friends to play this schit in one day!
5,One of the greatest albums ever made,"In 1980 most bands were really crappy since the hair metal [...] had just begun but AC\DC was an exception (their debut album came out in '76 anyway). This album made bands like Twisted Sister and Spinal Tap see what real rock was, even though they never changed. The song 'Back in Black' is a perfect example of why this album is so great and 'Hells Bells' has one of the best intros ever. This is also the first album with Brian Johnson and I think he's even better than Bon Scott. Commercialling doesn't lie here either, this album sold over **16 MILLION** copies worldwide, the only albums I can think of that are around that are Led Zeppelin IV, Nirvana's Nevermind and Metallica's Black Album (The Beatles albums have sold in the the 20 - 30 millions). If you are an AC\DC fan then you should already have this (if not you're a poseur), if you are a hair metal or ounk fan then buy this, it could change your style to heavy metal (hopefully). Just buy it."
1,no thanks I really don't like the most overrated band in the world,"How can you people say that ac/dc is good?How can you say they are legends?No,they aren't,they suck.Every single ac/dc song has the same sound to it.The difference between all their songs?The lyrics.Thats it,just the lyrics.Hells Bells sounds strangely familiar to Back in Black and wait!Haven;t I already heard you shook me all night long???I thought that was the first track on this cd!!!If no one sang on this cd I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between all the songs.ac/dc +overrated=sucky cd"
3,"well, well","This is a good cd, but not my favorite by AC/DC at all. The album has it's moments, but there are some songs that are weak, so this album gets what it deserves from me, and it deserves 3 stars. AC/DC is one of my favorite bands, but this album is their weakest album. It is still an album that I can enjoy very much. Lots of people do give this 5 stars, I don't. Everybody has a different taste ofcourse, so don't get angry now. I do recommend this album if you like hardrock/metal, but if you are new with AC/DC you should not buy this one first."
4,An old and worthy chestnut,A classic well worth reading by writers and students. It is purposefully a bit academic so I rated it a 4 not a 5. It was a 5 for me.
4,The Down and Dirty,"I've used this book on the run to clinical sites, and for keyword type presentations.I have the usual suspects on my book shelf,.. Big Miller, Baby Miller, Morgan and Mikhail, Barash, Secrets, and that terrific Benumof tome, Anesthesia and Uncommon Diseases.Have to say that this is an ultra concise resource, and worth a place on the bookshelf for its sheer timesaving qualities."
4,Gene Hackman movies,"I bought this video because I had recently read the book ""The Domino Principle"" and wanted to see the movie. As an added bonus, the movie ""March Or Die"" was included. Both films were enjoyable to watch and I recommend them to anyone interested. Gene Hackman has always been a favorite of mine and he didn't disapoint here."
5,"Great, highly readable statistics textbook","This is one of the most readable mathmatics textbooks I have ever seen. I highly reccomend it, especially to high school students taking AP statistics."
3,Not too great,"This book has ok examples and explanations of them, but the wording of the text is horrible. I do not think I would of understood it if I hadn't gone to class everyday and hear my professor explain it."
3,Whoops wrong book,I accidentally bought the wrong edition of this textbook from this seller. A little more information from the seller would have reduced the risk of this happening.
1,bad acting not worth the price,"Pro The animated artwork is good. The story was good.Con: Bad acting actors go through they are reading scripts no emotion, looks like make with video camera, alot to pay for 50 min movie nothing interesting on second disk unless you are in the film or a family member of someone who is. This film deserves negative stars."
5,Love it!,Somebody's leaving somebody!! Down -to -earthy lyrics sang by a down- to- earthy (earthy?) lady!
1,I don't melt when he sings,"It's okay for a 10 year old but not a stand out. I don't stop and say, how did he do that? His tone does sit with me well. Sounds very tinny. I think he is a bunch of hype."
4,360 Degrees of Wisdom,"Without a solid grounding in Astrology or Tarot, the casual reader would see this book as a parlor game. Although the premise seems simple the deeper experience of Sabian Symbols provides a tantalizing peek into the ""Mysteries"". The book is well researched and written to take the reader on a journey as profound or as light as required. The cards are a nice bonus and serve as a tangible way to experience the concept more fully."
1,Two strikes - you're out!,"Based on the reviews I read, I bought this as a Christmas gift for my teenager. Unfortunately, the numerals on the clock would not display correctly and were barely visible. A trip back to the store confirmed the malfunction and I was given a new one which was checked to make sure the numerals displayed correctly. Regrettably, they did not check the contrast. The button for the contrast does not work at all, making the numerals invisible at night. My other complaint is the user's manual. We had several questions about the operation that should have been addressed in the manual but were not. For example, we tested the alarm with the ipod and the first song came on. How do you set the clock to wake up to a particular song? Can you even do that? The manual did not address that. There was not even a parts list, leaving us wondering what two items were. Also, the radio was only able to receive 2-3 stations. I'm taking it back to the store to get my money back."
3,Interesting!,"I had fun reading this book. It's one of those things you can pick up, read for awhile, get amazed, then pick up later and do it again. It's become a conversation tool in our home when I ask my wife, ""Did you know....?"""
5,Great Vent!,"I purchased 2 of these vents, one for each end of my attic. Very sturdy and pre-painted white. Product comes with 1/4"" standard mesh and provides 93 square inches of Net Free Area, as stated. Store where I purchased said they could special order 1/8"" (smaller mesh) if I'd like, but that the Net Free Area would be decreased by 33 to 50%. They pointed out that for the longterm health of the structure, I was better off having a balanced ventilation system (where intake = exhaust) than having to punch extra holes in the side of the house in order to do so. Then they recommended a can of Raid Bee Killer for that occassional wood loving bee that may want to call my attic home."
1,not a good buy,"this product does not keep the sun off babies in a vehicle, not thick enough and the suctions does not work."
2,OK if you have nothing better to do,"Unfortunately this game's cover-box looks much more promising than what it actually is. The chopper is kind of difficult to control and it seems that you never have enough ammo to proceed through the battle decently. Therefore you end up trying to figure out what to shoot and what not and that usually ends up in being shot down (which is very easy to happen). Graphics..? too simple I would say. If someone just gives it to you, sure, go ahead and take it but don't pay money for it."
5,A Great CD,I first heard this cd in LP format in 1968. It is an excellent cd with Beatlesque influences and wonderful harmonies. The band was way ahead of their time and the music holds up today.
1,Poor and boring book,"Although all facts in international investments is covered, the author did not add his comments or insight.No further knowledge gained except knowing the facts. I wish I could find a more interesting and useful book on this topic."
2,Difficult to get through,"I suppose if one looked closely at all of the information available at Amazon, one could learn that this book was written about fifty years ago. I suspect that the original was written in the author's mother tongue (Italian) and this is a painfully translated version. I found it to be very difficult and tedious reading."
4,Impressive writing....sypathetic plot,This book was not boring...it had excellent qualities and Laurence tells the story of this old woman very well.the story is realistic and makes the reader feel sympathy towards the old woman.
2,This book is pretty bad,"Well, I'm being forced to read this rather boring book, and to top things off I've got to write a dozen essays on it. It might be a good book for an older woman to read, maybe even enjoy... but speaking from my point of view, as a teen-age male... it sucks. This book shouldn't be taught, I don't think this book has been enjoyed by anyone in my class. I don't recomend this book at all!"
1,90 year old Hagar Shipley recalling her life.,I am an OAC student who has just completed this book. This fictional story is one of the most lethargic books I have ever read.The constant shift in tenses is confusing. And althought the book is tedious and uninteresting I believe the book has a alternate meaning perhaps one about life or what we should do with it. If you are planning to read this book I suggest cole's note's.
2,Not a good book for those who don't believe in god.,The end of the book was disappointing because she shows really believes in God. Otherwises the book is pretty boring. However the shifts for present to past are quite clear.
1,this book is pointless and uninspired,"This book was very irritating to read. I felt like I knew exactly what kind of impression Laurence wanted me to get, and she went about it in an unskilled way. The themes were simple, and the charactes were archetypal and predictable. If you pick up this book, you are in for a boring read."
1,one of the worst books ive ever read,"This book was one of the worst books I have ever read. Hardly anyone in my class liked it. This book is depressing, boring, dull and annoying to read. Everytime i tried to read it I kept falling asleep and i have insomnia! This book does not deserve even one star. This book was written by a miserable old woman about a miserable old woman.There are so many books written by canadian authors that would have been much better to read than this book for my OAC english class. This book was garbage i do not suggest it."
2,boring,"I had to read this in high school and when i read the first few pages i couldn't go on. It was incredibly boring how it started off talking about the stone angel in the graveyard and i honestly couldn't care less but i had to read it for the term paper. other than hagar's occasionally amusing use of sarcasm and her bitterness towards the world, it was one of the hardest books i've had to read. her sometimes funny sarcasm, bitterness and negativity towards the people around her still cannot make up for the rest of the incredibly boring novel."
1,Run for your lives!,"I've read this book a couple of years ago in high school. Yes they make you read this book in Canada! How can anyone be so cruel? How horrible is this book you ask? Let me put it this way, you'd have more fun watching your toilet seat than reading it. It's about a very old woman (ancient) talking about her failed relationships with men, and complaining about how her kids abandoned her, yada yada yada. And if you're Canadian like me, you've probably had to do quizzes on it in grade 12. Let's see ""Who gave Hagar water when she was in the hospital?"" or ""What was her favourite flower?"" ...It's boring, unimaginative, and a woman's guide for hating men. It's HORRIBLE!If you suffer from insomia, I suggest you read this book. If not, run for your lives!"
4,Gebirgsjaeger in Action,"Gebirgsjaeger in ActionThis is the first book to provide substantial detailing of German Army and SS Mountain forces in World War Two, including order of battle, profiles on principals, and accounts of operations. Also the book covers material on uniforms, weapons, special equipment, and tactics. However, the book covers relatively little on counter-guerrilla and/or anti-partisan activities. The main focus and emphasis is on operations in Poland, Norway, the Balkans campaign, Crete, the Caucasus, and Finland. Overall, I have found this book to be highly readable and although the material is dated it is still historically significant in the study of modern special warfare. I believe that this title will appeal to the professional and armchair military historian and serving military personnel."
4,Definite reference.,"Gives out the name , register conventions and description of all (or most) operating system calls. A definite must for programmers. It only covers upto AmigaOS 2.04 though ...Since it is no longer available, an alternative would be to buy the AmigaOS Developer CD, which includes all this online (it also includes info upto AmigAOS 3.1)"
1,Don't Buy This!,"Most of the Canon cameras are too small for this case; therefore, your camera will just wiggle and bounce around in the case! If you want to scratch your camera then go ahead and buy it, otherwise I'd look for a different case!"
1,A piece of JUNK!,"No lanyard. Within a day the zipper broke and the camera fell out making this ""cool"" case a very expensive piece of junk. It is bigger than I expected--much bigger than the camera--and it is bulky. The green is VERY pale green, too, not the intense green pictured here. I was very disappointed. Avoid!"
3,Appearances can be deceiving,"The case is very nice in appearance and functionality, but unfortunately it does not provide a great fit for certain cameras. The case is much larger than I had expected and my Canon SD1000 does not fit snugly in the case as I had hoped. Do not expect to be able to carry this case in your pocket as you would the camera by itself. I must say that I am fairly disappointed by the case's size but at least it provides good protection for the camera."
4,Eva Black camera case,I just realized that I did not get the screen protector as a bundled bonus along with the cloth. Is it at all possible to receive it yet from the company. Otherwise no complaints. They delivered very quickly. I also was under the impression that I would get a strap to attach to the case so I could wear it over my neck. The case will be perfect for me especially if I could receive what was not sent. I hope to hear from you.
3,Watergate Report,This report was detailed but not for the average reader. I recommend it to Watergate journalist who may use it as a research tool.
5,Great Refresher of Lost Tools,"Mr. Good brings forth a refreshing approach to a lost art, that of writing. As we continue to degrade globally in our communication skills, Mr. Good provides us with most useful, and easily understood guidance in hopes of getting our writing back on track. In the business world I am constantly bombarded with tainted memos, e-mails and communications that leave me to wonder what happened to the command of the english language. This book is a great step foward in getting me back in touch with how to correctly communicate with my clients, peers, and prospective clients without embarrassing myself due to the lost art of writing properly and getting my point across.It has been said many times, ""It's not what you say, but HOW you say it"". So now I have a guidebook on once again saying it correctly.This book should be a must for anyone in the business of communicating."
5,"The $25,000 Letter...","As a business professional, I often convey a specific course of action to my clientele. This client communication frequently takes the form of a business letter and must concisely set an agenda and yet persuasively `win over"" my client to a particular thought process. A well-written and professional business letter can differentiate my position and will often mean the difference between winning an account and receiving the obligatory ""Thank you for presenting, but..."" letter from the prospective client.Mr. Good's book has no doubt enhanced my writing abilities and assisted in my professional business development. Many thanks..."
5,Well Done.,"I have used other mystery books in the past, but this one is my favorite for working with senior citizens."
2,Found this at a library book sale for $1...,"...I overpaid!I usually enjoy Michael Crichton books. This was not one of them. Lots of rambling and technical jargon with plodding, forced and uninteresting corporate suspense worked in. Crichton clearly did alot of research about airplanes and aeronautics; unfortunately, he shares all it with the reader and most of it is boring. The book reads like a movie script. I'm guessing Hollywood was smart enough to realize no one was interested. Read Crichton, but skip this one."
2,too many give aways,The biggest problem that I had with this book is that I had the thing figured out by page 40. I enjoyed the tense writing style once the media got involved and I enjoyed the overall pace of the book but I think there were just too many obvious clues dropped as the book went along. Try Agatha Christie if you want a tough mystery!
1,Not what I expected,"This is my first Crichton book. As a Private Pilot myself, I have a HUGE fascination in Air Disasters, and thought this would be 'right up my allay'. It wasn't. In all fairness I've only read 1/2 of it but don't intend to finish it because it doesn't seem to be going anywhere?! Starts very well but then slackens off rapidly. I've found that there are too many characters which are not established long enough to be remembered (I had to keep flicking back to remember who they were!?!) The plot doesn't thicken, there is way too much technical jargon (some of it might as well of been written in Latin) and the chapters are too short, so there's a lot of chopping around. My advice... unless you're an aeronautical engineer with a lot of time to spare... skip it!"
4,Solid Book,"This novel was very intriguing and I couldn't wait to get off work so I could go home to read it. Although it is very technical and takes the reader into the world of aeronautics, at its heart it is a mystery with great characters. A book that is definitely worth reading."
4,What can I say?,"Very Good. Gripping. I read this on a road trip. I couldn't put it down. You get enveloped in this story and the mystery that surrounds a troubled airliner, a company in peril, and an odd episode over the Pacific Ocean. And all the events that follow are excellent. Airframe follows the investigation, the media's reaction, and the top level management trying to cover everything up. It has lots of suspense and surprises at every turn. A story of Conspiracy, Politics, Business, and Business Tycoons on the loose. Cover-to-cover Heart pounder. You must own it."
2,Disappointing,"The book in itself was typical Crichton material; well-researched, touches on relevant issues and hard to put down. However, I must say that this book lacks anything new. In my opinion, this book is just Disclosure with a woman in the lead and the airline industry instead of computers. Take note of these similarities;The company is in the midst of a significant event. In Disclosure, we have a merger, here we have a big sale to ChinaThe leading person finds himself/herself in a situation where he/she in in danger of being out of a jobMeredith and Arthur conniving against Sanders while here, we see Marder and Richman conniving against Casey.Again, the monday, tuesday, wednesday thingThe ending's almost the same, the hero finds himself/herself in public spilling out the beans.Well, that's about it. To boot, I already knew the ending. That son thing was topic of a news article around a year ago in an airline company somewhere. It really did happen."
2,Airframe crashes and burns,"One thing consistent about Crichton books is that they are difficult to put down...and I found that to be true of Airframe, although I disliked it. The characters are flat and I found myself struggling to root for the protagonist. Crichton obviously has an axe to grind against the media, to the extent that it damages the novel. The depiction was so one-sided, my book actually leaned over when I put it down.That said, I have to admit that I read the book in one day. The story picks up considerably in the last few chapters. The author did a good job of keeping the mystery alive until the end. The background on airplane manufacturing was informative, although also somewhat dry.Reading Airframe reminded me of eating a big bag of potato chips -- you open the bag and find that you can't eat just one, the next thing you know the bag is finished and you feel somewhat ill, full but not satisfied"
4,Tou Lee's Review,"Like many Crichton books, Airframe has a a good story. This book will keep the reader glued to his seat, like for me, it was a one-sit reading."
3,Not Great but Okay,Not one of his best books but is a good read for anyone interested in aviation. The story is loosely based on a real-life avaition diaster that occured a few years ago in Russia but with slightly different results
1,REALLY boring!,"Not interesting at all, I got 1/2 way through, and threw it out.Boring, silly semi-tech stuff...Did he really write this? Nothing like his other books."
4,The safety of airplanes,"With this book you will learn some things about airplanes and TV networks, is a good book but I don't recommend to read it in a flight, just kidding, the writer keeps you reading all the time except when he describes the preparation for the people for the TV show and the epilogue, but that is a short chapter, is a good reading."
5,AIRFRAME...You won't be able to put it down!!!,"MC at his best, next to THE LOST WORLD, this is cliched,""GOOD GUYS ALWAYS WIN"" without being stereotypical or predictable. Grab it and tuck yourself in bed...You will be late for work tomorrow."
5,Thought it was great!,I thought this book was a great book! It was exciting and impossible to put down! I was caught up in the story from the first page!
4,"Teaches you a lot, makes you think, but not one of his best.","Airframe teaches you a lot about planes and the way they are built, and makes you wonder if you should get on your next foreign carrier, but it doesn't have as much suspense as some of Crichton's other books."
2,A distinctly low-altitude Crichton performance,"Cardboard characters, a stilted plot, wooden dialogue...where to begin? When Norton Aircraft VP (of Quality Assurance, no less!) Casey Singleton told another character that the wing spar of a particular plane was ""two hundred feet long - almost as long as a football field"" I knew I was in for a rough ride. Doesn't anyone edit this kind of dreck?Aside from an amusing take on the media (particularly a TV newsmagazine reporter obviously meant to be Mike Wallace), the book slogs along for 431 pages before coming to a tepid conclusion.I'm a sucker for books on airplanes and the aviation industry in general but I can't recommend this half-hearted effort."
4,One of Crichton's Best,"Of all Michael Crichton's novels, Airframe has to be one of the best. It was action packed all the way through with factual information added all the way though. You had no clue what he was going to hit you with next and what was going to happen to Casey next. A recomemded book to read if you're interested in Airplanes or Michael Crichton as a writer"
2,This book had a great concept but simply lacked interest.,"The book started off interesting and had a well-considered plot and concept but it carried on too long. When an interested reader picks up the book in a store it seems to be very interesting but it was a let down. Crichton lacked interest in the middle of the book and I started to no longer want to finish the book. The ending is a surprise and it is something that a Crichton fan will enjoy. But for the first time Crichton lacked interest in one of his stories which was really surprising. It's a book that you can read if you don't mind long amounts of time with nothing resolved. And if that wasn't enough, the technical terms and abreviasions of companies and government branches make the book at times boring and hard to follow. So if you're in a mood to pick a book that is not fast paced, it's yours ! I guess the saying 'never judge a book by it's cover' stands true to this book."
3,"Good, not great","Reading the book was better than watching TV. However, it was just better than average. The book was also quite short. Crichton started a new chapter every time the scene changed, almost like he was writing a screenplay. Some of the ""chapters"" were only several paragraphs long. This created quite a bit of blank page space. With normal segmentation the book would only be about 225-250 pages. My recommendation is that if you must read the book, check it out of the library. Or wait for the TV movie, I doubt Hollywood will bite"
2,"Good luck with the movie, Crichton!","I've come to expect much more of Crichton than this screenplay he has written. I found it boring. Does anyone else get tired of his explaining the too complicated techie stuff to some inane character? This time is was the assistant; usually it's some precocious child. And what about that assistant? Didn't know what to do with him at the end? So, you made him a drug dealer (no hint of that in the rest of the book). This book stunk"
5,A Terrific Book...,"""Airframe"" is a story about the detailed investigation of a bizarre plane crash. It's fast-paced and very well written. This book will definitely change the way you feel about the airline industry!"
5,Definetly worth reading!!!!,When I began reading Airframe I really wasn't interested about airplanes and all that type of stuff but after reading Airframe I realized what I was missing!Crichton weaves some of the best charecters ever.Usually Crichton doesn't have that good of endings to his books but this book has one of the best endings I've read!I can't wait for the movie to come out.Although I'm not sure I agree that Demi Moore is fit to play Casy Singelton.Matthew Mchgounahay is also going to play Teddy Rawlings.But anyways read this book if you like airplanes and read it even if you don't.
2,Michael Crichton at his worst.,"Airframe lacks character development with shallow stereotypical playing the lead. Crichton goes into so much detail with all his aeronutical knowledege that the plot becomes almost non exsistance. I was up to page 300 and was resisting the urge to wipe the tears of boredom out of my eyes.Jenifer Malone is probably the most stereotyped character I have ever seen in seious novel. There is no realism to her. Casey, the heroine, is not much better.The technical mumbo jumbo does make it intresting for the first hundred pages or so but after that it just becomes to much.This is classed as a thriller but in my opinion it is not. If your idea of a thriller is having to read through two hundred and fifty pages of pointless jargon then there is something deffinetly wrong with.Michael Crichton has done a lot better than this and I'd recommend that you read one of his better books such as Sphere, Jurasic Park, Disclosure or the Andromeda Strain."
3,Enough to Draw Me Along,"Having read the hits Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Congo, and Rising Sun, I decided to give this one a shot. I am glad that I did not stop in the middle of the book (when I felt that I should have because it became bland and seemed endless). I hung on and read a surprising ending.Crichton's hopping back and forth between the main character and the reporter for Newsline sort of threw me off, and there were some chapters I just didn't read because they were pointless, but the whole picture was clear when the two leads combined in the end."
2,"Timely, but little else","It's so discouraging to see that he's orienting his current work towards a future movie screenplay. I truly loved his early books; Congo, A Case of Need, Andromeda Strain, Sphere, but Airframe and The Lost World were just terrible. Shallow writing, no suspense, nothing to grab you from the get-go and keep you through the entire book. It seems that Crichton, along with Grisham are paying more attention to the potential dollar signs at the end of their movie credits rather than producing a novel that lives up to their previous, and stellar work."
1,Ridiculous,"The book is really full of air-industry information - and the absolute majority of its readers will never be sure if it is accurate or not. Characters?! I don't think Crichton has ever heard of that... And, by the way... After all those pages he must have real low esteem for his readers because he wants us to believe that absurd - and childish - explanation for the accident... Ok... he probably is under pressure because he needs to keep up the 1 book (i.e. movie) / 6 months pace. Dear Amazon.Com reader: don't waste your time. Buy someone's smarter and less compromised with money work"
3,Aviation Learnings,"Of course, I picked up this book because it was written by my favorite author. His other books were thrilling and good, and I thought this one would be the same... But no, it turned out otherwise.I barely knew anything about jets when I first started to read this book. But the book taught me some stuff, and I found it educational.... In a way. It was interesting, but where's the fast-paced stuff that I expected? Nowhere... There were lots of abbreviations and I had some difficulty catching up on those stuff. Either I didn't know what they were, or I forgot what it was and had to look back and find out. The book was kind of slow, but it was interesting enough to finish it. I had to look up words in the dictionary, too! And I had expected something amazing at the end, but no, it wasn't... So it's 3 stars for me."
5,Airframe rocks!!,"Airframe is one of the best books by Michael Crighton I have ever read. It can get a litte monotonous sometimes, but for the most part it is exciting and a definite must-read."
3,Good Subject Matter Details,"Give it to Mike, he will write about it. Most authors now days just develop a formula and just pump out he books one after the other. That is one of the reasons I always give him a little slack, he tries to take on new and different themes and topics - ok the T Rex books are all about a new vacation home. I am a bit of an airplane junky and read a good amount on the industry so I loved the extra details he throws in, it gives the book more depth without slowing it down at all. The book also has a good, thriller type of pace that keeps you interested. The only draw back I have is that maybe he could give us more on he characters, a little back story or maybe a sub plot of two. Becuase the story is very straight forward and not complicated with anything extra it reads easy, if that is what your looking for this is an integrating book"
1,HORRIBLE,THIS CD WAS HORRIBLE ! THE SAME SONGS/MUSIC WAS USED OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THE 52 VERSIONS.I CANT USE ANY OF IT.
4,Great System for the price,"I have used this notebook daily for two years now, and have for the most part been very happy with its performance. I upgraded to 512 ram immediatly, added an external cdrw, and wireless card. With these three upgrades it has been a decent desktop replacement (though I dont play many games). I seldom turn this system off (usually only when traveling). I would say it has been on 60% of the last two years. I am able to multitask very well, often having four or more IE windows open plus Adobe Photoshop and an office app. or two going all at once. It does max out the procesor often and can be slow at times, but overall it gets the job done. The drawbacks are: gets a bit hot and loud, no internal cdrw, 20GB hardrive to small, speakers not very loud, and the case is very prone to cracking. I have never dropped this system but both corners near my speakers have little pieces broken out and of coarse the hinges have cracks. Two years of heavy use was worth 10x the $600 price tag."
4,Excellent value,"I was looking for a small system for my bedroom that would accommodate cassettes since I still have quite a few of these. The Sharp XL HP737 offers quite a bit of power for a low price. Good sound quality and pretty easy to use controls. The only thing I would suggest to the manufacturer (and all manufacturers of consumer products) is that you have a population of 80 million aging boomers who still love their music (remember, we invented rock!)so try to make bigger buttons on the remote and larger print so we can see them.Also, Amazon's service, as always, was amazing!"
4,Embalasasa,"Have had this CD since it was first released, and Samite is a good artist for a light, African sound. He has a very expressive voice, and his songs are melodic. He gives a synopsis for each song. This was my first Samite CD.There is plenty of African rythm on this CD and soft music too. My kids even like this CD, and I will continue to be a Samite fan and have since purchased more of his music."
5,The Safety Standard. Period.,"Thirty years ago I met the predecessor to this volume. Sounds like a long time? I have made it those 30 years because of what I learned from this book.If you are a chemistry student (I was a freshman when I encountered this book) then you need to read this book before you start working with your reagents.If you are employed in a field where you work in a laboratory or come into contact with laboratory materials (albeit - it is aimed at chemical labs and not specifically at bioscience labs) then you need to read about the materials you could be exposed to, BEFORE you are exposed.If you are a medical professional - then you already have one.If you are a legal professional and you deal with toxic torts: you need one.Concise, clear and accessible by any high school grad. If you work with chemicals - you need this book."
5,Real Magic??,"I know someone that was at Vandenburg AFB when MindFreak did their episode there. That's the only case where I've known someone that's been around for Criss Angel's illusions. She said everything was exactly as advertised ""What you see is what you get."" I'm half convinced the man is using real magic; not the ""magic"" an illusionist would use but the real thing. Mind-blowing whether it's actually an illusion or real magic. I've been to a David Copperfield performance and I have to say I love the way Angel does his performances on the street impresses beyond Copperfield or anyone else. Own seasons 1 and 2, looking forward to season 3! Criss Angel, if you read through these reviews, looks like you're barely sleeping. Don't crash and burn without needed rest. We can't continue to be impacted on that ""emotional level"" if you don't give your body a break once in a while. Love to catch a live performance someday...care to come to Misawa AB, Japan?"
3,"Go Criss,go!","Not as good as season 1,but still worth watching.Some excellent tricks that have you scratching your head once again."
3,Packaging Incomplete,"I need for ALL the packaging to be included. The Disk 2 was in a CD paper envelope inside the package that had Disk 1 in it. I'm not sure if it was supposed to come with a third Disk or not, but the other Criss Angel Seasons Three and Four came with 3 Disks each. So whether or not it was supposed to come with a third Disk, I still need the packaging to be complete. The seller said nothing about the packaging being INCOMPLETE ... Or at least, I didn't see anywhere where any statements were made regarding incomplete packaging. Whether this merchandise is supposed to have a third Disk or not is BESIDES THE POINT, because the packaging should have included something more than just a CD paper envelope for Disk Two."
4,Super Reader,"Another fun Burroughs romp, elsewhere than Earth. This time the main character is a pilot, and he ends up on an alien world (not a big suprise, eh?) and proceeds to go about having some Buck Rogers style adventures, getting involved in politics and war. This is made up of two different stories/novellas, or whatever you want to call them. If you like other Burroughs style books, no reason you won't like this."
1,Junk,You can buy 12 pens cheaper then the 12 refills. However you get 6 medium and 6 fine pens and I wanted 12 mediums. As such I purchased the refills. All I really need is the blue since that's the one I always run out of.2 out of the 12 refills had only 3 inks (missing 1) and look like their missing blue.The first refill I opened I ended up with one refill that didn't work which was blue...The second refill I opened had 2 blacks and no blue...The third refill I opened finally had a blue that worked. So I have 1 blue out of 5 packs with 7 packs left to go.
2,Not worth the money,"I am a medical aesthetician and a massage therapist and although I know my anatomy well, I did not find this DVD very helpful. I did learn a thing or two (more like a refresher) however not well enough to do injectables. Not comprehensive enough, not worth the money."
1,"Flashier package, but still an amateur device","The tank size (which is intentionally omitted from the product description) is too small for large jewelry or sunglasses. To find a real ultrasonic device, search the web for ""cavitation +ultrasonic jewelry cleaner."" This is an amateur ultrasonic cleaner in a ""designer"" plastic package, designed for sale to those who haven't done their homework on ultrasonics."
4,Wolves unto sheep,"Jean-Philippe Dallies-Labourdette and Bruno Pautigny book S-Boote, does a very good job of telling the story of the German Navy's version of MTB's/PT-Boats (note: S-Boote were bigger, initially more heavily armed, and used more effectively than their allied equivalent). In this book, the authors tell us about the initial development of S-boote (their pre-war years) and follow it up with a very good year by year summary of how the S-boote did and what their equivalent were like at the same time period.Overall, this book is really a 4.5 star book, but since Amazon doesn't support half stars, I had to round down this time because there aren't that many descriptions of engagements, especially given the price of the material. However, the pictures are great, there's interesting material on the types of mines the German Navy used, and some good general material that can keep wargamers, modeler, or historians interested."
3,Detailed analysis of Real Japan,"Whittier Treat has obviously done his homework, it is obvious that painstaking research has gone into this book. This, naturally, means that at times it can be very dry. One wonders how the wonderfully colourful lives of his subjects can be so two-dimensional on paper. However dry this book is, it is a must-read for anyone who is interested in comtemporary Japan, just because it is full of such detail. One cannot hope to understand the mind of the Japanese youngster without having some idea of the images they have been bombarded with from birth. This book gives excellent analysis. Just remember to drink lots of caffeine if you are planning to take it in large doses."
