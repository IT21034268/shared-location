1,forgotten,do not like this band but my daughter does so I bought it for her and would never buy it for myself
2,Over priced,"This item was made very cheaply, I kept this item because I do not like returning merchandise."
3,Too narrow....,"I ordered these boots. Love the look, but I have wide feet and they were cut too narrow for my feet. I also purchased Sorel Kaya boots in the same size, and they were cut wider and fit me fine."
2,"Won't fit cup holder, doesn't keep coffee hot","The Aladdin 16-oz coffee mug does not have a sealed drinking spout. Coffee can spill. This very round mug does not fit cup holders in 3 cars I have tried. It keeps your hands warm, but coffee doesn't stay warmGood points? It fits the Black and Decker Brew-N-Go coffee maker."
2,Not quite right,"This fits perfectly in place and has that factory color just like its says but my pyle pldn72bt radio doesn't fit. The radio is too tall to fit through. If it were just a bit bigger, I would rate better but it doesn't work for me"
2,Great Flavor but Poor Quality,"I bought a Showtime Rotisserie and I was so pleased with the meals that I prepared with it. The flavor of the chicken and pork was out of this world. However, after a few uses the Teflon non-stick coating on the rods came off in my food. Who wants to eat Teflon coating? They would not honor the warranty. The machine was operational, but they considered the rods as accessories. They would not replace them."
5,GREAT BARGIN,This is a fantastic machine and a great bargin. With Amazon's free shipping and kitchen coupon the price can't be beat. AMAZON'S delivery was so speedy. Arrived 2 days after placing order! Quite impressive with the Christmas rush for UPS. The machine yields healthy cooking. Thanks AMAZON.
5,Lives up to Expectations,"I purchased this product in November, 2007. I've used it several times and I'm quite pleased. I highly recommend it."
3,not much luck,"I got this product very excited to have it, and when turned on, it wasn't turning. I returned it but i am going to give it another try, maybe it was a manufacture problem. :-(Wish me luck!!!Maria"
5,Great Product,I used this to cook Chrismas dinner. This product is awesome. The 15lbs was great. i would recommend this product for anyone. Thanks set it and forget it.
4,Superior Roasted Chicken,"The day after I received this I roasted the BEST chicken in my life. A few days later, I thought I would try it again using the basket to make salmon. Perhaps it was an error on my part, but the fish took much longer using the Showtime then would have in the oven....and how do you turn off the rotisserie when you are not using it? Purchased a beef roast and we'll see if it is as good as the chicken."
1,"Food tastes great, rotisserie made cheap....","I loved the concept of a small rotisserie. Bought one, used it every week until it started falling apart in less than a year. So I switched over to George Foremans rotisserie which is designed so much better that I haven't had a single problem. I've bought other ron popeil products in the past. Unfortunately, his commercials last longer than his products."
4,Ronco,"Ronco really makes a good product, a little pricy but well worth it I assure you. Gave it to my parents for Christmas and used it the very same night. Easy to use and convenient to clean. Comes with a helpful bundle of cooking racks and poultry ties and instructions that also includes new recipies. Buy now and see what your missing!"
1,Be careful to buy RONCO products !!!,"I placed an online order of a nife set at RONCO and cancelled it 5 minutes later. To confirm my concellation is in time, I called RONCO hours later. Despite their promise on the phone, they still sent the package. After I refused to accept the shipment (follow their instruction), they still charged me $35 for the shipping. These people do business in such disgraceful way. How can you expect a good quality product from them?"
2,BE CAREFUL who you buy it from,"I bought this oven from Ronco. The oven is cheap. It does cook a great chicken. It is hard to clean. The rotisserie can roll as you take it out and caused 3rd degree to both my wrist. The worst part is do not buy it from Ronco. They sell you name, address, and credit card number to scammers. I know because it happened to me. Buy it from anyone who will not give your credit card number to Ronco. Use pay pal or Google to purchase safely."
5,Great documentary to the very end,"I lived in Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, a small town which was situated within the 10 mile range of Three Mile Island. I was 24 years old at the time. All the townspeople, near and far, were wondering what they would have to do to escape if a nuclear disaster occured. The documentary gives you the same intense feeling that I felt at that critical moment in time, and is excellent in how it delivered acurate detail of chilling events as each day passed by. I recommend this film and hope that it will teach many individuals of what can suddenly happen, without warning."
2,cheap but not real good,I didn't expect much for the price that I paid but I will spend more and not have the problems next purchase. The wench works fine coming in but getting the cable back out is a real pain. Pulling the cable out is a real problem.
2,No Reverse a Big Loser,"Bought one for light job but the hand held controller's In/Out function was defective. Winch would pull cable in fine but would not turn in reverse--had to release clutch and free-wheel (potential safety hazard with tension on line) to get cable out.Returned this one for a second--same problem but this time the hand held didn't even have the word ""out"" to reverse the drum--again, would only turn the drum in the ""In"" direction. Decided to keep it anyway and make do.(Return service with Amazon was excellent--only thing good in this deal.)"
2,directions needed,It was obvious how it worked. Not clear how it set up on the trailer hitch. Poor directions!! I returned it.
4,Master Lock Portable winch,Not a bad little unit. Yes it's slow but for the price it's a good unit. Just adapt the mounting to your needs and it will give you the pulling power you need.
5,Squigle toothpaste,"I am very satisfied with Squigle toothpaste. I am in chemotherapy and subject to associated mouth sores from the drugs. Squigle is effective, very gentle and not irritating to my mouth."
5,"Cute, cute , cute","We are big fans of Jakers. The kids really enjoy watching this. Jakers is all about storytelling. The Grandpa is telling tales of his youth to his grandsons. Since this is set in Ireland, the animals have a bit of a brogue and use Irish sayings. After the cartoon, real Grandparents tell stories of their youth. This encourages families to share the past."
1,Not as advertised,This product was listed with the Gloss Boss as if it would work with it. It does not. I would not have ordered it if I had know that it would not work.
4,sweet cacophony,"one of the things i appreciate about helium is that they put the music first. they (mostly mary timony) glide through colorful and distorted tunes without pretense or posturing. the effect is finely balanced--both unnerving and endearing--timony's winsome, whispery voice floating over the noise of her grating guitar and effects. her creative songwriting and arrangements, arcane lyrics and layers of sound textures may not be instant karma, but if you can get below the surface noise, you'll find a whole other world."
5,Jangly moody pop meets dungeon and dragons,"This is Helium at their best. I'm not sure what affects me more; the dirty, nasty songs or the dungeon, chamber songs. Unfortunately, her voice is a little much to take sometimes, fingernails against a chalkboard but worth listening to nonetheless."
5,Picking into migrant families lives,"I have recommended this book to teachers, counselors, therapists, social workers, politicians and law enforcement officials. It takes you inside migrant families lives and lets you share with them their success, sacrifice, and nostalgia. Beth Atkins captures more than images in her photographs. She captures pride, hard work, and nostalgic happy lives away from home (Mexico).Originario de Moroleon, GTO Mexico"
4,"Easy read, yet sad","I write that as a title because if you look into these children's eyes there is hope and sadness. It bothers me to see how these children and their families are forced to live. I live in the N CA wine country and I see the same thing going on here. Exploitation of the workers, inadequite housing, awful pay.I would LOVE to see a follow up book about these families now that it is 10 years later to see how they have fared. The young gang member who left his gang, the teenage mother who dreams of going to college, the little boy who wants to buy his parents a car. Did any of them make it?"
2,Very unsuccessful,"I too was unable to make the bubble toy work without making a mess. My 4 year old got very frustrated and gave up on it. The price here is also ridiculous for such a small toy. The must success i've had with a bubble toy, is a big wand bubble maker I got at Walgreens for 2 dollars. They sell them now for the summer months. I have a hello kitty one and it makes the biggest bubbles. Always a hit just that it will last only 1 or 2 afternoons with the amount of solution it uses. No mess with that so far."
2,Sad,"This was an interesting looking book for my artwork and I downloaded it, the trouble is that I am unable to view the images. This was greatly disappointing. I was not able to see images on my kindle or the computer application."
5,Love This Product!,"I love this product! I have used it for a couple of years with great results. It doesn't break my skin out, and it is a great price. It looks oily at first, but after a few minutes, when the product soaks in, the oiliness goes away. It has a very sheer feel after the initial application. I switched to this product from a more expensive department store brand and could not be happier. Oh, and I forgot to mention I am practically albino -- red headed with freckles, and I live in South Mississippi to boot. I LIVE in sunscreen."
5,Microvelour Closed Back Slipper,"These were comfortable, had cushioning and support. Just as advertised on the website. I have no regrets ordering this pair."
2,not for hardwood floors,I purchased this vacuum yesterday and am bringing it back this morning. It worked great on the carpet but does not pick up a single speck on the hardwood! I couldn't even feel any suction when I put my hand underneath.I am so dissapointed because I really like the bag/bagless feature and have not been able to find that on others. I prefer to use a bag and keep all the dust and dirt from flying around when dumping a bagless canister. If you have wood floors don't bother it won't pick up.
1,Another Dissatisfied Consumer,"I was initially impressed with the Savvy's suction and edge cleaning ability, especially on dog hair, but after less that two years, my vacuum is hardly even functional. The switch has been replaced once, and the second one is now starting to go bad. The ""stop"" that holds the unit upright cracked off, and cannot be replaced without replacing the entire bottom of the vacuum, and the roller/brush works only intermittently in spite of the fact that the repair shop says the belt is intact. My previous Hoover Self-Propelled had problems, too, so this is definitely my last Hoover."
5,The best ting since sliced bread :),"I wanted to write about this prduct because it has been a big help to me. I live in a residence room that is... well... cozy to say the least. I recieved one of these as a gift and I have used it on a weekly basis (not solely for myself I assure you). It all stacks together to ensure minimum space usage and its colour (or rather, lack there of) matches anything in my room. I just thought others should know how much I have enjoyed it. Thanks for your time!"
5,Should be in everyone's library,"The iconic piece for cello played by the cello icon. 3-channel SACD--not surround sound, but a quantum leap better than the best CDs."
4,Great Product,"Seems to be comfortable, and is very easy to put up and down. The down side to this porta crib is that there is no carrying case for the shade/top level of the crib so if you are camping you have to come up with a way to take that with you. Also the shade is attache to the top level so you can't have shade and be in the bottom."
1,I HATE this thing!,The assembly on this product is impossible. The sides won't latch making it impossible to assemble. I hate it and regret buying it. Watched online videos to help with assembly and the product still doesn't assemble.
5,Functional baby center,The Playard with changer/basinette works well. We know our daughter and son-in-law will be visiting often. We plan to take care of our new granddaughter for them as well. The unit lets us keep all the items we need in one spot. It works for this newborn stage. Hopefully it will continue to as she grows. It seems well built and looks nice as well. The purchase went smoothly. The product arrived at time stated.
2,[not good],"This book is merely a collection of antecdotes throughout his recruiting career. In true Bill Radin style it's like a stream of consciousness about recruiting, with no central theme or direction to the writing. ..."
5,Buy it....,"This Man has so much history....just buy it, his CD's will improve any record collection!"
1,Tuff Tonno,"Although the Tuff Tonno was reasonably priced, it has made my truck bed almost inaccesable. It is difficult to impossible to roll up because of the sytem design. I will never by another product like this again, and will not recommend it to anyone I know."
2,not worth,"I wouldn't recommend buying this camera.Entrance level camera. Fixed zoom. ""Focus free"" means you can't actually adjust focus on your subject. It is the relatively large ""depth of field"" that ensure the picture is clear. Think about the money you are going to spend on film and developing, it's not a good idea to buy a [bad] camera..."
1,2008 Super Duty,"I understand that this was an in-channel part. But when a brand new truck doesn't have the window motor power to close all the way, something is not designed properly. Get the tape on visors and save yourself the headache."
1,Good except in Virginia,"If you live in PA, OH or MD, this is a very good book. However, if you live in Virginia, it is not worth the price as there are very few Virginia fairs shown."
3,It's okay,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter at Christmas and it came on time and was placed under the tree. However, it does not really leave a hand print, as described. I was sorry to see that because as balls go, the handprint would really have made it special! My daughter still enjoys playing with it, so I'm going to keep it."
5,"Can't beat ""Made in the U.S.A.""","Fought sticking bundt pan for too long, dumped it and groaned about spending money for another! But, I was wrong! This pan is worth every cent and works great! No sticking, beautiful browning, releases completely and easy clean up. Thank you Nordic Ware!"
3,Nordic Ware Platinum Collection,"I've used nordic ware bundt pan (cast iron type) for over 10 years and when I ordered the platinum collection, I thought I was getting the same product. However, I prefer the previous version bundt pan vs the platinum collection bundt pan for these reasons. The previous nordic ware bundt pan is heavier (cast iron feel) and the platinum is somewhat lighter. Also, I like the dimension on previous version, 11 3/4 x 10 1/2 vs platinum's dimensions 12 x 10 3/4 (it doesn't give the height on cakes that I'm accustomed to)."
3,Good enough for the money,"It's easy to set up and start using, although one of the basketballs it came with would not stay inflated. It isn't terribly sturdy, but my grandson isn't that old yet so it works for him. I think any child older than eight would destroy it pretty quickly, though."
3,Learning Jave Through Applications,I ordered this book for my son after he and I both read what was said about it. It turned out to be very elementary and my 14 year old could not use it at all. I ended up sending it back at my expense.
3,I wouldnt buy it....,"The Swiffer Carpet Flick is only good if you have small kids running around the house every day. Dont buy this if you are a cat person,the reason i bought this item was to clean up cat litter and other kitty doodads, but to tell you the truth it doesnt really work unless your mess is EXACTLY the rite size. Unlike the desription on the box, it doesnt pick up hair or lint either.The Swiffer CArpet flick is conveinent but unless they have specialy made swiffer carpet flick messes to clean up. i would stick to the old fasioned vacuum."
3,"decent, but not wonderful","While the measuring marks on both the dropper and bottle are useful in their way, the dripping makes using this bottle a two-handed job that's occasionally messy and isn't extremely precise. It is an improvement, both in precision and cleanliness, over using larger bottles that don't feature convenient pour spouts, and is lighter than the heavy glass bottles so often used."
1,Warning: It Leaks,My roommate bought 2 of these. one of them leaked since he first bought it and the second lasted for 3 years before it too started to go. I wish these were made of solid glass but sadly this is not the case.Don't go buying these thinking they will last forever because they won't
5,2+1,The results are amazing! Glad to find this old favorite it makes hair soft and silky. Sebastian needs to bring this one back
5,At 8 weeks my baby slept all night (11p-530a),"I read this while nursing my 4 week old daughter. We started EASY right away by her 8th week she was sleeping all night (11p-530a). Sometime around 3-4 months she started sleeping until 830a and she dropped the 11p dream feed. At 23 months old she still has the same routine down by 6pm and she sleeps until 8am. I didn't follow the book to the letter, I let my daughter nurse back to sleep but I figure the more they eat during the day the less they eat at night. At any rate this booked taught me a lot about routine and that has been key to helping my child sleep well. ."
1,Hogg 's book is not for breastfeeding families.,"Counter intuitive Breastfeeding and parenting information not grounded in the research about the fundamental developmental needs and behavior of a breastfed newborn. She is the next new dangerous fad in parenting books!Hogg is asking parents to replace tons of research and judgment with her authoritarian information about caring for a breastfeeding newborn. Parenting does not work that way and neither does breastfeeding. Remember she does not write from experience of being a parent, s he is not a medical professional or any other type of professional study.She is a nanny, a baby nurse.She is NOT a board certified lactation consultant."
1,This book did not help me,"I drove myself crazy trying to follow the guidelines in this book and I think that trying to implement these with my son actually caused him to have sleep problems. I think the suggestions in this book, especially regarding putting the baby to sleep, are too rigid and don't give you enough options for when the suggestions aren't working. I found Dr. Sear's The Baby Book, and Elizabeth Pantley's No Cry Sleep Solution to be more helpful."
1,Not what I was hoping for..,"I was hoping for a book that would complement my AP style, not one that recommended putting my baby on a schedule pratically from the day we came home from the hospital. Maybe good for some, but not for my family."
4,A godsend for new mums everywhere.,Being a first time Mum you soon realise that everybody you talk to is an 'expert' and apparently has the answers to all your 'problems'. There is alot of myths and pressure out there to get it right. New mums don't want to be lectured they just want to be listened to and given understanding and options. The baby whisperer helps to guide you on your way without dictating and making you feel clueless like so many other baby books do. The best thing is the use of humour which made me laugh and see the lighter side of many of the situations I had found myself in with our precious little bundle. A great read that uses a gentle guiding hand instead of an over opinonated iron fist.
1,Very annoying,"I was recommended this book by an aquaintance and I can't imagine why! It is very preachy and judgemental of other points of view. It reminds me of jaded organized religions that can't just believe what they believe, they have to rant about other people's perspectives. No one person has all the answers, I like to pick and choose what I agree with, not be told by someone else why it's wrong."
1,We would not like this nanny,"We did not like her book. If you want to treat your new baby like a bothersome inconvenience to be conditioned and scheduled into your life, this IMO could be the book for you. If you'd rather consider your child as the special and uniquely needful individual he or she is (no two human beings are the same), and avoid ""one size fits all"" cookie-cutter approaches that make nice acronyms, then would suggest looking elsewhere.There were some interesting aspects of the book, but on the whole her advice did not make our baby happy or healthy. Found the tone of the book to be needlessly condescending as well, as if nobody knows better than Tracy Hogg Enterprises. No thanks."
2,Stressed me out,"I got this book at a gift at my shower. I started reading it while pregnant and it seemed logical and reasonable at first, but then I started getting stressed out. So many details in the guise of making your life simple. What kind of baby do you have? Can you figure out how to read his signs? Follow baby's lead... Ugh, it all seemed like too much to factor in and if you get it wrong you start all kinds of bad habits in your baby. Give me a break, this is a baby, they don't get bad habits until later."
1,Stay Away From This Book,"Most of the content lacks a basis in actual research, and doesn't fit the vast majority of babies. No other book has caused as much frustration among new parents in our circle, and there's a reason for that. It attempts to place unnatural routines upon newborns that simply does not mesh with their biological and evolutionary reality. Sure, a lucky few parents will have babies who naturally would have done what the book hopes will happen for all babies. For them, the book was actually unnecessary from the word go. I hate giving advice on infant care, but this is one book to avoid."
5,Baby Whisperer,"If you want to sleep, this is the way to go. Bought it for the wife but both reaping the benefits."
1,Talk about pressure,"As if things weren't stressful enough with a newborn in the house with all the expectations of the baby, the new mom and the family and friends hovering over....this book just makes things worse. I only give it one star because it is edited and all the words are spelled correctly. this book is a bust. don't waste your money."
2,Whispering to???,"I was so excited when my neighbor lent me this book, I read it in one night. I could not have been more disappointed! It did not avidly encourage breastfeeding suggesting that we should put ourselves before our wee ones (breastfeeding will make your breasts pancakes)! Hello, if we wanted perfect boobs and a perfect body, perhaps we wouldn't have had babies to begin with. We all want what is best for our lil ones, and this is where I hated this book. The Hitler approach may work for a select few (you should see how your baby should be scheduled BY DAY 3!!!), but not in this house. I like the EASY approach (eat, activity, sleep, you) and treating your baby like an actual person, but I didn't need this book to tell me that!! All in all, a let down of a book!!!"
4,Loved It - Saved us a Ton of Headaches as New Parents!,"We loved this book - both my husband and I. The author has a very balanced view on baby scheduling and other helpful tips for new parents. Our sweet baby girl was on a wonderful schedule within 3 weeks and slept through the night at 6 weeks old! Now, we realize that all babies are different, so you need to see what works best for you & your family - read it and see what you think!"
3,"Worth of reading, but not mind blowing","When I got home from the hospital I realized that all my efforts attention and actions were about having a healthy pregnancy and easy labor. I did not do much research or preparation to handling baby. I visited 2 hour class of infant care at the hospital with my partner while being pregnant and felt ok. But the reality was I did not know what to do with my daughter and I was getting upset as I had hundred questions about spitting out, her crying, feeding, etc. I went on line and ordered several best sellers for baby care ( including this one). It did not answer my questions but helped me in other way: I was not panicking that mucho when my daughter crid but tried to understand what can get her upset. I can't not say that I know in every case the reason of her crying but very often can stop it guessing. EASY routine did not work out with my daughter though. II would recommend to read this book to a new parent, but also educate yourself reading otherntheories."
1,Bad Kindle edition,"Do not purchase this book for your kindle. I am extremely disappointedNot only is it MORE expensive to purchase the electronic version (which is ridiculous) but they did NOT convert the charts for proper kindle viewing.There are quite a few informative charts and helpful notes within the book.Sadly the editors did not convert these charts & tips to work effectively within a digital reader. It is virtually impossible to read the charts.As the chart information is not listed in the text you will fight with your digital reader to scroll through the chart for the valuable information - like on baby signals, how to read them and what they mean.I don't know why they didnt just use a chart format that the other books I have on kindle use...but it is frustrating and ineffective.I want my money back."
1,BEWARE!!,"If you believe that your wants are more important than the needs of your child's then by all means read this book. If you believe that babies have only needs and it is up to us as parents to meet those needs then skip this and get the Sears ""Baby Book"" or ""The Continuum Concept or better yet just trust your instincts...yes you do have instincts despite what the so called ""experts"" will lead you to believe."
3,Very limited in details,"I read and reread this book trying to figure out how to put my twins on EASY, but never could find the details on how to apply the methods. I bought the VHS tape which was even less specific. I thought a lot of the rest of the book was common sense and not very useful."
2,First Time Mom,"I read this book when I was pregnant, before I had my first child. Before I knew better, the advice seemed very logical and I was committed to following the advice. However, once my baby was here, I found it to be unrealistic and did not fit my baby's needs. It's not a bad book to read just to get ideas. I read many baby books and took them all in in order to make my own decisions on what to do with the new baby."
1,Use your commonsense,"This book was mostly a total waste of time. I am the mother of three children. This book was given to me as a gift and at first held my interest. But then I realized that this woman was getting paid big bucks for stuff that I already knew and had used and am using with all my children. Example: How many new moms talk to their babies like they are just lumps? None that I know! I would have loved to have seen Tracy with my first son!(now 6 years old.) He had a mind of his own even at a few days old. He would have challenged a lot of her ideas! I know, because I tried them! (and I didn't even have her book!) Babies aren't as cut and dried as she wants new parents to believe. So please! Save your money and use your own commonsense."
4,Very good book,"This book has a lot of great advice and I would totally recommend this book to first-time parents or even parents that already have children. There is a section on how to help get your baby to sleep through the night by ""tanking them up"" how to wean off the bottle and how to understand their cries. Very good book!"
1,Very overrated when you learn about Tracy,"I have read this book front to back, has anyone seen articles in the British Press? Think people should look at them! Apparently. she left her two little girls in the UK to persue her career in the States and has never brought them up herself! I fail to see how she can advise on childcare if she didnt look after her own daughters. She certainly doesnt sound like an ""expert"" to me! Her breastfeeding advice certainly doesnt seem accurate to me, i would very much like to know where her qualifications came from, as she worked as a mental nurse in the UK, and NOT a midwife etc..... I seriously think that the world of Hollywood could well believe the hype, but really, the people that know her in the UK have something very different to say.A concerned mother of 2."
1,Avoid this book,"I, unfortunately, received this book as a gift when my baby was born. I initially tried taking her advice and was frantic wondering what was wrong with my newborn who was not on a schedule. I consulted other books (written by American Academy of Pediatricians, Penelope Leach, and breastfeeding books authored by certified lactation specialists) and talked to family. I was comforted in discovering there is absolutely nothing wrong in a 1-2 week old newborn NOT being on a schedule (it is actually unrealistic). My son is now 10 weeks old and has settled into his own routine - without my prompting. Additonally I do have some time for myself - but that is not my main objective. Avoid this book entirely. Her information on breastfeeding is dangerous. If you feel that you want a reference book carefully review the author's credentials and trust your instincts."
1,Breastfeeding is best,"As a registered nurse, I feel entitled to share with other readers that the information about breastfeeding vs. bottle feeding was incorrect and biased towards bottle feeding. There are always reasons for not breastfeeding, and many of them are perfectly legitimate. But to not tell readers that breastmilk is best for babies is a downright LIE. Formula will never be as nutritionally sound for your child as your own milk."
3,Maybe a good book if I could read it....,"I'm sure this book has some great advice/insight based on other reviews, but I can't get past the first chapter with this author's informal way of speaking. I have limited free time (as I'm sure all of you new mothers do) and don't want to waste any of it reading complete British slang like ""mum"" for ""mother"", ""mitts"" for hands, instead of ""eating"" she says ""munching"" and calling babies ""kippers"". Worse than that, she calls the reader ""luv"" every other sentence. I am not Tracy Hogg's ""luv"" and don't luv her at all for not writing a regular BOOK without slang that I paid $7.99 for.As a disclaimer: I have nothing against British People and in fact LOVE the British accent. In addition, I love this slang when I'm watching SuperNanny - since that's entertainment for me. But, when I pay money for a Book so I can learn something, I don't want to be annoyed every sentence.Just my 2 cents..... (or ""pounds"", however you look at it)"
5,Excellent guide to every aspect of U.S. immigration.,"Excellent guide to U.S immigration. Includes summaries of all necessary INS forms, quick guide and copies of actual forms. Also includes a step by step instructions for all immigration processes. A MUST not only for immigrants who want to gain visa/resident/ or citizen status, but also for U.S. citizens and officials who want to sponsor or deal with immigrant issues."
4,"This game is great, but tedious","I really reccomend this game for hardcore gamers. It takes an extremely long time to gain levels past 20. I have been playing this game for over 1 year and have only hit 50 with 1 character. The concept of this game is great. By far the best i have ever played. The graphics are awesome and RvR is the best idea i have seen. But, with all games there are drawbacks. I just recently hit 50 with one of my characters. Which took me a year of playing. Around 3-4 hours daily. There are also class balance issues as well. If you buy this game. I suggest becoming an assasin. They are hard to level but they are Gods in RvR. Albion is the infiltrator, midgard is the shadowblade and hibernia is the nightshade. Being any other then one of those you are dead meat."
2,While the game idea itself is a great one,"Mythic Entertainment failed it. Once it been a great game, but then the developpers decided to nerf classes left and right. Instead of nerfing them to bring them inline with other classes they nerfed them into oblivion. Issues which are uncovered in beta state don't get fixed till way after going gold. Issues with classes (such as enchanters) don't get fixed for at least half year though many customers complained about it.Little tip for new players: Don't start on servers where you have more than 2000 players playing during prime time. You'll experience bad lag and even worse: you'll experience crashes of the whole server so that you won't be able to play the game for another 10 minutes (and then it's not safe to assume that the server won't crash again)."
1,Not the ball pictured.,"The ball that was delivered to me is not the ball pictured. It is not even close. Amazon did process the refund, but don't waste your time unless you know exactly what you are getting."
4,"Nice texture and durability, but a little small",We bought this as a replacement for a similar ball that popped. We were disappointed at the size and stiffness of this ball compared to what we were replacing.
1,Not what it seems...,"""The rating is toward the product I purchased, the item arrived on time and we did not experience any difficulty with the seller of the item. We have had the bed for less than 1 month and it has fallen apart. The bed is simply a piece of shaped foam with a cover on it. Not exactly the description I read. When my dog tries to get comfortable on the bed, the cover slips off. The foam began chunking off w/in 1 week. It had an awful smell when it arrived that took at least 2 weeks to air out. I do not recommend this product as it is a waste of money."""
3,Not my idea of sherpa,"The cover is not what I call sherpa. It is not what sherpa looks like if you go to the Majestic webside and zoom in on the texture of the cover. It is soft but doesn't have the sherpa texture.Also, the bed comes in a box (from Majestic) folded in half. It took a couple of days for it to lay properly. I agree that this bed is very light weight. I am using it for 2 dogs that are each under 20 lb. Therefore, it is sturdy enough for them. I would not recommend it for a 50 lb. dog."
3,Neutral on this dog bed,"The cover is removable for cleaning but it is difficult to get back in place. The inside foam form is not real think so the sides bend over very easily. It really isn't strong enough to be a pillow, like the picture would lead you to believe."
4,Lounger Dog Bed(Extra Large),"My Goldens loved the bed and have to fight the cats and rabbit for lounging time.It does look like it will be a pain to put the cover back on after cleaning. For the price compared to what I saw at the big pet stores, this one is great and the four legged family members are thrilled."
2,MONEY WASTED,"My dog is almost 12 yr old and has some health issues and I wanted a new and more cushioned bed for her..I bought this bed and at first I was pleased because my dog took to it from the first day..The cover comes off for washing and I need that, but when I went to put the cover back on it, it wouldn't fit..I tried every way to get it on and I never did get it to fit without the foam bed folding up, leaving a 'hump' in the bed..The dog still sleeps in it, but now in less than a month of use, the foam bed is torn almost in half..I can't send it back, but I will never buy another bed without seeing it first..."
1,it looks better than what it is ...,I was disappointed with these beds (I bought two) ...very cheap material. :(
3,it's...OK?,"I ended up returning this book because I really didn't feel like it explained much at all except color combinations and basic supplies.I never did understand how to actually ""crochet a leis"".If you are looking for a book filled with color combination and hawaiian names for the leis....oh and sources for supplies on the islands... this book is likely a good book for you but if you need beginner instruction...pass it by"
3,better for experienced crafter's,better for experienced crafter's. quick shipping and woulddo business with them again.
5,Alice Faye Classic Video Movie,This movie is not made any longer on Video and is only available used. I was able to find it from this buyer. Excellent condition! My father in law will truly enjoy this classic movie.
2,Hello Frisco Hello,"This is a wonderful movie, I love this movie, if you like mucicals you've got to have this one. 1943, but its truly a classic. I saw it on T.V. and I just had to have it and you will too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,It just doesn't cut it ..... and that's being kind!,"This is not an erotica book ... it's a sex book with a super simplistic plot that has been done over and over and over .....I mean the main character, young 28 year old female in the UK, is struggling in the corporate world and even at that age like all of a sudden she realizes that everyone around her belongs to the Huxley club AKA swap club.... What happened to her in the previous years she walked around with blinders?Few if any of the characters are endearing, and the fact that the author has a penchant for men on men sex ... this doesn't even save the book ..Sorry it's a stinker ....."
5,Great baby toy!,"My 5 month old grandson loved these wood blocks. They are safe, interesting and perfect for developing motor skills, etc."
2,Zipper problems,"Purchased Leapster and case for Christmas 2005. Zipper broke last night (not even 3 months later). We have always been careful with the Leapster and case so it's not being tossed around. I saw one review that indicated it's a problem if you have a cartridge inserted when placing in the case. Maybe that's the problem but it didn't seem like that would matter. Case needs to be a tad bit bigger so there is not so much stress on the case. I'm going to give another one a try hoping it will be better. I really can't imagine not having a case to keep all the games, etc. together."
3,"Good for leapster, but not for cartridges","I agree that this is a good case for protecting the Leapster. My four year old son has had this case for a year, and even when he has dropped it, the Leapster is fine.My problem with the case is the pouch for cartridge storage. As other reviews stated, it is simply a small mesh pouch with a velcro flap over it. We have had cartridges fall out many times, and we have lost my son's favorite game because of this.If you are looking for a case to protect the leapster, this is fine, but if you want something to securely store the cartridges, you'll want to look for something else."
1,Not for Leapster L-Max,"I was shopping for my two grandchildren and purchased the L-Max. Was considering buying this case until I learned from the reviews that it would not fit. Kept searching and found the Leapsster L-Max backpack. It is about $19.99, is a small backpack, but large enough for the L-Max, games,etc. It keeps the game and accessories together, it is not too big and bulkey to carry around. It works great for us."
3,Needs a little re-engineering,"Great idea to protect the leapster...but I have to say that everytime that my 4yr has opened it the game has dropped out of the case.. it is almost like it is backwards. Also, the pocket on the back does not hold the game cards very well."
2,A lunchbox works better,"We looked carefully at these when buying cases for both our kids leapsters and decided on a simple lunchbox instead. It allows the kids to carry all their games, a spare set of batteries, the wall plug, AND their leapster all in one carrier. We've used this method for several months now and both kids (ages 3 and just 5) can open and close the cases easily. My son has the leapster game case, but we haven't gotten my daughter one of those yet and she's simply using an old walkman case to contain her games.AND... if they ever get tired of their leapster the case can carry something else (even lunch)."
2,No praise in Phoenix,Pictures were very disappointing....text was far too brief and offered little or no fishing advice. Access information was almost non-existant. No index. I returned the book.
5,Reliable Product,Bought this hole cutter for our business. I use it to cut soap dishes. The cut is clean and easy. I ordered two. Can't seem to wear the one I use out. Best product for the money.
1,Take some responsibility,"I'm more than a little offended at all the reviews that imply that liberals would like this stuff. I consider myself a real died-in-the-wool liberal, but give me a break. I don't know ONE family that has purchased a home during this recent housing explosion that moved because they wanted better schools. They want a bigger, fancier house - period. And they buy expensive SUV's, etc to go with it. Very low income families have trouble getting their kids to good schools; two income middle class families can afford places with good schools that won't put them broke. In fact, the house they moved from probably had schools just as good as where they're moving to. Geez..."
1,Misguided Research,"I have only made it through the first two chapters and am finding myself so annoyed I am not sure I will continue reading. Their theories on why people get into debt and declare bankruptcy are supposedly researched but I have never heard such crap in all of the research I have done on debt, bankruptcy, and consumerism. They claim that the debt does not come from buying more clothes, toys, cars, and eating out more often, (because, according to them, when you eat out more you buy fewer groceries??? I know personally that that is untrue.) but from buying a home in a good school district. Give me a break! I am really wondering about these authors. They act like they have come up with startling new evidence of why we are in debt, but I think they are making the whole thing up."
1,NO SOLUTIONS,"After watching the author on the ""Today Show"" I thought this book would give ideas to Middle-Class parents that could help them get out of financial trouble. Bottom line -- is that the Middle-Class should keep 1 parent at home, put moeny in a savings account and its o.k. to file bankruptcy.Instead of buying this book put your $26 in a savings account!"
4,Interesting read but doesn;t emphasis the main issue,"Compare the pre WWII family which had one employed member to today's two income family, look at where the money went then and where it goes today and one thing stands out in stark contrast: Taxes!. Yes, almost all of the second income is going to the increased tax burden imposed on people in this country since WWII. Income tax, sales tax, property tax, use tax, and so on. Let's put the blame squarely where it lies and then people can make an informed and deliberate decision about whether the large government at all levels is worth spending half of the productive capacity of our nation on."
2,Giving them more excuses...,"Sure two income couples have it rough. What about one income families? Retirees on fixed incomes? Single parent homes?I know housing is horrible. Try living in Atlanta and making a mortgage payment. Sure, insurance is going up. What about taxes???To hand people excuses doesn't help them. They need answers. Saying get a cheaper home won't fix the problem in many instances. It's like my Dad says, ""Watch the pennies and the dollars will take care of themselves.""It's the people out there with $100 cable bills and $200 cell phone bill who often (not always) have trouble paying the monthly note."
4,Interesting insight . . .,"This book provides some very interesting insights into some of the causes for financial stress in families. While I strongly encourage all adults to pursue fulfillment - professional, personal, spiritual, financial - the suggestion that intentionally seeking balance between all areas is worth the price of the book!I strongly recommend for people starting out - before the mortgage commitment!"
3,Some good points,"The authors make some interesting points, and do bring attention to the problems two-income families face, and the fact that many two-income families aren't getting ahead the way they would like to. For practical solutions families can use to improve their financial situation I recommend How to Help Your Husband Make More Money, So You Can Be a Stay-at-Home Mom by Joanne Watson, and budgeting books by Larry Burkett or his radio shows."
5,Enlightening,"We have generally save about 17% of our combined income; And my pay is about 16% of our overall income. The book recommended saving the income of the lowest paid spouse until you had a years worth of savings and I agree. The book really made me rethink what people ""waste"" money on. I now realize it isn't the single splurge of a night on the town or a single vacation but mostly the housing and education costs that get people into trouble. The things you can't cut back on when times get tough are the problem. You have to be able to afford at least all your monthly bills on one income. The book dispels long held foolish spending myths."
3,Watch out.....,"This book does discuss in detail the reasons for the financial quagmire that middle-class families are facing and possible political solutions for correcting many of the ills (162 pages). But, it does not spend adequate time discussing recommendations that middle-class families could use to help solve their financial issues. (18 pages). This book should be read by politicians and financial professionals, not middle-class families in crisis."
2,"Interesting premise, disorganized mess","There's no denying that there was an interesting premise for this book:Home prices and overall cost of living in America have risen because the norm is now both parents working--and since we all compete to buy homes, cars, etc. anyone who doesn't do that is out of luck.The problem is authors then spend 200 pages telling sad story after sad story, but they have fifty PAGES of end notes. I did this in high school on my term paper, to impress my teacher with the sheer volume of research I had done. But these ladies went to HARVARD?Bottom-line, this thing is an unbelievable mess that skips all over every subject related to increased competition for good homes. Frankly, I'm only finishing the last chapter to punish myself for buying a hardcover book without reading the reviews first."
5,5 stars for the show--NOT the price or slow releases,TERRIBLE what they are doing to gsmoke fans!!!!insulting!!! to think we are going to live forever and pay these prices for half season releases!im 67--got all epsidoes from ioffer.com for a fraction of the cost-(all 633 eps)--this way or no way--most are decent--my daughter--32 yrs old couldnt care less about gsmoke--and im sure the younger generation doesnt either--the studio will milk us till the 9th or 10th season and when we are all dead they wont be able give this show away -all they are doing is screwing us!! pure and simple--but if they wait too long they will get it in the end--i assure you--gunsmoke will NEVER see a season 20 release at the rate of release and price now
3,Some Celtic bands are better live...,"...and don't translate well in the studio. Tempest is like this. I've heard Tempest play a bazillion times, and I couldn't name a single band that is more exciting and fun to see live, but I find their recordings to be disappointing.Flogging Molly may be another band like this. I really wanted to like the CD, and admit that I was whooping for joy during Salty Dog, thinking that I'd found a real gem, but by the 6th track, the sound became tired and flat. To be fair, I gave it a second complete listen, then concluded that I really wasn't enjoying myself.The Scottish/Irish rock genre really needs more bands that truly kick butt(like the Wicked Tinkers, for example). Seeing FM live might change my mind, but based on this CD, I don't think they'd be one of them."
3,It's OK,Kind of a head banger style of Irish music. It's OK sometimes but won't be one of my favorite groups. Has some good tunes on it though.
5,good stuff,"my friend got me into flogging molly and now they are pretty much my favorite band. this entire album is great except for ""Grace Of God Go I"" which is somewhat boring. i would definately reccomend this, and the others, to anyone"
2,it's musically great - but lyrically and vocally very weak,"I was greatly looking forward to getting this CD, and swiftly disappointed upon listening to it a few times. Musically it's fabulous, but Dave King's thin, reedy voice coupled with lyrics so bad they're occasionally embarrassing unfortunately detract significantly from what should be a great listen. The one exception is ""The Worst Day Since Yesterday"" - King's voice is perfectly suited to this clever, poignant song. On the other hand, if you buy the album, you still have to listen to the end of ""Salty Dog"" in which the band (quite unfortunately) howl like dogs. All in all a bit painful, really."
1,Dissapointed,I like books that expose what the media does.. but this lady just talked about her family.. And rarely gave any advice... I feel kind of bad for making a review like this but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone! It did give like one interesting fact.. but other than that.. It wasn't a book worth reading. Mothers may like the book but I would of rather heard her expose stuff in the media and.. I didn't really get much out of this book so I stopped reading it cause I couldn't find much I liked.
2,Sliding,"I gave this pillow away. I tried to use it many times, but I always ended up at the end of the bed because I slid off the pillow all night long. It just doesn't work."
3,Linda D,"The pillow is as they say, but they don't tell you it is very hard, it is made of foam, I cannot lay on my side at all because my shoulders ache and on my back I keep waking up with my kidney area hurting, I tried the pillow for 3 weeks hoping it would soften up but couldn't take the aching any longer, I'm back to using regular pillows stacked up again."
3,Somewhat helpful.,"While I find this pillow to be somewhat helpful, if I were buying it now, I would get a higher one. I still need to put 2 pillow on top of it in order to be elevated enough."
3,AS ADVERTISED,"Wedge Pillow was exactly as advertised. Zippered carrying bag makes for easy transport of pillow. Pillow was ordered for my husband who has sleep apnea plus a shoulder problem. He has had considerable difficultly getting used to sleeping with the pillow. When he unfolded and used both sections of the pillow, it seemed like he was high on a cliff above me. He now is using only one section of the pillow and both of us are sleeping better. The wedge pillow definitely helps the sleep apnea."
3,"Very firm wedge, not a pillow.","Too firm for me to sleep on, so I stuffed it under my memory foam mattress. Now it does what it is supposed to do, elevate my torso. I still slide down some, but not too much."
3,Good for Acid Reflux But Not Very Comfy,"Got the Wedge about 2 weeks ago as I have been suffering from GERD for the past two years; I found it helpful in reducing my symptoms at night, but I started having neck pain and backaches, as I do not find the pillow very supportive or comfortable, and I felt some pressure points at the back of my head and my lower spine. So, I did some more research and I found a WONDERFUL wedge pillow - it's called the Prop-Up-Pillow ([...]) It's more expensive but it's worth it -it's made of memory foam, it has an adjustable neck and an adjustable lower back support, plus it's slightly wider than the Medslant. It was patented by a long-time acid reflux suffering patient. I am now using the Medslant to prop up my legs after a long day, but with the Prop-Up-Pillow I can now take care of my GERD and wake up well-rested."
2,Disappointed,"I was very excited to get this pillow due to the positive reviews. I was aware that it couldn't be returned, but thought it was worth the risk, because it sounded it was a product that would help me. I gave it a couple of nights try and ended up with a stiff neck and headache. I tried using a small pillow, a soft pillow, a crunched up sheet to fit my head but it didn't work. The company responded quickly to my complaint, but by the time I send it back and pay for shipping etc, I decided I would just take the loss and hopefully find someone that will have better luck with it than I did! I can't comment about the sleep apnea, or gastric issues because I couldn't use it long enough to find out. I think the premise is good, it just didn't work for me because of the hardness of the pillow. Plus where it ended up to the edge of my back, it was uncomfortable. I'm not saying it won't work for others,it just did not work for me."
1,CAUTION! Think twice befreo buying from this company!,"I just purchased this pillow and after using it several nights found that I slide down the pillow so far that I do not remain elevated. This pillow and the extra pillow case I ordered was $100.00 +. I feel like I have been taken to the cleaners, because they do not take ""returned"" items.So, think twice before you purchase from this company!"
1,shop arond,"Too tall and not returnable. Better off trying one at your local health supply store first before ordering this one online. I tried all MedSlant's suggestions and nothing worked. SO it did not work for me - no sleep, no help on the reflux."
3,Not for shoulder surgery patients,If you have had surgery to your shoulder(s) this may not be the pillow for you due to firmness and creating pressure on your shoudler. Each morning I awoke with shoulder pain and a headache. After several nights of trying this pillow my wife tells me it did not stop my snoring but it did reduce the noise level.I am sure it has promise for some - just not me.
4,Pillow to decrease acid reflux,"I have a severe acid reflux. My goal was to decrease my dosage of medication due to the harmful side effects. (With my doctor's assistance). I started using this pillow, changed my diet and have reduced my medication from 60 mg per day to 15! It will take time to get used to the pillow but you can do it if you are motivated. The pillow is comfortable and at a gentle incline. You are able to use a pillow for your head. It took three nights to sleep more soundly as I had to learn how to turn in my sleep without waking myself up. The best feature is the fold up design. It comes with a carrying case so you can take it anywhere you need to go. I would invest in this pillow if you are suffering from even mild reflux. You may be able to be medication free with your physician's help."
2,I wish there would be more choice at Amazon.com,"Poor converting quality, lack of such common devices as timer and tuner make such VCR a senseless purchase, especially after $100 price increasing. But if you constantly receiving foreign tapes, you may wish to try this VCR, though it feels more like a player."
1,Creators of Skeleton Key should sue,This film wasn't a legitimate film. It was a fan-made movie. I don't watch fan-made movies so soon as I saw what kind of film it was I turned it off and deleted it from my video history. If I could rate below one star I would. The play writer(s) of Kate Hudson's Skeleton Key should sue for ruining its good name.
3,"Not the best bubble wand, but still relatively fun","I ordered this toy for my two-year-old daughter because she has trouble with other giant bubble making toys. I thought it would be easy for her. It wasn't. The loop on the wand is supposed to ""click"" into place so that they can dip the wand in the tray. Well, it ""clicks"" into place... and clicks back out as soon as they lift it to make the bubbles, thus wasting the solution, hence, no bubbles. Neither my daughter nor I could get this thing to work. We were both very disappointed. We tried swishing it...nothing. On the upside, she likes to twirl the wand around and look at all the different colors on it. It is educational in that she is learning her colors by playing with it."
4,Good Soap,"At first I was harsh about this soap because I only used it on my face. However, when I used it on the rest of my body, I was quite pleased. Although, I still believe they can do without dye and fragrance. Overall its a good soap and it is better that Dove."
3,WRONG ITEM,"Don't get me wrong, the item is great. It's very soothing while bathing and smells AMAZING. The shipping was quick. However, this isn't the product I aimed to purchase. I thought the soap would be a dark brownish colour with all natural and no chemical ingrediants. I've used this soap for about a week. I don't see much of a change besides the scent is really loud."
4,Good purchase,I like this soap. was shipped on time & in good condition. Will certainly recommend the product.
1,Way too much static,There was way too much interference. We disconnected EVERY electronic and phone device in the house and still could not get a picture without static. Refunds were handled promptly.
1,Buyer Beware Manufacturing Flaws,Camera is very prone to interference. Fixed that problem by buying a new cordless phone system that operates at 4.8 GHZ. If you have a 2.4 GHz cordless phone do not buy or expect to replace your cordless phone. Secondly I purchased a two camera set and the additional camera had a very poor picture with a limited field of vision as compared to the first camera. Returned to Mobi and they sent a replacement which had the same problem. Next I sent them both the good and bad camera back to Mobi for diagnostic purposes and received back two NEW cameras. Now both NEW cameras are bad so now I no longer have a working camera. Buyer should be very careful about wanting to buy this product as I believe there equipment manufacturing has changed (made in CHINA) and the newer products are useless.
1,Be WARNED,"This wireless camera does not work if you have a wireless network, which is probably everyone using Amazon.com. I called the company and got a really poor repsonse to my inquires, they need to hire a new receptionist."
1,"no night vision, no color","We just received this product and the night vision does not work and the picture is only in black and white, not color as promised. Very dissapointed.UPDATE:I contacted MOBI directly and they had the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never, ever do business with them. Thankfully, Amazon was great and made it simple to return the monitor and they issued a complete refund immediately. Please do not do business with MOBI. I wish I could give zero stars but one is the lowest option. Pitiful product and CS."
1,Do not buy this!,"Don't bother buying this product. Any other product in your home that runs on 2.4 ghz will interfere with the reception. I even turned my wireless network off, and still received horrible reception and sound."
1,Mobicam a waste of money,"The mobicam system was purchased for me as a gift at my baby shower. The equipment worked okay for a few weeks. After that, I can barely see my son with the monitor sitting only five feet away from him. The static and interference are absolutely horrible. I can hear my son through my bedroom walls before I can hear it on the monitor. My set came with three cameras and two receivers. One camera does not even work anymore. Do not buy this item!"
2,Serious interferences with Wifi 802.11B networks,"It might be a great product in isolation but I confirm the feedback about interferences with Wifi 802.11B networks. The Wifi signal generates lines on the monitor screen and a clicking sound that continuously triggers the automatic voice activation. Conversely, the monitor's interferences prevented any communication among Wifi devices in home."
3,Not just for babies.....it's great for elder care as well.,"I purchased this system to monitor my grandfather's activity in the middle of the night. He gets up and roams around and I never knew what he was getting into...that is until I set up this system. I've got three cameras so that I am able to see if he's out of his bed and the other 2 cameras are in the kitchen at different angles.The low lux works very well, but I can't stand the hiss of the voice part of the monitor so I had to turn down the volume. I purchased a motion sensor from Radio Shack and strategically placed it between his chair and his bed. Whenever he gets up a buzzer (or clicking noise) sounds and I know it's time to check the Mobi Cam to see what he's up to.Yes...there will be interference with the monitor from time to time. The microwave causes unbearable static, but fortunately it isn't running all the time. There are also faint shadows that pass across the screen, but that doesn't matter so long as I can be sure he's safe."
5,Best Baby Monitor,"PROS:* It's great to be able to see your baby as well as hear what's going on. :)* Easy to reposition cameras and take the monitor with you* More than one camera linked to one handheld monitor. It's wonderful to be able to toggle between my two year old and 6 mo old napping in different rooms :).* Night vision provides a clear picture in low/no light* Great reception (at my house anyway :P)* Able to connect the monitor to the TVTwo minor things that could be improved:* I think it would be more helpful if the switches on the camera were on the back or top instead of the bottom so you don't have to pick up the camera everytime to turn it off or change the setting - or even better if you could control the camera (on/off/night vision) right from the monitor :)* You have to keep it plugged in if you want to use it all night. (not sure about the auto setting - don't really use it)If you're looking for a baby monitor, this is a great one - I bought it with an extra camera. :)"
3,"Okay, but with some problems","We ordered this camera for our 10 month old's room + an additional indoor camera for our 4 year old's room. It interferes with our wireless internet capabilities and we can't do anything online or email when the cameras are on, despite the channel setting. When one camera is on and the second one isn't, it works great. When they are both on, I get lines going across one image with a ""ghost"" image of the other camera blended in. I used to get a clicking sound, but that has gone away. I can't put the receiver monitor anywhere near the microwave or use my cell phone around it or it's complete static. So, I do use it but mostly at night when I'm going to bed and not using anything that might interefere. Hope this helps."
5,American Promise,i ordered this book new so it came in excellent condition and it arrived in like 1 1/2 weeks. all in all good experience.
3,A bit too short for me,I bought these because they make shirts stay tucked in and I feel that looks better than having a half untucked shirt. I received great service from the seller but the product was too short for my comfort.
1,Good for children,"I ordered these after being a little buoyed by some of the other reviews that sounded like these would be effective shirt stays.Unless your shirts go down to your midthigh or your socks go to just above your knee, the fact is that this shirt stays are approximately 10-15 inches too small even after adjusting to the current maximum length of (I measured) 17 inches.I still have the shirt stays I have been using for a couple of years and ordered these to replace and the ones I currently use are significantly longer and I don't have them adjusted out to their maximum length.I would recommend that unless they are for someone who is really short (for comparison purposes, I am 6 feet 2 inches tall), these will not be effective."
1,"Looks attractive, too bad they were DOA",These shirt stays looked like a great deal for under $10. They arrived really fast thanks to Amazon Prime. I open the package up to see what I was dealing with and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they soft and pretty easy to adjust. It was during this initial adjustment that one of the clips that is supposed to attach to the shirt just fell off. I didn't even get the chance to use them once! Thanks a lot for something that could have been awesome.
3,Description inaccurate,"I ordered these as I am now wearing a suit all day long and can't stand when my socks fall down (thick calves, you know). Upon receipt of these, I found that they could not clip on to either the shirt or the socks. They must be attached to buttons. I don't know about you, but my socks do not have buttons.The quality of the materials seemed to be very good."
3,Cheap,"If you have used shirt stays before, you will be disappointed with these. They come loose frequently and are cheaply made. I can't find the kind I used when I was in the military and hate having my shirt loose at work. Stay away from these because they are a hassle."
2,get what you pay for,I found this camera to be of poor quality. It's pictture quality is only clear for about 10 ft. After that you can tell what it is but not who it is! range? about 30ft.Night vision? What night vision. Receiver won't work more than 10ft. away from the camera itself.
5,"This one did the trick, Aquos has an odd mount patern","Bought a mount and a new Aquos. the vesa standard mount patterns are 100, 200, 400 mm, ect. this Aquos TV I bought is 440. So, I had to get a universal mount. I works great and is very well constructed, great hardware kit included and ok instructions. I had it up in a matter of minutes. How cool to have the tv on the wall."
5,boss pw10 wah,Good pedal. Lots of setting compared to a traditional wah. Has multiple wah types so you get a lot more that just one sound. Program settings are nice also.
4,Sturdy Brush,"Brush was bought following a recommendation from seminars aboard a cruise ship, along with other health and detoxifying methods. The brush was for sale on board for $44. Much better price here and its the exact same brush!"
1,not satisfied with the quality,Quality of the product is hopeless. From the third time I used it all of the fibers went flat and that rendered it not usable after that.
2,Decanter does not keep coffee hot,"Do not purchase this coffee maker if you are expecting hot coffee ,it comes out hot but the decanter is so cheaply made it does not keep the coffee hot.Purchase the VP 17 or the 392 model and purchase the 12 cup decanter with the stainless steel bottom if you are wanting a hot cup of coffee"
3,It's just coffee,This product was purchased for the lumber yard crew. It seems to be well made and is definatley faster than your average Mr. Coffee. It is fairly expensive for what it does so the telling factor will be how long it lasts. We are replacing a Bunn restaurant style coffee maker that we used for about 12 years untill the tank developed a leak.
3,"They were way ahead of the ""Curve"".","Amazing this is 13 years old, considering it would still blow away most anything similar today. Part of the alt/shoegazer crowd back in the day, Curve is really as much techno as anything else. Nearly all the tracks here have a pretty driving beat, and though Curve may not be quite as catchy as Lush were, they still toss in some good hooks. The stronger songs, ""Horror Head"", ""Ice That Melts The Tips"", and ""Fait Accompli"" are all excellent. The rest holds up well, and it's really a pretty consistent album. ""Cuckoo"" may be an easier listen, but ""Doppleganger"" is still better than most of garbage out there."
4,Challenging...yet fun and easy...,"I got this game a year ago and I've beaten the game about 20 times. It was sorta hard to get the hang of it when I first stared playing, which was while I was babysitting a little girl who had this game. She had beaten the first level (England), but was having trouble, so her brother helped out...needless to say, he sort of enjoyed the game too.The graphics aren't that special, and the story line is really pointless and lame, which is why I gave this product 4 stars. I think Vivendi Universal could have found a way to have the game be saved, instead of entering a password. But all in all, I guess this game is fun to play whien you're really really bored..."
2,"Not for the product, but the company.","I own this item, and purchased it from amazon. The product is great, but the company is so-so. the venturi injection on it arrived cracked, and split in half when i tried to put it together. the company quickly sent me a new one, which is a plus. I got it in two days...only to find out that when i set the whole thing up, another peice on it was cracked, and it leaked all over my floor. The item would be great, if it weren't for all the breaks in it. I'm about to call d&d and see if they can send me a new one entirely. If you're going to purchase this item, do it direct from the company (D&D) and not this AVI."
1,Love Bhangra but this video was awful.,"I tried this video because I love Bhangra. The audio is off, the dancers arent on beat, the moves are not very desi. If you want a good Bhangra Instructional/Workout Video try ""Bhangra Workout-1"" with Sat Pavan Kaur. Its really good."
1,Mastech Sinometer- Professional Bridge-Type 25,This item was recommended as being a very accurate meter. I found the operatinginstructions were inadequate. The Capacitance Scale read 2X what it should have. I was very disapointed in item performance. I expect the warrantee if there was one to be no good so I have written it off as a piece of junk. By the way this was my first purchase from Amazon and will probably be my last.
1,PREVIEW FIRST -- Bad lessons taught,"We were so excited to get this DVD because my 2 year old grandson loves his little rubber Thomas the Train engine. We started to view the first segment and were disappointed in the quality of the animation first of all, but then came the question to the viewer (most likely impressionable children) ""Can you think of a way that Thomas can trick the diesel engines because he doesn't like them?"" WOW! and it gets worse from there. Then further in the movie we expected that there would be some kind of reprimand or lesson about how bad it was for Thomas to do such a thing, but guess what -- that never occurred. We promptly removed the DVD from the player and threw it away. It would have been nice to know that this DVD contained questionable content inappropriate for young children. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.Thomas & Friends: Calling All Engines!"
3,lot of conflict and destruction & adverts,"It is so annoying to have to stand there for 5 minutes to make the DVD player skip all those adverts. It is somehow crazy, considering having paid for the DVD. I would pay more for one coming without adverts! Please anyone listen and offer them!The story describes the prejudice and conflicts between diesels and steamies, tricks they play on each other until the situation is completely messed up and they have to work together to still reach the common objective of building an airport and being useful machines. As such I think that it reflects what happens in real life, which is good as a learning experience. For my liking, there could be less emphasis on the conflict and also some other content. Our young toddler loves the DVD (possibly because it is the only train-featuring DVD we have?) and sometimes needs some adult assistance with 'digesting' destructive events and behaviour displayed in the story."
5,Great Chronicle,"Harold H. Martin, continuing the work of Franklin Garrett, offers a wonderful survey of Atlanta from 1940 to the mid-1970s. Martin selects anecdotes to beautifully evoke each period he discusses--Margaret Mitchell rallying recruits for World War II; youth reading comics in the basement of a church-sponsored hangout; gawkers driving to a hippie enclave in the late-sixties and early-seventies. Martin draws heavily, but not exclusively, from contemporary newspaper accounts to create a richly-textured chronicle. This is a vivid depiction of an era and a city."
5,Easy!,"Quick, easy, fun and durable.... This espresso maker will change the way you do breakfast or entertain company! Less mess to clean up -- simple to use and the end result is a great cuppa! Enjoy..."
2,"so so, can get stuck up inside","decent condoms for the price, the Trojan ribbed intense are better though or the lifestyles XXL, these are fine for the price, not bad, but watch out can fall off and can get stuck up inside"
3,Works okay,"This is my first folding saw and as these things go, it's clearly better than a knife for 4-6"" diameter wood. So for firewood collecting, this is great. Is it better than other folding saws out there? I have no idea. But it's built fairly well and the sheath is good, designed to hold both the folding saw and extra blade. All in all, a good to have item for hiking."
1,Gerber Saw,"The first time I used the saw to cut a 3 inch tree limb. The coarse blade broke in half. The saw itself is a little heavy, so I thought it was strong and well built. I didn't think it would broke so easily! I tried to order a replacement blade. The blade cost $7.18 and the shipping charges to Hawaii where I live is $23.25. With a total of $30.43. This price is almost $10 more than a new Gerber Gator with the two blades that comes with it. I don't think the replacement blade is worth the price."
4,Solid construction,"Great saw, somewhat heavy, but it will not split apart like the plastic version. However, the replacement blade they recomend does not fit this saw."
3,"Coarse blade good, fine blade not so good, HEAVY","The coarse blade cuts wood well. The fine blade lacks sufficient tooth offset, gums up quickly, and is pretty much worthless for cutting bone. The saw is sturdy and well designed but at over a pound, feels like a brick in a backpack."
4,Great activity table for pre-schooler,"My children have loved this table. It is large enough to give them their own space to play without bumping into each other. The drawers are great storage. I only wish that it came with (or you could purchase separately) longer table legs so that it could grow with my kids. My seven year old has to kneel down to use this table and my 3 year old is getting a bit big for it too. But, overall quality is great and the price was right!"
5,worked for me,"I love this stuff. I spent almost two weeks in Florida at the amusement parks, on my feet almost 12 hours a day. I rubbed the lotion in each morning and each night and didn't have any foot problems the whole time. The other people in my party developed blisters, in-grown toe-nails, etc., but I was fine. I attribute this (at least partially) to the quality of this lotion."
1,Didn't Work For Me,This product sure did not work for me. I've tried many products and was quite excited to try this one based on the reviews but it didn't do much at all. The product doesn't seem to stick and would still require socks to do much good at all.I have had much better success with Healthy Feet.
3,Hardly Miraculous!,"""Miracle"" is more than a stretch. This is a better than average foot lotion, but my feet weren't all that hard or cracked to begin with and this makes very little difference."
2,"Bland, electronic covers","The album contains a collection of bland, electronic sounding covers of REM songs by Studio 99. It is probably not worth your time, though if you like electronic sounds try the free songs for yourself."
2,Illusion of Usefulness,"The book only offers some insight into a realistic game production pipeline; it tries to cover subjects from ""Fun"" theory to BASIC to small Physics equations to Artistry.As an introductory book it is -ok- in these respects; however, I just suppose I found myself disagreeing with alot of the subject matter that is presented. Especially when it came to the design section, they try to put in the ""waterfall"" flow of design into game design which just seems too counter productive to be a realistic methodology for developing a game. Especially if you're only an 'entry' level designer."
5,Top Notch,Down to earth presentation of fun with a single tail whip in the world of SM. The Master explains how to approach this activity safely and informed.
1,Cuteness not worth the irresponsible message,"I really didn't appreciate this book's portrayal of anthropomorphic duck children ignoring a no-skating sign to much fun and no consequence. Sure, sometimes people imprudently ignore safety warnings without sustaining any physical harm, but that's not a message I want to emphasize to my preschooler."
3,good but not what i expected,"I love lawrence miles writings but, this book is like a comic strip encyclopedia and i dont like comic strips and if i wanted to read an encyclopedia i would go to the library to pick one up. I thought this book would be a novel about the war in heaven not an encyclopedia of random events with cartoon pictures thats for children or people with mediocre intelligence. i wanted a doctor who novel about the war in heaven which by the way is much more interesting and engrossing than the so called last great time war of the current doctor who series which russel t davies god bless him revised but seriously screwed up. Lawrence miles could have done better than this and the only reason iam giving this book three stars is becuase i like the concepts discussed in the book even though i dont like the way it was done. The other faction pardox works were novels that had depth and stories without the aid of cartoon pictures i wish this book had been a straight foward novel."
3,"pretty cool, but cheaply made","the 8ball detached from the chain during the first week that I had it so I had to fix it with superglue .. otherwise it's pretty cool and if you're looking for an 8ball keychain, this is it. It looks just like the pic"
2,Boring,"Last 2 albums have been stale. There have been a few good songs here and there but nothing great. I think this band need to get back to the ""Last Fair Deal"" and ""Tonights Decision"" style. They were realy sounding great on these"
2,PT's little brother...,"OH NO,not another Porcupine Tree clone!! Come on, find your own sound and don't steal some else's. This is also a rather monotonous cd, all the songs sound alike. To bad, they sound like they have some talent but instead are just PT wanabees."
4,"If you liked ""Mists of Avalon"", you'll enjoy this!","A playful retelling of the Arthurian legends from the point of view of a mischievous, bright young boy. Detailed and educational while telling a familiar story with unexpected twists and turns.Very easy to read and hard to put down!"
4,Not Her Best But I Ike It,"I can't honestly say that this is my favorite Jari Love workout. It is very different than her others. However, I will say that I got a good workout. It actually surprised me. It is a bit more ""dancy"" than her first videos. But, I was able to work up a sweat. I think I prefer Get Extremely Ripped and Get Extremely Ripped 1000. But, I think I will include this in my workout routine from time to time when I want something a little different."
2,Not one of her best....,"I agree with the other comments. I have 3 or 4 of the Jari Love Get Ripped/ Get Extremely Ripped and love them but was really disappointed with this one. I agree it is not 3 30 minute workouts. You start to cool down on the first one around 22 minutes in. It felt very disjointed and thrown together. I did not sweat nearly as much as I do in her other workouts. The music was not bad and there were a couple of decent arm workouts but they were quite repetitive. Just as an FYI, I would consider myself high-intermediate or advanced in terms of fitness level and work out 5-6 days a week; usually with boot camp but use the DVDs when I cannot make it to boot camp. She did have more (and better) abs then in some of her prior DVDS. All in all, my least favorite of her workouts."
1,READ FIRST,"READ THIS FIRST BEFORE BUYINGI have not bought this product but I read all the reviews and was a bit disappointed because it seems no one knows that the round heart shape waffle iron is not a novelty to be used for Valantine's Day in place of a regular waffle iron. The shape and depth of the iron is specific for making Noregian waffles which are not meant to be crispy like American waffles. They are meant to be thiner and more like a chewy pancake in texture. This is due in part by the iron and part by the waffle batter. Look up a good Norwegian waffle recipe and use that with one of these irons. The French may have the crepe but, the Norwegians have perfected the waffle (oh and btw, it's usually served cold but it's excellent warm too)"
5,epic.,i really love the photo references especially in reference to the text. this is a book about some of the darker edges of fashion and designers ideas. delves much more into the artistic side of fashion. broken up into aptly interesting titles as well as tight ideas well expressed. im really happy i bought this. one of my fav purchases in recent history.
2,Disappointed,This product took about a month to get to me. Once I got it the poster was fine - but the picture frame was cheap and actually cracked on one side. It didn't even have glass for the cover it was cheap plastic. I had to go buy another frame. Will not purchase from this company again!
3,In the way,Great idea but it ends up being in the way. I use it anyway but am constantly working around it - too bad!
1,Big and Bad...,"I'm not pleased with this toaster. I figured if I spent a little extra to get a nice toaster it would be a vast improvement over the ... toasters I've worn out. Here's what I don't like... The slots on the toaster are wide but not very long. If you like toasting country style bread it doesn't fit, you have to push it down. For such a big toaster I would have thought that it could handle any reasonable size bread. The toasting is badly uneven. I like toast on the dark side and use the darkest setting on the toaster. The toasting result is slightly dark on one side and vastly underdone on the other side. Other qualities of the toast are the bottom 1/4 inch doesn't get toasted due to the bread holder. Lines on the toast are fairly large from the metal strips in between the toast and the heating elements. So if you're thinking about spending extra to get a nice toaster, keep shopping."
1,toaster broke within 2 weeks of purchasing,the pop-down knob for the toaster quit working within 2 weeks of purchase. There is no customer service number to call and inquire about this problem. The toaster looks good but how useful is an attractive toaster that doesn't work.
1,Classic Toaster Problems,Great looking toaster. Matches our other appliances very well. We have been very disappointed with the quality. The knobs fell off within a week. The slide bars do not stay down and there is no adjustment for this. No customer service department for help. Buyers beware!
2,don't buy this,From the beginning this toaster did not toast evenly. After a year of use one of the red switches broke in half. Called company for replacement info and they offered no solutions.
3,Good for Reference,"As a total beginner I was a bit disappointed in this book. The instructions are not that detailed, and seem to assume you have some basic knowledge. The patterns are good and there are some more advanced stitches explained I'm sure I will appreciate later, but I would not recommend it as a ""starter"" book."
1,Doesn't Hold Up,"I bought this ""Smoothie Bar Blender and Server"" and used it about 15 times before the plastic dispenser cracked making the whole thing unuseable. I was very careful with it, washing it by hand - not putting it in the dishwasher - because I thought it looked fragile (cheap) when I first opened the box. Don't waste your money on this item."
1,5 Thumbs Down for the 5785 Blender,"I don't want to be seem like I am piling-on, but all of the bad comments above or correct. This is just simply not a good unit to purchase. We have had all of the problems, the worst being it always leaks from the bottom. Many times when you place th pitcher into it and twist to lock it down you are actually loosening it on the bottom to cause leaks. Thick products will not come out of the spout very well even if running the motor and on top of all those items the bottom locking tabs that holds the cutter in place all broke off making it useless. Even though you think it might still be worth only $30 you will find it hard to get your money worth before it breaks."
5,Best Wildflower Propagation book!,"I've owned this book for over 15 years and still give it as a gift to anyone interested in wildflower propagation. It is my best resource and the methods have worked in my own garden. It covers plants not just in the southeast but those that are native to the northeast from Maine, through lower Canada, south to GA and west to parts of the Great Plains, and up to Illinois---quite a large region. A few plants have cousins or populations in the NW and CA, too. Yes, it is written in NC but many plants (not all), are native to about 1/2 of the U.S. His advice could be adapted if plants emerge and ripen earlier or later. I also use William Cullina's Growing and Propagating Wildflowers of the U.S. and Canada (that taught me that trillium seeds and many others need to be rinsed first). But, this Harry Phillip's book is my favorite. I have drifts of wild ginger, bloodroot and even trillium all grown from seed. Thank you, Harry!"
3,Grammiecantoo,"A wealth of information but, for a novice, photographs instead of drawings would be more helpful."
3,Not Bad,"I have been listening to, and loving Iron Maiden's music for some time now. But I wouldn't recommend people to buy this cd. There isn't anything wrong with it, just that it was a very early work made before the band helped define the speed metal sub-genre with lightning fast riffs and throaty vocals."
1,WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP!,"After I bought this item, it worked fine until a couple months later it wouldn't display a single thing! I tried calling the company but they said that the repair would be out of my pocket! This item is a disgrace to the computer monitor industry! DON'T BUY IT! BUY A SONY OR SAMSUNG INSTEAD!"
5,Love these glasses,"Very cool sunglasses, they look great. They are polarized, so make sure your car's display will not get washed out while driving. Exactly as described. No issues with delivery."
1,Too good to be true!,"All was good, ordered on October 12, arrived on October 21, product looked perfect until the next day where I noticed a screw was missing .. See i had the very same sunglasses so I thought it may have been my fault the previous evening so no big deal I had the same srews in the old pair right? Wrong wasnt my fault the screws dont hold in that spot .. Not even screws from the same pair they sent me .. If I send it back it will cost me $10-$20 or i could bring it to a jewelet to fix that's what i did ... Shame on you eyewear .. This won't be a profitable business for long."
1,rosie suks!,"out of all the lesbians i have a great deal of respect for, E.G amanda bearse, judy tenuta, ellen degeneres and a few others whom names i cannot think of at the moment, in my neck of the woods rosie o'donnell gets the most labeled as a fat-headed, obese left-wing (i do so very much oppologize for the use of this word>) ""dyke"". she was supposed to have her own show on msnbc but would not shut up about it and the networks brainstormers shut down the concept. i am glad they did. rosie o'donnell is a purist bully and irritant."
2,"Not bad, not bad. But not great.","I imagine Rosie O'Donnell's fans would adore this book. She's honest and insightful, blending an incredible story of a long-distance friendship that isn't what it seems with her own painful memories of her childhood.If you're not a big Rosie O'Donnell fan, but maybe just interested in pop culture or memoir, it's still a fine book. It's full of humor and is a quick read.It doesn't try to be something more than it is, and that's how it works so well. It's hard to dislike a woman who has been through so much, who wants to help others, and who realizes her own problems are what drives her desire to help.If you're a fan, you'll love it. If not, there are worse books to read if you want to pass some time."
2,Love Her...eh on the book,"I actually listened to the book on tape due to the fact that I am in my car waaaay too much. I had the unabridged version, and I just didn't like the way that the book flowed. It jumped from place to place way too much and I thought the book was going to be more about her and her life rather than this fictional character."
3,not what I expecteD,"everyone has so many great reviews of how this book reveals so many secrets about Rosie's life. I was interested in the fact that she ""comes out"" in the book but that is barely mentioned at all. In fact the only mention of it is of her girlfriend Kelly once. I expected huge secrets but there really wernt any. The ending was also a let down. No big secrets revealed or revelations. It just kind of stopped. The book was an interesting read and Rosie is a creative writer with a fun prose style. The book didnt really have a clear goal or plot line it just seemed to be a lot of rambling. I might have liked it better if I hadnt expected so much from all the great reviews."
5,Rare Commodity - An Emotionally Honest and Brave Woman,"While she may not be the most emotionally independent women, much of Rosie's success is that she has always been - all woman - by virtue of the fact that she is not only willing, but shameless, of revealing the emotional honesty that exists so rarely in the revelations of women today. Her bold approach enables women everywhere to idolize her courage, her honesty, and the unusual perspective of a woman willing to be herself, come hell or high water. Sensitive to her environment but willing to chance the high level scrutiny that can arise from her vulnerabilities, she boldly marches on building her own fanfare from empowering other women to be themselves in celebration of their intelligence, their intuition, and their life experience. A tough woman, beloved, and original to those who can appreciate her rare qualities, unsubdued and unapologetic. A model of intellectual liberation of great consequence; a real treat for other women!"
2,give snaps for writing but...,"I bought the book for my ex girlfriend when it came out... I bought it from an antique shop for 5 dollars, right after it came out. That should've been a bad sign from the get-go, but i bought it anyways because my at the time girlfriend was a big a fan of Rosie.I read it in the car on the way to Houston and it was no where close to what I expected. I was greatly disappointed. I was setup for a great book and instead of caviar, i got some bad tuna.The book goes on and on about a girl named Stacie, and then zaps you into O'Donnell's childhood. Iit made it slightly difficult to follow.The media set the book up as if it was a wonderful coming out story (seeing how at the time she had just recently come out of the closet), but no, the story was about Stacie.I was very disappointed. Had the story been advertised for what it is, I probably would have enjoyed it."
1,Unexpectable,"This book was one of the weirdest books I have ever read. Rosie did not write a very good book, I was expecting it to be about her coming out as a lesbian, and struggles through her life, not about some girl named Stacie, or Melanie whatever her name is"
5,Livens Christmas,The Beach Boys are more for a Christmas party than for listening to in front of the fire on Christmas eve. Good to get the kids going.
3,DISSATISFIED,I JUST THROW OUT THE VILLAWARE PIZZELLE BAKER. IT DOESN'T HEAT EVENLY AND PIZZELLE WERE BURNT IN THE CENTER. THEY ALSO STUCK. I DID NOT CONSIDER THIS A NONSTICK PRODUCT. DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT AND WILL LOOK FOR ANOTHER BRAND TO PREPLACE IT.
5,"80 years later, it's still a very good analysis","Although written during an earlier part of the 20th century, Atwood's analysis is one of the better and more historically-compatible attempts to show the true intent of the U.S. Constitution. He does this by analysis of the amendments as if they were used to modify the language in the main body of the document itself. The differences in legal analysis brought by this approach becomes readily apparent and exists in stark contrast to the dubious results that have taken root from the more conventional ""living document"" (which is actually a ""dead document"") approach applied by the comtemporary legal thuggery known as the U.S. Supreme Court."
3,Does not match T-mobile MDA well,Compared to the original cell phone case which comes alonge with the cell phone (T-mobile MDA) this case is not good because of its small size. However it is possible to squeeze T-mobile MDA into this case but I would not recommend to experiment this with your T-mobile MDA. I gave 3 because this cell phone case might be perfect for other cell phones.
2,Not much info included,"I love brevity - gimme what I need, no flash, no flowery language and I'm happy. So, when I saw this book it seemed perfect. Unfortunately, each section is too brief. Example, we get less than half a page on Myceane cities, ditto with Crete. Ancient China? Again, just half a page.The info presented is good and valid, but not much more than you'd find by the first paragraph of a wikipedia entry. I'm not too sure who this is geared for, but I can see this being great for an early high schooler with the help of a dictionary."
1,"No Depth, No Insight","Normally, I don't mean to be harsh. I also hardly ever write book reviews, but Mr. Kotkin's the City was so disappointing I felt a duty to warn others.I should have been tipped off by the book's short length, but I only thought that Kotkin would therefore leave out a lot in favor of threading together an interesting thesis. Kotkin goes the other route, trying to stuff in as much as possible and therefore actually saying very little.The author seemingly attempts to discuss every major city in the history of mankind. The bibliography starts on page 161 so there is very little room to do so.With the chapters so short and divided so frequently, Kotkin could have gotten the same effect by asking a bunch of high school students to do a short (but admittedly erudite) summary of a major city. Put those together and you have this book.Terribly disappointing for someone hoping for depth and substance."
4,Pizelle Maker,"It was a little hard at first to get the pizzelles to look pretty, but it was because I used the thin batter and it was my first time ever using an iron. However I made the thick batter and that was so much easier for me to make prettier pizzelles' <smile> The recipe book that came with it was great, all the cookies were delicious even the ones that didnt look so pretty =) Clean up was a breeze, just wipe with a paper towel and it is clean =)"
4,Worth the purchase,Opened my thought process on other styling and colour options.Useful if you are looking for ideas on decorating outside the usual.
2,A great tent for relatively dry camping,"Overall this is a decent two-man tent. If you're going solo, you have plent of room for sleeping and gear inside of the tent. With two, the vestibule gives you a fair amount of space for backpacking gear.I've camped out in this a number of times in snow, rain (light and heavy), sleet, and fair weather so I've put it through some trials.The vestibule design is a little aggravating because when it's raining, the overhang is so small that it allows rain to get into the tent. Also, the zipper is all the way at the end of the canopy and it difficult to reach without rubbing against the canopy, again another issue when it's raining or snowing.On our last campout, I started to have an issue with the seams stretching and subsequently leaking at the corners.So, if it's fair weather, light raing, or snow, I don't mind using this tent at all. However, when it comes to fowl weather, I've started shopping around for a replacement."
1,Still looking for a different tent,"My boyfriend and I used this tent for a 1- month bicycling and camping trip. We had previously had the Eureka Backcountry, a very similar tent.We did not like the way the vestibules were designed. If it is raining hard, and you want to get into the tent, then opening the vestibules will allow rain to get inside the tent through the mesh doors. This is a fine tent is you are only a fair-weather camper, but if you camp in the rain or if you go on long trips where it might rain some day, beware.Our previous tent was better - the old Eureka Backcountry had zip-up solid panels on the mesh on the door.We did like the way the Apex has two doors, but we are going to look for a tent with a better design."
3,"Reads like a reference list, not a book","This indeed is a comprehensive book on the professional field of art therapy. But is reads like one long reference list and is a book that actually turned me off to the field of art therapy rather than inspiring me to find out more. It seems that the author has listed every possible reference to the field of art therapy in this volume and every possible historical reference. At the end I was still left wondering, what is art therapy? This seems like a great book to have in a college library collection as a resource, but frankly, otherwise I found it turgid and boring."
2,Very inaccurate,I tested the gauge to a standard and it was over 10 psi off and non-linear. I ended up buying a Stewart Warner gauge which was very accurate and linear.
2,gauge failed after two months***,"this gauge worked fine for about two months and gave very precise readings..... then one day the needle gradually went further and further down.....until it said ""0 pounds""........ buy a decent oil pressure gauge.....don't go to the trouble to install this piece of junk.....11/06/11 update: I've since found out that motorcycles require liquid filled gauges. The vibration is too much for a standard gauge. Nevertheless, this gauge would still have failed on a racing car application."
3,surprisingly sloppy fit,.. even on their hole saw own blades.I wonder whether another arbor (e.g. Dewalt's) would be more confidence-inspiring.
4,Excellent gloves,"I've Giordana Strada gel gloves on and off for about 4 years. Whenever I try other gloves I return to these: I cycle every day, nearly 9500 kilometres per year, and this gloves are comfortable and take the beating."
4,Great delivery from Peach!,"What can i say... Are you looking for naked beautiful girls? You got it. Girl on girl action? Not so much, more of them just posing, some petting, not so much spreads, and no passion. Atmosphere? Really good. State of the art picture? No, but nice picture, far above average. Good music? I liked it. Extras? 4 previews of other Peach DVDs and a photo shoot really nice. Recommended buy? Yes, I think they do a good job with this, better than most Peach titles."
5,Its amazing...,"I didn't think there was anything I didn't know about slavery in America but I was wrong. As an African American, there was times I had to put the book down because of simmering anger over the harsh institution of slavery. Hannah says on more than one occasion she seen no worth in slaves marrying only to be sold away from each other or to promote slavery by having more children produced from the marriage. Never before had I put the two together in thought, marriage and slavery. I finished the book and consider it good reading and excellent research notes."
5,Model Railway Encyclopedia,"This is a British book and is strictly about modeling their railroads, but as a longtime model railroader I found it highly interesting. Because the book is over 60 years old, the techniques are very dated, though many are still useful."
2,Not very handy to install or use...,"This unit unfortunately includes a ""security"" feature which means that hardware must be tightened using an enclosed ""wrench,"" which is both cumbersome and totally impractical. The tilt system on the unit is not as easy to use as on other units, and adjustments must be made on both sides of the unit, requiring two people to access this feature. Peerless does make the same unit without the ""special wrench"" feature, and I would go out of my way to get that one next time."
3,"Three stud mount needed for larger, or not centered studs","Unit comes with a two stud mount, I am mounting a 60 LG plasma and feel I need Peerless part 200-1901/2. I am finding out that part is about $45 plus shipping. Not available on Amazon and not available retail. Am in the middle of mounting the tv and now I have to wait....something I don't like to do."
3,Not Quite,The product isnt quite what they say it it. Really doesnt tilt the way I wanted and I even had to modify it a little to work the way I wanted. Overall it works just fine but this whole ONE TOUCH TILT is a lie bc it really doesnt tilt at all. All things considered its a good deal for the price.
4,"Good frame, beware of instructions","Good frame and hardware. Fit my Panasonic 46"" plasma perfectly. However, the instructions almost led to an installation error. The instructions stated that the top mounting bolts of the frame should be measured at 6.2"" above the center of the screen. Luckily, I decided to mount the brackets on the TV, then put the frame on while the TV was on the ground and measure to the top of the TV from the top of the frame. There was 2"" more to the top of the TV then when following the 6.2"" instructions. If I would have mounted the frame as originally measured, the screen would have been 2"" too high. Please take my advice and measure out the actual distance with the frame on the brackets before you hang the frame."
5,EASY!,"YOU'LL BE WATCHING TV IN NO TIME! EASY TO INSTALL, DURABLE, HOLDS OUR 46"" LCD. THE DESIGN IS GREAT, MOUNTING IS NEAR FLAT AND NOT VISIBLE IN ANY WAY. IT REALLY TILTS WITH A TOUCH! RECOMMENDED!"
5,Great mount,"Worked perfectly on my Samsung 52""...had all the parts i needed.....set it up and mounted it in no time at all!! It did have great adjustments on the back too just in case your mounting isn't level...mine was off about an 1/8 of an inch, which was easily corrected on the back of the mounting unit!Great product at a great price.....i couldn't be happier with all the audio/video equipment that i've purchased through amazon!!"
3,Different,Its a long time since I read Nancy Drew. This one was scarier than others that I have come across and there was a good twist with the scarecrow
3,"grilliing OK, waffles disaster","Although the surface is ""non-stick,"" my waffles always stick. Imagine scraping semi-baked dough out of the myriad crevices. Perhaps I need to find a recipie with the right balance of moisture and oil.It does take a long time to warm up, and it seems that only the Hi setting reaches an adequate setting for most cooking.had fun making grilled cheese and panini."
5,Thank goodness you can still find these!,"The perfect body brush--this angled handle is the only one to really facilitate reaching everywhere comfortably in bath or shower. No stores seem to carry them anymore! And what a fabulous price for a well-made, medium-soft bristle brush that doesn't shed its bristles, that rinses clean, that lasts and lasts."
2,VillaWare V3900 Krumkake Baker,"I am disappointed with this baker. The batter did not stay in the circles,but ran together in the middle. Also the cookies were not round as they are supposed to be, but oval. I have an older Vitantonio baker that works much better."
4,Perfect KrumKate,"I love it so much! It is so easy to use and the Krumkate came out very thin. However the product is ""made in China"" not ""made in USA"" as indicated under its description. I experienced that the cookies came out rather dark, so I used a timer instead of waiting for the light. It will take approximately one minute and 45 seconds for each cookie. I set mine as one minute and 25 seconds. If you want a thin krumkate, your batter should be thin. The thinner, the faster it will take, so adjust your timer accordingly. It is easy to clean with a dam towel or paper towel"
4,Ugh,I bought the book to read for extra credit. This book isn.t for the beginning reader. Make sure you have time to understand the concepts if you ever plan to use them or explain them
2,Chick Lit,"Some women might term this a horror novel due to subject matter; at fifty, Lu expects The Change, not all the changes she finds herself facing. Her new editor is a snide, condescending, not sweet young thing; her husband wants to trade her in, and one night of passion results in a baby. Abortion is never even considered as Lu handles all her challenges and changes with aplomb and humor. Her experiences bring new love and new chances to help others facing difficulties. Through it all, she laughs to keep from crying, giving new definition to the term midlife crisis."
1,A complete waste of money. Keep looking!,This book is horribly out of date and doesn't even work with Microsoft's latest compiler. This one didn't have a single useful chapter. There are many other books (even some poorly written ones) that would be a better buy.
2,Out of date. Not a great book by any means.,This book deals with ancient versions of Visual C++ and is useless today. It provides neither a sound introduction to windows programming or a smooth transition from other tools to Visual C++
3,"Great size, but at the expense of picture quality","PROS: the worst picture is the one not taken, and with it's size you can always have this camera with you. The large rear-screen is nice. the camera has a ton of features and settings, so many that it takes some time to scroll through them to find the right one for lighting conditions. CONS: It is not really ""point and shoot"", if you have a fast moving subject or challenging lighting conditions, you have to take some time to find the proper settings, or you get a blurred or grainy picture. the large screen pushes the control panel to one side, which is then difficult to grip without hitting a button unwillingly."
2,Try another book,This book is pretty weak. To begin with it needed more editing just for its grammar. And the contents are not very rigorous.
1,poor design and poor product support. not worth the money,I have had this appliance for a couple of years. So far I used it for grilling once. It did not drain the meat juice well and it spilled all over the place. I have used it to make waffle 4 times and every time it was difficult to remove the waffles even though i coated it with non-stick spray on the non-stick grids. I followed the suggested handling and cleaning instruction and have been careful not to spoil the coating. the last time I used it I noticed that a lot of non-stick particles came off into the waffles. I had to throw them out. now the alluminum grids are very much exposed and flaky. I called their customer service and was told that I could not buy replacement grids nor would they repair them for me even for a fee. Right now this waffle maker is useless.
1,Soft waffles is all it makes!,"I had this product for a few years now, and have only used it a dozen times or so. The reason why is because I have never been able to get it to make crisp waffles. No matter how long I let it cook, it usually takes at least 11 min. just to cook a waffle that is soft. It will not cook a crispy waffle at all.The other problem is that I have to coat it with massive amounts of Pam, or oil, and even then they will stick frequently.So, I finally got sick of soft waffles, and fighting the thing for them! I just did the right thing and threw it in the trash, where it belongs!"
1,A Huge Disappointment,"I wore out my old waffle maker and was excited about the versatility of this machine. While the non-stick surfaces are easy to clean, the baking time is incredibly slow and the cooking is uneven (one side will be very brown while the other side is barely golden). I chose a waffle maker that would make four waffles because I want to make enough for the whole family to eat at the same time; but by the time the second four are ready, the first batch is cold. This is with the machine set on high and if you try to rush you end up with the waffles separating in the middle and waffle in both of the baking grates. This is a pain to get out. The machine body is also rather bulky. This waffle maker is the reason I am shopping for a new waffle maker."
1,I finally tossed mine in the trash where it belongs!,"I've owned this alleged waffle maker for years now. About once a year I break it out to make waffles. The one I have heats fine but the non-stick surface it terrible. I've tried the spray-on vegetable coating and even brushing the hot plates with vegetable oil and nothing works. I have tried different type of waffle batter and still nothing works.After I get frustrated and clean the waffle maker up I usually put it away until the next year. But not any more, off to the trash it went. It may be good for some other uses, but a waffle iron that won't make waffles in my opinion is useless.Even though I've shopped on Amazon since the beginning this is the first review that I've written. I've checked the past review of this product and found a ""Top 10"" reviewer that gave it 5 stars. Of the more then 1600 reviews that she gave, all where 5 stars. She is either extremely lucky or full of the stuff that my ex-waffle maker made."
1,Poor Quality,"Grill did not get hot enough to cook pancakes. The non stick coating is flimsy and flakes of easily. Too bad, because I really like this type of grill as it is easier to store than a regular griddle and is also good for making grilled cheese sandwiches. I replaced it with a Black & Decker that works very well but is not as large."
4,Flashcards for beginners,As I am beginner I can't recomend this product for beginners for learning. This is too much difficult - it's really good idea to start with Volume 1 :-)) But the style of it is excellent.
1,Not worth it!,What you get is a comforter of bad quality - that's it!There is no pillow case like on picture.
5,Listen My Children.....,"By far the most comfortable and sturdy earbud style phones I've found particularly for the price. They're comfortable for long listening sessions and have great sound. I haven't tried these with an amp yet but that would probably enhance them with a mp3 player. Recommended HighlyUpdate 7-1-2009The more and longer I listen to these, the better I like and appreciate them. Great audio quality, extremely comfortable even if I fall asleep with them in my ears and no durability problems at all. Would buy another pair immediately if mine were lost or stolen.I noticed the current price on the item in the review was way more than I paid for mine so shop around."
5,Great sound!,I love these headphones.. beats my ipod standard issue anyday. I've read some reviews of the flimsy contruction but so far its been a month and its ok. I agree you do need handle it with some care... meaning don't crumple it up in a ball and expect the wires not to be damaged.. overall i'm happy so far..
1,Just like lighters -- great... until they go wrong!,"They are pretty nice looking, and sound fine, but they went mono after a few weeks, and completely dead after another week. I can get headphones that last longer for a dollar at Wal-Mart. They might look and sound great, but only for a few weeks! Also, they don't make good on their warranty, saying that online receipts don't suffice for proof-of-purchase. AVOID!"
2,"Great Sound, Poor Construction","To begin, the sound quality of the enclosed earbuds (v-moda Vibe Earbuds) is impressive (sound alone wouldn't necessitated four stars). I was pleasantly surprised upon first listen.However, the ostensibly sturdy construction of the product proves to be illusory at best. Not after just days of proper use the fabric sheath surrounding the wire which connects the right earbud to the plug began to fray at the metal crimp; so much so that the black plastic wire became visible. But more to the salient point, not weeks after receipt of the earbuds (product was received mid to late March) the left earbud separated from its foundation. The two portions separated at the seam seating the smooth metal housing to the rougher, gripping metal ring. This rendered the earbud practically unlistenable. Hopefully the manufacturer will meet the terms of the one year warranty and send a new pair. And hopefully the second pair has a longer listening life."
5,EXCELLENT EARPHONES EVER,"I just received my v-moda today. I was too eager that I couldn't wait to test it. I have to say there's a big big big difference when it was burned in. The sound is more crisp, clear and deep. The bass is much more better than right out of the box. This is a must-buy if u want to shop for a pair of earphones with reasonable price."
3,"Great, while they last","Like others that have reviewed these earphones, I loved them when I first got them and as long as they lasted. After normal use (walking and gym) the wires got a short. V-Moda was very prompt about resolving the problem but the second pair did the same thing. I see they've dropped the price to 60. but even that is too much for something that lasts for three months."
1,Wire broke the first day,"The wire broke the first day I used it. It was on the iPod end,just a small jerk and the rubber on the jack separatedand lost one channel unless you pushed on it. Useless!"
4,"great item, but arrived filthy","I ordered this to replace 2 Rubbermaid spoonulas I've had for over 10 years and the edges were finally chipping. This replacement appears to be the same great quality as my old one, but I was very disappointed in the condition it arrived...covered in dirt! There's no plastic packaging around the item...looks like it has been taken out of some dusty bin in a warehouse. Had to scrub to get the dirt off...it didn't wipe off easily. Not exactly what I expect when purchasing a food prep item."
4,Creativity in Prose and Form,"There are lots of words to describe Banks and his work (both as Iain, the fiction author and Iain M., the science fiction author) &#65533; creative, imaginative, surreal, bizarre, thought provoking, occasionally twisted. All are appropriate and easily applicable to Walking on Glass.As previous reviewers have mentioned, the construction of the book is odd &#65533; each chapter is divided into three parts, each following a different story line. Each is very intriguing on its own and, until the end, these lines seemingly have little to do with each other. While it can be maddening trying to find a common thread and hard not to just skip ahead to figure it all out, the scenes that Banks sets up are irresistible.It&#65533;s difficult not to like this book, or at the very least be intrigued. Unfortunately its difficult to find in the United States but easy to order from the Amazon UK site. And well worth the extra shipping costs."
4,Confusing but intriguing,"Three lives seemingly separate but brought together cleverly at the end. Like many of Banks' books, full of imaginative prose and lots of indiscrepancies, even after reading it 3 times! Not an easy read, but worth the effort"
2,Over my head I'm afraid,"I found this book confusing,frustrating and couldn't wait to finish it. At the end I was hoping for all to be revealed but just saw some weak links between the characters - Grout causes Slater's (aka Stock) motorbike to crash by putting sugar in the tank and then promptly gets hit on the head by a beer barrel after Slater crashes into the brewery wagon. Duh? Presumably Grout and Quiss are dead and in hell, after finding out how Sara has shafted him, Parks wishes he was there too."
1,The Horrible Minnie and Moo (a student's review),I wish I could give it -100 stars. This is the worst book ever! You shouldn't waste your money on it. You have to be a baby if you read Minnie and Moo. I'm a third grader and I thought it was too boring for me. Maybe a first grader would like it.
1,Easy to attack a man who is dead.,"I think its easy for some people to have an axe to grind. There is still a puritan belief hanging around that out of sight and out of mind really means something does not exist. Don't talk about it, except in abstract context, and compartmentalizing subjects that will or won't be debated, because they don't exist. In some peoples minds, there is only one way to think. Hardly scientific. The rub seems to be that Kinsey did talk to and record people, regardless of who or what their sexual habits might be. I find that much more informative than the Hoover approach. If more research was done, we might not have so many people in prison that are supposedly beyond redemption. One way to help the human condition would be to accept it exists for various reasons, and learn why, instead of simply condemning people."
2,Non-stick coating peels again,"My widowed mother-in-law badly needed a pan to use in her toaster oven and was delighted when I found this little Nordic Ware casserole pan; it was the perfect size. Within a month, however, the black non-stick coating began to peel in dime-size circles. She never puts anything in her dishwasher and is a diligent rule-follower -- I know this was not something she caused. I have no doubt Bed, Bath & Beyond will replace it, but it doesn't look like there are any other choices. I would much prefer to buy her something heavier and well made without a non-stick coating. We'll see.Customers, be forewarned....Nordic Ware, hopefully you are addressing what appears to be a problem!"
5,Does the job better than the original,We've used this mop many times. The quality of this replacement mop head is better than the original and would purchase additional if needed.
1,noise and vibrations,"Got my v3 yesterday. Has anyone else noticed the really bad noise interference - high pitched and continuous, or the annoying vibration under your thumb from the keyboard as you text etc???Also this phone is extremely simplistic compared to my sony ericcson. Am afraid I will be sending mine back."
4,Motorola V3 RAZR,"This phone is somewhat similar to the V300 I had as far as menu, navigation and such. Just to clear up some confusion.Volume, it's loud although not as loud as some of those speakers you hear in clubs and such...duhhhh...who the hell said it wasn't loud should either A) Get a hearing aid or B) change out the your hearing aid battery if you already have one (or get a new one cuz obviously your deafness has increased in severity).This phone is locked. Someone said Cingular doesn't lock their phones...well either they have started locking or they were talking out of the a$$.Reception of this V3 is wayyy better than V300 (or was it because Cingular has better reception than Tmobile in my area).Anyhow, I like this phone..I only give it 4 stars because there are minor things can be improved (i'm picky). Also, I got this thing for around $100 after rebates so it's not bad..just have to wait months and months for the rebates to come..."
3,RAZR V3: More Hype Than Phone.....,"The V3 has been the mobile phone to own. Its reputation even here seems to precede its true cabilities. Nice screen. Great color. Key pad is stylish but difficult to use when writing text messages and even dialing the right phone number. Better to have phone numbers in directory (many easy ways to access without dialing the wrong number). The photo capabilities are so poor that if you want this feature on your phone, go look elsewhere (Nokia much better). Do not drop this phone. It becomes history faster than any other phone I have owned. This is also obvious since Cingular does not offer insurance on this phone - and only this phone!! If you want to own the phone to have according to the hype out there then buy it. If you want a phone to last more than 6 months, look elsewhere. A true disappointment. Not worth more $99 based on features, camera, keypad and longevity."
1,Junk,"I must say that the Razr is another product in a bad line of phones from Motorola. I thought that given all the hype about this phone, it would be pretty good. I got this phone for $200 and had it for about three weeks and then all of a sudden, there was always a buzzing sound in the earpiece whenever I used it. After I had enough of the buzzing sound and terrible reception, I returned it and got another one. The new one not only had the buzzing sound and bad reception, but also the screen had a bunch of noticable lines across it which was very annoying.Having had enough of this phone, I decided to to get the Sony Ericsson Z500a for only $50. The Z500a is not as fancy as the Razr, yet it's performance and reliability are light years ahead of the Razr."
5,Best Cell Phone Ever,"I love this phone, we have 2. The voice recognition is perfect. The only thing I would add is more memory so that more than about 20 numbers can be voice dialed via Bluetooth. I use the HS85 series Bluetooth in my car and it works perfectly with the phone. I could not be happier and the service from Cingular has been superb."
3,No problem with keeping my same old cell number,I purchased a cellphone on Amazon.com that had a rebate. When I got the phone I called T-Mobile and had my number moved over to the new cellphone. I then sent the rebate information out and received the rebate about 6 weeks later. I encountered no problems with getting the rebate of with transferring the number from Verizon to T-Mobile!
4,Great phone,"After 3 yrs of the Sony Ericsson T68i I had enough. I decided it was time to get a new phone and this is the phone I had been waiting for. It is a flip phone, but it is so thin that it's thinner then 99% of the current phones out there. The software is fast unlike the Sony T68i and since it is a flip phone my hands don't cramp up when using it. It is so light that you don't even feel it's in your pocket. The graphics are amazing, and so is the hifi sound. The phone feels very solid in your hands. Looking at the T68i makes me laugh now, it feels like a kids toy phone. Remember how revolutionary the startac was?? Well, Motorola has done it again, they are back."
4,Love My Phone,"Pros: Loud ring; Bluetooth; Easy to useCons: The battery lifeI waited a long time for this phone-Cingular to go on sale $49. I love it, my 5yr. old daughter loves using it also. Other than the finger prints on the screen and the battery life ...it's an excellent phone."
3,The Famous ''dust under the screen'',"I have had my Motorola V3 Razr for about three months now and dust has gotten inside the screen, so i took off the screen protector and i cleaned out all the dust, but when i put the screen protector back on more dust had gotten behind the screen, i found the problem and it was because dust had been sticking to the glue used to hold the protector in place, i've heard that a new protector is only about 4 bucks so i plan on getting a new one. over all i think that the razr V3 is a good phone and mine only costed me 100$ CAD from rogers, i have always had 4 phones in the past 3 years about all being flip phones so in the future i plan on purchasing the ''motorola slvr(sliver)''"
1,RAZR - Beware,"I have experienced a lot of problems with my RAZR phone. I have had to send it back twice to the Motorola repair center. The phone keeps losing its speakers so you can't hear anything. Also, the address book is lousy. The only redeeming feature is that the camera is pretty good. I am planning to buy different phone even though I still have about 1 1/2 years left on my service and will have to pay full price. The guy in the store told me that they get the most returns on the RAZR than any other phone."
2,Not as good as it looks,"This phone is too thin and too wide when flipped open, it is not comfortable when I hold it in my hand and try to dial a number. Just picture yourself holding a half deck of poker and try to use your thumb to press on the surface of the card. The unbalance weight between the top portion and the bottom portion as you flip the phone open is another design flaw; I always feel awkward when try to press the number keys due to the uneven weight between the VGA and the keypad. The speaker level for incoming call is also very low. Even though I had the volume level set to the highest, it is only loud enough to hear the person's voice in a very quite room. I think that I will have a problem when outside a noise area. My only regret is that I should have walked to a store and look at it in person before buy it online."
3,"Nothing special, not that bad, just OK.","This cell phone is a good phone for folks interested in 1)showing it off, 2) downloading Top 10 tunes as ring tones, 3) taking photos to send to friends, 4) showing it off. My husband I and both bought the phones when changing to Cingular, figuring that they might have some good features we could use. We have had no trouble with them so far. However, if you need substance over style, you can probably do better for the price. We had some nice little LG phones when we were with Verizon which worked very well and were easier to use in the organizational functions than the RAZR. If you need a phone that you can use easily for work, don't purchase the RAZR. If you need a phone to show off, go for it."
2,RAZR V3 REview,"While the form factor is excellent, the quality is very poor. I am on my 4th one since buying the phone and service package in Feb. '05.First, the screen went deadSecond, the keypad went inoperativeThird, it would not power up at allFourth (the current one) the screen has sharp lines across it. Can go away with a hard reset, but it's a nuisance.While the service provider has willingly replaced each one promptly, I would not buy this phone again. The fact that the price has droped form $500 to free in 6 months further supports my positon.I asked the service provider to replace this phone with another model, but they refused. They expressed willingness to replace it like-for-like as often as needed, while it's still under warranty. Amazing.I wonder who absorbs the cost of warranty on this unit. The manufacturer, or the service provider?"
4,No problems,Have had no problems with this scale - I like the pounds/grams function very much. However I misunderstood from the photo that this scale came with a bowl so I was disappointed not to receive that - this is just the scale for sale. Measurements have been consistant.
2,"I'm supposed to own a ""fitness circle""?","Saying this video requires a fitness circle for ""some"" of it is not accurate. The only part that does not absolutely require one is the short beginner routine, which you are told to fast-forward through once you get a good idea of what's going on. I have no idea if this tape is any good because I have no idea where to get a fitness circle or how much it would cost. I am really irritated that I spent [money] on a video that I can only do a very small part of. It might even be ok if you could order the fitness circle through the company that makes the video. I'm finding no evidence of that possibility.Probably as you're reading this review, you're wondering - what the hell is a fitness circle? Don't ask me."
2,A cheapie... that is very loud and not energy efficient.,"With 100 watts and a tiny coverage, this purifier is not energy efficient. The HEPA filter replacement for this product is so overpriced that the difference between the filter and the complete unit is only about $5-$10. Worse, Holmes stated that the HEPA filter must be replaced on 3-6 months of continued use. That's a pretty short life.Quiet? nah. In fact it ties on loudness (on mid setting) with my Hamilton Beach TrueAir 04161, just slightly quieter on high setting ,and actually louder in lowest setting. The sound produced is also a rough motor type sound, which is not so pleasant to hear.Its CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate, a measurement standard for air purifiers -- www.cadr.org) is only a measly 55-70.However, it does its job removing particles from the air quite well on high setting.If you can, get a better air purifier that has a cheap and long lasting HEPA filter."
1,Good thing my company paid for this...,"Well plain and simple folks... those who gave more than 1 star were PAID to give this book a rate it didn't deserve.How bad it is, you would ask. Well let us say reaching page 7 I had to go to Amazon to see what other people say about this book. For a moment I thought I had lost 100% of my programming IQ for drinking too much tea. I cannot continue a page more. That is how bad it is. I think the authors are .net programmers and were just asked to write a book on hibernate.If you really really hate someone, recommend this book. But if you value your hard earned money, stay away from this one. Don't let the Editorial Reviews misguide you. I think the ""editors"" never actually read it.Listen to us; we poor people who actually bought and read Professional Hibernate."
1,don't waste your money for this book...,"this is an easy read book... but with the number of typo and errors in code... you really have to consult the reference manual from time to time...e.g. in chapter4, page 74, it explains hilo generator that relies on the table hibernate_unique_key with column next_hi but the book says it relies on hibernate-unique-key with column next-value... how inaccurate is this?this is just another bad example of wrox book... it's unfinished book as far as i'm concerned..."
3,"Looks good, bad parts","I purchased this item as a gift. It was well recieved, however the clasp on the front did not work properly so now I have been trying to get it replaced and it has been almost 3 months now!"
3,The latch ruins it...,"Just like the one I grew up with, only the latch is terrible. It does keep food cold so long as you can keep the lid closed. Also, the drain is now cheap plastic and held on by friction. Should be screw on with a chain."
1,Coleman 54 Quart Steel-Belted Cooler,"It was very disappointing to receive this cooler and find that it was defective. It had a huge dent in the upper right corner of the lid. This was not a result of the packaging, rather a defect in the product."
3,Average Performance,"Let's face it, if you are interested in buying this cooler it is for the looks of it, not the performance. If you were buying it for performance there are plenty other coolers out there for a cheaper price. There is nothing wrong with it, just don't expect too much. I used it over the 4th of July, it kept the beer cold for the day,which is what I needed it for, the next day ice had melted."
1,D'Javoodoo,"This is an exact reprint of his earlier book, do not waste your time or money. (...). There are many other books more worthwile of your time and money than this one."
1,wrong item,I did not recieve the adapter in the picture i recieved a different one that does not fit mut heat gun properly. I run a business and had accept it due to no time to send it back needed for a job in the automotive market.
3,WRONG ADVERTISEMENT...,"First of all, No Adrian Brody, No Tony Hawk... They use their names to get attention to sell this DVD, I think... You see them in the intro... THAT'S IT!!! Then you see Andrien's interview for like 10 seconds... later you'll see him in Special Features for 5 minutes... so don't expect to see them in the feature!!! Overall, Good DVD!!!It's just like watching regular Documentary DVD about Gumballers... but not many interesting events.. just them driving and driving., cussing... talkie, talkie.. then someone get into an accident.. from there, its sort of good... then That's it!!! They trying to run away from cops... don't expect to see some action.. I mean I've seen many documentaries about Illegal Street Racers.. way better...Watch Jackass' Gumball 3000 or 3000 Miles with Bam... Funny!"
3,Not for a beginner,"When I first saw this video, I had checked it out from my library. I thought it looked like fun and I would give it a try. Dolphina is very beautiful and has a great attitude, but she moved too fast for me. I didn't realize that there is a lot of knee-work involved, and because of her long skirts I couldn't see what her legs were doing. If it wasn't the skirts, it was the camera angles, yes, like everyone else has been saying. I practiced as hard as I could, but couldn't quite do it right. I eventually kind of gave up. Then I bought Veena and Neena. They were a lot more for beginners; very slow. Even too slow, sometimes. But after trying their videos, I went back to Dolphina and found that I could do almost everything. So my advice would be to try something else that is more for a very beginner if you have never tried bellydance before. This is a good video for someone who has already been gone through the very basics."
1,The Goddess Workout,"I am a bellydance instructor. I buy videos to get ideas for choreography and interesting moves. Dolphina's video is shot in beautiful locations, and I like the fact that she changes into different cute outfits for each segment...her full costume at the end of the video is quite lovely. The skill level however, is very beginnerish...many of the moves are incorrectly done & poorly explained. The camera man should also have been clued in that the body needs to be shown, not close-ups of the dancer's face. Dolphina looks good as long as she is moving slowly ( the warm-up segment), but when she executes the faster movements, she looks jerky and spasmodic...my husband (a co-instructor), actually laughed during the opening dance segment. I think Dolphina needs to stick with yoga until she has a LOT more lessons herself!What is really sad is that many women will buy this video and learn the incorrect way to bellydance!This video was a complete waste of money."
3,Just Enough to Start,"Although I enjoyed using this video in getting the basic idea of belly dance, there were times when I really needed to see what the instructor was doing with her feet/legs during an excercise and the camera was only showing her face or the waist-up for basically the entire move. I wished the instructor would have explained some of the excercises in more detail so I could do the activities at an optimal level and be sure I was doing the moves correctly. Overall, the quality of the video was excellent and I did learn a lot. But after doing the video for about two months straight, I'm still not sure if I'm doing some of the moves right!"
1,Try something else,"I am currently taking a beginning belly dancing class and purchased this DVD as a supplement. Unfortunately, this video was not very helpful. If it wasn't for the fact that I have some classroom experience, I would've had no clue what was going on at all. She gave very little instruction about arm positioning during hip moves and often, she would describe a hip movement to perform, yet never actually SHOW it to you! This left me lost and very frustrated. This was supposed to be a beginner's video? I would have been much better off purchasing a book with photos. The best thing I can say about this DVD is that she had very pretty costumes. Don't waste your money."
2,Buyer Beware - You Won't Learn to Bellydance from this Video,"Dolphina is beautiful, the quality of the tape is beautiful, the locations are beautiful -- but this video does not teach you what you need to know to bellydance. IT IS GOOD EXERCISE, but not good technique. For real technical bellydance instruction, please look at Delilah's, Kathryn Ferguson's and Suzanna Del Vecchio's videos."
4,Just Awsome,"I recived this last night and it kept me up playing unitl 1 am. This does everything is says it does. I was able to transfer all my mp3's over. I can watch some of the movies I had on my pc.(some need to be converted, but they say that upfront). I got this to backup my photo's on the go. No problems with either of my two digital cameras. I gave it 4 stars becuse I would like to see better play of video. The manual is not the best but this divice is not hard to learn. The only note I will make is that I had to change the usb settings to hard drive to sync right with my pc."
4,Gmini402 Delivers,"This is possibly the greatest MP3 player/Video Player I have ever used. I did a lot of research before I purchased and played with many a device before I settled on the Archos Gmini 402. The only complaint that I have is that you have to wear the headphones if you want to hear the sound from a video. That is the only reason that I gave this player 4 stars instead of 5 (Mainly because I couldn't give it a 4 1/2). If you are looking for a well rounded MP3 player with video and photo capabilities, this is the one."
1,Doesn t fit,I checked and rechecked to make sure these would fit but there systems are incorrect....stuck with wipers and no use for them...
1,Disappointing,Too technical. I found it boring. Read about 60 pages and dropped it. Maybe if you are an anthropologist you might like it.
5,By far the BEST book available for Breast Cancer Patients,"Your Breast Cancer Treatment Handbook was given to me at a cancer support group this past week. I laughed & I cried reading through this! I wish this had been given to me 6 years ago when I was diagnosed the 1st time with breast cancer at age 33 (lumpectomy, chemo & radition). Here I am again at 39 just having had a mastectomy & reconstruction surgery. This is by far the best source of information I have seen! This book should be available to ALL breast cancer patients. Very easy to read, understand & comprehend. Sincerely, Judith Oak-Watson A very proud ""perky"" breast cancer survivor"
1,Also disappointed,"I agree that this book has very little to offer someone who is interested in diecast collecting and diecast values. The book contains some interesting photos and NASCAR history, but mostly sizzle with very little steak. Save your money."
2,Really bad color cast,"Its a bit too much color. Photos look unnatural and to be honest, ugly. I haven't used mine except for that first trip right after I bought it. Lost many good photos because it didn't look that bad in the camera LCD. But, with some Photoshop, I was able to rescue many of the photos. But, it is an unnatural sunset color - too strong."
4,soo...,"this deck is gorgeous, i absolutely adore it, though my only complaint is that on a few of the cards there was a blue bacwards ""L"" near the title of the card (clearly its not meant to be there), so I had to return it and get a replacement, so beware you may get a defected deck."
1,stupid,"this movie was SOOO stupid! i couldn't even get through all of it because it was that dumb! but i DID watch most of it so you can't say, ""oh, you don't know what its like cos you didn't watch it all."" so what?! i had had enough! it was supposed to be a horror movie but it wasn't terrifying at all. most of the blood and stuff looked really fake and during many parts i asked myself, ""is this horror or comedy??"" but maybe you will like it. i don't know. maybe, 1)i'm not one for vampire films, or maybe 2)this really IS a stupid movie. i would have to say the answer is probably 2. but this is only my opinion. and i think this movie is pretty cheesy."
3,Meh,"Meh. Most of this collection is background music in a light acid-jazz style. Standout tracks are ""You Might Say"" and ""Fast Forward."""
2,Time for an Update,"While this book was helpful a few times, there have been so many new drugs added to market, so much new information about how drugs act in the body, and so much more new information on the importance of nutrition, I think we are in great need of an updated version."
5,This book is not just for kids! Its for everyone.,This is book is was madatory for a college class of mine. The book itself is a book everyone should read no matter what age. This is a great book for easy refernce and I recomend it to all. If you have any qeustions about GOD vs evolution this is the book to start with!
1,Really?,"Don't believe the other reviewer(s) saying that Richards disproved the Theory of Evolution. I mean, come on people. This is how science works. Someone comes up with an idea and everyone tries to disprove it. If no one disproves it then it becomes a theory. This is what happened with evolution. Some creationist didn't just come along and disprove a theory scientifically. Now, maybe he quoted some Bible verses and disproved it but he didn't do it in any credible way. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what is wrong with this book.Even if you are Christian, your children should have the opportunity to learn science the right way and not be indoctrinated.tl;dr THIS BOOK IS GARBAGE"
1,Simply horrendous.,"Potentially one of the most misleading books ever written. This entire book is based on logical fallacies and blatantly false information that is skewed to present an incredibly one sided, holocaust of a book.A great book to demonstrate to children how not to construct an argument."
1,Riddled with falsehoods,"This is the problem with America today. We have ""christians""spreading the idea that ignorance is God's way and good christians should dispell science. Disgusting. Give any other book to your kids, better yet, go learn about what evolution really is, instead of reading what these uneducated authors spew."
1,"Thanks to this book, today I'm a proud atheist.","I think when I was 9 or so, I was given this book. I read the entire thing and was quite the little creationist.Later on when I learned how to think for myself, I realized what garbage it was. Soon afterwards, I gave up religion alltogether.Today I'm getting a degree in Biology. And all thanks to this little tome of lies. Bravo."
4,Nice product,"This is a nice pan, well made of quality materials. Seems like it will hold up well. I dont plan on putting it in the dishwasher. I wish I could've found it in a more fitting size of my toaster oven, but it's the largest one that will fit"
4,just ok,"i thought it would be bigger than it is, but I still use it and it is fine for what I use it for."
2,Crying wolf...,"The idea that our economic model is damaging to the environment is nothing new. Whatever Brown thinks, we cannot turn around the economy completely. Of course we have to take into account environmental damage, and this is being done gradually. Remember when the Club of Rome cried wolf. Our current economic system is not unsustainable, but it does require some smart actions to curtail pollution, excessive logging, etc..Lester Brown and the Worldwatch Institute have made terrible suggestions before, so you have to be careful with what he implies."
2,A WASTE,"AS a rule, I try to say something good about the products I get from AMAZON, However, such is not the case for these Bubbling Humidifiers for Oxygen Machines.This one model IS NOT the one I purchased, Mine was a Cheaper version. this Model may work better than the Green Topped one I Got stuck with. My Main complaint; the Water(Filled to the Filling Mark) tends to Flow UP the pipe & into my O2 Mask! this IS NOT what it should do! The Only thing that is met to happen is the Air goes into the Water & Bubbles out & into the Airway tube & into your nose as Moistened Air, This in turns, stops that DRY Mouth & Sinus problems that we all seem to suffer from when using Oxygen machines.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A Word of warning, check with your Oxygen Machine Dealers for the Correct O2 Bubbling Humidifier that best works with your machine. [...] , Before making your purchase."
3,Flimsy but gets the job done,"It was like having a long, cheap tent pole for a little dome pup-tent.Pros+They screwed together easily.+They weren't expensive+One set was enough for my chimneyCons-FlimsyI would buy them again though. They'll probably wear out in a few years but it is a cheap investment for cleaning my chimney. I used the Rutland Products 16906 6-Inch Poly Chimney Cleaning Brush with it. Screwed on great and did the job."
1,prepare for the awful!,"First of all this is much much worse then any cartoon of the 1980's. This DVD should not be viewed by kids or adults. This DVD should not be viewed by fans of dragonlance or humans.If you are none of the above then you are in for a treat! Step aside first live action D&D; movie, move over D&D2; the 'elemental might' there is a new monument to weaksauce.""Wow."" thats what you will say. Then you will just shake your head in wonderment.Any character emotion is so poorly animated that you will swear that all the characters are having mild strokes throughout! The funny parts make no sense and the softcore erotica does not achieve the desired effect.-5 stars. see it today. Buy it then keep in its original packaging. then rent it and watch it.This movie should be a free download on the wizards of the coast(Hasbro) sight."
2,Why?,How could they even make this movie the way they did? I mean the way they did it was terrible using computer animation and regular animation was just wrong. I really am disappointed in the whole thing because of the way they did the Lord of the Rings Trilogy that was great. I think they should have done the same for these series. I know now Wizards of the Coast must be cheap and turned this wonderful story into a crappy movie that should have been made just like the Lord of the Rings but instead was made very cheaply. Shame on them! They should have not done it at all just stick to the books.
1,Disappointing,This was very disappointing. With all the technology available today why was this so poorly done. If you like He Man style cartoons this is for you. I really thought Margaret Weis would insist on a better version. I do not recommend this to any Dragonlance fan.
1,just don't,the voice actors were all a great choice! The rest just don't put yourself through the pain of watching it just re-read the books :)
1,Worst movie in recent memory,"Hey, watched this with a few long time D&D; fans, worst movie we have seen in quite a while. For 2007 release was more like a 1985 release of early anime.Bad animation, bad voicing, bad direction. Was a real struggle to watch the whole thing. All Keifer S. does is grunt, you can tell the whole budget for the movie was blown on having his voice.Too bad, Wies and Hickman must be crying when they watch this.Buy the D&D; Cartoons instead from the 80s."
1,"Wow, that was bad.","I expect movie adaptations of books to be somewhat lacking compared to the novels, especially in character development and such, but this was worse than hoped. Also add in 1980's D&D grade animation. Horrible, horrible CGI. Corny dialogue. If you must see it, rent it."
3,Unfairly criticised.,"I will be honest and say I bought this knowing the reviews were bad but as an AD&D; fan this was a must buy. While I agree that the animation is shocking and not at all right for feel of the film and it should have been 2 films rather than one I felt it was still a worthwhile purchase. Yes, it was not the film I hoped for after 15 years of waiting but I'm not sure any single film short of a Rings style epic could have done this much better.I would say give this a go as you will enjoy it just don't expect a masterpiece."
1,FAIL,"I'll just keep to the basics. The DragonLance series of stories are great and deserve FAR BETTER than what this circular piece of plastic offers.While the voice talent is good, the animation is half-baked. The mix of CGI and traditional animation makes this look like an early 80s music video. It was painful to watch.Another reviewer here said ""rent before you buy"". I wish I saw that before I bought and subsequently watched this. I would hope that in the future the DragonLance series gets revisited with proper animation or live action."
2,Don't let this put you off the books,"The script is quite close to the books, and the characterisation of a few of the characters is 'close' but the comments other reviewers have made about the 2d/3d ring true. Also, there is an attempt to cover too much of the plot in one movie. Given the average fan-age is older (given the book was written in 1984) I'm not sure what the studio's direction is in producing a movie directed at a 7-10 year old audience. Read the books, and hope that this interest in making this into a film will lead to this being re-done some years later, or expanded in a directors cut at a later stage.Conclusion - if you've read the books, this might disappoint, but at least it increases the visibility of the Dragonlance series."
2,Dreadful,"I am not sure about all of the difficulties that had to be overcome to make this animated project happen but there is an old adage that holds true. If you are not going to do it right, just don't do it at all. I am not sure if the lead animator was somebody's cousin or something but the animation does not even pass today's cartoon network lack luster standards.The voice acting was good, but the dialog was horrible. Where I am not a huge D&D; geek I do enjoy the rich world that this franchise has to potently offer to other mediums. It is a shame to see it keep falling victim to the B movie assault it has had to endure time and time again. One would think that in an industry like Hollywood who is plainly running out of fresh ideas when you see Bionic Woman and Knight Rider remakes. Would put a little more into a Dragonlance animated feature."
4,Great Game,I think this is one of the best super nintendo games they made if not the best. It was one the first the games they made also and maybe the only games that were better than it were the street fighter series.
3,SQUEAK!,"This wiper installed easily and seems to clear rain relatively well, but not as good as other wipers as it tends to smear on the downstroke only. Also it squeaks (chatters) on the downstroke as well. For this reason i probably would not suggest it if these type of things bother you. If you are looking for a cheap wiperblade that works ok, then go ahead and buy it. Just depends on how much you care i guess."
3,Color misleading,"Despite the photograph provided, the color of the poster is not as advertised. It is black and white, not a black and vintage wash color. Other than that the poster is fine."
3,Clarification on book examples and target compiler,"I just want to clarify for anybody considering this book that the book's examples are compatible 'as is' with the Hi-Tech PICC18 compiler. The supplemental website (www.reesemicro.com) contains a ZIP archive of modified book examples that are compatible with both the Microchip MCC18 and Hi-Tech PICC18 compilers. The compiler differences are hidden in an include file, so the modified book examples that are compatible with both compilers are practically identical to the examples in the book. The reviewer below (Mr. Estrade) contacted me, and he had attempted to compile the book's original examples with the MCC18 compiler. (I am the author of this book, and unfortunately to post this I had to assign a number value for the review - so I chose a '3' since it was in the middle of the range)."
5,Practical solution to driving accuracy,"I have six or so modified case calibers I've purchased from various vendors and have had outstanding success with all of them. I expect the 7x57 to deliver the same results. The cases are made to work with the Hornady Lock-N-Load Precision gauge and make determining the overall cartridge length (OAL) for each bullet type a snap. This is important because if you are trying to squeeze the best accuracy out of any rifle the most productive thing you can do is find the seating depth the gun likes for the bullet you are using. Very often this will be longer than any factory load. Please keep in mind the limiting factor in OAL is almost always going to be the available magazine length but any rifle, regardless of action type, can usually be coaxed into better accuracy by changes in overall cartridge length. For me and many others, it's standard reloading procedure."
4,Cute tent,"We bought this for my ten year old son to use camping with his boy scout troop. He has not camped in it yet but we had him set it up by himself. He had no problems, it was very simple. It is small enough for him to handle alone but large enough for two boys and their gear. He can't wait to try it out somewhere other than the family room."
4,Coleman Sundome Tent - 7 feet by 5 feet 2 person tent,It shows great promise for the days to come when I am both canoe and car camping and at my age that is truly something.
4,Good but,"The item is as described and delivery was very good. The Holmes filters are pricey and they get you by making you buy two. Happy that they still sell them cause sometimes when you buy these costly air purifiers, they go out of business or stop that line and all the filters that go with it."
4,Fine product,"The product is what I was looking for. Glad to find it, so I could replace an old filter."
3,Prime shipping took a week,"These work well, I am hoping my unit works better now that all 3 have been replaced because I have Vernal Atopic keratoconjunctivitis, very very severe allergies of my eyes that can lead to blindness.I am very very disappointed though, because the 3 I bought were supposed to be here in 1 day and it took a week. I paid $11.97 for shipping ( $3.99 for each ), though the shipping was refunded to me.....I never got a reason from the seller OR amazon at all during my wait, as to why it was taking so long."
2,Lost me quick,"I couldn't finish this book. I am still trying to figure out the point-one minute Maggie is proud of being overweight and taking a stand by NOT dieting, the next she's doing the exact thing she claims to be against (dieting)? I only got to chapter 5 and couldn't bring myself to read any further. It felt like I was reading a VERY rough first draft and the author hadn't yet decided what she wanted Maggie to be or do. Usually the Red Dress Ink books are at least halfway decent-I'm not sure how this one slipped through the cracks."
2,What a bore,I am a big fan of chick lit. I especially like anything with weight issues.I had great expectations for this book. They all fell apart after reading the second page.The writing was so horribly disjointed that I had a hard time figuring out which character was speaking.The lead character was BORING and sounded like a split personality and frankly the plot was STUPID.What a waste of money.
4,Starts out great but falls off. Still worth seeing.,"This comedy about a gay couple from two traditional Italian families is absolutely hilarious at first.Some witty situations and well-drawn characters will ring true, even if you didn't grow up in New York's Little Italy.Unfortunately, the movie seems to run out of steam about mid-way and a promising beginning fizzles out by the end.It's got its flaws, but still definitely worth seeing."
3,Not bad;not great,"Another cute gay coming out film. It has your laughs, your drama, your heartbreak and the ultimate movie redemption, but it doesn't really offer anything new. It is entertaining and moves at a fairly quick pace - but its another one that seems overrated to me. Why can't they make more gay films about adults who are already out and dealing with really life - funny or otherwise. It seems that once the era of AIDS films came to an end - everybody reverted to the ole coming out theme again."
5,I am getting enthused about writing ads!,"I am just begining my business and I bought Drew's book and tapes to help me write my advertisements. Drew's advise is shaping my company message. I make a hockey puck for ice hockey players to practice with when they are off the ice. My old message would have been about how great the pucks were. My advertising theme now is directed at helping hockey players improve their skills. My ads will include advise on shooting, passing and stickhandling. We will become the source for off ice practice and training information. We were already leaning towards this idea but Drew's information really confirmed the value of doing business this way. Drew's tapes have given me a lot of new ideas and I am looking forward to when I can actually start writing my ads.Pete Dudley, PresidentHigh Score Hockey"
2,Someone Needs to do more Research.,"I picked this book up while stuck in an airport, and was optimistic about its contents. I was turned off however to find vague and short descriptions, and at several times, plain inaccurate information. Maybe someone might consider doing more research and writing a book for each cemetery mentioned in it. When you can find the correct information simply by paying attention to the History Channel, maybe it's time to think about writing your own book, or re-writing one you have been careless with."
5,"This appears to be a good, hardy, safe toy for a little one.","This is a good quality toy. At first, our 7 month old did not seem interested in the toy; but, at 11 months old it has become a great toy for the car or at the doctor's office. We are all glad that I purchased it."
2,Very Disapointed in Laura Childs,"I have enjoyed the tea shop mystery books for several years. However, I was very upset when reading a reference to foie gras on page 137 of the Jasmine Moon Murder. By reference to foie gras, some readers may purchase the product not being aware of the cruel and inhumane suffering involved in the process.I'm not sure why Ms. Childs felt it was necessary to put something so controversial in her book and exclude readers. Even though I have looked forward to the release of her new books, I don't feel comfortable supporting anyone that promotes the consumption of foie gras. I will no longer purchase her books unless she addresses this matter."
4,Rebuttal,"I have found this book to be extremely helpful in my graduate studies in anthropology (M.A., Ph.D. at Michigan State University). I don't know what the reviewer means by calling this book an ""[...] attempt to legitimize anthropology."" Those of us practicing anthropology (not to mention all those that have practiced it in the last 100 years or so), know that anthropology is very ""legitimate"" and essential to the future of the social sciences within the modern academy. No general reference book is perfect, but I highly recommend this as a refresher for general anthropological concepts."
4,A good one for OFDM WLANs overview.,"This book focuses on WLAN system but provides a very good understanding in general wireless networks.If you're in graduted school, you may need more books about digital processing and simulation.However There're many interesting topics you should read. I didn't give 5 star becausethe simulation code in this book is too difficult to use but it's a good one."
1,CARDBOARD CRAP!,"I give this product a one star. Whoever is in charge of Futurama packaging needs to WAKE UP! A cardboard slip means my disc will be scratched to hell in only a couple of years (like with the movies which I love but will NOT rebuy in a cardboard slip.)Don't get me wrong, I've been a fan since the beginning and own all the videos, however THIS will be my last purchase of a Futurama DVD until the packaging producers decide to use another couple pennies to put in a plastic case. I am very, very angry. You are NOT saving the world with a cardboard box. They still have to make that cardboard in a factory and print ink on it.If you want to treat your fanbase badly, then you don't need my money anymore.PS- The fifth season is hillarious as ever. My gripe is with the packaging."
1,Not season 5...yet,"Dear Amazon, This is NOT season five of Futurama Season 5 will be premiering in 2010, but this episode is NOT itWikipedia has better information than you. Get with it amazon. You cannot advertise something as something it is not."
3,works but thats about it,"okay i downloaded it so i could put it in my zune. i know i bought it because it showed up on my card, however, the zune software doesn't recognize the licensing and will not allow me to sync it on my device. i wouldnt think that this would be an issue but the formating software i have on my comp cant change the format either. it will play on windows media so its good for that but if you think your gonna make the episode portable your sadly mistaken."
3,Adequate for beginners...,"A good introduction, but I was disappointed with all the typos in the text and regex examples, as well as Figures being mismatched with the text (in one case a nonexistent Figure was referred to, and a totally irrelevant Figure was in its place). No coverage of modifier spans. But on the whole, adequate for rank beginners."
3,More Explanations Please,I enjoyed the book overall. It could have used more explanations into some of the characters behavior.
4,But did they ever really let go?,This book was well developed by the customer. I love everything about this one. The being the middle and the end. This is a collectors item.
4,Pretty Good,At first i didn't think i would like this book but it actually turned out to be okay. The men in this book were a little stupid! They took advantage of a lot of women and they were also very confused and hurt a lot of people. I guess this is a learning experience book for men and women too.
3,Great help!,"My fiance's grandmother gave me this planner long before we were engaged ""just in case"". I've found it to be great help now that we are actually planning our wedding. The only drawback is that it isn't spiral bound and I've found that the binding has started coming loose after usage. There isn't pockets to keep paperwork in and the only functional writing space is at the end of a chapter with the title ""Notes"". I'm not too crazy about the layout of the planner either. The upside though, is that it does contain a lot of useful information. I would recommend using this planner with another."
1,This doesn't even deserve a STAR!,"...I read a couple of reviews on the site saying how this book was so helpful and although it was big it was worth it. Well, let me tell you - IT IS NOT. It is HUGE. Picture your binder notebook from junior high that had every single subject in it. Except with things that you would NEVER be interested in. Such as pictures of other people's weddings. Why would you need this in an organizer? You are planning your own wedding. If you want to look at pictures that's what bridal magazines are for. I was extremely disappointed with this book and am returning it IMMEDIATELY. Take it from me, save your money ladies!"
3,Easy Wedding Planner,I ordered this Wedding Planning Book the first one that came was all ripped up so I had to send it back and wait for another one. I do not like the way the book is bound together. I feel you should be able to open and close the binder so that you could punch holes in information that you receive and place it into the book. I still have a bunch of papers all over the place which I feel that was what the book was for the keep everything in one location.
2,I thought it was extremely cool...,"...but my son never seemed interested in it. Unfortunately, this has also been the case with the two other Haba holding toys I bought. I repeatedly attempted to introduce the holding toys between 6 and 18 months to no avail. (A notable exception was the HabaTriangle, which he adored as a teether, rattle and manipulation toy.) I suspect that some day I will carry this one in my purse to twirl while waiting in line or for the bus. Like all Haba toys I've bought, the construction quality is very high. Wonderful toy company, wonderful design, just this one was not of interest to my son."
2,Loved it until it cracked,"This was one of my baby's favorite toys until I found the outside ring cracked all the way through yesterday. I love that Haba makes toys that are wood AND colorful for the baby to look at but if it cracks after less than a month, this particular toy wasn't worth it. We have the triangles as well and we've had no problems with them. I considered purchasing again bc my baby loved it but I worry that it will crack while he's chewing on it and pinch him. My experience seems to be uncommon though, I still love Haba, I'd just recommend inspecting the toy each time you give it to your baby."
2,AirBake Ultra by T-fal T492ABA2 Insulated 15.75-Inch Perforated Pizza...,"Does not do the job. I wanted crisp bottom to the pizza. I have a elect stove, is that why it does not work?"
2,Uneven cooking with this pan,"This was going to replace a pizza stone but with the metal pan the center of the pizza does not cook along with the outer edges so the outside is burned while a 3-4"" diameter center section is still soggy. I tossed it out and went back to using the stone."
3,"Good storyline, gratuitous violence & filthy language","I really enjoyed the basic premise of this book, Jaye finds out she and her brother Patrick are adopted, Patrick needs a bone marrow transplant because of leukemia, so she heads off into their past to find his blood relatives. But this book was filled with so much excessive and unnecessary violence and nasty language, I really could not enjoy it that much. If you don't mind reading that kind of stuff, then I would recommend this book to you because it was a pretty good mystery. But there are so many other wonderful mystery books out there that can do the job without filthy language and violence, I would suggest something else."
2,The filthiest book I have ever read,"I thought the storywasvery god, but was apall at your execcsive use of that ""four"" letter word, there was hardly a page where it didn' apear. You toot yourself in the back pages of he book as a college and universiy teacher, well, you must have been a reall bad one because you have no repsect for language or decency. I bet your entire family is shamed of you. I would be!Your bad language added nothing to an otherwise good sotry. I always pass my books on to someone esle, but this went straight to to the trash where it belongs. Bethnay Campbell you have no self esteem or pride. you should be ashamed of yourself."
3,be sure you're a fan,"if you're new to guided by voices you may want to steer clear of this one. even me, a hardcore fan, needed time to warm up to this EP. previous reviews are undeniably correct, some of the tracks are barely audible. however, as is the case with every gbv release, there are gems of genius that make sunfish holy breakfast worth getting (e.g. Contest Featuring Human Beings, Winter Cows, If We Wait)."
5,Younguncle,This is a very funny book with a wonderful plot. It is actually several short stories that together make a bigger plot! This is a great book!
1,Too Thin...,"Compared to the carbon filters that I've purchased in the past, these carbon filters are much too thin. Will definitely not order these again."
4,I remembered it being better.,"I remember reading this book when if first came out and I loved it. Of course that was twelve years ago.For some reason I decided to read it again and didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I thought I was going too. Perhaps it was the length of the novel or the fact that everything is sexual for Barker that threw me off this time around. Maybe I've matured in life.The characters are well developed, the detail is well done, but the story does drag at times. Frankly I was anxious to get to the end so I could start something else.The idea of five independent world waiting to be reconciled is interesting though. I read King's ""The Talisman"" and liked it much better"
5,useful in the bedroom,"The beside commode toilet is light weight, has a handy handle to the toilet bucket and comfortable to seat upon. It is a great buy for a low price."
3,"sturdy, but a bit small for a larger person","It is built sturdy, states holds up to 300 pounds, if someone was wide hipped, they would have trouble using this comfortably due to the side arms, they need to be wider or non existant or level with seat . Wonderfull 5 star for narrow hipped people"
5,POTTY,I ORDER THIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH DISPOSAL BAGS BECAUSE OF AN INJURY AND LACK OF MOBILITY.GOOD DEAL 1/3 THE COST OF MED STORE.
5,Bedside Commode,My 87 year old mother-in-law recently moved in and required a bedside toilet...I am so very pleased!! The price was excellent and the quality was good for the money. I recommend highly! Fast shipping was a bonus plus!!
1,Don't buy this item,The chair shakes when a 100 pound woman sit on it and it is dangerous to use and your skin get clamped under the sides of the tiny seat. stay away from this product
3,Pretty Good,"Along the wave of girl books that got started with the Queen Bee and Wannabes book, but contains some good tips similar to Girl's Guide to Loving Yourself."
1,disappointing,"This a very badly written book about a fascinating woman. The author's sources are not very thorough and he uses a lot of blanket statements. I was shocked by his condescending manner of the cultures with ""the Tartar population in gaudy oriental dress"" (267) and ""the gaudy St. Basil Cathedral.""(103n) He was completely patronizing and elitist in his view of Russian history and in particular the peasant and working class. He seems more interested in the frivolous details (the horror! they couldn't find Alexandra's hairdresser!)and fancy balls then real history."
2,Shadow Princess,"Elizabeth was a truly remarkable Princess, and unfortunately thisbook does not do her justice. Mager has an irritatingly smugwriting style, no feel for his subject, and a way of making sweeping generalizations about which he knows nothing. Forexample, in a footnote he declares Nicholas II and his siblingsto have been stupid, ""because their mother was probably rhesusnegative."" This is nonsense. If Empress Marie was Rh- (notknown) her Rh+ children probably would have died at birth. Throughout the book, I could never see Elizabeth as more than ashadow. One question: why was such a stunningly beautiful womanphotographed so often from the back? Mager never tells us this,or so many other things, and the saintly princess keeps hersecrets."
2,Grand Duchess and Saint ill-served by flimsy biography.,"Hugo Mager's recent book speculates, second guesses, and willfully reinterprets the life of a truly noble woman. His lack of attention to detail (The Sergeievsky Palace is 19th century and was built for the Belosselsky-Belozersky family. It is not, as he claims, 18th century, and built for the Beloseilsky-Belosievsky family) is irritating, and his editor should be shot for allowing the grammatical mistakes with which the book is riddled. A big snooze. For beginners only."
5,Excellent show,"I try to collect all I can on Boy George. It was great to see this show from Australia. I loved his look back then. This video is was great to watch for the footage and more. This was great to see just for the songs. If you have seen ""A Kiss Across The Ocean"" by Culture Club, you will enjoy this dvd too."
3,How To Get Your Muis In Filn & TV,This book is compact and direct. I joined one of the organizations suggested which is an excellent resource for leads. A good additional for anybody who is serious about placing music in film & tv.
1,Bad design,Well my second one just quit. The first unit lasted about six months. I sent it back to waterpik and they gave me a new one. I have owned water piks that have lasted ten years. What went wrong? this is just junk.
2,Another case of stopped-working,"My dental hygienist recommended using a Waterpik with a very dilute bleach solution to clear up some periodontal problems. It did a great job of doing that, and I stopped using it regularly. Recently I started up again, and after a brief period of use the unit basically failed: it works at the lowest two water pressure settings only--moving the slider to a higher setting results in just a trickle. The unit is about 1 1/2 years old, still under warranty so I may see if I can get it serviced, but what a nuisance. The 2-star rating reflects 4 for performance, 0 for longevity."
2,He still has it!,"Just watched it tonight. I was impressed with the quality of the surround sound audio. (You have to ""crank it up,"" it is IS Rock.) These old guys (my age) can still play! I was a little distracted by the hidden bass player who is nowhere acknowledged, though he did a great job. The lead guitar is not quite as sharp as on the original recordings on the signiture syncopation of many Steppenwolf songs, but John Kay sounds as good as ever and it was a thouroughly enjoyable evening."
4,Excellent DVD!,"Just received this DVD and overall, I'm real impressed with the concert. I'm a 'Wolf fan from the 60s, and while this incarnation isn't the original lineup, the band is very tight and they stay true to the original arrangements. The only puzzling thing is that the bass player isn't on-stage anywhere, and I hope that they didn't use pre-recorded tape for the bass parts.Snowblind Friend, Monster, and The Pusher are still my favorite 'Wolf tunes and they do them justice in a big way in this concert."
3,"Great product, if it worked.","I bought this calculator on Amazon.com for my daughter who is in 8th grade. I liked the silver one because it allows for interchangeable face plates. the calculator arrived on time, but it was dead. Did not work. changed batteries. nada. changed backup battery. nada. followed all of the online trouble-shooting ideas, along with those in the manual. Nothing. Finally just went and bought one locally. Works great."
4,Good for almost all school work,"Got this one for high school after already owning the TI-89. I got this one because it can be used on more tests than the TI-89, but I was spoiled by the TI-89. There are times when I go back to the TI-89 because it can do more kinds of problems."
2,"Works, but has issues","The product came in the mail on time and was in good condition. However, the cover plate wasn't clean. The calculator itself works well except a certain character shows up on the screen fairly often and won't clear when I hit delete."
3,good but expensive,"it is good for high school students, but TI's price is too high, because it is officially for school class and SAT test??? how mant pieces they will sell each year. TI should drop the price a lot!"
4,pirate,My kids loved this book. It comes with a CD of pictures that wasn't very good but the book was a hit. Great historical facts on pirates through the ages.
4,Good product,Decent cabinet. It works well for some garage storage. For the price it does the job pretty well. Zz zz
3,STERLITE TALL CABINT FROM AMAZON.,"tHIS IS A GOOD CABINET BUT NOT HIGH QUALITY. IT IS OVER PRICED FOR THE QUALITY. NOT AS GOOD QUALITY AS WORKFORCE OR SUNCAST CABINETS. I HAVE IT IN WORK SHOP SO ITS O.K. FOR THERE. I HAD PROBLEM GETTING DOORS AT TOP FITTING PROPERLY, BUT AFTER LOADING IT, IT FIT BETTER."
5,Super easy to put together,I use this for additional storage space in my small kitchen...it's tall and slim. Just what I needed. I put this thing together by myself in less than 30 minutes.
4,It does what it's supposed to do,"It's a 5 level shelf made awesome because it goes with the rest of the items in same series. It was easy to put together and the shelves can be moved around so they have less or more space, however this one is quite a pain to break back apart for moving (hence 4 stars). I own the entire series and am very glad to have bought them, mostly because they go together like legos and hold alot of stuff. I definitely recommend sterilite over rubbermaid."
5,Good Life Jacket...,"I purchased this life jacket for my 14 year old Newfoundland dog for water therapy exercise. Life jackets are used in water therapy not just for safety but because it takes more effort on the muscles to swim with the life jacket, so your dog builds muscle faster with the life jacket. I like that the life jacket also helps support her head.The life jacket seems to be constructed well, and I like the stomach covering with the straps design (instead of just straps) to prevent chaffing on the skin."
2,Buyer Be Ware,"Purchased this item based on recommended sizing. Needless to say the item didn't fit (too big) and conformed poorly to my dogs form. Should have noted the squared off neck and chest lines. The coloring is abnoxious. Though the price was nice. When I attempted to return the item I was told I could return for credit only. If I returned the item, which was mailed without shipping charges, I was told I would get a credit for the item less what shipping charges would have been. NOT HAPPY. Additionally, the response was abrasive and defensive in nature, telling me this is the best selling dog vest on the market and that thousands are sold annually, etc. Will keep the item and ebay or place on Craigs List. No need for additional hassles in life."
5,Great Seller!!! Fast Shipping!!!,"The shipping of my purchase was very fast!! The products purchased, 2 sega games, are both in good working condition, as it was stated they would be!! Also the pricing was very reasonable!! Thanks much!!:)"
3,Short book,"I bought this book as part of the lighting deals and I guess that it was a good buy for the money, but the book is a bit short. It's more about the stickers than the story."
4,good story easy to read,"The story is short and sweet, with writing that is large and easy for children to read. The included stickers (that go with the scenes on each page) are the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. The stickers feel cheap, as they are difficult to peal off without tearing, however, they do appear to have good ""stick"" as once they are stuck, they are there for good. The pages are heavy, glossy paper and the binding is sturdy, so the book could be suitable for smaller children."
2,Really Disappointed,"I ordered this book from Amazon but when I received it, found that all the stickers had already been removed from the page and stuck all over the book. By the time I discovered this, I had already thrown out my receipt or else I would have returned it. Obviously Amazon sent me a used book that had been returned by another customer. My daughter was very disappointed that the stickers had already been used."
2,What I didn't learn from the book,"Since I have never self-published a book befoe I did not know what to expect. What I wanted was a book that would present information in an easy to read format I did not get this. My first problem was the size of the font, which I attribute to the amount of information. The next problem I had was the wordiness of the manual; personally I like when an author can say more with less words. Next there was quite a bit of information on publishing by yourself without the help of a publishing company, since I am using one of the major self-publishing companies there was a lot of information I did not need.My general impression of the book: to much information. This book is not a quick reference guide which is what I wanted.Having said that there is quite a bit of information in the book so I am sure whatever you are looking for is in there. It is up to you if you would like to purchase the book, I would recommend you not you use this as your only reference."
5,Good Start,I would like to have seen more information on audio book publications and more leads on audio publishers.I purchased several books on this topic. The information is helful but I find out that there is a lot more to learn the more I read. You may want to explore what other useful information you may find online.
3,Ordering Review,"Be careful when ordering this item there is a difference between a SDS Max and SDS Plus...yep, I got the wrong one. The most interesting part of this story is the return when it went into UPS for delivery as the drill shown and showed up at Amazon as a box of hangers. Go figure."
5,The Self-Improvement Handbook,"""Cashing In is a must read for everyone in your organization if you are committed to delivering world class service, with empowered employees who will always do the right thing to make your customers happy and to keep your business growing in a cost effective manner. Recently, we provided our employees with their own copy of Cashing In and this masterful book has become their service and self improvement handbook. John's book will make a positive difference in your company immediately!"""
5,TI-84 Graphing Calculator,"Once you purchase keep it close and put you name in any area so it does not walk off. Best graphs and easy to understand manual. This is my first calculator and it was worth the investment, makes class easier."
4,Decent Enough,"I lost my first calculator ,so was trying to just buy a decently used calculator as a replacement. The calculator worked fine up until like 2 weeks before the SATs ,my screen became completely unresponsive and was black. Just my luck the warranty was out too,luckily I'm a techie guy so I knew how to fix this. But if I had to buy a calculator all over again, I would just have bought a refurbished or new calculator. Less malfunctions"
2,Calculator,I was expecting all connections with instrument. did not receive power cord or usb cable. Instructions on product was also not included
3,Missing a few things but still what I wanted,"Okay so I bought this product and It arrived 2 days ago, Welllll, It had No Batteries and required 4 triple A batteries and the case to it is missing, the screen had some sticky stuff to it but that washed off and the cable for connection to the computer is NOT included. Other than that, pop in some batteries and works like a charm, as for ease of you the people who dont get it are being unreasonable to the seller its not the sellers responsibility to make sure you know how to use something, he/she only did what they were supposed to do and that was to sell you the calculator. If you dont know how to use it, buy a manual or take a class with it and ask the teacher some questions. Instead of complaining about how YOU dont understand it try to quiet down long enough to learn how. The TI-84 plus works like its supposed to no quarrels with that other than the missing items XD"
3,Necessary for High School Geometry and Pre-Al,This is the second Texas Instruments TI-84 Plus Graphing calculator I needed to buy for my high-schooler. The first one broke down after a couple of months and then finally bit the dust less than a year later. Hopefully this one will last longer. If it weren't required for school I would choose another brand and model (this is the same one the teacher and most of the students use).
2,Work well but,"The calculator came in poor condition, without original box and manual. Unlabeled CD for computer connection. The item was dirty definitly not like new."
3,TI-84 Plus Calculator,Calculator is much bigger than expected. It is large compared to other similar calculators. The batteries ran out after only one month of use. The keyboard layout is not logical and it is difficult to find the keys required for non routine calculations.I ordered it because it was required for my son's Algebra class. If I had a choice I would have purchased another brand or model calculator.
4,Decent,"It was exactly what I was expecting, minus the fact that it had quite a few scratches on it.Other than that, it's fine. I only need it for a semester for my college math class, and then I'll probably resell it. It's doing the job."
2,Not what I expected,"I never post bad reviews, but I was a little upset when I received the calculator and the ""Alpha"" button did not work. This was not in the description, and I am now in the process of having it repaired."
5,Excellent product and came with carrying case as well,My daughter needed a calculator for Algebra II and I immediately went on-line to Amazon.com to check out prices (I am unemployed and need to save every penny for bills). We got a steal for a TI-84 Plus Graphing Calculator and it looks and functions brand new.
3,Texas Instruments,"Good service, fastest shipping, but I want in black TI-84 Plus but they send me in transparent TI-84, On transparent TI-84 hard to read font. If anybody want black TI-84, don't order on this seller."
1,Banged up TI-84,"When I purchased this product it was to replace my daughters calculator that had been stolen at school and we were desperate for a new one. While the product arrived when expected the product was not what we expected. This calculator was supposed to be in fairly good condition with some bumps and bruises but the physical condition of the case was terrible. The TI-84 cover was missing so the calculator turns on in my daughters backpack and the batteries die. There were deep gouges in the case of the calsulator with words, initials and names written around the keys. I bought a much better product at the local Goodwill store for 12.99 and feel I was overcharged for this product. Be careful if you purchase anything from this seller, it may not be what you think it is!"
4,More Than Music Vol.1,The Diplomats dropped their new mixtape following the same formula of Diplomatic Immunity II in letting the unknowns get their shine on.JR Writter is very good lyrically and Hell Rell isn't all that bad.Juelz and Cam'ron dont get as much time on this album but Juelz spits some fire like he always does and shows that he is the future of both the Diplomats but the future of hip-hop. The first half of the album is very strong however after the track with Juelz and Fabolous(which i find to be one of the best tracks unlike a lot of other people)the album seems to fall off a bit.The Juelz and Fab song is off the hook and both Fab and Juelz are 2 of the best lyrically in the game right now no joke.No Days off is a good solo song by Juelz and JR's solo effort is a good song to but those are the only 2 songs on the later half off the album that are exceptionally good.The album is really only 3.5 stars but it is still worth picking up and is a good Dipset album.
4,"great music, spotty recording","I love the music on this album. The sound is so warm and inviting, I always want to turn up the volume and immerse myself completely in the music. But unfortunately if I do that I hear the noisy hiss, especially anytime the guitar's playing. I don't mind the background noise (glasses jingling, etc.) from the club, to me that just adds atmosphere. But the noisy hiss on the guitar is a bummer.Anyway, that's just a nitpick. The album is great, I'm very glad to own it. I just listen to it with the volume at moderate level or else with the treble turned down or else with the volume cranked but listening to it from the next room.Still, if one of these days someone found a way to rerelease this album with a cleaned-up sound, I'd be very grateful!"
3,DJ Vlad's monument,"Interviewing locally popular musicians, DJ Vlad completed a unique antology of contemporary (nineties of the fall last -early twenty first century) rap players.Sometimes dirty, sometimes boring but always broadening a knowledge of a topic with a rare footage."
2,New and improved is not always a good thing!,"I've used this Avalon Organics Vitamin C Refreshing Cleansing Gel for probably 10 years, it's the best! I've loved it all these years until this bottle I bought last month. Ugh! Not sure why they changed the formula but I'm not digging it one bit.This new ""sustainable"" formula smells weird, not the normal fresh orange scent and it doesn't really lather anymore, it just kinda is there. I'm not going to say that it doesn't wash my face the same because it does, it's just all the ""improvement"" that I'm not happy with.So, if you've never used it, you will love it- because it's a great face wash but, if you've used it before and are expecting the same old product, you will be disappointed."
4,Great eye cream,Good price for a vitamin c eye cream. Cream is similar to one the doctor sold me and much cheaper .
1,Would give it 0 stars if I could!,"Like the other reviewers have said, this new formula is absolutely horrible! I have very sensitive facial skin and have been using this product for many years as this was the only moisturizer that would help. Now this ""New More Sustainable"" formula is chalky, rough and does anything but moisturize your skin. If you like feeling like you have a layer of mud on your face all day then this is the product for you, otherwise steer clear until Avalon Organics gets the point and re-releases the old formula.I went to Avalon Organics website and filed a complaint about the new formula and am still awaiting a reply. Maybe if they hear it from enough people and their sales decline enough they will go back to the way the product was before."
5,Jessie,This is my favorite moisturizer. It does not feel oily like some moisterizers and it smells great!! It is MUCH cheaper on here than in holistic stores.
1,Yuck!,"This stuff is awful! What a waste of money...it leaves a thick, white layer on your face and even after rubbing it in as much as possible it leaves your face feeling greasy. I broke out almost immediately and had to throw it in the garbage. That money went right down the drain, grrr."
2,"OK, but doesn't last","My first WaterPik was purchased in the 1970s and lasted almost 30 years before the pump finally gave out. It was the family model and came with four plastic jet tips that also lasted 30 years.A friend bought me this model as a replacement, and right away I noticed a couple of things I didn't like: first, there was only one jet tip plus a tongue cleaner (which I have yet to use), and second, there isn't enough room in the base to wind the cord properly. The second point annoys me every time I use the unit, as it won't sit flat when the cord is wound up.I haven't used my new WaterPik very much--no more than 50 times--and the last time I tried to detach the jet tip from the hose, it broke off at the end. Now my Pik is useless, and currently Amazon does not carry replacement tips. So with shipping from an outside vendor, I'll end up having to pay approximately half the price of the entire unit just to get replacement tips."
3,Works well as long as it lasts.,"I was very happy with this product; did the job that was expected. I used it daily, but unfortunately 6mos down the road it gave up.Verdict: Not a long-term reliable product."
3,Just Okay,"I had another dental system that was working well. I purchased this because of the brand name and the compact design. It works okay, but vibrates too much which is annoying."
3,This is not the best!,"I have been using waterpik for about 6 years now, my 3rd waterpik broke this week. When I tried to replace that one I found Conair Interplak Dental Water Jet in a local store, I had to buy it because they did not have a waterpik and I could not live with out one!!. When I tried Conair Interplak Dental Water Jet I was pleasantly surprised by its performance, it was quiet and jet had enough force but it did not hurt my gums at all!!!. A big problem with Conair Interplak Dental Water Jet was that it has a smaller tank, so you have to stop and refill 3-4 times before you complete!!!."
3,Works for me!,"As another reviewer pointed out, potential flooding and definite noise have to be dealt with, but it's not too difficult to learn the tricks needed to keep water going where you want it. My current one, several years old, has finally burst the water feeder coil, and has a lot of miles on it, so I dropped in to get a new one.I'm hooked on my Pik, despite its flaws, because it really finishes up a teeth cleaning job. I have some pockets along my gum line that flossing and my Sonicare (which I love) just don't clean well enough, making for some nasty breath and potential greater problems, but the Water Pik takes no prisoners. Gunk is gone!The Pik also gives the gums a great massage, and when I'm done, I know I've done everything possible to keep my teeth happy and firmly connected to the rest of me."
2,I expected more from waterpik,"I recently purchased this model and was surprised at the poordesign--there were two main things that were wrong:1. The lowest power setting is too weak, while the next highest setting is almost too powerful and uncomfortable. There needs to be more gradations of jet power--I don't have sensitive gums but I couldn't imagine anyone being able to withstand the higher settings.2. The power control is located in a bad spot--on the part you hold while using, and you have to be extra careful not to let your wet thumb slip and accidentally increase the jet power, which could easily hurt your gums.I expected a company that's been making this product for 30 years to have had a better design.I definitely would NOT recommend this product."
1,Would not buy,"This was my third water pick in ten years....I believe wearing out after five years is fair, given the hard water in my area. This was by far the worst water pick I have purchased. It lost the water pressure to the pick after two weeks. I sent an email to their customer service and they said I needed to replace the reservoir valve. They sent me a replacement valve. Replaced it and nothing changed. I emailed them and they sent me some complicated instructions on how to get it to work. Still did not work. I told them that the unit was defective and have not heard back. My guess is that they, like a lot of manufacturers have skimped on quality and went for cheap. The unit is in the trash and I will purchase from a competitor brand....I hope it works as well as my ""old"" Water pick."
4,"Good Machine, but not as heavy duty as last WaterPik unit.","This is about the fifth WaterPik machine I have owned in the last several years. I use this machine with a special nasal tip for allergy/sinus rinses and although it works well, the unit is not as heavy duty as the last WaterPik I owned. The last machine lasted 2-years but I am doubtful this machine will last half that long. One again like so many electromechanical devices in recent years, the quality of manufacture and long term durability continue to decrease as the replacement cost increases."
4,WaterPik 60 a must have,"The waterpik 60 (larger receptacle is a must) works so well you can actually reverse the beginning of cavities and gum disease. Whenever you feel sensitivity of any kind between teeth or especially on gum line, just keep irrigating it daily with a capful of mouthwash or hydrogen peroxide added to the water. Otherwise, once or twice a week focusing on gum line, caps or any other type of dental apparatus works so well the dentist commends me at every visit on my amazing dental hygiene. I purchased the smaller waterpik as a replacement for my long-time larger one but it was simply too small and I had to fill it at least twice to get the amount of irrigation needed to get everything clean."
2,dental jet system,"I had stopped giving reviews, but I had to say something about this Waterpik WP-60W. It works fine, in fact great, getting the smallest food particles from your teeth. But I could not believe the noise it makes.I have to close the bathroom door to keep from disturbing everyone in the rest of the house.When I first used it, I thought the motor had come loose and that the unit was beginning to full apart. I started asking around and found out that all of this model makes this noise, just like some of the other reviews on Amazon says it does.I would have returned it, but I was having dental work done and I really needed a waterpik.My advice, don't buy, the noise will keep you from using it."
4,WaterPik wp-60w review,"The Water Pik is an acceptable product. I had ordered a White unit, however, a Blue item was sent; same product,just different color. I will use the Blue item however, hopefully future orders will pay closer attentio to the color ordered!"
3,Not worth the high price.,"This is a cute, informative movie and my three boys enjoyed it, but beware it is only 30min and it's pretty much ancient. My thought is, I would only purchase this again if the price were to drop, maybe to $9 or $11 at the most. Or just buy one used and hope it was in decent shape. I paid well over $20 and it's definitely NOT worth that much!"
4,Engaging and witty story,"Tao Tandy is about to be evicted from the couch in her friend's flat when she gets hired as a house sitter for a wealthy matriarch and her rare African Congo parrot, Sir Galahad (or Serge as Tao calls him). Her luck appears to be changing, as her career is in the upswing, and she lands a contract with a handsome celebrity chef, who may have some skeletons in his closet. She also finds herself attracted to Chris, who she deems as the slacker gardener (and possible gigolo) who lives downstairs.There are lots of funny ""Lucy & Ethel"" moments interspersed throughout the story. Tao's adventures are pretty comical, as is her oddball mother and the way that the two bridge the relationship gap. You'll find yourself engaged by this odd crew of characters. Harte is a pretty witty writer."
3,"Actually, a Three and a half --funny, though not spectacular","This story is really is funny and entertaining, and the plot moves at a constant and engaging pace. The plot isn't the thickest -- twenty-something Tao Tandy needs a steady job and a place to live. With a friend's help and a little luck, Tao finds potential work with a photo talent agency and temporary place to stay by housesitting for a rich lady in an elite London neighborhood and babysitting the rich lady's African Grey (parrot). The agency work looks promising, and her temporary digs are quite comfy. But, of course, the housesitting isn't as easy as it seems, and the picky, spoiled parrot is cute, but seems to require constant supervision. Adventures ensue. In the end, Tao finds love, steady work, and a place to live, and manages to protect the parrot and the mansion from any permanent harm. I think this is a fun, light summer read!"
1,Terrible Keyboard,"This keyboard is a waste of money. The keys are hard to push and stick frequently. It is not actually white, but a dirty color. The drivers that come with it don't actually modify the functions of the keys on the keyboard, and have functionality options for keys that are not on the keyboard. I would give this product zero stars if I could."
2,No Help,This product was made well but IMO not usefull...with my pain...but made it worse.Would not reccomend. I wasted my money.Good luck..may help you.
3,works esp well for sacroiliac pain,"Found a little troublesome to put on, but works well once on. Neopreen ""exercise"" belts work just as well and are easier to put on."
4,Great Support,"Great support, I love it. Stays in place the skin can breath. The velcro can poke you if you don't get it just right."
2,An Oracle Employee in California,"An employee of Oracle, I was thrilled to see this book. However, the material is superficial, disappointingly low on hard fact and examples. Few takeways. Particularly disappointing is the info onthe provision of globalized products by Oracle - that this book was written by an American Marketing person is obvious."
3,"This is not a ""business advice"" book","This is an interesting, but distorted view of Oracle. Any company that has to deal with Oracle can tell you that Oracle has many more challenges than this book points out. It is not a ""how to run a business"" book as much as ""hey, we successed in spite of our errors"". Although they were successful due a lot of hard work, they made many more mistakes than were indicated in this book. The book is worth reading if your company is using Oracle products. In understanding the hands-on control from Larry Ellison, the dominance that Larry plays in the running of the corporation and how his tempermental style effects their business decisions, Oracle's selling style, and the culture of the company, it will help you make better decisions in how to deal with the company."
3,My mistake,My son had outgrown the book. Opened it on Christmas morning and quickly covered it up as he did not want anyone to see it. He really enjoyed the videos but could not relate to this book. Too simple for him.
2,The Payne's: Edgar and Elsie : American Artists,"Even though this was a first edition, it was way over priced at $90.00 in my opinion. I'm a painter who wanted more Edgar and less Elsie, larger color images and better reproduction quality."
5,Love these dishes!,I love my new dishes. They are casually elegant. I love the square feature. My only problem was that 4 saucers came broken.
4,Must Have For All Salt Water Fly Tyers,"This is a superb book on tying more sophisticated salt water flies. This is not a book for beginners. Only buy it if you have spent some time at the vise/bench. If you have, you will not be disappointed. In addition to reviewing flies and how to tie them, it covers a lot of material on fish feeding habits, habitats and presentation."
2,Received item damaged,Item was purchased as a Christmas present. Once received I didn't look at the item until I went to wrap for Christmas and it was bent on the bottom. Amazon will not return it since it's after the return time window.
3,"Does the job, BUT",The volume of the guy on the other end is recorded at about three times the volume of your own voice at this end. Result: their voice is much louder and clearer than yours.
5,Works Well - Records in Mono,This device works as described. No issues - just plug in and away you go. It does record just in mono which is fine for phone conversations
2,A Rehash of Lines and Names. Not Much Here.,"I completely agree with other reviewers: that all one had to do is watch the Stooges shorts and write down the funny lines and names and voila you have Three Stooges Encyclopedia.I give it two stars just because the section on supporting actors is interesting. Otherwise the rest is just a rehash of lines and names. The bios are even disappointing, it has stuff like, ""We all want to be Curly.""I would advise to look elsewhere if you want a book on THE THREE STOOGES."
5,beautiful,"This was for my daughter and she loves it.I thought it was beautiful,shipped fast and was packed very good. very satisfied."
3,Sicilian Roads OMG!,"Maps do not give you any prospective of the problems you will have driving in Sicily. Get a GPS and ask for lots of advice. Some roads are not worth taking. Some direct routes are so slow and dangerous, that the long way may be the best. Stay on the super highways whenever possible. Ask for best routes from everyone that will talk to you. Buy the map for reference and to record your travels. It also make a good fan on the really hot days."
5,Exactly right!,"This assistance aid was purchased for a 91 year old lady who needs help getting out of chairs. The same problem, of course, exists with the toilet. Even though the toilet is a taller model, assistance is still needed. The arms next to the toilet give that extra ""push"" needed to stand up. This item intalls very easily. The existing toilet seat is removed, this item is positioned over the holes and the seat is re-installed, capturing the bracket that supports the rear of the handle assembly. Then the arms are leveled by a simple adjustment and the job is complete. Best of all, it works great!"
2,CONCISE AND NOTHING ELSE,"This book is more of a historical guide to the modern history of Egypt than a ""history"" itself. The (selected) facts and persona are taken in a chronological succession, being merely described but not analysed in-depth. So that it is only helpful as a resource for checking dates and names, but it is just disappointing as for the actual historical, political and social forces that gave form to present-day Egypt, her position in contemporary world and her most accute problems (among which the ""identity""-problem: Muslim or Western Egypt?)."
2,A bit of a disappointment,"The main reason that we bought this book was to find Irish names based on their meanings. Unfortunately, there are very few meanings of any of the names listed. If you are looking for an extensive list of Irish names but not interested in their meanings, then this is a good book for you. Otherwise I have come across many general name books that have much more complete lists of meanings along with the names."
3,Ending could have been better,"This book started off pretty good.Lots of great sex scenes and Dahlia really had it going.The ending was stupid and didn't fit with the rest of the book.Was the author trying to justify the book by writing a ""novel""? It didn't work and really turned me off.Don't waste your money."
1,Ho .... Hum ......,"I had real, and I mean real problems getting through the book without falling asleep. I will have to admit that speed reading has never served me so well.The subject of this book has already been beaten to death in that we have Carolyn, a hip DJ in the LA area, with a screen name of 'Stormy' (.... Yawn Yawn ... ) lives with Dahlia, can you guess, the much sexually liberated roomate. I mean the names even send connotations of their roles up my spine. So what does Carolyn do, why spy and eavedrop on Dahlia .. of course ...The cover says its a tense dark thriller ... I say give me a break ..."
4,"Nice, but nothing special.","Loved seeing this old concert in full, however, this DVD version has NO special features bonus's or extras. It's just the concert."
4,Best of what AC/DC is all about!,"This is old school AC/DC. Back in Black was just an idea in their bourbon-clouded heads at this point. But for hard core, blue-infused, heart-thumping, good old rock, this is it. There is an old saying about the Grateful Dead that applies equally to AC/DC in this era.....""They aren't the best at what they do. They're the only ones that do what they do."" Guns-n-Roses, Mettalica, Tool and others have tried but have gotten caught up in their own hype (and started singing f'in ballads of all things!!). If you need proof that AC/DC influenced a generation of bands, watch this video after a few shots of Jack. This band fought tooth and nail against the conventions of long-haired rockers that have screwed up their simple formula. Play simple songs. Play them well. Play them LOUD. And remember.....it's a long way to the top if you wanna rock-n-roll!!!"
2,Disappointing,"I'm with another reviewers and I think that the audio just sucks. This is a dvd with great picture, but where is a great and powerful stereo mix? We have the Bonfire box-set with superb audio, they could use it but instead we have this poor mono mix."
3,I enjoyed the VHS version more,This dvd version of the concert was no better than the VHS. Some parts of the concert had blue streaks across the screen.Can anyone tell me if they think certain parts of this concert were redone in the studio?
1,Junk,"I paid $9.99 for this, and it's getting returned. The main light was dim for 2 seconds, then it died. The headlight is very dim as well, with little usable light. The penlight was fairly good, but not enough to make up for the rest of garbage in this set.Some companies should be careful about the products they put their name on."
4,A Nice Surprise,"I was pleasantly surprised with this video. It was pretty obvious that most of the video script was taken directly from the stage play. Although the ""extra"" characters were good, the video is about the three men who make up a family. While I enjoyed all of them, the man in the wheelchair was particularly compelling.There is no nudity, and what sex there is is only talked about (but not in graphic detail). The language is adult, but not offensive. The scenery and the shots of the ocean from Malibu are really pretty transistions between the scenes. I'll probably end up buying it because it has stuck with me."
3,Lily Braun,"Lily Braun is today one of the most know German suffragets. Her Fraunefrage (Woman question) is an monumental work and her another works brought her in her time great popularity. An army general daughter who abandoned her family and bakame a member of a socialist party, a suffragette, pro-choice activist, pacifist, was disowned by family, lived luxury but all her life paid her fathers debts. This book comes with critical analysis of her works and show how their ideas were changing during Brauns life under different social pressure. From and radical feminist, suffragette and later socialist after her exlusion from party to devoted mother and later pro war activist.The author also shows that we cannot take everything Braun wrote as a face value beacause in her works is mixed reality and fiction (Dichtung und Warheit) What is missing, but a few pages at the biginning of the book, is a context in which she was living her life."
2,Cheap Material. Nice Design.,"Scratches on it when it arrived. Would have sent it back, but not worth the price of the product. The Ladle actually has a Nice Design and shape to it, but the plastic material has a blue cast to it that does not match a real glass punch bowl. It will do. When I find a real glass ladle, this plastic thing will be HISTORY!"
3,Sort of a mystery and sort of not...,"I bought this thinking it fell into the noir/mystery/thriller category. To the extent that it does, it does so only for about the first half of the book. The 'mystery' is resolved by then and the remainder of the story takes on a personal rumination theme. To my mind it sort of petered out."
3,Detailed and interesting...,"This book is detailed and interesting; however, even though it spans several historic periods, it can be technical and at times dry. If you are looking for an enjoyable read *and* you like to get into the nitty-gritty of things, then I recommend this book. If you like history, sociology, and economics, you will most likely enjoy this book. However, if you are not interested in an academic approach that occasionally dabbles in the gossip of the past, then I would pass on this text.Chapters discussed are: the Early English Garden (1500-1640), the Rise and Fall of the Formal Garden (1640-1730), the Age of Elitism (1730-1820), from Waterloo to the Trenches (1820-1914), and Riches to Rags to Riches (1915-2000).280 pages, including introduction, illustrations, photographs, maps, references, and index"
4,one word- awesome-,"They are a must to see them live.The first track ""raygun"" I am partial to, but the whole cd rocks. And when you here KTED's voice, especially on the slow songs, you will be amazed. So when you have a chance go see them, you won't be disappointed"
3,very warm but not all that good,The first thing you notice about the book is that it is very warm and radiating energy. ...I would recommend it though if one is truely dedicated to Karuna Reiki because there are some good techniques inside.
4,Steady Training makes for good reading,I really liked reading this book. The author tells a good story of his life training in the martial arts. I found it interesting and good reading on his accounts of his different teachers and exploits as a Miami police officer.
1,breathtakingly mediocre,"similar critiques of rightwing nuts like Paglia have been made before, nothing new here.liberalism writ large, a feminism unbothered by class and race, and many others have noted.dissapointing book, in fact not a book at all, but a few essays of The Nation quality (mediocre) collected here for no particularly good reason.Sheesh, it is embarassing that a Pollitt can count as both a feminist and an intellectual."
5,Excellent!!!!,"This book is a must read for any woman (single or married), who is serious about living a life glorifying to God! Carolyn is very down to earth and refreshing. She is very honest about her life and the way a Christian woman should live. It should be on your bookshelf! You will benefit greatly from this refreshing and honest look at Titus 2."
1,Instead of telling us how it's s'posed to be. . .,"Carolyn, We would have gotten MORE out of a book if you had shared your own struggles, brokenness and suffering and how God's grace transformed them or how you are going day-by-day waiting on the Lord. While I know it was not your intent, this just sounded a little too ""just do this and your life will be perfect."""
1,Who wants to take a course?,"This CD is for a course in building simulations in C++. If that's what you're looking for, this may be what you want. If you were expecting supplemental material or implementations of programs from ""Modeling and Simulation of Aerospace Vehicle Dynamics"" you will very disappointed."
2,Liberal Bias,"Dear Ms. Sheehy,I was disheartened to read your account of the Middletownexperience of 9/11. Having lost a dear friend, I was anticipating a moving story of the victims and thier families.Instead, I read an extreme, biased book filled with your obvious liberal views about the Bush adminstration and thier handling of the 9/ll ""pre-intelligence"". How dare you market your book to the heartstrings of those who mourn those lost on this tragic day. Thanks to you for exploiting your ideas, I saved precious time in deciding to ignore reading the rest of your book."
1,From Trauma To Hope?,"What was meant to be a tribute to those lost on September 11 becomes a fictitious story and those who are citizens merely characters in this tall tale. I fond this book to be quite offensive especially when falsely categorizing the members of my community, Middletown New Jersey. Gail Sheehy may have researched our community but she missed in her portrayal instead stereotyping our High School as that filled with Valley Girls and our community leaders as small minded. In the end she came up with a novel that focus only on the negative aspects of a few rather than the vast majority."
5,"Prayerful, Sciptural and Logical","A book which prayerfully and logically examines both Complementarian and Egalitarian views on scripture, and proposes similarities and alternatives to both interpretations of specific passages. In the process of reading this book, my eyes were opened to some of my own sin, and I believe this will be true for every Christian reader."
4,Great DVD,"I am alway appreciative of any Oldfield video I can see and this DVD is no dissappointment. Again, I only wish more Oldfield video had been available to us fans in the 70's. Nice to see him onstage with so many taleted musicians and vocalist."
3,just a rerelease,"My husband offered to get this dvd for me and I jumped at it. Sadly, I already have it.Anyone who has already purchased the Osmonds Musikladen DVD should save their money and skip this one. It's just a rerelease. If you've never purchased the Musikladen DVD - buy this one - it's cheaper!As much as I love the Osmonds, I'm not thrilled with this DVD or the fact that the customer is duped into buying a rerelease. Will definately look further into the next DVD purchased."
3,Still Groovy,This DVD was pretty good. The only problem was there was no Jimmy Osmond performing even though he was featured on the cover and mentioned on the back cover.The osmonds were performing for a studio audience and they were pretty tame except for one time when some girls ran up on stage. All and all the Osmonds still rock!
2,Very Disappointed,"I was so disappointed in this dvd, It wasn't like a real concert. I went to see them in Jacksonville, Fl,and it was alot better even with all the screaming fans. The sound on this dvd was horrible. It sounded like they were suffering from a cold."
2,An Okay Buy,"As a long Osmond fan, I wanted to buy this video to take me back to my teen years when I couldn't get enough of the group. This did take me back, but I really didn't care so much for the 'concert'. The setup for the performances were lacking in space. I feel the 'stage' also adds to a good performance as performers utilize the space to bring out a good performance. I didn't think the performances were that incredible. For die-hard Osmond fans that want to share their memories with their children, then this videos wouldn't be a good video because it is not their best stage performance."
2,Great Price For these Cheese Spreaders,"I give a lot of feedback on products and I'm not going to sugar coat this one. These cheese spreaders were not what I was expecting. I have only bought from this seller once but I have to say the quality was very poor. I would recommend looking at other cheese spreaders on Amazon. Again, Ive only order from them once but I was Very Disappointed."
1,Ahhhh misandry,This book's underlying message is that if a man expresses his feelings he is inherently trying to manipulate a relationship and is acting abusively. This sort of book reinforces failing in relationships because it intimates that a man's perspective and view on a relationship are simply unimportant. The title gives away its bias and sexism from the get go-
3,A Life in Print,"By a person few-- outside U.S. publishing circles-- will know. The book is best when describing the high politics within major (mostly New York-based) magazines and papers. Sections on the author's youth and family will be of little real interest to most.While Mr. Kosner's ego is certainly large (dropping famous names is rampant), he does have the redeeming feature of not overstating the cosmic value of editors and reporters. They are there to get information out-- packaged in a way the public will buy it."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I had lived with foil-wrapped stained chrome drip pans and trim rings for too long and decided to finally splurge on something that looked nicer and performed well. This set specifies nonstick porcelain, so I thought that I would finally have something that I could wipe off cleanly when I wiped the stove after use. This has NOT been the case. I simply cannot get these things clean. The very first blop of grease that dripped onto the drip pan six months ago is still there after repeated washings with every form of dish soap, scrubbing with steel wool, and today a soak in ammonia water followed by a scrubbing. They're stained, spotty, and much more of an eyesore than the stained or foil-covered chrome would ever be. I can't believe I spent $40 on these things. Save your money, find something else, pass these by."
4,Donovan's complete Pye/Hickory recordings,"All of his 1965 material gathered together on one set for the first time, so for the fan this is a must. Casual collectors would be better served by a one-stop career best of such as the wonderful LOVE IS HOT, TRUTH IS MOLTEN, or the remastered GREATEST HITS."
5,Excellent Scanner,I use it with QuickBooks and PaperSave to scan all of my documents. Working towards a paperless office. This scanner is quick and efficient. Have been using if for 3 months now with no hic ups. Have actually bought my second one now.Xerox DocuMate 152 Color Sheetfed Duplex Scanner with One Touch PDF and VRS Image Enhancement (XDM1525D-WU)
2,Not as good as anticipated,"Sorry to say this product was an immediate disappointment. Problems with scan quality and software right out of the box. The bundled software is the typical junk that no one would consider purchasing as a stand alone application, thus much of the ""bonus"" software needed to be uninstalled immediately. Scanner speed is OK, image quality is OK but for the cost of this unit, I anticipated far greater of everything from a company like Xerox. One bright point was that the support was (over the phone) was far superior to any that I have used in years. Prompt, astute, concise answers."
3,Wonderful Beginner's Deck--Great First-step 4 Study of Tarot,"This is a truly Wonderful Deck for the Beginner. The Pictures are full of colorful Symbolism (I have taken Tarot classes based-upon studying the Symbolism of these ""simple""-looking cards). The images are perfectly acceptable for teaching Children the use of/or stories of The Tarot. In fact, they almost seem to be created with a child-like Happy view of the world, set in fairy-tale history. The Advanced Tarot Reader will not be so impressed with this deck, yet each person must begin somewhere on the Royal Path. Personally, I believe this is a great first stepping-stone on the path of enlightenment. Even thoroughly Indoctrinated Christians will not find too much to worry about in these beautiful cards. This is a great way to start your Mystical Journey!"
3,Not What I Expected,"When I read the summary on the back of the book I thought it was about a woman who was supposed to leave her local law enforcement agency, her hunky replacement, and the summer crime that has her back on the force. There is no big summer crime, but rather a jewel theif hitting small jewelry stores, and Lanie is only back on the force for a total of 48 hours (first for crowd control when Paul heads back to Miami for a couple of weeks and then after she almost catches the jewel thief.) She was mainly working as the police receptionist while the person who usually held that job was out on maternaty leave.While I liked Lanie and Paul's romance, I was pulling for Lucille and Dutch more than I did for Lanie and Paul. Despite this and the misleading back summary, Undressed is still a good book, and a nice foil for all of the action packed thrillers that I normally read."
5,The pefect Guided By Voices album.,"Although ""Alien Lanes"" to me captures their sound best, ""Mag Earwhig!"" is the perfect balance of their lo-fi and hi-fi sound.The songs range from short and fast to long and well composed.In my opinion this is their finest, but it's all subjective, just if you are new, get this one as a first, that way you can travel from ""Bee Thousand"" to sat ""Isolation Drills"" without being shocked.But alone on this albums merits, GBV really shine."
2,Could have been better,"Well, as much as I enjoyed the pictures, and the nice layout of each page, it still wasn't quite what I was looking for. I saw the summary stated ""looks at the innner workings...rigging, navigation instruments,..""etc and I thought it was going to give some detailed definition of each part of a ship. But instead I see a term, let's say 'hatch coaming/shot garland' that has a line pointing to a general direction in the ship, with no further explanation. What is does say on the side is telling about the type of ship you're looking at, no more information about the parts of a ship, and what they are used for. Like when you first open the book, there is a picture of a 'stropped block'. ...So what is a stropped block? What's it used for? Well I dunno. So that was my problem with the book. I did really like the flags and the different meanings of them though."
1,Gender stereotyping resurfaces,"After reading this book I was dismayed at the blatant gender stereotyping displayed. The boys are pictured actively--they drive a car, build with blocks play in the backyard with a teepee. The girls are pictured sleeping, dressed in funny socks, dressed in tutus and dancing around a maypole. Not one review mentioned this abysmal flaw. I have discarded the copies bought for my library."
2,Over Hyped,This book was mediocre at best. It was more about the author's experience (interesting at times) than it was about the Italian-American experience.
1,Out of Date!,I didn't realize that the book was written for the original TIVO. The hacks are all old school. This book was a waste of my money.
5,Series 2 Owners - These hacks WILL work!,"Now just to set the record straight once and for all - these hacks WILL work on Series 2. But, you Series 2 owners will have to do a little extra work to access your device. If you are serious about doing that, you will find it - its out there. Once you do that, most of the hacks work on Series 2.To be very specific, Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 are all useful to Series 2 users (with 1,2,3,14 useful right away, and 6,7,11,12,13,15 useful after you do the little extra work for Series 2. And if you happen to be one of us who have a Series 1 TiVo this book is going to blow your mind!Heck, the chapters on upgrading your hard disk space (which works with either Series 1 or 2 WITHOUT any extra work) is worth the price of the book alone, not to mention the CD ROM which contains the tools you need INCLUDING several Series 2 binaries. You can easily spend $10 on a much lesser CD on the web."
3,NO GOOD W/MAC -- VERY TECHNICAL,"1) I looked all over Amazon info & could find nothing about whether I could use a MAC to do this upgrade and finally in the middle of the book was cautioned against it. So withough easy access to a PC, I'm returning the book.I'm pretty computer savvy, but this upgrade sounds VERY technical. After searching around the web for a little bit it seems as if there are about 4 companies which sell Tivo Upgrade ""kits"" -- harddrives already formated, and ready to plug and play. While they cost about twice the price of the raw materials, I for one am happy to pay for the convenience and assurance. NOTE: I didn't try the upgrade, but I could just see it becoming a major nightmare. If you like to ""get under the hood"" -- are comfortable with Linex etc., have fun. And yes, some of the ""backdoors"" mentioned are interesting... but again, nothing you can't find via google."
1,I Should Have Read the Other Reviews B4 Ordering..,"...but I didn't. I ordered the book along with a Series 2 Tivo. Tivo should arrive later this week, but got the book early. When statements are made in the book saying things like ""These hacks are known to work on the Series 1 but not Series 2...."" and ""Series 2 doesn't support this, for more information, go to this website...."", I realize that I made a mistake in ordering this book.A co-worker has a Series 1 and may see if he wants it, because the book is useless to me other than to provide weblinks to where I can actually get useful information. Waste of $$$."
1,Series 2 Owners Beware!!!!,"This book is great if you have one of the old machines that non one seels any more, but it's worthless forthe owner of a new TiVo. The author obviously knows what he's talking aboiut, but it doesn't matter any more. I sent this back and bought the Von Hagen book, which had the Series @ and tall of the old Series 1 info."
3,confused,"The first thing I see when I open the book is that it is not intended to work on series 2, and that most will not work on this. Needless to say, I was disappointed. Then I read some other reviews, and they say it does. So who do I believe-the author or the reviewers. I will just have to try some and see.If the enclosed cd actually makes it easy to put in a second or bigger drive, the price is a little easier to take."
1,X2GEN BANKRUPT,"BANKRUPTCY FILED November 2007 by Computer World Solution,Inc., trade name X2Gen, per company web site, which also indicates no warranty, repair or replacement obligations will be honored."
1,Did not work as expected,I was impressed by the favorable reviews for this product.I was disappointed by this product after installing and testing it.The water barely drips out when actuated. There is not enough water dripping out to entice even the thirstiest of dogs.
3,Fair quality,Wish this dog faucet was made of brass instead of plastic. It drips if not perfectly positioned. Definitely not worth the $12+ price found in stores. Received quickly.
4,Less mess than water bowls,"Our dogs have always been messy drinkers, even playing in their bowls on occasion. The Lixit faucet waterer is an improvement, though they still spill a fair amount. Be sure you have faucets that are high enough off the ground or you will have to fabricate a higher delivery system. Ours are not, so had to add a new faucet extension attached to a metal stake with a braided stainless hose."
2,didn't hold up a week,"I had used this type of faucet back in the 70s and it worked great. This one I purchased, lasted only about a week before it began leaking like crazy. We have two great danes and a minature schnauzer and having a huge puddle of water in the yard just doesn't work well for us. The idea is fabulous if we can just figure out why they want to leak so badly."
1,Useless,"My dog won't go near this thing and refuses to drink from it. I tried putting peanut butter on it like some people said to do but that doesn't work, he just licks the peanut butter off then stays away from it."
5,Superb!!!,"I own this on vinyl and it is one of my favorite jazz pieces. Although all the artists blow hard, there is a unique haunting rendition of 'round midnight by John Klemmer that blows my mind. This alone is worth the price of this CD!!"
2,Really boring book,"I had to force myself to finish this book, which is really unusual for me. I didn't realize from the product description how religiously-oriented the story was, and aside from that, found the characters kind of flat and the premise of the story to be kind of hokey. Won't read this author again."
5,Loved this table.,This table has a very nice distressed look to it. It was shipped in very well padded boxes. Great table and chairs. Nice heavy wood. Very happy with it.
3,Nice table,"The table was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she liked it. My only disappointment was that I expected chairs as well. The picture showed chairs and I only skimmed the description. If you are looking for a nice table, this is a good option. If you are looking for an affordable dining set, this isn't."
1,Misleading Advertisement,"I returned this table, as the ad showed it came with chairs, but didn't. I admit I hadn't read the entire write up about this item, but when you see a picture showing something other than you're buying, it's a pretty strong persuader."
5,What a great deal for this wonderful collection,Amazon by far had the best price on this collection of I Love Lucy DVD's. The price allowed us to afford this as a Christmas gift for Grandma. She loves it! On top of the great price delivery was free. Grandma says she has watched episodes she has never seen before as well as the movie. It's a great collection.
1,Wait for the Blu Ray,Why waste your money now? I wouldn't be surprised if pretty soon they start releasing the episodes on blu-ray with even more extras. I bought all of the I Love Lucy seasons individually and I feel ripped off considering the price I paid for them and the fact that I'm missing all of the cool extras that are in this release. So I say just wait until something better comes along.
5,I couldn't be happier!!,"I am an avid I Love Lucy fan, I'm just so completely pleased to have every episode in one complete set. The sets are very organized, grouped by seasons. I didn't know until I got this set that there were a few episodes that i've never seen. Any Lucy fan will be completely over joyed with this set. If you know a Lucy fan, to surprise them with this set would caused them to become your number one fan."
3,"""I Love Lucy"" complete episodes","When I played some of the I Love Lucy tapes, they stopped and sometimes skipped. I am an I Love Lucy fan and was disappointed that all of them didn't play."
1,Double-dipping has got to stop!,"Frankly, I'm tired of this. We buy each season box as it comes out, and then the studio releases the entire series in one box with extras not available everywhere else.It's getting so that I'm about to stop buying each season and simply wait for the inevitable box set, but then we end up in the situation that Mary Tyler Moore is in, where the early seasons supposedly aren't selling well enough to release the final seasons on DVD!"
4,We Love Lucy,This is the second I Love Lucy DVD set I have purchased. One for myself and one for my grown daughter. We love it!
5,i love lucy fan,"anyone who can't get enough of this classic show needs to own this series, it's a must."
3,The Year of the Dog,"I bought this book because I thought it would provide a lot of insight about Tai and Chinese customs. It did provide some, but not as much as I had hoped. I thought it would be more metaphysical, when the synopsis said the Year of the Dog would help her realize what her life purpose was. The course of the story did help her realize what she liked to do best, but I thought the book was more of a children's book."
1,Broke Light,Ordered two lights. Both were received broken. There was no noticable damage to the outside of the box when we received them. One had a chip on it and decided we would keep. The other was broken and we can not use. Emailed supplier about replacment but no response.
2,Chick Lit,"Dating was her past, or so Gert thought. Made a widow before she was thirty, Gert knows it may be time to move on, but she does not know how, or who, or if she can. Watching her shallow friends wrestle with the dating game's plots, ploys, and cheats is hardly an encouragement. Then Todd enters her life, and she begins to feel again, but does not know if what she feels is love or just a desire to not be alone. Torn in two, Gert must choose between her past and future, or find an acceptable compromise between.More serious than most chick lit, it also has a bit more depth than most, recognizing the complexities of the grieving process. Her friends' rather petty problems and bents towards revenge mar the smooth surface of the book with discontinuous, ill placed dark humor, however.Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
3,Formulaic romantic suspense,"A one night stand with her fiance's best friend results in a pregnancy, but Mark still offers to marry Kasey and raise their son as his own. When Mark dies suddenly, he leaves Kasey and son Brock in debt. In order to keep Brock in college, Kasey enters into a PR partnership with an old acquaintance. When she witnesses her partner getting brutally murdered by a masked assailant, she is suddenly on everyone's radar - the cops, the killer, and upcoming politician Tanner Hart - who asks her to take over the PR for his campaign.She is now forced to be in close quarters with the man who fathered her son, with a growing attraction smoldering between them. As the killer closes in on Kasey, the police zero in on Tanner as a suspect thanks to an overzealous reporter with a tendency to fabricate headlines. Can she protect the man she loves without compromising her son?"
2,"Review of ""The Name""","How on earth did this book ever get published. I don't know whether it's the translation that's the problem or whether it just needed a much better translator and editor. It's all over the place and while I enjoy a surrealistic or experimental approach I think this needed a good edit or rewrite or a better translator. I found much of the imagery etc in it jarring and it just didn't work, in English anyway. It seemed like a work in progress by a student of creative writing.I think it had a lot of potential - the author has done a lot of research and put an enormous amount of work into it, but quite frankly I got about 1/3 of the way thru it and gave up. I'm glad I didn't buy it but borrowed it from my local library.I recently saw the author on a panel discussion at a Writer's Festival and did expect something better from her writing.Naomi Lyons"
2,Slow and not worth your time,"I think this book is more slow than a turtle. When I read the book description I was very interested and I bouth it, but it turn out that this hole book could have been said in just one chapter. I had the impresion that I was not moving on with the story as I kept reading. There was way to much description and no dialogs at all. To coplicatly written and if the author tried to say something here I did not andurstand what it was."
1,Went back to playing MOOII,"I reviewed this game when it first came out (I was even one of the fools to pre-order the stupid thing), but I wanted to give an update. I recently downloaded DOSbox and started playing MOOII again, and WOW! I forgot how fun this game was. I can still remember playing the first one on my Tandy back in 1994 and both those games just make me cry when I think about MOOIII and what it could have been. Don't waste your money, and do download DOSbox and start playing MOOII again."
1,Spare yourself some wasted time,"This game is hardly worth writing a review for. The only reason I am writing is to tell you to stay away from it.In a word, the game is: boring.The game was delayed over a year (it was a ""top 10 vaporware"") game of 2002. When I got the game I realized why. Half the stuff just doesn't work right in the game.1. The developers promised a book on the game in March, 2003 (the one that came with it was WAYYY out of date). It is now September of 2003 and the developers won't even answer the question about when we will see the manual on the Atari boards.2. The game was patched twice (one data patch, one code patch). They say they will patch it again, but it might be December 2004 before they get around to it (that is their words, not mine).The game is trash and the support is trash. Don't buy it."
1,Wretched,"Dull, dull, dull. The game truly feels like work rather than fun. Stick with Moo2 -- it's much more enjoyable."
1,Awful trombone! Do not buy it!,"We purchased this based on good reviews. It turned out to be a terrible trombone. The sliding doesn't work, and even my son's teacher couldn't play it. It's very sad we cannot return it!"
4,Excellent Book,I enjoy what I have read of this book so far. It seem to a very thought history of Broadway. It has great information that I did not know about many show that I have heard about. I have not read anything that would consider boring so far. I found the book very well written and well reseached by Mr. Brown. I was surprised that it when back all the way to 1826. I was a little disappointed that they was more about shows opening. I consider this book a bargin and well worth what I paid for it. The book was in excellent condition and arrive sooner then I expected to be here.
3,Not what I expected,"I ordered these so that I could practice for a Spanish class I was taking. I thought the Spanish word (with or without a picture) would be on one side of the cards and the English translation would be on the other side, but the Spanish word is on both sides. One side has the word and the other side has the same word in Spanish along with a picture.I got them quickly but they were not what I was expecting."
4,Excelent Overview of VW History,"I recieved this book as a gift from a friend. It digs far back into VW's history from its conception by Ferdinand Porche through today's modern line-up. It is definatly a readable book with plenty of pictures to show the progression of model changes as well as concept cars and many cars from the VW lineup that people are unaware even exist. Well worth picking up if you are a VW nut, or just curious about the history of VW's.""...the perfect chronicle of the VW legacy."""
5,Wow!,This is probably the best CD I've bought this year. It's amazing! Boyzone need more recognition in America.
2,Mp5 sd6,I bought this gun hopeful everything would work out and would be decent. of course i wasnt expecting a lot since it wasnt that high of quality but it shoots 10 feet. It is atrocious. My friend has a little uzzie for 25 dollars from Gander Mountain and it shoots ten times farther. The only thing that was positive was that it came with everything it says and it all worked. Dont waste your money go and get yourself a quality gun. And amazon your shipping rates are way too expensive.
4,Adorable!,"The 411 by Goddess (6 years):I LOVED it because the animals are really colorful. They all have funny voices. I watched it two times since last week and if the power hadn't gone out I would have watched it again. I want to take it to school because my friends will like it.The 411 by Maria:Goddess liked this movie. She watched it right after another review and said she liked this one better because it has animals in it. Awesome CGI effects and you know how I like my animation movies! A wonderful addition to your DVD collection. The characters are funny, colorful and likable."
3,professional but bland picture /travel book,"This is New Zealand has very professional production values but is a bland only mildly interesting travel or picture book for the very unique habitat of New Zealand. Pictures are mostly fairly small and sometimes cropped in a odd manner. A number of pictures could come from anywhere, people jogging, a fruit stand, a motel etc. Even when the scene has interest the angle can be undramatic. The text has standard information but little in the way of colorful anecdotes or interesting bits of history. I prefer the picture books on New Zealand by Brathwaite and Suisted."
2,did I buy the same album as y'all????,"I would seriously preview this album before you buy itinstead of blindly ""trusting"" little brother and just running to the store to purchase. This album cannot even hold a candle to ""the listening"" ""connected"" or kanye's new album (and it cost me $7 more). there is not one memorable song on this album although the lead single :lovin it: is the best one, but honestly evaluate this album people and tell me that the songs don't all sound the same. this is def. my most dissapointing purchase of the year and I'm a huge Little brother fan- or should I say was."
4,"Album Is Dope!! If you like Little Brother, you will love dead prez music also. so check that out to!!,","Like I said this is that real Soul Music right here and if you like this be sure to check out dead prez music as the topics are similar to this album. and if you in cali be sure to catch their first L.A. performance in 4 years as it will be hot!!

4,Don't Wait Until AFTER HOURS To View This Cult Pleasure,"AFTER HOURS is one of those rare comic gems that actually gets funnier as it grows older. While one could argue that 'after hours' New York City is truly the centerpiece to this comedy, give credit where credit is due to Griffin Dunne; he plays an average schmoe with a penchant for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. AFTER HOURS has, for very long, been wrongly labeled a 'caper film'; there is no central storyline other than the exploration of one man's continuous series of misadventures and the unlikely malcontents he meets along the way. Darkly comic and not laugh-out-loud hysterical, it may not be to everyone's liking, but it's definitely worth one viewing if for no other reason than to explore sheer filmed lunacy."
3,"sometimes amusing, more often irritating","scorsese continues to expose the underside of subcultures most of us never see. this time it's the nocturnal bohemian world of 80's soho. the story is simple: uptown square wanders into downtown counterculture and unwittingly gets entangled in one bizzare epidsode after another. the film itself is occasionally funny, a few times even laugh out loud so, but it's more often irritating. comedy was never scorsese's strong suit.rent it."
4,Quirky Dark Comedy,"Can't believe this is from the mind of the Director that brought us GoodFellas. Starts a little slow but if you have a warp sense of humor with traces of stupidity plus enjoy connecting dots well you will love this. Frankly, I can go to a funeral and find something that will make me laugh. I'm a cock-eyed optimist. ENJOY THE INSANITY..."
4,Good collection of some of the best on COPS,"I thought this was pretty good, though I wish there were a few more segments. It features some of the most heart pounding segments of COPS when guns start shooting."
1,Admitted Child Abuser,"November 17, 2005 - A settlement has been reached in connection with a Roman Catholic priest accused of sexual abuse. At least six adults claimed father John Powell abused them in the late 60's and 70's. No criminal charges were filed against Powell but the priest has admitted to the abuse.--ABC NewsTwo of the former Chicago Jesuit priest John Powell's victims spoke out Thursday. Patrice Regnier says Father Powell -- a former Loyola University professor -- started abusing her when she was 12 years old. She just received a settlement.""The idea people found from me speaking the truth that they could come out themselves and speak the truth is a good thing,"" said Patrice Regnier, victim of sexual abuse.Diane Ruhl says she was abused at 17 years old by Father Powell on the Loyola campus when she was a student. She confronted him 30 years later by writing him. He responded and admitted to the abuse in his letters."
2,Wrench,"2 1/2An intriguing enough mix of metal and progressive to flow along ominously and solidly enough, although sooner or later their influences outshine muddled compositions which only really come alive in fleeting moments."
5,"Kill, Kill, Kill!","A well written history of this period that gave me nightmares. Since Lenin and his followers came to power, the Russian people have gone backwards 200 years. I cannot believe the Russian people are so stupid as to put up with this type of destructive government, even though the government says they are.A book worth reading. Why people will idolitize such leaders is beyond me. A sad story of cruelty and downfall of the Russian people.Jimmy"
3,Disjointed,"This book does have a lot of information and does provide some unique insights into the personality of Stalin, but it suffers in several ways:1. The author tends to jump from one time period to another and it is sometimes difficult to tell exactly where in time an event took place.2. It occasionally has some awkward sentence structures. This may be a result of translation.3. The author used the pronoun ""I"" much more than what I have seen in other biographies. In other words he places myself in the action or explains how he got some information.4. At times it reads more like a mystery spy novel than a biography. He would end a paragraph with a question instead of a declarative statement.5. Except for the main characters, the long and un-pronounceable Russia names made it very hard to follow exactly who he was talking about."
4,Excellent biography of an evil individual,"This book demonstrated the extreme evil Stalin put forth upon his country. Unlike recent books describing Ho Chi Minh, Mao, Lenin, and Che Guevara, Stalin seemed to enjoy the misery he gave to others. The first person accounts are quite compelling. This book is highly readable and should be read by all."
2,This is not a very good book,"This book contains some interesting nuggets, and the depth of Stalin's evil is truly difficult to grasp. But this book is a train of thought, totally disorganized, apparently unedited at all. If you dislike Stalin, you'll really, really dislike him after this read. But with so much undigested trivia you'll be lucky to learn much of anything. Read ""People's Tragedy"" by Orlando Figes. It stops before Stalin is fleshed out, but does a much better job of laying the groundwork for how such a limitlessly brutal regime could exist. Lenin was no piker, either."
2,Could have been better,"Although the story was quite enjoyable, the level of realism was reduced by the swiftness with which ideas are run through and the lack of detail given. For example the main protagonist watches lots of videos but we never get any details of what's in the videos, merely overviews or generalities. In this way it was hard to read, because so much simple stuff you wanted to read about is kept at arm's length.The ending is dubious, like the first review said it is an ending of the ""make your own mind up"" type, but it does imply that if something is good what does it matter what the truth is behind it.Only got two stars because of the concept, I did not find this book fulfilling."
2,Review of World Class Selling...Nothing really new,"Not a bad book, but I have read a plethora of books about selling, and I feel that this book doesn't offer anything innovative. Feel , Felt , Found...are tired and worn out approaches to overcoming objections.Ron Wellingham's book, Integrity Selling is far superior to this book or paradigm.Jt"
2,You get what you pay for!!!,"To start this review, I'm not a kid, I'm 14 years old and I didn't want to give my name or e-mail. I hope this advice is helpful to you when you make a decision for a CD player.This device is very poorly made. The spring to open the CD player broke just after I got it. There isn't any skip protection, so it is hard to walk without it stopping and skipping. When I used this, it scratched a CD around the edges and wouldn't play some even slightly scratched CDs.The music will sound nice if the CD player is on a desk, floor, or a surface that doesn't move(and if you have a clean, not scratched CD). If you want quality, spend $35.00 for a CD player with skip protection and a higher quality laser to read the CD(it's worth it)."
4,Corvette Chilton Repair Manual,Good general description of different systems with very good circuit diagrams. Other manuals have better photos and methods but this book is good general reference.
2,No Temprature function,"I had put this item on my wedding registry thinking that it would be a convenient device to use when I am frying food. However, when I used it I found two major things wrong with it. One, the most important, the outer shell got so hot that I had to put a towel around it so that someone would not burn their hand. Two, it didn't have a temprature scale. If I wanted to fry something at low heat, I couldn't, which I didn't think was very convenient. I ended up returning the item and getting something else."
5,Very Useful!,"We are very pleased with this item.We eat a lot of fried foods.Especially fried catfish and chicken.The size is perfect for just us or when we have company.We've had it 4 days and already we've had fried chicken,french fries and cheese sticks.All were cooked to perfection.The time chart said cook chicken for 15 minutes but,ours was done in 9 minutes.It is easy to clean and with the lid it is easy to store."
4,This is a wake-up call to all previous ethical theories!!!,"Have you ever sat in a ethics class all semester long and at the end wondered why it all didnt make any since?? This book is a cleaver look at real life office politics, not just some paper theory on how your life should be ran!! I thought this was a great book to read expecially for the begining business-person"
3,Did I enjoy this book?,Did I enjoy this book? Yes! Was it one of the better books I read NO. It annoyed me for several reasons. Kaitlan escapes her abusive step-father only to fall in love with an abusive man but she doesn't see it. How dumb can you be? Towards the end of the book something happens to Nate the villain that is completely unexplained another annoyance. This was a very easy read that is what I liked about it. It kept my interest except the development of Kaitlan and Matt's relationship it just didn't develop. This was the first Norah Hess book I read so I have nothing else to compare it to. Has the completely turned me off no. I think I will try another book of hers to determine if I will read anymore. This is not a keeper.
3,Do I recommend this book to Norah Hess fans? Nah...,"As a reader of Norah Hess, I have to say this isn't her best work, but not her worst. It dragged on in some parts of the book and was a little melodramatic."
4,Deconstructed Drum and Bass,"I first heard this while watching a video show when I was working in Munich in '99. I loved the sound of it, it was like a drum and bass crew performing on MTV Unplugged. The soft drums, the swelling horns, and the continuous bassline give it an almost jazz-club feel without removing the intensity of d'n'b rhythms. Kym Mazelle's vocals are a powerful complement, and for those who love vocal tracks, this is a sure winner. This is more for the loungers than the dancers, but definitely a worthwhile buy. I give it 4 stars only because I found the remixes not-especially-interesting."
3,"A very interesting book, but does not prove theory.","Overall, the book makes a lot of very interesting points concerning the medical evidence and the JFK autopsy. However, the one piece of the puzzle which Lifton fails to provide his readers that would prove it feasible and believable is how could the body be surgically altered between Dallas and Bethesda NMC since the body was never left unattended or unguarded from the time JFK arrived at Parkland Hospital until after the Bethesda autopsy. If Lifton ever provides irrefutable proof and evidence that the body was not continuosly escorted by members of the Kenndy party, then, the theory will deserve a more serious study by all researchers and critics."
2,Not as great as it sounds,"The book offers basic information on how to invest and save money, but, that's all it does. The book is more appropriate for someone at a later stage of their life, and for someone who has no idea how one should save or invest money. If you already know the basic information about investing, then this book is not for you."
3,Deryni Rising (Chronicles of the Deryni,"This book was OK. I purchased it because another author, Katherine Kerr, in her Daggerspell series had been compared to this authors work. But in my opinion, there is no comparison. Daggerspell captivated me from the beginning, unlike this one. After reading the first book in this series, I do not feel compelled to continue."
4,A wonderful beginning,"Welcome to a world which is simular but different to our mediaeval past. In this world, the catholic is in power, and the Deryni lead a tenuis existance at best. While her ideas grow and devolope as she write, this book is a good beginning. A reviewer has said that this work is not as good as epic fantasy. Let's not forget that Epic Fantasy is a newer consept as such compared to Deryni Rising and other like books. Personally I get bored of rehashed plots like Eddings uses and bad writing as in TWOT after awhile. I digress however, the point is this books. It is not the best book ever wirtten, but the characters, sceens, and readability make it a worthwhile effort."
4,Engaging But Lacks The Breadth And Depth Of The Best,"This is the first work by Katherine Kurtz I've read, and I must say that I found it enjoyable and engaging. Written in 1970 before the advent of ""doorstop"" fantasy, the story is inventive, well-paced, and, at under 300 pages, by today's standards brief. Regardless of the at times well deserved criticism directed at the current trend in fantasy of writing multi-volume, massive epics, this story could have been improved with a further fleshing out. Unlike a earlier reviewer, I found this tale had something happening in every chapter, and would have benefited from a slowing of the pace in order to devote more time to description and characterization. Nonetheless, it's well written and inventive, and I will continue on with the series."
5,A Great Start for a wonderful series.,"This was the first Katherine Kurtz novel I read. I fell so in love with it I went out and bought every book I could find by her. I fell in love with the characters and the way she made them so believable, and so real.Mrs. Kurtz introduces the royal house of Haldane is this novel, and their magical world. King Kelson is 14 and has lost his father and gained the throne. A good novel always contains the battle between good and evil, and this of course is present right along side the struggle for power.This is a very captivating story of magic, freindship, survival, and power. It will hold your attention from beginning to end and you won't want to put it down."
2,Poorly organized. Hard to read.,This book wrote by many authors. It does not have a logical thread which can lead a reader through chapter by chapter. It is also have a lot of redundent information and inconsistant namings. Not recommanded for beginners!
2,Badly organized and very superficial,"This book really seems like a dozen different books wrapped up in one. SOme things are repeated, other topics not covered at all. I am sorry I bought it."
5,The Real Thing,"If you like superb production, superb songwriting and superb musical performances,""The Dark"" will not leave you unsatisfied. Clark's latest effort proves once again that he is one of America's hidden gems on the singer/songwriter scene."
3,way too big,"Okay can not believe the other review thought this was too tight, i felt for the size it was way too big, fit good except for length was way too long, i had to take off 6 inches, it was almost down to my knees and i am 5 foot 7in. Other than that, the sweater is great. very comfortable and lightweight. love it..."
3,My Review,"I guess that my ears have changed over the years but this CD has more ""twang"" than I remember. I really enjoyed him back in the50s but I won't be buying another Duane Eddy CD.G. WolfeTallahassee, Fl."
1,Didn't get what was advertised,"My son received this product as a gift. Only 1 light bulb arrived, instead of the 6-pack. We were told that there were problems with the supplier. Since people don't take the time to send things back, the supplier is benefitting from selling 1 light bulb for the price of 6!"
4,A Delight To Find,"A concert performance by the New Christy Minstrels in 1964 that wasn't released until 1969, this CD is a rare find - it's a little rough around the edges here and there, the sound balancing is not up to par on all the songs, and I think it's one of the first perfomances by Ann White and Karen Gunderson - there are alot of songs which haven't been heard before by NCM fans and the jewel of all is ""Waltzing Matilda,"" a song by Art Podell. If you're a Christys fan, you'll enjoy this CD."
2,weak kneed,"This series obviously suffered horrible rewrite ambushing as the network slashed their future (& their budget) by axing a second series. It shows, the CGI sequences are weedy and the dialogue becomes trite & suitable only for simpletons.....shame....as an idea it had potential."
5,Another great show gone.,"A couple of new shows caught my attention last season. The first was Supernatural. Which has filled my Buffy/Angel void. It ended in a cliffhanger. I am greatly anticipating the coming season.The second show was Surface. I got right into the characters and their various experiences with the creatures. I learned quickly not to miss the first few minutes of any episode, because something dramatic or spectacular would start it off.This show was also left with a cliffhanger. A very popular idea this season. (See Smallville and Battlestar Galactica) The difference here is NBC cancelled the show. With all the repetative garbage on the networks, it's a shame that something truly unique like Surface wasn't given a chance to grow. I can only hope a cable network like Sci Fi has the good sense to pick it up."
1,Why bother...,"I watched the show when it aired and found it interesting but the ending (if you can call it an ending) was pathetic. The networks just left you hanging without providing a real resolution to the story. Having said that, I feel as though I wasted my time watching it because there was no end. It's like you're reading a book and the last few chapters are missing. Even if the book is good, you are still disappointed."
4,Great series except for the ending,"I loved the series, but they build up for this spectacular ending and they never deliver. In other words the ending sucked."
2,Overrated TV,"This is an entertaining series, but to compare it to Spielberg in anyway is ludicrous. The acting is awful. I mean really bad. The production values are pretty good, but the writing is childish as are most of the plots. If you can buy this set cheap, like I did, it's worth watching."
2,Dark pictures,This is a faithful telling of the story but the pictures are predominantly dark pencil and the language is quite old-fashioned. Not for younger children in my opinion.
1,Cher,Very Disappointed. What bubble gum. others must agree with me since it is doing so poorly only a week after being released. Constantine should stick with Broadway.
4,Intricate thriller,"Seldom have I read a book with such intricately developed characters, each contributing to the plot with an intensity that made Black Bird a great thriller. A disturbing thriller, yes, but not to the gorey extent to which other popular authors resort. This would make a good movie and it's fun to imagine casting the players.I am looking forward to more from this young promising author."
3,meh,it is an ok product for the price it has a plastic body which is really cheap and some of the reeds rattle but other then that pretty good over all for a beginner
3,Cops 3-Pack (Bad Girls / Caught in the Act / Shots Fired),"GREAT DVD BUT COULD BE A LOT LONGER ON 50 MIN OF EACH SHOW PLUS 15 MIN EXTRA , SHOULD HAVE ADDED ANOTHER 30 MIN PER DVD FOR VALUE FOR MONEY"
3,mediocre,"well, I loved the footage but for that price it was too short.In response to Alan Russel's review: Europe isn't a country, nor are the states in Europe united so when it doesn't air in Germany it doesn't mean the rest of Europe.It DOES air in the Netherlands for your information."
2,Too short,"I rented this from Netflix. They repeated clips twice. They didn't put a lot of material on the DVD. Unlike the episodes on tv, this DVD felt really short. Wasn't impressed"
5,much appreciated!,Materials arrived on time and in fine condition. The exercises augmented what I was doing already. I was going on vacation and couldn't get to my exercise classes at the fitness center.
3,south bend 6-foot spincast rod and reel combo,"I was happy that it arrived on time and it did disappoint my daughter some,she thought it would be the open faced pink and green one that was in the photo.But it works fine."
2,"Unfortunately, my cat loved it.","I bought this X Mat to prevent my cat from having accidents on the couch. I opened it and put it on the floor. Immediately, my cat investigated. Within minutes, he was laying on the mat as if it were extremely comfortable. I am totally at a loss of what to do now, except to return this mat and try something else. For what it's worth, I think that heavier animals would be more deterred more than my relatively lightweight cat; the nubs are really quite painful! I rated this 2 stars, because it was not useful for me.NOTE: The shipper was great and the items arrived as expected -- 5 stars for them."
5,Finally- Something that works as advertised!,This product has saved my new sofa. This works well to keep my dogs off of my furniture. They are easy to use and store when not needed. I highly recomend these and would buy them again.
3,Only good for perfectly flat surfaces,"I bought these because we have a small dog that likes to jump on the ends of the couch and love-seat. I have scat-mats which work great for our two cats, but this is dog that was rescued from a breading mill so I did not want to traumatize it further. One of the pictures showed them on couch arms. Looking back they must have been very wide. They work if placed on a flat surface though. I think some of the people who had trouble may have had animals with extra fur on their paws. That is actually why we bought the scat-mats. Our two cats are Ragdolls and have heavily padded feet.In short, only buy if pets have sensitive paws and use for flat surfaces only."
3,Quality hand folded brochures,"I am able to produce a quality hand folded brochure with the 48 pound glossy, pre-scored brochure paper. I have a problem with this paper in that it doesn't work with my Martin Yale automatic folder. In the future I will will be looking for a lighter, un-scored glossy paper that should be cheaper, work with my automatic folder, and still produce a quality brochure."
2,Not what I expected.,This product is inferior to the original HP brochure paper. Is is NOT bright white and it squeeks when folded. It works...but...I will look for another brand once this is gone.
1,Worst travel or art video ever!,"This is easily the worst travel video of all time.One telling example is the Venus de Milo segment. This begins with a full screen title ""Aphrodite...Venus de Milo"" while the narrator reads ""One of the most famous treasures is the perfectly formed statue of Aphrodite, better known as Venus de Milo."" However, the video images throughout this segment are of Winged Victory. We never see Venus de Milo.The editing is poor. As the narrator describes a David painting, the video moves to a Watteau painting. The camera work is shaky and frequently crops the tops of art works.There are numerous other errors:> The number of exhibits in the Louvre is wildly exaggerated> The names of French kings are laughable> The history of how the Mona Lisa came to the Louvre is simple wrongThe length is only 10 minutes, thankfully.So poor is this DVD that I will be returning it to Amazon immediately."
2,Not very good,"I wouldn't have reviewed this one at all, but I see the other two reviews were both 5-star ratings, and had to add that not everyone loves this book. It's an impressive accomplishment, but have a look at the publisher's web site and you'll probably know what you need to in order to decide if this one's for you. It reads like a very competent try by a writer who, if he keeps at it, will be good someday. Not today, though. Sorry."
5,Teaching an old dog......,"Humorus and enlightening at the same time. Surely the design of a petroleum refinery would have to left to someone else. But, I know a great deal more about the process. Thanks, Mr. Leffler."
5,Absolutely Wicked!,I was there when they literally set the Ballard Firehouse on fire! This band is sure to be a hit before too long.
1,"overpriced, cheaply made and a nightmare to assemble","They should list this a a kit to build the thing, as NOTHING is preassembled -- and it's a cheap kit at that. Even the bearings that this thing rides on are plastic. The whole thing comes shipped as 40+ pieces of low-quality particle board, some of which were already chipped when it got here. If it didn't weight 100 lbs, sending it back would be a no-brainer. As it is, I've got some thinking to do. Very much regret the purchase."
3,"Fun, but...","I bought this CD for my 6-month-old. I am bilingual and speak only Spanish to him. I wanted music that was familiar to me and fun, too. I bought this CD and the music is certainly familiar, but, my husband describes it as ""creepy."" The ""children"" singing aren't really kids. It sounds like adults with voices digitally altered to sound like kids. So, the music is fun and definitely many songs from my childhood but my husband just gets this look of fear on his face when I play it. ;)"
2,Not the best book available,"A little outdated, quite a few beers here aren't made anymore. Beer reviews are always personal opinion, and you'll read a bunch of people complain in these reviews that this guy doesn't know what hes talking about. I'd ignore what they say, everybody has their own preference.Think about this before you buy this book:1) Why do you need to hear what somebody else things of beers?2) its very out dated... 5 years is a long time."
1,hopeless,"Funny how all those glowing five-star reviews are anonymous... Robert Klein is an expert only in his own eyes. Ask a brewer, any brewer, who the real experts in the field are before you waste money on this book.And, whatever you do, don't buy it for me for Christmas."
1,Totally of the mark,It looks to me that Mr. Klein has no idea what the word beer means. Never have i found so much misinformation about beer in one book. I bought this book just so as to make sure no unsuspecting soul would buy it believing its vastly exagerated claims. Apart from singing his own praises nothing else in this book makes sense. An absolute disaster. Avoid it at all cost.
1,beer misinformation,"I would like to precede my comments with the fact that I am a certified beer judge through the national beer judge certification program. I have studied beer styles and brewing for the last 3.5 years. Mr. Klein's reviews range from slightly misinformed to down right ludicrous. His companion calendar, which is pretty much lifted from this book, is now a daily laugh to pick up my spirits as I read his comically misinformed reviews. I believe the review by Mr. Moore is right on the money. If you are interested in a excellent representation of beer styles and commercial examples, I suggest any of Michael Jackson's books (no, not the singer)"
1,When they start banning books in this country...,"I hope they begin with this one. This book's one redeeming attribute is that it fits well under my wobbly table's leg. Once that table is fixed, this trashy book is history."
1,It Must Be A Cruel Joke!!!,"Bob Klein truly misses the mark on almost every beer he reviews. His credentials are sketchy, if not non-existent, and he displays an almost epic cluelessness about beer.Having spent a number of years educating people about beer, hosting beer lectures, judging beer, brewing beer, and travelling extensively to study beer, I am deeply disturbed that anyone might actually use this collection of drivel as a guide for beer.Save your money, spend it on good beer, and a copy of anything by Michael Jackson. Klein's book is a travesty against beer knowledge and is in a league of itself (though Papazian's books come pretty darn close)."
5,Outstanding Review of Beer,"I would like to preface my remarks by stating that I speak from the haze of many years of unbridled consumption. This guide has revealed new worlds to me, expanded my mind, and touched my very soul."
5,Klein is The Expert,This is the best guide to beer around. Klein really knows beer and writes intellegently about it.A very good book!
2,just ok,"I had seen other reviews for this book, raving about it. To me, it indicates that there is a dearth in the art curriculum arena. I need to quit my day job and start writing. The book is colorful and has some merit, but is really nothing more than someone's collection of pictures for children to copy. Somewhere, somehow, I would love to find an art curriculum for children that is deeper than a creek bed but also practical."
3,Can't Find Process to Upgrade to XP Pro,"I have the standard edition, and Access is not included. I need Access. How do I upgrade from Standard to Pro to get Access, or, better yet, how can I get Access and install it? The package lacks consistency, since it doesn't tell me how I can economically do this."
2,Good product and read here about activation woes (gone?),"Well, I finally decided to format my folks pc and reinstall all my software. Also decided to buy Office XP since I am a student and I qualify and I liked the price. Found out by reading these reviews that you can only install it once and have to beg and plead if your machine crashes and you need to reinstall.I resent being treated like a criminal when I have legitimately bought the software. It is enough to make someone (not me of course =o) ) download an activation crack so that they don't have to beg MS to allow them to install software they have paid for. Interesting no?"
3,ok did not see any amplification,"I had another RCA (with no powered amplification) and that one was as good as this one. I was hoping that the amplifier would give better quality and might receive more channels, but no. So, this one as good as any other cheaper RCA model (atleast my ANT120B) and not worth extra price."
4,It grows on you,"Not something I would expect myself to say about a band as kitschy and hit-you-over-the-head as Pizzicato 5. The remixes on here are widely varied in approach, some of which are immediately likeable but some of which take getting used to. The highlight of the album is from Oval, with a chugging, churning mix of ""Happy Ending"" which is essential. Nothing else on here really lives up to these expectations, although several come close, such as the chunky beats and boinging trance of the Daniel Miller/Gareth Jones remix of ""The World is Spinning at 45 rpm"" and the 808 state mix of ""Trailer music."" I loved ""Happy End of the World"" so this one isn't quite as great, but there are moments that make this one worth looking into if you are a fan."
2,California Institute of Technology Graduate Student,"I do not recommend this book for the following reasons.1) It could be summarized in 5 pages2) Some of the assumptions used in the model are not valid3) I tested the model and it does not work4) few equations makes it difficult to follow at some points.There are some major shortcomings in this book. Major ones include assuming that the change in the log of the price of a stock is a gaussian random variable and that day to day prices are not correlated. I tested this and it was not true in any of the cases I tried. The world is not gaussian and events are often correlated.For purely academic reading, this book may be interesting, but I suggest that anyone doing so supplement their reading with some real-life statistics of their own."
3,A personal journey with some helpful information.,"Bought this for older person (85) who had carpel tunnel operation on their wrists.It is a managable size; the pages turn and stay open easily with the ring binding.Feedback from the receiver suggests their are some interesting ideas in there andsome of the entries are hard to follow by words alone. Would benefit from illustrations or better still a demonstration video. A lot seemed to be stating the obvious but that's good for someone coming to terms with their situation. There doesn't seem to be a host of products out there in this area.In summary, I would get it as a beginners overview and practical account of how one person has learnt to deal with their situation and keep looking for more visual products."
2,Not very universal,"RCA RCU 300 would not control two of my VCRs:Panasonic Omnivision VHSSharp VC-H942However, it did control my Toshiba TV and my Sony VCR. I am dissatisfied b/c I really needed this universal remote to control my Panasonic VCR."
1,DAZZLING DUNKS AND BASKETBALL BLOOPERS,"I was pumped when I purchased this DVD. But then it was met with sadness. This is ""THE ALL NEW"" Dazzling Dunks and Basketball Bloopers, not the great original classic. This DVD is poor at best. And the packaging does not tell you that it is not the original, nor does the disc itself! VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!"
1,Disappointed like many others,I too thought I'd be receiving a dvd version of Dazzling Dunks & Basketball Bloopers . . . and not the updated version. Quite deflating.
3,Logitech ClickSmart 510,"NEGATIVE:- too big.- the stand is hard to adjust and mine broke, so i cant adjust it at all. the camera is so heavy that it just leans down because the stand cant even keep it up anymore.- when it's not connected to the computer, the flash sucks. it's too bright when you take a picture. everything is white.- the settings and coloring aren't that good.POSITIVE:+ clear pictures+ portable... etc."
2,disappointed,"I had heard a few tracks from Neuroactive, and decided to buy the CD. I found 2 tracks that were worth buying, but the rest of the CD was a disappointment."
1,Windows 7,"Great game until you buy a new computer with Win7. I called to tech support was informed they BIA2 won't work on Windows 7. Q: Do you have a work around? A: No Q: Will there be a patch release to take care of this? A: No Q: So I wasted $50.00 on game that won't be upgraded? A: Yes, sorry.Totally unacceptable customer service."
1,Worst Game Ever????,"I have been playing FPS games since the early days of Wolf3D and Doom for DOS. This is absolutely the worst shooter I have ever had the misfortune to buy. The built in ""strategy"" scripting will give you a migraine. Unless you are right where the script wants you to be, you could empty 100 point blank rounds into your opponents head and they will then shout at you and kill you with one shot... while your moronic ""AI"" troops cry ""I'm taking fire!""Totally absurd and constipated game design. Can you believe there is not even a Run or Sprint key for movement? So you must creep at a snails pace through the ""authentic"" battlefields scripted for suicide. Buy Call of Duty (1 or 2)."
1,DO NOT BUY THE SOLUTION MANUAL! It's a TRICK!!,"I am taking a course using ""Active Stats"" ISBN 0-321-28671-5 as the textbook. The textbook includes an appendix with solutions for the odd numbered homework problems only, but I wanted all of the solutions to help doublecheck my work as I went. This manual is advertised (by name and ISBN number) on the back ""Active Stats"" as the companion ""Student Solutions Manual"", so I ordered it. When I received it I was shocked to discover that all this Manual contains are the odd numbered solutions - which, as I mentioned above, are already in the textbook as Appendix B!!!I am writing a letter of complaint to Addison Wesley. The company should be ashamed for publishing the SAME EXACT material that appears as Appendix B Pps A-4 through A-43 in the textbook as a supplementary text- and for advertising it as such on the back of the textbook! Shame on Addison Wesley!!!"
2,Good quality but poor fit,"I have a late model Kenmore range, which according to the manufacturer these should fit. The two small 6"" drip pans fit fine, but the two larger 8"" drip pans don't sit all the way in my stove's openings, leaving them protruding about an 1/8"" and requiring some creative positioning of the burner. I don't know why it is so difficult to find properly sized replacement drip pans. The pans are heavier and of a higher quality than what originally came with my stove, however."
4,a nice live video that showcases the early years of UB40,"This video is definitely one for UB40 fans. It's great for the older fans who remember listening to these songs when they were first released...it's also a great item for young fans, to see what the band were like before they really cracked it to the top.It'll keep you grooving all the way through, that's for sure!"
3,This episode of MST3K starts off great then it falls...,"We have another classic MST3K episode on our hands here people. This MST3K is episode #320. This one starts off so well, then it dies. The first segments are great. Then we get into the theater and we watch two shorts. The riffs on the shorts are just hilarious. After the shorts we leave the theater and we get a great segment based on one of the shorts. After that we enter the theater to watch the movie and then that's where the video starts to stink. This movie is just so bad that Joel & the bots can't even help it out. Even though the movie ruins this episode it's still worth getting this episode. The riff during the shorts seem to make up for the movie. I still give this episode 3 starts. One for the segments, and two for the shorts. Enjoy..."
1,Not as I excepted,"Low QLTY plastics,the parts are not holding to each other in a good wayam not happy with it at all,but for a collecter it's great to be but on the shelf"
4,Great guide for Denver and front range Mountain Bike rides,"Though my husband is an avid Mtn. Biker, I am fairly new at the sport and less experienced. We have been using this book as I gain skills taking me from beginner to advanced trails. The book is nice and small and should fit in your camel back. I would recommend this to anyone living in the area, or planning to vacation in Beautiful Colorado!"
4,"Good Service, Great price.","The price for the item was great. The Cd was in very good condition; the case looked almost new, the Cd had almost no scratches, which is rare with used Cd's. It plays just fine. Since it was a live Cd The song I was looking for was a live version which did not have all of the words, as sometimes is true of live performances, but this of course had nothing to do with the seller. I had hoped it would be like the studio performance and took a chance because it was a great price. I will enjoy it anyway. Thanks for a good experience."
2,"How many ""greatest hits"" CDs can Columbia fleece the public","Just looking over these song titles, there's nothing here that's not on a 1000 other compilations!! Columbia has done a fine job of remastering Miles' original albums, but these compilations are ludicrous. It's like taking bits and pieces of Shakespeare (a litte bit of ""Hamlet,"" ""Macbeth,"" etc.) and repackaging them as a book of quotes - it's just not the same! Miles' music demands to be listened to as an album experience (start with ""Kind of Blue"" and you'll see why it's still a best-seller 43 years later!), not as a bunch of unconnected pieces. Stop the madness Columbia, we're onto you!!!!"
1,Music: 5 stars of course,"But flooding the marker with yet another greatest hits compilation after a good 2CD compilation was released a couple of years ago: 1 star for Columbia execs. The music is all good, good track choices, no argument there. Something I dont like: this compilation never mentions that this is the best of Miles while recording for Columbia. So basically this is for someone who wants some Miles in the collection but thinks that the 2 CD is too much. Let me give you an advice: buy Kind of Blue as your first Miles album. Listen and enjoy ALL tracks, not just 'So What'. Then compare all that you have in Kind of Blue that you would have missed by just getting this compilation. Well, its the same for 'In a Silent Way', 'Porgy and Bess', 'Milestones', etc."
2,ENOUGH IS ENOUGH COLUMBIA! WE HAVE ALL OF THIS ALREADY!,"I am not the first one to write that complaint. Read the other reviews here. I am just one of the many. I, too, am sick of all of the Columbia constant day-after-day repacking of Miles' music. This is a cash cow, no doubt.I'd say that Blue Note, Warner Bros. and Prestige all have a right to release compilations for Miles, because there haven't gone on overload with compilations. But Columbia has.Overall, don't buy this. You already have this! You've bought it, say, a million times before! JUST IGNORE THIS! Go buy 'Ken Burns Jazz,' 'The Best of Miles Davis (Blue Note),' and 'The Best of Miles Davis (Prestige).'Don't buy this. 2 stars for Miles Davis, 1 star for Columbia/Sony's greed.NOT RECOMMENDED."
5,Great Music - But Only The Tip of The Iceberg,"All the tracks on this disc are great, but with Miles you really need several discs to get the whole story. For starters - Birth of the Cool (on Capitol), Kind of Blue, In A Silent Way, and Bitches Brew -- 3 of these albums are represented by 3 outstanding tracks here, but you should really hear the original albums and contexts to appreciate their power. Miles was a true musical genius -- one whose career went through at least 3 major periods, as well as offshoots. It's impossible to sum him up in 1 album - particularly as the style changes might be a little abrupt as you listen. But if you're on a budget and looking for a 1 disc sampler, this will do the job."
4,Wow!!!,"I'm no jazz expert but I know what I like. This is a showcase for Miles Davis' trumpet. Includes such classics as 'I Loves You Porgy', 'Time After Time' and 9 others. Over 70 minutes of incredible jazz."
5,One theory behind European ascendancy.,"Outstanding thesis: The West isn't fundamentally different from any other civilization in history -- not braver, not better. Like everyone else, we kicked but to get what we wanted. We just did it better than everyone else, at least we have over the recent millennium. He poses an explanation of why we were able to do that. He attributes it to a combination of nine characteristics of Western culture that usually were not found together in other cultures, and certainly not as consistently as in the West: freedom, civic militarism, decisive battle (as opposed to ritualistic battle), technology, capitalism, discipline, civil control over military operations, free speech and dissent, and constitutional government.A most interesting read (albeit a bent towards Eurocentrism probably makes it easier to accept)."
1,A book for the Ages,"I particularly enjoyed ancient Greek warfare. This is of course Hanson's specialty. But I do think this should be required reading for any student of warfare or politics,"
2,Ideological theory of history -- and extremely repetitious,"Because of the infinite complexity of human behavior, attempts to explain it are almost wholly speculative - especially when the subject is as complex as war. With no nod to that reality, Mr. Hanson unimaginatively adopts the popular myths of the ideological right to explain what he believes has been an unbroken history of Western military dominance. Some of the reasons that he offers are capitalism, freedom, and individualism. He should be writing political speeches, not history. His theories are just plain silly.If you can skim through the countless repetitive passages, much of his descriptive material is, however, interesting."
4,Eye-Opening Viewpoint on Great Battles,A really informative book based on the thesis that free Western peoples fight better than those from countries that subject their citizens to warfare that means little to the individual. Precise and vivid descriptions of conflicts from early Greek city-states time all the way to the present. I learned so much from it.
4,Carnage and Culture,Excellent book. Details how democracy has evolved and makes it clear that is the most natural moral and successful political culture.
5,Loved it...A must see!,I enjoyed this movie more than the Disney version. My girls and I love the music score. How can I obtain the music. I've looked everywhere and cannot find the music. Please write back and let me know.
5,sad :(,I absolutely adore this movie. But it saddens me that still noone has put it onto dvd. I figured for sure by now it would be on dvd. maybe someday!
1,I'ts soo bad...but will make you laugh!,"First of all, my sister got this video for free so we didn't waste any money on it. The songs are written with some poor lyrics a 3 year old could make better songs. The costumes are cheap...I think they got them for 1/2 price after Halloween at Kmart. The cast are a bunch of people you have seen before in films but you can't remember their names because they suck anyways. If you are drunk or want a good laugh, watch this movie. It's like eating at a bad buffet you eat till you get full and you puke afterwards!!!"
3,The worst actress ever,"Although the made for television movie is rather faithful to the book, the lead, Natalie Gregory, is a horrible actress."
5,Great childhood movie,"This is the Alice In Wonderland I grew up watching. It's a made for TV movie that my grandmother taped for me. I literally watched it everday for years. As a matter of fact, it's the only Alice In Wonderland I've ever seen. I had searched for it before, but never had any luck. I was ecstatic when I finally found it on here! I watched it the day it was delivered. It's still just as enjoyable as it was when I was 5."
3,a little disappointed,"Like most of the other reviewers, I'd been searching for a copy of this movie for years. It was years ago when I last saw it, and I was ecstatic to find it here on Amazon. However, I was disappointed when I saw that some scenes had been cut from the version I watched repeatedly as a child. The beginning scene where Alice bothers her sister outside by the pond while she's reading. And another cut scene where Alice babysits someone's baby in Looking Glass Land (I think it was the White Queen). Anyway, Alice is at her house, and the baby turns into a pig. I really wish they would've kept these scenes in the video release. Oh well, beggars can't be choosers. It's still a great movie, buy it anyway."
3,Unique,"That DVD is a very nice insight into the unique approach of Pina Bausch. Those teenagers are touching with their sensitivity, their blockages, their boundaries... Pina pushes them all out of their comfort zones!"
1,It's a doorstop,"First the clock wouldn't stay set--neither manual nor auto. The sleep timer never would count down. Then the indicator lights would come on, but no picture or even light from the screen. The only way to make it stop humming was to unplug it because the the power switches on the unit and the remote wouldn't work. Then it wouldn't turn on at all. All within a two week period. The only service center in Nashville is closed, so I made repeated calls to the 800 number where friendly people told me to ""fax Fernando and wait 14 working days for a response"". There's been a different excuse every time I've made a follow-up call. If someone offers you this worthless huge, incredibly heavy doorstop for free, ask them what you ever did to them to deserve such abuse."
1,displeasure with the bike/motorcycle mount,I was very dissapointed with the mount that was stated for use on a motorcycle/bike/atv. My explorist 200 was lost during a ride due to the fact that the mount is totally unsuitable for any type of bike mounting because it does not hold the unit well . Had it a velcrow or other type fastener to securely hold the unit to the mount then maybe I may have still had my navigator to enjoy. The only thing my mount is good for now is to remind me not to purchase another Magellan product. I cant even use the mount as a cup or can holder.
3,"It is fun, but the PC version of Duke Nukem 3d is better!","The two reasons why I suggest the PC version version is:1. You can download .map files on the internet, which means, MORE LEVELS!!2. The PC version is original, not ported.So if you plan to get this game for GBA, think again."
1,Naturopathy's Essential Vitalistic Spiritistic Woo-woo:,"I quote: ""[author quoting Lust, founder of naturopathy] 'naturopathy, with all its various methods of treatment, has always one end in view and one end only: to increase vital force' [p.003...] with natural foods, only, can be laid the foundation for the maintenance of a truly healthful and beautiful body, spirit and soul [p.165...] nutrition (like naturopathy), as a separate science [etc. p.180].""Vital force 'purposeful life spirit' is a science-ejected, superstitious figment. Naturopathy is a pseudoscience. Sectarian medicine rises from the dead!-r.c."
3,Good but you can do better for a bit more $$,"This is a nice cd. But the GOLD MEDAL COLLECTION ( 2 CDs) gives you a much better feel for his music. Better range and some good stories. If 20 years since his death you are looking for a ""essential collection"" get the GOLD METAL it is a much much better place to be."
1,essentials,"only good track is taxi... was hoping for more, but wow what a bummer. a real waste of 11.00$ hard to believe this is a professional entertainer."
5,inspiring,I bought this CD on a whim when I heard an interview with Teddy on the Kiss FM. It ended up being a great CD-- I like every song and for some reason when I listen to CD it inspires me to be more creative. It's amazing how a 17 year old kid sings and writes with so much emotion
1,John Mayer sound-a-like & elevator worthy.,"This was the most predictable crap that I've heard in a while (that's saying a lot). If you like songs where you can guess exactly how the song is going to turn out from just hearing the intro then this is for you. You can tell some manager/agent sat down in a boardroom and decided that the world needed a John Mayer clone because Mayer is doing the SRV blues thing right now and there's money to be made off of teenage girls selling this junk. This is elevator music...it's pointless, heartless music made by business men with a smiling face to sing it."
3,very camp,"Unfortunately, not only camp but also no subtlety at all. Not sure why they wasted energy on this; Brisco County is a much much better series."
3,"I think Bruce Campbell is brilliant, but the show lacks something???","*JACK OF ALL TRADES - DVD""I'll make this short. It's whitty and funny, at times, but I just kept feeling like something was missing. Perhaps it's because the show is only 22 minutes long each and there's not enough character development? Anyway, overall it's not bad, but there's way too much verbal porn with sexual inuendos in almost every line. To me that's what really ruined this series.*NOTE* NOT FOR KIDS! ! !My favorite part of the show is the intro theme and the theme song, it's brilliant. Too bad it's the only thing the kids can watch. Again, Bruce is brilliant."
4,Campy fun,"Love Bruce Campbell. Never saw this show on TV, but took the risk because of his other work. Campy, but entertaining. Good distraction when I'm on the elliptical trainer."
3,"Great concepts, marginal examples",The book provides a good conceptual overview of how to do TCP/IP programming but some of the examples are flawed and don't work as the text specifies.
2,Zero New Riffs,"Disappointing to say the least. It's just more of the same riffs from the first two albums rehashed with considerably less vocal talent over the top of them. I realize now what truly put The Towers of Avarice over the top for me was original singer, Eric Rosvold. As long as you have Towers and Metamorphosis, you don't need anything else."
5,A Documentary Well Done,"The production value was very good. It is amazing how the Garcias did so much with so little. The visuals were beautiful and unhurried. The interviews were engaging. And the focus on the purpose of missions was powerfully motivating. Perhaps this was summed up best by missionary pilot Matt Allen:""Why do I do what I do? I love people, but more importantly I love my God. From a natural standpoint this doesn't make any sense, but I'm here because God wants me to be here. There's nowhere else I would find happiness, than right here where God wants me to be.""I look forward to the next film.If I may make two suggestions:Including an interview with both the husband and wife together would be valuable and offer insight.Also, I hope that they will continue to focus on missions and missionaries. They might consider one on a missionary right here in the states - New York City would be good. One on missions to an Islamic nation would be enlightening as well."
3,suprise,No academy award here but surprisingly good for a low budget flick. Stories are tighter than expected acting...meh. overall don't regret giving a look.
4,Great Book,"Lots of facts, tech tips and specs. Not boring. Great book. I keep it on my phone for reference. Recommened."
1,Short-changed,"I saw the original miniseries on t.v. It was quite good. However, the vhs tape I recieved thru amazon.com was cut by 50% or more which totally ruined it. To anyone viewing it for the first time, it wouldn't make any sense. The continuity is so chopped up all we're left with is a collection of seemingly unrelated events. The scenes that were left out connect everything together and also were very interesting as well. I don't like anybody deciding what is enough for me to see. Especially at $19.95 a crack plus shipping"
3,"Good Acting , Sad Story",I expected to see more of the genius and contributions to aviation but this focuses less on his rise and more on his disfunction and fall. I thought It was a well done period piece. Just not my taste In movies.
3,Valiant and Commendable Effort,"This book is not well written but the story is good but its borrowed isn't it? I find myself wanting to find out how it ends as opposed to enjoying the moment. A story from Arabian Nights cries out for the jewelled words, dancing elephants, and bursting bombastic speeches. It is nonetheless a valiant effort by someone not from that region and maybe his rendition is perfect for the western reader who perfers sparse words, less speeches, less ceremony, and more story and intrigue. Dont get me wrong its an enjoyable read for its simple language for the subway, beach, plane, or a dentist's waiting room. I was disappointed because i expected so much more."
3,Works ok for me,"I initially got these for my girlfriend who was having trouble sleeping. She says that they help her stay asleep. For me, they really don't do much. I can take two before bed and sleep like crap, and the next day sleep fine with out them. As always they work different for everyone. Worth a shot if you are having sleeping troubles. Oh yea, they smell terrible."
3,no idea if it works or doesn't,"took fairly large doses on several occasions, in vain, i might add. smells like a thoroughly homogenized mixture of smegma, stool, urine, body odor, and that gunk under your toe nails. which is what probably sits between those two half cylinders of gelatin."
5,"If you like Carr's Alienist, then you MUST read this book.","I wrote this review awhile back but never left me e-mail address on it. It should say something that I am still thinking about this book and I am still waiting for J. D. Christilian to write another. This book was fantastic.After reading Carr's Alienist and Prince of Darkness, I went on a hunt for similar content in books. The bookstore employee recommended this book and I can't thank her enough. In many ways, this book is more captivating than the Alienist and as another reviewer put it, much shorter and yet just as exciting.If you like period writings about New York City, want the excitment of your imagination going back to the 1800's and getting into the story as if you were tagging along with the characters, then this is a must read."
5,Phonics Practice Readers Set A (10 Books),"This set is excellent to help a beginning reader build confidence with easy to read phonics books. Most phonics books have many words throughout the book that the child needs assistance with, in these books the child is able to completely read independently, only teaching one or two memory words at a time. I have used these in my preschool(ages 3-5) class for many years these books allow the child to begin a love for reading through the independence they gain. Excellent choice for parents, preschool, and K Teachers."
5,William likes gay z ? lmfao!!!,"Diz gay person William dwyer is into gay z ? Thats laughable main. He goes to even say that blueprint & blueprint 2 are better then nas's ""lost tapes"" is he fo real, yo? Nas is one of the best lirycist in the game besides, guru,rakim,raskass and biggie...If you think gay z is better ? Your an idiot. Gay z is garbage. Reasonable doubt was weak and that was gay z's best. Foget dat homo William dwyer coz he prolly listings to some eminem and nstync too."
2,Leave 'em where you found 'em,The Lost Tapes are just as weak as the last few Nas albums. This is not the return of anything great. I'm still waiting for something that even closely approaches Illmatic. Doo Rags is a pretty good track but the others were boring. Don't get me wrong-Nas is still one of the most clever lyricists to pick up a mic. It's just that songs like 'The World Is Yours' and 'One Mic' don't come outta him as much as they should. God's Son is about to drop. Here's hoping....
5,Could't have done the job without it,"Last winter I decided to take on the job of finishing my basement. I am happy to say that the basement is almost finished and the reason is this nailer. I used it to turn my basement into 5 rooms and it performed flawlessly. I bought a box of 4000 nails and used well over half of them without a single jamb.Some of the reviews talk about the nailer double shooting. That was not a problem for me. The nailer has two settings on the trigger, one for single shots and one for multi shots. I simple set the trigger to single shoot nails.The nailer was comfortable, easy to aim, and problem free.One of the few things left to do is install the moulding for which I am going to buy a Porter Cable finish nailer. In my opinion they make a quality product and sell it for a reasonable price."
3,"Haven't received it yet, backordered","Received nails without the nailgun to use them. Wanted to get busy last week, but no tool, so the lumber sits under a tarp."
5,An excellent read with beautiful photographs...,"A great review of the development of the 911 from the ""901"" through the 997. The book traces the history of the 911 through its generations. This is a must-have book if you own a Porsche or dream of owning one. The quality of the photos is excellent and the writing is thoughtful. Some good historical background make this an enjoyable book to read. Street cars and race cars are covered. Putting together a concise, and yet, fresh history of the Porsche 911 is a hard feat... Mr. Leffingwell did it! I highly recommend it."
1,"Terrible Read! Really Boring, Dry, and Technical","This book is so boring that it's really hard to get through. It's like reading a reference book. There are very few interesting points and, on top of that, there's no attempt to make it read well. It's just a compilation of prior news accounts, with a few short comments here and there, strung together. Very badly written and just a very slow, boring read. I kept reading because I thought it might eventually pick up but it never did and it was excruciating to get through.There's been press on the last chapter about the Saudis--and the last chapter does read much better--but BEWARE--the last chapter is really, really short. Do not judge the rest of the book by the last chapter--the rest of the book is incredibly boring to read and written in a totally different way. Also beware that the last chapter doesn't add much to the story the author's given in interviews since it's so short."
4,nails,I really like the nailer but can only find two size nails ..............is there anymore? .............there should be
5,Great for cleaning fretboard.,"This cleaner forks fantastic for cleaning the fretboard of a guitar, and helps keep fretboard wood from cracking. I use it every time I change strings. Great product for taking care of your equipment."
1,pages missing,i have reordered this book two times. it has pages missing. i raise bobby calves and the crucial pages that i index are missing. i am assuming that this book is not available complete which makes it useless. it was given to me as a gift from my son who spent somewhere in the neighborhood of 140.00. he is out the money and i am dissatisfied.
5,A stunning film in every way,"This film is done with the tender heart and soul of all involved in its making. Its beauty is seen, heard, and felt on many levels. You can read the synopsis anywhere, I'm just so taken with this film that I want to share the experience. It was like seeing 'The Wizard of Oz' for the very first time to me. Embrace it's simple yet complex wonder."
5,Aesthetically pleasing and endearing,"This film became an absolute must for my film collection after watching it once with my family. The child actor, Catinca Untaru, is the centerpiece of this film. Her lovely Romanian accent, her naive mischievousness, and her chemistry with the other characters endear any viewer to the story. In addition to her presence, the film's scenes are breathtakingly beautiful, apparently without any special effects, and the richness of the colors and landscapes alone would make this film worth watching. However, the storyline is also intriguing, as are the nuances within the storyline that, while sometimes slightly disturbing (e.g. violence, tribal rituals, depression), hold the viewer's interest. I would recommend this film wholeheartedly, as would my entire family, because it inspires creativity with its exploration of the imagination."
2,the fall falls flat,"The Fall falls flat and while it has superb picture quality and a dynamite sounding sound track, the story is as flat the the picture and sound are vibrant. Too bad, I bought this sight unseen based on a fabulous trailer, if only they could have maintained the quality and intrigue of the trailer another 90 minutes or so..."
5,"A fantastic, tragic story. An amazing book.","If you are a little suspicious of the medical profession and if you fear the day when you have to take a loved one to a hospital please read this. Or better yet, give it to whomever might be taking you. This is not only alarming but it is a wonderful personal love story. It puts it all in perspective. If you want to read a great book that nobody seems to know about, this is a great discovery."
2,People at Slumberjack should go camping more often,"Yes, sure, this bag will keep you warm although I find the rating at 20 a bit optimistic. But it lacks important features that make camping life much easier:1. The compression bag sold with the sleeping bag has no zipper, which makes it very difficult to put it back inside.2. Lack of small zipped pockets to put away ear plugs, keys, watches, and so on.3. Nothing to hang the bag in order to dry it or make it breathe after use.I would not have complained if no other bags on the market had these features..."
5,All Methed Up In Texas,"I think this is the best JM record since Where'd You Hide The Body. Signature story songs, many about cooking up meth in the Texas brush country. Funny, sad, deadpan, dead on.I just saw James plat last night to a full club on a Monday night in Washington. The crowd was rocking and bopping and singing along. Six albums gives JM a deep repetoire of great songs, and I was surprised at just how many people seemed to know all the words to all the songs. Saint Mary is his most rocking album to date. Try it out and find out why he is considered a legendary American songwriter. And check out his live show, you will not be disappointed."
4,Great tool but...,"I went ahead and bought one of these as a fourth gun even though I like Senco guns better. It's not bad for an import. I never have trouble setting the nail with it. I really like the adjustable exaust. I also like the rubber grip.What I don't like about it, is that it's made in Taiwan. It's quite loud and rough in operation. It has a lot more kickback than a Senco. Other than that it's a good tool. Since I like having the best , I kind of wish I had spent a little more on another Senco or Hitachi."
2,"First one lasted 6 months, replacement lasted 2 years....","When it was installed and working I was very pleased. But, six months after having it installed it failed.Plumber replaced it for free. The replacement lasted a little over two years.. Warranty expired... Word of caution, it does what they claim but the quality is below average and if you are content to fork out a couple hundred dollars every few years for instant hot water that's your call.."
4,Very entertaining,"I happened upon this series by chance, and have become rather a fan! Wildman is very enthusiastic as a host and it's an unusual approach to learning about the history of different places. This is fun to watch and more entertaining than many history programs that simply list facts with low-budget re-enactments."
5,Golden & Gorgeous,"I am so glad to see these recordings reissued into an affordable set. Dohnanyi's Dvorak evokes the sunniest spirits without forgetting to point out the storm clouds that occasionally move in. His performances retain some wonderful nuances such as the slight hesitations before cadences. Whatever the reasons, Dohnanyi's Dvorak is absolutely golden and gorgeous.Dohnanyi and his Clevelanders extract extraordinary vibrancy, detail and songful spirit from these works. Each symphony recorded here is a testament of the Clevelands balance of precision and power."
2,Now made in China,"They seem to work decently, but since they are now the same Chinese tool Husky puts out, it's off to ebay for older models."
2,It kept going on and on.,I read it in the 4th grade I think and it bored me. I got tired of it. It seems like everytime I read a boxcar children book I don't like it. I guess it is just personality!
5,PowerMax 3500 Generator,I just received this generator and am very impressed with the build quality. Excellent price and with free shipping it's the best deal I've found. Shipped from MaxTool and came in the day they said it would. Started with the first pull and runs so much quieter than my old one. Only time will tell if it holds up well but as I mentioned the build quality is there so I expect it will do nicely for my purposes as an emergency generator and occasional use with my travel trailer. Manual and parts book easy to read. Very nice features included on this unit.
5,The best recording of this music that I've heard.,"I grew up listening to rock and country (Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, Beatles, Who Hendrix, Stones, Poco, etc.) However, we had one album in the house that didn't fit our ""usual"" listening preferences. That was my mother's copy of London Records Phase 4 recording of Stanley Black and the London Festival Orchestra doing Rhapsody in Blue and American in Paris. I agree with the reviewer who said this recording stands above all other recordings of this material. All you music lovers... You owe it to yourselves to have this recording in your collection. The recording quality and performances are brilliant."
1,Great idea... poor quality,"I have gone through 3 of these heaters in the last few years. I was attracted to the design, and Hydor is about the only company making inline heaters.Unfortunately I had all three fail. Two failed silently (stopped working, temp dropped on the tank) and the last one failed catastrophically and cooked everything in the tank.Since I don't want to lose all my fish and shrimp again, I have gone back to the Eheim Ebo Jager in tank heaters. I have never had a problem with them. The only reason I changed was the slick design of the Hydors."
1,Voltage is not universal it is v120,Although the product is what I need I thought it is working in country which have v240 current. I did check if there is any hint about that in the description but couldn't find. I was disappointed hope in the future amazon take care about that since it is international market place.
4,Comfortable golf shoes,These leather shoes are very comfortable even new out of the box. It is also stylish. Also got it for great sale price if you don't mind not having brand name shoes.
2,Broken glasses,I had two sets of these glasses sent. Only one of them got there safely the other was in many pieces and was rejected. Amazon only recently informaed me they had gotten the return and creditted my account. These were sent prior to Christmas and should have been resent so they could have been there for the holidays.
3,Very Bad Bunny,"This book had a dirty cover and large crayon name printed on the inside cover. I really wanted the book, however, so I cleaned it up as best I could.This book was requested by my 24 year old son for his own 2 1/2 year old son. It was his favorite book - and his son loved it to. It tells how sometimes kids aren't as naughty as everyone seems to think - esp. when compared with a naughtier cousin."
2,Mellow... very mellow... too mellow.,"These days one might say it's like Kruder and Dorfmeister, but not as good. 20 years ago one could have said it's like 'Future Games'-era Fleetwood Mac, but not as good. Since it's from Japan, you wait for some sort of edginess or exoticism to poke out from between the comfy cushions, but it never does. If you really want something this laid back, try 'Quiet is the New Loud"" by Kings of Convenience instead of this expensive import."
5,My favorite tool,"The BN200A was my first pneumatic nailer. A friend recommended an 18-gauge nailer in place of the hammer and nail punch I had used up to that point. While in a high-end tool store, the salesman told me that the Porter-Cable BN200A was by far his best seller and garnered the most positive feedback - so I purchased one. Upon using it for the first time, I found it to be a very high-quality tool and it worked as well, if not better, than I hoped it would. I was also met with two pleasant surprises. The first was how strong the joint was; I could not easily pull apart two pieces of oak fastened together with a single brad. The second was how close to the end grain I could drive a fastener; setting a brad less than "" from the end of "" oak trim did not result in any splitting. This unit is powerful and reliable - not a single jam to date. I could not be more pleased with it."
4,"excellent tool, but ...","The tool itself has worked flawlessly for me, but the case is very unsatisfactory.The black buckle-shaped clips which lock the case are junk. On this case, and on two similar cases from Porter-Cable (for sanders), the clips broke after a short while and relatively little use. It seems to me that any first-rate manufacturer should ""recall"" and replace such low-quality parts, but instead Porter-Cable tells me I must buy more of the same if I want to fix the cases."
5,You gotta get you one of these!!!,"If you're into DIY you gotta have this brad nailer. I chose this model because of the reviews on Amazon...and they were right! I priced around at all the local home improvement stores and Amazon had the best price. I have an old air compressor so I was a little concerned about enough pressure but this nailer works great around 90 psi or even less. I've used it for trim, paneling, OSB subflooring, window casings, etc. It does a great job. It's very well made (looks and feels like a pro contractor model) and comes with enough brad nails for your first project and more. You gotta get you one of these!!!"
1,junk,"Real problems with this, don't waste your money. Judging from the UBISOFT web site forums a lot of people can't get this game to play, myself included."
3,Title says it all,"If you want to read about a congressman who left office no richerthan he entered it, this is it. This shows the kind of people thatmade this country the greatest one on earth one individual at a time."
4,"Really a good, interesting read!","I love to read history, etc. This is a very good book. I hardly put it down after I started it. If interested in Davy Crockett and or the period in our history, this would be an excellent choice."
3,Simmers sufficiently,"3 1/2Although its jammy technique can sometimes bear repetitious design, this is still top-notch Indian fusion featuring at least two virtuoso performers."
5,Review the product not the shipping,"We have used Riedel glasses for years. With Amazon Prime, they can be ordered and delivered in a day or two max. The prices are fair, and as we pay no tax (still?) in Texas for this, the price gets even better.The glasses themselves are beautiful, simple but elegant. I actually think the wine tastes better out of them. I am reasonably certain it is all psychological, but they are great to use every day or for a nice elegant event."
4,Vise Grip 11R 11-Inch Regular Tip Locking C-Clamp,"I use these 11R Vise-Grip adjustable C- clamp pliers all the time for welding and brazing. They have a 4"" capacity, but I find that I use them most often for clamping metal plate, angle iron and things in the range of 1"" to 3"" in thickness. I prefer this locking clamp over the similar 11SP type with the swivel pads, since I can get these into tighter places or even up close to the weld point if needed for more precise parts alignment without interfering with the line of sight for the weld bead. I do use the other 11SP C-clamps with the swivel pads for things like my Kreg jig and as a clamp for glue up on small wood projects, but these 11R clamps are my go-to clamps for metal work because I find they will pinch parts together very securely. I've actually used them for a ground clamp attachment point when MIG welding on occasion. Overall, I think these 11R locking clamps work well and would definitely recommend them to anyone that welds often."
5,The best pickles ever!!!,I grew up in NYC eating these amazing pickles. There is nothing like them. They have just the right crunch. They are a dill pickle but not too sour and with a touch of garlic. I am so thrilled to find them again! Now I can use the last jar I have had on my shelf for the last four years.
5,Perfect shower experience,I have had this shower head for years. I just added the shower arm http://www.amazon.com/Danze-D481116-13-Inch-S-Shape-Shower/dp/B000DZHE0G/ref=pd_bxgy_hi_img_b and a shower diverter for my hand held massager and now I have the perfect shower.
2,"Too difficult, not really fun","I love the concept of cooperative games, and had been wanting to try some from this company. I was really disappointed in how complex and hard to follow the instructions were, even for adults. We kept at it and finally got the hang of it, but once we did, we discovered it wasn't really much fun. My kids are 6 and 8."
3,I have this and the full sized Sabiston.,"I carried the baby Sabiston around during the first half of my surgical rotation, but found that the Surgical Recall handbook was better for those short reading spurts I would do while waiting for rounds or for a case. However, you do need a good text during your rotation, so try the full sized Sabiston text and skip the little Sabiston handbook."
5,condition of book,looks good. brand new. Amazon is asking too much by REQUIRING me to write 20 words worth of description. there's not that much to say about how the book looks. i haven't read it yet! seesh
5,A balanced view of Evil,"This is a great book with a balanced view of evil. This book is a shorter version of Satan and the problem of Evil, by the same author. This book presents a theology that explains the problem of evil in a way that the layperson can fully understand how a God of Love can also be a God of Wrath. It presents a realistic theology dealing with Satan and the fallen angels, and mankind's responsibility for evil in this world. This book does all these things while preserving and even expanding God's sovereignty, and demonstrating that men and women have a free will."
5,Fair to Midland,"This disc represents a significant addition to the existing Berlioz discography. It includes works spanning Berlioz's creative life, including his very first (real) work, the Francs-juges overture, all the way to some of his last, and the best of his overtures from in between. Not that he changed that much, but it's all interesting music nonetheless. The orchestral playing is good, and at times excellent. The recording is excellent, although perhaps a bit lumpy in the Corsaire. Overall it is well balanced, and captures the swimmy acoustics of the Montreal hall, yet every detail is nicely audible and elegant. Well worth it."
4,extra hand,This is the second I have owned. Versitile tool to clamp and hold. Threads on adjuster could have been a little tighter to keep a setting but a little teflon tape solved that. A good value.
4,funny !,"i love this book. my A.P Literature teacher assigned me this book in high school. It was funny yet interesting to read.I found out about Islamic culture (and to prove it was not a mockery, i asked my friend from Bangladesh and she laughed at it too because this book was true. )i recommend this book for mature readers obviously."
4,Reveiling the Iranian female,"Reading this book was so fun! The author takes you to an Iranian women's gossip circle, and openly exposes their secrets. The drawings are very funny and really speak out. It is a fun book with a layer of feminine pain. It's a good read."
3,read it at the bookstore...,"This book, while it is great, did not live up to my expectations. I read it in about an hour; there is a lot of filler (for example, multiple pages of ""Oh! Go on!"" being said by 9 people, instead of text that actually moves the storylines). While Satrapi has really turned me on to the genre of graphic novels and I can't seem to get enough of her work, Embroideries was somewhat disappointing."
1,Totally disappointed!,"I was so hopeful this would be the answer for heating my winterized tub for my 15"" pleco. It has not worked since we installed it. It can be turned up to 90*F and it will not heat to anything past 65*F (which is the temperature in the garage). I am very disappointed and would not recommend this product to anyone. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
4,nice pictures and good content,"Book is very appealing in its presentation of information, making it very enticing. Solid information presented in easily understood way , good for kids."
4,Still like the original,"Okay, so, I'm a diehard fig newton junkie and well, have been eating these things for 45 years. So, now that they're tons smaller than they were in the 60s, at least they haven't changed the taste. That is, of course, until you try these whole grain version. They are good, don't get me wrong, I just prefer the regular version. I think these lack quite a bit in taste. You can tell they're definitely whole grain but somehow, the fig flavor just gets a bit lost in there. You actually taste the whole grain part first, kinda like a bigger bun thing on your hamburger, rather than the fig portion. The fig is supposed to be the selling point, not the whole grain portion. These should be called, ""newton fig bars"" since the fig flavor is the afterthought here. Other than that, they're worth the try but if you're like me, just stick with the originals. They're still the best!"
4,Good Summer Fragrance,"Since there not too many reviews about this fragrance, I thought I might as well add mine in case other people were thinking of buying this. This is a pretty good fragrance, not mind blowing or anything out of the blue. It's def an aquatic fragrance and should be worn during summer/spring weather.Though it is aquatic, I find this one very appealing and unique. Has a very Citrusy smell and you can almost taste it. Though longevity is kinda weak. Maybe a good four hours at most. I don't think you can overspray yourself with this cologne. It's very refreshing and clean smell.A good alternative to this one would be PI NEO by Givenchy (will be my next buy later on) or Chrome Azzaro.Overall this is a very unique smelling fragrance and light so I use this as my work fragrance mostly or my casual going out during the day."
3,untitled,"Thibaudet is technically proficient, but he is sometimes not musical enough. But that's just my opinion."
2,Tuner lockup and poor Customer Service response,"Brought home set and tuner locked up over channed 99 using local wow cable. Called Mitsubishi customer service and all they could say was contact local service, which could not get out for 2 weeks. Had another set delivered, same model same problem. Spent hours on phone with customer service (Mitsubishi)all they could say was there was a tuner problem. Determined that the most recent software was installed. Mitsubishi Senior agent would not even have courtesy to return calls. Took the set back and bought another brand.Consider another model due to lack of customer service."
1,Lucky,"Wow. This was a horrible movie. It was boring, and very hard to sit through the entire movie. I kept thinking that it would get better, but it never did."
3,Not one of Ms. Balogh's best,"Ms. Balogh is one of my favourite writers for regency novels but this is indoubtly not one of her best as the heroine is somewhat boring (because it seems that she doesn't really know what she wants), and so is the hero. There are too many peopole involved in the plot. The whole plot is not very convincing anyway: a girl has to choose her husband from her five cousins because it was her grandfather's last will. Though: still better than most other regency novels. I'd say, only read it if you haven't got any other Mary Balogh books at hand."
2,not what i expected...could have been better,"I was so psyched about reading this novel back in '2003' and as a result I was disappointed. A great adventurous romantic story about Cara and Maximillian, a duke who refuses to accept his title. Unfortunately, the plot itself was quite predictable and the love scenes were too tame and edited lacking in emotional expression."
3,From the back cover:,Who was Max Ryker? The sinfully sensual P.I. had the looks of a playboy and the bearing of a king. Bounty hunter Cara Rivers could only dream of being Cinderella for a night in Max's strong arms. Because she and Max were hunting the same man and that made Max the enemy. Duke Maximillian Ryker Sebastiani shunned his title. But Max had a duty to his king. Even the spirited beauty who challenged his every move couldn't keep Max from bringing the bail jumper back to the kingdom of Montebello. Not even if she was the one woman to stir the secret royal's reckless heart.
5,Totally entertaining!!!!!,"At least seven out of the ten songs on this album spoke to me on the spot. Tom has a wonderful gift for melody and song structure. The songs are sweet and pop filled, but messy enough to rock, sort of like the Beatles, Cars,and REM all jamming at once. Check out Expiration Date, Ma Say Ma, It Goes On, Seize and Strange New Ways and then you will be so happy you bought this album! Great Yellow Album!! Buy it!!!"
3,A strange book for an official guide,"""The Official Guide"" is a peculiar tag for this text. It doesn't teach the language nearly as comprehensively as the REBOL manual does. And for a language pegged as being for Internet messaging, it is odd to see the network aspects of REBOL shoved near the back of the book. What this book does is teach REBOL by a rather large example. While the example is a good one, and there is lots of good information throughout the book, I still find myself preferring the REBOL/Core manual."
1,Tasted NOTHING like at a Mexican restaurant,"I bought this thinking it would taste at least a little like the restaurants version. It was NOTHING like it. I tried it with the water first. It doesn't even tell you how much liquid to add, just a glass of water and one tbsp. of the mix. I used a large glass. It was horrible so I added another tbsp. It was still REALLY bad. It was so watery. Then the next time I used skim milk (only because that's what's in my house). This tasted better, but nothing I'd want to drink again. Also it says on the package in the picture 'sweetened,' and it says it has sugar in it and my package was, so I agree with the other lady as to why people assume it's not sweetened when it clearly is. I would NEVER buy this again."
3,A look at Ancient Troy,"This book was immensely entertaining. It's a retelling of Homer's classic epic ""The Iliad"", through the eyes of Achilles' slave/concubine, Briseis. The story is the same enduring tale that has become a classic over the years. However, it sometimes reads like a cheesy romance novel. In my opinion, there were too many sex scenes that were really not related to the plot. I like a good sex scene as much as anyone, but it's a bit too much in this book, which is the reason it only gets three stars from me.If you are interested in this book, I would recommend that you instead check out Marion Zimmer Bradley's ""The Firebrand"", which is a similar novel in that it's a retelling of the Iliad through the eyes of a minor character - Kassandra (Cassandra), Hector's sister - only the writing is much better."
1,"Awful title for the story, awful story","I expected better.The title should not be Daughter of Troy, as the character is in Troy only once, and not a Trojan. All this story is Briseis going from one man's bed to another and how she likes or dislikes it. To say this is a story of any character in the Trojan War, or the tale of Troy,is wrong and although Briseis is nothing more than a war prize, the character portrayed here is quite arrogant, slutty and fond of herself, thinking every man wants to take her home. I would think the characters of Homers legend had more to think about than her. Read it if you want a sad, trashy romance novel, not if you are interested in the Trojan War or good literature."
5,The kids here have so many layers to them!,"I love Elsie - her intelligence, her decency, her pain & anger. The characters in this book jump off the page & seem like people I've either known & felt strongly about or WISH I knew. Elsie's mom is one of the more fascinating moms I've read about - not sympathetic, not likable, but REAL. Her 2 ""love interests"" are both good solid guys, but you find yourself strongly rooting for...well, read it and see. This book is special - quite a few notches above the usual Young Adult fare, with memorable characters and a deep understanding of adolescence & how one never REALLY gets over one's childhood...you carry it with you wherever you go."
3,This one was a little boring...,"I like all the Fab. Five books, so I am not going to give any of them low ratings, but this one was a tad weird. All the kids at Wakemen are upset when a bunch of 9th grade bullies trash their school and then 'our generation' is blamed for it. So the Fab. Five want to show that not all kids are bad, so they decide to raise money for repairs by writing to celebrities and asking for donation that they can auction off. Also, Beth is having problems with her boyfriend, but I don't care a whop because Keith is a jerk anyway. If you love this series like me and haven't yet read this book, don't fret. You're not missing much. FROM A LOYAL READER"
1,so so,"""The Way I Am"" is about the only popular song on the c.d. The rest of the songs in my opinion...z-z-z-z. sry"
4,Catchy tunes,This is a great album ... most of the songs have a catchy beat. I enjoy listening to this album while working around the house with children present.
2,Buy the Soundtrack Instead,"I'm an avid Hole fan and try to get my hands on anything they release; that's the only reason I bought this. The P.O.D. song is good, too, but it may be better to just spend the money buying the whole Any Given Sunday soundtrack since this single has only 3 songs on it, two of which are different versions of ""Be A Man."" The two versions do not sound distinctly different. One is the ""radio edit"" and I think the only difference is a few deleted cursewords. It's an awesome song, worth owning, but this single contains no photos or info a Hole fan would be looking for."
3,What Kit?,"Please don't be misled by the title. I don't know why they would sell or advertise this stapler as a kit! All it comes with is the gun and nothing but the gun! No case, no staples to test the gun! I would have given it 5 stars otherwiseOtherwise, it is a good stapler. Works very well like all others have described."
3,"Stapler is fine, but where is the hard case?","This review is going to be short. As expected from PC, this is a nice tool that does exactly what it is supposed to and advertised. I had no problems from that aspect. So, why not a top score? Well, if there is any thing that is harmful to a pneumatic tool, that must be the exposure of the tool to saw dust and other particles that are flying around in the air. Saw dust and particle production is at it's top when the nailer is not being used. Because, I am usually sawing, routing, sanding, etc. I'd like to keep my tools in their boxes so that saw dust can not get to them. I have several PC nailers and this is the first one that came without a case. I hope that folks from PC read this review and the three stars catches their attention. I am willing to pay the extra few $ and get the case. It helps keeping me organized and my tools nice and clean. I think many would agree with me on this!"
3,"Nice stapler, but where is the case?","PC really cheaped out on this one. A plastic case would be nice, the cardboard box is not very hardy!"
5,excellent stapler,I bought this to replace one exactly like it that I have been using for 7 years. It broke because I FORGOT to oil it and the inside rusted....In conclusion take care of your tools and this is an excellent one.
5,"The weathervane rocks - or in this case, it spins!",We haven't put it up on the garage roof yet. We live in Northwestern Pennsylvania - and there's snow on the roof! But it's going to be great.
2,Poor quality,I agree with the others these are cheap. I have older USA made vise grips that even after years of abuse are still stronger and tighter than the new off-shore copy. The steel on these new ones is softer and the rivets get looser by the day.
1,Fun game,Fun game if it worked. I don't know why I can't post anything about this game or vendor I bought this from.
4,Classic racing game.,"This game is quite fun and entertaining but there r some negitive things about it. First since the track is not completley a perfect oval it makes the graphics worse than they can be. When u fall off ur bike it makes u mad because it happeneds quite frequently and its annoying when u r close to finising the race in first. The sound can also get annoying too but this is an old game and they did not have good enough sound to make the bike have more than one tone. The last thing is that the track gets very tiering to go on it over and over again. But i love how the track is not just a plain circle, it has ramps and bumps and all sorts of things. The multiplayer is also really fun too. I love battling friends and beating them. Other than those few negitive things it is a very fun game."
1,Know About this Brand before You Buy,"Horizon has been boycotted by the Organic Consumers Association and is the target of frequent complaints filed with the USDA because of their poor track record with regard to compliance with organic standards. Since they were bought by 12-billion dollar mega-corp Dean Foods, a large percentage of their organic dairy has been produced at factory farms, some with upwards of 10,000 cows.I was seriously irritated to discover that something so happy and innocent looking as the jumping cow on the Horizon label was a front for a billion dollar corporation. Much of the reason I buy organic is to support small, organic farms, and to protect the environment and animals from the practices of mega corporations like Dean. Even if Horizon becomes a model citizen when it comes to organic practices, the fact that it's owned by Dean means that if you buy Horizon, part of every dollar you spend is contributing to some of the worst factory farming practices in the country."
1,Check the SUGAR - stay AWAY,ORGANIC????? Are you out of your minds? The product is soooooo sweet!!!!! It is a killer! I am surprised that people buy it! I tried it once when my little had it - that was it.... Stay away from this organic sugar bomb!!!!
2,Major rip-off!,"Sure, organic milk is best, but only an idiot would buy milk from Amazon. Do the math, and you'll realize at the price per ounce here you'd be paying over $22 for a gallon of organic milk. That's pure stupity! Not to mention all of the waste produced by the individual containers! Organic milk sells in grocery stores for between $5 and $10 a gallon, and even raw organic milk sells for about the same!"
3,Drinkers beware,"I'm not a scientist and definitely not a researcher so I cannot prove what is inside this organic milk but whatever it is, I'm allergic to it. I'm okay with regular milk but 1) regular milk does not taste as smooth as organic and 2)it's obvious to me that my mood elevated with regular milk. (w/ multiple brands). After trying out few organic milk brands (Horizon, Sunnyside, Organic Valley & Heritage), I have to admit, Horizon is the only one that I have allergic reaction to (itchy skin). I don't know what's inside this milk but my body just cannot tolerate it. After doing a little research, I learned that they were not constant with their, ""proven organic"" but anyways, this is the brand I will avoid forever. If it works for you, then cheers! But if there are other brands (Heritage, Clover, Stonyfield) available on shelf, I would prefer those over Horizon...especially for the baby."
4,Great Tasting Milk,"I have to admit that at first I felt like I was just paying a premium for the word ""organic."" However, upon actually drinking the product and seeing the longer shelf life I realized that the nominal amount I paid was well worth it.ProsThe milk tastes fresher and smoother than regular non-organic milk.The shelf life is almost 2 months longer than regular non-organic milk & does not require refrigeration until you want to drink it (recommended but not required) or after you've open it.The container is portable and keeps milk cool long after you take it out of the fridge.ConIt does cost more than non-organic milk.It is probably less expensive to buy the Horizon brand gallon sized milk at the store."
2,Doesn't compare,"Ok so understand that I am a big Prince of Persia fan. I adore the games a lot but this game was a huge disappointment. The problem wasn't the Prince or the plot (although I felt it was a little weak). The problem lay mostly with the interface of the game. The game felt rushed, it wasn't up to parr with the other games. There were a lot of issues with controls, camera, and fighting.The fighting was the worst, it didn't flow like it did before and felt choppy and uncontrollable. They added so many new fetters they didn't have time to explain them all so you were left wondering what to do and how to fight. The way I ended up fighting was using the same move over and over again just hoping I wouldn't be cut down while I waited for the Prince to actually perform the action.Basically unless you can get the game for less then $3 I wouldn't bother."
4,Old game - but new to you,"The current Prince of Persia game may have graphics that exceed everything previous. But this earlier adventure with the prince is still engaging. The storyline and gameplay have aged well. I especially like the problem-solving situations and the smooth blending of action and movie-sequences. Keep up the good work, Ubisoft."
4,Clearly lays out the issues and presuppositions,"The Wedge of Truth is one of the better critiques of the presuppositions of most evolutionary theory today. Phillip Johnson brings out in a clear and concise manner the thought processes of many biologists and others who advocate an evolutionary understanding of biological and cosmological development. The key thought in this work is the hammering home of the notion that most science done today assumes a naturalistic outlook from the start, rather than attempting to accommodate other philosophical presuppositions. This has been Johnson's theme for some time now with respect to evolutionary thought, and this book lays his thinking out quite clearly. This is an excellent book for undergraduate students, as it is not so overly technical as to lose the reader, and yet it brings out the fact that there is a need to seriously re-think our approach to scientific statements with respect to origins."
2,I just couldnt get into this album,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge genesis fan and I was really looking forward to hearing this, that being said I found this cd to be mediocre at best and plain bad at worst. The writing was uninspired and the singer was average. To be perfctly honest Im a little suprised by all the glowing reviews, someone put this on there top three albums of all time list! I tried to like this but I just couldnt get into this album."
3,Jams Galore,"I have many Porta-Cable tools and have always been extremely happy...until now! The Porta-Cable roofing nailer looks great and has many features that make it appealing. But, when I used the nailer my problems started. It jammed much to often. The first day I had at least a dozen jams. It wasn't easy getting the jammed nail out which added to down time and $$$$. I thought maybe the coils were bad, so the next day I used brand new coils and continued to have jams. After adjusting, oiling, etc. I continued to get frustrated with jams, so I sold the gun at a garage sale."
1,I've tried...,"so hard to finish this book.I have read between 50 and 60 Red Dress Ink books and can't put them down. But I have started this book about 3 times, and can't get through it. There is way too much detail, and the poetry really detracts from the story at times. I am sure that I will try to get through it again (it bothers me that it sits on my shelf unread). Maybe her other book ""Sleeping Over"" is better..."
4,Vise-Grip Pinch-Off Pliers,"I have had a pair of these Vise-Grip pinch-off pliers for years and have found them to be very well made.The Yellow Jacket #60666 are the exact same Vise-Grip branded pliers in a blister pack with their name on it which YJ sells at a substantial markup.These pliers have a maximum 1/2"" tubing capacity, but I find that I usually need to take multiple bites and readjust the tension screw between each pinch to close off a line that size. With smaller lines like 1/4"" though, I can often pinch them closed with just one good squeeze of the handles."
3,Weak Biology Section!,"According to the guide at dentalschooladmission.com the biology section is weak and I agree since I have the Kaplan book! You need another guide for biology. Also, the CD test is not too representive of the DAT format but our choices are limited in software products.Michael"
5,it really works,"i really thought ""why are you doing this"" when i ordered this, but after 2 weeks my leg that looked like a road map has improved alot. will continue to take this"
5,Sheer delight,"Wonderful music all round. Typical light Shostakovich in mixing sweet and fun mood with darker, more nostalgic feelings.Superbly performed and recorded too.I first got this in 1997 when it first came out. I have lots of great CDs of light Shostakovich works which overlap somewhat, but this is probably my favourite of them of all.The Cheryomushki excerpts in particular are so wonderful."
1,Take a pass and save $30.,This book teachs you NOTHING you can't figure out on your own by simply playing with the iPod. Don't waste your $30.
4,"I Agree, the best in the series so far.","I do agree that this is the best Sister Frevisse mystery I've read so far, but they have been getting better and better. I found that this one moved a lot quicker than previous ones, and that was because of the many plots and subplots that were interwoven in the fabric of the story. I also enjoyed the realistic look at medieval English village life. It also is well-researched and gave us a clear idea of what illness outbreaks were like back then. In this book the little village is hit with a measles outbreak, and many children get sick. Another thing that I liked about the book was that it was out of the nunnery entirely. In this book, Sister Frevisse is actually out in the village trying to do the job of the bailiff while he is under house arrest for an allegation of being a villein (serf) on the lam. We meet some very interesting characters and as usual Ms. Frazer's dialogue is crisp and intelligent. An excellent addition to the Sister Frevisse stories."
4,THANKS!!!,"Picture on the item that I was ordering was different, minor difference, the picture that I made my order from had a leather tape thong and a red, plastic stop. The one I received had an all metal chain tape thong. Other than this MINOR difference item was shipped on 9/23 and arrived 9/29. Very fast!"
2,Soap Opera Horror,"All My Children meets The Exorcist.The world famous mentor with a dirty childhood secret. The extraordinarily handsome, conflicted Jesuit with a troublesome libido. The gorgeous upscale girlfriend and her feisty teenage daughter. The beautiful reporter with an oddball first name who discovers she wants to be hurt in bed by the rugged bad boy, even though she thought she loved his sensitive but deceased brother. Plus half a dozen stock throwaways whose sole function is to advance the plot.The only original character in the entire book is Jesus in Bluejeans, and he's pretty darn good looking too."
5,I love this cookbook & I'm not a vegetarian!,"Everything I have prepared from these recipes has been wonderful. The dishes have so much flavor, you don't miss the meat. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to eat healthy."
5,Sweets for Sweden is Very Sweet,"I first heard this CD while visiting family in Sweden. I thought it was wonderful and had songs that I had never heard before. It's truly an amazing work of art. Of course, it's Roy and he is amazing. Well worth the money."
3,"Good one, but 80's versions","If you are looking for a basic Orbison compilation, you should probably go for the standard one rather than this. This is a great compilation, but unfortunately it doesn't entail any of the classic 50's and 60's versions of the songs. But hey, this is still a great CD! Roy's voice never faded."
1,Wish Porter Cable / Delta designers read these reviews,"I have been loyal to the Delta and Porter Cable brands all my life. My Dad used these tools when he was a young man starting his own business and said they were reliable ""good tools""... Good enough for me. I bought the 19.2 volt combo system and have had 2 batteries fail in 2 years or less and I am just a hobbyist. I bought one battery when the first went bad because you really need 2 batteries. I resent having to pay $85 for another battery but have useless tools without them. They really need to do some thing for their loyal users to regain respect. The tools are good the batteries are junk. I had a 12 volt Panasonic unit for over 8 years and used it extensively prior to getting the Porter Cable. I only replaced it because the batteries finally gave out and replacements cost more than what I paid for the whole drill with 2 batteries. I think it's a plot!!!"
1,Watch out!,"I have owned the saw and drill combo for two years. Love the product performance, but I have to replace one battery of the original two and the second looks to go soon. I just came to reality to the replacement cost...Two new batteries for what I can purchase a new Porter Cable 1 3/4 horse router with plunger base.....Watch out before you buy the 19.2 volt systems....."
5,Good pedals,"To the contrary of what other people are saying I do not think that these are that heavy for its class. Plus I'm not sure why people would give it 3 stars because they are ""heavy""? Didn't you read in the specs and see how heavy they were? What did you expect? Did you expect that somehow they would become lighter during shipment?I like these pedals, they are well made, overall they have good performance, pretty universal I can ride my bike with clip-ins and with my regular snickers when need to. Sealed bearings means no maintenance is needed. Also because they have bindings on both sides I don't need to worry about turning them over. Also last but not least they are not made in China!!!"
5,Shimano PD- M242,"The Shimano PD-M242 SPD Pedals work great! For those of you that arent sure about if the plastic will hold up, vs just getting the metal ones- IT WILL. I do some pretty rugged mountain biking trails with a lot of banging around and the plastic shell is holding up great. Some people say that getting in and out of them isnt very smooth? Theres a screw on the front of the pedal that will allow you to tighten or loosen the grip to give you the best comfort possible. I would recommend these pedals to anyone looking for tough durability and reliability!"
5,The Best 7 1/4 Saw Out There. Period!!,"I have had this saw for a few years now and have done many jobs with it. Although, the day I got it I cut the cord with-in 30 seconds! He-He! I have used the Skil 77 saw which is also very nice, for cutting cement siding, it performs well but not like my Porter-Cable. If you are a contractor, the light weight and power is awsome! I love the table plate. These guy's definately took their time in designing this saw. I would HIGHLY reccomend it."
1,Hot Snake Nights.,"The Cover of the Book, Hot Snake Nights has nothing to do with what I have read. The reason I continued to read the book because I hate to leave a book unread. OMG this is a mess. The book was worth 50 cent."
3,The Love You Deserve,"This book was not the author I thought it was when I bought it. It is a good book, just not what I was looking for."
4,Making a purpose,All documentaries ought actually to reflect purposes they have been created for.This hardcore-sports-doco would have been much more interesting and much less boring if it has incorporated more info on Mark Bingham and his heroic act.
1,buy the craftsman instead,"do not waste your money on this item. the craftsman version (from sears) is far superior to this. it features a trigger action that allows you to open and close the clamp, which is really nice when you are holding something together with one hand and trying to set your clamp with the other. the craftsman for about the same price, even cheaper when on sale thru craftsman club, is hands down a better tool."
1,An old game retitled !!!! This was CHROME in 2003!!!,"Check out the VERY SMALL legal disclaimer on the inside cover of the box that says ""Also published as Chrome:Gold Edition"".There is nothing new about this game at all. Same gameplay, crappy AI and lame graphics. They just lumped in a few new levels/missions! What a total ripoff!Not only is this game poorly created, it was not even created. This game is CHROME, released in 2003. I played it and owned it. It was horrible. There are free mods created by amateurs for games you already own that outshine this game made by ""pros"".This game is the same company re-using an old game, they just retitled it to Advanced Battlegrounds.Don't waste your money or time. Send DreamCatcher a message, ""We gamers don't like being ripped off for a fast buck!"""
1,"sorry, I like Callas' better","No one should be allowed to sing this role. I have to say Callas is the only Tosca. True, Price has glorious voice. And Callas sounds harsh. But Tosca is a mean ***ch. And Price is just not that convincing. Tebaldi is another better Tosca than Price. I love Price and hate to give her a bad review, but this is not great."
1,Inferior quality,"These labels are thin and flimsy and tear easily. Moreover, they are not precise. They fit loosely on a standard labeling machine's small spindle, and the result is a sloppy looking, off-center label. To add insult to injury, Avery has a template on the Website for the 8960 label, but the actual label sheet directs you to use either of two template numbers, neither of which is 8960. I checked the Avery site, and the numbers are for templates that have nothing to do with this label.Neato labels are more substantial and precise. Unfortunately, Neato doesn't make the ""full"" DVD label with the small hole, so I guess the only solution is to go back to their CD-style big hole label."
5,Amazing!,"I was thinking that it would be great to put a label right unto the cd I had just copied for my friend. Didn't know one existed. So, I went on line to my favorite site ""Amazon.com"" and asked for a search of cd labels. Long and behold, within seconds I had quite a few choices. I chose the Avery 8960 Matte Full Face Label. It gave me a detailed description of what to expect. When I received it, I immediately tried it and voilla! I had a beautiful, colorful and detailed label. When my friend received the copy of the cd, she was astounded! (she was used to getting hand-written notes right on the cd). I bought Avery because of my past experience with this brand of labels (I use Avery products for all my label needs). I received my product as promised. I just love Amazon.com. I visit it often, and I'm NEVER disappointed."
3,Great Author published too soon,"Thomas H. Cook is one of our finest mystery writers, He bucks the usual trend and (except for a couple of early novels) has avoided the dreaded serial mysteries that have killed many a lesser talent (Patricia Cornwall to name just one). This novel catches him about two novels before he was worthy of being published. Compare this to ""Chatham School Affair"" or ""Breakheart Hill"" and pretend he never wrote this one."
3,It has some good nuggets of information,This book has some good solid nuggets of information. However it lacked some originality of some quality ideas. It had a decent core but missed the flavor of a great book.
4,Nice bit. But ....,"...it would've been a 5-star had I seen the words ""Made in USA"" on it instead of ""China"".This is an odd sized tap ...and difficult to find.It worked great for cleaning up the threads on some brake hoses I was installing on truck. Can't comment on its longevity but I suspect, based on the infrequent use I'll give it, it'll last me a lifetime."
1,NOT SO GREAT,THIS CAME IN MONTHS LATE. THIS IS NOT THE PROBLEM OF THE SELLER BUT IT CAME IN MANGLED FROM THE POSTAL SYSTEM AND I EMAILED THE SELLER WITH MY SITUATION AND THEY CHOSE TO IGNORE MY CONCERN. I WOULD HAVE RATHER HAD THEM TELL ME IT WAS NOT THEIR PROBLEM THAN TO IGNORE ME COMPLETELY.
1,Get another book,"I was looking for a book to help me and my son build a treehouse. It had some pretty pictures of bedrooms and some interesting ideas, but only provided one example of a treehouse. It had a few good pictures, but you have to use your own imagination to put this book to any use. There are better play structure and treehouse books on the market."
1,What you see is not what you get,Of the 128 pages about 120 pages were spent explaining how important it is for children to play and basic shop safety. The picture on the front of the book is as close to a child's play area as this book ever gets. I was very disappointed in the book and would not suggest it to anyone.
1,Color not as depicted!,"I was not at all impressed with this table! If I had seen the color of it before my husband had put the whole thing together, I would have returned it. Thank God it's going into a rental property and not my house! It is NOT your typical ""natural"" color of wood. The color is PEACH! IT IS ABSOLUTELY HORRID!!!"
3,"Not too hot, not too cold....","But not just right. The Barber is okay, though the second movement is awfully schmaltzy, and the third movement is indeed mechanical. I thought this was a fine recording, until I heard Hilary Hahn's. Now I don't play this one any more.The Walton is finely played, though I could have wished for a little more expressiveness."
2,Cell Phone Adapters doesnt fit Motorola phones.,The main reason I bought this was for it's supposed ability to recharge my Motorola cell phone in an emergency. Unfortunately the supposed Motorola adapter doesn't fit any Motorola device I tried.Generally the flashlight is better then some others I have seen.
5,Great always ready in an emergency.,Easy to power up. Long lasting after a good cranking. Two light level settings provide plenty of light. Doesn't require batteries and is always ready to go.
2,Average AD book,"Not sure what all the fuss about this book is over. I found the writing style to be dry and unimaginative. I found the chapters to be difficult to read and the explanations of the myriad of AD concepts to be quite difficult to follow at times.Overall, this is a book that is packed with the nuts and bolts of AD, I just can't make it past the desert dry writing and the poor conceptual explanations."
1,Look elsewhere if you want a real grammar.,"This is the most bizarre grammar I have ever seen. I havea strong background in linguistics and have read many, many grammars. This one is not a grammar at all in the usual sense of the word. It is more like an encyclopedia with every entry arranged alphabetically.Want to study Japanese syntax? Sorry, there is no entry for syntax, instead you must pick through the table of contents again and again to find the scattered references. Want to look at verbal morphology, well, there is a very brief entry on verb forms and then its back to more of the scattered references.I am keeping it only because its the best I have but somewhere,there MUST be a real Japanese grammar and when I find it, thisgoes to the used bookdealer ASAP."
2,Beware....,"Hey, if your the kind of person who likes to waste your money, go ahead. This book is extremely worthless, besides the fact that it has a decent cover.I like Japan. I like Japanese. But this book made me scared to buy any more Teach Yourself books. It divides the Units into tedious sections-Structure, which attemts to give helpful sentence structures as well as explanations on particles(e.g. wa,ka,no) and Language and Society, which is more geared to tourists.The explanations of the usage of particles enhanced my Japanese vocabulary none whatsoever. It gives you sentence examples and leaves the usage hanging out, blowing in the wind. I bought the Teach Yourself Beginners Japanese book by Helen Gilhooly and found it superior. She also wrote Beginners Japanese script which I found extremely useful."
5,The most amazing ending I have ever read,"This whole series is the best I've ever read in my entire life, and the ending was perfect: it will torture my soul til the end of my days, which essentially means it was extremely powerful!I have never come across a more complicated and more evolved character than Gerald Tarrant. He is hands down the most amazing fictional character, and this third book sealed the deal for me.The only complaint I have about this book is that half of it was taken up by characters other than Damien and Tarrant when all I wanted to do was read about those two, but hey, what can you do.I'd give this book 10 stars if I could."
5,better than ever,"the best of three! the ending is so unexpected, but at the same time throughout the whole book you're hoping for it. when it finally comes to the end, even though it's not actually stated, you're heart is bursting with joy. i was literally brought to tears at the events leading up to the ending, so when the ending finally came i was brought to tears of joy. this trilogy is definitely movie material ... though i'm not sure how they could make a good movie out of it. (holiday is notorious for leaving out the most important story details) if a good movie were to be made, each part would be three or four hours long, in order to fit everything in. but i would still pay every dime i have to see the movie if they made one."
2,buy Bryden Thomson's version,"I'm sorry to disagree, but this is a great symphony, agruably Bax's best, in a mediocre performance and murky recording. Especially disappointing is the all important third movement.The standard against which all performances must be judged is Bryden Thomsons Chandos version, followed by the recently reissued Dutton Barbirolli from 60 some years ago. The latter is a very different perfomance, marred some by the technical quality of this mono recording, entirely understandable for it's age.The chief virtue of this Naxos recording is it's price.Maybe people who haven't heard Bax before will but it, like it and go on the the magical, mystical, crystal clear Thomson recordings of the Bax symphonies."
4,"Morbidly funny, breezy, yet highly educational","This book tells you about all the dangers in the great outdoors and how you could possibly get sick and die from them. It describes in graphic detail all the symptoms you will experience from everything from jellyfish stings to polar bear attacks to tse-tse fly bites. For the morbidly curious, the book spares no gorey detail about diarrhea, vomiting, cramps, drooling, bleeding, and convulsing. In a very straight forward style and easy to understand terms, Tilton brings you specific information on these potentially dangerous plants and critters of the wilderness. He doesn't get bogged down in too much science, yet gives you just enough information to laugh, learn, and hopefully avoid the pitfalls contained in this hilarious yet educational tome. All learning should be this much fun."
1,Poor home work for Gill,"Gill is really superficial in this book. The overall story is quite fascinating, to say the least, but there are so many inaccuracies in the book that it should not have been published at all. I personally found the book unpleasant to read, because Gill had used the Finnish words for the most important terms. And mostly wrong. As a Finn, I find it troubling and makes reading uneasy. It also makes me wonder about other facts which have been presented in this book. I also did not understand why there was a photo of the former president Mauno Koivisto presented but no story attached. Maybe there was a reason?"
4,The Ultimate Warrior,"Gill's book deals with the life of Larry Thorne (Lauri Torni) who served in the Finnish Army during the Winter War, WW 2, and who later emigrates to America and joins the US Army Special Forces.Thorne serves in Vietnam and is listed as MIA (presumed killed in a helicopter accident).Thorne was one of Finlands most highly decorated soldiers.I feel that this is a book that is long overdue and that America has forgotten some of the colorful characters who were members of SF during the early days of its founding.Unfortunately the book is a bit superficial in it's detail on Thorne's WW 2 service and his later service in Vietnam.I am curious if that is because the author could not find more info on Thorne or that men who served with Thorne are still secretive about their activities conducting combat missions in Vietnam.I do recommend this book for those who are interested reading about this Finnish American hero who was a legend in the SF community."
2,Disapointed,"I was expecting great things after reading the other reviews, and ordered one soon after buying my sander from one of the big box home stores. I used the sander stock for a few days while waiting for the new wonder shoe to arrive in the mail, so I got a good feal for the sander before hand. While the graphite sanding shoe was a little smoother, it isn't holding up all. Almost imediatly, the shoe refuses to stay on correctly and gets twisted over to one side, the flimsy fabric backbone is not stong enough to keep the mounting hole from elongating. There should be some sort of metal bracket to hold everthing in place, but there isn't. I'm back to steel and cork and out $21."
2,Lot of problems,"First, I have several Swisher products and am satisfied with the quality of the other products. I now have the mower working but this is after at least two years of more repairing than mowing. Until I made a couple of modifications to the idler pulley, it was impossible to keep the drive belt on. There are other design flaws such as bolt placement that will interfere with the belts. I was going to complain about Swisher customer service but they actually called as I was typing this review and were very helpful."
4,great for everyday use!,"I really liked the design of this set. It has a fun and playful design which is great for everyday use. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because one of the sets, even though the same design was less bright then the rest. The greens and blues just weren't as brightly colored. More like they had some fading. Must be something that happened at the factory because from what I know, the colors will never fade. These were a great price too!"
1,Recording Quality Rips Off the Buyer AND Eddie Cochran,"I'm old enough to have heard Eddie's records when they were hits played on the radio (AM, of course), and have always loved his music. But I must give this CD a rating of ""1"" because of the astonishingly poor quality of the recording; it sounds like the 6th copy someone made of a bootleg 8-track, and a cheap 8-track at that. The 'engineers' who made this recording somehow managed to reproduce a sound that is at once muddy, muffled, AND twangy. It's un-listenable, no matter how much you might like Eddie Cochran. I'm sorry I contributed to their making money by exploiting a great, pioneering Rock & Roller. Skip this dog, and maybe look for something of Eddie's that doesn't contain the one word that should have tipped me off, i.e., ""[IMPORT]."""
3,Somewhat predictable,While the plot line was somewhat predictable you may still have a hard time figuring out exactly who did it.
3,"Okay, but kind of bland","This novel just didn't hold my interest as much as the previous novels by this author. The story was interesting, but I kept waiting for it to grab me. It never did. I lost interest abd only kept reading because I wanted to know who was behind it all. Must say I was not surprised. Eventhough I didn't care for this novel as much, I'd still read the next."
1,B A D,"Esoterically lacking in any and all visual departments.It is impossible to become too sesquipeadalian in anylysing this ""movie"""
5,The Lilies of the Field,"I thought that this was a truly wonderful book. It was a down-to-earth book with a down-to-earth character. I loved this book. It was heart warming and inspiring. It again restored my faith in the human race and mankind. If you are feeling kinda low and down, this is just the book to cheer you up."
1,Don't waste your money on this,"The book speaks of being up to date with DOS 3.2, and advanced users with Windows 3.1, hard drives of super size 250 Meg. Gimme a break. Why are they still selling this outdated book? Far from being an introduction to networks, the writer quickly plunges into complex subjects far beyond the scope of an introduction, leaving the reader wondering what is happening. The only thing this book indicates is that the author was employed in the computing field and that the author is neither a writer nor an instructor."
4,good ring and fast shipping,so far so good--ring is as described. much less that local shops. fits well. fast shipping.
5,My wedding band,"Was looking for a band locally, gold is insanely priced, and they actually wanted $150+ for tungsten locally.This ring was $20, has a high polish shine and no visible defects. I've very happy with the product, I know they can't be re-sized, but at this price can easily be replaced."
4,Sample Alert!!!!!,"Attention trainspotters!!...... Armand Van Helden uses a chunk of Carrie's ""Dance With Me"" in his track ""You Don't Know Me"". Just thought you might like to know that morsel of information.Oh yeah, the album is pretty good, but you realy must be a fan of cheesy, brassy, in your face disco/pop from the early eighties, otherwise you may cringe. I didn't cos quite frankly I love this stuff, its just so refreshing and upfront. With the current trend of sampling and recreating old disco riffs you could do far worse than to track down these original jams."
1,don't buy,This book lacks direction. I couldn't bring myself to finish it. I wish Amazon offered a return option on kindle books.
2,Overdone narrative,"Silly and annoying prose. Story itself was pretty good, but the authors style was irritating. So much effort at being clever, not enough focus on telling the story itself."
4,A good first book for our 4th Grade girls book club,"We are a group of girls entering fourth grade. We picked this book to start off our summer book club. Almost everyone liked the book but for some it was a little too sad. We had a lot of discussion from this book about the meaning of a true friend and we were split down the middle about whether Nina was a true friend to Gabi. Overall, it was a well written fictionalized historical book that gives girls a good glimpse of life in the past."
3,A good start,"When all the coins you want cost more than you can afford, tokens offer a welcome escape. However, they are usually not well catalogued. Jean Manasselian has made a brave attempt to fill the gap with a listing of tokens of France and its colonies. Being the first ever to try, he obviously missed quite a few pieces. However, the book is still a great tool, even though another catalog was issued since. An improved, second edition has been promised for years and may never see the light of day. Prices are no longer reliable."
4,better crimper,"As all Channellock tools are, these are very good quality. I like the fact that the crimping area is slightly wider than other crimpers making for, I believe, a stronger crimp."
4,Good Stroller!,"I really like this stroller but, it doesn't steer quite as easily as I would have liked. It was easy to assemble and folds down just as easily. Certainly worth the money but, wish it had a bit more mobility."
3,Great CD but beware!,"This has to be the ultimate compendium of these undeservedly neglected arias. Many of the arias themselves rival the most glorious moments in the operas, and some of them, particularly the high soprano arias, are highly-charged vocal stuntfests that have to be heard to be believed.This set has much to recommend it but does have one major technical flaw. Every copy that I have heard (and that is several) has a skip near the end of Track 10 of Disc 1. It seems to be part of the master and many listeners will be able to live with it, but I do wish that producers would take the time to fix a defect like this for such a significant musical document. Purists beware!"
1,Junk,"I bought channel lock because I wanted a quality American made tool, I would have been better off buying some .99 cent china made junk. The first time I used them a quarter inch of the tip broke off. The sad part is that I was just twisting come aluminum wire, I finished the job with my bare hand."
5,brilliant,"stunning visuals, shocking text, unbelievable parody, deadly music... you can't help but to look at it, really the whole thing - it's like a train wreck - loved it."
4,Atomic Cafe,"Just as good as I remember it to be. Have loaned it to a couple of youngfriends, and they were amazed. It is a whole genre that they knew nothingabout. A little on the long side though."
2,"Tasty, but NOT healthy for kids with 29g of SUGAR","Horizon Vanilla milk is like drinking a Coke from a cow. Just because something is ""organic"" doesn't make it healthy.1 cup of whole milk has 12 grams sugar, while 1 cup of Horizon Vanilla 2% milk has more than twice that- 29 grams of sugar!Plus Horizon Vanilla milk has 180 calories VS 150 for whole and 120 for 2% milk.Two cartons of this stuff is an entire meals worth of calories."
2,Very Short Expiration Date! NO RETURNS!,"Use caution when ordering more than one case at a time (unless you have an army of kids). The expiration dates may be very short. I ordered 5 cases on September 27, 2011. The expiration dates on all cases were November 19, 2011. Since it's a food product, Amazon does not allow returns."
1,BLECH! Honestly cannot stand these now.new formula.,"my parents had been buying these from Costco since I was in 6th grade(just now graduated high school ) they were really delicious and we would go through the crates quickly.About two or 3 years ago, I noticed new packaging and a horrible new taste,it was like they watered it Down.We couldn't even finish the rest of the case and were really disappointed to learn that they changed the formula.we never bought another one.Maybe it is less sugar,but that's what I liked and will not be purchasing again.I also remember them being pretty expensive for cased milk , it was worth It then but not now."
1,Like the old formula better,"My kids have been drinking this milk for years. My older son is essentially a vegetarian, and we have relied on this milk for a big percentage of his daily protein and calcium. He is also a very picky eater, so he noticed immediately the change to low-fat. I know, it has less sugar, but that's a deal-breaker for him. We're willing to let him have that extra sugar, if that's the price we have to pay for him to get his protein. Needless to say, we will be looking for a different brand.BTW, I know I'm not alone. I started buying this milk on Amazon because it would sell out at all the stores in the city I live. Now there's a glut of the new low-fat milk at all the stores."
4,"Color is kinda dull, but ink is well-behaved","This is not the most exciting green. It's a bit lighter than I would like, and it lacks the subtle shading characteristics that I prefer in a fountain pen ink. The color itself is rather flat and uninteresting.Nevertheless, it's a unique shade, tending a VERY little more towards blue than yellow. Personally I would prefer slightly more yellow, but this might be just the right color for someone else.It is a well-behaved ink. It plays nicely with most papers and doesn't bleed through readily. It flows well from both my fine Pilot 78 and my Plumix and washes out of the pen easily."
5,Channellock Plier,"Superb made in America quality. I set out to deliberately buy American, and I'm not sorry. Absolute top quality. I couldn't be happier with my purchase."
1,Dreadful on so many levels,"This would be a better movie if it wasn't based on real people. The writers clearly couldn't be bothered to check up on the basic historical details at all. George III was claimed to be Edward's Father (actually George V) and he [George] died in January 1936. So you can imagine my amazement that somehow Edward managed to celebrate his June birthday in 1936 before his father died. Terrible! If you don't know anything about Edward and Wallis, you might enjoy this movie; if however, you have any idea of the truth of their story, avoid it like the plague - or else it will plague you!"
1,Horrible,"You learn little about the lives or history of Wallis and Edward. A fictional, melodramatic, incredibly dull story is inserted for some odd reason. Looks like the work of a film student using as many techniques as possible, on a huge budget. Wallis is perfectly cast."
2,Not exactly illuminating,"A fairly well made picture but it is certainly revisionist history. I have no doubt that Wallis Simpson saw things this way but, as they say, I think there is more to this story. Her previous marriages had a great impact on this romance, for example, but they are not included. The fact that she fought him on the subject of abdication was glossed over. She certainly never expected to spend the rest of her life in exile but she entered history as a mean spirited gold digger. This movie doesn't change that."
1,Disappointed,"Based on the reviews I read, this seemed to be a potentially clean family show. So I purchased Series One and began watching it last night. How sad that in the first 3 minutes there was swearing and an emphasis on premarital sex. Just a warning for those who still care to not support shows and movies that say these things are okay."
5,Family ordeals.....,"Brothers and Sisters (season 1) just gets you hooked...anyone with a family will relate to alot of the dilemmas this family faces....drama, humor, good acting by all."
4,Cheap but good!,"We bought this in Navy Blue at a local discounter for under $20. I really love the pan! We only have a two item household, so it is just perfect for stews, pastas, meats, etc. The nonstick works great so far, and we make sure to use silicone utensils. Make sure to get nylon headed tongs! The lid fits well, and feels high quality. The pan is however, not very top of the line...it's fairly light, and my boyfriend dropped it a tad while pulling it out of the cabinet (next to the stove) and one side dented. :\We are looking to buy a cookware set, and because of that, will probably avoid this one. The price is very tempting though."
4,European power cord with substandard adapter,"The product is a retractable power cord for a notebook computer. Unfortuntely, although the product is offered on the US website, no mention is made that the plug is a european style plug that is incompatible with North American outlets. To be fair, an adapter was taped to the product packaging that allows the item to be used in the US and Canada, but the adapter is incredibly cheap and doesn't fit the european plug very well. You will want to invest in a more substantial euro two prong to North American two prong adapter (an inexpensive but important purchase).Ironically, for those of us who travel extensively, this product is really useful. I would prefer that this merchant highlight the fact the cord is designed for the European market. If they included a quality adapter, I'd actually pay a premium for this product."
5,Real World Data on Affirmative Action,"Thomas Sowell again delivers a data filled analysis of what really happens, not what people wish would happen with affirmative action. By providing detailed examples over several decades of affirmative action in many countries, he provides insight into what could be the results in the USA. This approach removes some of the inbuilt perceptions about our black/white affirmative action problems here.A must buy for anyone who wants real analysis, not the usual ""diversity"" fluff."
2,"Performance excelent, microphone placement -terrible.","The performance of the planets was flawless. The only thing wrong on this recording is the placement of recording microphones near the french horns. Placement of the microphones must have only been in front of the orchestra. Since these pieces have an important F. horn part, the microphones should have been placed more towards the middle , or even some in the back."
4,A Pretty Good Bargain,"This London two-CD set sells for the price of one CD, so I can just about forgive London for including the Strauss piece. I suppose their rationale was a ""space"" theme, and the opening section of Zarathustra was used to notable effect in Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey--still, did they have to include the whole thing? Aaarrgghhh.The rest of the set is a lot of fun. I bought the LP version of the Holst back in the mid `70s, and it served me well for years. In its CD incarnation, it still sounds pretty good, but is no match either sonically or musically for London's Dutoit recording, Levi's version on Telarc, the Litton on Delos, or the Slatkin on RCA. Time marches on! Still, for the price, and for the bonus of getting the two John Williams suites, both of which are fun to listen to, this set can be seen as a pretty good bargain."
2,"Good price, poor performance","Well I wanted to save some money and these were inexpensive. Unfortunately, they are thin and don't hold up very well in the freezer. Thicker would have been better."
2,Too big.,"The material is super soft and the color is soo cute. It's nice and firm and a very sexy toy BUT it was way too thick for me. I fit it in me once but I could hardly move it and I felt like I was gonna rip somethin lol :( Won't be using this toy too often, unfortunately..."
4,good,"This is quality hiphop. Buck 65s first release that doesn't have massive amounts of filler,i recommend this."
5,"Sweet Cutters, Channllock Quality","As with most all the Channellock products that I own, the quality in these is evident from the minute you put them in your hand. They have heft and feel very solid and strong in the hand. The finish is very good, the grips are excellent and non-slip and the cutting action itself is excellent.Cutters are one area that you don't want to cheap out because the cheap brands will never last and are not made to the quality level that you get with brands like Channellock. If you want something that will wear like iron and last a long time, not to mention being well made and backed by a solid warranty (and a domestic, US manufacturer), I cannot recommend these enough.An excellent purchase that I would make again in a heartbeat. Channellock tools are an excellent choice with quality that you can depend on and that competitors, especially off-shore cheapies, cannot hope to touch."
3,"Interesting, not neccesary","An interesting (but not neccesary) record that basically let us know how the russians listens and process their music, transforming the mode's songs into their own vision. The result is great with songs like ""Somebody"", ""the things you said"" and ""Sister of night"", wich reminds the sound of Ultravox or Japan mixed with the classic depeche sign. The ""Black Celebration"" version is also of interest (can you imagine what could happened if Bob Marley discovered this song?) Also try to spell the russian translations of ""Enjoy the Silence"" and ""behind the wheel"""
2,Pretty bad...,"That last review from the American Corner Gas fan must either be a joke, or perhaps the reviewer could have had a few too many drinks before he wrote his review :) The truth is that ""Corner Gas"" is very dull to watch and not even remotely funny or entertaining in any way. The acting, writing, and production are so cheap and amateurish, its like watching a home movie somebody made with their video camera. And the jokes? They don't make me laugh, I just roll my eyes whenever I hear the hundredth joke about how small Dog River is, or how flat and empty the praries are. I would just like to tell Brent Butt, and every other person employed by this show that you guys are d@mn lucky that the federal government imposed those strict ""Thirty Percent Canadian Content"" regulations on Canadian radio and television broadcasters back in the '70s. Otherwise you guys would have no career in television, and this programme would have gone nowhere."
2,Unhelpful and Biased,"I bought this book but ended up returning it. I found Johnsen's description of Hinduism's influence on Greek and Roman culture to be overenthusiastic, under-referenced and a generally distorted picture. She was far too quick to dismiss the attitudes and science of ""the West"" in favour of an uncritical acceptance of the ""traditional wisdom"" of India.I should also mention that my girlfriend, who grew up in India, was not very impressed with this book, particularly the sweeping statements about ""all Hindus"" and ""all Westerners"".Apologetics have a place, but some of the theories presented here as ""plausible"" are partisan and highly questionable. This is totally counterproductive in an elementary survey.I went with the second edition of Diana Eck'sDarsan(ISBN: 0-89012-042-0), and I am much more satisfied."
5,Good Book,This books is well written and provide good information. The writter goes straight to the point. I recommend to read this book for introduction to the hindu culture.
2,Deception,"Lack of intensity, superficial, compared to other of SA.SWANN I am disapointed.You do not get ""involved"", you turn pages but without real fun...."
5,The best reference for non-network Outlook 2000 users,"This is a superb reference for those who use Outlook 2000 on a non-network platform; most of the books out now focus on using Outlook 2000 as a client for Microsoft Exchange. This book, however, concentrates on exploring the functionality of the program as a stand-alone and internet-enhanced app. If you already use Outlook, you'll learn some great new tricks. If you're new to the program, this is a great place to start. The book also includes information for those who *do* use it as an Exchange client, so it should fit the bill for any but network administrators."
5,Brilliant,"In short, I loved it. One of the best American sitcoms, funny, engaging, clever script, fine direction and a brilliant cast.You wouldn't guess it was first aired in the eighties, but for missing cell phones and laptops.Amazon delivered reliably, down under, as always.Re-mastering is excellent, great colours and clear sound - in PAL.I hope the rest of the seasons will follow soon. Highly recommended!"
5,Preordered-ready for Season 4...the Roz Rozline years...,"I can't believe this complete series is not on DVD yet. It was on 9 seasons, was top 10 in the ratings, and was nominated and won several Emmy awards.Some series that have 1, 2 or 3 seasons have been on DVD for years!Still glad they are starting to roll them out. Season 4 and on are my favorite with Roz Rozline joining the cast-she is great!Keep em coming!"
3,Night Court - Season 3,"Hi, pretty much the quality of humour and the show overall is continued from Seasons 1 and 2 ( which I've bought and seen ). No doubt this is no small feat as trying to have original stories gets harder and harder. Certainly buy it ! Regards."
5,Dirty Hijinks at Its Best,"I was so, so, so, very glad Night Court was put out on DVD. I have all three and you know I'll be watching for the rest of the set. I loved it when it was on NBC (no matter how many times they switched the timeslot) and the reruns on WGN. They used to come on TVLand, but I think they pulled them once they were out on DVD. But anyway, I love Night Court especially John Larroquette. He made the show. At first I watched for Harry Anderson, but only a great emsemble cast can pull you through."
2,Carmina Burana CD,This CD is poorly recorded and the volume has to be turned way up to even hear the music. I am very disappointed in this purchase and would not recommend this particular recording.
1,Does Bimingham Know What Country he is Writing About?,"After reading ""A Concise History of Portugal"" I have to wonder why such poor material is allowed to be published. This book is so full of distortions, primarily regarding the sociology of the Portuguese within Portugal and the colonial empire, that it borders on fiction. Birmingham's research was acomplished through very faulty secondary sources, and it clearly shows. I have a substantial knowledge of Iberian (and Portuguese) history, and can safely say that certain sections of Birmingham's book (particulary with respect to social groups and ethnicity) are crude opinions presented as fact. This person is a respected historian? Maybe he is writing about the planet Pluto, not Portugal? That's it, he misspelled Pluto, slight mistake., My, My, standards certainly have deteriorated."
1,As Bad As They Come!,"I can appreciate a campy. low tech sci-fi ""B"" flick as much as the next guy, but this movie is about as bad as they come. I watched about twenty minutes of this movie, then I actually threw away the disc along with the artwork, saving the case as a replacement! Yep, I threw it in the trash! Absolutely no redeeming value here, no matter how you look at it.My rating would be zero stars if that was an option."
4,Good Rainy Day Fun,"These are the kind of movies I really enjoy.Sure,the special effects are cheesey,but that's what makes them FUN.There's no pretense about being intellectual here.Frankly,movies like these are BETTER than the blockbusters with state of the art special effects & billion dollar budgets.These are movies to enjoy on a rainy day or weekend.Even the kids can watch these."
5,good replacement filters,These work really well. This is my second order of these filters (six sets of these two packs). I've gone through three (individual) filters in five months. The left side of the Braun Allure QC2 re-circ vent is where the fan is so it needs to be replace twice as often as the right side. These charcoal snap in filter do the trick. These filters really absorb a lot of the vaporized oil and odors - I'd say even better than most re-circ vents. All filters fit the QC2 and all have the white change strip indicator.
5,Product Fits Broan ALLURE range hood,Product looks as described in listing and fits perfectly. Please note that these filters attach to your supplied mesh screen. These charcoal filters come with spring clips that easily attach to original grease filters and install in just a few minutes.My hood lists charcoal filter part# 99010308 inside the hood. These filters fit perfectly.
3,Disposable Game,"This game was highly anticipated by my 3 year old, but disappointing. The game is way too short, and misses out on all the fun that was in the movie."
3,Table of Contents,"I've been reading stories from this book for an English class of mine. I was delighted to find a free e-book version, but horrified to discover no table of contents, so I took the time to go through and pin down locations at about where the stories begin.1) No News. - Page 22) The Tenth of January - Page 293) Night-Watches - Page 604) The Day of My Death - Page 755) ""Little Tommy Tucker"" - Page 1056) One of the Elect - Page 1147) What Was the Matter? - Page 1338) In the Gray Goth - Page 1549) Calico - Page 17310) Kentucky's Ghost - Page 200Keep in mind, these are estimates based on the size of the fonts I use on my Kindle. Your page number will be the same, but if you use a smaller or larger font, you may find that you have to click forward or backward a few ""pages."" Hope this helped!"
4,gift to a redskin fan,"I bought the blanket for my friend as a christmas gift. it was a big hit with all the redskin fans.delivery was very iffy, but i did get it in time for christmas. i was ordered 4 weeks before christmas so if i need to order again i may have to order before thanksgiving to keep the stress down."
5,Stylish without the bling,"I don't love super shiny, bling on cabinets. I prefer the muted antique look, so these were perfect. The detail at the top and bottom keeps these femInine enough, but the muted look is masculine, too. Great buy and they arrived within a week!"
1,Roof and Gutter patch tape,"This product is a waste of money. I used it on a section where two gutters meet, which drips water all the time.. After putting on the tape, more then one piece, it still leaked right through...don't recommend this product at all."
4,The best recording of I Lombardi,"This is the best recording of this opera. Although aged Pavarotti still pulls his weight. Anderson is simply awesome. I wish there were more recordings with her. This is the only recording of this opera worth buying. Some of the moments in the opera are great, there are some boring spots, but it's verdi you've got to have it anyway. Anderson and Pavarotti's duet is my favorite moment."
5,Benny and Joon!,"Here I got a 2 for one deal. My favorite!! I liked man in the moon, it is a good drama. You need a box of kleenex though. i found it to be a tear jerker at some point. Now Benny and Joon. I don't know how anyone can not fall in love with Johnny Depp. Yes, he was great in Pirate's of the Caribbean. He plays a slightly different character in this film, he is a bit autistic one might say? He plays his character to the fullest. He is charming, witty, just so adorable. It's a classic but it will never be too old for any genre. This movie is like a breath of fresh air! Don't take my word for it, do a search for Benny and Joon movie trailer, watch the preview and then you just might see where I'm coming from. (my fav. part is him doing hat tricks)"
5,A good pair of pliers,"This is a great pair of pliers to have, I have trusted Channellock for a very long time, simply because they make great pliers, I only buy Channellock and Craftsman pliers, simply because they can stand up to any working conditions. I have used this comfortable pair of pliers for a lot of things, not just wiring, it helped me with my car a whole lot as well. A very good and useful tool to have, doesn't slip and feels like it belongs in your hand..."
3,Roberto Carlos in Portuguese,"I order this item but I never got the right one I returned the wrong item and Amazon send me for a second time the a wrong cd. May be amazon doesn't have the item 30 grandes sucesses by Roberto Carlos in Portuguese?Please let me know because this is the third time I am wringting about this.Thanks, Margarita Lozano"
1,Klass Mango Drink,"It doesn't taste anything like Mango at all, there is some kind of an after taste that I can't tell what it is. I will never buy this product again and never will recommend to anyone."
3,"seems OK OK, not best, not bad","I bought this TV in philips outlet for 750$. Used it for less than month now. But beware of long waits on philips customer service.Pros----1. Cheap, inexpensive, TV for bedrooms or kitchen.2. Picture quality seemed ok with HD , so far.3. Look and Feel of the TV is good.Cons----1. Only one HD-Analog connection (Component to VGA)* Beware of this, though the TV has component input, its not HD Capable unlike all other TVs. Philips gave a special Component to VGA cord, which can be used for regular dvd player progressive scan(480p).2. Only one HD-Digital connection (HDMI)3. Though the TV says 16:9, I can only see 15:9 in wide screen format.4. Black levels are not as dark, it may be scenario with all LCD TVs. Plasmas has dark black levels.5. Poor and long waiting on customer service. I think philips should consider outsourcing customer service, instead of torturing customers with long waits.6. Very badly packaged, so open the package cautiously."
5,This CD is HOT! Nichelle's vocal styling is exceptional.,"I'm taken by this CD and the tune ""The Man""...(shades of Tyrone) Wow! The smooth beat and the lyrics. You go girl! A new artist on the horizon. Since hearing Nichelle's Millenaire CD, I go through my day humming the tunes. Given some time (and air play) this artist will blow up big. Note the following guitar work by James White, III. The Chameleon man's rhythms are awesome. Keep in mind, a couple of these tunes I believe will go double plat..."
1,No meat in this article,"I bought this article hoping for some ideas for performing circuit training with my children. I was very disappointed in the 12 activities listed (double spaced) in this 2 page article. The 12 activites were: Lines on the floor, Ropes on the floor, Carpet Squares, Stunts and tumbling, Tunnel hoop and box mazes, Climbing apparatus, Bean Bags, Balloons, Nerf balls, Jogging, Scotter boards, and Aerobics. That about sums it up. Don't waste your money."
3,Average Study Guide,I would recommend using this book in conjunction with Microsoft 70-431 preparation guide and Measure UP's or Self Test Software's preperation and practice tests. Its hard to pass SQL 2005 depending only on this book (unless you have some experience working with SQL 2005). Good for quick final review before exam too.
4,Buy it only if you have free shipping.,"Not bad if you have free shipping as far as price and all. Haven't used it in a while...I guess you use it when you start to learn, but the after you make several dozen cappuccino's, you learn to do without it..."
4,Great for the price,This thermometer works really well. My only complaint is it's a bit long for our frothing pitchers.
2,Mike is right ... the product has changed.,"Amazon's photo is misleading: the actual dial is NOT the dial on the product page, and the photo shows some sort of guide on the sheath, which is not on the actual one. Also although the ""clip"" on the sheath is of questionable use, the picture shows a metal one, which should be pretty sturdy. The product however has a one-piece black sheath with a molded clip which gives it a cheap and ugly look. If I had seen accurate pictures of this, I would not have purchased it.GOOD points: it is accurate, and that's why it's good. Also the sheath does have a hex-shaped top that saves you from picking up a pair of pliers to calibrate the boiling point. Of course you do that once, maybe twice ever, so there's little real added value."
4,Great fellow Up,"I find Second Nature to be a better CD from Kathrine then her frist.Songs on this one are better and show off her voice more then her first Cd.My fave song's on this Cd are Time To Say Goodbye,House of No Regrets,En Aranjuez con tu amor,Song to the Moon,Calon Lan,Hymn to the Fallen, O Holy Night,You'll Never Walk Alone."
5,Good Summer Read,"Nancy and I are Lake House neighbors. I knew she was writing a book and I was thrilled to buy it when it was published. When you know someone but not all that well you don't know what to expect of their writing talents. I was pleasently surprised at how good it was. I'm a big reader, especially mysteries and I've got to say she is right up there with all of the other top mystery authors. I know she is working on a second book. I can see her sitting on her patio writing, and I wonder what she is writng about. What is the plot on this next book going to be? I can't wait to read it!"
1,What book did you guys read?,"I'm not sure what book everyone else read, but the book I read was disassociated, confusing, angry, and hard core leftist.It took me getting half way through the book to understand what the hell he was talking about. And his argument? Bush sucks. Done.Unlike many of the reviewers, I don't think this work was powerful. I don't think it was interesting. I agree with some of his positions, but even I had hard time trying to find what they were.I thought Maus and (to a lesser extent) Maus II were brillant books, and bought this book sight unseen simply because of those books. But I think that the good press of Maus has gone to the author's head and he tried to sound like way too many NYCers do: Smarter than everyone because they're from NYC (I lived there for a year, FYI).Would I recommend this book? Not even as a loaner from a friend."
2,Definitely Not Maus,"This is definitely not ""Maus"". If I didn't already know it was the same author, I would find it hard to believe. He even states that he is not a political cartoonist -- probably should have stopped on the first page. :("
3,Product different from Image Shown,"When I ordered, I was expecting 6 sets (one per season, like in the image) but instead it arrived in a single box, with cheap dvd holders. Almost seems pirated. I have bought many tv season box sets from amazon and this has never happened before. This one is going back. I'll upload the image of the set I received."
5,Perfect,"As others have said, these bookends are very attractive and very serviceable. They have a nice heft to them, obviously an important quality in a bookend. I've purchased perhaps half-a-dozen bookends -- obviously I own a lot of books -- and if I could trade them all for these, I would do that. These are the best bookends I own by a long shot."
4,Durable and does the job.,"Fulfilled all expectations. The product is pretty self explanitory. Durable and if I had to, would buy again or recommend to someone looking for similar item. We use it mainly to make eggs-in-a-basket for breakfast."
3,racket without a cover,It is a fine racket but it is the first time I have been sold a racket without a cover ( for protection )
4,Good quality overall,"I'd also ordered the 6"" version and both share similar qualities. The 12"" was a bit rougher overall but not to objectionable. The handle part was roughly cast and it arrived with a few dings that made bare hand use a bit rough. Having worked in a machine shop, modifying tools isn't uncommon. The rough casting was deburred/rounded and the handles are much more comfortable."
3,This Solti Ring is over-rated...,"Solti's conducting is the primary problem with this Ring, and the reason I do not enjoy much of it. Solti is a shallow musical thinker, and he presses far too much, to the point of annoyance. Everything is unnecessarily tense and forced when he conducts, and the Vienna Philharmonic would have played much better with no conductor than with him. Solti's only accomplishment with this Ring is that he inflicted his nervous musically insipid personality onto the world's greatest orchestra, and this orchestra fought off the gad-fly Solti as best it could. Solti has more Grammys than any other conductor. What should that tell you about his ability? I rest my case. Any truly knowledgable and sensitive listener knows that Solti is 99% of the time a musical joke."
1,all or nothing,"Personally I hated it. The Ring is such an astounding piece that it either works or it doesn't - and this, for me, doesn't. I felt completely alienated from what was going on - where's the PASSION. This Ring seems to have a heart of stone and left me cold. And I felt the much hyped 'theatricalty' of the sound made it seem very contrived. Wagner should FLOW not be broken into bits like Solti does. Where's the long line and the sense of structure. Sorry folks but No Way - this just doesn't make the grade. If you want to hear how Wagner should sound then get Bohm's 60's recording of Tristan und Isolde."
3,Overblown,"This set had a great impact in the early 60's, but 40 years later, it certainly shows its age. The problem is the abusive editing of Culshaw, these recordings hardly feel as straight performances, but rather as highlights. Solti too is a brash, not very interesting conductor, what a pity that Knappterbusch, Szell or Reiner were not prefered. Of course there are great individual performances by many singers here, but it is very interesting to note that Birgit Nilsson never liked this cycle. I much prefer the live Bohm on Philips, or the recent Sawallisch on EMI."
4,"If you like Wagnerian volume, buy Solti.","I must agree with the other reviewers about the recording engineer and his gimmicks with the score. Having heard Birgit Nilsson live, I am happy to have her recorded in this Solti rendition. My preference, however, is for Karajan. Karajan's Walkure is by far a better production. Gundula Janowitz is magnificent as Sieglinde; no one else even comes close. I own both the Solti and the Karajan recordings, and I find myself listening more often to the Karajan set. When I'm in the mood for volume and special effects, I put on Solti. When it's lyricism and romanticism I'm after, Karajan hits the spot."
3,Eh... just okay,"I bought two of these, and ended up using them only twice. They don't seem to keep my daughters bottles cold for very long."
2,overmike,"The balance between singers and orchestra is not true. In an operatic stage, the singers should be almost drown out by the gigantic orchestra. That makes it so much more exciting.Other than that, the singers are great.But I think the conducting is overkill, and the sound not natural sounding."
2,Misplaced hype,"This band is noteworthy, but only because they are so undeserving of the hype surrounding them that they work mostly as a puzzle. Can the kids today know so little about music that they're genuinely excited by this band? Against Me! has good energy, are angry at the right things, and this album is even full of sing-along toe-tappers, but one can find all of that in thousands of other punk albums. The vocals here are mediocre, even for a punk band, and for a CD featuring a guy brandishing a Rickenbacker on the cover, there's not one bit of guitar work that isn't punk-by-the-numbers. Maybe the band just wanted to borrow some of Rickenbacker's style since Against Me! isn't getting it done with their own music.The sincerity of the anarchism-flavored lyrics comes through, and I salute the kids who love the band because of that. However, the album's only worth downloading. There are thousands of better albums to spend your cash on."
2,"Cheap Price, Cheap Quality","I bought this hammock in Feb' 05 during a sale at amazon. (~$52) Overall I thought the hammock was ok at first, though it stretched a great deal. I bought the stand that goes with it, and even on the highest chain link, it sits very low once you get in. I'm not a huge guy, but I DEFINATELY would not put two people in it. Now it is 10 months down the road, and the hammock frayed and snapped. I used it frequently in the beginning, but only a handful of times the last 5 monthes. The only good thing about it hanging low, was that my fall was only a foot, instead of a few feet. Any idea if there is a warranty?"
1,Too weak.,"I am not happy with this hammock for the following reasons.1) The rope used for this hammock is too thin; it cuts into the skin and I seriously doubt that it will hold two people safely. This will also be a problem when it has been in the sun for some time (which has to be expected for a hammock), UV rays makes cotton brittle.2) The ropes are knotted, and not twisted like my previous hammocks, which causes it to cut into the flesh even more (and I weigh less than 120 lbs).3) I have a standard free-standing hammock stand, and the hammock stretched all the way to the floor when I first used it (again, because the rope is too thin).If the hammock hadn't been relatively cheap I would have sent it back; I just resented paying again $20 shipping plus having the hassle of packaging/ waiting at the Post office etc.The only thing I liked was the with of the hammock.This was one experience I will write off as ""you get what you pay for""."
3,Very mixed,"The Christmas Oratorio is splendid, though the solo work is not the best, the choral work is excellent, and I could kiss the feet of the trumpet player.The Mass in B minor is not very well done, and the St. John Passion is very unsatisfactory, sloppy and half-hearted, Hamari seems almost exasperated on her first solo, and I can't say I blame her.I didn't try the St. Matthew Passion, it was the same set of chorus and orchestra and soloists for the most part, as the St. John Passion.I do not understand how there could be so much variation in quality in the same set, with the same conductor."
4,Fascinating and Funny,"""Talk To Me"" is a fast moving biograpical film about the broadcasting career of comedian Petey Green. I'd never heard of Green until I saw this film, but I was fascinated by the way he took over the Washington D.C. airwaves on the night that Martin Luther King was killed. While that historic night is only a short portion of the film, it showed Green's intelligence and influence. This film is worth seeing by anyone who is studying this time period in American History.Don Cheadle is hilarious and most of this film will keep you laughing out loud."
1,Too flimsy,"Like the other reviewers have said, this server is too flimsy for even the lightest cake. Practically useless--I'm glad I didn't pay for it."
2,It was cheap.....,Why is it so flimsy. I am trying to figure out if this physically flexible server has a purpose. Heck it was .89 cents. I needed a filler to get free shipping.
2,it didn't work,it didn't work for me so I was holding to it to see if I can use sometimes but until now it's just sitting in my store room.
1,Do NOT bother,"I thought i had a winner. until it came that is. there was a GAP in the thing you put in the comp! seems it was for PCIXpress and NOT pci. dual too, not my crummy compwannabe (emachine, 2,60ghz, 80GBHD, 512MBmemory, DVD+/-RW!)... so i did everything as was told. software, card, sawp wires, start, and voila. or maybe that should be: v....o..i..l...a...! .seems that twice the power means half the speed on regular comps. oh well, at least i got it back to the AMAZON. no hard feelings, i hope.dca aka moose123"
3,"Item shipped, not item shown.","I cannot review this item. I have to return it.Images do not show the item received. The images show (multiple, different cards) with a PCI interface with notches indicating that it is compatible with both 5 volt and 3.3 volt PCI systems. The item received was not the item shown in any of the images. It had a PCI interface with a single notch indicating 5 volt system only. The description does not provide enough specification to distinguish."
5,Bravo Mr. Handel,"A Great Master's Mastery, Masterly Mastered by a Master!!Translation?? In any speak, this is classic Handel, played at it's best, by the one who should know!!!Hogwood's genius as a foremost expert on my personal favourite composer, can never be overestimated, and here, presented in a medium of works we all know and can relate to, are a showcase of his awesome skills and brand of 'Mastery'!!One feels obliged to pay homage to composer and conductor alike, for without either, we could not see the creation of this CD, in what is a pinnacle of art and high standard in performance.Accordingly, Bravo Mr. Handel, and many many congratulations to Mr Hogwood and all the performers."
1,Forget it,There are no pads on the bottom of this board so it's slides on my granite counters. I bought stick-on pads but they came off the board.The black is really nice but gets scratched quickly and then looks awful. The board is too big to go in the dishwasher which means some food smells can linger.Amazon purchases are generally hits for me...this one was a definitive bust
4,Great for your HDPE projects,"I needed a chunk of black HDPE board for a motorcycle-related project and discovered (surprisingly) that HDPE cutting boards are much cheaper than the equivalent-sized HDPE board purchased directly from industrial sources. I searched and found this same cutting board offered from a couple of big department stores; however, buying off Amazon was cheaper (Amazon Prime, baby!) and it arrived barely 24 hours after ordering."
4,The Odyssey revisted,I enjoyed reading this translation of Homer's Odyssey very much. Many years ago in school we studied an earlier translation which was more in line with Elizabethan English. Richmond Lattimore's translation is in more current English and much easier to understand and enjoy.
3,lusterless,The only qualm I have with this set is that the String Quartet No. 9 is a lusterless endeavor when compared to other renditions. The intensity and suffering just isnt there.
5,"LOVE,LOVE,LOVE THIS PRODUCT","I'M SO GLAD I FOUND THIS PRODUCT ON AMAZON, IT KEEPS MY SKIN FROM BEING ITCHY DURING THE WINTER, AND MY FACE IS NOT PEELING FROM THE DRY WINTER AIR."
2,The scientist too strong,"We buy the bar soap from his manufacturer and was excited to see the liquid. I thought it was scent free like te soap, but it isn't. Te scent is too strong, I ended up giving it away."
2,Negative surprise after opening CD,"I was inspired to purchase Cantata 78 (included in this product) from an exceptional performance on a Public Radio station. Because I was driving I could not copy the recording information. From the information provided by Amazon, I could not tell prior to purchase that the selections were performed on original instruments which I do not prefer, and that a countertenor was substituted for the contralto. The noticeable difference in voice quality is unacceptable. The performance is generally thin and the choir appeared to be reduced in size. I will buy no more products from Amazon unless I have heard the specific recording. But I have spent $17 and am unable to return the product which I will now seldom listen to."
5,Renee Fleming can do it all,Renee Fleming shows us on this CD just how versatile she is. She sing songs that she has made her signatures to perfection adding nuances that only she can perform. Fleming is an asset to the opera world
4,what a voice....,"I love this recital which is my first introduction to a solo album by Fleming.Her voice , with its richness and dusky timbre and beautiful, strong higher notes is a treat to hear.She did sound expressive too but has not yet touched a chord in me when it comes to emotion and feeling.Call me a helpless Callas fan, but I couldn't help but wonder how La Divina would sound if she sang Russian and played Tatyana in the ""Letter"" scene; what a great vehicle for acting!But it does take voices a while to grow on me and that might be it.I do plan on buying more of her CDs."
3,Good value,Not what I had hoped - but you get what you pay for. This scope does not have the independent tubes to each ear.
5,Saint Saens Organ Symphony with Cavaille-Coll organ,"This is the famous Saint Saens Organ Symphony featuring the fabulous Cavaille-Coll organ at St. Ouen in Rouen, France. The organ is extremely powerful and the reverberation time is between 6 and 10 seconds. If you like a recording with a polite organ, often eclipsed by the orchestra, you will hate this recording. If however, you desire a exceptional recording with a dramatic and powerful organ, this performance is sensational.The Abbey Church of St. Ouen contains a large four-manual pipe organ built in 1890 by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll. This instrument is considered to be one of the most important organs in France, and is notable for its unusually powerful 32' Contre Bombarde. The organ stands unaltered and thus is one of the few of the master's works to speak with its original voice.Powerful french organs are nothing like the American Classic organ. With this performance you will have an extraordinary and thrilling experience."
3,Didn't Last,"This is a cute toy and my grandson enjoyed it. However, it did not last as long as it should have for the price I paid."
4,Fabulous Performances,"These are beautifully played. The only problem is the sound is not up to truly Audiophile standards. If you love the music, then this could be the one but be warned that sound quality isn't up to the latest in sound."
3,"OK, but not ""perfect""","The book does contain tons of words by topic. Unfortunately, the font in which they are set is just AWFUL! I got a headache in the first 20 pages. Also, the author has included LOTS of her own poems and sayings rather than doing more serious research. I am still looking for a book with ""perfect"" words."
4,Cool little book,"I really enjoyed this book because it is one of the few that I have have found that combines quotes and poetry, which is very unique. It is well-organized, and it is easy to find what you are looking for. I loved how the book was put together, though the font was a bit distracting, and I think you would probably enjoy it too.Have Fun!Todd HagopianPresident/CEOHagopian InstituteAuthor of the popular ""Quote Junkie"" book sereies and the brand new ""Idiom Junkie"" series"
4,Fantastic Book,THis book has been instrumental in sparking creativity when journaling in scrapbooks and for card making. I would recommend this book for all who create scrapbooks and those who make their own cards.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS!,"I purchased this scale a few weeks before Christmas and the scale broke about week after its arrival(I know I weigh way under its limit). Upon closer examination, to find what might be wrong. I notice this red tag stating ""DO NOT RETURN TO RETAILER"" with HoMedic customer service contact information. So, I said to myself hey why not try to contact them to see if they could assist me. I called first figuring that may be the quickest way to get some feedback, well they didn't pick up but I did leave a callback number on their machine. They never called back. So, I decided maybe an email might do the trick. Was I wrong? Yes, they never replied to it. The scale itself is just a plain simple model scale, which attracts dust like nothing else in my house. I give this product a HUGE FAIL rating and probably won't buy anymore HoMedic products ever again."
4,Temp for Concerto for Two Trupmets much too slow,This is a great collection of Vivaldi Music - However I was quite disappointed with the Slow Tempo interpretation of the Concerto for Two Trumpets - I have heard many versions over the years and they are all interpreted at a faster more cheerful Tempo. I particularly recommend the one conducted by Neville Marriner which is available in Amazon (another very good version performed by a French Orchestra is not avialable in CD)
1,get over it... it sucks!!!,"i think even one star is a way too generous rating for this movie. kirsten dunst is my favourite actress, but even she could not save this dire film.the acting was awful and so was the storyline. if you must see it, rent it."
3,Disappointing to a Bach-lover,"While this set has some good ideas (playing on era-original instruments) the recordings are flawed by two significant problems. 1. There are numerous problems with the horns, from sloppy, inarticulate tongue technique to positively poor intonation which is the most distracting element. 2. The rest of the orchestra (and conductor), while technically ok, lack the vitallity which is the hallmark of Bach's work. I found the almost-timid arrangements to be boring. I will not be keeping this album."
2,Home Winemaking Step-by-Step,"The book contains some interesting winemaking tips. Unfortunately, the quality of said information gets lost in the twisted tangle of grammatically challenged pages. Two stars for the information and zero stars for the presentation."
4,Comic genius,"If you are a fan of the Flash Gordon comics...and why else would you be looking at this page...this is a fine purchase. It's comic art at it's most simple and evocative. You don't find story lines like these (teetering between profound and silly) any more. Plus, as an artist, the perfect line work and imaginative compositions are something to view in slack-jawed awe."
2,Yuck,"I purchased this book partly based on the great reviews, but also partly on the dream that you could make great cakes in a snap. Maybe I am a purist, but cake mix still tastes like cake mix, no matter how you ""doctor"" it.I tried several recipes, and they all still tasted like cake mix. I even served some to a friend, and she asked me if it was cake mix. If you are really looking for good cake, don't expect it here. Take the time to make it from scratch -- it is worth the effort!"
5,Yummy results!!!!,"The recipes in this book are sooooooooooo very good and easy to follow. I bought the book a while back and have made several cakes and bars from it. They all turned out so wonderful!!!! First of all if you buy this book, make sure to read the introduction of the book. This is very helpful, because then you know what all to have on hand to make the recipes in this book. So plan ahead a little before going all out. Also, yes, these are desserts that are very high in fat ect....or ""not healthy."" If you are on a diet why would you buy this book? You can splurge a little every once in a while, that's why. Why deprive yourself from such bliss and yummy cakes, cookies, bars, and desserts? Treat yourself to this book of recipes. It's worth the extra calories!!!"
4,cake Doctor,"plenty of recipes to choose from....all look delicious. Most recipes recommend cake mix that does not have ""pudding in the mix"" or ""moist"", I have had a difficult time finding that."
3,still not up to scratch,"It is good for what it is, it does upgrade the box mixes, but they still don't compete w/ a scratch cake. We use it mostly if my kids want to do a cake & we don't have the time for me to babysit for the whole time for them to do a scratch cake. They will pull out one of these, do it up, then all I have to watch is to make sure they don't burn themselves getting it in the oven. (10 & 12 years old)"
5,The Cake Doctor,"The cake doctor is a great book. I am used to making homemade cakes and found that I didn't have the time any more. I really missed making desserts and cakes and when my boss recommended the Cake Doctor I jumped on it. Every cake turns out great and really does taste homemade, your imaginzation is limitless and the recipes are fabulous. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to bake and especially to kids who love to cook."
4,The Cake Doctor,I've had this book for several years and really enjoy it. My great niece lives with my nephew and she likes to bake.I felt it would be sosmething easy that dad would not stress over helping her with the instructions... fairly simple to follow
5,A Fun Cookbook with Great Results,Cakes are my weakness and this book is great for turning those good ol' mixes into some tantilizing treats. The fruit fillings are special and the bundt cakes have our potluck friends asking for more. As with any cookbook not every recipe hits a homerun with me but I am sure they will in someone elses kitchen. There are definitely enough great ideas in here to justify its cost. We gave some for Christmas gifts. Thanks to the author for a worthwhile addition to our cooking library!!
1,It's a Pity,"I understand why a book of this type would appeal to some people, but I find it sad.It is so easy to make a cake the REAL way (you know... flour, sugar, butter, eggs, milk, cocoa, etc....) that I find it sad that anyone who wants to use her/his creativity in the kitchen would bother to start with a MIX!Even the best mixes taste like chemicals, if you taste thoughtfully.Why not try a recipe instead of a BOX??"
5,The Cake Mix Doctor,This cookbook has become a staple in my collection of cookbooks. So many people haved raved about the cakes I serve - everyone is amazed the cakes begin with a mix!
5,FANTASTIC GIFT! FANTASTIC RECIPES!,"This was bought as a gift for a VERY, VERY good cook and she LOVES it! This book makes it easy to create using a cake mix...and take unique, tasty desserts to any number of events and happenings and makes you look like a chef! BUY IT!"
4,Creative,Great book for making cake mixes better. I would recommend this for anyone that doesn't want just a plain cake. Fun book
5,book,I have had this book for years and purchased an additional book as a gift for a friend. It's one of the best.
5,Wonderful book!,"This book is just wonderful. It's so full of great recipes for quick and delicious deserts. I've tried some suggested here and have loved all of them. It would probably take me years to make all in the book. This is very highly recommend for any baker whether you are a novice or expert. For the price I think it's a cook book every home cook needs. I'm a good cook, but have never been a cook baker until this book."
2,"So far, not impressed","I just made the sherry-poppy seed cake for dinner, and, admittedly, it was incredibly easy and fast. But I found it horribly sweet and fake-tasting. I am impressed by all these other raves, so I will try at least one other cake before giving up and going back to my old, labor-intensive from-scratch favorites. One thing is sure -- this is a fun cookbook read, and for certain purposes (like toddler birthdays) it's probably worth saving some time and skipping the Cake Bible."
5,Beautiful colors,I bought the quilt years ago and somehow lost my color directions so I was never able to finish it. I was so excited when I found this on amazon the exact same thing that now I can finish both and have it out year round
5,This book is a LIBRARY!,"Originally, I read this book that I borrowed from a friend. It is so necessary as a reference that I purchased my own copy. You can't remember it all--you need to go reread parts at times."
2,Too long!,"There are some good concepts in this book, but it could have been said in one-third the space. The authors rehash the material too much and literally run it into the ground. I would not buy it again, even though it was recommended by AARP."
4,Clever computer-aged twist on the murder mystery,"This is a really clever book. Basically a murder mystery, the plot impressed me by all the directions it eventually took. Just when I thought I had my finger on the story, it went in another direction. The author obviously is well-read on many arcane subjects, as evidenced by the detail he provides on topics ranging from Catholicism, Philosophy, History, Sherlock Holmes, Architecture, Logic and Computer Programming, not to mention the culture and sights of Seattle. Whew. Yeah, there's your typical romance, sex and blood going on as well, but after all, it IS a murder mystery. The characters are all quirky and well defined. If you like mysteries, strange situations, adventure and character-interaction, it's safe to say you would enjoy this book."
5,One of my son's favorites,My son got introduced to Stuart Little Learning Adventure at Preschool and it was the only thing he asked for for his 4th birthday. He enjoys parts of it so much that he is recreating the games around the house with his own toys.
2,mediocre,"Boring, confusing and has a trick ending. I love little British mysteries but this one disappointed. The characters were dull, prattling about nothing and I just did not care about the 'mystery'. If the village had been hit by a bomb, I would have been a bit grateful."
1,Liberating Your Magnificence,"This book is the worst kind of simplistic new-age junk. The other books I've read by Scott Peck were wonderful, but this one is a real dud."
3,Only One Good Song,"I heard ""White Boy, Brown Girl"" on Pandora and loved it! Much to my surprise, neither iTunes or Amazon had the mp3 available for download, so I had to order/ import the album via Amazon. ""White Boy, Brown Girl"" is still an awesome song, but the rest of the album ( which is only 4 tracks ) ranges from ""meh"" to ""ugh""."
4,Does what its supposed to do,"Good stuff. Works as advertised. Isn't that all that need be said? But for those considering freezing with one of those drug store freezing methods, forget about it. They don't work as advertised. For the few freezing works on, it still takes up to two weeks for the wart to fall off. Its not an instant fix. I tried freezing on a small wart twice (each its own seperate attempt). Never worked. I went back to Compound W and low and behold the little bugger is finally gone. I hope I saved you some time and money. Good luck."
1,Complete Garbage,"Gums up so badly you can't use it. I'd rather chop my finger off than use this junk again. And I use my finger often, so that's a pretty strong statement."
3,Effective only for minor warts,"This erosive therapy does work for small warts. Basically it suffocates and erodes the wart, eventually leading to tissue inflammation and necrosis. For larger warts the acid will hardly penetrate to enough depth to bring notable effects. If you have a wart larger than half of the size of your little fingernail, try freezing or laser removal."
1,Useless.,After only a couple uses the liquid dried up. I've used the gel that comes in a tube with much better luck in the past. I'll be switching back.
2,Great for Summer Backpacking-Certian Death in 10 Degree weather,"Pros: Very lite weight, comfortableCons: Is only warm to about 40 degreesI own 2 sleeping bags: one for winter, and the other for the rest of the year. I purchased this bag because of its liteweightedness and its remarkably low comfort raiting. Upon trying this bag for the first time with the tempature below 40 degrees I was unplesantly suprised to discover that the comfort raiting was drastically to low. The best remedy to this problem is to wear more clothing in the sac, or pack along an extra poly blanket.All in all this is a great summer backpacking bag (in the lower 48) but shouldn't be used in the latter half of fall or the begining of spring."
2,Chronic UTI sufferer,"Searching for a remedy besides constant antibiotics, I came across many good reciews of Uva Ursi on the internet. I took this as directed for one week and it did nothing. I didn't notice any change in frequency or pain concerning my UTI infections and discomfort. After the first week and a resting period, as directed, I tried it again for another full week, still with no results.Maybe it works for some people, but it did nothing for me."
2,Not what I was looking for!,"I was hoping this book would give more information about all of the muscular dystrophies, but it seems to focus mostly on Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, which is not helpful to me."
3,ok,"It is ok, not really great, but not really bad either. The gold playing seems a little uneven. But considering the price, well worth it."
4,Excellent (re)view of Peters' ideas,"If you're a Peters reader, most of the material in this book does not seem new. But in his classic fashion, he has managed to again rearrange the most important of his ideas and build upon E-X-P-A-N-D them. Highly recommend this book -- it has the ability to increase your pulse and respiratory rates as you read it!"
2,Boring,"I gave this book 2 stars, one simply because the author was Tom Peters and he has been nothing shy of brillant in his past writings. I have all of his works in hardcover and even found ""Thriving on Chaos"" thought provoking. ""Circle of Innovation"" was disjointed, and sporatic in both thought process and writing style. A laborious read."
1,Information is the enemy of intelligence,"""Information is the enemy of intelligence. The answer? How about...systems?"" So says Tom Peters in a book full of unsystematic information apparently designed for the short-attention span crowd. This is a ""planar"" book--great width and no depth."
3,ok,This was OK but didn't make me want necessarily to go watch the movie ... I would rather see more cost-free movies on Amazon
3,You will need batteries,The product description doesn't make it clear that this product is battery operated and does not include a mains adapter.BUT it is a beautiful piece.
5,Wonderful reference guide to flower gardening,"Crockett's Flower Garden is a fantastic reference book for anyone who enjoys gardening, novice or experienced. The book is written in month-by-month format, which makes it easy to follow and easy to chart your gardening tasks.Crockett's love for gardening shows through, as does his practical approach. He discusses both, buying plants and starting from seed (when practical).I highly recommend the book."
5,Excellent Old Book,"This is a faith stirring book on how to return good for evil with your enemies.Although the stories are quite old, we all can benefit from reading them.This book would be a great one to read to a Sunday School class."
5,Redneck Riviera is Microcosm of GOP Goals,"This book is the Behind the Music of Myrtle Beach, historical, dishy-a real eye opener. Myrtle Beach, SC has undergone explosive growth and thanks to the deep pockets of business and a ""hands-off"" style of local goverance, it's a microcosm of the GOP ideal of allowing business to regulate itself, and the consequences, both human and environmental. It has a fine editorial tone-friendly-not gossipy, educational-not preachy, and it's loaded with facts, figures, statistics and an index. Thinking of moving to the Grand Strand? Interested in contemporary resort or Southern Culture? Ever wonder why Horry County is the way it is?"
4,better than i thougt it was going to be,"The first time I tried to read this book I didn't make it to the second chapter. But I picked it up again and didn't put it down until I finished (2:00am). I was compelled to find out how Grace's relationship with the sister might turn out, or if she and Michael were going to have an affair. But the main question to be answered was; could Grace really be pregnant after all (getting a period doesn't mean your not pregnant). It was like the author was teasing me with all the references to her weight gain. What a plot twist that would have been! I must agree with earlier reviews that her friend, Angie, was a little annoying. Overall this was a good book with entertaining subplots."
1,Poor Recording,"The sound itself is just fine. A little treblely and loud but other than that the sound is pretty good for a ADD. I would very much recommend this cd if it were not for a couple of things. One of the movements ends with 4 seconds cut-off of it. Another movement has a glitch between the transition into the slow movement. Both on cd #1. Too bad because, I'm pretty convinced it was caused in the studio."
3,"Correction: 24cup cooked rice (1.8qt), 10 cup uncooked rice!!!","This is the correct specs for this rice cooker.I will have to return them since the size is for family use. They are not speaking the same language as other people, 24 cup cooked rice? how would the count?"
3,Total Eclipse Of A Career!,"Global fans of Ms. Tyler's may scoff at this skimpy compilation, but for the yanks who'll barely remember ""Total Eclipse Of The Heart"" and ""Holding Out For A Hero,"" this one'll probably do it.The focus is on the Jim Steinman works, with a lot of Todd Rundgren on the side. Small caveat, there's no ""It's A Heartache,"" Bonnie's first stateside hit.""Heartache"" aside, the sound is an improvement over the Nice Price releases, and while Tyler's ""Super Hits"" isn't regulation length, it's a keeper."
5,"Bonnie Tyler, hugely underrated","Super Hits: Bonnie Tyler is awesome.Bonnie Tyler is one of the great female vocalists, and perhaps one of the most underrated.this set of songs is pure magic."
5,5 Stars just for Total Eclipse Of The Heart,"I bought this, ripped the one good song it contains onto my computer then took it back to wal-mart. Bonnie Tyler is a great singer but she should have had some decent songwriters come up with some more good material for her to showcase her talents.Total Eclipse Of The Heart is one of the greatest songs of all time though it ranks up there with Dream Weaver by Gary Wright, Careless Whisper by Wham!, and Freebird by Led Zeppelin. Awesome tune, again. I wept openly when it was sung at my big sister's wedding."
2,Arrive Scratched,The CD does not play well as it is scratched. I didn't pay much for it and I guess that's what one gets. It wasn't worth the effort to return it or try and get a refund.
1,Don't buy,I got this because it was on (bundle) sale. Bad idea. The picture quality is awful. It is only acceptable if used outdoors in broad day light. My phone and camera have better video quality.
3,PC150 review,"The product functions as designed. One complaint is its darkness: even adjust to its maximum, it is not dark enough to show all contains of the copied material (I had a 14 year-old Cannon PC1 which has a darker image than PC150). May be it is a toner problem, but I cannot verify since it comes with the copier (after I changed the toner ordered from Amazon.com, the copied quality was improved to acceptable level. The toner came with the copier was a trash)"
3,Good price,"Not entirely universal. I thought it would have some kind of way to adapt to any size muffler, but it didnt. expect to weld it on."
5,very funny,"I laughed out loud, and I smiled and laughed out loud some more. But these plays are more than funny, they are engaging, many, but not all, of the characters are rich. And in this volumne you get to see Simon grow as a writer."
5,Genius at Work,"Riveting and attention grabbing, HA HA HA from Ultravox burst on the scene in the late 70's only to die a slow record selling death. Although with the right label, John Foxx' angst wasn't totally in vogue despite the fact that the sound was. Genius at work were the three Ultravox albums with John Foxx and although the cold war European point of view can feel dated, the specificity of Foxx' lyrical imagery coupled with a complex environment of punk inspired soundscapes makes for a memorable musical experience."
2,More influential than effective,2 1/2Somewhat inventive new-wave/punk combiners showed energetic promise but doesn't have quite enough thrust to demand attention.
5,Pansy Division is Versatile!,"I'd really like to see Pansy Division do an album of songs like track 6 on this album (The Summer You Let Your Hair Grow Out) and track 3 (I Really Wanted You), because they have grown to the point where you can really rock out to them, but then you are are hit with songs like Dick of Death, which is a GREAT SONG, but makes it hard to play the album to create a make-out mood, y'know? Then again, I'm probably not a young as some of the audience...I wish I'd had this record when I was in high school! A good album with lots of great songs that you really have to sing along to. Clever, playful lyrics and a great hook are Pansy Division specialties."
4,A must have for your collection,"Many of us got up early to watch the funeral on TV, most have also seen it innumerable times in television programs and videos. For your money you get a live recording of the funeral services which means that there will be sounds that were not filtered out as a studio recording would be. An example of this is Elton John's performance of ""Candle in the Wind"", several times you can tell that his mouth got very close to the microphone.The jewel case booklet appears to be a miniature of the funeral program with additional explanatory notes inserted at the appropriate times"
1,this is the worst lulubye cd ever,i got this cd for my 2 sons and my daughter to listen to during naptime and oh my god i had to cut it off it was boring me to tears and i usaly like celine dion save your money its not worth it
3,Pretty but somewhat bland,"There are few songs on here that are quite lovely and serene. But to be honest, the rest are only just OK. I have added it to my collection because I love Celine and I do listen to it on occassion. Its a great album for putting you to sleep :)"
4,across the universe but so close to home...,In this attempt Ms. Apple has made this cover distictively modern and precise to about anyones taste. again she illuminates the lyrics and personifies the harmony comparison to many woman artist of the past. i was captivated with the version and even days i dont listen to her i can renounce the sound throughout my mind... BRAVO!
5,A classic on blu ray...,"Beaches is a classic movie. I had the vhs movie as a teenager and now I purchased the blu-ray. This is a great movie about life, love, and especially friendship. It is incredibly funny, dramatic, sad...it's got a little bit of everything. I have seen this so many times I can recite the lines. If you are purchasing this it is likely because you have already seen it and love it as I do. If you have not seen it and like the kind of movies that make you laugh one minute and cry the next, this is for you. I feel this is a classic I will keep in my movie collection with me throughout my life. I love it!!"
2,Better Books Out There,"Far from being ""closely written,"" Flew's book is often flabby and clumsy. See T. Bachmann's review below for an example (and there are many more like it throughout the book). As other reviewers have noted below, there are plenty of much better introductions to critical reasoning. Try R. Feldman's ""Reason and Argument,"" which may be the best intro to informal logic."
1,Not a good intro to Logic!,"I had no choice--because of lack of these books in the category at Barnes and Noble--to check out this book and ""Logic Made Easy"" by Deborah J. Bennett to try to get a general overview of Logic and critical thinking and I was rather discouraged. These books are not a beginner's guide to Logic; it was intended for advanced logic readers. I never took a logic or critical reasoning class nor have read any books regarding this topic, and I never realized that this discipline of study is really, really difficult to comprehend easily. It's unfortunate that my local bookstore carries such limited books on these. According to the overall good Amazon.com rating , I will try out ""Introduction to Logic"" by Irving M. Copi, Carl Cohen. Hopefully, this book will be more reader friendly."
3,Mediocre,"This book really had a lot going for it.The artwork in the title is quite amazing and can hold its own with most painted comic art (e.g. Moonshadow, Kingdom Come, Lucifer, Golden Age, etc.).The story has some fascinating insights in to alternate history and it deals heavily with the troubles of nationalism, religion and militarism coming together.But the execution of the story is troublesome. Does it want to be an Italo Calvino style abstract fairly tale or does it want to be a Nausicaa style post-apocalyptic ecological fable? I'm not entirely sure the story has any idea, it tries to get both streams at once but the elements seem to conflict with each other.When I read this, I had the sinking feeling that it was supposed to unfold over thirty issues. And, as a thirty issue series, it actually would have been kind of cool when it moves to the shocking revelations.As a single slim volume, you get something that is rushed, messy and rather confusing.Sadly, it doesn't work."
4,"Awsome! But ""what's Missing""?","Listen guy's, I had my ""discontinued"" Best of love"" By Alex O'Neal cd stolen from my car CD changer & I almost cried! But, guess what... I found it in a remote CD store in a small town called Halmstad in SWEDEN! Can you believe it! I won't sell it for a thousand dollars! Wassup with Sony & Tabu? Let us continue to enjoy Alex's great singing talents!"
4,"Very functional, space saving, no problems","I received this set as a wedding gift two years ago and all three pieces work well. I especially like the spoons - they save so much space by having multiple measurements in one spoon (as opposed to a separate spoon for each measurement). They are easy to clean and easy to use. The cup is good for peanut butter and shortening, but I don't use it for liquids. I really like my adjust-a-measure set and would recommend it to friends and family."
2,review,The measuring spoons are hard to use and the handles are not comfortable. It is nice to have all the measurements in one spoon. Had I seen this product in the store I most likely would not have bought it.
3,Love the spoons hate the cup,"I bought one of the spoons more than 5 years ago and it was great, in the end the rubber on top split but I had it so long and used it so often I wanted to replace it. I bought these and the quality is not as good as it was previously, the spoons tarnished in the first month but still work fine. This is the first time I have owned the cup measure and it is not practical, the top broke in the first few days, I superglued it and used it but I found it difficult to get an accurate measure and liquids would always spill because there is no pourer."
4,Alpha-fun!,"My toddler loves books, and she really gets excited by the smaller sized books (for whatever reason). She has no problem handling bigger books, but she really seems to enjoy the smaller more versatile books. She loves the images in these! There are clip art, real life photos and even images of painted art! There are so many books (26 to be exact) so it's no big deal that each letter book has only 4 pictures (which is 104 images total){P.S. I would check Toys R Us first before ordering through Amazon... it's many many dollars cheaper!}"
2,Too noisy to tell if worked,"The devices are too noisy. Humans can easily hear them, at least all three in the box I received. I didn't keep long enough to tell if they actually worked repelling rodents. Going for the more expensive version from Black and Decker that I used successfully at another residence."
1,Come hither?,"After hearing and seeing evidence of mouse activity in the garage, my husband bought this and we plugged it in right away. From that moment on the sounds went from a little skittering in the evening to non-stop movement day or night!I re-read all of the information on the PestChaser, including the downloadable PDF from Victor, then did a quick search online about mice, and discovered that the sound that this thing emits uses the exact same frequencies as the male house mouse mating call! Why? WHY would they create such a thing and call it a repellant? They claim that it's the volume that bothers them, my guess is that that volume only brought others in from further away.It's getting returned today! We'll go back to relying on our trustworthy friend D-Con!"
3,Victor UltraSonic PestChaser,"I am a real skeptic. But, living in the inner city in an old building, mice have literally moved in on demand! Various obvious methods of ridding myself of this problem did not work for very long. Why did I end up buying this? When I picked up a brand new family pack of pancake mix from the top of my fridge and saw the half-dollar size whole them little critters did, I absolutely lost it and now it's WAR!!! I read about this product and decided to try it. Believe me, if it works or doesn't, I will post. Give me about a week and come back."
4,Transformers Season 3,"Best of all the sets. but severely lacking in the special features department as all the sets have been. Luckily it's worth it just for the episode ""Call of the Primitives"". This has some of the best animation in the whole series, almost if not better then The Movie!"
2,Quite Disappointing!,"A wonderful beginning gives way to a mish-mash of verbiage. This is not a book, but a splice job of a book that was far from finished. The Invisible Man is a masterpiece, but these are simply loose ideas floating around."
3,try the Audio version,I found the book a little too much for my liking. But the audio version(Blair Underwood-reader)excellant. He has a wonderful voice and captures the spirit of the story.
1,A Memory of Love,"Not like her other books at all. More recent works including this one seemed to be rushed there is not the magic of the story like there is with Love Wild and fair, Skye O'Malley, or A Love for All time, just to name a few. Though I read the book cover to cover I was disgusted with the fact that I had paid fifteen dollars for that. The battle scene with Rhowyn was hyped in the synopis and jacket covers but it only lasted for three pages. I was expecting a strong feamle character and was extremely disappointed. Unlike many of her other books I was not drawen into the story of the principle female character. It seems like Small is writing books these days only to earn the money. She has come out with several books each year recently and they seem poorly written compared to her earlier works."
3,"Enjoyable, but not as memorable as her older ones....",I did enjoy this book and finished in less than a day and a half. The plot was kind of sketchy in my opinion and next thing I knew we were off to another harem! I've read all of her books and nothing compares to Skye O'Malley which is one of her best characters.
4,Exactly what you'd expect...,"If you've ever seen these before, then this is exactly what you'd expect. Sturdy and well made, easy to assemble (takes about 2 minutes), these do a super job. They're tough, too. The box this was delivered in was practically demolished - one side was ripped open and crushed, but the stool didn't even have a scratch. Very handy, very stable. SPring-loaded wheels allow you to move it easily, then it drops and ""locks"" into place when you step on it. You need one of these."
1,Piece of JUNK DO NOT BUY!!!,"I'm not sure what all the other reviewers are thinking but this isn't worth $5. Make sure you examine before you put it together because it says it cannot be separated to return. It is made of cheap metal. The bottom piece is all warped and distorted, more like an oval then a circle. It wobbles and isn't sturdy at all. I cannot believe this is carried by good stores like crate and barrel. Do not but this. Don't even accept it for free. Run away. I tried to warn you."
3,mixed,this product is not of the quality of the more expensive ones. It still does the job but some of the black rubber rings are coming off and the wheels do not sit squarely on the floor and it looks lopsided when not in use. This does not seem to effect the stability when standing on it. If my budget would have allowed I would buy the more costly product. They are graded by weight limitations.
5,What I expected,"This fully meets my expectations. It comes in 2 parts and to assemble you just snap the top part onto the bottom part. (note, once assembled it is assembled for life and cannot be taken apart) It slides across the floor easily and stays firmly in place when I step on it. The color in the Amazon photo is not accurate, as another reviewer pointed out, I bought the blue one. The photo shows a lighter blue while it is actually navy blue, which is exactly what I was looking for. I have owned another one of these for the last 25 years so I can attest to the quality and durability. I would buy this again and recommend it."
5,What I was looking for,"I'm recovering from back surgery and it is still a little difficult to bend and stoop. This stool is the perfect height for sitting on (instead of stooping) and also for safely using as a step stool. I have great confidence that the stool will not be ""rolling"" while I am using it. Great purchase!"
2,Junky,"This was one of the worst laid out hunks of junk ever put out for D&D. To demonstrate how poorly done this is, one only has to realize that the 2nd edition Complete Psionicist Handbook was better and anybody who had the mosfortune of owning that horrible thing knows this one has to be bad.Save you money! It's garbage!"
2,Doing the numbers,"The book should have been called 'The fighers/monks book of probability'. The book is essentially a character maxing book, with sparse artwork, bland descriptions and little weight in both writing style and actual pounds and onces. It is a shallow attempt that is far surpassed by its earlier incarnation made for 2nd edition. All the character and grit most of us were expecting of this new player's guide is sadly not here. This is a great how to book, but lacks style, origionality and playable prestige classes. Overall I would say; buy it, read it and send it back."
3,Not bad,"Fighters always get the short end of the stick - their book comes out first and is the template from which the other books blossom. S&F; is yet again the weakest link of the expanded class books that have been put out.Most of the new feats are geared towards monks and the included fighter feats are mostly throw-aways.The prestige classes are interesting - especially the Weapon Master (the old Kensai class), Drunken Master and Lasher. The prestige classes are divided pretty evenly between those that would appeal to monks and those that would appeal to fighters.The weapon section contains a few nice weapons (mercurial weapons stand out as the best), but again, most are designed for monks. Unfortunately, a lot of space is wasted on fighter ""types"" or ""paths"" and combat tactics, a lot of which is ""who cares?"" kind of stuff.You can live without the book if your and experienced player, but those new to D&D; will find it helpful for envisioning, creating and playing fighters - and monks."
